https://openalex.org/W1977024178,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is associated with acquired or congenital deficiency of a plasma von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease (VWFCP). Based on partial amino acid sequence, VWFCP was identified recently as a new member of the ADAMTS family of metalloproteases and designated ADAMTS13. The 4.6-kilobase pair cDNA sequence for VWFCP has now been determined. By Northern blotting, full-length VWFCP mRNA was detected only in liver. VWFCP consists of 1427 amino acid residues and has a signal peptide, a short propeptide terminating in the sequence RQRR, a reprolysin-like metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a thrombospondin-1 repeat, a Cys-rich domain, an ADAMTS spacer, seven additional thrombospondin-1 repeats, and two CUB domains. VWFCP apparently is made as a zymogen that requires proteolytic activation, possibly by furin intracellularly. Sites for Zn2+ and Ca2+ ions are conserved in the protease domain. The Cys-rich domain contains an RGDS sequence that could mediate integrin-dependent binding to platelets or other cells. Alternative splicing gives rise to at least seven potential variants that truncate the protein at different positions after the protease domain. Alternative splicing may have functional significance, producing proteins with distinct abilities to interact with cofactors, connective tissue, platelets, and von Willebrand factor."
https://openalex.org/W1986906983,"Proper folding of proteins (either newly synthesized or damaged in response to a stressful event) occurs in a highly regulated fashion. Cytosolic chaperones such as Hsc/Hsp70 are assisted by cofactors that modulate the folding machinery in a positive or negative manner. CHIP (carboxyl terminus ofHsc70-interacting protein) is such a cofactor that interacts with Hsc70 and, in general, attenuates its most well characterized functions. In addition, CHIP accelerates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of chaperone substrates. Using an <i>in vitro</i> ubiquitylation assay with recombinant proteins, we demonstrate that CHIP possesses intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and promotes ubiquitylation. This activity is dependent on the carboxyl-terminal U-box. CHIP interacts functionally and physically with the stress-responsive ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family UBCH5. Surprisingly, a major target of the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP is Hsc70 itself. CHIP ubiquitylates Hsc70, primarily with short, noncanonical multiubiquitin chains but has no appreciable effect on steady-state levels or half-life of this protein. This effect may have heretofore unanticipated consequences with regard to the chaperoning activities of Hsc70 or its ability to deliver substrates to the proteasome. These studies demonstrate that CHIP is a <i>bona fide</i> ubiquitin ligase and indicate that U-box-containing proteins may comprise a new family of E3s."
https://openalex.org/W1984573021,"Ligand-dependent down-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been shown to limit hormone responsiveness, but the mechanisms involved in this process are poorly understood. The glucocorticoid receptor is a phosphoprotein that upon ligand binding becomes hyperphosphorylated, and recent evidence indicates that phosphorylation status of the glucocorticoid receptor plays a prominent role in receptor protein turnover. Because phosphorylation is a key signal for ubiquitination and proteasomal catabolism of many proteins, we evaluated whether the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway had a role in glucocorticoid receptor down-regulation and the subsequent transcriptional response to glucocorticoids. Pretreatment of COS-1 cells expressing mouse glucocorticoid receptor with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 effectively blocks glucocorticoid receptor protein down-regulation by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Interestingly, both MG-132 and a second proteasome inhibitor β-lactone significantly enhanced hormone response of transfected mouse glucocorticoid receptor toward transcriptional activation of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated reporter gene expression. The transcriptional activity of the endogenous human glucocorticoid receptor in HeLa cells was also enhanced by MG-132. Direct evidence for ubiquitination of the glucocorticoid receptor was obtained by immunoprecipitation of cellular extracts from proteasome-impaired cells. Examination of the primary sequence of mouse, human, and rat glucocorticoid receptor has identified a candidate PEST degradation motif. Mutation of Lys-426 within this PEST element both abrogated ligand-dependent down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor protein and simultaneously enhanced glucocorticoid receptor-induced transcriptional activation of gene expression. Unlike wild type GR, proteasomal inhibition failed to enhance significantly transcriptional activity of K426A mutant GR. Together these findings suggest a major role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in regulating glucocorticoid receptor protein turnover, thereby providing a mechanism to terminate glucocorticoid responses.

Synthetic derivatives of glucocorticoids are widely used in the treatment of a number of inflammatory diseases. These hormones are necessary for normal growth and development, liver and immune functions, and in mediating stress responses (1Barnes P.J. Clin. Sci. 1998; 94: 557-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar, 2Mendel D.B. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Nature. 1986; 324: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Sapolsky R.M. Romero L.M. Munck A.U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5478) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids mediate their actions by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR),1 a member of the superfamily of steroid/thyroid/retinoic acid proteins that function as ligand-dependent transcription factors. Like other members of this superfamily, GR contains a number of structure motifs including a DNA binding domain, ligand binding domain, and two transactivation motifs AF1 and AF2 (4Kumar R. Thompson E.B. Steroids. 1999; 64: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the cytoplasmic GR becomes activated and translocates to the nucleus where it can bind to specific DNA elements termed glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), causing stimulation of transcription. Alternatively, activated GR can interact with other transcription factors such as NF-κB or AP-1 to repress gene expression activated by these pro-inflammatory transcription factors (5Mangelsdorf D.J.

The sensitivity of cells to glucocorticoids has been shown to be dependent on the number of GRs found in the cell (9Cidlowski J.A. Cidlowski N.B.

Upon ligand binding the GR undergoes a process of homologous down-regulation that has been extensively studied (9Cidlowski J.A. Cidlowski N.B.

GR levels are regulated at multiple levels including mRNA and protein (16Oakley R.H. Cidlowski J.A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 63-88PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schmidt T.J. Meyer A.S. Receptor. 1994; 4: 229-257PubMed Google Scholar). At the RNA level, several studies have shown that glucocorticoid treatment decreases GR mRNA levels by 50–80% in many different tissues (18Okret S. Poellinger L. Dong Y. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5899-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 19Dong Y. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. Okret S. Mol.

This occurs via transcriptional mechanisms requiring an intragenic element within the GR gene itself (20Burnstein K.L. Jewell C.M. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1764-1773PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, early studies showed that hormone treatment leads to a subsequent decrease in the ability of the receptor to bind hormone, but the mechanism for this phenomena was poorly understood. Dense amino acid labeling of3H-labeled steroid-bound receptor suggested that hormone treatment influenced receptor protein turnover (12McIntyre W.R. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 418-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of GR-specific antibodies permitted analysis of GR protein and revealed that ligand binding of GR led to a reduction in receptor protein levels (10Hoeck W. Rusconi S. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14396-14402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Dong Y. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. Okret S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Studies examining the half-life of the GR protein, separate from any ligand effects on RNA, have shown that ligand occupation of the receptor significantly decreases GR protein half-life from 18 to 9 h. Recently, the phosphorylation state of the receptor has been shown to be an important determinant of receptor stability, and a phospho-deficient mutant of mouse GR does not undergo ligand-dependent down-regulation (21Webster J.C. Jewell C.M. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9287-9293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation has been shown to act as a signal for protein recognition by the ubiquitin and proteasome pathways for protein degradation, we considered the possibility that the proteasome mediates GR down-regulation (22Fuchs S.Y.

Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Proteins such as IκBα, Fos, and the tumor suppresser p53 have been shown to be regulated by this pathway with phosphorylation playing a critical role (26Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F.

Phosphorylation is thought to be the signal to allow substrate recognition by enzymes in the ubiquitination pathway. The ubiquitin pathway consists of ubiquitin-activating enzymes (UBAs), E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBCs), and E3 ubiquitin-ligase enzymes. Phosphorylation allows recognition by E2 and/or E3 molecules that covalently add the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin to lysine residue(s) of the targeted protein (26Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J.

Poly-ubiquitination of a protein allows it to be recognized by the multisubunit protein complex known as the proteasome, which degrades the protein into small peptides and amino acids. Recent development of specific inhibitors of the proteasome has permitted identification of its central role in the turnover of both short lived and long lived proteins (31Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar, 32Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L.

The glucocorticoid receptor has been shown recently to interact with an E2-conjugating protein and two E3-ligase proteins found within the ubiquitin enzymatic pathway, but the functional consequences of GR interaction with these proteins remain unclear. We report here that inhibition of the proteasome by MG-132 abolishes dexamethasone-induced mouse glucocorticoid receptor protein down-regulation. By using the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and β-lactone, we demonstrate enhanced hormone responsiveness by use of a glucocorticoid response element-containing reporter construct. By immunoprecipitation of GR protein, we have visualized higher molecular weight forms of the glucocorticoid receptor that we have identified as ubiquitinated forms of GR. Mutagenesis of lysine 426, found in a candidate PEST degradation motif within the glucocorticoid receptor, abrogated ligand-dependent down-regulation, enhanced hormone responsiveness, and was found to be unresponsive to proteasome inhibition. Together these findings suggest a mechanism for termination of glucocorticoid-dependent glucocorticoid receptor signaling via protein degradation through the proteasome pathway. Dexamethasone (1,4-pregnadien-9α-fluoro-16α-methyl-11β,17,21-triol-3,20-dione) (Dex) was purchased from Steraloids (Wilton, NH). MG-132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde) and clasto-latacystin β-lactone were purchased from Calbiochem. N-Ethylmaleimide was purchased from Pierce. [14C]Chloramphenicol (40–60 mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Acetyl coenzyme A, Mini Complete tablets, Pefabloc, and aprotinin protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies and the ECL chemiluminescent detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Wild type and mutant mouse GR were expressed in the pSV2Rec vector under the control of the SV40 promoter (35Danielsen M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 2286-2291PubMed Google Scholar). pCMV5-mGR was also used in some experiments, and detailed descriptions of this expression vector are available (36Tilley W.D. Marcelli M. Wilson J.D. McPhaul M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Mutation of mouse glucocorticoid receptor cDNA from Lys-426 to K426A was done by polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange Site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). Primers used were 5′-ACG GGA CCA CCT CCC GCA CTC TGC CTG GTG TGC-3′ and 5′-GCA CAC CAG GCA GAG TGC GGG AGG TGG TCC CGT −3′. GRE2-TATA-CAT and GRE2-TATA-Luc reporter plasmids have been previously described (37Allgood V.E. Powell-Oliver F.E. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

The c-Myc-tagged ubiquitin expression vector (wt-H6M-Ub) was a kind gift of Ron Kopito (39Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). COS-1 (African Green monkey kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% (v/v) of a 1:1 mixture of heat-inactivated fetal calf/calf serum (Summit Biotechnology, Ft. Collins, CO) and 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were grown in monolayer cultures in Joklik's minimum essential medium and harvested with Versene as described previously (40Scheible P.P. DeLorenzo T.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1987; 26: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). All cultures were maintained in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and passaged every 3–4 days. For transfection of cells, cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection and allowed to grow to 50–70% confluency. Cells were washed with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected using DMRIEC (Life Technologies, Inc.) or TransIT transfection reagent from Panvera Corp. (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. The precipitates were incubated with cells for 5 h. The Opti-MEM media was removed, and media containing dextran-charcoal stripped serum were added. Plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiagen Maxiprep kits (Valencia, CA). Cells were transfected as described above. Following transfections, media were changed to media containing dextran/charcoal-stripped serum, and cells were allowed to recover for 12–16 h and then treated with vehicle or dexamethasone for the times indicated. Cells were harvested and lysates prepared, and luciferase assay was performed using an Enhanced Luciferase Assay Kit from BD PharMingen (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Luciferase activity was measured using a Microtiter Plate Luminometer and Revelation 4.06 Software (Dynex Technologies). Luciferase activity was calculated per μg of protein for each sample. Cells were transfected as described above. HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and incubated with Versene at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were spun down for 5 min and taken up in 0.25 m EDTA (pH 8.0). Lysates were prepared by tip sonication, and endogenous CAT activity was inactivated by heating to 65 °C for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford, using a reagent kit from Bio-Rad. Equal amounts of protein were incubated in reactions with acetyl coenzyme A and 0.1 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol. Reactions were terminated by ethyl acetate extraction, and CAT activities were determined by thin layer chromatography (TLC) separation of acetylated products from substrate chloramphenicol. Plates were visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc. Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed using ImageQuant software. Activity was expressed as percent chloramphenicol acetylation. In some experiments CAT activity was determined by terminating reactions by the mixed xylene method as described by Promega (Madison, WI) and utilized a standard curve of CAT activity from supplied protein. In protein half-life studies using the mouse GR vector pSV2wRec and mutant GR GRK426A cellular extracts were prepared from transiently transfected COS-1 cells pretreated with 1 μm cycloheximide for 1 h and then treated with vehicle or 100 nm dexamethasone. Cells were washed with cold 1× PBS and harvested by scraping with a rubber spatula into PBS, and cells were centrifuged. The cell pellet was taken up in RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5)) containing protease inhibitors 1 μg/ml aprotinin, Pefabloc, and Mini Complete protease inhibitor tablet from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein levels were quantitated using the Lowry method (Bio-Rad). Approximately 100 μg of protein per sample was resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and stained with Ponceau S (0.5% in 1% acetic acid) to evaluate loading equivalency and transfer efficiency. BenchMark Prestained Protein ladders from Life Technologies, Inc., were used to determine molecular size of visualized bands. Membranes were placed in a blocking solution of 10% nonfat milk (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight in a cold room. Membranes were then washed two times for 15 min with 1% nonfat milk buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated for 1 h with anti-GR epitope-purified polyclonal antibody 1857 at a dilution of 1:2000. After two 15-min washes, the membrane was then incubated with 1% milk buffer with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody at a dilution of 1:15,000 (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was washed as described and reacted for 1 min with chemiluminescent reagents commercially supplied (ECL). Blots were processed for autoradiography, and signals were quantitated by using NIH Image densitometry software. Cellular lysates from COS-1 cells were prepared in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors 1 μg/ml aprotinin and Pefabloc, Mini Complete protease inhibitor tablet from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (26Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). Addition ofN-ethylmaleimide to isolated cellular extracts inhibits isopeptidase activities that may otherwise affect the detection of ubiquitinated proteins (26Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate GR, a 1:1 mixture of antibodies 57 and 59, epitope-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies, were added to 200 μg of cellular extract, and samples were rotated at 4 °C overnight (41McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1222-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 42Cidlowski J.A. Bellingham D.L. Powell-Oliver F.E. Lubahn D.B. Sar M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose was added and samples were rotated for 2 h. Sepharose was pelleted, and samples were washed 5× in a large volume of IP buffer. Samples were taken up in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min to dissociate immune complexes from Sepharose. Equal volumes of samples were run on SDS-PAGE and BenchMark Prestained Protein ladders from Life Technologies, Inc., were used to determine molecular size of visualized bands. Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized using GR-specific peptide antibody 1857, as described above. Blots were also probed with anti-c-Myc antibody from Babco (Richmond, CA) to detect Myc-tagged ubiquitin GR conjugates. Immunoprecipitated GR was run on SDS-PAGE gels, and blots were probed with an anti-ubiquitin antibody that was the generous gift of Dr. Arthur Haas (43Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical significance was determined using a t test with a confidence level of 0.05. Western blot data was determined for significance by using pixel data from NIH Image Software, and CAT assay data were visualized using PhosphorImager technology and ImageQuant software from Molecular Dynamics, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Glucocorticoid receptor ligand-dependent down-regulation is thought to be a complex process involving regulation of both GR receptor gene expression and receptor protein. Regulation at the RNA and the protein levels occurs simultaneously and has been demonstrated in numerous studies using transcriptional or translational inhibitors. With the development of GR-specific antibodies, it has been shown in a number of tissues and cell types that in the presence of ligand GR protein becomes destabilized and receptor levels decrease (10Hoeck W. Rusconi S. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14396-14402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Burnstein K.L. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol.

Interestingly, disruption of GR interaction with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) also leads to GR protein down-regulation, and inhibition of the proteasome function has recently been shown to block this down-regulation (44Whitesell L. Cook P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus we wished to determine the role of the proteasome in ligand-dependent down-regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor. To address this issue the COS-1 cell line (which is devoid of endogenous GR) was transfected with pSV2Rec, a mouse GR expression vector. Following transfection cells were pretreated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde) or vehicle for 1 h and then were treated with vehicle or dexamethasone. Cellular extracts were isolated, and Western blot analysis of GR was performed with peptide-specific antibodies. Glucocorticoid treatment caused a profound decrease in the levels of GR protein (Fig.1, 1st versus 2nd lanes) that was inhibited by the inclusion of MG-132 (Fig. 1, 2nd versus 4th lanes). Densitometric analysis of three separate experiments revealed that MG-132 abrogated the repressive effect of dexamethasone on GR protein levels. Dexamethasone treatment for 12 h caused GR protein levels to fall on average to 42% of control, whereas cells pretreated with MG-132 maintained normal receptor levels. The ability of the proteasome inhibitors to block ligand-dependent glucocorticoid receptor protein down-regulation suggests that the GR is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To ascertain if the observed receptors preserved by proteasome inhibition were functional, assays were performed using glucocorticoid-responsive reporter genes. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pSV2Rec GR expression vector and hormonally responsive GRE2-TATA-CAT. Transfected cells were pretreated with MG-132 and then treated with various doses of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone treatment induced reporter activity, whereas MG-132 alone had little effect on activity (Fig.2 A). In contrast cells treated with MG-132 and dexamethasone showed significantly increased reporter activity compared with cells treated with Dex alone. Percent CAT conversion levels increased 3–4-fold in cells treated with MG-132 and Dex. Similar observations were made when cells were treated with clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (β-lactone), a second more specific inhibitor of the proteasome (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest the receptors maintained by proteasome inhibition during glucocorticoid treatment are functional and further suggest that hormone responsiveness may be limited by glucocorticoid receptor protein down-regulation via the proteasome pathway. Because studies in transfected cells overexpressing glucocorticoid receptor suggested that proteasome inhibition blocked glucocorticoid-induced down-regulation and maintained functional responsiveness, we wished to determine whether the proteasome plays a similar role in cells that contain endogenous human GR. The HeLa cell line was utilized to address this question because these cells express hGR endogenously, and the down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor protein by treatment with dexamethasone has been well documented in this cell line (9Cidlowski J.A. Cidlowski N.B. Endocrinology. 1981; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Burnstein K.L. Bellingham D.L. Jewell C.M. Powell-Oliver F.E. Cidlowski J.A. Steroids. 1991; 56: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of GR protein levels has been proposed to be the limiting factor in HeLa cells responsiveness to glucocorticoids (11Silva C.M. Powell-Oliver F.E. Jewell C.M. Sar M. Allgood V.E.

To examine if inhibiting the proteasome protein degradation pathway affected GR responsiveness in HeLa cells, we again used the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and analyzed the effects of proteasome inhibition on hormone responsiveness in HeLa cells transfected with a hormone-responsive dimer GRE driving the CAT reporter gene. Following transfection, cells were pretreated with MG-132 and then were treated with dexamethasone. Cells treated with MG-132 demonstrated only a slightly higher percent CAT conversion than control, whereas dexamethasone markedly induced activity over the control (Fig. 3). In contrast, HeLa cells treated with a combination of MG-132 and dexamethasone showed significantly induced repor"

DNA is licensed for replication after mitosis in G1, and passage through S-phase removes the license to replicate. In fission yeast, Cdc6/18 and Cdt1, two factors required for licensing, are central to ensuring that replication occurs once per cell cycle. We show that the human Cdt1 homologue (hCdt1), a nuclear protein, is present only during G1. After S-phase onset, hCdt1 levels decrease, and it is hardly detected in cells in early S-phase or G2. hCdt1 can associate with the DNA replication inhibitor Geminin, however these two proteins are mostly expressed at different cell cycle stages. hCdt1 mRNA, in contrast to hCdt1 protein, is expressed in S-phase-arrested cells, and its levels do not change dramatically during a cell cycle, suggesting that proteolytic rather than transcriptional controls ensure the timely accumulation of hCdt1. Consistent with this view, proteasome inhibitors stabilize hCdt1 in S-phase. In contrast, hCdc6/18 levels are constant through most of the cell cycle and are only low for a brief period at the end of mitosis. These results suggest that the presence of active hCdt1 may be crucial for determining when licensing is legitimate in human cells.

Cell cycle progression is globally regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1 required at both S- and M-phase. The mitotic CDK activity, essential for M-phase entry, has an additional role in preventing G2 cells from re-initiating S-phase (1Wuarin J. Nurse P.

The re-setting to G1 allowing the initiation of S-phase is achieved by inactivation of the mitotic CDK, which normally occurs at the end of mitosis. When CDK activity is inappropriately inhibited in G2, however, cells are reset to initiate S-phase without entering into mitosis (3Usui T. Yoshida M. Abe K. Osada H. Isono K. Beppu T. J.

Thus, CDK activity is required for ensuring that replication is limited to once per cycle.The timely initiation of DNA replication is controlled through a process (called licensing), which ensures that only after passage through mitosis does chromatin become competent for a new round of replication (8Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Studies mainly in the budding and fission yeasts and with Xenopus egg extracts have lead to a model of how licensing occurs. Licensing involves the stepwise formation of pre-replicative complexes on chromatin at the end of mitosis (9Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 10Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev.

The Origin Recognition Complex associates with chromatin throughout the cell cycle and, at least in the yeasts, marks origins of replication, where it acts as a landing pad for the formation of pre-replicative complexes (13Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 14Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). When CDK activity drops at the end of M-phase, Cdc6/18 associates with origins and loads the MCM complex onto chromatin (15Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G.

Tada S. Nature. 2000; 404: 560-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cdt1 is conserved from fission yeast to mammalian cells, although no good homologue has yet been reported for budding yeast (22Whittaker A.J. Royzman I. Orr-Weaver T.L.

At the G1/S transition, the licensed origins are activated by two protein kinases, the CDK-cyclin and Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase, and the loading of Cdc45 and DNA polymerase alpha onto origins, leading to the initiation of DNA replication (25Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 26Johnston L.H. Masai H. Sugino A. Prog.

This control is essential for once per cell cycle replication in fission yeast, because ectopic high level expression of Cdc18 leads to continued DNA synthesis in the absence of mitosis (28Nishitani H. Nurse P. Cell. 1995; 83: 397-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar,29Muzi-Falconi M. Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cdc6 in budding yeast and Cdc18 in fission yeast are phosphorylated by CDKs and are thereby targeted for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis both at S-phase and in mitosis (30Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5966-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 31Kominami K. Toda T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1548-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Jallepalli P.V.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5689-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fission yeast Cdt1 (SpCdt1) is also tightly controlled through the cycle being expressed only in G1cells (20Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The Cdc10 G1/S transcriptional complex regulates SpCdt1 mRNA expression (19Hofmann J.F. Beach D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), similar to fission yeast Cdc18 (34Kelly T.J. Martin G.S. Forsburg S.L. Stephen R.J. Russo A. Nurse P. Cell. 1993; 74: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Whether SpCdt1 is regulated post-translationally by phosphorylation and/or proteolysis remains unknown. The timely expression of SpCdt1 appears important for once per cell cycle replication, because its ectopic expression potentiates the Cdc18-induced re-replication (20Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Other putative targets mediating the CDK block to re-replication are Origin Recognition Complex subunits, which are differentially phosphorylated through the cell cycle (35Weinreich M. Liang C. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,36Lygerou Z. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3703-3712PubMed Google Scholar), and the MCM proteins, which dissociate from chromatin as DNA replication proceeds (37Hendrickson M. Madine M. Dalton S. Gautier J. Proc. Natl.

Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, one of the MCM subunits, Mcm4, is excluded from the nucleus when phosphorylated by the CDK Cdc28 (40Labib K. Diffley J.F. Kearsey S.E. Nat. Cell.

Although theCdc6/18 gene is a target of E2F (42Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 43Hateboer G.

After the onset of S-Phase, soluble Cdc6/18 is phosphorylated by CDKs and is exported to the cytoplasm (44Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell.

Chromatin-bound Cdc6/18, however, appears constant for most of the cell cycle (45Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25927-25932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 46Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that licensing is not primarily controlled by the presence of Cdc6/18 on chromatin. In vertebrates, in addition to CDK regulation, licensing is negatively controlled by Geminin, a protein expressed from S-phase to the end of mitosis. Ectopic expression of Geminin in aXenopus replication system in vitro inhibits MCM loading onto chromatin (52McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that Geminin can form a complex with Cdt1, both in Xenopus and human cell extracts (53Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 54Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), suggesting that Geminin inhibits licensing by binding to and inactivating the MCM loading factor Cdt1. Geminin is targeted for proteolysis at the end of mitosis by the Anaphase Promoting Complex, and its degradation is essential for the subsequent licensing of chromatin for replication (52McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar).In this report we characterize the human homologue of Cdt1 (hCdt1) and show that, unlike hCdc6/18, hCdt1 protein levels are tightly controlled so that hCdt1 is only present in G1, when licensing takes place, whereas it disappears after S-phase onset. Proteolysis, rather than transcription, appears to be primarily responsible for the periodic accumulation of hCdt1. hCdt1 can form a complex with the licensing inhibitor Geminin, however these two proteins are not co-expressed in cells for most of the cell cycle.DISCUSSIONWe have characterized a human member of the Cdt1 family of licensing factors. Fission yeast and Xenopus Cdt1 family members are required for the loading of the MCM proteins onto chromatin upon mitotic exit, thereby licensing DNA for a new round of DNA replication (20Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). hCdt1 contains all the Cdt1 family conserved domains (data not shown, 24) and is highly homologous toXenopus Cdt1 (45% overall identity). The N terminus of the protein is more divergent (29% identity to Xenopus Cdt1) and is shorter than Xenopus Cdt1 by 80 amino acids, which accounts for the difference in size between the human andXenopus proteins (65 versus 75 kDa, respectively). The N terminus has several SP or TP putative phosphorylation sites as well as a consensus CDK phosphorylation site (SPXR). Xenopus Cdt1 is phosphorylated in metaphase of meiosis II, and we observed a similar band shift in HeLa cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole, making it likely that hCdt1 is phosphorylated in a mitotic block. hCdt1 may also be phosphorylated during S-Phase (see below).hCdt1, like fission yeast Cdt1, localizes to the nucleus. A putative bipartite nuclear localization signal can be found at the N terminus of hCdt1 (amino acids 48RKRAR … RRRLR71), which may be responsible for directing hCdt1 to the nucleus. hCdt1 is more concentrated in the nucleoli. Whether the accumulation of hCdt1 in the nucleolus has any role in regulating its activity, as shown for other cell cycle proteins (reviewed in Ref. 56Carmo-Fonseca M. Mendes-Soares L. Campos I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E107-E112Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), remains to be investigated. It is interesting to note in that respect that Geminin, which is believed to negatively regulate Cdt1, appears excluded from the nucleoli of interphase HeLa cells.Licensing must be restricted to G1 so that DNA replication only takes place once in each cell cycle. In mammalian cells the levels of most initiation factors (MCM family members, Origin Recognition Complex components, and Cdc6/18) appear relatively stable for most of the cell cycle. Soluble hCdc6/18 is exported to the cytoplasm in S-phase, in a process regulated by Cdk2/cyclin A; chromatin-bound hCdc6/18, however, persists in S and G2 (42Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B.

How then is licensing restricted to G1? We show here that hCdt1, a protein essential for licensing in fission yeast andXenopus, is only present when licensing is appropriate. The hCdt1 protein accumulates soon after cells exit mitosis and remains at high levels through G1. As cells enter S-phase, hCdt1 protein levels fall and remain low for G2 and M. hCdt1 was not detected in cells arrested in early S-phase by a number of different blocks, indicating that hCdt1 becomes unstable upon initiation of S-phase. The oscillation of hCdt1 protein levels, similar to that of fission yeast Cdc18 and Cdt1, may therefore be important for restraining origin re-firing in S- and G2-phase in human cells.How is the timely accumulation of hCdt1 achieved? We show that hCdt1 mRNA is expressed in cells arrested in S-phase, and mRNA levels do not change dramatically through the cell cycle. In contrast, proteasome inhibitors stabilize hCdt1 in S-phase, suggesting that the periodic accumulation of hCdt1 is mainly due to proteolytic control. The SCF-dependent proteolytic pathway is activated at G1/S, and SCF targets are marked for degradation by CDK-dependent phosphorylation (57Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 58Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). hCdt1 has a consensus site for CDK phosphorylation and, close to it, the sequence PARRRLRL, which is similar to the cyclin-Cdk2 binding site found in E2F3 (PAKRRLEL (59Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K. Wu A.D. Nalin C.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6623-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 60Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar)). The decrease in hCdt1 protein levels closely mirrors the accumulation of cyclin A, suggesting that hCdt1 may be phosphorylated by a cyclin A-CDK complex and targeted for SCF-dependent proteolysis in S-phase. Consistently, hCdt1 accumulating upon treatment of S-phase-arrested cells with proteasome inhibitors has a somewhat reduced mobility in comparison to exponential cells, which could be due to phosphorylation, whereas a ladder of retarded bands can be detected upon longer exposure, which could correspond to ubiquitinylated intermediates.hCdt1 levels are also inversely correlated with the levels of the licensing inhibitor Geminin. Geminin can interact with hCdt1 in extracts from human cells (Ref. 53Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar and this study), the two proteins, however, do not appear to be expressed in the same cells in interphase. Although binding to Geminin might target hCdt1 for degradation in human cells, it is more likely that Geminin acts in a redundant pathway to ensure that any hCdt1 escaping degradation will be inactivated by Geminin binding. Geminin accumulates in S-phase, and it was proposed that Geminin inhibition might be essential for restricting origin re-firing when DNA replication is inhibited (52McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 53Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, our data show that hCdt1 levels decrease when cells enter S-phase, and hCdt1 is unstable in three different S-phase blocks (hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, and double-thymidine block) indicating that re-replication is inhibited, at least in part, by S-phase-specific hCdt1 proteolysis. We show that hCdt1 and Geminin both accumulate in a mitotic block, where the presence of Geminin may be particularly important for inhibiting premature licensing. This is similar to Xenopus, where both proteins are present in metaphase-arrested oocytes (21Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 52McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 54Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). hCdt1, Geminin, and hCdc6/18 appear hypermodified in HeLa cells arrested in mitosis, which may also inhibit licensing until the end of mitosis. The modification of hCdt1 in cells arrested in mitosis appears different from the modification in S-phase-arrested cells treated with proteasome inhibitors and may serve a different purpose (e.g.inhibiting hCdt1 function in mitosis versus targeting the protein for degradation in S-phase).Analysis of hCdt1 and Geminin mRNA levels in different human tissues showed that hCdt1 is highly expressed in rapidly proliferating tissues such as the thymus and testis, as expected for a factor implicated in cell cycle progression. Geminin is most highly expressed in the testis, suggesting that hCdt1 inhibition by Geminin may be particularly important in this tissue.Cdt1 is believed to act together with Cdc6/18 to accomplish the loading of MCM proteins onto chromatin (20Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, our data show that hCdt1 and hCdc6/18 are regulated in different ways. hCdc6/18 protein levels are mostly unchanged through the cell cycle and are only low for a brief period in mitosis. We show here that hCdc6/18 is expressed considerably later than hCdt1 in G1, suggesting that the G1 accumulation of hCdt1 and hCdc6/18 is not controlled by the same factors. hCdc6/18 accumulation most closely mirrors the accumulation of cyclin E and hCdc6/18 levels remain high in S-phase and G2, whereas hCdt1 is absent from S- and G2-phase cells and is additionally controlled by binding to Geminin.Why would two proteins with a very similar cellular function be controlled in such different ways? One possibility is that the different modes of regulation ensure that at least one of these essential licensing factors would be correctly expressed and therefore restrain untimely licensing. Ectopic expression of Cdt1 and Cdc18 in fission yeast cells leads to re-replication. Human cells may ensure that such an untimely expression of both proteins never takes place by imposing different modes of regulation upon them. Alternatively, hCdt1 and hCdc6/18, in addition to their common involvement in licensing, may have other roles in the cell, which remain to be identified. To maintain genome integrity, initiation of DNA replication is coordinated with passage through mitosis so that replication is limited to once every cell cycle. Cell cycle progression is globally regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs)1 required at both S- and M-phase. The mitotic CDK activity, essential for M-phase entry, has an additional role in preventing G2 cells from re-initiating S-phase (1Wuarin J. Nurse P. Cell. 1996; 85: 785-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2Nasmyth K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The re-setting to G1 allowing the initiation of S-phase is achieved by inactivation of the mitotic CDK, which normally occurs at the end of mitosis. When CDK activity is inappropriately inhibited in G2, however, cells are reset to initiate S-phase without entering into mitosis (3Usui T. Yoshida M. Abe K. Osada H. Isono K. Beppu T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Hayles J. Fisher D. Woollard A. Nurse P.

Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, CDK activity is required for ensuring that replication is limited to once per cycle. The timely initiation of DNA replication is controlled through a process (called licensing), which ensures that only after passage through mitosis does chromatin become competent for a new round of replication (8Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Studies mainly in the budding and fission yeasts and with Xenopus egg extracts have lead to a model of how licensing occurs. Licensing involves the stepwise formation of pre-replicative complexes on chromatin at the end of mitosis (9Stillman B. Science. 1996; 274: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 10Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev.

The Origin Recognition Complex associates with chromatin throughout the cell cycle and, at least in the yeasts, marks origins of replication, where it acts as a landing pad for the formation of pre-replicative complexes (13Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 14Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). When CDK activity drops at the end of M-phase, Cdc6/18 associates with origins and loads the MCM complex onto chromatin (15Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996;"

Estrogens have key roles in a variety of biological events, such as the development and maintenance of female reproductive organs and bone and lipid metabolism. Previous studies demonstrated that estrogens suppress TGF-β-induced gene expression, such as type IV collagen in kidney mesangial cells. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate this antagonistic effect are unknown. To elucidate the mechanisms of cross-talk between TGF-β and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways, we reconstituted TGF-β and ER signaling in human kidney carcinoma cells. Here we demonstrate that TGF-β-induced activation of Sma and MAD-related protein 3 (Smad3) activity, one of the major intracellular transducers of TGF-β signaling, was suppressed by ER, whereas ER-mediated transcriptional activation was enhanced by TGF-β signaling. We provide evidence that this two-way cross-talk between the estrogen and TGF-β signaling pathways was the result of direct physical interactions between Smad3 and ER.

Cellular homeostasis is maintained by the orchestrated functions of a variety of growth regulatory factors, such as peptide and lipophilic hormones. Interactions between growth factor and estrogen signaling pathways at the level of gene expression play important roles in maintaining reproductive homeostasis (1Ignar-Trowbridge D.M. Pimentel M.

Reprod. 1998; 58: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 is a member of the TGF-β superfamily. In addition to TGF-β, this superfamily includes the activins/inhibins, bone morphogenetic proteins, and other members, such as Müllerian inhibiting substance and Lefty (3Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Robert A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, Part I. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 419-472Google Scholar). These factors regulate growth, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and secretion of important molecules, including components of the extracellular matrix, adhesion molecules, hormones, and cytokines in a variety of cell types, affecting morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor suppression, and immunoregulation (3Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Robert A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, Part I. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 419-472Google Scholar). TGF-β signaling is mediated through transmembrane receptors located at the cell surface (TβRs) which are serine/threonine kinases, which in turn use the highly conserved members of the Smad (Sma and MAD-related protein) family of transcription factors to transduce their signals to the nucleus (4Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Two of the receptor-regulated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, transduce signals for TGF-β. Smad4, on the other hand, acts as a heterodimeric partner for Smad2 and Smad3 for efficient DNA binding and transcriptional activation (5Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar, 6Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). When TβRs are activated by the binding of their cognate ligands, Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated by the type I receptor (TβR-I) serine-threonine kinase. Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 then form stable heterocomplexes with Smad4 which translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription. Smad7, one of the inhibitory Smads, stably interacts with activated TβR-I and inhibits TGF-β signaling (7Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M.

Estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand-activated transcriptional factor that is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (10Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). Two types of ERs have been identified, ERα and ERβ, which appear to have overlapping but distinct roles in mediating estrogen action (11Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S.

Estrogens play important roles in the differentiation and development of various organs, maintenance of proper cellular function in a wide variety of tissues, and are also risk factors for breast and endometrial cancer (14Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). ERs interact with estrogen response elements in the target gene promoters and directly regulate their transcription (10Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). In addition, ERs interact with other signaling pathways for which DNA binding may not be necessary (15Sukovich D.A. Mukherjee R. Benfield P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7134-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The development and progression of atherosclerosis is significantly reduced in women, and this may at least in part be the result of reduced accumulation of vascular wall extracellular matrix in response to estrogen action (16Silbiger S. Neugarten J. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 25: 515-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, estrogen administration reduces collagen type IV deposition in the aorta of hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic animals and reduces collagen synthesis by vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro (17Neugarten J. Silbiger S. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 147-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This has also been associated with a slower rate of progression of renal disease in women (16Silbiger S. Neugarten J. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1995; 25: 515-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In this context, the ability of estradiol to suppress mesangial cell collagen synthesis may result in reduced accumulation of collagen after glomerular injury and thereby limit the development of glomerulosclerosis (18Kwan G. Neugarten J. Sherman M. Ding Q. Fotadar U. Lei J. Silbiger S. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). TGF-β, on the other hand, plays an important role in mediating progressive renal injury (19Bruijn J.A. Roos A. de Geus B. de Heer E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 34-47PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of collagen in the glomerular mesangium and renal interstitium contributes to the adverse effects of TGF-β on the progression of chronic renal disease (19Bruijn J.A. Roos A. de Geus B. de Heer E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 34-47PubMed Google Scholar), which is thought to be mediated by stimulation of collagen synthesis in mesangial cells mediated by TGF-β (20Hansch G.M. Wagner C. Burger A. Dong W. Staehler G. Stoeck M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki S. Ebihara I. Tomino Y. Koide H. Exp. Nephrol. 1993; 1: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown previously that estrogens inhibit TGF-β-induced collagen synthesis in renal mesangial cells (22Lei J. Silbiger S. Ziyadeh F.N. Neugarten J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 252-258PubMed Google Scholar, 23Silbiger S. Lei J. Ziyadeh F.N. Neugarten J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 1113-1118PubMed Google Scholar), but how this is achieved is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism by which estrogens inhibit TGF-β function: there are direct physical and functional interactions between Smad3 and ERα. These findings provide insights into the cross-regulation between the estrogen and TGF-β signaling which may have implications for atherosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis as well as other pathological conditions.

Human embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line 293T was maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS and transfected in DMEM containing 1% FCS by the standard calcium precipitation protocol. Human renal mesangial cells were obtained from Clonetics (East Rutherford, NJ) and cultured in MsGM (Clonetics) containing 5% FCS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before stimulation, cells were cultured for 12 h in MsGM containing 1% FCS followed by treatment with TGF-β and/or E2.

MCF-7 cells (2–2.5 × 105 in a 6-cm dish) were transfected by using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assay was performed as described (29Matsuda T. Yamamoto T. Kishi H. Yoshimura A. Muraguchi A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed in 100 μl of PicaGene Reporter Lysis Buffer (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activities. Three or more independent experiments were carried out for each assay. The immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays were performed as described previously (29Matsuda T. Yamamoto T. Kishi H. Yoshimura A. Muraguchi A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin). The immunoprecipitates from cell lysates were resolved on 5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon filter (Millipore; Bedford, MA). The filters were then immunoblotted with each antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 293T cells were maintained as described above. Human renal mesangial cells were maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 12 h of incubation in 1% FCS, human renal mesangial cells were treated with 30 units/ml TGF-β and/or 10−8m E2 for 24 h. Total RNAs were prepared by using Iso-Gen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo) and used in Northern analysis according to the established procedures. A nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and radiolabeled cDNA probes were used, where indicated. To examine the molecular basis of the cross-talk between TGF-β and ER signaling pathways, we performed the transient transfection assay using human embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line 293T. The TGF-β-mediated transcriptional responses were measured by p3TP-LUC, which is one of the standard reporters for assessing TGF-β activity (25Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, a constitutively active form of TGF-β type I receptor, TβR-I(T204D) (25Carcamo J. Zentella A. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used which stimulated p3TP-LUC more effectively than TGF-β plus wild-type TβR-I (31Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). When 293T cells were transfected with p3TP-LUC together with an expression vector for TβR-I(T204D), LUC expression was increased by 5–6-fold (Fig. 1 A). We then examined the effect of estrogens on TGF-β signaling in this model system. 293T cells were transfected with an expression vector for ERα, TβR-I(T204D), and p3TP-LUC and were either left untreated or stimulated with E2. As shown in Fig. 1 A, E2 suppressed TβR-I(T204D)-induced p3TP-LUC activity in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of E2 on TβR-I(T204D)-induced transcriptional activity can be reconstituted in 293T cells similar to those observed in kidney cells, such as mesangial cells. We then assessed the reverse situation for the possible effect of TGF-β signaling on ER activity using the reporter Vit-LUC gene in which two copies of an estrogen response element drive expression of the LUC gene. In the presence of ERα, E2 treatment resulted in a 50-fold increase in Vit-LUC activity (Fig.1 A). Surprisingly, this activation was augmented by TβR-I(T204D) expression in a dose-dependent manner, although TβR-I(T204D) alone did not affect basal reporter activity. These results suggest that in contrast with the inhibitory effects of ERα on TGF-β signaling, activation of the TGF-β pathway has stimulatory roles for estrogen signaling. To examine the cross-talk between TGF-β and ER signaling in greater detail, we used a constitutively active form of ERα, ERα-L536P (26Eng F.C. Lee H.S. Ferrara J. Willson T.M. White J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4644-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with p3TP-LUC, an expression vector for ERα-L536P and/or increasing amounts of an expression vector for TβR-I(T204D), and LUC activities were measured. As shown in Fig. 1 B, TβR-I(T204D)-induced p3TP-LUC activity was inhibited by ERα-L536P in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, expression of TβR-I(T204D) resulted in enhancement of ERα-L536P-induced Vit-LUC activation. These results support the data in Fig. 1 A and clearly show the existence of cross-talk between TGF-β and ER signaling in 293T cells. To assess the specificity of the estrogen effects on TGF-β signaling, we utilized the anti-estrogen tamoxifen, which inhibits E2binding to ERα. p3TP-LUC and TβR-I(T204D) were transfected into 293T cells with an expression vector for ERα, and the cells were either left untreated or treated with E2 in the presence or absence of tamoxifen. The inhibitory effect of ERα in the presence of E2 or ERα-L536P on TGF-β signaling was reversed by tamoxifen (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of E2 on TGF-β signaling in 293T cells is mediated directly by ERα. We next examined if the other major ER isoform, ERβ (11Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4239) Google Scholar, 12Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar), has similar inhibitory effects on TGF-β signaling in an analogous experiment. As shown in Fig. 1 D, TβR-I(T204D)-induced p3TP-LUC activity was inhibited by ERβ in the presence of E2, similar to that observed with ERα, and this inhibitory effect was reversed by tamoxifen. In contrast, ERβ-induced Vit-LUC activation was augmented by TβR-I(T204D), similar to that observed for ERα. These data suggest that both ER isotypes may be involved in the interference of estrogen signaling with the TGF-β pathway. We then examined the cross-talk between TGF-β signaling and retinoic acid, 1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (VDR), glucocorticoid, and androgen receptors in 293T cells because recent studies demonstrated that some members of the steroid receptor family interacted with TGF-β signaling via Smads (31Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 32Song C.Z. Tian X.

However, none of these nuclear receptors had an inhibitory effect on Smad3 activation by TβR-I(T204D) in 293T cells in the presence of their respective ligands (data not shown). These data suggest that inhibition of TGF-β signaling in 293T cells is not a general phenomenon of nuclear receptors but rather is highly specific for ER. We next examined whether the cross-talk between TGF-β and ER signaling is mediated by the Smads, downstream signal transducers of the TGF-β superfamily (4Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). When Smad3 was expressed in 293T cells, p3TP-LUC activity was induced in a dose-dependent fashion, and coexpression of ERα-L536P inhibited this activation (Fig.2 A). Conversely, ERα-L536P-induced Vit-LUC activation was augmented by the expression of Smad3 (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, enhancement of both ERα- and ERα-L536P-induced Vit-LUC activity by TβR-I(T204D) was inhibited by the expression of a dominant negative form of Smad3, Smad3DE (24Nishihara A. Hanai J.-i. Okamoto N. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 B), or an inhibitory Smad, Smad7 (Fig. 2 C). These data suggest that the cross-talk between TGF-β and ER in 293T cells is mediated by Smad3. One of the possible mechanisms that is consistent with the data described above is that there are direct physical interactions between ERα and Smad3. We tested this possibility by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding ERα-L536P or wild-type ERα together with FLAG-tagged Smad3 and TβR-I(T204D), left untreated or treated with E2, and the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then used in Western analysis with an antiserum against ERα. As shown in Fig.3 A, ERα-L536P and Smad3 were found to be in a complex in 293T cells. Consistent with the fact that ERα inhibits TGF-β signaling only in the presence of E2, ERα-Smad3 interactions were only detected in E2-treated cells (Fig. 3 A). We next tested whether TGF-β affects ERα-Smad3 interactions. 293T cells were transfected with ERα-L536P together with FLAG-tagged Smad3 with or without TβR-I(T204D), and immunoprecipitation and Western analysis were carried out as above. As shown in Fig. 3 B, ERα-L536P interacted with Smad3 only in the presence of TβR-I(T204D), suggesting that stimulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway is a prerequisite for ERα-Smad3 interactions. We also tested whether ERs interacted with any of the other Smads. 293T cells were transfected with ERα-L536P or ERβ together with FLAG-tagged Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4 in the presence of TβR-I(T204D). As shown in Fig. 3 C, both ERα and ERβ interacted with all three Smads tested; however, interaction with Smad2 appeared to be weaker compared with that observed with Smad3 or Smad4. These results suggest that multiple Smad members may be involved in the cross-talk between ER and TGF-β signaling. We next determined the domains of Smad3 which mediate interactions with ERα, using either N- or C-terminal deletion mutants of Smad3 (24Nishihara A. Hanai J.-i. Okamoto N. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). Expression vectors encoding ERα-L536P and/or FLAG-tagged full-length Smad3 or one of its four deletion mutants were transiently transfected into 293T cells, together with TβR-I(T204D). Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-ERα antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then used in Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, whereas the full-length Smad3 interacted with ERα-L536P, the C-terminal deletion mutants lacking the MH2 or L+MH2 domains were unable to bind ERα. In contrast, the N-terminal mutants in which MH1 or MH1+L domains are deleted retained interactions with ERα. These results indicate that efficient ERα-Smad3 interactions require the MH2 domain of Smad3. We then tested the Smad3 mutants used in the above analysis for their ability to activate the p3TP-LUC reporter. As shown in Fig.4 C, whereas the full-length Smad3 and the N-terminal deletion mutants increased TβR-I(T204D)-induced p3TP-LUC activation, the C-terminal mutants in which the MH2 is deleted were inactive. These results, consistent with the physical interaction data presented above and previous findings on TGF-β signaling (9Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 36Hata A. Lo R.S. Wotton D. Lagna G. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 388: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), suggest that the MH2 domain is most critical for Smad3 activity. We then determined the domain(s) of Smad3 which is involved in the inhibition of TGF-β signaling by ERα. As shown in Fig.4 C, expression of ERα-L536P significantly reduced p3TP-LUC activation. Expression of full-length Smad3, or its N-terminal deletion mutants, but not the C-terminal deletion mutants lacking the MH2 domain, largely reversed the ERα-mediated inhibition of p3TP-LUC expression. These results suggest that the MH2 domain of Smad3 mediates the inhibition of TGF-β signaling by ERα. It was also of interest to determine whether the stimulatory action of Smad3 on ERα is mediated by the MH2 domain. To that end, the Vit-LUC reporter was transfected into 293T cells with TβR-I(T204D) and ERα with or without Smad3 or its deletion mutants. As shown in Fig.4 D, ERα-mediated activation of Vit-LUC was augmented by TβR-I(T204D) ∼6-fold in the presence of full-length Smad3. Similar levels of activation were observed by TβR-I(T204D) and the N-terminal mutants of Smad3 but not the C-terminal mutants. Consistent with thein vivo interaction data presented above, these results suggest that the MH2 domain of Smad3 is required for the cross-talk between ERα and TGF-β signaling in both directions. To examine the cross-talk between TGF-β and estrogen signaling pathways under more physiological conditions through endogenous proteins, we first utilized a TGF-β-responsive, ER-positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 (30Yamamoto T. Matsuda T. Muraguchi A. Miyazono K. Kawabata K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the transient transfection assay. MCF-7 cells were transfected with p3TP-LUC and treated with TGF-β and/or E2, and LUC activities were determined. As shown in Fig.5 A, TGF-β stimulated p3TP-LUC activity, whereas E2 alone did not have an affect. When cells were treated with both TGF-β and E2, p3TP-LUC activation was decreased by 40–50% compared with the activation by TGF-β alone. In contrast, when MCF-7 cells were transfected with Vit-LUC and treated with TGF-β and/or E2, TGF-β further stimulated E2-induced Vit-LUC activity by 30–40%, similar to that observed in 293T cells (Fig. 1). In parallel with these transfection studies, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using cell lysates obtained from MCF-7 cells that were either left untreated or were treated with TGF-β and E2. Similar to the results obtained in transfected 293T cells (Fig. 3), we found that ERα that was immunoprecipitated from MCF-7 cells was in a complex with Smad3, and this interaction was dependent on the presence of TGF-β and E2 (Fig.5 B). We then examined whether estrogens have similar effects on TGF-β-induced transcriptional activation of endogenous genes. To that end, we first used 293T cells that were transfected with TβR-I/Smad3 to activate the TGF-β pathway. The steady-state mRNA levels of a TGF-β target gene, α2(I)-collagen (COL1A2), which codes for a major structural component of the extracellular matrix (37Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), was determined by Northern analysis in the presence or absence of the constitutively active ER form ERα-P563L. As shown in Fig. 5 C, expression of TβR-I/Smad3 in 293T cells induced endogenous COL1A2 expression by ∼3-fold, and this activation was abolished in the presence of ERα-L536P, suggesting that ERα can directly target TGF-β regulation of endogenous genes. We next performed a similar experiment in renal mesangial cells but without ectopic expression of any factors. Cells were either left untreated or treated with TGF-β and/or E2, andCOL1A2 expression was monitored by Northern analysis. As shown in Fig. 5 D, TGF-β treatment inducedCOL1A2 expression by ∼3.5-fold, and this activation was completely abolished in the presence of E2 (Fig.5 C). These data show that E2 inhibits TGF-β-target gene transcription in renal mesangial cells. Perturbations in the TGF-β signaling have been associated with a variety of clinical disorders including some cancers, renal disease, and vascular disease (3Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Sporn M.B. Robert A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, Part I. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1990: 419-472Google Scholar, 19Bruijn J.A. Roos A. de Geus B. de Heer E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 34-47PubMed Google Scholar, 38de Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar). Although mutations in various components of the TGF-β pathway may account for some of these abnormalities, it has been shown that TGF-β signaling can be strongly affected by interactions with other molecules in the cell. Recent studies have documented the interaction of a large number of intracellular proteins with the effector molecules Smads to influence TGF-β signaling (40Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Whereas some of these proteins have been found to cooperate functionally with and activate Smads, others were found to repress Smad activity. One class of proteins that interact with the TGF-β signaling pathway is the steroid receptor family, which can influence TGF-β signaling both positively and negatively to impact a variety of physiological and pathological processes (22Lei J. Silbiger S. Ziyadeh F.N. Neugarten J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 252-258PubMed Google Scholar, 23Silbiger S. Lei J. Ziyadeh F.N. Neugarten J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 1113-1118PubMed Google Scholar, 41Pierce G.F. Mustoe T.A. Lingelbach J. Masakowski V.R. Gramates P. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1993; 92: 2841-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Smad3 enhanced VDR transcriptional activity by its physical interaction of ligand-induced VDR and the coactivators SRC-1/TIF2 (31Yanagisawa J. Yanagi Y. Masuhiro Y. Suzawa M. Watanabe M. Kashiwagi K. Toriyabe T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato S. Science. 1999; 283: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar); however, the effect of VDRs on Smad3 activity was not assessed. In other studies, androgen receptors were found to stimulate TGF-β signaling via direct binding to Smad3 (33Kang H.Y. Lin H.K. Hu Y.C. Yeh S. Huang K.E. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3018-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas Smad3 repressed androgen receptor-mediated transcription (34Hayes S.A. Zarnegar M. Sharma M. Yang F. Peehl D.M. ten Dijke P. Sun Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2112-2118PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, interaction between glucocorticoid receptors and Smad3 suppressed TGF-β signaling in hepatoma cells, but Smad3 did not affect glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcriptional activation (32Song C.Z. Tian X. Gelehrter T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, there are divergent results in the interaction of individual steroid receptors and TGF-β signaling pathways and the molecular mechanisms that may be involved. In this study, we have shown that ERs suppress TGF-β signaling by associating with, and acting as a transcriptional corepressor for, Smad3. The inhibition of Smad3 activity by ERs provides a molecular mechanism for the opposing effects of estrogens and TGF-β signaling in some disease states, such as renal injury, atherosclerosis, and breast cancer (22Lei J. Silbiger S. Ziyadeh F.N. Neugarten J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 252-258PubMed Google Scholar, 23Silbiger S. Lei J. Ziyadeh F.N. Neugarten J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 1113-1118PubMed Google Scholar). Reversal of the suppression of Smad3 activation by ERα/E2 by the anti-estrogen tamoxifen indicated that this effect is mediated directly by ER; both ERα and ERβ had this activity. These findings are consistent with the reported therapeutic effects of anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, through local boosting of TGF-β signaling (43Benson J.R. Baum M. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 993-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Conversely, ER transcriptional activity was increased by activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is similar to that found for the VDR but opposite of that found for the androgen receptor (34Hayes S.A. Zarnegar M. Sharma M. Yang F. Peehl D.M. ten Dijke P. Sun Z. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2112-2118PubMed Google Scholar), whereas there was no effect of TGF-β signaling on the glucocorticoid receptor (32Song C.Z. Tian X. Gelehrter T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of TGF-β signaling-induced ER activity remains to be established. However, activation of ER by the TGF-β pathway can establish a feedback loop where estrogen signaling would be accentuated by the TGF-β signaling itself which in turn would be inhibited more quickly and effectively. Upon inhibition of the TGF-β signaling, ER activity would return to normal levels again. Further work will be required to assess the possible significance of this two-way cross-talk and the feedback loop that may be established in the pathophysiology of disease states. Several additional molecular mechanisms have been proposed for the inactivation of Smad/TGF-β signaling pathway. For example, TGF-β signaling is inhibited by interferon-γ (44Ulloa L. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1999; 397: 710-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor-α (45Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Bottinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar), which induce the expression of an inhibitory Smad, Smad7. In addition, the zinc finger protein Evi-1 interacts with Smad3 and represses its DNA binding activity (46Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K. Matsuyama T. Takahashi T. Chiba S. Yazaki Y. Matsumoto K. Hirai H. Nature. 1998; 394: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), whereas the nuclear Ski and SnoN oncoproteins have been reported to inhibit TGF-β signaling by recruitment of the transcriptional repressor N-CoR to TGF-β-responsive promoters through interaction with Smad proteins (47Akiyoshi S.

Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Smad2/3 interacts with Ski through its C-terminal MH2 domain in a TGF-β-dependent manner, similar to ERα. Further studies will determine whether any of these mechanisms also plays some role in the ER-mediated repression TGF-β signaling. In this study, we demonstrated that Smads are important regulators of ER function and thereby may have critical roles in the progression of diseases, such as breast cancer or kidney disease. More detailed understanding of the cross-talk between Smads and ER is therefore important because this new information may provide new therapeutic approaches for these and other pathological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2078937761,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), represented by nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B), is believed to form a membrane-associated RNA replication complex together with other nonstructural proteins and as yet unidentified host components. However, the determinants for membrane association of this essential viral enzyme have not been defined. By double label immunofluorescence analyses, NS5B was found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or an ER-like modified compartment both when expressed alone or in the context of the entire HCV polyprotein. The carboxyl-terminal 21 amino acid residues were necessary and sufficient to target NS5B or a heterologous protein to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. This hydrophobic domain is highly conserved among 269 HCV isolates analyzed and predicted to form a transmembrane alpha-helix. Association of NS5B with the ER membrane occurred by a posttranslational mechanism that was ATP-independent. These features define the HCV RdRp as a new member of the tail-anchored protein family, a class of integral membrane proteins that are membrane-targeted posttranslationally via a carboxyl-terminal insertion sequence. Formation of the HCV replication complex, therefore, involves specific determinants for membrane association that represent potential targets for antiviral intervention."

PKR activation requires binding of double-stranded RNA or PACT/RAX proteins to its regulatory domain. Since several reports have demonstrated that translation is inhibited in apoptosis, we investigated whether PKR and eIF2-α phosphorylation contribute to this process. We show that PKR is proteolysed and that eIF2-α is phosphorylated at the early stages of apoptosis induced by various stimuli. Both events coincide with the onset of caspase activity and are prevented by caspase inhibitors. Using site-directed mutagenesis we show that PKR is specifically proteolysed at Asp251 during cellular apoptosis. This site is cleaved in vitro by recombinant caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-8 and not by the proinflammatory caspase-1 and caspase-11. The released kinase domain efficiently phosphorylates eIF2-α at the cognate Ser51 residue, and its overexpression in mammalian cells impairs the translation of its own mRNA and of reporter mRNAs.

Another known cytotoxic synergy, both in vitro and in vivo, is the combined addition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN) (3Lejeune F.J. Ruegg C. Liénard D. Curr. Opin.

PKR is intimately linked with the cellular IFN-inducible antiviral response. Its activation results in host cell protein synthesis shutoff, a powerful countermeasure of the cell against viral infection (7Katze M.G.

Korth M.J. Gale Jr., M. Wambach M. Der S.D. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Williams B.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus PKR0/0 mouse embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis (12Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Conversely, induction of apoptosis by TNF increases phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 2 (eIF2-α) (13Srivastava S.P. Kumar K.U. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The mechanism linking PKR activation to the TNF-signaling pathway leading to programmed cell death is still unclear.PKR is a serine-threonine kinase consisting of two functionally distinct domains: an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (14Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The regulatory domain consists of two dsRNA-binding motifs, followed by a spacer. Binding of dsRNA exposes the catalytic site and induces dimerization of PKR. Dimerization allows autophosphorylation, rendering PKR active (15Galabru J. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15538-15544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Manche L. Green S.R.

Once the enzyme is activated, dsRNA is dispensable for further substrate phosphorylation. Recently, also dsRNA-independent protein activators of PKR, such as PACT (human) and RAX (mouse), have been identified (20Patel R.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4379-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 21Ito T. Yang M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15427-15432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).Activated PKR can phosphorylate eIF2-α. eIF2 forms a ternary complex with the methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet) and GTP. This complex is essential for recruiting Met-tRNAiMet to the 40 S ribosomal subunit and initiating mRNA translation. After delivery of Met-tRNAiMet at the proper AUG initiation codon of an mRNA, eIF2-bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. Subsequent loading of eIF2 with Met-tRNAiMet requires exchange of eIF2-bound GDP by GTP, a reaction catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Phosphorylation of eIF2-α converts eIF2 to a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B, resulting in a general protein synthesis shutdown (22Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 23Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of only a fraction of the cellular eIF2-α is sufficient to severely impair translation initiation, because eIF2B is a limiting component of the cellular translation machinery (24Safer B. Cell. 1983; 33: 7-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Oldfield S. Jones B.L. Tanton D. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 399-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Apoptosis involves ordered activation of cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinases (caspases), giving rise to cleavage of a particular subset of the cellular proteome (26Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar). These cleavage events most often lead to loss of function of the target protein. In a number of cases, however, the substrate becomes activated after cleavage due to removal of regulatory domains (27Utz P.J. Anderson P. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 589-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Since PKR activation by an unknown mechanism has been described downstream of TNF-induced apoptosis (10Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 12Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), we searched for a possible mechanism of PKR activation and consequent phosphorylation of eIF2-α during extrinsic apoptosis by death domain receptor aggregation and during apoptosis by staurosporine (STS), a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor. In both apoptotic pathways phosphorylation of eIF2-α, as well as proteolysis and activation of PKR, occur in a caspase-dependent manner, illustrating the existence of a novel, caspase-dependent mode of PKR activation.DISCUSSIONThe antiviral protein kinase PKR is expressed in many cells, where it is present in a dormant state. The typical mode of activation of PKR requires the presence of dsRNA, a metabolic intermediate of viral infection (40Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that caspase-mediated cleavage of PKR, at the boundary between the regulatory and kinase domain of PKR, liberates an active eIF2-α kinase domain. This cleavage and the increased eIF2-α phosphorylation are general features of apoptosis, triggered by either extrinsic (TNF, anti-Fas) or intrinsic (STS) cell death pathways (Fig.8).Our results suggest that the released kinase domain of PKR is constitutively active, which is well supported by structure-function studies (17Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Zhu S. Romano P.R. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14434-14441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Is this cleavage-dependent mode of activation compatible with the current model of PKR control mechanisms? Given the detrimental impact of PKR activity on protein synthesis and normal cellular function, the kinase is kept in a latent state at two levels. The second dsRNA-binding motifs of PKR interacts intramolecularly with the kinase domain, ensuring a “locked” inactive conformation, and probably masks the dimerization domain (17Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,18Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J.

Virology. 1998; 250: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of the entire PKR molecule has not been determined yet, it seems likely that Asp251, the residue in the PKR peptide sequence targeted by caspases, should be accessible in such a “bent-over” model. In addition, a number of cellular inhibitors have been described that either compete with PKR for dsRNA binding (42Kumar K.U. Srivastava S.P. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or prevent its homodimerization (43Cosentino G.P. Venkatesan S. Serluca F.C. Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 44Tan S.L. Gale Jr., M.J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2431-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Since PKR is a major component of the IFN-mediated antiviral response, it is not surprising that many viruses encode PKR-inhibitory molecules. Some of these prevent PKR activation by interfering with its dsRNA binding,e.g. vaccinia virus E3L and influenza virus NS1, or homo-dimerization and transphosphorylation, e.g. influenza virus and hepatitis C virus (45Gale Jr., M. Katze M.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The caspase-mediated activation of PKR releases the kinase domain from the control of the regulatory amino-terminal domain. This may provide the cell with a bypass mechanism to fight such virally and cellularly encoded PKR inhibitors.Our study highlights the rapid and ordered shut down of protein synthesis during apoptosis. In previous publications the recurrent feature responsible for the observed translation inhibition was cleavage of distinct translation initiation factors by caspases primarily targeting cap-dependent translation. However, the translation of certain mRNAs, coding for several survival factors, oncogenes and proteins involved in controlling apoptosis, is regulated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Proteolysis of eIF4G will most probably lead to inhibition of translation of most mRNAs, but may still allow translation of IRES-containing transcripts (46Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 47Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 48Henis-Korenblit S. Strumpf N.L. Goldstaub D. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2-α prevents recruitment of the methionyl-initiator tRNA to the start codon of small ribosomal subunit-associated mRNAs, a common step in initiation of translation of all mRNAs, including most known IRES-containing RNAs (49Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control and Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar, 50McCarthy J.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R715-R717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).We could not demonstrate complete cleavage of PKR, whereas eIF4G and PARP were eventually entirely processed. Proteolysis of PKR, however, liberates an active catalytical fragment and can be regarded as a gain of function. The final outcome of the enzyme's action is removal from the circulation of eIF2B, a limiting component of the translation initiation pathway. Hence, it is conceivable that even a limited amount of active PKR would in due course have a strong inhibitory impact on translation. By contrast, the aim of cleavage of eIF4G and PARP is loss of a potentially life-saving function. Therefore, abolishment of their respective cap-mRNA recruiting and DNA repair functions would require their complete digestion.Our results as well as other published data suggest that during rapid apoptosis shutdown of protein synthesis occurs at multiple levels and presumably leaves little possibility for any messenger to be translated (46Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 51Nadano D. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13967-13973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cellular in vitro cell systems used by us and others to study the effect of caspases on the translational apparatus may be affected by apoptotic conditions occurring during the development or depletion of activated immune cells. Under such conditions, a more gradual translational shutoff may take place, allowing cell recovery at different levels of the cell death pathway. Such a rescue pathway could be mediated by an IRES-controlled expression of antiapoptotic molecules, e.g. XIAP, c-Myc, eIF4G, Hsp70, and BiP (47Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Translational impairment due to increased eIF2-α phosphorylation has been reported to preferentially allow translation of the proapoptotic molecules Bax and Fas (52Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6888-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). On the other hand, short-lived antiapoptotic proteins (such as cFLIP) were shown to be quickly lost by translation inhibition, unclosing the default cell death pathway (2Fulda S. Meyer E. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3947-3956PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that control of translation plays a major role in the programmed death process.In view of the paradigm that apoptosis is a clean way for a cell to die, inhibition of de novo protein synthesis during the apoptotic process may be important to prevent inadvertent synthesis of proinflammatory molecules (and of any other proteins), once the dying cell has been phagocytosed (53Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 54Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis is essential to sustain life. Inhibition of translation, for example by treatment with cycloheximide (CHX),1 often enhances the induction of apoptosis by different stimuli (1Polunovsky V.A. Wendt C.H. Ingbar D.H. Peterson M.S. Bitterman P.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This sensitization of apoptosis by CHX has been explained by the inhibition of translation-dependent antiapoptotic mechanisms (2Fulda S. Meyer E. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3947-3956PubMed Google Scholar). Another known cytotoxic synergy, both in vitro and in vivo, is the combined addition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN) (3Lejeune F.J. Ruegg C. Liénard D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Tsujimoto M. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2441-2444PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fransen L. Van der Heyden J. Ruysschaert R. Fiers W. Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 1986; 22: 419-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). IFNs are pleiotropic cytokines with antiviral and antiproliferative properties (6Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized proteins induced by IFNs is the dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). PKR is intimately linked with the cellular IFN-inducible antiviral response. Its activation results in host cell protein synthesis shutoff, a powerful countermeasure of the cell against viral infection (7Katze M.G. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 75-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 8Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 129-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, many viruses, which are a prime source of dsRNA, encode PKR-inhibiting molecules. Down-regulation of PKR expression by antisense mRNA in U937 cells protects these cells against TNF-induced apoptosis (10Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and overexpression of the cellular PKR inhibitor-p58IPK renders cells resistant to dsRNA- and TNF-induced apoptosis (11Tang N.M. Korth M.J. Gale Jr., M. Wambach M. Der S.D. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Williams B.R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus PKR0/0 mouse embryonic fibroblasts are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis (12Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Conversely, induction of apoptosis by TNF increases phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 2 (eIF2-α) (13Srivastava S.P. Kumar K.U. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2416-2423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).

The regulatory domain consists of two dsRNA-binding motifs, followed by a spacer. Binding of dsRNA exposes the catalytic site and induces dimerization of PKR.

Apoptosis involves ordered activation of cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinases (caspases), giving rise to cleavage of a particular subset of the cellular proteome (26Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar). These cleavage events most often lead to loss of function of the target protein.

Phosphorylation of eIF2-α prevents recruitment of the methionyl-initiator tRNA to the start codon of small ribosomal subunit-associated mRNAs, a common step in initiation of translation of all mRNAs, including most known IRES-containing RNAs (49Hershey J.W.B.

Proteolysis of PKR, however, liberates an active catalytical fragment and can be regarded as a gain of function. The final outcome of the enzyme's action is removal from the circulation of eIF2B, a limiting component of the translation initiation pathway. Hence, it is conceivable that even a limited amount of active PKR would in due course have a strong inhibitory impact on translation. By contrast, the aim of cleavage of eIF4G and PARP is loss of a potentially life-saving function. Therefore, abolishment of their respective cap-mRNA recruiting and DNA repair functions would require their complete digestion.Our results as well as other published data suggest that during rapid apoptosis shutdown of protein synthesis occurs at multiple levels and presumably leaves little possibility for any messenger to be translated (46Clemens M.J.

The cellular in vitro cell systems used by us and others to study the effect of caspases on the translational apparatus may be affected by apoptotic conditions occurring during the development or depletion of activated immune cells. Under such conditions, a more gradual translational shutoff may take place, allowing cell recovery at different levels of the cell death pathway. Such a rescue pathway could be mediated by an IRES-controlled expression of antiapoptotic molecules, e.g. XIAP, c-Myc, eIF4G, Hsp70, and BiP (47Holcik M. Sonenberg N. Korneluk R.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Translational impairment due to increased eIF2-α phosphorylation has been reported to preferentially allow translation of the proapoptotic molecules Bax and Fas (52Balachandran S. Kim C.N. Yeh W.C. Mak T.W. Bhalla K. Barber G.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6888-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). On the other hand, short-lived antiapoptotic proteins (such as cFLIP) were shown to be quickly lost by translation inhibition, unclosing the default cell death pathway (2Fulda S. Meyer E. Debatin K.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3947-3956PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that control of translation plays a major role in the programmed death process.In view of the paradigm that apoptosis is a clean way for a cell to die, inhibition of de novo protein synthesis during the apoptotic process may be important to prevent inadvertent synthesis of proinflammatory molecules (and of any other proteins), once the dying cell has been phagocytosed (53Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 54Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). The antiviral protein kinase PKR is expressed in many cells, where it is present in a dormant state. The typical mode of activation of PKR requires the presence of dsRNA, a metabolic intermediate of viral infection (40Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that caspase-mediated cleavage of PKR, at the boundary between the regulatory and kinase domain of PKR, liberates an active eIF2-α kinase domain. This cleavage and the increased eIF2-α phosphorylation are general features of apoptosis, triggered by either extrinsic (TNF, anti-Fas) or intrinsic (STS) cell death pathways (Fig.8). Our results suggest that the released kinase domain of PKR is constitutively active, which is well supported by structure-function studies (17Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Zhu S. Romano P.R. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14434-14441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Is this cleavage-dependent mode of activation compatible with the current model of PKR control mechanisms? Given the detrimental impact of PKR activity on protein synthesis and normal cellular function, the kinase is kept in a latent state at two levels. The second dsRNA-binding motifs of PKR interacts intramolecularly with the kinase domain, ensuring a “locked” inactive conformation, and probably masks the dimerization domain (17Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1291-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,18Nanduri S. Rahman F. Williams B.R. Qin J.

Virology. 1998; 250: 302-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of the entire PKR molecule has not been determined yet, it seems likely that Asp251, the residue in the PKR peptide sequence targeted by caspases, should be accessible in such a “bent-over” model. In addition, a number of cellular inhibitors have been described that either compete with PKR for dsRNA binding (42Kumar K.U. Srivastava S.P. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or prevent its homodimerization (43Cosentino G.P. Venkatesan S. Serluca F.C. Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9445-9449Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 44Tan S.L. Gale Jr., M.J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2431-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Since PKR is a major component of the IFN-mediated antiviral response, it is not surprising that many viruses encode PKR-inhibitory molecules. Some of these prevent PKR activation by interfering with its dsRNA binding,e.g. vaccinia virus E3L and influenza virus NS1, or homo-dimerization and transphosphorylation, e.g. influenza virus and hepatitis C virus (45Gale Jr., M. Katze M.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 78: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The caspase-mediated activation of PKR releases the kinase domain from the control of the regulatory amino-terminal domain. This may provide the cell with a bypass mechanism to fight such virally and cellularly encoded PKR inhibitors. Our study highlights the rapid and ordered shut down of protein synthesis during apoptosis. In previous publications the recurrent feature responsible for the observed translation inhibition was cleavage of distinct translation initiation factors by caspases primarily targeting cap-dependent translation. However, the translation of certain mRNAs, coding for several survival factors, oncogenes and proteins involved in controlling apoptosis, is regulated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Proteolysis of eIF4G will most probably lead to inhibition of translation of most mRNAs, but may still allow translation of IRES-containing transcripts (46Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W.

To begin to determine the mechanism of GzmA-induced cell death, we used an inactive form of GzmA to isolate three GzmA-interacting proteins: SET (putative HLA-associated protein II, template-activating factor (TAF)-1β, or I2PP2A), pp32 (putative HLA-associated protein I or I1PP2A), and hsp27 (11Beresford P.J.

More recently, we found that during perforin loading or CTL attack, GzmA targets key nuclear proteins (10Zhang D. Beresford P.J. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It also degrades histone H1 and proteolyzes the tails of the core histones, opening up chromatin to exogenous DNases (13Zhang D. Pasternack M.S. Beresford P.J. Wagner L. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3683-3690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The GzmA substrate SET is ubiquitously expressed and has been identified in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It was initially identified as a translocated gene in acute undifferentiated leukemia, in which the sequence for all but the last 6 amino acids is linked to the nucleoporin can (Nup214), which presumably targets the translocated gene product to the nucleus (14von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). SET is a 277-amino acid 44-kDa acidic protein (calculated pI 3.9–4.1) with a 52-amino acid C-terminal acidic tail (15Vaesen M. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Gotz H. Awni L.A. Cole T. Zimmermann B. Kratzin H.D. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The protein, exclusive of its acidic tail, is highly homologous to evolutionarily conserved nucleosome assembly proteins (NAPs) in yeast, plants, and animals (Xenopus, 97% identity; Drosophila, 63% identity; and Arabidopsis, 42% identity). NAP activity requires the acidic tail (16Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kawase H. Okuwaki M.

The homologous protein TAF-1α, which differs only in the N-terminal 24 amino acids, has markedly reduced NAP activity. SET, but not TAF-1α, facilitates transcription, a function that has been attributed to its postulated ability to reverse nucleosome assembly and to increase DNA accessibility (18Matsumoto K. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Handa H. Hanaoka F. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9645-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SET and other NAP family members physically associate with the p300/cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein family of transcriptional coactivators and with core histones (19Nagata K.

Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). SET may therefore provide a link between transcriptional activators and chromatin (22Shikama N. Chan H.M. Krstic-Demonacos M. Smith L. Lee C.W. Cairns W. La Thangue N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8933-8943Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A 20-kDa protein termed I2PP2A, identified as an intracellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, is identical to the N terminus of SET (24Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Full-length SET, as well as the homologous protein TAF-1α, inhibits protein phosphatase 2A, a phosphatase whose activity is modified during the G2/M transition and in caspase-mediated apoptosis (25Santoro M.F. Annand R.R. Robertson M.M. Peng Y.W. Brady M.J. Mankovich J.A. Hackett M.C. Ghayur T. Walter G. Wong W.W. Giegel D.A. J. Biol.

Phosphatase inhibitory activity is associated with amino acids 25–119 (27Saito S. Miyaji-Yamaguchi M. Shimoyama T. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). pp32 was co-isolated with SET from the cytoplasm by two groups (11Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Like SET, pp32 is ubiquitously expressed, has a C-terminal acidic tail, and inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (28Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although SET has been implicated as a proto-oncogene, pp32 suppresses transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts by a variety of oncogene pairs (29Chen T.H. Brody J.R. Romantsev F.E., Yu, J.G. Kayler A.E. Voneiff E. Kuhajda F.P. Pasternack G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). pp32 has both a canonical nuclear localization signal and leucine-rich motifs for binding to CRM1/exportin-1 for nuclear export (30Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 31Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Therefore, pp32 likely shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Indeed, as for SET, some reports localize it to the nucleus, and others identify it in the cytoplasm. Two groups recently isolated an ∼150–170-kDa nuclear complex containing SET and its homolog TAF-1α together with pp32 and its homolog APRIL (23Seo S. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 32Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This complex inhibits histone acetylation (23Seo S. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and binds to HuR, a protein that stabilizes mRNAs containing AU-rich regions in the 3′-untranslated regions of many proto-oncogene and cytokine mRNAs (32Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We show that GzmA destroys the NAP activity of SET. We also found that SET and pp32 are localized in a 270–420-kDa endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated complex. In a GzmA-dependent manner, the purified SET complex induces single-stranded DNA nicks in isolated nuclei. In fact, the SET complex contains a 25-kDa nuclease that degrades eukaryotic or plasmid DNA. We postulate that this unidentified SET complex DNase is the caspase-independent GzmA-activated DNase (GAAD). Recombinant GzmA, S-AGzmA, pro-GzmA (before enterokinase treatment), and GzmB were produced and purified as previously reported (11Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9285-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Xia Z. Kam C.M. Huang C. Powers J.C. Mandle R.J. Stevens R.L. Lieberman J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Perforin was purified from the rat RNK-16 cell line as described (34Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). SET cDNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with Vent polymerase from a human B cell library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and directionally ligated into pET26b (Novagen) using primers containingBamHI and XhoI restriction sites. pp32 was subcloned from a pET3d vector, a kind gift from Z. Damuni (28Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), into pET30a using BamHI and NcoI restriction sites. GST cDNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from pGEM-2K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using primers containing NotI and XhoI restriction sites and inserted into pET30b(+). Recombinant pp32, SET (rSET), and GST were expressed with C-terminal His6 tags in transfected BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma). Recombinant proteins were purified sequentially over Novagen nickel and Bio-Rad anion-exchange columns. Protein A-purified rabbit anti-N-terminal SET antiserum was produced against amino acids 3–16 as described (35Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2258-2262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse anti-SET monoclonal antibody (supernatant from hybridoma KM1720) was a kind gift from K. Nagata (19Nagata K. Saito S. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Furuya A. Kusano A. Hanai N. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-pp32 monoclonal antibody (RJ1) was derived from fusion of the spleen from a mouse immunized subcutaneously every 3 weeks with 10 μg of recombinant pp32 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant following the method previously described (36Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12694) Google Scholar). The RJ1 antibody was purified from culture supernatants by protein A affinity chromatography. Commercially available antibodies that were used are as follows: mouse monoclonal antibody for marking mitochondria (Calbiochem); rabbit polyclonal antisera to His6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GST (CLONTECH), and calreticulin and hsp27 (Stressgen Biotech Corp.); fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako). rSET (3.6 μm) was incubated for 0–4 h at 30 °C with 125 nm GzmA in 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-18% PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Electrophoresed samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Applied Biosystems), and the desired stained bands were sent to the Tufts Core Facility for N-terminal sequencing. Untreated SET and the reaction products obtained 0, 3, and 6 h after incubation were also analyzed at the Harvard University Mass Spectroscopy Facility. The assay was modified from that previously described (16Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Supercoiled pUC18 plasmid DNA (2.2 μg) was relaxed with 30 units of topoisomerase I (Promega) in 4 μl of assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 60 min. rSET was pretreated in assay buffer without bovine serum albumin at 32 °C for various times with the indicated amounts of GzmA or mock-treated before incubation for 15 min at 37 °C with 1 μg of purified core histones. Relaxed plasmid was added to the rSET/core histone mixture and incubated together for 45 min at 37 °C. Samples (deproteinized by treatment with 0.2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K overnight at 37 °C) were electrophoresed through 1.5% Tris borate/EDTA-agarose gels and visualized by EtBr staining. K562 cell lysates (1010 cell eq in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer) were loaded onto an S-AGzmA column as described (11Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9285-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and eluted with 500 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The concentrated S-AGzmA column eluate was applied in Tris-buffered saline to a Sephacryl 400 gel filtration column (2.5 cm × 1.0 m; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and compared with the elution profile ofAmersham Pharmacia Biotech gel filtration standards. Antibodies preincubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline were added to recombinant proteins (50 μg/ml) or cytosolic lysates (5 × 106cell eq in 20 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer) preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with buffer or 50 μg/ml S-AGzmA. Precipitates from cell lysates or recombinant proteins were washed extensively with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline and boiled in 2× SDS loading buffer before electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose, blots were probed with the indicated antibodies. Cells were loaded as previously described (7Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) with granzymes (1 μm, unless otherwise specified) and sublytic concentrations of perforin. Before lysis, cells were preincubated for 2 min in 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Whole cell lysates were prepared by direct lysis in 2× SDS sample buffer. Cytosolic and nuclear lysates were prepared as previously described (7Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). HeLa or COS cells were grown overnight to subconfluency at 37 °C in 8-well chamber slides coated with rat collagen I (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA). Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Fix-and-Perm kit (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then blocked using permeabilization buffer with 10% goat serum. All antibodies were diluted in permeabilization buffer with 10% goat serum and incubated with the samples at room temperature; washes between steps were with phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were incubated for 2 h, followed by incubation with species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate- or tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Samples were mounted using ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and dried overnight. Images were acquired with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning confocal microscopy system enhanced with a Ti Sapphire Tsunami laser from Spectra-Physics. Staining specificity was verified by showing that staining was abrogated in the presence of recombinant protein or antigenic peptide. Jurkat or HeLa cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and the nuclear pellet (isolated after spinning at 1000 × g) was washed once with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Nuclei (105 cell eq/100 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer) were incubated with an equivalent amount of K562 cytoplasmic lysate, 20 μg of purified SET complex protein, and 1 μm GzmA and/or S-AGzmA. After 4 h at 37 °C, DNA nicking was assessed as described (7Beresford P.J. Xia Z. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Immunity. 1999; 10: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Samples were then washed and assayed by scintillation counting or deproteinized for alkaline gel electrophoresis. Plasmid pcDNA3 (0.5 μg) was incubated in 20 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 48 h with 10 μl of the indicated chromatography fractions before deproteinization and analysis on agarose gels. DNA-PAGE assays were carried out as described (37Rosenthal A.L. Lacks S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 76-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were impregnated with 200 μg of calf thymus DNA. The DNase activity of the electrophoresed samples was assessed after overnight incubation at 4 °C in 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, and 5 mmMgCl2 by EtBr staining to reveal negative bands. As a positive control, DNase I (0.1, 0.02, and 0.001 units/lane) was electrophoresed, and gels were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2. rSET was produced in Escherichia coli with a C-terminal His6 tag. A major rSET band migrating at p45 corresponds to the 44-kDa native cellular protein. Both native and recombinant proteins migrate aberrantly upon SDS-PAGE since their calculated masses are 32 and 34 kDa, respectively. Recombinant p45 reacted with antibodies to an N-terminal peptide (amino acids 3–16) of SET and to His6 (data not shown). A minor band at 34 kDa may represent abnormally folded rSET since it reacted with both antibodies as well. rSET, like cellular SET (11Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9285-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was cleaved by GzmA to a major 25-kDa band (Fig. 1,A and B). Another prominent early cleavage product migrated with apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa. With longer incubation or radiolabeling (data not shown), minor bands could be identified at 22, 18, and 12 kDa. SET degradation was completely inhibited by the GzmA-specific inhibitor Ph-HNCONH-CiTEtOIC (11Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9285-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The N-terminal sequence identified p25 as the N-terminal cleavage fragment of SET. The N-terminal sequences of p22 (VSKKE) and p20 (ELNSN) identified these as further degradation products of p25, cleaved after Lys7 and Lys11, respectively (Fig. 1 C). As expected, p25, p22, and p20 were not recognized by the anti-His6 antibody (data not shown). No stable C-terminal fragment was detected on electrophoresed samples. We therefore turned to mass spectroscopy to identify the dominant GzmA cleavage site. Serial samples analyzed during GzmA digestion showed loss of 34,113-Da singly charged rSET and a commensurate increase in 21,423- and 12,692-Da species. This indicates cleavage after Lys176 in the sequence QTQNK↓ASRKRQ (predicted 21,417-Da N-terminal and 12,683-Da C-terminal fragments). Cleavage at Lys176 disrupts a possible bipartite nuclear localization signal, 168KRSSQTQNKASRKR181. Mass spectroscopy also revealed a transient minor fragment of 19,369 Da, corresponding to the C-terminal fragment after cleavage at Lys119. GzmA did not cleave recombinant pp32 (data not shown), suggesting that pp32 is not a substrate of GzmA. This has been confirmed by lack of pp32 degradation in cells loaded with GzmA or in cells subjected to CTL granule-mediated cytolysis (Fig. 1 D and data not shown). During CTL attack, SET is completely degraded within minutes in a GzmA-specific manner since degradation is completely blocked by the GzmA-specific inhibitor Ph-HNCONH-CiTEtOIC (11Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9285-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). SET fragments, however, are not readily visualized on immunoblots of lysed cells unless special care is taken to inhibit proteolysis prior to Nonidet P-40 lysis. To determine whether the in vitro cleavage site is also used in vivo, we loaded GzmA and perforin into K562 cells and added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride before lysis. Immunoblots of whole cell lysates showed the appearance of a 25-kDa SET fragment, which reacted with the anti-N-terminal peptide antiserum (Fig. 1 D). This finding was confirmed after lymphokine-activated killer cell attack of K562 cells (data not shown). The 25-kDa SET fragment was readily apparent after treatment of K562 cells with GzmA plus perforin, but not with either alone. The cleaved fragment was also not detected after perforin loading of GzmB or inactive forms of GzmA (S-AGzmA or pro-recombinant GzmA) (Fig. 1 E). Therefore, the dominantin vitro cleavage site is likely to be dominant in vivo. SET has been shown to bind histones and to have NAP activity (17Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H.

Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). SET interaction with histones was confirmed by the specific elution of histones from an rSET affinity column (data not shown). We also verified the NAP activity of rSET (Fig.2 A) with the supercoiling assay previously described (17Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H. Ishimi Y. Fujii-Nakata T. Kikuchi A. Nagata K. Gene Cells. 1996; 1: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase-relaxed plasmid was incubated with purified core histones in the presence of increasing concentrations of rSET. Supercoiled plasmid, formed after assembly of histones and DNA into nucleosomes, could be distinguished from relaxed plasmid by its higher mobility after proteinase digestion on agarose gels. In a dose-dependent fashion, rSET facilitated chromatin assembly. The NAP activity of rSET was ATP- and sequence-independent since it could be demonstrated for multiple plasmids with no shared sequence in the absence of ATP (data not shown). Deletion of the acidic tail (amino acids 226–277) largely abrogates the NAP activity of SET and its ability to facilitate transcription (17Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H. Ishimi Y. Fujii-Nakata T. Kikuchi A. Nagata K. Gene Cells. 1996; 1: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether GzmA treatment of rSET disrupts its in vitro NAP activity. Pretreatment of rSET with GzmA inhibited the NAP activity of rSET in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). We previously showed that GzmA cuts small peptides from the core histones in the tail regions, which are not required for nucleosome formation (10Zhang D. Beresford P.J. Greenberg A.H. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5746-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After granzyme A treatment, the apparent molecular mass of the core histones shifted by <1–2 kDa. Although removing tail peptides is not expected to interfere with nucleosome formation (38Allan J. Harborne N. Rau D.C. Gould H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we needed to verify that the loss of NAP activity was not secondary to GzmA cleavage of the histone tails. When GzmA and SET were added without preincubation to relaxed plasmid and core histones, although the core histones were proteolyzed, no loss of NAP activity was evident. However, preincubation of SET with GzmA for 30 min disrupted the NAP activity. Moreover, recombinant fragments of SET that correspond to the N- and C-terminal fragments after GzmA cleavage also have no NAP activity (17Kawase H. Okuwaki M. Miyaji M. Ohba R. Handa H. Ishimi Y. Fujii-Nakata T. Kikuchi A. Nagata K. Gene Cells. 1996; 1: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore, GzmA cleavage disables the NAP function of SET. The repeated co-isolation of pp32 and SET suggests that these proteins may be associated within cells (11Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In healing corneal wounds, keratocytes exhibit a myofibroblastic phenotype in response to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), characterized by expression of α-smooth muscle actin. This study examined proteoglycan and collagen expression by keratocytes in vitro during the TGF-β-induced keratocyte-myofibroblast transition. TGF-β-treated primary bovine keratocytes developed myofibroblastic features, including actin stress fibers anchored to paxillin-containing focal adhesions, cell-associated fibronectin, α5 integrin, and α-smooth muscle actin. Collagen I and III protein and mRNA increased in response to TGF-β. Secretion of [35S]sulfate-labeled keratan sulfate proteoglycans decreased markedly in response to TGF-β. Dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, however, increased in size and abundance. Protein and mRNA transcripts for normal stromal proteoglycans (lumican, keratocan, mimecan, and decorin) all decreased in response to TGF-β, but protein expression and mRNA for biglycan, a proteoglycan present in fibrotic tissue, was markedly up-regulated. These results show that TGF-β in vitroinduces a proteoglycan expression pattern similar to that of corneal scars in vivo. This altered proteoglycan expression occurred coordinately with transdifferentiation of keratocytes to the myofibroblastic phenotype, implicating these cells as the source of fibrotic tissue in nontransparent corneal scars.

Trauma, inflammation, and several chronic pathological conditions lead to disruption of the stromal molecular architecture by the accumulation of a disorganized fibrotic extracellular matrix. This scarring is often associated with loss of corneal transparency and can contribute to permanent loss of vision. The essential role of corneal extracellular matrix in vision has led to an extensive characterization of the molecular components of the stroma of both normal and fibrotic corneas.One specialized feature of the stroma is the composition of the hydrated matrix surrounding the collagen fibrils. This extrafibrillar matrix consists of proteoglycans and glycoproteins and includes a unique class of keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycans. Keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains in the stroma modify three proteins, lumican, keratocan, and mimecan, that in other tissues occur as nonsulfated glycoproteins (1Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L.

The unique abundance and tissue-specific nature of the corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPGs)1 suggests their role in corneal transparency. This hypothesis is supported by the occurrence of corneal opacity in diseases in which corneal keratan sulfate is absent and also in mice lacking lumican expression in which corneal keratan sulfate is reduced (4Chakravarti S.

The lumican knockout mice develop corneal haze at 3–6 months of age, the same period of time during which corneal keratan sulfate accumulates in normal mouse corneas (6Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W.

This characteristic alteration in stromal proteoglycans appears likely to be an important factor in the loss of corneal transparency.Keratocytes are quiescent, neural crest-derived cells that populate the corneal stroma and secrete the molecular components of the stromal extracellular matrix. In healing corneal wounds, keratocytes become activated, migrate to the wound site, and begin mitosis (12Matsuda H. Smelser G.K. Exp. Eye Res. 1973; 16: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In later stages of healing, keratocytes develop F-actin stress fibers containing the muscle protein α-smooth muscle actin (13Jester J.V. Barry P.A. Lind G.J. Petroll W.M. Garana R. Cavanagh H.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 730-743PubMed Google Scholar). These contractile cells, known as myofibroblasts, are hypothesized to be involved in wound closure (14Garana R.M. Petroll W.M. Chen W.T. Herman I.M. Barry P. Andrews P. Cavanagh H.D. Jester J.V. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 3271-3282PubMed Google Scholar). Keratocytes in vitro develop myofibroblastic characteristics in response to exogenous or autocrine TGF-β (15Jester J.V. Barry-Lane P.A. Cavanagh H.D. Petroll W.M. Cornea. 1996; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Masur S.K. Dewal H.S. Dinh T.T. Erenburg I. Petridou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4219-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In vivo, antibodies blocking TGF-β eliminate the presence of myofibroblasts in healing wounds (17Moller-Pedersen T. Cavanagh H.D. Petroll W.M. Jester J.V. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TGF-β plays an important role in the biology of wound healing and may be involved in the secretion of fibrotic tissue.We recently demonstrated that bovine keratocytes maintained in vitro without serum or in reduced mitogen-horse serum, maintain stable secretion of proteoglycans similar to those produced in vivo (18Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell H.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of the cells in fetal bovine serum, however, rapidly reduced the KSPG synthesis by these cultures in a manner similar to that of healing wounds (19Long C.J. Roth M.R. Tasheva E.S.

This earlier study also presented preliminary data suggesting that KSPGs were down-regulated by exposure of keratocytes to TGF-β (19Long C.J. Roth M.R. Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh M. Smit R. Conrad G.W. Funderburgh J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13918-13923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have identified conditions under which bovine keratocytes develop myofibroblastic characteristics in response to TGF-β and examined the proteoglycans secreted during this transition. The results suggest that secretion of proteoglycans characteristic of fibrotic scars is coordinated with the development of a myofibroblastic phenotype as a response to TGF-β.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found that bovine keratocytes respond to TGF-β by the development of extensive F-actin stress fibers terminating at paxillin-containing focal adhesions. The formation of new cytoskeletal elements correlates with accumulation of cell-associated fibronectin and its receptor, α5 integrin. Such a fibronectin matrix and associated cytoskeleton is not observed in keratocytes in quiescent cultures (Fig. 1 A), nor is it characteristic of keratocytes in vivo (13Jester J.V. Barry P.A.

Expression of and interaction with a fibronectin matrix, however, represents a classic marker of the fibroblastic phenotype and is exhibited by most adherent cells in culture as well as by keratocytes that populate healing corneal wounds (13Jester J.V.

Cornea. 1997; 16: 675-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stromal fibronectin accumulation is also observed in human corneas from several chronic pathological conditions as well as in acute healing wounds (29Ljubimov A.V. Burgeson R.E. Butkowski R.J.

Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 809-819PubMed Google Scholar).α-Smooth muscle actin is a protein originally thought to be restricted to muscle cells, and its appearance in fibroblastic cells has given rise to the term “myofibroblast.” Corneal myofibroblasts are contractile and have been suggested to play a role in wound closure (14Garana R.M. Petroll W.M. Chen W.T. Herman I.M. Barry P. Andrews P. Cavanagh H.D. Jester J.V. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 3271-3282PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of α-smooth muscle actin in rabbit keratocytes has been shown to depend on interaction of the fibronectin receptor with its ligand (the amino acid sequence RGD) (33Jester J.V. Huang J. Barry-Lane P.A. Kao W.W. Petroll W.M. Cavanagh H.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1959-1967PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it is thought that the corneal myofibroblast represents a phenotype derived from fibroblasts, not directly from the differentiated keratocytes, which lack cell-associated fibronectin (34Fini M.E. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 529-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Myofibroblastic cells are widely observed in normal and pathological tissue environments, and in lung and liver there is an association of myofibroblastic cell population with tissue fibrosis (35Badid C. Mounier N. Costa A.M. Desmouliere A. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 269-280PubMed Google Scholar, 36Stokes M.B. Holler S. Cui Y. Hudkins K.L. Eitner F. Fogo A. Alpers C.E.

Care Med. 2000; 161: 2066-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In healing corneal wounds, increased collagen deposition is associated with the presence of keratocytes containing α-smooth actin, suggesting that the myofibroblastic phenotype identifies cells responsible for deposition of fibrotic tissue (38Ishizaki M. Zhu G. Haseba T. Shafer S.S. Kao W.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 3320-3328PubMed Google Scholar). Only low level collagen expression is observed in normal adult cornea, but in the late phase of healing wounds, a marked increase in collagen biosynthesis and mRNA pools has been demonstrated (39Cionni R.J. Katakami C. Lavrich J.B. Kao W.W. Curr. Eye Res. 1986; 5: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Type III collagen, not a component of normal stroma, is detected in stromal fibrotic tissue (26Kato T. Nakayasu K. Kanai A. Jpn. J. Ophthalmol. 2000; 44: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,27Power W.J. Kaufman A.H. Merayo-Lloves J. Arrunategui-Correa V. Foster C.S. Curr.

Our demonstration that up-regulation of type I and III collagen expression (Fig. 9) correlates with α-smooth actin accumulation in vitro strengthens the hypothesized link between myofibroblastic cells and fibrotic tissue deposition in the cornea.Numerous earlier reports have documented lack of keratan sulfate biosynthesis by fibroblastic cultures of keratocytes maintained in fetal bovine serum and subcultured by trypsinization (40Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our more recent studies found that keratocytes in serum-free or reduced serum media secrete keratan sulfate for extended periods (18Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell H.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar, 19Long C.J. Roth M.R. Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh M. Smit R. Conrad G.W. Funderburgh J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13918-13923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation induced by basic fibroblast growth factor does not down-regulate keratan sulfate biosynthesis, suggesting that cell division per se is not involved. Our current data show a dramatic and rapid effect of TGF-β on keratan sulfate biosynthesis. Stromal fibroblast cultures both produce and respond to TGF-β in an autocrine fashion (16Masur S.K. Dewal H.S. Dinh T.T. Erenburg I. Petridou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4219-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 41Song Q.H. Singh R.P. Richardson T.P. Nugent M.A. Trinkaus-Randall V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). TGF-β is also present in wounded and pathological corneas (42Vesaluoma M.H. Tervo T.T. J. Refract. Surg. 1998; 14: 447-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considered together, these results suggest that TGF-β may be the primary agent responsible for keratan sulfate loss in fibroblastic cultures and in the cornea during wound healing and inflammation. The loss of keratan sulfate must precede or be independent of myofibroblast formation, because although not all cultures of stromal fibroblasts exhibit α-smooth actin expression, none have been found to express keratan sulfate (16Masur S.K. Dewal H.S. Dinh T.T. Erenburg I. Petridou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4219-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).In the current experiments, exposure to TGF-β caused a moderate decrease in mRNA pools for keratan sulfate-linked proteins and a similar decrease in KSPG core proteins labeled with methionine or detected by immunoblotting. Incorporation of sulfate into keratan sulfate on these proteoglycans, on the other hand, was rapidly and dramatically reduced by TGF-β, resulting in a change in the KS/protein ratio of 10-fold compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1). This result suggests a change in the size and/or sulfation of the KS chains modifying the KSPG proteins. The decrease in KSPG molecular size (Fig. 4) is also consistent with an alteration in the glycosylation of the KSPG proteins. Altered keratan sulfate glycoforms were identified in cultures of stromal fibroblasts (40Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In these cells, lumican, keratocan, and mimecan were modified with oligolactosamine chains of low sulfation (40Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31431-31436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These data suggest that reduction of keratan sulfate biosynthesis comes as a result of changes in glycosyl- or sulfotransferase activity in the keratocytes. A report by Nakazawa et al. (43Nakazawa K. Takahashi I. Yamamoto Y. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) documented loss of N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase activity in chicken keratocytes exposed to serum in vitro, providing a candidate enzyme for this modulation.Dermatan sulfate-linked proteoglycans secreted by keratocytes respond in a reciprocal manner to the keratan sulfate proteoglycans (Fig. 3). Overall, the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate-linked proteins decreased in response to TGF-β, whereas the intact proteoglycans increased in size and sulfation. These results suggest an increase in the length and/or sulfation of the dermatan sulfate chains modifying these proteins. Such alterations in corneal dermatan sulfate have been observed in healing wounds and in human corneas undergoing rejection, suggesting that this response in vitro models fibrosis in vivo (8Cintron C. Gregory J.D. Damle S.P. Kublin C.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1990; 31: 1975-1981PubMed Google Scholar, 9Funderburgh J.L. Chandler J.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Sci. 1991; 32: 1846-1853PubMed Google Scholar). The exact nature of the structural changes in the dermatan sulfate and the enzymes that effect these changes remain to be elucidated.The most marked change in proteoglycan proteins secreted in response to TGF-β was in biglycan. Biglycan is not present in the normal stroma and neither biglycan mRNA nor biglycan protein secretion was detected in untreated cultured keratocytes. Within 24 h of TGF-β treatment, however, biglycan mRNA was detected and protein was detected in 48 h (Figs. 6 and 8). Biglycan transcripts and protein increased during several days of exposure to TGF-β. We previously found biglycan to be markedly increased in the stromas of human corneas with chronic pathological conditions (10Funderburgh J.L. Hevelone N.D. Roth M.R. Funderburgh M.L. Rodrigues M.R. Nirankari V.S. Conrad G.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1957-1964PubMed Google Scholar). The large molecular size of the biglycan secreted by keratocytes in response to TGF-β is similar to a large molecular weight dermatan sulfate proteoglycan observed in healing rabbit corneal wounds (11Hassell J.R. Cintron C. Kublin C. Newsome D.A. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Biglycan accumulation is also associated with fibrosis in lung and hepatic tissues (37Venkatesan N. Ebihara T. Roughley P.J. Ludwig M.S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 2066-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 46Hogemann B. Edel G. Schwarz K. Krech R. Kresse H. Pathol. Res. Pract. 1997; 193: 747-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These data together with our current observations suggest biglycan as a sensitive marker of fibrotic tissue deposition in the stroma.The up-regulation of biglycan in the keratocyte appears to be transcriptional; i.e. biglycan mRNA was not detected in the untreated cells. The biglycan gene promoter is reported to contain TGF-β response elements; however, biglycan transcription does not necessarily respond directly to TGF-β (47Ungefroren H. Krull N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15787-15795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the keratocyte system, we observed that biglycan expression in primary cultures was not altered by TGF-β in the complete absence of serum (data not shown). Consequently, the current experiments were carried out in 1% platelet-poor horse serum, a medium that maintains much of the keratocyte differentiated phenotype (19Long C.J. Roth M.R. Tasheva E.S. Funderburgh M. Smit R. Conrad G.W. Funderburgh J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13918-13923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Rabbit keratocytes do become myofibroblastic in response to TGF-β in serum-free conditions (15Jester J.V. Barry-Lane P.A. Cavanagh H.D. Petroll W.M. Cornea. 1996; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a transition dependent on interaction with extracellular RGD-containing ligands (33Jester J.V. Huang J. Barry-Lane P.A. Kao W.W. Petroll W.M. Cavanagh H.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1959-1967PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the response to TGF-β in both systems appears to require signals in addition to TGF-β. Transparency of the cornea to light is a function of the ultrastructure of the corneal stroma, a tissue composed of multiple lamellae of parallel, highly regular collagen fibrils. Trauma, inflammation, and several chronic pathological conditions lead to disruption of the stromal molecular architecture by the accumulation of a disorganized fibrotic extracellular matrix. This scarring is often associated with loss of corneal transparency and can contribute to permanent loss of vision. The essential role of corneal extracellular matrix in vision has led to an extensive characterization of the molecular components of the stroma of both normal and fibrotic corneas. One specialized feature of the stroma is the composition of the hydrated matrix surrounding the collagen fibrils. This extrafibrillar matrix consists of proteoglycans and glycoproteins and includes a unique class of keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycans. Keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains in the stroma modify three proteins, lumican, keratocan, and mimecan, that in other tissues occur as nonsulfated glycoproteins (1Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L.

The unique abundance and tissue-specific nature of the corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPGs)1 suggests their role in corneal transparency. This hypothesis is supported by the occurrence of corneal opacity in diseases in which corneal keratan sulfate is absent and also in mice lacking lumican expression in which corneal keratan sulfate is reduced (4Chakravarti S.

The lumican knockout mice develop corneal haze at 3–6 months of age, the same period of time during which corneal keratan sulfate accumulates in normal mouse corneas (6Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W.

In corneal scars resulting from trauma or from chronic pathologies, keratan sulfate is reduced and dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans are elevated (7Cintron C. Kublin C.L. Dev. Biol. 1977; 61: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Cintron C. Gregory J.D. Damle S.P. Kublin C.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Biophys. 1983; 222: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This characteristic alteration in stromal proteoglycans appears likely to be an important factor in the loss of corneal transparency. Keratocytes are quiescent, neural crest-derived cells that populate the corneal stroma and secrete the molecular components of the stromal extracellular matrix. In healing corneal wounds, keratocytes become activated, migrate to the wound site, and begin mitosis (12Matsuda H. Smelser G.K. Exp. Eye Res. 1973; 16: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In later stages of healing, keratocytes develop F-actin stress fibers containing the muscle protein α-smooth muscle actin (13Jester J.V. Barry P.A. Lind G.J. Petroll W.M. Garana R. Cavanagh H.D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 730-743PubMed Google Scholar). These contractile cells, known as myofibroblasts, are hypothesized to be involved in wound closure (14Garana R.M. Petroll W.M. Chen W.T. Herman I.M. Barry P. Andrews P. Cavanagh H.D. Jester J.V. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 3271-3282PubMed Google Scholar). Keratocytes in vitro develop myofibroblastic characteristics in response to exogenous or autocrine TGF-β (15Jester J.V. Barry-Lane P.A. Cavanagh H.D. Petroll W.M. Cornea. 1996; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Masur S.K. Dewal H.S. Dinh T.T. Erenburg I. Petridou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4219-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In vivo, antibodies blocking TGF-β eliminate the presence of myofibroblasts in healing wounds (17Moller-Pedersen T. Cavanagh H.D. Petroll W.M. Jester J.V. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TGF-β plays an important role in the biology of wound healing and may be involved in the secretion of fibrotic tissue. We recently demonstrated that bovine keratocytes maintained in vitro without serum or in reduced mitogen-horse serum, maintain stable secretion of proteoglycans similar to those produced in vivo (18Beales M.P. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Hassell H.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1658-1663PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of the cells in fetal bovine serum, however, rapidly reduced the KSPG synthesis by these cultures in a manner similar to that of healing wounds (19Long C.J. Roth M.R. Tasheva E.S.

Expression of OCT1 and OCT2 in Xenopus oocytes increased hemicholinium-3-sensitive choline uptake. In contrast, OCT3 did not mediate choline transport. Estimated Km values for choline in rOCT1-, rOCT2-, and hOCT2-expressing oocytes were 346 ± 50, 441 ± 67, and 102 ± 80 μm, respectively. Membrane potential was the major driving force for choline uptake in rat and human OCT2-expressing oocytes and in intact CP in vitro. Lowering of medium pH (6 versus 7.4) was equally effective at inhibiting choline uptake in CP, suggesting that there might be a non-OCT component of choline uptake that is responsive to an H+ gradient. However, choline efflux from CP was not stimulated by a trans-applied H+ gradient. Choline uptake by CP was Na+-independent with an estimated Km of 183 μm. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detected OCT2 and OCT3, but not OCT1, mRNA expression in CP. Transfection of intact CP with a rOCT2/green fluorescent protein fusion construct resulted in strong apical membrane fluorescence with no detectable signal in the basal and lateral plasma membranes.

However, there is very little de novo synthesis of choline in the brain, and a constant supply from plasma is required (1Crews F.T. Hirata F. Axelrod J. J. Neurochem. 1980; 34: 1491-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Movement of choline across the brain capillary endothelium changes with its concentration in plasma (physiological range of 10–50 μm), whereas the choline concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)1 is tightly controlled (5–7 μm) (2Cornford E.M.

Thus, the balance between plasma choline levels and the net flux of brain choline is an important mechanism for maintaining brain choline homeostasis. It has been postulated that perturbations in this balance may have a role in central cholinergic dysfunctions and that impeding the transepithelial movement of choline from CSF to blood may prove to be an effective therapy (6Koppen A.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C1288-C1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using primary cultures of the choroidal epithelium, found that the characteristics of apical choline uptake in CP cells are strikingly similar to those identified for the renal basolateral organic cation (OC) transport system. Such a reversal of functional polarity is conceivable because the movement of OCs from CSF to blood requires the membrane potential-sensitive entry step to take place across the apical membrane of the cells of the CP. Therefore, we propose that the molecular basis for CP function in the regulation of free choline concentration in CSF might be the expression of organic cation transporter (OCT) family members. Three candidate transporters, OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3, have been cloned recently from a variety of species including rat, mouse, pig, rabbit, and man (12Schweifer N. Barlow D.P. Mamm.

Functionally, all three transporters mediate the entry of small OCs into the cell via a potential dependent, Na+-independent, facilitative diffusion mechanism (13Wu X. Ganapathy M.E. Leibach F.H.

They are polyspecific in that they transport and/or are inhibited by an overlapping set of substrates that includes xenobiotics, drugs, neurotransmitters, and neurotoxins (e.g.tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetramethylammonium (TMA), 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium,N 1-methylnicotinamide (NMN), amphetamine, desipramine, quinine, dopamine, and serotonin). Some differences in substrate affinity between OCT1 and OCT2 have been identified (for review see Refs. 23Koepsell H. Gorboulev V. Arndt P. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and 24Zhang L. Brett C.M. Giacomini K.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 431-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), but information on OCT3 is still limited (14Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Wu X. Wang H. Fei Y. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

The endeavor to identify paralog-specific substrates is further complicated by the fact that there are species differences in both the expression and specificity of these transporters as well as variation in kinetic parameters determined in different cellular systems (Xenopus oocytes versus cultured cells versus intact tissue). For example, when examined in oocytes the affinity of rat OCT1 (rOCT1) for TEA appears much greater than that of rOCT2 (Km = 95 versus393 μm, respectively), but when measured in transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells their affinities are virtually identical (Km = 38 versus 48 μm, respectively) (15Grundemann D.

Thus, despite increased understanding of the individual transporters at the molecular and mechanistic levels, correlations of the functional differences between the OCT paralogs are still tenuous. None-the-less, when expressed in oocytes the rat paralogs exhibit markedly different affinities for TEA with the Kmfor rOCT1 being 95 μm, rOCT2 being 393 μm, and rOCT3 being 2.5 mm (14Kekuda R.

It has also been shown that rOCT1 and rOCT2 are both effectively inhibited by TMA, but rOCT3 is not (14Kekuda R. Prasad P.D. Wu X. Wang H. Fei Y. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

Guanidine could prove to be a substrate with markedly different affinities for rOCT1 (Km = 172 ± 57 μm), rOCT2 (Km = 1,660 ± 670 μm), and rOCT3 (Km = 35 μm); however, the Km value for rOCT3 was determined in transfected HeLa cells and not Xenopus oocytes (14Kekuda R.

However, it was also reported that choline is a good substrate for rOCT1 but is not a substrate for rOCT2 or hOCT3 (31Grundemann D. Liebich G. Kiefer N. Koster S. Schomig E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Additionally, there are varying reports as to whether OCT1, OCT2, and OCT3 are even expressed in brain (15Grundemann D.

Here, we present evidence indicating that OCT2 and OCT3 are expressed in rat CP and that choline uptake by intact rat choroid plexus has all the characteristics of OCT2-mediated transport, suggesting that this carrier plays an important role in central nervous system choline homeostasis. Construction and transport activity of the rOCT2/green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted GFP construct have been described elsewhere (32Sweet D.H.

Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Oocyte isolation procedures and uptake assay were performed as reported previously (22Sweet D.H. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F890-F898PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cihlar T. Lin D. Pritchard J.B. Fuller M.D. Mendel D.B. Sweet D.H. Mol.

Briefly, adult female Xenopus laevis (XenopusOne, Ann Arbor, MI) were cooled, anesthetized with tricaine methanesulfonate, and decapitated. Follicle-free stage V and stage VI oocytes were isolated by treatment with collagenase A and maintained at 18 °C in Barth’s buffer containing 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum. Oocytes were allowed to recover overnight before injection. Capped cRNA for microinjection was synthesized from linearized plasmid DNA using Ambion’s mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Three days after injection with cRNA, oocytes were divided into experimental groups of 6–10 each and incubated at 22 °C for 30 or 60 min in oocyte Ringer 2 (OR-2) containing 75 μm [14C]TEA (4 μCi/ml) or 10 μm [3H]choline (1 μCi/ml) in the absence or presence of inhibitor. For uptake studies done under short-circuiting conditions (external K+ concentration raised to 102.5 mm, a condition previously demonstrated to short-circuit the oocyte membrane potential (15Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar)), there was a corresponding decrease in Na+ concentration from 102.5 to 2.5 mm to maintain the osmotic pressure of the medium. Oocyte radioactivity was measured in disintegrations per min in a Packard 1600TR liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.) with external quench correction. Initially, total RNA was isolated from several freshly collected lateral CP of adult male rats using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Approximately 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 42 °C with 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) in a 25-μl reaction (containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 25 units of RNasin, and 0.5 mm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP). One microliter of the reverse transcription reaction was used as template for subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the rOCT1-, rOCT2-, and rOCT3-specific primers as follows: rOCT1for, 5′-CAGCCAGTGCATGAGGTATG-3′, and rOCT1rev, 5′-TTGGGTAGATGCGGCCAATG-3′; rOCT2for, 5′-TCAGTCAGTAGTGAACGTGG-3′, and rOCT2rev, 5′-GGGTTCTGACCAAGTCCAGG-3′; rOCT3for, 5′-CATCGTCAGCCAGTTTGACC-3′, and rOCT3rev, 5′-CACCCCTGCCACTATATTGC-3′. The following control reactions were also performed: 1) reaction containing the corresponding gene-specific primer set but no RT reaction template; 2) reaction using similarly reverse-transcribed adult rat kidney mRNA; and 3) reaction with total CP RNA. Cycle parameters are as follows: denature at 95 °C for 15 min; followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C denature for 30 s, 60 °C anneal for 30 s, and 72 °C extension for 45 s. Products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Subsequently, lateral CP from ∼100 adult male rats were collected in RNAlater (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) and stored at −80 °C. mRNA was isolated using Dynabeads mRNA Direct Micro Kit (Dynal, Inc., Lake Success, NY). One microgram of CP mRNA was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 37 °C with 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in a 50-μl reaction (containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 units of RNasin, and 1 mm each dNTP). One microliter of the reverse transcription reaction was used as template for PCR as described above. Choroid plexus isolation procedures and uptake assay were performed as described previously (38Pritchard J.B. Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Walden R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33382-33387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) were euthanized with CO2and decapitated. Lateral CP were removed immediately and transferred to ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, (in mm) 118 NaCl, 3 KCl, 0.7 Na2PO4, 18 NaHCO3, 2 urea, 0.8 MgCl2, 1.4 CaCl2, and 12 glucose, pH 7.4), previously gassed with 95% oxygen, 5% CO2. Accumulation of 50 μm [3H]choline (0.1 μCi/ml) was measured in fragments of CP (0.5–1.0 mg) incubated in 1 ml of aCSF in the presence or absence of 200 μm quinine and gently shaken at 37 °C. Media for uptake studies conducted under short-circuiting conditions were iso-osmotically adjusted. It has been shown previously that an increase in external K+concentration from 3 to 30 mm reduces ventricular membrane potential (from −70 to −15 mV) in primary cultures of rat neonatal CP (11Villalobos A.R. Parmelee J.T. Renfro J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1288-C1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the efflux experiments, CP were isolated and preloaded by incubation in aCSF containing 50 μm[3H]choline (0.1 μCi/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C. The CP were rapidly rinsed two times with fresh aCSF and incubated at 22 °C in 2 ml of aCSF, aCSF containing 5 mm TMA, or aCSF adjusted to pH 6.0. Duplicate medium samples (25 μl) were removed at the times indicated. Total [3H]choline CP content was calculated by summing all of the counts removed by medium sampling during the experiment and the counts remaining in the CP. In the low Na+ experiments, Na+ in the aCSF was iso-osmotically replaced with N-methylglucamine, and CP were preincubated in treatment buffer for 30 min. Isolated CP were transfected with 0.5–1 μg of plasmid DNA using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) in glass-bottomed confocal chambers (∼4.9 cm2) with a total volume of 2 ml of Eagle’s modified essential medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin). Tissue was incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air for the remainder of the experiment. CP were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy ∼24 and 48 h after transfection. CP and cultured cells were imaged using a Zeiss model 410 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope fitted with a 40× water immersion objective (NA 1.2). Fluorescent images were collected by illuminating samples with an Argon-Krypton laser at 488 nm. A 510 nm dichroic filter was positioned in the light path, and a 515 nm long pass emission filter was positioned in front of the detector. Confocal images (512 × 512 × 8 bits) were acquired as single 8- or 16-s scans and saved to a disc. Figures were assembled with Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software. [14C]TEA (53 mCi/mmol) and [3H]choline (80 mCi/mmol) were obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Unlabeled TEA, TMA, choline, and quinine were obtained from Sigma. The fluorescent plasma membrane-specific marker N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridiniumdibromide (FM 4-64) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were of the highest grade available. Oocytes expressing rOCT1, rOCT2, and hOCT2 exhibited substantial choline uptake that was completely blocked by the organic cation transport inhibitor quinine and by the prototypical choline transport inhibitor hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) (Fig.1 A). In contrast, increased choline uptake was not observed in rOCT3-expressing oocytes (Fig. 1 A) despite the presence of functional transporters, as evidenced by a 70-fold increase in quinine-sensitive TEA uptake (data not shown). The murine OCT3 ortholog also failed to transport choline (data not shown). Furthermore, choline uptake mediated by rOCT1 and rOCT2 was relatively insensitive to nicotinamide, an effective modulator of brain choline levels (Fig.1 B). Time course experiments for both 100 μm and 1 mm [3H]choline indicated that choline uptake was linear for at least 90 min in OCT1- and OCT2-expressing Xenopus oocytes (data not shown); therefore, 30-min uptake was used to approximate the initial rate for kinetic measurements. Water-injected oocytes exhibited no mediated transport. cRNA-injected oocytes were incubated in buffer containing 0.05–2 mmcholine, and uptake was determined (Fig.2). Transport in the presence of 200 μm quinine was also determined at 0.05, 0.2, and 1 mm choline concentrations as a measure of the diffusive (linear) component of uptake (Fig. 2). This component was subtracted from total uptake to yield the mediated component. Double-reciprocal analysis of the mediated component yielded a mean Km(±S.E.) for choline of 346 ± 50 μm for rOCT1 and 441 ± 67 μm for rOCT2 (Fig.2). A choline Km value for hOCT2 of 102 ± 80 μm was also found (data not shown). These values are similar to respective reported values for the transporters (17Gorboulev V. Ulzheimer J.C. Akhoundova A.

Uptake mediated by hOCT2 was further characterized to determine whether its driving force and transport characteristics were like those documented for rOCT2 (22Sweet D.H. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F890-F898PubMed Google Scholar). hOCT2-mediated TEA uptake (Fig.3) was markedly reduced by 200 μm quinine, 5 mm NMN, 1 mmcholine, and 200 μm tetrapentylammonium as established previously for rOCT2 (22Sweet D.H. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F890-F898PubMed Google Scholar). 2D H. Sweet and J. B. Pritchard, unpublished observations. Choline uptake via hOCT2 exhibited a similar inhibition profile, with 1 mm TEA replacing choline as an inhibitor (Fig. 3). Additionally, choline uptake mediated by the rat and human OCT2 orthologs was significantly reduced by short-circuiting the oocyte membrane potential (102.5 mm K+ + 10 μm valinomycin), as demonstrated previously for TEA transport mediated by rOCT2 (Fig. 4) (22Sweet D.H. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F890-F898PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 4Effect of membrane depolarization on OCT2-mediated choline uptake. A 60-min uptake assay with 10 μm [3H]choline was performed on oocytes 3 days after injection with rOCT2 cRNA, hOCT2 cRNA, or water (control). Oocytes injected with cRNA supported a high degree of inhibitor-sensitive choline uptake that was reduced significantly when the oocyte membrane potential was short-circuited (102.5 mm K+ + 10 μm valinomycin). There was no effect on water-injected oocytes. The experiments were repeated in 2 animals, and the data shown are mean values ± S.E. from representative animals (6–10 oocytes/treatment/animal).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether OCT1, OCT2, and/or OCT3 are expressed in CP, mRNA or total RNA was isolated, in independent preparations, from plexus tissue and used as template for reverse transcription. Subsequent PCRs were performed with rOCT1-, rOCT2-, and rOCT3-specific primers using 1 μl of the CP-RT reactions as template. PCR products were detected for rOCT2 (569 bp) and rOCT3 (841 bp) providing direct evidence that these genes are expressed in CP and may play a role in choline clearance from CSF (Fig. 5). No PCR product was detected for rOCT1 (962 bp) in CP. Identical results were obtained for each CP preparation. Positive control reactions with adult rat kidney yielded the expected products for all three genes (Fig. 5). The rOCT2 choroid plexus RT-PCR product was sequenced and found to be identical to rOCT2 cloned from rat kidney (18Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 20Walsh R.C. Sweet D.H. Hall L.A. Pritchard J.B. FASEB J. 1996; 10: A127Google Scholar). We next examined whether the driving forces for choline uptake by intact CP in vitrowere the same as those utilized by these OCT family members (Fig.6). Isolated CP supported substantial choline uptake that was completely inhibited by quinine (Fig.6 A). This uptake was largely potential-sensitive as demonstrated by the reduction in the tissue/medium ratio from 14 to 5 when the concentration of potassium in the transport buffer was raised to 102.5 mm (Fig. 6 A). CP choline transport was also markedly pH-sensitive, being reduced to background level by lowering buffer pH from 7.4 to 6.0 (Fig. 6 B). To determine whether this pH-dependent decrease was due to OC/H+ exchange, we examined [3H]choline efflux from preloaded CP tissue (Fig. 7). Excess external H+ failed to trans-stimulate choline exit, even at >20-fold increased external H+ (pH 6.0 versus pH 7.4). As a positive control, the effect of external TMA on choline efflux was examined because TMA is known to trans-stimulate rOCT2-mediated efflux (22Sweet D.H. Pritchard J.B. Am. J"
https://openalex.org/W2067450415,"Neural progenitor cells (NPC) can proliferate, differentiate into neurons or glial cells, or undergo a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Although death of NPC occurs during development of the nervous system and in the adult, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that nitric oxide (NO) can induce death of C17.2 NPC by a mechanism requiring activation of p38 MAP kinase, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and caspase-3. Nitric oxide causes release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and Bcl-2 protects the neural progenitor cells against nitric oxide-induced death, consistent with a pivotal role for mitochondrial changes in controlling the cell death process. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by SB203580 abolished NO-induced cell death, cytochrome crelease, and activation of caspase-3, indicating that p38 activation serves as an upstream mediator in the cell death process. The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 protected NPC against nitric oxide-induced apoptosis and suppressed activation of p38 MAP kinase. The ability of nitric oxide to trigger death of NPC by a mechanism involving p38 MAP kinase suggests that this diffusible gas may regulate NPC fate in physiological and pathological settings in which NO is produced. Neural progenitor cells (NPC) can proliferate, differentiate into neurons or glial cells, or undergo a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Although death of NPC occurs during development of the nervous system and in the adult, the underlying mechanisms are unknown.

Roth K.A. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 291-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Populations of NPC are also present in certain regions of adult mammalian nervous systems where they are believed to serve as cellular reservoirs to replace neurons and glia that die during aging or as the result of tissue injury (2Morshead C.M. Craig C.G. van der Kooy D. Development. 1998; 125: 2251-2261PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gage F.H. Science. 2000; 287: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control the proliferation and differentiation of NPC (neurogenesis) are beginning to be identified and include neurotrophic factor and cytokine signaling pathways. For example, epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor promote the self-renewal of various primary and immortalized NPC (4Kitchens D.L. Snyder E.Y. Gottlieb D.I. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and Notch and Numb signaling may play widespread roles in controlling neural stem cell fate (5Artavanis-Tsakonis S.

In contrast to the rapidly accumulating data on signaling mechanisms that regulate differentiation of NPC, very little is known of the signals that determine whether NPC live or die. This is despite the fact that considerable death of NPC occurs during development of the nervous system (1Kuan C.Y. Roth K.A. Flavell R.A. Rakic P.

Nitric oxide (NO) is an intra- and intercellular signaling molecule which plays important roles in regulating synaptic plasticity and cell survival in the adult nervous system in both physiological and pathological settings (17Holscher C.

Roles for NO in the development of the nervous system are suggested from studies showing that NO can regulate neurite outgrowth (19Phung Y.T. Bekker J.M. Hallmark O.G. Black S.M. Mol.

Interestingly, NO can also induce apoptosis of a variety of types of cultured cells including neurons (23Leist M. Volbracht C. Kuhnle S. Fava E. Ferrando-May E. Nicotera P. Mol.

As evidence, nNOS-deficient mice exhibit significant protection against cerebral ischemia (28Huang Z. Huang P.L. Panahian N. Dalkara T. Fishman M.C.

The cytotoxic effects of NO may result from its interaction with the superoxide anion to form peroxynitrite and other reactive oxygen radicals (29Dawson V.L. Kizushi V.M. Huang P.L. Snyder S.H.

Oxidative damage to cellular proteins and nucleic acids can, in turn, trigger an apoptotic cascade involving activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), mitochondrial membrane permeability transition, and release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspases that execute the cell death process (25Uehara T.

Several different protein kinases have been reported to act at one or more steps in the apoptotic pathway, with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase being two prominent examples (44Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 2019-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 46Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that p38 MAP kinase can induce translocation of the proapoptotic protein Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria in mature neurons undergoing NO-induced apoptosis (47Ghatan S. Larner S. Kinoshita Y. Hetman M. Patel L. Xia Z. Youle R.J. Morrison R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Although NO is a prominent messenger in the brain, its effects on NPC are unknown. To determine whether NO regulates NPC survival or death and to explore the underlying mechanisms, we examined the effects of NO on C17.2 cells, a clonal line of NPC that can differentiate into neurons or glia when co-cultured with primary neurons or transplanted into the adult rodent brain (48Snyder E.Y. Deitcher D.L. Walsh C. Arnold-Aldea S. Hartwieg E.A. Cepko C.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 33-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 49Snyder E.Y. Yoon C. Flax J.D. Macklis J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11663-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that NO can induce apoptotic death of NPC by a p38 MAP kinase- dependent mechanism: p38 MAP kinase acts at early step prior to dysfunction of mitochondria and caspase activation, and overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly attenuates the activation of p38 MAP kinase and protects the NPC against NO-induced death. These findings suggest roles for NO in regulating NPC fate in physiological and pathological settings. The C17.2 NPC line (a generous gift from C. Cepko) was maintained in plastic culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. For experimental analyses, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated culture dishes or glass coverslips. Experimental treatments included: sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 3-aminobenzamide (Sigma) which were prepared as 200–500 × stocks in culture medium; zVAD-fmk (Biomol Research Labs, Inc.) and SB 203580 (Sigma), which were prepared as 500 × stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide. Treatments were administered by direct dilution into the culture medium, and an equivalent volume of vehicle was added to control cultures. After exposure to experimental treatments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then washed with PBS. Cells were then either stained with the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33258 (5 μg/ml in PBS for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C) or membranes were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and the cells were stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml for 10 min at room temperature). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and examined under epifluorescence illumination using a ×40 objective lens. Cells were considered “apoptotic” if their nuclear chromatin was condensed or fragmented, whereas cells were considered viable if their chromatin was diffuse and evenly distributed throughout the nucleus. In preliminary studies we determined the integrity of the plasma membrane by staining cells with the dye trypan blue. Essentially no cells were stained with trypan blue (data not shown), indicating that the cells with condensed and fragmented nuclei have intact membranes and were therefore not undergoing necrosis. After experimental treatment the cells (∼2 × 106 cells) were solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and the protein concentration in each sample was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Proteins (50 μg of protein per lane) were then resolved on 7.5–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk in TBST (Tris-HCl based buffer with 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.5), and then incubated for 2 h in the presence of primary antibody. Cells were then incubated for 1 h in the presence of a 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibody (IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Reaction product was visualized using an Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom). The primary antibodies included anti-PARP (mouse, 1:1000, PharMingen, San Diego, CA), anti-caspase-3 (rabbit, 1:1000, PharMingen), anti-tubulin (mouse, 1:5000, Sigma), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (mouse, 1:1000, New England Biolabs), and anti-p44/42 MAP kinase (rabbit, 1:1000, New England Biolabs), anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (mouse, 1:1000), anti-p38 MAP kinase (rabbit, 1:1000, Cell Signaling, Inc.), anti-phospho-JNK (mouse, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-JNK (rabbit, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Bcl-2 (rabbit, 1:1000, StressGen, Inc.), and anti-cytochromec (mouse, 1:1000, PharMingen). Caspase-3 activity was assessed by two methods. First, the extent of cleavage of procaspase-3 into the truncated active caspase-3 fragments, and the extent of cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP, was determined by immunoblot analysis. Second, to localize activated caspase-3 in situ, a protocol that employs biotinylated DEVD, a pseudosubstrate and inhibitor of caspase-3 was used (50Mattson M.P. Partin J. Begley J.G. Brain Res. 1998; 807: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). At designated time points following exposure of cells to experimental treatments, they were exposed for 10 min to Locke's buffer containing 0.01% digitonin. Cells were then incubated for 20 min in the presence of 10 μg/ml DEVD-biotin (Calbiochem), washed three times with PBS, and fixed for 30 min in a cold solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were incubated for 5 min in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, followed by a 30-min incubation in PBS containing 5 μg/ml Oregon Green streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cells were then washed twice with PBS and images of fluorescence corresponding to conjugates of activated caspase-3 with DEVD-biotin were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss CSLM 510, Germany) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm. Two methods were used to determine the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria. The first method involved confocal imaging of cells double-labeled with Mitotracker Red CMX Ros (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and a cytochrome c antibody. After experimental treatment, cells were incubated with 100 nm Mitotracker Red CMX Ros for 30 min at 37 °C (the dye is taken up by mitochondria where it forms thiol conjugates with peptides and is thereby trapped in the mitochondria), washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4 °C, followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature in blocking solution (2% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH = 7.4) containing primary monoclonal cytochromec antibody (10 μg/ml, PharMingen, San Diego, CA). After washing, cells were incubated for 2 h in PBS containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, ImmunoResearch Laboratory). Cells were then imaged in dual-scan mode on a Zeiss CLSM 510 confocal microscope using a ×40 water immersion objective (N.A. = 1.4). The excitation and emission wavelengths for Mitotracker CMX Ros were 510 and 590 nm, respectively, and for fluorescein isothiocyanate were 488 and 510 nm, respectively. The second method involved immunoblot analysis of cytochrome cin cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of cells. At designated time points following exposure to experimental treatments, cells (∼1 × 107) were trypsinized and then washed with ice-cold buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.4). Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A and carefully homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were separated into cytosol (supernatant) and mitochondrial fractions (pellet) by differential centrifugation. Cytosolic (300 μg) and mitochondrial (50 μg) proteins were then subjected to immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal cytochrome c antibody as described above. Two expression plasmids were employed for transient transfections: the pBabe Puro vector (5.1 kilobase) contained the complete coding sequence of human Bcl-2 cDNA (a generous gift from D. Bredesen) and the pEGFT-N1 plasmid contained the green fluorescence protein (GFP) cDNA (CLONTECH). Cells were transfected with 5 μg of pBabe-Puro-Bcl-2 plasmid or co-transfected with 5 μg of pEGFP-N1 plasmid using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Experiments were performed 24 h after transfection. To determine the possible involvement of NO in the regulation of NPC survival, we exposed C17.2 cells to increasing concentrations of the NO donor SNP and quantified the percentage of cells exhibiting apoptotic morphological alterations and nuclear chromatin condensation/fragmentation (Fig.1 A). Essentially no cell death occurred in control cultures or cultures exposed to 50 μmSNP (Fig. 1 B). However, at concentrations from 100 to 400 μm SNP induced cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner such that ∼50 and 70% of the cells were killed within 10 h of exposure to 200 μm and 500 μm SNP, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Essentially all cells with apoptotic morphologies excluded trypan blue indicating that their plasma membranes were intact and that they were therefore not necrotic (data not shown). We next assessed caspase activity levels by performing immunoblot analyses of lysates from cells that had been exposed to SNP for increasing time periods. The blots were probed using antibodies against caspase-3 and the capsase-3 substrate, PARP. SNP induced cleavage of procaspase-3 into the active form of caspase-3, with cleavage of procaspase-3 occurring within 4 h of exposure to SNP (Fig.2 A). When cells were treated with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, cleavage of procaspase-3 was largely prevented (Fig. 2 A). SNP also induced PARP cleavage which was evident within 4 h (Fig. 2 C). To further examine caspase-3 activity, we exposed cells to SNP for 4, 7, or 10 h and then processed the cells for in situlocalization of activated caspase-3 using a previously described protocol in which DEVD-biotin is introduced into cells and then detected with fluorescein-tagged avidin. Levels of activated caspase-3 were markedly increased in cells within 4 h of exposure to SNP and remained elevated at 7 h (Fig. 2 B). The activated caspase-3 was localized mainly to cytoplasmic compartments at the 4-h time point, but was also present in the nucleus at the 7-h time point. Treatment of cells with zVAD-fmk largely prevented SNP-induced caspase-3 activation. Recent studies have established a mechanism for activation of caspase-3 that involves mitochondrial alterations that result in release of cytochrome c into the cytosol where it forms a complex with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 resulting in caspase-9 activation which then cleaves and activates caspase-3 (51Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). To determine whether NO induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria in NPC, we performed double labeling confocal fluorescence imaging using the mitochondrial marker dye Mitotracker red in combination with immunostaining with an antibody against cytochromec. In untreated control cells, cytochrome cimmunoreactivity was co-localized with Mitotracker red fluorescence indicating that the cytochrome c was confined to mitochondria (Fig. 3 A). After exposure to SNP, many cells exhibited cytochrome cimmunoreactivity diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and a decrease in mitochondria-associated cytochrome cimmunoreactivity indicating that cytochrome c was released from mitochondria (Fig. 3 A). Whereas no cells (zero of 1000 cells examined in three separate cultures) exhibited this cytochromec release pattern in control cultures, 29 + 5% of the cells exhibited cytochrome c release in cultures that had been exposed for 4 h to 200 μm SNP. We next isolated mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from control and SNP-treated cells and performed immunoblot analyses to determine the relative content of cytochrome c in mitochondria versusthe cytoplasm. In the absence of SNP, cytochrome c was present at high levels in the mitochondrial fraction and was not detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 B). SNP caused a progressive decrease in the amount of cytochrome c present in the mitochondrial fraction, and a corresponding increase in the amount of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction (Fig.3 B). Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases function in a variety of signal transduction pathways and play important roles in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and programmed cell death. Members of the MAP kinase family include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK-1 or p42 MAP kinase; and ERK-2 or p44 MAP kinase), JNK, and p38 MAP kinase (52Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). ERKs are typically activated by growth factor stimulation whereas JNK and p38 MAP kinases are strongly activated by a variety of cellular stresses including ultraviolet radiation, hyperosmolarity, heat shock, and proinflammatory cytokines. p38 MAP kinase and JNK have recently been shown to be involved in cell death induced by nerve growth factor deprivation in a neuronal cell line (53Rosini P. De Chiara G. Lucibello M. Garaci E. Cozzolino F. Torcia M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, p38 MAP kinase and JNK activities are also implicated in developmental neuronal cell death, and in cell death associated with axotomy (54Xia Z. Dickens M. Raigeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Kikuchi M. Tenneti L. Lipton S.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5037-5044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether one or more of these kinases was phosphorylated and activated in response to NO in NPC. Exposure of cells to SNP resulted in a marked (∼5-fold) increase in the level of phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase within 1 h with a further increase in phospho-p38 MAP kinase levels by 4 h; the increase in phospho-p38 MAP kinase occurred without a change in the overall level of p38 MAP kinase protein during the 4-h period of exposure to SNP (Fig. 4). In contrast, SNP treatment did not affect phosphorylation of JNK, ERK-1, or ERK-2 during a 4-h exposure period (Fig. 4). In an additional experiment in which cells were treated for 12 h with SNP, increased phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was evident, whereas there was no change in the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK-1, and ERK-2 (data not shown). To determine whether caspase activation, PARP activity, and/or p38 MAP kinase activation are required for NO-induced death of NPC, we pretreated cells with a cell-permeant caspase inhibitor (zVAD-fmk), an inhibitor of PARP (3-aminobenzamide) (56Didier C.

Preliminary studies showed that none of the three inhibitors affected cell viability under basal culture conditions (data not shown). Cell death caused by SNP was significantly attenuated in cells pretreated with zVAD-fmk, 3-aminobenzamide, and SB 203580 (Fig.5). At a dose of 500 μm SNP that killed 50% of the cells within 7 h, ∼25% of the cells were killed in the presence of zVAD-fmk or 3-aminobenzamide, and only 15% of the cells were killed in the presence of SB 203580. A combined treatment with zVAD-fmk and 3-aminobenzamide provided no additional protection beyond that obtained with either compound alone, whereas a combined treatment with zVAD-fmk and SB 203580 resulted in additive protection such that only 6% of the cells were killed (Fig. 5). Cell death was prevented, and not just delayed, as the high level of survival was maintained beyond 24 h in the presence of both SB203580 and zVAD-fmk (data not shown). These data suggest that PARP, p38 MAP kinase, and caspases each play essential roles in NO-mediated death of NPC. The data to this point demonstrated a requirement for p38 MAP kinase in nitric oxide-mediated death of NPC, but did not establish where in the apoptotic cascade p38 MAP kinase acted. To determine whether p38 MAP kinase activation is required for mitochondrial events in the cell death cascade we pretreated NPC with SB203580 or vehicle, exposed the cells to SNP for 7 h, and then examined levels of mitochondrial and cytosolic cytochrome c by immunoblot analysis. SNP induced cytochromec release in cell pretreated with vehicle, but caused little or no cytochrome c release in cells pretreated with SB203580 (Fig. 6 A). SB203580 also prevented activation of caspase-3 in NPC exposed to SNP (Fig. 6,B and C). These data indicate that p38 MAP kinase acts at a premitochondrial step in the apoptotic cascade triggered by NO. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that can prevent cell death by suppressing oxyradical-mediated membrane damage, stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential, and preventing release of cytochromec (59Desagher S.

In particular, the yeast Mediator complex is required for diverse aspects of transcriptional regulation, including activated transcription and transcriptional repression (7Covitz P.A. Song W.

In addition, Mediator improves the efficiency of basal transcription and the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of pol II (Rpb1) (6Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). To accommodate these diverse activities, the Mediator complex is composed of more than 20 polypeptides, including Srb subunits (Srb2, -4, -5, -6, and -7), Med subunits (Med1, -2, -4, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, and -11), and several transcriptional coregulator subunits (Gal11, Rgr1, Sin4, Hrs1, and Rox3) (10Han S.J.

In addition, one form of Mediator contains additional subunits (Srb8–11) that are involved in transcriptional repression (18Hengartner C.J. Thompson C.M. Zhang J. Chao D.M. Liao S.M. Koleske A.J.

Genetic and biochemical studies have suggested that the Mediator complex can be divided into two subcomplexes, the Rgr1 and Srb4 subcomplexes (13Lee Y.C. Min S. Gim B.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Rgr1 subcomplex contains more than 9 polypeptides, including many genetically identified coregulator proteins. Among them, Gal11, Sin4, Hrs1, and Med2 have similar mutant phenotypes and form a distinct module, termed the Gal11 module, which binds to the C-terminal region of the Rgr1 (14Li Y. Bjorklund S. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10864-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Jiang Y.W. Dohrmann P.R. Stillman D.J.

The pol II holoenzyme (h-pol II) isolated from a gal11 null mutant is devoid of the entire Gal11 module, and is functionally defective for activated, but not basal transcription (21Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Park J.M. Kim H.S. Han S.J. Hwang M.S. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8709-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In vitrobinding assays have identified the Gal11 module as the activator binding target of the Mediator complex. These results suggest that the Gal11 module is required for efficient recruitment of h-pol II to a promoter via activator-specific interaction during transcriptional activation. The Srb4 subcomplex is composed of proteins known to interact genetically with pol II. In vitro reconstitution experiments have shown that Srb2, Srb5, Srb6, and Med6 associate with Srb4, which plays a role as a scaffold in complex formation (23Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 24Lee T.I. Wyrick J.J. Koh S.S. Jennings E.G. Gadbois E.L. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4455-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Genetic and genome-wide expression analyses showed that Srb4 and its associated proteins are generally required for pol II transcription, thus suggesting that the function of Srb4 is to modulate the basic activities of pol II (25Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The modular structure of the Mediator complex has also been shown by electron crystal analysis of the complex. This analysis revealed that Mediator consists of distinct head, middle, and tail domains. The head and tail domains appear to correspond to the Srb4 subcomplex and the Gal11 module, respectively. It was also shown that both the middle and the head domains make contact with pol II, suggesting that there may be multiple contact points between polymerase and Mediator (26Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27Dotson M.R. Yuan C.X. Roeder R.G. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Jiang Y.W. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14307-14310Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Despite progress in the structural and functional analysis of yeast Mediator complex, many parts of its structural architecture, and the functions associated with each part, are not yet understood. For example, the Gal11 module is recognized as an activator-binding module with the function of receiving signals from activators (22Park J.M. Kim H.S. Han S.J. Hwang M.S. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8709-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Whether the remaining polypeptides of the Rgr1 subcomplex form another modular structure with a specific function remains to be determined. In addition, the biochemical function of the Srb4 subcomplex and the points of contact where Mediator binds to GTFs and pol II are still unknown. To decipher the interactions among the various components, we generated recombinant baculoviruses for each of the Mediator subunit polypeptides and performed in vitro reconstitution experiments. Based on these results, we deduced the modular structure of the Mediator complex. Here we show the physical interactions among the Mediator subunits and basal transcription factors. These interactions underlie the transfer of regulatory signals from activator proteins to pol II. In addition to the activator-interacting Gal11 module, the Rgr1 subcomplex contains an additional module (the Med9/10 module) that interacts with Srb10/11 and GTFs. The reconstituted Srb4 subcomplex also interacts with GTFs and enhances basal transcription without major effect on activated transcription and CTD phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that Mediator is composed of functionally distinct modules required for specific aspects of transcriptional regulation. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing each of the Mediator subunits were created using the Bac-To-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To construct baculoviruses that express an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, the HA epitope sequence (YPYDYPDY; 5′-TACCCATACGACGTGCCAGACTAC-3′) was inserted into the NcoI and EcoRI sites in pFASTBACHTb (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to construct pHA-FASTBACHTb. All of the Mediator genes were cloned by in vivo gap repair, verified by nucleic acid sequencing, and subcloned in-frame into pFASTBACHTb or pHA-FASTBACHTb expression vectors. Recombinant baculoviral clones for each of the Mediator proteins were isolated and amplified to a titer of >1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml. Baculoviruses expressing Flag-Srb10 and Srb11 were provided by S. S. Koh and R. Young. Each recombinant virus was used for infection at a multiplicity of infection of 2. In coinfection experiments, recombinant viruses were infected together at the same multiplicity of infection. Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses, either alone or in combination, were harvested after 48 h of incubation, washed once with a phosphate-buffered saline solution, and then resuspended in 2.5 ml of IP300 buffer (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm potassium acetate) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Next, the lysate was disrupted by Dounce homogenization (20 strokes with a “B” pestle), diluted with the same volume of IP0 buffer (same as IP300 buffer but without potassium acetate), and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitations. For the purification of the reconstituted Srb4 subcomplex, supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer Q150 (20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm potassium acetate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (10 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 nm pepstatin A, 6 nm leupeptin, and 20 μm bisbenzamidine)). The resin was washed with buffer Q150, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer Q600 (same as buffer Q150 but with 600 mm potassium acetate). The eluted proteins were applied to a heparin-Sepharose column. The flow-though proteins were equilibrated into IP150 by dialysis and incubated with anti-HA antibody beads. The beads were washed with IP300, and the bound proteins were eluted with IP150 containing HA peptide (0.5 mg/ml). Rat anti-Rgr1 antiserum (200 μl) was conjugated with protein G-agarose beads (200 μl) as described elsewhere (28Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Each aliquot of antibody beads (20 μl) was incubated for 6 to 12 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of h-pol II (MonoQ fraction) in IP150 buffer, washed three times with 400 μl of IP150 buffer containing 1 to 3 m urea, and finally washed with IP150 buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5), precipitated with 10% trichloroacetate, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), followed by silver staining and immunoblotting with specific antibodies against each Mediator subunit. Extracts (200 μl) from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses, either singly or in combination, were incubated for 6–12 h at 4 °C with anti-HA or anti-Flag antibody-conjugated beads (15 μl). The beads were washed three times with 400 μl of IP150 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 150 mm potassium acetate). The bound proteins were eluted twice with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5). The eluates were treated with 10% trichloroacetate, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. GST or purified GST fusion proteins of TBP, TFIIB, TFIIES, TFIIEL were bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 1 μg of protein/5 μl of beads. Each type of protein bead (25 μl) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with whole cell extracts (200 μl) derived from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses, each expressing Mediator subunits of interest. After binding, the beads were washed three times with binding buffer (400 μl) and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. A reconstituted in vitrotranscription assay was performed as described (10Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Gim B.S. Ryu G.H. Park S.J. Lane W.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To deplete the Mediator complex from the h-pol II fraction, 200 μl of h-pol II (MonoQ fraction) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of anti-Rgr1 antibody-conjugated beads in buffer Q900 (same as buffer Q150 but with 900 mm potassium acetate). The supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube containing an equal amount of the antibody-bound beads and incubated for another 2 h. The final supernatants were kept frozen at −80 °C and used in transcription assays. Using differential dissociation by urea, we previously demonstrated that Mediator can be dissociated into two tightly associated Rgr1 and Srb4 subcomplexes (28Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5364-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although we previously identified several components of each subcomplex (Rgr1, Gal11, Sin4, Hrs1, and Srb7 for Rgr1 subcomplex; and Srb4, Srb2, Srb5, Srb6, Med6, and Rox3 for Srb4 subcomplex), the exact composition of each subcomplex was not known. In particular, the association of the newly identified Mediator components, Med9, Med10, and Med11, was unknown (10Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Gim B.S. Ryu G.H. Park S.J. Lane W.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To address these questions, h-pol II was immobilized on anti-Rgr1 antibody agarose beads, and the proteins retained on the beads after extensive washing with urea-containing buffer were examined by silver staining and immunoblot analyses with specific antibodies against each Mediator component. One molar urea treatment removed completely the core pol II from the immobilized Mediator complex (Fig. 1, lane 2). After 2m urea treatment, Med8 and Med11 were removed from Rgr1-anchored beads together with other Srb4 subcomplex components (Fig. 1, lane 3). When this 2 m urea eluate from Rgr1-anchored h-pol II was immunoprecipitated with anti-Med6 antibody beads, all of the dissociated proteins were coimmunoprecipitated as a complex in the presence of high salt, indicating their physical association within a stable subcomplex (data not shown). On the other hand, Med1, Med2, Med4, Med7, Med9, and Med10 were retained on the antibody beads along with the previously identified components of the Rgr1 subcomplex. Taken together with the previous results, these findings suggested that the Rgr1 subcomplex contains Rgr1 plus the Gal11 module (Gal11, Sin4, Hrs1, and Med2), Med1, Med4, Med7, Med9, Med10, and Srb7, whereas the Srb4 subcomplex contains the remaining Mediator subunits, Srb2, Srb4, Srb5, Srb6, Rox3, Med6, Med8, and Med11. After identifying all of the components of each Mediator subcomplex, we examined the physical interactions among them. We know from electron microscopic structure analysis of h-pol II that the Mediator complex has a modular structure. Compositional analysis of h-pol II in several Mediator mutants showed that Gal11, Hrs1, Med2, and Sin4 form a module attached at the C-terminal region of the Rgr1 subunit (14Li Y. Bjorklund S. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10864-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the other components of the Rgr1 subcomplex (Med1, Med4, Med7, Med9, Srb7, and Med10) also form additional modules. To this end, we constructed baculoviruses expressing these Mediator components, expressed them in pairs, and examined their interactions by coimmunoprecipitation. For each pair, one of the subunits was tagged with HA epitope, and the reaction was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody. We found that Med1 interacted with Med4 and Med7 (Fig. 2 A). In turn, Med4 interacted with Med9, and Med7 interacted with Srb7. In addition, Med10 interacted only with Srb7. No other interactions were observed from other pairs of the Mediator proteins examined (Fig. 2, A and B; Table I). When Sf9 cells were coinfected with Med4, Med7, Med9, Med10, Srb7, and HA-Med1, all six Mediator components were coimmunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2 C). The immunoprecipitations appear to be specific; the anti-HA antibody did not precipitate the Mediator proteins in the absence of the HA-Med1, nor did it precipitate the nonspecific GST protein added to the extracts (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Therefore, these Mediator subunits appear to form a distinct module (hereafter called the Med9/10 module) that interacts with Rgr1 through regions other than its C-terminal region (Fig. 2 D).Table IPairwise interaction between Med9/10 componentsMED1MED4MED7MED9MED10SRB7MED1++−−−MED4+++−−MED7++−−+MED9−+−−−MED10−−−−+SRB7−−+−+ Open table in a new tab Although it was difficult to produce enough recombinant Rgr1 to study its interaction with other Mediator proteins, the urea dissociation experiments showed that at least Med4 can interact with Rgr1. When h-pol II immobilized on Rgr1 antibody beads was washed with 3m urea, all of the core pol II and Mediator subunits except Rgr1 and Med4 were dissociated from the beads (Fig. 1, lane 4). Med4 may not be the only subunit interacting with Rgr1, but it appears to have the strongest affinity for Rgr1. These results suggest that two distinct modules (Gal11 and Med9/10) were associated with Rgr1. The Gal11 module subunits are known to function as specific binding sites for different transcriptional regulators. The detailed function of the Med9/10 module is not yet known. However,med9 and med10 conditional mutants have distinct phenotypes in transcriptional repression and activation (10Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Gim B.S. Ryu G.H. Park S.J. Lane W.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), 2S. J. Han and Y.-J. Kim, unpublished data. and Med9 and Med10 form distinct substructures within the Med9/10 module (Fig. 2 D). These facts suggest that there are distinct functions for submodules within the Rgr1 subcomplex. Previous studies revealed the interactions between some subunits of the Srb4 subcomplex, specifically Srb2, Srb4, Srb5, Srb6, and Med6 (23Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 24Lee T.I. Wyrick J.J. Koh S.S. Jennings E.G. Gadbois E.L. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4455-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To reveal the overall structural features of the Srb4 subcomplex, we extended the mapping of interactions to include the additional components, Med8, Med11, and Rox3. To this end, we constructed baculoviruses for all of the Srb4 subcomplex subunits and examined their pairwise physical interactions by coimmunoprecipitation. Flag- or HA-tagged Srb4 specifically precipitated Med11 and Rox3 from the corresponding cell extracts (Fig. 3 A). However, no detectable interaction between Srb4 and Med8 was observed. Instead, Med8 interacted only with Srb5. Other than these interactions, Med8, Med11, and Rox3 showed no detectable interactions with other components of the Srb4 subcomplex (Fig. 3 A; data not shown). When extracts from Sf9 cells coinfected with Flag-tagged Srb4 and the other untagged subunits of the Srb4 subcomplex were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, all of the Srb4 subcomplex subunits were precipitated together as a single complex only in the presence of the Flag-tagged version of Srb4 protein (Fig. 3 B). Med10, which belongs to the Rgr1 subcomplex, remained in the supernatant. Therefore, a stable Srb4 subcomplex can be assembled in the absence of the Rgr1 subcomplex. The putative structure of the Srb4 subcomplex can be deduced from pairwise interactions (Fig. 3 C). The Mediator core complex, which is composed of the Med9/10 module and part of the Srb4 subcomplex, was recently purified (19Liu Y. Ranish J.A. Aebersold R. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7169-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We examined the interaction between the Med9/10 module and the Srb4 subcomplex in the absence of Rgr1. Extracts from Sf9 cells infected with all the components of the Srb4 subcomplex were incubated with equivalent amounts of extracts from Sf9 cells infected with the Med9/10 module components, and Flag-Srb4 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. The result showed that not only the whole Srb4 subcomplex but also the Med9/10 module was precipitated (Fig. 4). Therefore, we know that the Med9/10 module is able to interact with the Srb4 subcomplex. The identification of the modular structures of the Mediator complex and their compositional analysis suggested that each module might be involved in different aspects of transcription. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the interaction between the distinct modules of Mediator and the basal transcription machinery. The Srb genes were identified as suppressors of Rpb1 CTD truncation mutations, and most but not all of their products are assembled in the Srb4 subcomplex. For this reason, the Srb4 subcomplex has been suggested to interact with the CTD. However, whether it really serves as the only CTD binding site is not known. To address this question, subcomplexes and modules reconstituted from individual Mediator polypeptides were examined for CTD interaction. To test whether the Mediator subcomplexes/modules bound to the CTD fragment sequence-specifically, we also examined the interaction with a mutant CTD fragment that contains five copies of scrambled CTD sequence (STPYPSS). When GST, GST-CTD, or GST-scrambled CTD were incubated with Med9/10 module or Srb4 subcomplex immobilized on anti-HA antibody agarose, only the GST-CTD bound specifically both to the Med9/10 module and the Srb4 subcomplex, whereas GST and GST-scrambled CTD protein did not (Fig. 5 A). This result suggests that the Mediator complex interacts specifically with the CTD of pol II at multiple contact points. We next investigated the interaction between parts of the Mediator complex and GTFs, specifically TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIH. GST pull-down analysis was used to assay reconstituted Med9/10 module or Srb4 subcomplex and GST-tagged GTFs. TBP and TFIIB bound specifically to both the Srb4 subcomplex and the Med9/10 module (Fig. 5 B). The TFIIE large subunit interacted only with the Med9/10 module. There was no detectable interaction between purified TFIIH and either the Med9/10 module or the Srb4 subcomplex (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, TFIIH may associate with Mediator via TFIIE bound to the Med9/10 module. These results indicated that specific subunits of Mediator complex interact not only with pol II but also with several GTFs. Although the Srb8–11 proteins were not identified as tightly associated subunits of Mediator under stringent purification conditions (10Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Gim B.S. Ryu G.H. Park S.J. Lane W.S.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), their association with Mediator complex under different purification conditions has been reported (18Hengartner C.J.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7169-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Additionally, these genes were initially isolated, along with the other Srbgenes, on the basis of their genetic interaction with pol II (18Hengartner C.J. Thompson C.M. Zhang J. Chao D.M. Liao S.M. Koleske A.J. Okamura S. Young R.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that the Srb8–11 subunits may form a separate complex that is loosely associated with the Mediator complex. In particular, Srb10 and Srb11 form a kinase-cyclin pair, which is involved in the negative regulation of pol II transcription through interaction with transcriptional repressors (29Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 30Liao S.M. Zhang J. Jeffery D.A. Koleske A.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2550-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of Mediator subunits that interact with Srb10/11 polypeptides is important to elucidate the mechanism by which Mediator modulates transcriptional repression. To examine whether Srb10/11 associates with the Srb4 subcomplex, as most Srb proteins do, or interacts with the Rgr1 subcomplex as most regulator proteins do, recombinant Mediator subcomplexes were incubated with Srb10/11, and their interactions were monitored by coimmunoprecipitation. When the Srb4 subcomplex was immunoprecipitated with anti-Med8 antibody, all of the Srb4 subcomplex subunits were precipitated together, but the Srb10/11 proteins remained in the supernatant (Fig. 6 A). On the other hand, when Flag-Srb10/11 proteins were mixed with the Med9/10 module of the Rgr1 subcomplex, anti-Flag antibody precipitated the Med9/10 module proteins together with the Flag-Srb10/11, indicating that Srb10/11 interacts with the Med9/10 module (Fig. 6 B). When similar experiments were repeated to identify the Srb10/11-interacting Mediator subunits, Srb10/11 interacted with Med1 and Med4, but there was no detectable interaction with other Mediator subunits of the Med9/10 module (Fig. 6,C and D). It is intriguing that both kinases (TFIIH and Srb10/11) known to be involved in the transcriptional initiation process interact with Mediator, indirectly and directly, through the Med9/10 module, and that the Med9 submodule proteins are involved in transcriptional repression. The Med1 mutant phenotype strongly resembles the Srb10 and Srb11 mutant phenotype (32Balciunas D. Galman C. Ronne H. Bjorklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and a med9 null mutant is defective for transcriptional repression of a number of genes.2 Therefore, the specific interaction of Srb10/11 with the Med9 submodule hinted at the presence of a Mediator submodule possibly specialized for transcriptional repression. In addition to the mediation of transcriptional activation, two additional activities (stimulation of basal transcription and higher phosphorylation of CTD by TFIIH) have been attributed to Mediator (6Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Among the many biochemical activities of the Mediator complex, the Rgr1 subcomplex appears to function mainly in the reception and relay of regulatory signals. Subunits of the Rgr1 subcomplex interact specifically with transcriptional regulatory proteins, and defects in these genes produce phenotypes that resemble those of transcriptional regulatory proteins (20Jiang Y.W. Dohrmann P.R. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 1995; 140: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Park J.M. Kim H.S. Han S.J. Hwang M.S. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8709-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the inclusion of many Srb proteins in the Srb4 subcomplex suggested that its function might be to modulate basal transcription activity. Although the biochemical activities of several mutant Mediator complexes that are deficient for different parts of the Rgr1 subcomplex confirmed the distinct activities associated with the Rgr1 subcomplex (10Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Gim B.S. Ryu G.H. Park S.J. Lane W.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), studies on the Srb4 subcomplex have been lacking. To elucidate the biochemical activities of the Srb4 subcomplex, we purified recombinant Srb4 subcomplex and examined its activity in an in vitro transcription system. Sf9 cells were coinfected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the components of the Srb4 subcomplex together with HA-Srb4. Following the enrichment on Q-Sepharose and heparin chromatographic columns, the Srb4 subcomplex was eluted with HA peptide from an anti-HA antibody column. Silver staining and immunoblot analysis of the eluates revealed that the purified recombinant Srb4 subcomplex contained all of its subunits at approximately equimolar levels (Fig. 7 A). To identify the biochemical activities of the reconstituted Srb4 subcomplex, we examined whether the recombinant Srb4 subcomplex enhances CTD phosphorylation efficiency by TFIIH as the Mediator complex does. The addition of the Srb4 subcomplex to the phosphorylation reaction caused no detectable enhancement of phosphorylation by TFIIH (data not shown). However, when we added the Srb4 subcomplex to an in vitro transcription system reconstituted with pure transcription factors and h-pol II, it stimulated basal transcription 2–3-fold, without a major effect on activated transcription (less than 1.2-fold) (Fig. 7 B). This result indicated that additional Srb4 subcomplex enhances basal transcription activity even in the presence of the endogenous Mediator complex. To examine the role of the Srb4 subcomplex in the absence of intact Mediator, we depleted endogenous Mediator complex from h-pol II (MonoQ fraction) by immunodepletion using anti-Rgr1 antibody under high salt conditions (900 mm). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the core pol II and its associated TFIIF in the supernatant did not contain a detectable amount of Mediator (Fig. 8 A). Depletion of Mediator complex from h-pol II diminished both the basal and activated transcription to less than 5% of their activities before the Mediator depletion (Fig. 8 B). This residual transcriptional activation may have resulted from a small amount of Mediator complex left after the immunodepletion. When we added an increasing amount of recombinant Srb4 subcomplex back to the Mediator-depleted transcription system, we observed a gradual increase in both the basal and activated transcription (Fig. 8 C). However, the addition of the Srb4 subcomplex did not affect activation itself; the enhancement of activated transcription by the Srb4 subcomplex appeared to result from the increase in basal transcription activity (Fig. 8 D). Taken together, these results suggest that Srb4 subcomplex may have activity that enhances basal transcription. The Mediator complex is required for diverse aspects of the transcription process, such as activation, repression, and stimulation of basal transcription. The diversity of these functions has raised the possibility that the Mediator complex contains functionally distinct modules. We previously demonstrated the existence of Rgr1 and Srb4 subcomplexes and identified the Gal11 module within the Rgr1 subcomplex as an activator-binding module. Here we show biochemical evidence to demonstrate another distinct module (Med9/10) within the Rgr1 subcomplex, its physical interaction with Srb10/11 proteins, and the biochemical activity of the Srb4 subcomplex in stimulating basal transcription. Our urea-dissociation experiment confirmed the previous observation that the Mediator complex is composed of two distinct subcomplexes, Rgr1 and Srb4, and further defined the components belonging to each of them. The Srb4 subcomplex contains Srb4 plus 8 Mediator components (Srb2, Srb5, Srb6, Srb8, Rox3, Med6, Med8, and Med11). The interaction study with recombinant Mediator proteins revealed that Srb4 plays a critical role as a scaffold for Srb4 subcomplex assembly (Fig. 3 C). In fact, the subcomplex was not formed in the absence of Srb4 (data not shown). The importance of Srb4 as a structural component may account for the global effect of the srb4 temperature-sensitive mutation on pol II transcription, as shown by whole genome expression analysis (25Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Although h-pol II lacking Srb5 or Srb2 displays defects in both basal and activated transcription in a reconstituted in vitro system, the recruitment of the h-pol II to promoter was not affected by a srb5 mutation (11Koleske A.J. Buratowski S. Nonet M. Young R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 21Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, Srb4 and its associated components appear to play a critical role in the modulation of basal transcription machinery rather than act in the reception of gene-specific activator signals. Here, we demonstrate that a highly purified recombinant Srb4 subcomplex is able to stimulate basal transcription activity of pol II in an in vitrotranscription assay. This activity is unlikely to be derived from the enhancement of TFIIH activity by the Srb4 subcomplex because we could not observed an increase in CTD phosphorylation efficiency by the addition of the recombinant Srb4 subcomplex to an in vitrotranscription system. This finding may have resulted from an interaction of the Srb4 subcomplex with other general transcription factors (TBP, TFIIB, and CTD). Our study also showed that the Rgr1 subcomplex contains Rgr1 plus 10 additional Mediator components. The Rgr1 subcomplex may play an important role as a core scaffold upon which the other components are assembled to form a stable subcomplex as Srb4 does in the Srb4 subcomplex. Previous genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the Rgr1 subcomplex contains at least one activator-binding module (Gal11, Sin4, Hrs1, and Med2) that associates with the C-terminal domain of Rgr1 (20Jiang Y.W. Dohrmann P.R. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 1995; 140: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Dotson M.R. Yuan C.X. Roeder R.G. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Jiang Y.W. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14307-14310Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrated that the Rgr1 subcomplex contains another distinct module, the Med9/10 module. The Med9/10 module contains six Mediator subunits, which are divided into the Med9 and Med10 submodules. These submodules probably interact with Rgr1 through regions other than the Rgr1 C-terminal domain. In particular, the similar phenotype of Med1 mutants to those of Srb10/11 mutants, and the physical interaction of Srb10/11 with Med4 and Med1, indicate the involvement of the Med9 submodule in transcriptional repression mediated by Srb10/11 proteins. Recently, we observed that the deletion of Med9 derepresses transcription from a subset of genes in yeast (33Han S.J. Lee J.-S. Kang J.S. Kim Y.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37020-37026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and we identified a weak genetic interaction between Med9 and repressor proteins such as Rpd3 histone deacetylase.2 These observations suggest that the Med9 submodule may function in modulating the effect of repressors on pol II transcription. Because Srb components were originally identified as dominant suppressors for CTD truncation, it has been suggested that Srb components may interact physically with the CTD of pol II. Hence, our observation of physical interaction between CTD and the Srb4 subcomplex demonstrated that the Srb4 subcomplex interacts functionally and physically with CTD. In addition, it is also interesting that the Med9/10 module within the Rgr1 subcomplex interacts physically with CTD. The electron microscopic structural analysis of h-pol II also shows two distinct contact points between Mediator complex and pol II (26Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27Dotson M.R. Yuan C.X. Roeder R.G. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Jiang Y.W. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14307-14310Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, the Mediator complex has multiple contact points for pol II. Besides the physical interaction with pol II, Mediator interacts physically with several GTFs. The Srb4 subcomplex interacts with TBP and TFIIB, whereas the Med9/10 module interacts with TBP, TFIIB, and TFIIEL. This result suggests that these interactions may accelerate and stabilize the formation of the preinitiation complex (PIC). This notion is supported by the finding that recruitment of GTFs such as TBP, TFIIB, and TFIIH to active promoters requires the function of Mediator (34Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 35Li X.Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 399: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, these interactions may account for the previous observation that, after initiation, Mediator, along with TFIIA, TFIID, TFIIH, and TFIIE, remains at the promoter forming a scaffold for assembly of a second PIC (36Ranish J.A. Yudkovsky N. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 37Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Mediator and GTFs are involved in the formation of PIC or formation of a functional reinitiation complex remains to be further analyzed. We thank S. S. Koh and Richard Young for providing baculovirus clones for Srb10 and Srb11. We thank our colleagues in the Kim laboratory for helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2086113348,"The discovery of G-rich oligonucleotides (GROs) that have non-antisense antiproliferative activity against a number of cancer cell lines has been recently described. This biological activity of GROs was found to be associated with their ability to form stable G-quartet-containing structures and their binding to a specific cellular protein, most likely nucleolin (Bates, P. J., Kahlon, J. B., Thomas, S. D., Trent, J. O., and Miller, D. M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 26369–26377). In this report, we further investigate the novel mechanism of GRO activity by examining their effects on cell cycle progression and on nucleic acid and protein biosynthesis. Cell cycle analysis of several tumor cell lines showed that cells accumulate in S phase in response to treatment with an active GRO. Analysis of 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation by these cells indicated the absence of de novo DNA synthesis, suggesting an arrest of the cell cycle predominantly in S phase. At the same time point, RNA and protein synthesis were found to be ongoing, indicating that arrest of DNA replication is a primary event in GRO-mediated inhibition of proliferation. This specific blockade of DNA replication eventually resulted in altered cell morphology and induction of apoptosis. To characterize further GRO-mediated inhibition of DNA replication, we used an in vitro assay based on replication of SV40 DNA. GROs were found to be capable of inhibiting DNA replication in the in vitro assay, and this activity was correlated to their antiproliferative effects. Furthermore, the effect of GROs on DNA replication in this assay was related to their inhibition of SV40 large T antigen helicase activity. The data presented suggest that the antiproliferative activity of GROs is a direct result of their inhibition of DNA replication, which may result from modulation of a replicative helicase activity.

This is a major reason why they have been widely investigated as potential therapeutic agents for cancer, viral infections, and inflammatory diseases. Oligonucleotides can achieve target recognition by sequence-specific interactions with nucleic acids or proteins such as in the antisense, antigene, or decoy approaches (1Gewirtz A.M. Sokol D.L.

Alternatively, target recognition can be due to the specific three-dimensional structure of an oligonucleotide, as in the aptamer approach (5Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13581-13584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Hermann T. Patel D.J. Science. 2000; 287: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). These aptameric oligonucleotides often contain secondary structure elements such as hairpins or G-quartets. The formation of G-quartet structures is also thought to contribute to non-antisense growth inhibitory effects of G-rich phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (7Burgess T.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26369-26377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) on a novel class of phosphodiester G-rich oligonucleotides (GROs)1 that could strongly inhibit the in vitro proliferation of tumor cells derived from prostate, breast, and cervical carcinomas. The antiproliferative GROs were able to form stable secondary structures consistent with G-quartet formation. It was determined that these GROs bound to a specific nuclear protein and, furthermore, that the growth inhibitory activity of the GROs was positively correlated with their ability to bind to this protein. The specific GRO-binding protein was captured using biotinylated GROs and was identified by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to nucleolin. Therefore, we concluded that these potentially therapeutic oligonucleotides worked by a novel mechanism that involved binding to nucleolin or a nucleolin-like protein. Our hypothesis was that binding of GROs causes inhibition of nucleolin function(s) that results in an arrest of proliferation. Nucleolin is an abundant 110-kDa phosphoprotein, thought to be located predominantly in the nucleolus of proliferating cells. Levels of nucleolin are known to relate to the rate of cellular proliferation (10Derenzini M. Sirri V. Trere D. Ochs R.L. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 497-502PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sirri V. Roussel P. Hernandez-Verdun D. Micron. 2000; 31: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), being elevated in rapidly dividing cells such as malignant cells. Therefore, nucleolin may be an attractive molecular target for cancer therapy. The remarkable multifunctionality of nucleolin and its role in cell growth and proliferation have been highlighted in recent reviews (12Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 407-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The most studied aspects of nucleolin function are its roles in ribosome biogenesis, which include the control of rDNA transcription, pre-ribosome packaging, and organization of nucleolar chromatin (12Tuteja R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It is also thought that nucleolin can act as a shuttle protein that transports viral and cellular proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus/nucleolus of the cell (16Kibbey M.C. Johnson B.

Clearly, inhibition of nucleolin function, which we propose is an effect of GRO binding, would likely result in inhibition of cell proliferation and/or cell death. To elucidate further the mechanism of the GRO antiproliferative activity, we decided to study the effects of GROs on cellular processes, such as nucleic acid and protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression. We report our findings that GROs specifically inhibit DNA replication, and we discuss the implications of these results in terms of potential mechanisms for GRO activity. Except where indicated, oligonucleotides had phosphodiester backbones and 3′-C-3 aminoalkyl modifications. They were purchased from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR) or synthesized on a Beckman 1000M synthesizer using 3′-C-3-amine CPG columns from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Oligonucleotides were resuspended in water, precipitated with butan-1-ol, washed with 70% ethanol, dried and resuspended in sterile 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). They were then sterilized by filtration through a 0.2-μm filter and diluted with sterile buffer to give stock solutions of 400 or 500 μm that were stored in aliquots at −20 °C. Each oligonucleotide was checked for integrity by 5′-radiolabeling followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sequences of oligonucleotides used were as follows: GRO29A, 5′-TTTGGTGGTGGTGGTTGTGGTGGTGGTGG; GRO15B, 5′-TTGGGGGGGGTGGGT; GRO15A, 5′-GTTGTTTGGGGTGGT; GRO26A, 5′-GGTTGGGGTGGGTGGGGTGGGTGGGG; GRO26B,5′-GGTGGTGGTGGTTGTGGTGGTGGTGG; and CRO, 5′-TTTCCTCCTCCTCCTTCTCCTCCTCCTCC. For the experiments shown in Figs. 1 and 2 B, cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a density of 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h to permit adherence, cells were treated by direct addition of oligonucleotide to the culture medium to give a final concentration of 10 μm. For MDA-MB-231 cells only, a second dose of oligonucleotide was added 24 h after the first. At 72 h after the first dose, cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide using the Cycle Test Plus kit (Becton Dickinson). Cells were then analyzed using a FACScan cytometer. The percentage of cells in G1/G0, S, and G2/M were determined using the Modfit program or, in a few cases where Modfit was unable to assign these parameters, by integrating peak areas using the CellQuest program. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2 B, cells were treated as above and harvested at the times shown and analyzed as described.Figure 2A, flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle parameters. DU145 cells were partially synchronized by either serum starvation or aphidicolin treatment (top panel). Cells were treated with 10 μm GRO29A at the time of release from synchronization and analyzed after 24 h (bottom panel). B, graph showing the percentage of cells accumulated in S phase for asynchronous DU145 cells treated with GRO29A or control oligonucleotide (GRO15B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To synchronize by serum starvation, cells were plated in complete medium (DMEM, 10% FCS, 1% antibiotic) at a density of 5 × 104 per well in 6-well plates and incubated overnight. Cells were washed three times with sterile PBS, and the medium was replaced with DMEM with 0.1% (v/v) FCS. After incubation in low serum medium for 48 h, medium was replaced with complete medium, and GRO29A was added directly to the medium to give 10 μm final concentration. To synchronize cells in S phase, cells were incubated for 16 h in complete medium containing 1 μg/ml aphidicolin. Cells were released by washing three times with PBS and adding complete medium. GRO29A was then added directly to the medium to give a final concentration of 10 μm. For each method of synchronization, samples were prepared in parallel to be harvested for flow cytometric analysis before release or 24 h after addition of GRO29A. Analysis of cell cycle was carried out as described above. Cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 103 cells per well, in a 48-well plate. Cells were incubated for 16 h and then treated by direct addition of oligonucleotide to the culture medium at a final concentration of 12 μm (or untreated samples received an equal volume of sterile PBS). A second identical dose was given 60 h after the first. 72 h after the first treatment, cells were pulsed by addition of BrdUrd (Sigma, final concentration 10 μm) to the medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with methanol for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were washed with PBS, incubated with 2m HCl (to denature DNA) for 10 min on ice, washed, and neutralized with 0.1 m sodium borate. The cells were then incubated with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson, used at 1.7 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and incubated with Alexa488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, used at 4 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope with ELWD epifluorescence attachment, and digital images were captured using a Olympus DP10 camera. Samples shown in Fig. 4 Bwere prepared exactly as described for DNA synthesis, and after 72 h of incubation with oligonucleotide samples were pulsed by addition of BrU (Aldrich) at a final concentration of 1 mmfor 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, stained as above (1.7 μg/ml anti-BrdUrd followed by 4 μg/ml Alexa488-labeled anti-mouse IgG), and photographed as described above. For the samples shown in Fig.4 A, cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml actinomycin D for 1 h at 37 °C prior to pulsing with BrU or were incubated with 2.5 mg/ml RNase A for 30 min after fixing. Samples were prepared exactly as described for DNA synthesis. After 72 h of incubation with oligonucleotide, cells were washed twice with methionine/cysteine-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in this medium, and then pulsed by addition of [35S]methionine (final concentration 40 μCi/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, proteins were extracted by addition of 100 μl of citrate saline solution and precipitated by addition of 400 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 20 mmpyrophosphate. An aliquot of this solution was used to quantitate total protein using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce), and the remainder was filtered through a glass filter to determine trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts. Protein synthesis was expressed as counts/min per μg of total protein. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and error bars represent the S.E. Cells were plated (1.5 × 104 cells per well for DU145 or 4 × 104 cells per well for MDA-MB-231) in 24-well plates containing glass coverslips (Fisher) that had been washed and sterilized. Oligonucleotide was added directly to the medium to a final concentration of 10 μm at 4 h after plating. Further identical doses were given at 24 and 72 h subsequent to the first dose (cells shown in Fig. 6 A did not receive the third dose). At the appropriate time, cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized by incubation in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. Terminal transferase-mediated labeling of fragmented DNA with dUTP was carried out using In SituCell Death Detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For morphology analysis cells were prepared as above and viewed using an Olympus BX60 microscope. Replication-competent cell extracts were prepared from HeLa cells by a modification of the method of Li and Kelly (29Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4249-4258Google Scholar, 30Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1238-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% supplemented calf serum (HyClone) and antibiotics and were maintained in logarithmic growth. Briefly, the cells were released, combined, and washed once with isotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mmsucrose) and twice with hypotonic buffer (isotonic buffer without sucrose). Following the second hypotonic wash, the cell count was adjusted to 7 × 107 cells/ml, and the suspension was placed on ice for 30 min. The cells were gently lysed using a Dounce glass homogenizer and a tight-fitting plunger and then placed on ice for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen by dripping it through liquid nitrogen. Replication reactions were carried out using the M13mp2SV replication template (7406 base pairs), which is an M13mp2 molecule containing the SV40 origin of replication (31Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7064-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Replicative form templates were prepared from infected recA Escherichia coliby standard methods, and covalently closed circular (form I) DNA was isolated by two successive CsCl gradients. Template (40 ng) was preincubated with water or the oligonucleotide (400 nmfinal concentration) as indicated for 30 min at 37 °C and then added to reaction mixes as described previously (32McGregor W.G. Wei D. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Replication reactions (25 μl) contained 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 7 mmMgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 200 μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP, 100 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, TTP, and [α-32P]dCTP (6,600 dpm/fmol), 40 mmcreatine phosphate, 2 μg of creatine kinase, and 15 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The SV40 large T antigen (Molecular Biology Resources) was omitted from the negative control (Fig. 7, 1st lane), and 1 μg was added to all other tubes. After addition of cell extract (75 μg of protein) to each tube, the reactions proceeded for 2 h at 37 °C. At this time, an equal volume of stop solution (2% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml proteinase K) was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. An aliquot (1/10 volume) was taken for determination of [α-32P]dCTP into acid-insoluble material, and picomoles of dCTP incorporated was calculated. The relative dCTP incorporation stated in the text represents the average of three independent experiments, and standard errors of the data are shown. The DNA was extracted, and aliquots were electrophoresed on 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The dried gels were imaged on a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the density of the bands corresponding to covalently closed circular (form I) DNA was quantified using ImageQuant software. HeLa cells were plated at 103 cells per well in 96-well plates. After incubation for 16 h, oligonucleotide was added directly to the culture medium to give a final concentration of 12 μm. Culture medium was not changed throughout the duration of the experiment. The relative number of viable cells in each well was determined 96 h after addition of oligonucleotides using the MTT assay (33Morgan D.M. Methods. Mol. Biol. 1998; 79: 179-183PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μl of 5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) was added to each well. Following 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were lysed by addition of 75 μl per well of 10% SDS, 10 mm HCl, and after a further 16 h of incubation at 37 °C, absorbance at 570 nm was determined using a Molecular Devices microplate reader. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and bars represent the S.E. These assays were carried out according to a method similar to that of Veaute et al. (34Veaute X. Mari-Giglia G. Lawrence C.W. Sarasin A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide 55A (5′-TGAAGGTTTCGAATCAGAGGTAGGTGCCCGGCCTCCAACTTGCCGTATTCCTGGT, unmodified phosphodiester, purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.) was 5′-labeled using T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. After removal of unincorporated [32P]ATP it was annealed (95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature) to a partially complementary oligonucleotide 55B (5′-ACCAGGAATACGGCAAGTTGGAGGCCGGGCTGGATGGAGACTAAGCTTTGGAAGT, unmodified phosphodiester, purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.) in order to form the synthetic replication fork substrate containing a region of 30 base pairs (underlined). Unwinding of this substrate by recombinant SV40 large T antigen (Chimerx, Milwaukee, WI) was carried out by incubating 10 fmol of substrate with 100 ng of large T antigen in the absence or presence of competitor unlabeled oligonucleotides in a final volume of 10 μl of HA buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Large T antigen was preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C prior to addition. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C before being terminated by addition of STOP buffer (200 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.6% SDS, 0.15% bromphenol blue, 0.15% xylene cyanol). Samples were analyzed by native polyacrylamide electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 1× TBE (90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA) with 1× TBE, 0.1% SDS as running buffer. For the assay shown in Fig.8 A, the nonspecific competitor oligonucleotide was (NS) (5′-AGGACTGTATACTGTCTTGGA, unmodified phosphodiester, purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.), and 29A is this assay was also unmodified. For the assay shown in Fig. 8 B, all oligonucleotides except NS were modified with a 3′-C-3 aminoalkyl group. Immunoprecipitation was carried out in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin) for 30 min at 37 °C using 25 μg of HeLa extracts (as used forin vitro replication) and 5 μg of monoclonal antibody to 14-kDa subunit of RPA (Novus Biologicals). Antibodies were captured for 1 h at 4 °C using magnetic beads linked to goat anti-mouse IgG (Magnabind, Pierce), washed three times with 0.5 ml of RIPA, and eluted by heating the beads for 15 min at 65 °C in a buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. To investigate the effect of GROs on nucleolin-RPA interaction, the HeLa extracts were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of oligonucleotides. Precipitated proteins were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide/SDS gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Western-blotted using nucleolin monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200 dilution) and peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), and visualized by chemiluminescence. To investigate cell cycle perturbations induced by antiproliferative G-rich oligonucleotides, flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide stained nuclei was performed. Cell cycle parameters were compared for untreated cells and cells that had been treated for 72 h with an active GRO (GRO29A) or a control inactive GRO (GRO15B). The cell lines examined were DU145 (derived from prostate carcinoma), MDA-MB-231 (breast carcinoma), HeLa (cervical carcinoma), and HS27 (normal foreskin fibroblasts). In all of the carcinoma lines, we observed a significant increase in the fraction of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle for cells treated with GRO29A, as shown in Fig.1. This was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle, as indicated in Fig. 1. These changes were specific for GRO29A and not simply due to the presence of oligonucleotide, because cells treated with GRO15B were similar to untreated cells. We also observed the appearance of a peak corresponding to a population of cells with sub-G1 DNA content (marked with anasterisk in Fig. 1). This peak, which is indicative of apoptotic cells, appeared in the tumor cell samples treated with GRO29A but was much smaller in the GRO15B-treated or untreated cells. The induction of apoptosis by GRO29A was examined further and will be described below. In contrast to the malignant cell lines, HS27 cells, which are derived from normal skin fibroblasts, showed no major perturbations in cell cycle in response to treatment with GRO29A. The HS27 cells were also found to be considerably less sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of GRO29A than most of the tumor cell lines we have examined. 2P. J. Bates, S. D. Thomas, J. O. Trent, and D. M. Miller, unpublished observations. However, it can be seen from the data (Fig. 1, untreated) that the HS27 cells have a much lower proportion in S phase (even though they are sub-confluent), compared with the tumor cell lines, and proliferate at a slower rate. To test whether the response of cells is related to the proportion of cells in S phase when GRO is added, we partially synchronized DU145 cells and added GRO29A when the cells were predominantly in S phase (after aphidicolin treatment) or G1/G0 (after serum starvation). Fig.2 A shows that the cells showed similar S phase accumulation, irrespective of the proportion of cells in S phase when GRO was added. These data suggest that the differential responsiveness of HS27 cells is not necessarily related to the lower proportion of these cells in S phase, but further studies are required to confirm the tumor selectivity of GRO29A and investigate the mechanism of selectivity. Studies of cell cycle progression following partial synchronization of tumor cells showed that even when GRO29A was added in G1/G0 (following serum synchronization) or early S phase (following aphidicolin treatment), a considerable proportion of the cells were able to progress through S phase and G2/M (data not shown). In fact, the accumulation of cells in S phase was found to be a gradual process that occurs over several cell cycles, as shown in Fig. 2 B for unsynchronized DU145 cells treated with GRO29A. The gradual arrest of cells in S phase may be related to the rate of oligonucleotide uptake, which is thought to b"

Stx has two isoforms, Stx1 and Stx2, and in clinical settings Stx2 is known to cause more severe symptoms, although the differences between the mechanisms of action of Stx1 and Stx2 are as yet unknown. In this study, the binding modes of these two isoforms to the receptor were investigated with a surface plasmon resonance analyzer to compare differences by real time receptor binding analysis. A sensor chip having a lipophilically modified dextran matrix or quasicrystalline hydrophobic layer was used to immobilize an amphipathic lipid layer that mimics the plasma membrane surface. Dose responsiveness was observed with both isoforms when either the toxin concentration or the Gb3Cer concentration was increased. In addition, this assay was shown to be specific, because neither Stx1 nor Stx2 bound to GM3, but both bound weakly to Gb4Cer. It was also shown that a number of fitting models can be used to analyze the sensorgrams obtained with different concentrations of the toxins, and the ""bivalent analyte"" model was found to best fit the interaction between Stxs and Gb3Cer. This shows that the interaction between Stxs and Gb3Cer in the lipid bilayer has a multivalent effect. The presence of cholesterol in the lipid bilayer significantly enhanced the binding of Stxs to Gb3Cer, although kinetics were unaffected. The association and dissociation rate constants of Stx1 were larger than those of Stx2: Stx2 binds to the receptor more slowly than Stx1 but, once bound, is difficult to dissociate. The data described herein clearly demonstrate differences between the binding properties of Stx1 and Stx2 and may facilitate understanding of the differences in clinical manifestations caused by these toxins."

Streptomyces pristinaespiraliscontains a gene cluster encoding enzymes and regulatory proteins for the biosynthesis of pristinamycin, a clinically important streptogramin antibiotic complex. One of these proteins, PapR1, belongs to a well known family of Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins. Gel shift assays using crude cytoplasmic extracts detected SpbR, a developmentally regulated protein that bound to the papR1 promoter. SpbR was purified, and its gene was cloned using reverse genetics. spbR encoded a 25-kDa protein similar to Streptomyces autoregulatory proteins of the butyrolactone receptor family, including scbR from Streptomyces coelicolor. In Escherichia coli, purified SpbR and ScbR produced bound sequences immediately upstream of papR1, spbR, and scbR. SpbR DNA-binding activity was inhibited by an extracellular metabolite with chromatographic properties similar to those of the well known γ-butyrolactone signaling compounds. DNase I protection assays mapped the SpbR-binding site in the papR1 promoter to a sequence homologous to other known butyrolactone autoregulatory elements. A nucleotide data base search showed that these binding motifs were primarily located upstream of genes encoding Streptomycesantibiotic regulatory proteins and butyrolactone receptors in various Streptomyces species. Disruption of the spbRgene in S. pristinaespiralis resulted in severe defects in growth, morphological differentiation, pristinamycin biosynthesis, and expression of a secreted superoxide dismutase.

To facilitate subsequent discussions of the γ-butyrolactone signaling system, its components and their functions are diagrammed in Fig. 1. Many γ-butyrolactone receptors (GABRs)1 bind to a conserved nucleotide motif (autoregulatory element) (ARE)) and thus act as repressors of transcription (8Kinoshita H. Tsuji T. Ipposhi H. Nihira T. Yamada Y. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5075-5080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The butyrolactones that accumulate in culture media are thought to act as quorum signaling molecules by releasing their corresponding GABR proteins from operator sites, thus activating gene expression (6Kinoshita H. Ipposhi H. Okamoto S. Nakano H. Nihira T. Yamada Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6986-6993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Developmental systems under butyrolactone control have been best characterized in S. griseus and Streptomyces virginiae. Studies of Horinouchi, Beppu, and co-workers (9Onaka H. Ando N. Nihira T. Yamada Y. Beppu T. Horinouchi S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6083-6092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) support a model describing how A-Factor and its receptor in S. griseus, ArpA, mediate pleiotropic effects on development. Binding of A-Factor to ArpA derepresses expression of a transcriptional activator, AdpA (10Ohnishi Y. Kameyama S. Onaka H. Horinouchi S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). AdpA promotes expression of strR, the activator of streptomycin biosynthetic genes, and other unknown genes that control aerial mycelium formation. In S. virginiae, butyrolactones and a corresponding receptor (BarA) take part in regulating synthesis of a streptogramin complex called virginiamycin (11Nakano H. Takehara E. Nihira T. Yamada Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3317-3322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via unknown regulatory pathways. Related Streptomycesantibiotic regulatory proteins (SARPs) commonly activate expression of biosynthetic gene clusters. Thus, SARPs are potentially the ultimate target for some quorum-sensing signaling pathways that switch on antibiotic biosynthesis (12Bibb M.

Gram-negative bacteria employ quorum-sensing systems based on homoserine lactones, structurally related to γ-butyrolactones, to control a diverse array of density-dependent phenotypes (13Parsek M.R. Greenberg E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8789-8793Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 14Fuqua C. Greenberg E.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In Pseudomonas, quorum-sensing systems control synthesis of virulence factors as well as enzymes such as catalases that detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide dismutase (15Hassett D.J. Ma J.F. Elkins J.G. McDermott T.R. Ochsner U.A. West S.E. Huang C.T. Fredericks J. Burnett S. Stewart P.S. McFeters G. Passador L. Iglewski B.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutases are ubiquitous parts of cellular defenses against oxidative stress that catalyze dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thus preventing the spontaneous formation of more toxic forms of ROS by the Haber-Weiss reaction. The two classes of superoxide dismutases described in Streptomyces utilize either Ni2+(SodN) or Fe2+/Zn2+ (SodF) as cofactors. Ni2+ represses the constitutive expression of sodF expression and induces sodN (16Kim F.J. Kim H.P. Hah Y.C. Roe J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). ROS may come from endogenous metabolism or exogenous sources. Primary metabolic conversions that generate ROS are largely limited to flavin and flavoproteins that activate molecular oxygen (17Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such monooxygenases often participate in the respiratory chain within the cytoplasmic membrane. In contrast, pathogenic bacteria probably employ superoxide dismutase to defend themselves against external ROS they may encounter as part of the host antimicrobial response. The SodF released by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is thought to protect the organism from oxidative attack by macrophages (18Harth G. Horwitz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4281-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our studies involved S. pristinaespiralis, a saprophytic soil organism that produces pristinamycin, a clinically important streptogramin antibiotic complex. Like other streptogramins, it is a mixture of compounds based on two structurally dissimilar synergistic antibiotics. The streptogramin B component, pristinamycin I (PI), is a cyclic hexadepsipeptide; the streptogramin A compound, pristinamycin II (PII), is a polyunsaturated cyclic peptolide (19Preud'homme J. Tarridec P. Belloc A. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1968; 2: 585-591PubMed Google Scholar). PI and PII biosynthetic genes are clustered together with papR1 (putative regulator ofpristinamycin antibioticproduction), the SARP gene described here. We purified SpbR (S.p ristinaespiralis butyrolactone-responsive transcriptionalrepressor), a GABR protein that bound to a site upstream of the papR1 promoter, and showed that the corresponding gene was required not only for colonial development and antibiotic biosynthesis, but also for expression of a leaderless superoxide dismutase found as the major protein in the medium. The bacterial strains included E. coli SG13609, XL1-Blue, and M15; S. pristinaespiralis NRRL2958;Streptomyces coelicolor MT1110; and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633. pUC18, pUC21, and the expression system pDS56/RBSII were used as E. coli vectors. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and T4 DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Techniques for handling Streptomyceshave been described (20Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F.

John Innes Institute, Norwich, United Kingdom1985Google Scholar). Streptomyces protoplasts were transformed, spread on R2YE medium, and allowed to regenerate for 20 h at 30 °C (20Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Institute, Norwich, United Kingdom1985Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by overlaying the plates with 1 ml of aqueous apramycin (1 mg) or thiostrepton (0.3 mg). To enhance integration into the chromosome via homologous recombination, plasmids were alkali-denatured before protoplast transformation (21Oh S.H. Chater K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 122-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli cells were transformed by calcium shock or electroporation (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 74-82Google Scholar). HT7T contained (per liter): white dextrin, 10 g; NZ amine-A, 2 g; Lab Lemco beef powder, 1 g; yeast extract, 1 g; and 1 ml of trace elements stock solution (CaCl2·2H2O, 11 g; FeSO4·7H2O, 7 g; MnCl2·4H2O, 2 g; ZnSO4·7H2O, 2 g; CuSO4·7H2O, 0.4 g; CoCl2·6H2O, 0.4 g; 45 g/l EDTA-Na2·2H2O, in 1 l of ddH2O pH 7.4). NE solid medium contained 10 g/liter glucose, 2 g/liter yeast extract (Difco), 1 g/liter Lab Lemco powder, and 15 g/liter agar (Difco) (pH 7.0). Minimal inoculum medium contained 20 g/liter saccharose, 5 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 0.75 g/liter K2HPO4, 0.3 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 1 ml of trace element stock, and 40 g/liter MOPS (pH 6.8). Minimal production medium contained 40 g/liter glucose, 13 g/liter l-glutamate, 1.2 g/liter K2HPO4, 0.3 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, and 1 ml of trace elements stock solution (pH 6.8). Mannitol soya medium contained 20 g/l mannitol, 20 g/l soya meal, and 20 g/l Difco agar. S. pristinaespiralis NRRL2958 spores (5 × 108) grown on HT7T medium were inoculated in a 250-ml baffled flask containing 100 ml of minimal inoculum medium. After incubation on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm for 26 h at 30 °C, the culture served as inoculum for a 2-liter pilot fermenter containing minimal inoculum medium (pH 6.8). The fermentation was carried out at 28 °C with constant aeration. For strains containing plasmid pNL5 or pIJ904, the media were supplemented with thiostrepton (3 μg/ml). DNA fragments were end-labeled by filling in with Klenow fragment or fully labeled by PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. This generated probes of different specific activities for use in gel retardation assays. Crude or semipurified DNA-binding proteins (5 μg) were incubated with radiolabeled DNA fragment (0.006 pmol of the filled-in probe and 0.06 pmol of the PCR-generated probe) in the presence of 1–5 μg of competitor DNA (poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC), Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 μl of tris buffer containing additives (TA; 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with 250 mm NaCl. After incubation, the reaction mixture was resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 90 mm Tris, 90 mmborate, and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8), run at room temperature and constant voltage (7 V cm−1) for 2 h. Gels were dried, and radioactive bands were recorded by autoradiography or on a PhosphorImager. A 322-bp fragment of S. pristinaespiralis DNA (nucleotides 113–435; GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numberAY026762) including the region upstream of papR1 was amplified by PCR (forward primer, CCCAAGCTTCGAACACGGCTCCTACCAA; and reverse primer, CGGGATCCATGGCGTTTCGTCTTC) and subcloned into HindIII/BamHI-cleaved pUC18 (pMF1). For the P spbR-ARE1 (where “P” is promoter) and P spbR-ARE2 fragments, the region upstream of spbRcorresponding to nucleotides 40–424 (accession number AY026762) was PCR-amplified (forward primer, GGGTCGTCCGGTGGTCTAGGGATG; and reverse primer, CGCCGCGTCCTCACGGCCCGCTCCTGCCGC). The two ARE sequences encoded by this fragment were separated by cleavage at an NdeI site (position 163). The intergenic region between adhC and mutT was PCR-amplified (forward primer, CTGGTCGGGGGTGCGGTCGG; and reverse primer, GCCTGCCAGCCCACGGTGGTCCT) to generate the P adh fragment (nucleotides 1351–1516; accession number AL357432). The region upstream of scbR was PCR-amplified (forward primer, AAAACTACTGCTTCGGGCATGGT; and reverse primer, GGATCGCCCGGTCCTGCTTGGC) to generate the P scbRfragment (nucleotides 2896–3056; accession number AJ007731). Stationary phase mycelia grown in HT7T medium were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 250 ml of TA buffer supplemented with 10 mm NaCl (TAN buffer), and stored at −80 °C. All steps of the purification were carried out at 4 °C. The mycelia (∼100 g), harvested from 15-liter cultures, were disrupted by sonication for 10 min at 90 watts (Sonifer B12) in 200 ml of TA buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl. Protease inhibitors (benzamidine, pepstatin, and leupeptin; 1 μg/ml final concentration; Sigma) were added prior to sonication. After sonication, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 mm) was added. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 9000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor (13,000 ×g). Ammonium sulfate (Schwarz/Mann) was slowly added to the cooled protein extract to a final concentration of 28% (w/v). The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall GSA rotor. Soluble proteins were precipitated using ammonium sulfate (60% (w/v) final concentration) and collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 60 min in a Sorvall GSA rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 150 ml of TAN buffer, dialyzed against 10 liters of the same buffer, and then clarified by centrifugation for 30 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 12,000 rpm (17,300 × g). The protein pellet was redissolved in TA buffer. The protein sample was then loaded onto a 150-ml DEAE-Sepharose column (XK 26/50 Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with TAN buffer. The column was washed with TAN buffer, and proteins were eluted in a 600-ml salt gradient of 10–450 mm NaCl in TA buffer. An aliquot (4 μl) of each 5-ml fraction was tested by gel mobility shift assays. The active fractions were pooled and supplemented with NaCl to make the conductivity equivalent to that of 100 mm NaCl in TA buffer. Active DEAE fractions were loaded onto a 50-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (XK 26, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl in TA buffer. The proteins were eluted in a 300-ml NaCl gradient (100 mmto 1 m) in TA buffer. Active fractions were concentrated using an Amicon YM-10 filter with a 10-kDa cutoff. The active heparin fraction was loaded on a 1-ml MonoQ column (HR5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SpbR activity was detected in the early fractions of a 60-ml NaCl gradient (100 mm to 1 m) in TA buffer. Fractions were stored in the elution buffer at 4 °C. pMF1, containing the region upstream of papR1 (nucleotides 113–435; accession number A37840), was digested with HindIII and end-labeled by filling in the overhanging ends with biotinylated dATP. The insert was released by cleavage with SmaI, purified (∼50 μg), and mixed with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The beads were incubated with the active MonoQ fractions (5 ml, ∼10 mg) for 30 min at room temperature and then separated using a magnet and sequentially washed with 2 ml of TA buffer supplemented with 50 mm NaCl. Nonspecific DNA-binding proteins were removed in washes using the same buffer containing 300 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC). The activity was eluted stepwise in TA buffer (10-ml aliquots) containing increasing NaCl concentrations (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.8, and 1 m). Apparent molecular mass was determined by column sizing chromatography (Superdex 200 SMART system) in comparison with protein molecular mass standards (thyroglobulin, 600 kDa; alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; and albumin, 45 kDa). Proteins were precipitated by the addition of 2 volumes of acetone, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (23Folcher M. Morris R. Dale G. Salah-Bey-Hochini K. Viollier P.H. Thompson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1479-1485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or two-dimensional protein gels (24Blondelet Rouault M.H. Weiser J. Lebrihi A. Branny P. Pernodet J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 190: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp.) by electroblotting in CAPS buffer (10 mm CAPS (pH 11) in 10% methanol). Proteins were visualized on the membrane by staining with a solution of 5% Ponceau S red in 10% acetic acid. The protein band was excised for N-terminal sequence analysis by Edman degradation. Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on N-terminal (MARQERAV) and internal (LTVFQGAL) sequences of the purified SpbR protein to PCR-amplify the 5′-region of the gene (forward primer, RTGGCSCGICAGGARCG; and reverse primer, STYSCGSGGGACGAGGTGSCASTC). A 350-bp PCR fragment generated using S. pristinaespiralisgenomic DNA as a template was cloned and sequenced. The predicted protein sequence had strong homology to the helix-turn-helix motif of bacterial transcriptional regulators belonging to the GABR family. This fragment was used to probe Southern blots of S. pristinaespiralis genomic DNA. A 4.1-kb hybridizing BclI band was subcloned into the BamHI site of pUC18 (pHG1). The spbR gene, along with flanking regions of 1.4 and 1.9 kb, was subcloned on an EcoRI/MscI fragment into the EcoRI/EcoRV sites of pUC21 (pNL4). The plasmid was cleaved at its unique MluI site in the spbR ORF, blunt-ended by T7 DNA polymerase, and ligated to a SmaI fragment containing an apramycin resistance gene cassette (aaC(3)IV) (24Blondelet Rouault M.H. Weiser J. Lebrihi A. Branny P. Pernodet J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 190: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Cleavage of this plasmid at sites in the adjacent polylinker (EcoRI/XbaI) released a fragment containing the disrupted spbR gene and allowed it to be subcloned into pSET151 (25Bierman M. Logan R. O'Brien K. Seno E.T. Rao R.N. Schoner B.E. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), a non-replicative plasmid that has the thiostrepton resistance marker. The construct (pNL6) was alkali-denatured and used to transform S. pristinaespiralisNRRL2958 protoplasts (21Oh S.H. Chater K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 122-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among 90 apramycin-resistant transformant colonies, only one was thiostrepton-sensitive (spbR25). To show by complementation in trans that the phenotypes observed were due to the disrupted spbR gene, a plasmid containing only spbR and its promoter was constructed. The spbR gene was removed from pHG1 by cleavage at BamHI (within insert)/EcoRI (vector) sites and ligated with pUC21 cleaved by the same enzymes. The fragment containing spbR was excised by BamHI and BglII (pUC21-encoded) and cloned into pIJ904 at the BamHI site (pNL5). A fragment containing the disrupted spbR gene and its flanking regions was cloned into a non-replicative plasmid (pSET151; construction described in the Fig. 2legend) with the selectable thiostrepton resistance marker. This plasmid (pNL4) was used to transform S. pristinaespiralis. Among 100 apramycin-resistant transformants, only one was thiostrepton-sensitive. Southern hybridization (see Fig. 2 B) showed that this clone (spbR25) contained the expected disruption of spbR resulting from a double crossover event. A low copy number plasmid containing the intact spbR gene (pNL5) (see Fig. 2 A) was able to restore this activity in trans. The coding region of the spbR gene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides NeuNT (5′-ACAACACATATGGCGCGGCAGGAGCGGG-3′) and NeuCT (5′-GGTAAGCTTTGGTGGGGTGGGTCAGT-3′). The amplified fragment was inserted into the NdeI/HindIII sites of the expression plasmid pDS56 (pHG2). pHG2 was used to transform E. coli M15 carrying a plasmid that supplies Lac repression (pRep4). This transformant was grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 25 mg/liter kanamycin. Synthesis of the protein was induced by the addition of 2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Purification of the recombinant protein was done according to the procedure used for the isolation of SpbR from Streptomyces cell extracts, omitting the DNA affinity chromatography step. An S. coelicolor homolog of spbR was isolated from genomic DNA. A PCR fragment was amplified using degenerate primers based on conserved amino acid motifs within the DNA-binding domains of GABR genes barA, arpA, and farA: ALYFHFA (SGCGAAGTGGAAGTASRRSGC) and AAAEVFDE (GCSGCSGCSGARGTSTTCGACGA). This 150-bp fragment was used as a hybridization probe to clone a 5-kb region of the locus. The sequence of the scbR ORF was later found to be identical to that recorded by E. Takano (accession number AJ007731) and by the Sanger Center S. coelicolor Genome Sequence Project (accession number AL132824http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_coelicolor/). The scbRgene was subcloned as a 5-kb BclI fragment into the BamHI site of pUC18 (pMF10). Crude cell extracts separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with rabbit anti-M. tuberculosis superoxide dismutase antibodies provided by M. A. Horwitz (UCLA) and then with swine peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. Crude cell extracts were also separated electrophoretically on nondenaturing acrylamide gels, and superoxide dismutase was stained in situ (26Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). Digested genomic DNAs were separated on 1% agarose gels, transferred by vacuum blotting to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond N+ Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed by Southern hybridization under standard conditions (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 74-82Google Scholar) or under low stringency (0.2× SSC and 0.5% SDS at room temperature). PCRs were carried out using 100 pmol of primer, buffer supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and a Protocol Thermocycler (AMS Biotechnology). Standard hot-start PCR and touchdown PCR were performed in the presence of 10% Me2SO. The P papR1 fragment was removed from pMF1 by HindIII/SmaI digestion and end-labeled by filling in the HindIII overhang with [α-32P]dATP. The probe was incubated with a saturating amount of purified SpbR (determined by gel retardation assay) in the presence of 4 μg of competitor DNA (poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC)) and 0.5 units of DNase I. The digestion products were resolved on a 6% sequencing gel. Secondary metabolites in the media were extracted in ethyl acetate, resolubilized in Me2SO, and assayed directly for antibiotic activity (pristinamycin) or separated by HPLC. The disc antibiotic assay utilized B. subtilis ATCC6633 growing on NE agar as an indicator lawn. To identify individual components of the pristinamycin complex, ethyl acetate extracts were applied to a reverse-phase column (μrpc c2/c18Sc2,1/1.0 SMART, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted in a linear gradient of H2O and acetonitrile. Fractions were assayed for compounds that inhibited SpbR DNA-binding activity. Protein content was measured using a kit supplied by Bio-Rad with bovine serum albumin as a standard. papR1, encoding a protein (284 amino acids) homologous to the SARP family, was identified in the course of sequencing the pristinamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (nucleotides 431–1283; accession number A37840). BLASTP protein data base searches showed that PapR1 has the highest similarity (73% identity) to TylS and significant matches with a family of SARPs required for expression of various Streptomyces antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters, including DrrR1 (56% identity; daunomycin), MtmR (45% identity; mithramycin), and ActII-ORF4 (37% identity; actinorhodin). Other SARPs tested have proven to be essential for antibiotic biosynthesis; gene disruption of papR1 reduced both PI and PII yields by only 30%. 2K. T. Nguyen, L. T. Nguyen, P. Lacroix, N. Bamas-Jacques, and C. J. Thompson, unpublished data. This may reflect the activity of a second SARP gene recently identified in the pristinamycin gene cluster.2 We assumed that these redundant (papR2) genes were involved in the control of pristinamycin biosynthesis, and studies of papR1 might identify higher level regulators coordinating synthesis of PI and PII with developmental signals. Interestingly, visual inspection of the sequence upstream of the papR1 transcriptional start site identified a potential ARE (see below). Samples of a growing culture (Fig.3 A) were assayed for pristinamycin biosynthesis as well as for proteins that potentially regulate the papR1 promoter (P papR1) (Fig.3 B). Bioassays showed that pristinamycin antibiotic activity accumulated in the medium beginning shortly after the maximum mycelial mass was attained (40–100 h) (Fig. 3 A). Gel retardation assays using a fragment encoding the papR1 promoter region (P papR1) detected a potential GABR transcriptional regulatory protein (SpbR) in crude cytoplasmic extracts prepared from these cultures. P papR1 gel shift activity, not detected in growing cultures (Fig. 3 B), increased shortly after the cultures entered stationary phase, coincident with the activation of pristinamycin biosynthesis (Fig. 3 A). SpbR was enriched from crude extract (7 g of protein) of stationary phase mycelia (100 g) using sequential DEAE, heparin, and MonoQ ion-exchange columns (see “Experimental Procedures”). The final step of the purification employed biotinylated P papR1 fragment fixed to streptavidin-coated beads (23Folcher M. Morris R. Dale G. Salah-Bey-Hochini K. Viollier P.H. Thompson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1479-1485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2574) Google Scholar), an important group of starch-converting enzymes. Catalysis in the α -amylase family proceeds via a covalently linked intermediate (2Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), which basically divides the reaction in two steps. In the first step the donor substrate (starch or oligosaccharide) is processed, yielding the covalent intermediate (donor reaction). In the second step the acceptor reacts with this intermediate, resulting in product formation (acceptor reaction). Whereas α -amylases usually catalyze a hydrolysis reaction using water as acceptor, CGTases mainly catalyze transglycosylation reactions in which the acceptor is either the non-reducing end glucose of another oligosaccharide (disproportionation) or the non-reducing end glucose of the covalently linked oligosaccharide intermediate, resulting in formation of a cyclodextrin (cyclization). Also the reverse of the cyclization, in which a cyclodextrin is cleaved and transferred to an accepting oligosaccharide (coupling), is catalyzed by CGTase (3van der Veen B.A. van Alebeek G.J.W.M.

In the maltononaose structures the glucose residue at subsite +1 has hydrogen-bonding interactions with His-233, similar to those in Aspergillus oryzae α -amylase complexed with an acarbose-derived maltohexaose inhibitor (6Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). At subsite +2 hydrogen-bonding interactions also occur in both enzymes (with Lys-232; CGTase numbering) (Fig.1 a ). In CGTase the +2 sugar residue is, in addition, sandwiched between phenylalanines 183 and 259 (see Fig. 1). These residues are well conserved in CGTases but not in α -amylases, where only Leu-232 (equivalent to Phe-259 in CGTase) has hydrophobic interactions with this glucose residue (6Brzozowski A.M. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10837-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The two aromatic residues have been shown to be important for the cyclization reaction (7Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9929-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but their specific functions have remained unclear. Finally, a +3 acceptor subsite has been identified in the CGTase fromThermoanaerobacter thermosulfurogenes strain EM1, in which Glu-265 (Glu-264 in the B. circulans CGTase) is involved (8Wind R.D. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Buitelaar R.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5771-5779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 a). The above structural studies have given insights in the binding mode of linear oligosaccharides. A crystal structure of the B. circulans strain 251 CGTase in complex with a γ -cyclodextrin (9Uitdehaag J.C.M. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34868-34876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) revealed specific differences between the binding mode of linear and cyclic compounds. The glucose residue bound at subsite +1 has similar interactions in both cases, but the bound cyclodextrin has no hydrogen-bonding interactions at subsites +2 and +3 (Fig.1 b). The hydrophobic interactions with Phe-183 and Phe-259 are also different. Phe-183 has better stacking interactions with the linear compounds, whereas for Phe-259 these interactions are better with the cyclodextrin (Fig. 1). These different interactions suggest that the residues involved may have different roles in the various reactions catalyzed by CGTase. We have investigated this by site-directed mutagenesis and detailed characterization of the mutant enzymes. Our study indeed shows that the various residues have distinct roles, dependent on whether disproportionation, cyclization, or coupling reactions take place.

CGTase (mutant) proteins were produced with the α-amylase- and protease-negative Bacillus subtilis strain DB104A (amy nprR2 nprE18 aprA3) (12Smith H. de Jong A. Bron S. Venema G.

Plasmid pBluescript KSII (Stratagene) was used for automated sequencing. DNA manipulations and calcium chloride transformation of E. colistrains were performed as described (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Transformation of B. subtilis was performed according to Bron (16Bron S. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Modern Microbiological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 146-147Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced with a PCR method using VENT-DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) (13Penninga D. van der Veen B.A. Knegtel R.M.A. van Hijum S.A.F.T. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32777-32784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A first PCR reaction was carried out with a mutagenesis primer for the coding strand plus a primer downstream on the template strand. The reaction product was subsequently used as primer in a second PCR reaction, together with a primer upstream on the coding strand. For the construction of Phe-183/Phe-259 double mutants the reaction product of the first PCR with the mutagenesis primer for Phe-259 mutations was used as primer in a second PCR reaction, together with the mutagenesis primer for Phe-183 mutations. This reaction product was subsequently used as primer in a third PCR reaction, together with a primer upstream on the coding strand. The products of the PCR reactions (1360 base pairs) were cut withPvuII and SalI, and the resulting fragments (1210 base pairs) were exchanged with the corresponding fragment from the vector pDP66K. The resulting (mutant) plasmids were transformed toE. coli MC1061 cells. The following oligonucleotide was used to construct the Lys-232 mutations: 5′-C ATG GAT GCA GTA CWG CAC ATG CCG-3′. The underlined cytosine is a replacement for the original thymine, resulting in removal of a NdeI site (CATATG). W can be an adenine or a thymine. An adenine results in the K232Q mutation; a thymine results in the K232L mutation and introduction of a ScaI site (AGTACT). For the construction of mutant E264A the primer 5′-C CTG GGC GTT AAC GCA GTG AGC CCG-3′ was used, resulting in introduction of a HpaI site (GTTAAC). Oligonucleotides used to construct the phenylalanine mutations were as follows: for F183I, Thr, Asn, or Ser, 5′-GGC GGT ACC GAC ANT TCC ACG ACC-3′, containing a KpnI site (GGTACC); for F259I, Thr, Asn, or Ser, 5′-GGC GAA TGG ANC CTA GGC GTA AAT GAA-3′, containing an AvrII site (CCTAGG).N can be any of the four bases, resulting in identical mutations with both primers. An adenine results in the Phe → Asn mutation, a cytosine in the Phe → Thr mutation, a guanine in the Phe → Ser mutation, and a thymine in the Phe → Ile mutation. The built in restriction sites allowed rapid screening of potential mutants. A mutation frequency close to 70% was observed; all mutations were confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. Plasmids pDP66K carrying the correct restriction sites were cut with EcoRI and ApaI and with ApaI and SalI. The resulting fragments were cloned in the multiple cloning site of plasmid pBluescript, and the resulting plasmids transformed to E. coli DH5α cells. Dideoxy sequencing reactions were done using T7 DNA polymerase, with either 5′-end-labeled primers or with unlabeled primers and fluorescein-labeled ATP (17Voss H. Schwager C. Wirkner U. Zimmermann J. Erfle H. Hewitt N. Rupp T. Stegemann J. Ansorge W. Methods Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 3: 30-34Google Scholar, 18Zimmermann J. Voss H. Schwager C. Stegemann J. Erfle H. Stucky K. Kristensen T. Ansorge W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing was done with the automated laser fluorescent DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The nucleotide sequence data were compiled and analyzed using the programs supplied in the PC/GENE software package (Intelligenetics). Plasmid-carrying bacterial strains were grown on LB agar in the presence of the antibiotic kanamycin at concentrations of 100 and 5 μg/ml for E. coli and B. subtilis, respectively (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Agar plates also contained 1.5% potato starch (Sigma) for the detection of CGTase secretion by the bacteria. CGTase activity is visible on these plates by the precipitation of (β-) cyclodextrins, resulting in halo formation. B. subtilis strain DB104A with plasmid pDP66K, carrying wild type or mutant cgt genes, was grown for 24 h in a 2-liter fermentor, containing 1.5 liters of medium with 2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% sodium chloride, 1% casamino acids (pH 7.0) with 10 μg/ml erythromycin and 5 μg/ml kanamycin, to a final optical density at 600 nm of ∼12. Under these conditions high extracellular CGTase levels were obtained reproducibly, allowing purification to homogeneity of up to 25 mg of CGTase protein per liter. The culture was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The (mutant) CGTases in the culture supernatants were further purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography, using a 30-ml α-cyclodextrin-Sepharose-6FF column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (19Sundberg L. Porath J. J. Chromatogr. 1974; 90: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) with a maximal capacity of 3.5 mg of protein per ml. After washing with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), bound CGTase was eluted with the same buffer containing 10 mg/ml α-cyclodextrin. For all assays and enzyme dilutions a 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 6) was used. All incubations were carried out at 50 °C. β-Cyclodextrin-forming activity was determined by incubating appropriately diluted enzyme (0.1–0.2 units of activity) for 2–4 min with a 5% solution of partially hydrolyzed potato starch with an average degree of polymerization of 50 (Paselli SA2; AVEBE, Foxhol, The Netherlands) preincubated at 50 °C for 10 min. At regular time intervals samples were taken, and the amount of β-cyclodextrin formed was determined based on its ability to form a stable colorless inclusion complex with phenolphthalein (20Vikmon M. Szejtli J. First International Symposium on Cyclodextrins. D. Reidel Publishing, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1982: 69-74Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme able to produce 1 μmol of β-cyclodextrin per min. The coupling activity was determined as described by van der Veenet al. (3van der Veen B.A. van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures containing cyclodextrin and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (66940; Fluka) were incubated for 10 min at 50 °C before the reaction was started with appropriately diluted CGTase. At regular time intervals (0.25 min) 100-μl samples were taken, and the CGTase was inactivated. The linear products were converted to glucose residues through the action of amyloglucosidase (EC 3.2.1.3, A-3514; Sigma). The glucose concentration was determined with the glucose/GOD-Perid method (124036; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme coupling 1 μmol of cyclodextrin to methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside per min. The disproportionation activity was measured using the method according to van der Veen et al. (3van der Veen B.A. van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained up to 6 mm4-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoheptaoside-4–6-O-ethylidene (EPS, 1 492 977; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a maltoheptasaccharide blocked at the non-reducing end and with a para-nitrophenyl group at its reducing end as donor and up to 10 mm maltose (Fluka 63418) as acceptor. After 10 min of preincubation at 50 °C the reaction was started with appropriately diluted CGTase. At regular time intervals (0.25 min) 100-μl samples were taken, and the CGTase was inactivated. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with α-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20, 1630385; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to liberate paranitrophenol from the product of the disproportionation reaction, non-blocked linear oligosaccharide. After addition of 1 ml of 1 m sodium carbonate the absorbance of the samples was measured at 401 nm (ε401 = 18.4 mm−1). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme converting 1 μmol of EPS per min. The hydrolyzing activity was determined as described before (21Penninga D. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Lawson C.L. Dijkstra B.W. Bergsma J. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of a 1% soluble starch (Lamers & Pleuger) solution, preincubated at 50 °C for 10 min, upon addition of CGTase was followed by measuring the increase in reducing power (22Bernfeld P. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (3413) Google Scholar). One unit of saccharifying activity was defined as the amount of enzyme producing 1 μmol of reducing sugar per min. Kinetic analysis of the two substrate reactions (coupling and disproportionation) was performed with SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). The following equations (23Cornish-Bowden A. CornishBowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press, London1995Google Scholar) were used to fit the experimental data to determine which kinetic mechanism applies to the transglycosylation reactions catalyzed by CGTase the substituted-enzyme mechanism, represented by Equation 1:v=V·a·b/(KMB·a+KMA·b+a·b)Eq. 1 the substituted-enzyme mechanism with substrate inhibition, represented by Equation 2:v=V·a·b/(KMB·a+KMA·b·(1+b/KiB)+a·b)Eq. 2 or through the ternary complex mechanism, represented by Equation 3:v=V·a·b/(KMA′·KMB+KMB·a+KMA·b+a·b)Eq. 3 where v is the reaction rate, V is the maximal reaction rate, a and b are the donor and acceptor substrate concentrations, respectively, A andB are the donor and acceptor substrates, respectively, andKM and K′M are the affinity constants for the substrates in the absence and presence of the second substrate, respectively.K′MB is lost in the derivation of Equation 2, but it can easily be determined, becauseKMA /KMB =K′MA /K′MB . Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Several variants of residues 183, 232, 259, and 264 were obtained. A first screening on starch-containing agar plates revealed halo formation by all single mutants, indicating the production of β-cyclodextrin by the mutant CGTases. In contrast, several double mutants of residues 183 and 259 were incapable of halo formation. DNA sequencing of various selected clones resulted in the identification of the following CGTase mutants: F183N, F183S, K232L, K232Q, E264A, F259N, and F259S and the double mutant F183S/F259N. The β-cyclization activities of the wild type and mutant CGTase enzymes are shown in Table I. Changing hydrogen-bonding interactions at subsite +2 (Lys-232 mutants) clearly resulted in decreased cyclization activity, especially with mutant K232Q. Likewise, substitution of Phe-183 and Phe-259 by hydrophilic residues strongly reduced cyclization activity. Of the single mutants F183N and F183S showed the highest reduction in cyclization activity (10- and 20-fold). The double mutant F183S/F259N showed even a 300-fold decrease in cyclization activity, suggesting a synergistic action of the two phenylalanine residues. In contrast, in the subsite +3 mutant E264A the cyclization activity was hardly affected.Table Iβ-Cyclization and hydrolyzing activities of wild type and mutant CGTases(Mutant) enzymeβ-CyclizationStarch hydrolysisunits/mgWild type270.0 ± 1.73.2 ± 0.2K232L122.9 ± 6.5ND1-aND, not determined.K232Q69.2 ± 3.5NDF183N25.4 ± 1.710.6 ± 0.4F183S14.8 ± 1.28.8 ± 0.3F259N41.7 ± 0.260.3 ± 1.7F259S42.0 ± 1.832.6 ± 1.0E264A215.8 ± 11.9NDF183S/F259N0.9 ± 0.114.3 ± 1.41-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The specific starch hydrolyzing activities of the (mutant) enzymes are listed in Table I. Especially the Phe-259 mutants showed a significant increase in hydrolysis (10- to 20-fold), whereas mutation of Phe-183 resulted in a 3-fold increase. Starch hydrolysis by the double mutant F183S/F259N was intermediate compared with the single F183S and F259N mutants. For further characterization of the acceptor site, the disproportionation reaction was analyzed (see Fig.2 and Table II). All mutations resulted in decreased disproportionation activities. For the Lys-232 mutants and mutant F259N this reduction in activity was comparable with that in the cyclization activity, suggesting similar roles for these residues in the two reactions. Mutations F183N and F183S, however, showed only 2- and 5-fold reductions in disproportionation activity (compared with 10- and 20-fold reductions in cyclization activity, respectively), suggesting that this residue has a more significant role in cyclization. As for the cyclization reaction, the double mutant F183S/F259N gave a much larger reduction in disproportionation activity (75-fold) than would be expected from a combination of the single mutants. The results thus suggest also a synergistic action of the two phenylalanine residues in the disproportionation reaction. Finally, at subsite +3, mutant E264A showed a 2-fold reduction in disproportionation activity, indicating that this subsite, although somewhat remote from the catalytic site, contributes to this reaction. Surprisingly, all mutations, even the one at subsite +3, resulted in decreased Km values for maltose and thus increased affinities. Furthermore, Fig. 2 a clearly indicates substrate inhibition exerted by the acceptor substrate (maltose), which may be a direct effect of the increased affinities. Although the parallel lines in the Lineweaver-Burke plot for the wild type enzyme (see Fig.2 b, inset) indicate a normal ping-pong type of kinetics, represented by Equation 1, the experimental data of the mutants could best be fitted by Equation 2, resulting in the inhibition constants listed in Table II. The substrate inhibition by maltose was most pronounced for mutant F183N (shown in Fig. 2), although this mutant did not give the highest increase in affinity for maltose.Table IIKinetic parameters of the disproportionation reaction of wild type and mutant CGTases(Mutant) enzymeVmaxKMEPSKMMalKiMalunits/mgmmmmmmWild type970.0 ± 17.60.22 ± 0.020.83 ± 0.05ND2-aND, not detectable.K232L627.3 ± 15.60.29 ± 0.020.42 ± 0.034.7 ± 0.7K232Q303.3 ± 11.90.39 ± 0.040.29 ± 0.036.5 ± 1.5F183N556.3 ± 16.00.26 ± 0.020.31 ± 0.021.3 ± 0.2F183S170.3 ± 4.00.27 ± 0.030.27 ± 0.026.0 ± 1.3F259N189.2 ± 4.20.10 ± 0.010.14 ± 0.014.9 ± 1.1E264A520.6 ± 10.60.11 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.015.1 ± 1.1F183S/F259N13.7 ± 0.90.70 ± 0.060.01 ± 0.082.1 ± 0.3Mal, maltose.2-a ND, not detectable.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the effects of the mutations on β-cyclodextran coupling were analyzed (TableIII). Drastically decreased coupling activities were observed with the Phe-183 mutants, suggesting an important role for this residue in the coupling reaction. The Phe-259 and Lys-232 mutants were more significantly affected in their substrate affinities, suggesting that these residues are more specifically involved in the formation of the ternary complex.Table IIIKinetic parameters of the β-coupling reaction of wild type and mutant CGTases(Mutant) enzymeVmaxKMCDKMACCK′MCDK′MACCunits/mgmmmmmmmmWild type294.0 ± 7.60.32 ± 0.0218.1 ± 1.40.15 ± 0.048.5 ± 2.2K232L213.9 ± 15.60.47 ± 0.0244.8 ± 4.30.35 ± 0.0233.6 ± 4.3K232Q84.8 ± 15.60.49 ± 0.0260.6 ± 4.30.32 ± 0.0239.4 ± 4.3F183N1.6 ± 0.060.15 ± 0.026.2 ± 0.90.13 ± 0.075.1 ± 0.8F183S1.0 ± 0.030.41 ± 0.064.7 ± 0.60.43 ± 0.034.9 ± 0.5F259N117.0 ± 6.20.38 ± 0.0417.7 ± 2.10.49 ± 0.0522.6 ± 2.0F259S239.0 ± 15.20.54 ± 0.0579.5 ± 7.10.29 ± 0.0342.1 ± 4.0E264A282.7 ± 15.60.24 ± 0.0217.8 ± 4.30.12 ± 0.028.7 ± 4.3F183S/F259N≪1NDNDNDNDCD, cyclodextrin; ACC, acceptor.aND, not determined.

Previously, structural and biochemical studies of CGTase had already provided evidence for the importance of His-233 in the +1 acceptor binding subsite for catalysis (24Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6624-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here we concentrate on subsites +2 and +3, more distant from the catalytic site. Our results show that Phe-183, Lys-232, and Phe-259, which interact with substrates and/or products at subsite +2, are involved in all CGTase catalyzed transglycosylation reactions, whereas Glu-264 at subsite +3 is only involved in the disproportionation reaction. Mutations in Lys-232 resulted in similar decreases in activity for all CGTase-catalyzed transglycosylation reactions, suggesting a general importance. Mutants K232Q and K232L have still appreciable activity, indicating that the polar headgroup of Lys-232 is not directly involved in catalysis. In contrast, reduction of the hydrophobisity of this residue (K232Q) results in more severely decreased activities than when the hydrophobic nature of the Lys-232 side chain is maintained (K232L). Lys-232 is situated in the loop following β-strand 3, which also contains the catalytic nucleophile Asp-229 and the His-233 residue. The apolar part of its aliphatic side chain has hydrophobic interactions with Trp-258, a residue completely conserved in CGTases that neighbors the acid/base catalyst Glu-257 in the loop following β-strand 4. Lys-232 thus appears to be important for structural integrity of the active site. Replacement of phenylalanines 183 and 259 by hydrophilic residues resulted in increased hydrolyzing activities and reduced transglycosylation activities. The physiological function of CGTase is to produce cyclodextrins and not short, linear oligosaccharides that can be utilized by competing organisms in the natural environment. Therefore, hydrolysis of the substrate should be prevented, which CGTase accomplishes by excluding water from the active site and making use of an intricate induced-fit mechanism (25Uitdehaag J.C.M. van Alebeek G.J.W.M. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7772-7780Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 2H. Leemhuis, J. C. M. Uitdehaag, B. W. Dijkstra, and L. Dijkhuizen (2001) J. Biol. Chem., submitted for publication. The introduction of hydrophilic residues near the catalytic site reduces the hydrophobic character of the active site and may favor the presence of water molecules that can react with the intermediate, as shown by the increased hydrolyzing activities of the Phe-183 and Phe-259 mutants. Indeed, combination of the two mutants even resulted in an enzyme that significantly prefers hydrolysis over cyclization (15:1), whereas the wild type favors cyclization over hydrolysis (90:1). The cyclization reaction requires a conformational change of the covalently linked oligosaccharide, producing a circular product from a linear substrate (circularization). Mutations of Phe-183 result in a larger decrease of the cyclization activity than those of Phe-259, suggesting a more important role for Phe-183. Crystal structures, however, show that Phe-259 has ideal stacking interactions with cyclodextrins at subsite +2 (9Uitdehaag J.C.M. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34868-34876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whereas for Phe-183 these interactions are better with linear substrates (2Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Reaction path calculations on CGTase reconcile these apparently conflicting results (26Uitdehaag J.C.M. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Elber R. Dijkstra B.W. Proteins. 2001; 43: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These calculations showed that Phe-183 is actively involved in the circularization process of linear oligosaccharides, whereas Phe-259 only comes into play at the end of this process, interacting with the non-reducing end sugars of the circularized covalent intermediate bound at the acceptor binding subsites. Our kinetic data on the mutant enzymes presented in this study substantiate now show for the first time that the two phenylalanine residues at subsite +2 affect the cyclization activity differentially. In addition, the loss of virtually all cyclization activity of the double F183S/F259N mutant supports an additive, consecutive action of the two subsite +2 phenylalanines. The disproportionation reaction operates via a ping-pong mechanism in which the processing of the first (donor) substrate is followed by binding of the second (acceptor) substrate (3van der Veen B.A. van Alebeek G.J.W.M.

All mutations in the acceptor binding sites described here, including the E264A mutation at subsite +3, resulted in substrate inhibition exerted by maltose, whereas in the wild type enzyme no inhibitory effect of maltose on the binding of EPS is observed. This indicates that the CGTase active site is perfectly suited for the successive binding of donor and acceptor, in which subsite +3 also plays an important role. We propose that in the wild type enzyme a maltose can bind either at subsites +2 and +3 (Fig. 3 a) or at +1 and +2 (Fig. 3 b). The lack of substrate inhibition in the wild type enzyme, even at high maltose concentrations, indicates that the presence of the acceptor maltose does not affect binding of the donor EPS. The distribution of bound maltose over subsites +1/+2 and +2/+3 apparently facilitates exchange of this maltose for the donor substrate in such a way that no inhibitory effect of maltose is observed. Mutation of the acceptor site affects this distribution by changing the affinity for maltose, resulting in inhibition of the binding of the donor substrate by the acceptor substrate. This dual binding mode of maltose also explains the effects of the Phe-183 and Phe-259 mutations on the Vmax of the disproportionation activity. Whereas for Phe-259 these effects are similar to those on the cyclization activity, for Phe-183 they are less pronounced and for F183N they are comparable with the effects of the E264A mutant. This suggests that Phe-183 is more specifically involved in the binding of maltose at subsites +2 and +3, which also involves interactions with Glu-264, whereas Phe-259 is more involved in the binding of maltose at subsites +1 and +2 required for catalysis. Thus, whereas Phe-183, together with Glu-264, provides an initial docking site for the acceptor maltose, Phe-259 serves to put the maltose in a (cyclodextrin-like) position suitable for catalysis. As for the cyclization reaction, this successive action of the subsite +2 phenylalanines explains why the double mutant F183S/F259N, in which both acceptor binding steps are affected, resulted in a very large decrease of the disproportionation activity. The kinetic mechanism of the coupling reaction proceeds via a ternary complex, in which the cyclodextrin (donor) and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (acceptor) bind simultaneously in the active site (3van der Veen B.A. van Alebeek G.J.W.M. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that all mutated residues at subsite +2 affect the coupling reaction, whereas Glu-264 at subsite +3 does not. The data suggest that especially acceptor binding in the ternary complex is affected; for the Lys-232 mutants the affinity for the acceptor has decreased more than that for β-cyclodextrin, and for the Phe-183 mutants the coupling activity has decreased much more than the cyclization activity. Because the difference between the coupling and cyclization reaction is the formation of the ternary complex, this latter observation indicates the importance of Phe-183 for binding of the acceptor in the ternary complex, beside its role in the conformational change of the oligosaccharide (see above). In contrast, Phe-259 contributes to a lesser extent to the coupling reaction. In conclusion, the hydrolyzing activity of CGTase is limited by the hydrophobicity of Phe-183 and Phe-259, as shown by the increased hydrolysis resulting from the replacement of these residues by hydrophilic ones. Furthermore, Phe-183 and Phe-259 have specific roles in the transglycosylation reactions catalyzed by CGTase. The current results support the action of these residues in the cyclization reaction as visualized by reaction path calculations; Phe-183 is most important for cyclization because of its intimate involvement in the 23Å relocation of the non-reducing end glucose of the covalently linked intermediate. In the disproportionation reaction, Phe-183, together with Glu-264, provides a docking site for the acceptor (maltose) at subsites +2 and +3. Thus, in both the disproportionation and the cyclization reactions, Phe-183 is involved in initial binding of the acceptor glucose residues. Phe-259, which specifically binds oligosaccharides in a “cyclodextrin” conformation, is required for final interactions resulting in catalysis. By combining rational design and (semi) random mutagenesis we were able to select a double mutant (F183S/F259N) that significantly prefers hydrolysis over cyclization (15:1), whereas the wild type favors cyclization over hydrolysis (90:1). This shows that it is possible to specifically enhance one reaction over the other by site-directed mutagenesis of CGTase."

We show that dephosphorylation of NFATc1, MEF2A, and MEF2D transcription factors by calcineurin in all muscle types is dependent on nerve activity and positively correlated with muscle usage under normal weightbearing conditions. With increased nerve-mediated activity, calcineurin dephosphorylation of these targets was found to be potentiated in a way that paralleled the higher muscle activation profiles associated with functional overload or nerve electrical stimulation conditions. We also establish that muscle activity must be sustained above native levels for calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of MEF2A and MEF2D to be transduced into an increase in MEF2 transcriptional function, suggesting that calcineurin cooperates with other activity-linked events to signal via these proteins. Finally, examination of individual fiber responses to overload and nerve electrical stimulation revealed that calcineurin-MEF2 signaling occurs in all fiber types but most readily in fibers that are normally least active (i.e.those expressing IIx and IIb myosin heavy chain (MHC)), suggesting that signaling via this phosphatase is also dependent upon the activation history of the muscle cell.

Slow/type I fibers display relatively small diameters and express slow isoforms of myofibrillar and Ca2+-regulatory proteins, whereas fast/type II fibers generally display larger fiber girths and express faster isoforms of these proteins (see Ref. 1Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar for review). The phenotype of an adult muscle fiber is malleable and is largely influenced by the amount and pattern of activity that it receives from its motor nerve (1Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence of this is provided by studies that have induced transformations in muscle phenotype by cross-reinnervating slow or fast muscles with their foreign nerve counterparts or by electrically stimulating these muscles with impulse patterns modeled after foreign nerve discharges (see Ref. 1Schiaffino S. Reggiani C. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 371-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar for review). For example, electrical stimulation of a fast twitch muscle with low frequency continuous stimuli, a pattern that mimics the activity of slow motoneurons (2Hennig R. Lomo T. Nature. 1985; 314: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), causes this muscle to express slower, more energy-efficient contractile proteins and to become more fatigue-resistant (3Pette D.

On the other hand, sporadic, high frequency stimulus trains associated with fast motoneuron firing (2Hennig R. Lomo T. Nature. 1985; 314: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) induce the expression of faster, more metabolically costly, contractile proteins in predominantly slow twitch muscles (5Dunn S.E.

Physiol. 1988; 402: 651-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Acetylcholine is released from the nerve terminal with each motoneuron discharge. The binding of this neurotransmitter to receptor-mediated ion channels on the target muscle cell induces a depolarization of the sarcolemma and triggers the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is suggested that as a result of their distinct discharge profiles, slow and fast motoneurons modulate the expression of muscle genes via the different patterns of intracellular Ca2+ that they evoke (7Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Frequent muscle depolarizations elicited in response to the tonic activity of slow motoneurons induce a sustained elevation of muscle Ca2+ (8Chin E.R. Allen D.G. Physiologist. 1996; 39: A-75Google Scholar), whereas the infrequent, burst firing of fast motoneurons evokes transient spikes in muscle Ca2+ (9Westerblad H. Allen D.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Calcineurin, a Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-activated1phosphatase, has been implicated as a molecular decoder of sustained Ca2+ signals evoked in muscle cells in response to frequent nerve-mediated depolarizations and as an integral signaling intermediate in pathways that promote skeletal muscle fiber hypertrophy and expression of a slower contractile protein phenotype (for review, see Ref. 10Olson E.N. Williams R.S. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It is postulated that nerve-mediated increases in muscle intracellular Ca2+activate calcineurin and CaM-sensitive kinases which in turn trigger the action of nuclear factor ofactivated T cells c1 (NFATc1) andmyocyte enhancer factor2 (MEF2) proteins (7Chin E.R.

It is thought that these proteins bind cooperatively with other transcription factors such as GATA-2 to activate the transcription of slow fiber-specific or growth-regulatory genes (7Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 10Olson E.N.

In support of this model, increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels in cultured myocytes with ionomycin activates calcineurin (12Abbott K.L. Friday B.B. Thaloor D. Murphy T.J. Pavlath G.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2905-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13MeiBner J.D. Gros G. Scheibe R.J. Scholz M. Kubis H.-P. J.

A. 1997; 94: 4205-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, NFAT and MEF2 binding appears essential for the calcineurin-dependent activation and slow fiber-specific expression of the slow upstream regulatory element enhancer, a transcriptional element that directs the expression of the troponin I slow gene (11Wu H. Naya F.J. McKinsey T.A. Mercer B. Shelton J.M. Chin E.R. Simard A.R. Michel R.N. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The clear importance of calcineurin signaling events in regulating muscle phenotype is further demonstrated by experiments that prevented fiber growth and fast-to-slow fiber type transitions (i.e. IIb → IIx → IIa → I) in the overloaded (OV) plantaris (15Dunn S.E. Burns J.L. Michel R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21908-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and induced a subtle atrophy and shift toward expression of faster contractile proteins in the normal weightbearing soleus (7Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 16Bigard X.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19653-19660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), by administration of the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) or FK506. Although the importance of Ca2+ and calcineurin-dependent signaling pathways in regulating fiber phenotype is established, the role of nerve-mediated activity as an in vivo upstream modulator of calcineurin activity in skeletal muscles has yet to be confirmed. In the present study, we thus tested the hypothesis that calcineurin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle cells are sensitive to nerve-mediated activity. To this end, we investigated whether calcineurin is more extensively activated in more highly recruited muscles under normal weightbearing conditions and whether this activity is countered by neuronal quiescence. Next, we examined the potentiation of calcineurin signaling in overloaded plantaris muscles over the time course when motor unit recruitment levels are rapidly doubled by this condition (17Gardiner P. Michel R.N. Browman C. Noble E. Brain Res. 1986; 380: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, to provide insight into what specific aspect of the nerve electrical stimulus (i.e. pulse frequency, amount, etc.) is key to activating calcineurin in muscle cells, we contrasted the effectiveness of various exogenous nerve stimulation paradigms to initiate signaling via this enzyme. The extent of muscle calcineurin signaling was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation status of the calcineurin substrates NFATc1, MEF2A, and MEF2D; the nuclear abundance of NFATc1; and the transcriptional function of MEF2. Consistent with our hypothesis, we show calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of NFATc1, MEF2A, and MEF2D to be nerve activity-dependent and to occur in all muscle types. Dephosphorylation of these transcription factors by calcineurin appeared to be positively correlated with muscle usage under normal weightbearing conditions. Moreover, we provide evidence that muscle activity must be increased above native levels for calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of MEF2A or MEF2D to be transduced into an increase in transcriptional function of these proteins, suggesting that accessory activity-linked signaling events are required for complete signaling of calcineurin to target genes (18Dunn S.E. Chin E.R. Michel R.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Finally, we found that calcineurin-MEF2 signaling was initiated in all muscle fiber types in response to increased nerve-mediated activity, but occurred most readily in the least active fibers, those expressing IIx or IIb MHC, suggesting that modulation of this pathway is also influenced by the activation history of each muscle cell. Sprague-Dawley rats (260–300 g) and CD-1 mice (25–35 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada). Tg mice (C57BL6) harboring lacZ under the control of three copies of a high affinity desmin MEF2 consensus element (desMEF2) have been described previously (19Naya F.J. Wu C. Richardson J.A. Overbeek P. Olson E.N. Development. 1999; 126: 2045-2052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All surgical procedures were performed under aseptic conditions on animals anesthetized by intramuscular injection (1.2 μl/g) of 100 mg/ml ketamine hydrochloride and 10 mg/ml xylazine in a volume ratio of 1.6:1. Treatment of animals was in accordance with the guidelines established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. For denervation and TTX paralysis experiments, hamstring musculature in the left hip region of rats was incised to expose the sciatic nerve. In denervated animals, a 5-mm portion of the sciatic nerve was excised. In TTX animals, muscles in the left hindlimb were paralyzed for 3 or 7 days by chronic superfusion of the sciatic nerve (0.5 μl/h) with this sodium channel blocker (350 μg/μl) via a mini-osmotic pump (model 1007D, Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA) and attached silicon drug delivery system as described in detail previously (5Dunn S.E. Michel R.N. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 432-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, a silicon cuff was secured around the nerve and was connected by silicon tubing to the pump that was implanted subcutaneously on the animal's back. The efficacy of paralysis of the triceps surae muscles in TTX animals was verified twice daily using established ankle reflex criteria (5Dunn S.E. Michel R.N. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 432-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Control rats were implanted with a sham nerve cuff and drug delivery system. For OV experiments, compensatory hypertrophy of the plantaris was induced in each hindlimb of desMEF2 Tg and CD-1 mice by surgically ablating the soleus and a major portion of the gastrocnemius muscle (15Dunn S.E. Burns J.L. Michel R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21908-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In control mice, the tendons of the soleus and gastrocnemius were separated from the plantaris tendon but were not severed. For muscle regeneration experiments, local injury of the plantaris in each hindlimb of CD-1 mice was induced via freezing the muscle. Briefly, the medial hamstring musculature was incised to expose the distal half of the plantaris. Metal forceps (2 mm in width) pre-cooled with liquid nitrogen were then applied to the surface of the muscle for 10 s. For electrical stimulation experiments, hamstring musculature in the left hip region of each animal was incised to expose the sciatic nerve. Hindlimb muscles were activated by electrically stimulating the sciatic nerve at supramaximal voltage (15 V) with a bipolar electrode using a 10-Hz continuous or an intermittent 100-Hz stimulus pattern (Grass® Stimulator, model S48, Grass Instrument, Quincy, MA). For the latter pattern, 1-s 100-Hz trains were administered once every 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 15 min, or 30 min. Administered stimuli were 0.1-ms square wave pulses. Hip, knee, and ankle joints were fixed during the stimulation session to ensure that contractions were isometric. For OV and electrical stimulation experiments, mice were injected subcutaneously with either CsA (25 mg/kg), FK506 (3–5 mg/kg), or vehicle (Cremaphor® EL; Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) twice daily, separated by a 12-h interval, for 1–28 days. Injections were initiated 1 day prior to the beginning of each experiment. Vials of CsA (50 mg/ml; Novartis, Dorval, Quebec, Canada) were mixed in a ratio of 1:7 (v/v) with vehicle, whereas FK506 was solubilized in ethanol (5 μl/mg drug) and then diluted to a final concentration of 0.75 mg/ml with vehicle. To investigate the long term effect of calcineurin inhibition on the phosphorylation status of NFATc1 and MEF2 in normal weightbearing hindlimb muscles, rats were injected with CsA (10 mg/kg, n = 3) or vehicle (n = 3) twice daily, or FK506 (2 mg/kg, n = 2) once daily, for a period of 28 days. At respective end points, blood was collected for analyses of CsA and FK506 levels (London Health Science Center, London, Ontario, Canada). After each experimental condition, muscles were excised and quick-frozen in melting isopentane pre-cooled with liquid nitrogen. The 25 mg/kg dose of CsA in mice produced blood levels of this drug that were comparable with those obtained using a 10 mg/kg dose in rats (2865 ± 517 ng/ml in mice versus2137 ± 613 ng/ml in rats) and resulted in a ∼60% decrease in total plantaris calcineurin activity (17.4 ± 0.6 pmol/min/mg protein in vehicle-treated versus 7.1 ± 0.9 pmol/min/mg protein in CsA-treated mice, n = 3) as measured by Isotechnika (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Administration of FK506 resulted in lower blood levels in rats (13.0 ± 1.7 ng/ml) than in mice (83 ± 14 ng/ml). This lower dosage of FK506 in rats was necessary to ensure the maintenance of the health and body weight of these animals for the duration of the treatment period. Whole cell and nuclear extracts were generated as described previously (18Dunn S.E. Chin E.R. Michel R.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For in vitro alkaline phosphatase (AP) reactions, muscle samples (150 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of HEPES buffer (4 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 50 mm HEPES, pH = 7.4), incubated on ice for 1 h, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g. Each lysate (50 μg) was incubated with 0, 100, or 200 units of AP covalently linked to agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) in AP reaction buffer (1 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH = 8.5) at 30 °C for 15 min. The beads were separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, the supernatant recovered, and then concentrated to the original volume of added protein using a 5000 nominal molecular weight limit 4-ml Ultrafree® filter unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The concentration of total protein in whole cell, nuclear extract, and AP-treated samples was estimated with the Bradford Microassay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were each diluted in two volumes of 2× Laemmli Buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled for 3–5 min, and run on a 6–8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using the MiniProtean III system (Bio-Rad). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue to verify equal loading of samples. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Quebec, Canada) and stained with Ponceau S Red to verify equal transfer efficiency. Immunoblotting was performed using standard procedures with working dilutions of the following primary antibodies: NFATc1 (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO), MEF2A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and MEF2D (gift from Dr. R. Prywes). The MEF2D antibody cross-reacts with MEF2C and was used to estimate the abundance of this protein in whole cell and nuclear extracts. Membranes were subsequently probed with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody conjugates (Sigma), and labeled proteins were visualized using the ECL plus system and Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The size of each protein was estimated using a Kaleidoscope broad range protein standard (Bio-Rad). MEF2C was used as a gel loading control for normal weightbearing, denervated, TTX-inactivated, and electrical stimulation samples, because the expression of this protein did not differ between muscle types or across these different treatment conditions. For OV experiments, Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used as loading controls, because MEF2C protein content was found to increase over the time course of this condition (data not shown). We used AP-treated samples to determine which bands were best suited to measure the phosphorylation status of NFATc1, MEF2A, and MEF2D proteins. Up to 6 NFATc1 bands were detected ranging in molecular mass from 85 to 141 kDa (Fig. 1 A, see AP panels) in untreated samples. Pre-treatment of protein extracts with AP increased the prevalence of the 85- and 89-kDa species of NFATc1 (Fig. 1 A, closed arrows), suggesting that detected bands correspond to dephosphorylated (85 and 89 kDa) and phosphorylated (>89 kDa) forms of this protein. Similarly, AP treatment reduced both MEF2D and MEF2A bands to single 70-and 67-kDa species, respectively (Fig. 1 A, middle panels,closed arrows). The density of dephosphorylated (dePO4) and most phosphorylated (most PO4) band(s) of NFATc1, MEF2D, or MEF2A was determined using AlphaEase™/FluroChem™ software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) and expressed relative to the summed density of all bands for that sample. The desMEF2 Tg mice were identified by polymerase chain reaction screening of genomic DNA for the presence of the lacZ transgene using the following primers: sense (5′-TGCCGTCTGAATTTGACCTG-3′) and antisense (5′-GCATAACCACCACGCTCATC-3′). The lacZ transgene is not completely penetrant in this line of mice (11Wu H. Naya F.J. McKinsey T.A. Mercer B. Shelton J.M. Chin E.R. Simard A.R. Michel R.N. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Williams R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, to ensure that experimental desMEF2 Tg mice had the potential for lacZexpression, they were also screened for induction of β-gal activity in the right medial gastrocnemius in response to a paradigm of nerve electrical stimulation that consistently induces the expression of the transgene in this muscle: 3 half-hour sessions of intermittent 100-Hz stimulation (1 train every 30 s), with each session separated by a 4-h interval. The medial gastrocnemius muscle of the electrically stimulated limb was collected the following day and was quick-frozen in melting isopentane, pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. For OV animals, this muscle was collected during the synergist ablation surgery. To assay β-gal activity, cryosections (14–20 μm) were cut from each muscle midbelly and were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH = 7.4 for 10 min at 4 °C. Tissue sections were then rinsed three times for 5 min each time in 0.1m PBS at 4 °C and incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 3–12 h in a solution containing 0.1 m MgCl2, 0.5 m potassium ferricyanide, 0.5 mferrocyanide, and 40 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) in 0.2 m PBS. After a final two 5-min rinses in PBS, tissues were mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS. Ninety percent of mice displayed positive staining for β-gal in the right, stimulated medial gastrocnemius, and muscles in the left, nonstimulated limb of these mice were used for subsequent experiments. To determine the MHC content of each fiber, cryosections (10 μm) were cut from the same anatomical location in each muscle midbelly and recovered onto Superfrost® Plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) and were processed for immunohistochemistry as described previously (15Dunn S.E. Burns J.L. Michel R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21908-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were first blocked in 5% goat serum in 25 mm PBS (pH = 7.4) and then probed with one of the following primary antibodies raised against the different MHC types: type I (BA-F8), IIa (SC-71), IIb (BF-F3), all MHCs but IIx (BF-35), and embryonic (F1.652) (15Dunn S.E. Burns J.L. Michel R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21908-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). After three 10-min PBS rinses, sections were then probed with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or IgM, in the case of BF-F3 (Sigma). Bound antibody complexes were visualized using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Plasmids that encoded GFP linked to either full-length NFATc1 (NFATc1-GFP) or a truncated variant of this protein (amino acids 319–716, ΔNFATc1-GFP) were obtained from Dr. E. R. Chin (7Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Plasmids were extracted with chloroform and phenol and ethanol-precipitated overnight (−20 °C). The following day, DNA was resuspended in a sterile solution of 10% sucrose in 1× PBS (25 mm, pH = 7.4) at a concentration of 2 μg/μl. Mice were anesthetized, and the medial gastrocnemius was incised to expose the distal portion of the plantaris. Ten μl of this DNA solution was then injected into the muscle using a 30-gauge insulin syringe. To maximize the cellular uptake of the plasmid, muscles were pre-injected with 10 μl of 10% sucrose in PBS, 15 min prior to the injection of DNA. Muscles were excised from mice at 5 days after injection and then frozen in melting isopentane. Cryosections (−20 °C) of the distal plantaris were cut, fixed in methanol (−20 °C) for 5 min, and then incubated with bisbenzimide (0.05 μg/ml) in PBS for 30 min in the dark to stain nuclei. Sections were subsequently rinsed (three times for 10 min each in PBS) and exposed to UV or fluorescein isothiocyanate illumination to visualize nuclei (at 465 nm) and NFAT-GFP fusion proteins (at 500 nm), respectively. To test the hypothesis that calcineurin signaling is modulated by nerve-mediated activity, we first investigated whether the calcineurin substrates NFATc1, MEF2A, or MEF2D are dephosphorylated to a greater extent in the soleus, a more highly recruited (20Pierotti D.J. Roy R.R. Gregor R.J. Edgerton V.R. Brain Res. 1989; 481: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and relatively slower (i.e. equal proportions of fibers expressing I or IIa MHC) muscle, versus its synergist, the medial gastrocnemius, a comparatively less active (20Pierotti D.J. Roy R.R. Gregor R.J. Edgerton V.R. Brain Res. 1989; 481: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), faster (i.e. proportionately large number of fibers expressing IIx or IIb MHC) plantar flexor under normal weightbearing conditions. Western blots of whole cell extracts showed a multiple banding pattern for each of these transcription factors. We identified dephosphorylated (dePO4,closed arrows) and most phosphorylated (most PO4, open arrows) forms of these proteins (Fig.1 A). All of these calcineurin substrates were more extensively dephosphorylated (Fig. 1, Aand B) and expressed at higher levels relative to total protein (Fig. 1 A) in the soleus compared with the medial gastrocnemius under normal weightbearing conditions. Compared with the soleus, the medial gastrocnemius displayed at least 2-fold higher levels of the most PO4 form of all three substrates and approximately half the levels of the dePO4 form of NFATc1 and MEF2D (Fig. 1 B). For MEF2A, the divergence in banding patterns between these muscles was limited to the higher molecular weight species of this protein. The soleus also displayed higher amounts of NFATc1 in nuclear extracts compared with its less active synergist (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, NFATc1 detected in the nuclei from both muscles displayed multiple bands, consistent with the notion that partial dephosphorylation of this protein is sufficient to induce its nuclear import (18Dunn S.E. Chin E.R. Michel R.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the enhanced dephosphorylation and expression of MEF2A and MEF2D observed in more active muscles (i.e. the soleus) was associated with an increase in transactivational function of MEF2, we used Tg mice (desMEF2) that express a lacZreporter gene driven by three high affinity MEF2 cis-elements from the desmin promoter (11Wu H.

In contrast to a previous report of positive MEF2 transcriptional activity in ∼15% of the solei from mice of this line (11Wu H. Naya F.J. McKinsey T.A. Mercer B. Shelton J.M. Chin E.R. Simard A.R.

A variety of evidence points to the importance of Aβ-membrane interactions in the mechanism of Aβ neurotoxicity and indicates that cholesterol and gangliosides are particularly important for Aβ aggregation and binding to membranes. We investigated the effects of cholesterol and sialic acid depletion on Aβ-induced GTPase activity in cells, a step implicated in the mechanism of Aβ toxicity, and Aβ-induced cell toxicity. Cholesterol reduction and depletion of membrane-associated sialic acid residues both significantly reduced the Aβ-induced GTPase activity. In addition, cholesterol and membrane-associated sialic acid residue depletion or inhibition of cholesterol and ganglioside synthesis protected PC12 cells from Aβ-induced toxicity. These results indicate the importance of Aβ-membrane interactions in the mechanism of Aβ toxicity. In addition, these results suggest that control of cellular cholesterol and/or ganglioside content may prove useful in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease."

Relatively slow cis-trans-isomerization in the absence of hydroxyproline likely represents the rate-limiting factor in the propagation of the unhydroxylated collagen helix.

However, unlike with bovine collagen I, the recombinant collagen did not self-assemble into banded fibrils in physiological ionic strength buffer at 20 °C. Striated fibrils were only obtained with low ionic strength buffer. We propose that, under physiological ionic strength conditions, the hydroxyl groups in the native molecule retain water more efficiently thus favoring correct fibril formation.

Two different forms of the triple-helical molecule may occur, depending on the presence of one or both of the genetically distinct chains α1(I) and α2(I). The most studied and widely distributed form is the heterotrimer [α1(I)]2α2(I), although significant amounts of the homotrimer [α1(I)]3 are present in embryonic and fetal tissues (1Jimenez S.A. Bashey R.I. Benditt M. Yankowski R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The sequence of the large triple-helical domain consists of a repeated tripeptide sequence Gly-X-Y, where X and Y are frequently proline and hydroxyproline, respectively (2van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The strict recurrence of this sequence ensures the correct folding of three α chains into a stable triple helix extending over a thousand residues, whereas the high content of hydroxyproline increases the thermal stability of the molecule. Fibril formation is considered as a self-assembly process that depends on the intrinsic properties of the molecules themselves such as the distribution of polar and hydrophobic residues, the persistence of the short non-helical segments at the extremities of the mature molecule (3Prockop D.J. Fertala A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Sato K. Ebihara T. Adachi E. Kawashima S. Hattori S. Irie S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25870-25875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the possible copolymerization into a single fibril of several different fibrillar collagen types. Different α chain stoichiometries are also an important factor. For instance, the collagen I homotrimer can form fibrils in vitro although less efficiently than the heterotrimer (5McBride Jr., D.J. Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. Matrix. 1992; 12: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The most obvious difference between the two molecules is the absence of the α2(I) chain in the homotrimer that is present in the heterotrimer. This prompted the speculation that chain composition can dictate fibril formation kinetics by differences in entropy. Whereas cells might provide additional control of the formation and deposition of fibrils in vivo, in vitro reconstitution of fibrils is triggered simply by warming, neutralizing the pH, and increasing the ionic strength to physiological values. Although fibril formation appears to be a very simple process, the molecular mechanisms that drive self-assembly of monomers are far from elucidated. The general thermodynamic mechanism commonly accepted is that fibril formation is an entropy-driven process accompanied by a loss of water from the surface of the molecules (6Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance in fibril formation of structured water molecules at the surface of collagen monomers was recently brought out by studying the crystal structures of collagen model peptides (7Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 8Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M.

(Tokyo). 1999; 125: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), revealed that whereas the overall molecular conformations are similar, different crystal packing arrangements are observed. Analysis of hydration patterns in the presence or absence of hydroxyproline residues provides an unexpected and novel clue to the understanding of the collagen self-assembly mechanism. From these structural data, it was thus speculated that hydroxyproline residues may have a critical role in the organization of the water network surrounding the triple helix resulting in a lateral molecular packing similar to that which occurs in fibrils (9Kramer R.Z. Vitagliano L. Bella J. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Brodsky B. Zagari A. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Indeed, as early as in the 1950s, the role of hydroxyproline residues in the stabilization of the collagen fibril structure through hydrogen bonds has been highlighted (14Gustavson K.H. Nature. 1955; 175: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The study of the role of hydroxyproline in fibril formation by routine in vitro fibril formation experiments suffers from difficulties in producing large amounts of stable unhydroxylated collagen I molecules. Recently, we have shown (15Ruggiero F. Exposito J.Y. Bournat P. Gruber V. Perret S. Comte J. Olagnier B. Garrone R. Theisen M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) that tobacco plants provide a useful expression system for the large scale production of recombinant collagen. Interestingly, although hydroxylation of proline residues did not occur in plants, the recombinant collagen adopted a stable triple-helical conformation, and thus this provides an impetus for studying the role of hydroxyproline in fibril formation. For this purpose, we have used this system to prepare adequate amounts of unhydroxylated recombinant collagen I homotrimer to study both its molecular characteristics and its ability to form fibrils. The results indicate that although the molecule shows features similar to the native collagen I homotrimer and heterotrimer, the experimental conditions required for fibril formation differ markedly from those previously established for native collagen I. The importance of hydroxyproline in self-assembly as proposed from the crystal structures of collagen model peptides is thus here experimentally confirmed on the whole collagen molecule. Collagens were extracted from fetal calf bones by pepsin digestion and separated by repeated salt fractionation as described previously (16Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.F. Garrone R. Aumailley M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 0.7 m NaCl and 0.9 m NaCl precipitates containing the [α1(I)]2α2(I) collagen I heterotrimer (Het I)1 and the [α1(I)]3 collagen I homotrimer (Hom I), respectively, were analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE. Collagen I different isoforms were then dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid, dialyzed against 0.1 m acetic acid to eliminate salt, and then lyophilized. Recombinant collagen was extracted and purified from field-grown tobacco plants transformed with human pro-α1(I) chain cDNA lacking the N-propeptide coding sequence (15Ruggiero F. Exposito J.Y. Bournat P. Gruber V. Perret S. Comte J. Olagnier B. Garrone R. Theisen M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Fresh tobacco leaves and stems were frozen and homogenized in liquid nitrogen. After extraction in 0.5 m acetic acid containing 0.2 m NaCl, the recombinant collagen was purified by repeated salt fractionation. The 0.9 m precipitate containing the recombinant collagen (rColl I) was solubilized in 0.1 m acetic acid and purified by CM-Sepharose chromatography in 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8. The purified recombinant collagen was then dialyzed against 0.1m acetic acid and lyophilized. Samples were analyzed by either 6, 5–15, or 3.5–5% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as indicated. Gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue or electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, 5% methanol, overnight. After saturation, membranes were probed with polyclonal antibodies against human collagen I (Novotec, France) followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Immunoblots were revealed with the alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Collagen solutions were prepared at 500 μg/ml in 0.1 m acetic acid. Solutions were diluted in an equivalent volume of 2× PBS, and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 m NaOH. The N-hydroxysuccinimide ester cross-linker disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, Pierce) was dissolved in Me2SO and subsequently added to the collagen solutions at a ratio 1:50. Cross-linking reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at 4 °C and then were quenched by the addition of a large excess of Tris. The efficiency of the collagen molecule cross-linking was analyzed by 3.5–5% gradient SDS-PAGE. Cross-linked collagen molecules were then dialyzed against 0.1 m acetic acid at 4 °C before circular dichroism experiments. Solutions of collagen or cross-linked collagen were dissolved in 0.1 m acetic acid and denatured at 60 °C for 15 min immediately before CD analysis. Renaturation CD spectra were recorded at 222 nm at 10 °C on a CD6 Jobin Yvon spectropolarimeter equipped with a 1-mm path length thermostatically controlled quartz cuvette. For comparison, spectra were normalized, and the fraction of folded molecules was calculated as follow:F = (θobs − θmin)/(θmax − θmin), where θobs represents the observed molar ellipticity; θmax was measured before denaturation at 10 °C, and θmin corresponds to the value measured after denaturation at 60 °C. To compare the data from the different samples, the time (t12) at which F = 0.5 was determined. To determine the thermal stability of recombinant collagen fibrils, samples were prepared at a concentration of 700 μg/ml in 10 mm potassium phosphate. Collagen solutions in 0.1m acetic acid were also analyzed as controls. Thermal transition curves were measured by monitoring [θ]226 nm in 10 mm phosphate for the fibrils and [θ]222 nm in 0.1 m acetic acid for the collagen solutions as a function of temperature. The temperature was increased in increments of 1 °C followed by equilibration for 5 min before collecting each data point. The Tm values at which F = 0.5 were determined as stated above. To find out the pH and ionic strength conditions that favor the polymerization of the recombinant collagen into striated fibrils, in vitrofibril formation was carried out by dialysis of the collagen molecular solution at a concentration of 200 μg/ml against different buffers at 4 °C, overnight. The following buffers were tested: phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 0.15 mmK2HPO4, 2.6 mm KCl, 0.137m NaCl), 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4; 20 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 and 9.0; 20 mmKH2PO4, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.4; 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7. SLS crystallites were obtained by dialyzing collagen monomers against 0.4% ATP in 0.1 m acetic acid for 72 h at 4 °C. After fibril and SLS crystallite formation, drops of the different samples were placed onto Formvar-carbon grids and then negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid at pH 7.4 and/or positively stained with 0.2% phosphotungstic acid and 1% uranyl acetate as indicated. Stained aggregates were examined using a Philips CM 120 transmission electron microscope at the “Centre de Microscopie Appliqué à la Biologie et à la Géologie” (Université Claude Bernard, Villeurbanne, France). Fibril diameters were measured directly from calibrated electron micrographs, and the values were plotted as histograms. Chilled quartz cuvettes were filled with cold solutions of collagen I samples (rColl I, Hom I, and Het I) at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml in 10 mmmonopotassium phosphate, pH 7. Cuvettes were placed into a spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, DU 640), connected to a water bath at 10 °C, and absorbance at 313 nm was recorded. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Dynamic light scattering experiments were carried out with a Malvern 4700 spectrometer (Malvern Instruments, UK) using a Siemens He-Ne laser (wavelength 633 nm, power 40 milliwatts) and a 256-channel correlator. Solutions of collagen I were analyzed in 0.5 m acetic acid at a concentration of 0.4–0.5 mg/ml and were centrifuged 30 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C immediately prior to each experiment. All measurements were made at 90° at different temperatures ranging from 11 to 35 °C. Population distributions were fit to the experimental correlation curves using the Contin program provided by the manufacturers, and diffusion coefficients (D20,w) were calculated. Collagen concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Samples were hydrolyzed under vacuum (6n HCl, 115 °C, 24 h) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol in a Pico Tag system (Waters) and then analyzed with a Beckman amino acid analyzer. Collagen I heterotrimer and homotrimer were extracted from embryonic calf bones by pepsin digestion and then isolated by repeated differential salt precipitation. Both heterotrimeric and homotrimeric forms of collagen I are present in calf bones, as shown previously (15Ruggiero F. Exposito J.Y. Bournat P. Gruber V. Perret S. Comte J. Olagnier B. Garrone R. Theisen M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and both isoforms were used for this study. The predominant form of collagen I, the heterotrimer [α1(I)]2α2(I), referred to as Het I, precipitated selectively at 0.7 m NaCl, whereas the homotrimer [α1(I)]3, referred to as Hom I, was recovered in the 0.9 m NaCl precipitate (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and 3). To exclude the possibility that the different isoforms purified by salt fractionation contained collagen III, we examined the electrophoretic behavior of these molecules under reducing or non-reducing conditions. No bands migrating in the position of trimers were observed in absence of reducing agent, indicating that no collagen III was present in the samples (Fig. 1 B). The absence of contaminating heterotrimers in the collagen I homotrimer sample was attested by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies against bovine collagen I. No band migrating at the α2(I) position was detected in the homotrimer sample, whereas this band was clearly present in the 0.7m precipitate (Fig. 1 C). Recombinant homotrimeric collagen I (rColl I) from transgenic tobacco plants that carry the construct lacking the N-propeptide domain was extracted by acetic acid and purified by differential salt precipitation as described (15Ruggiero F. Exposito J.Y. Bournat P. Gruber V. Perret S. Comte J. Olagnier B. Garrone R. Theisen M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that the C-propeptides were cleaved during the extraction procedure and thus the purified molecules correspond to mature collagen. However, as observed previously, rColl I migrated faster than the α1(I) bovine collagen chain (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). This migration was shown to be due to the lack of hydroxylation in the plant system. The purity of the different collagen samples was judged by Coomassie Blue staining of the 5–15% gradient SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and by amino acid composition analysis (not shown). Recombinant collagen is folded into a triple helix similar to that of native collagen I (15Ruggiero F. Exposito J.Y. Bournat P. Gruber V. Perret S. Comte J. Olagnier B. Garrone R. Theisen M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), as judged by circular dichroism, proteinase resistance, and electron microscopy after rotary shadowing. Because of the lack of prolyl hydroxylation however, the melting temperature (Tm) of the unhydroxylated molecule is relatively low (30 °C). To investigate the consequences of such properties unique to unhydroxylated trimers, native and recombinant collagens were compared in terms of stability, flexibility, and ability to form fibrils. It has been shown using short host-guest peptides that the presence of hydroxyproline accelerates refolding of the collagen triple helix (17Ackerman M.S. Bhate M. Shenoy N. Beck K. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7668-7673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The availability of significant amounts of both hydroxylated and non-hydroxylated trimers allowed this conclusion to be tested on full-length collagen molecules. Because studies on collagen renaturation are hampered by problems of chain misalignment, we chose to introduce intramolecular cross-links, as present naturally in e.g. collagen III, before denaturation-renaturation. In parallel, homotrimeric bovine collagen I was cross-linked as a control. An N-hydroxysuccinimide ester cross-linker presenting a short spacer arm of 7.7 Å (DSG) was used to favor intra-molecular cross-links and avoid the formation of higher molecular weight aggregates. As expected, cross-linked trimers were predominantly observed on a 3.5–5% electrophoretic gel, whereas no monomer chains were present, and only a faint band migrating at the top of the gel, corresponding to supra-molecular aggregates, was detected (Fig.2 A). At 10 °C, spectra obtained by circular dichroism for the recombinant cross-linked collagen were typical of a triple-helical conformation. Cross-linking had no effect on the Tm of the recombinant collagen (30 °C; Fig. 2 B), indicating no change in overall thermal stability. Following denaturation, however, hydroxylated native homotrimers (Hom I) renatured more quickly than unhydroxylated recombinant homotrimers (rColl I; Fig. 2 C). Although triple helix formation is not prevented by the lack of prolyl hydroxylation, correct prolyl hydroxylation favors helix assembly. The flexibility of rColl I molecules, another parameter that might affect fibril formation, was assessed by dynamic light scattering at different temperatures (Fig. 3). At 11 °C, the diffusion coefficient of the native heterotrimer (Het I) was as expected (6.6 ± 1.6 × 10−8cm2 s−1) (18Payne K.J. King T.A. Holmes D.F. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 1185-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficient of the native homotrimer (Hom I) was somewhat greater, whereas that of the recombinant homotrimer (rColl I) was greater still. This indicates that the recombinant molecule adopts a more compact and therefore more flexible conformation than the native collagens. At 20 °C, the temperature used for fibril formation (see below), the diffusion coefficients of all three collagens increased, consistent with a general increase in compactness/flexibility. This trend continued at 25 and 35 °C, although because of the relatively low Tm, measurements at 35 °C were not carried out for recombinant collagen. It is noteworthy that the diffusion coefficients for the recombinant homotrimer at 20 and 25 °C were similar to that for the native heterotrimer at 35 °C. The capacity of the recombinant collagen to form supra-molecular structures was studied using SLS crystallites, an artificial mode of molecular packing in which polyanions such as ATP cross-bridge positively charged collagen molecules to induce lateral register aggregation. SLS crystallites were obtained with recombinant collagen that displayed a characteristic asymmetric cross-banding pattern after positive staining (Fig. 4). Their average length (261 ± 11 nm) corresponded to that of single molecules and was consistent with the lengths of SLS crystallites formed from bovine heterotrimer and homotrimer (271 ± 10 and 276 ± 7 nm, respectively). Moreover, alignment of all three forms of SLS crystallites revealed an overall similarity in the banding pattern indicating an identical distribution of polar residues (Fig.4 D). Neutralizing the pH and increasing the temperature of purified collagen molecules in solution generally provokes the formation of a gel containing striated fibrils. Thus increasing the temperature to 34–35 °C clearly favors fibril formation of native collagen molecules. Because of the low Tm (30 °C) of the unhydroxylated recombinant collagen, fibril formation experiments could not be carried out at this temperature. Therefore, the capacity of the unhydroxylated recombinant collagen to form fibrils was explored by performing experiments at 20 °C. Purified rColl I molecules were incubated in PBS, a physiological buffer that normally allows fibril formation. As controls, fibril formation of bovine homotrimer and heterotrimer was carried out under the same conditions. As expected, a meshwork of fibrils exhibiting the typical D-periodic banding pattern was observed when Het I and Hom I solutions were incubated in PBS at 20 °C (Fig.5, B and C). In contrast, negative staining of rColl I aggregates formed in PBS showed thin filamentous structures devoid of D-periodic striation (Fig.5 A). To check whether potential traces of plant contaminants might have prevented striated fibril formation, bovine homotrimeric molecules were mixed with tobacco crude extract and then subjected to salt fractionation. Negative staining of the fibrils formed with this preparation showed the presence of fibrils essentially identical to those observed with reconstituted standard homotrimeric collagen I (data not shown). Critical conditions allowing formation of striated fibrils from unhydroxylated recombinant collagen were identified by varying the ionic strength of the fibrillogenesis buffer. Under all other conditions (variations of pH and temperature), no striated fibrils were formed. Only when recombinant collagen was incubated in low ionic strength buffer (10 mm phosphate, pH 7) was striated fibril assembly observed. Under these conditions, cross-banded fibrils were predominant, and the measured periodicity was 65.9 ± 0.8 nm which is close to the 67 nm expected value (Fig.6, A–C). Under the same conditions, Het I formed a meshwork of long and thin striated fibrils (Fig. 6, D and E), whereas Hom I only aggregated into non-banded fibrils (Fig. 6 F). The rColl I fibrils were particularly heterogenous in size and morphology (Fig. 6,A–C). Fibril diameter measurements confirmed that recombinant unhydroxylated fibrils presented a broad distribution with a minimum at 15 nm and a maximum at about 500 nm. In contrast, Het I showed the highest frequency of striated fibrils with a diameter of about 40 nm (Fig. 6 G). Fibril formation in 10 mm phosphate was followed by monitoring turbidity at 313 nm as a function of time. The amplitude of the plateau value is a function of both the amount of reconstituted fibrils and their final width. Fibrillogenesis kinetics under these conditions (10 °C, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7) were instantaneous whichever collagen was used. No significant difference was observed between the kinetics for Het I and rColl I (Fig.7). The morphology of the fibrils obtained after completion of turbidity measurements was identical to that previously shown (Fig. 6). Thus, the formation of striated fibrils with unhydroxylated collagen, contrary to hydroxylated homotrimeric collagen I, is dependent on the low ionic strength of the buffer. As shown for native collagens, fibril formation increased substantially the melting temperature of the recombinant collagen which reached 36 °C instead of 30 °C for the isolated molecules (data not shown). The study of collagen molecules that are correctly folded but lack hydroxyproline residues, as produced in transgenic plants, provides clues to understand how these residues contribute to triple-helical folding and, more strikingly, useful insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive fibrillogenesis. Hydroxyproline plays an unquestionable role in the thermal stability of collagen molecules, where the number of hydroxyproline residues in the triple-helical domains is directly related to the melting temperature. In collagen-like peptides that form triple helices, the substitution of hydroxyproline for proline in the Y-position of the repeating Gly -X-Y triplets increases the thermal stability by as much 15 °C (19Sakakibara S. Inouye K. Shudo K. Kishida Y. Kobayashi Y. Prockop D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 303: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As a result, the melting temperatures of recombinant unhydroxylated collagen I produced in plants and of fully hydroxylated parental collagen I homotrimer show distinct disparities (30 °C for the recombinant collagen versus 41 °C for the native bovine homotrimer). The role of hydroxyproline in collagen folding is less clear. When hydroxylation is blocked by addition of α,α′-dipyridyl, fibroblasts synthesize the unhydroxylated form of procollagen I, known as protocollagen (21Fiedler-Nagy C. Bruckner P. Hayashi T. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 212: 668-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the data show that the folding of protocollagen is more efficient than that of fully hydroxylated collagen. Apparently, because it lacks hydroxyproline, the stability of mismatched triple-helical regions is decreased, and thus the protein is less likely to be locked into unfavorable conformations that impede the propagation step. However, the folding of protocollagen I was found to be less efficient than the folding of collagen III. The latter formed fully aligned triple helices in vitro most likely because of the presence of interchain disulfide bonds within the C-terminal end of the triple-helical domain (22Bachinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To avoid possible α chain misalignments that could disturb the folding rate, we chemically cross-linked the collagen molecules before refolding the thermally denatured protein. Identical fractions of folded triple helices were reached with fully hydroxylated collagen I homotrimer and recombinant collagen indicating that, when cross-linked, the helix-to-coil transition of both collagens was reversible. However, we observed a marked difference in the folding rate that was 5-fold faster for native homotrimeric collagen than for unhydroxylated recombinant collagen. The increased folding rate of collagen III in the presence of cis-trans-isomerase indicated that cis-trans-isomerization of proline/hydroxyproline is a rate-limiting factor in collagen molecular assembly (23Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17144-17148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In related work, substitution of (4 R)-fluoroproline for (4 R)-hydroxyproline in collagen-like peptides was shown to increase the Tm of the triple helix (24Holmgren S.K. Taylor K.M. Bretscher L.E. Raines R.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 666-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Because (4 R)-fluoroproline did not provide a site for hydrogen bonding of water, these authors proposed that an electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the hydroxyl or fluoro groups favors the trans-configuration of the peptide bond required for formation of the triple helix. As a consequence, the inductive effect of the hydroxyl group of hydroxyproline enhances the stability of the triple helix by favoring the requisite trans-conformation of the Hyp bond. In our results, the relatively slow cis-trans-isomerization in the absence of hydroxyproline thus likely became the rate-limiting factor for the propagation of the recombinant unhydroxylated collagen helix. In agreement with this concept, the use of collagen-like peptides for refolding studies showed that all triplets of the form Gly-Xaa-Hyp promoted rapid folding, whereas Gly-Xaa-Pro triplets were less favorable (17Ackerman M.S. Bhate M. Shenoy N. Beck K. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7668-7673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Collagen self-assembly is an entropy-driven process that depends on ionic strength, pH, and temperature. Unlike hydroxylated heterotrimers or homotrimers, we found that unhydroxylated homotrimers did not assemble into striated fibrils under physiological buffer conditions. Instead, fibril formation of unhydroxylated collagen required both low ionic strength and temperature, the latter being imposed by the relatively low thermal stability of the molecule. To investigate further how the lack of hydroxylation might affect physical properties, we showed by dynamic light scattering that unhydroxylated collagen molecules appeared to be more compact/flexible than native collagen at temperatures between 11 and 25 °C. At 25 °C, the compactness/flexibility of the recombinant collagen was found to be comparable with that of the native heterotrimer at 35 °C, i.e. in both cases ∼5 °C below their respective melting temperatures. Increased flexibility might actually favor fibril formation because molecules are likely to adopt a bent conformation within fibrils (25George A. Veis A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Kadler K.E. Holmes D.F. Trotter J.A. Chapman J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 27Wess T.J. Hammersley A.P. Wess L. Miller A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus the flexibility of the recombinant molecule at 20–25 °C might be conducive to fibril formation. However, our data showed that at 20 °C unhydroxylated molecules did not form striated fibrils at physiological pH and ionic strength. In contrast, hydroxylated homotrimers and heterotrimers did assemble under these conditions, despite their reduced flexibility. Thus differences in molecular flexibility do not appear to be a major influence on the ability to form striated fibrils. Low ionic strength conditions appear therefore to be the major requirement for fibril formation of unhydroxylated collagen homotrimers. Under the same conditions, hydroxylated bovine homotrimers form amorphous fibrils, whereas striated fibrils are formed at physiological ionic strength. We propose that the absence of hydroxylation would lead to an overall increase in hydrophobicity throughout the protein, thus masking specific hydrophobic interactions required for ordered self-assembly. The salting out effect at physiological salt concentrations would therefore be enhanced leading to amorphous precipitation of unhydroxylated collagen. Lowering the ionic strength would reduce the hydrophobic effect and lead to ordered self-assembly through both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. In contrast, amorphous precipitation of bovine homotrimers at low ionic strength might be due to the relative weakness of specific hydrophobic interactions under these conditions. Such an interpretation is favored by our observation that heterotrimers formed striated fibrils at low ionic strength, and by a previous report (5McBride Jr., D.J. Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. Matrix. 1992; 12: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that the greater hydrophobicity of the α2(I) chain compared with the α1(I) chain leads to improved fibril formation of heterotrimers. In addition to possible differences in hydrophobicity, the presence of hydroxyproline has been shown to enhance the hydration shell around collagen-like peptides in such a way as to influence directly the lateral packing of molecules in crystals (7Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 8Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 893-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 9Kramer R.Z. Vitagliano L. Bella J. Berisio R. Mazzarella L. Brodsky B. Zagari A. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Direct Hyp-Hyp interactions between molecules have also been observed, particularly in the structure of the triple-helical peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-Glu-Lys-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)5 (11Kramer R.Z. Venugopal M.G. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1191-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus the lateral packing in fibrils of unhydroxylated collagen may differ from that in native collagen fibrils. The integrity of the triple helix is a necessary prerequisite for correct fibril formation, and the telopeptides are known to play a catalytic role (28Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36083-36088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In our experiments recombinant collagen was obtained in mature form, i.e. after removal of propeptides but without the use of pepsin, thereby leaving the telopeptides mostly intact at the N terminus and with 3–5 residues remaining at the C terminus (data not shown). In contrast, both the bovine heterotrimer and homotrimer were isolated following pepsin extraction. All molecules were indistinguishable by analysis of SLS crystallites formed in vitro. The observation that both bovine heterotrimers and homotrimers formed striated fibrils under physiological buffer conditions, whereas recombinant homotrimers with more intact telopeptides did not, further reinforces our conclusion that the differences in fibril formation were due to the lack of hydroxylation. Fibril formation increases the thermal stability of native bovine collagen by as much as 10 °C (29Olsen D.R. Leigh S.D. Chang R. McMullin H. Ong W. Tai E. Chisholm G. Birk D.E. Berg R.A. Hitzeman R.A. Toman P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24038-24043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We showed that the melting temperature of recombinant collagen fibrils was also increased by about 6 °C, showing that thermal stability is raised once the unhydroxylated molecules are stabilized by the fibril structure. This result might be of interest for its use as biomaterials. We conclude that hydroxyproline might contribute more than previously thought to correct fibril formation under experimental conditions mimicking those that can occur physiologically. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive collagen self-assembly must therefore take account of the role of hydroxyproline.

We used the substituted cysteine accessibility method to identify amino acid residues in the channel forming domain, M2 that face the water-accessible surface and to locate their position in the ion conduction pathway. Cysteine was substituted for each residue, one at a time, in the M2 segment (Asp274–Asp298). 5-Hydroxytryptamine EC50 values for functional mutants did not vary from wild type (1.4 ± 0.2 μm) by more than 10-fold, and five mutants were nonfunctional. Covalent modification of the mutant receptors with sulfydryl reagents revealed 11 residues to be water-accessible, with a pattern consistent with an α-helix except at Leu285 and Leu293. The data suggest that charge selectivity begins at a more cytoplasmic level than Val291. Modification at some positions (Val291, Leu293, Ile294, Leu287, and Ser280) resulted in channels that were locked open. Reaction rates with accessible cysteines were voltage-dependent at some residues, suggesting that access occurs via the ion channel.

These receptors are pentamers, usually formed by the co-assembly of one to four different subunits each with a large extracellular N-terminal region and four putative transmembrane domains (M1–M4). Two 5-HT3 receptor subunits, 5-HT3A (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) and 5-HT3B (2Davies P.A.

Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), have been identified so far, and receptors can function as either homo-oligomeric (A only) or hetero-oligomeric receptors (2Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that the Cys loop family of receptors is modular in design, with the extracellular N-terminal domain containing the ligand binding site and the transmembrane regions containing the pore (3Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). There is good evidence from a variety of studies that the second transmembrane segment, M2, lines the channel (4Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Studies on acetylcholine receptors, for example, have identified rings of residues that alter conductance (5Imoto K. Busch C.

Nature. 1995; 376: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The high resolution structure of a protein homologous to the extracellular domain of the acetylcholine receptor was recently determined (9Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar); however, so far details of the complete structure of any of this family of receptors are lacking. The substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) has been used to identify systematically the residues that line an ion channel. Here residues in a membrane-spanning segment are individually mutated to cysteine and each mutant receptor expressed in Xenopusoocytes. If the mutant receptors have similar properties to wild type, it can be assumed that their structure is similar to that of wild type. The accessibility of each residue can then be determined by examining the ability of small sulfydryl-specific reagents to react with the cysteine. The information gained is able to provide information on the secondary structure of channel-lining segments and the location of ion channel gates and selectivity filters and to map binding sites within the channel (10Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). SCAM has been used to identify pore-lining residues in a variety of ion channels, including the nACh and GABAAreceptors. The M2 regions in these receptors gave a similar but not identical pattern of labeling and supported previous studies suggesting that this region is largely α-helical. There are, however, some discrepancies, particularly in the region surrounding the conserved central leucine residue. The amino acid sequence of the 5-HT3A receptor subunit displays strong sequence similarity with nACh receptor subunits, especially in the M2 region (e.g. the α1 nACh receptor subunit as illustrated in Fig. 1). We therefore wanted to confirm that the water-accessible residues in this receptor are similar to those in the nACh and GABAA receptors and also explore whether the use of homomeric receptors could provide additional information about the structure and function of M2. The data revealed a similar but not identical pattern of water-accessible residues in the pore to those previously observed for other members of the Cys loop ligand-gated ion channel family and also provided new information about the structure and role of certain residues located in and around the pore. The sulfydryl reagents [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) and sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) were obtained from Biotium, Inc. (Haywood, CA). To minimize hydrolysis of these reagents, stock solutions in water were made daily, stored on ice, and diluted in buffer to the appropriate concentration just before use. All other reagents were of the highest quality. Mutant 5-HT3A receptor subunits were developed using the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (InVitrogen, Abingdon, UK) containing the complete coding sequence for the 5-HT3A(b)subunit from NIE-115 cells as described previously (11Hargreaves A.C. Taylor C.W. Lummis S.C.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1120-1128PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis reactions were performed using the Kunkel method (12Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild type (WT) and mutant receptor subunit coding sequences were then subcloned into pGEMHE plasmid (13Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). This was linearized with NheI (New England Biolabs) and cRNA synthesized as described previously (14Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Oocytes from Xenopus laevis, prepared and maintained as described previously (14Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), were injected with 50 nl of cRNA (10–200 ng/μl), and the experiments were performed 1–6 days following injection. 5-HT-induced currents were recorded from individual oocytes using two-voltage electrode clamp as described previously (14Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–25 °C). Agarose cushion electrodes (15Schriebmayer W. Lester H.A. Dascal N. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 426: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of less than 2 MΩ. The ground electrode was connected to the bath by a 3 mKCl/agar bridge. During experiments the oocytes were continuously perfused (6 ml/min) in calcium-free frog Ringer solution (CFFR) of the following composition: 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The holding potential was maintained at −60 mV unless otherwise specified. To determine EC50 and maximal 5-HT concentrations, 5-HT dose-response curves were fitted to the following Hill equation. I=(Imax[A]n)/(EC50n+[A]n)Eq. 1 where Imax is the maximal peak current, [A] is the concentration of agonist, and n is the Hill cooefficient. The positively charged -SCH2CH2N(CH3)3+moiety is added to cysteine following reaction with MTSET. Following reaction with MTSES the negatively charged -SCH2CH2SO3−group is added to cysteine. The reactions of wild type and mutant 5-HT3 receptors with 1 mm MTSET or 10 mm MTSES were tested using alternating pulses of maximal (5-HTMAX) and EC50 (5-HT50) concentrations of 5-HT before and after addition of the sulfydryl reagent. Changes in the peak current induced by the EC505-HT test pulses are more sensitive to effects of modification on gating kinetics, whereas changes in the peak current induced by the maximal 5-HT test pulses are more sensitive to the effects of modification on conductance (16Zhang H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7952-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus a typical protocol would be: 5-HTMAX 30 s, CFFR 5 min, 5-HT50 30 s, CFFR 5 min, 5-HTMAX30 s, CFFR 5 min, 5-HT50 30 s, CFFR 5 min, 5-HTMAX plus sulfydryl reagent 1 min, CFFR 10 min, 5-HTMAX 30 s, CFFR 5 min, 5-HT50 30 s, CFFR 5 min, 5-HTMAX 30 s, CFFR 5 min, 5-HT50 30 s, and CFFR 5 min. Average currents elicited by 5-HTMAX and 5-HT50 before and after application of sulfydryl reagent were compared with the irreversible effect of the reagent. The effect of the reagent was taken as shown in the following equation.[(I5­HT,after/I5­HT,before)−1]Eq. 2 Data for each mutant were compared with wild type by one-way analysis of variance applying the Dunnett post-hoc test (p < 0.05) using Prism v3.0 (Graphpad Software Inc, CA). We infer that the sulfydryl reagents have reacted with a cysteine if the subsequent 5-HT-induced currents are significantly different than the initial 5-HT-induced currents. The MTS reagents react 5 × 109 times faster with ionized thiolates than with thiols (17Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We assumed that only cysteines on the water-accessible surface of a protein ionize to any significant extent; thus we inferred that reactive cysteines were on the water-accessible surface of the protein. In addition, MTSET+ and MTSES− are membrane-impermeant (18Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and thus when we applied them extracellularly they only had access to residues that were on the extracellular water-accessible surface of the protein. Rate constants for reaction of MTSET and MTSES with substituted cysteines were determined as described previously (20Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, second order rate constants for MTSET were obtained using a voltage-step protocol as shown in Fig. 2 C. Current because of leak and the effect of desensitization were subtracted from the currents recorded during application of 5-HT plus MTSET. The decrease in current was approximately linear, and the second order rate constant (k) was estimated from the following equation. k=(I2−I1)/[x(I1(t2−t1)]Eq. 3 where I is current, t is time,x is the concentration of sulfydryl reagent, and the subscripts refer to the beginning and end of each voltage-step interval. Reaction with MTSES caused a large and irreversible decrease in inactivation rate; therefore we used a different protocol to determine the rate of reaction with this reagent. The following sequence of reagents was applied repeatedly (see Fig. 7 A): 5-HTMAX 20–30 s, CFFR 5 min, 5-HTMAX plus sulfydryl reagent 20–40 s, CFFR 5 min, 5-HTMAX 20–30 s, and CFFR 5 min. The experiment was repeated several times at each holding potential. Because the reagent was in excess, we determined the second order rate constant by fitting the peaks from the test applications of 5-HT to the following equation.I/I0=I∞/I0+(1−I∞/I0)exp(−kxt)Eq. 4 where the subscripts refer to zero time and infinite time (complete reaction), respectively, and the other parameters are as above. The calculations were performed as described previously (20Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, to determine the electrical distance (δ) from the bath solution to the site of reaction, the second order rate constant was plotted as a function of the holding potential (ψM) and fit to the following equation. k=k0exp(−zFδψM/RT)Eq. 5 where F is the Faraday constant, R is the molar gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and z is the algebraic charge on the reagent, with all other parameters as above. MTSET is poorly permeant through the 5-HT3 channel, but when it does reach the residues near the cytoplasmic end of the channel, it was assumed that the rate of reagent leaving to the cytoplasm was much greater than the rate of leaving to the extracellular bath. Thus in the case of E277C the apparent δ = (δ − 0.5) (20Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK293 cells maintained as described previously (21Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were washed with three changes of Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl) and fixed using ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (66 mmNa2HPO4, 38 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.2). To label the 5-HT3 receptor N-terminal domain pAb120 antiserum (21Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was used at 1:1000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline. Primary antibody incubation was overnight at 4 °C. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector) and fluorescein isothiocyanate avidin D (Vector) were used to detect bound antibody as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector), and immunofluorescence was observed using a Medical Research Council Radiance confocal microscope. Cysteine was substituted at 25 consecutive positions (Asp274–Asp298), one at a time, and the function of the mutants was tested following expression in oocytes. Twenty of the mutants expressed 5-HT-activated currents in Xenopus oocytes following injection of mRNA, indicating that in general the mutations were well tolerated. Application of 5-HT to oocytes expressing WT receptors resulted in rapid inward currents averaging 806 ± 71 nA (n = 6) at a holding potential of −60 mV. Typical responses are shown in Fig. 2 B. The average Imax for the mutants ranged from 131 nA ± 11 nA (n = 6, I295C) to 2976 ± 327 nA (n = 6, F281C). Dose-response curves were determined for all mutants, and the EC50 values are shown in Fig. 3. None of the mutants had an EC50 value more than 10-fold different from that of wild type receptors (1.4 ± 0.2 μm, n = 6). The expression of G288C, Y289C, S290C, F292C, and D298C mutant receptors were examined using several batches of cRNA, but no currents were detected during application of 5-HT up to a concentration of 1 mm (≈1000 × WT EC50). To rule out the possibility that the lack of functional channels for these mutants was due to spontaneously formed disulfide bonds, as was observed in the GABAA receptor at 17′ and 20′ positions (22Horenstein J. Wagner D. Czajkowski C. Akabas M. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), they were perfused with 10 mmdithiothreitol for 3 min; no 5-HT induced currents were observed following this treatment. We used immunofluorescent labeling of transiently transfected HEK293 cells to determine whether these mutants, which were also shown to be nonfunctional in HEK293 cells using calcium imaging techniques (11Hargreaves A.C. Taylor C.W. Lummis S.C.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1120-1128PubMed Google Scholar), formed cell surface receptors. Using the 5-HT3 selective antiserum, pAb120, raised against the extracellular domain (21Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), WT, and all of the mutants had a band of fluorescence on the cell surface when examined in nonpermeabilized cells. Untransfected cells were nonfluorescent as described previously (21Spier A.D. Wotherspoon G. Nayak S.V. Nichols R.A. Priestley J.V. Lummis S.C. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Typical results for G288C are shown in Fig. 2 A(inset). Thus the data suggest that the receptors were correctly synthesized, assembled and targeted to the cell surface, but the mutation resulted in loss of function. The mutants were examined for their susceptibility to react with MTSET applied in the presence of 5-HT by comparing the mean of a pair of responses to 5-HT before MTSET application to the mean of a pair of responses after MTSET application (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2). The effect of MTSET was examined by the effect on currents induced by 5-HT test pulses at EC50 and at maximal concentrations (Figs. 2 and4). For wild type 5-HT3Areceptors, a 1-min application of 1 mm MTSET with 10 μm 5-HT had no effect on the subsequent 5-HT-induced currents. Thus we infer either that MTSET does not react with the endogenous cysteines or that reaction with them has no functional effect. For the cysteine mutants, following a 1-min application of 1 mm MTSET with 10 μm 5-HT, the subsequent 5-HT EC50 currents were irreversibly altered with D274C, G276C, E277C, S280C, T284C, L285C, L287C, V291C, L293C, I294C, and I295C. With the majority of these residues MTSET interaction resulted in inhibition of the subsequent response. With two mutants, D274C and I295C, MTSET modification caused enhancement of the subsequent 5-HT currents. At two other positions, L287C and S280C, reaction with MTSET in the presence of 5-HT appeared to lock the channels in the open state. Thus following washout of the MTSET and 5-HT, the currents remained elevated and did not return to their initial base-line level even after 30 min of observation in the absence of MTSET and 5-HT. The mutants were examined for their susceptibility to react with the negatively charged MTSES in a similar way to MTSET, both at the EC50 and at a maximal concentration of 5-HT. For wild type 5-HT3A receptors a 1-min application of 10 mm MTSES with 10 μm5-HT had no effect on the subsequent 5-HT-induced currents (Fig. 5). In contrast to the inhibition of 5-HT-induced current after application of MTSET with 5-HT at V291C, L293C, and I294C, near the extracellular end of M2, application of MTSES with 5-HT locked the channels in the open state (Fig. 5). Thus following washout of the MTSES and 5-HT, the current remained elevated and did not return to its initial base-line level even after 30 min of observation. Application of 300 μm diltiazem to the MTSES locked-open channels formed by V291C reversibly blocked the current by 37% ± 9% (n = 4). Diltiazem (300 μm), however, had no effect on locked-open channels formed by L293C or I294C (data not shown). We determined the reaction rates with MTSET or MTSES for each of the accessible mutants. For mutants where reaction with MTSET caused inhibition of subsequent 5-HT-induced currents, the rates were measured using the procedure illustrated in Fig. 2 C, and the results were analyzed using Equation 3. For some mutants the voltage dependence of the reaction rates were also examined, and these data are shown in Fig. 6 (A and B). To determine the reaction rates of MTSES with V291C, L293C, and I294C, we used the protocol illustrated in Fig. 7 A of brief sequential applications of MTSES and 5-HT followed by test pulses of 5-HT. We analyzed the results by fitting the peak currents induced by the 5-HT test pulses as a function of cumulative exposure time to MTSES with an exponential decay function as in Equation 4 to calculate the pseudo-first order rate constant (Fig. 7 B). The second order rate constant was determined by dividing the pseudo-first order rate constant by the MTSES concentration (Fig. 7 C). These rate constants are slower than the reaction rates with cysteine in free solution (23Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) but are generally faster than the rates of reaction with cysteines found in protein clefts (e.g. in the binding site of the dopamine D2 receptor) (24Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The reaction rates of MTSET with L293C and I294C, however, were similar to the rates measured with cysteines in protein clefts (24Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We also examined these rate constants at a variety of different membrane potentials, and the data show that the reactions of MTSET with E277C, S280C, T284C, V291C, L293C, and I294C were voltage-dependent (Fig. 6,A and B) and that the reactions of V291C, L293C, and I294C with MTSES were voltage-dependent (Fig. 7 C). Because the sulfydryl reagents are charged and their reactions with cysteine are assumed to be fast, the rate-limiting step of their reaction with the thiolate is their movement into the ion channel; this should be voltage-dependent. The magnitude of the voltage dependence depends on the fraction of the electrical field through which the reagent moves to reach the cysteine (20Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Based on the voltage dependence of the reaction rates, we calculated the electrical distance (δ) from the bulk solution to the target cysteine residues using Equation 5, for those reactions whose rates were sufficiently high to use for this analysis. The results are shown in Fig. 6 C. The data reveal that the electrical distance is greatest toward the cytoplasmic end and decreases toward the extracellular end. We identified the water-accessible residues in and flanking the M2 segment of the 5-HT3A receptor subunit using the substituted cysteine accessibility method. Twenty of the twenty five cysteine substitution mutants were functional, and the EC50values of these mutant receptors did not vary from wild type by more than 10-fold. We infer that their structures were similar to the structure of wild type. Thus insertion of five cysteine residues (one for each subunit) was tolerated in these mutants. For 11 of the cysteine substitution mutants, application of MTSET in the presence of 5-HT irreversibly altered the subsequent 5-HT-induced currents, and we infer that the engineered cysteine, in at least one of the five subunits, covalently reacted with MTSET. We cannot determine whether reaction occurred with more than one of the five engineered cysteines that is present in each functional receptor. Because the rate of reaction of these sulfydryl reagents with a thiolate anion (RS−) is 5 × 109 faster than the rate with the uncharged thiol (RSH) (17Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and the extent of reaction of a sulfydryl reagent with an engineered cysteine directly correlates with the surface accessibility of the corresponding wild type (25Danielson M.A. Bass R.B. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32878-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we assume that the 5-HT3A cysteine mutants that react with MTSET and MTSES are on the water-accessible surface of the receptor. Thus in the presence of 5-HT, the residues Asp274, Gly276, Glu277, Ser280, Thr284, Leu285, Leu287, Val291, Leu293, Ile294, and Ile295 in the M2 transmembrane region are on the water-accessible surface of the protein at least part of the time. The voltage dependence of the MTSET reaction rates with many of these residues implies that the access pathway to them is via the ion channel. This supports our inference that at least some of these residues form the channel lining. In the presence of 5-HT the channels undergo transitions between the open, desensitized, and closed states. We cannot distinguish in which state reaction is occurring. We did not determine MTSET reactivity in the absence of 5-HT because without data on the spontaneous open probability of each mutant it is difficult to interpret closed state reactivity data with sulfydryl reagents. Five of the M2 segment cysteine substitution mutants did not form functional receptors when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The nonfunctional mutants G288C, Y289C S290C, F292C, and D298C appeared to be targeted to the cell surface, based on the immunofluorescent antibody labeling experiments in HEK 293 cells. This implies that they were correctly assembled. Thus for these five the mutations probably do not cause a gross change in receptor structure; rather the cysteine residues at these positions appeared to prevent channel opening. At most reactive positions, MTSET inhibited the subsequent 5-HT-induced currents. We do not know whether the inhibition of macroscopic currents occurred because of a change in gating kinetics or to a change in single channel conductance or both. Single channel studies of each mutant would be necessary to determine this. In two of the mutants, D274C and I295C, MTSET modification potentiated the subsequent currents. This is most likely due to a change in gating kinetics because placing a positive charge on the wall of a cation conducting channel is unlikely to increase single channel conductance. An alternative explanation suggested by preliminary data from another group who have also performed SCAM on the 5-HT3 receptor suggests that the potentiation at D274C may be due to relief of inhibition by extracellular magnesium ions (26Cruz H. Arrabit C. Slesinger P. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (. A): 336Google Scholar). MTSET, which is positively charged, reacted with 11 cysteine mutants along the entire length of the M2 segment, whereas the negatively charged MTSES only reacted at three positions near the extracellular end of M2. The most cytoplasmic of these is the 13′ position, V291C. This implies that both anions and cations can enter the extracellular end of the 5-HT3channel. At V291C the ratio of the reaction rate with MTSET to the rate with MTSES is ∼10 (Figs. 6 and 7), similar to the ratio of the reaction rates with 2-mercaptoethanol in free solution (23Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This implies that the access pathway to this residue is not charge-selective. Thus the residues lining the extracellular vestibule and the extracellular ring of charge (5Imoto K. Busch C. Sakmann B. Mishina M. Konno T. Nakai J. Bujo H. Mori Y. Fukuda K. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) do not serve a major role in the charge selectivity process. The fact that an anionic reagent reacted with M2 segment cysteine mutants to the 13′ level implies that the"

ONC has been tested in Phase I and Phase II human clinical trials for treatment of numerous solid tumors, including lung and pancreatic cancers (4Mikulski S.M. Grossman A.M. Carter P.W. Shogen K.

Oncol. 1995; 6: 889-897PubMed Google Scholar). In these trials, ONC appeared to have a favorable impact on the median survival time of the patients. Renal toxicity is dose-limiting but is reversible on discontinuation of treatment. The mechanism of ONC cytotoxicity is not well understood. It is evident, however, that enzymatic activity is required for ONC cytotoxicity because alkylation of ONC active site residues not only abates enzymatic activity but also renders the enzyme nontoxic (6Wu Y. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite sharing a common enzymatic activity, mammalian homologs of ONC, such as bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) and human pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase 1), are not cytotoxic. The creation of cytotoxic variants of RNase A and RNase 1 could help to reveal the mechanism of ribonuclease cytotoxicity. Moreover, endowing mammalian ribonucleases with cytotoxicity could yield cancer chemotherapeutics that lack the undesirable side effects of ONC.

In the presence of 10 μmall-trans-retinoic acid, the transferrin-RNase 1 conjugate is toxic to cells that express the transferrin receptor. Still, data on unconjugated monomeric variants of RNase A and RNase 1 are likely to yield the most relevant information on the mechanism of ONC cytotoxicity. Moreover, artificial dimers and ribonuclease conjugates require in vitro processing following initial purification or can be readily isolated only as multiple isoforms (or both). These limitations could complicate their use as chemotherapeutic agents and prevent their use in gene therapy protocols. The cytosol of most mammalian cells contains a potent inhibitor of RNase A and RNase 1. Ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) is a 50-kDa protein that binds to members of the pancreatic ribonuclease family with 1:1 stoichiometry and dissociation constants near or below 1 pm (14Suzuki M.

Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 621-658Crossref Google Scholar). This lack of inhibition could allow ONC to catalyze degradation of cellular RNA and consequently cause cell death. According to this hypothesis, RNase A and RNase 1 are not cytotoxic because RI efficiently abates their enzymatic activity within the cytosol. We suspected that by manipulating the interaction between RI and RNase 1, we could create a cytotoxic variant of RNase 1. Here, we describe amino acid substitutions in an RNase 1 surface loop which preserve conformational stability and ribonucleolytic activity but reduce inhibition by RI. In addition, we describe other amino acid substitutions in RNase 1 which affect conformational stability and ribonucleolytic activity. Finally, we report on the cytotoxicity of each RNase 1 variant. We find that monomeric RNase 1 can be transformed into a potent cytotoxin with only limited amino acid substitutions. This finding has significant implications for human cancer chemotherapy.

A synthetic cDNA that codes for Met(−1) RNase 1 was a generous gift from R. J. Youle (22Wu Y. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Gadina M. Mikulski S.M. De Lorenzo V. D'Alessio G. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17476-17481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This cDNA was excised from pET11d and inserted into pET22b(+) by using the BamHI and XbaI sites. The resulting plasmid was termed pHP-RNase. cDNAs coding the RNase 1 variants were made by site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-based mutagenesis of pHP-RNase. RNase 1 residues Lys41, Leu86, Asn88, Gly89, and Arg91 were replaced using site-directed mutagenesis. Oligonucleotide PL28 (5′-CGAAAGTGTTAACAGGCCT GCAACGACCA-3′) was used to replace the AAA codon of Lys41 with an AGG codon of arginine (reverse complement in bold) and to incorporate a translationally silent StuI site (underlined). Oligonucleotide BMK15 (5′-GTAAGCGCAGTTCGGGTAATCAGAATC ACGC GT TTCACGGCAGTCAGTGATATG-3′) incorporates four codon changes. This oligonucleotide replaces 1) the CUG codon of Leu86 with a GAA codon of glutamate, 2) the AAC codon of Asn88 with a CGU codon of arginine, 3) the GGU codon of Gly89 with a GAU codon of aspartate, and 4) the CGU codon of Arg91 with a GAU codon of aspartate (reverse complements in bold). In addition, oligonucleotide BMK15 incorporates a translationally silent MluI site (underlined). RNase 1 residues Arg4 and Val118 were replaced with cysteine residues using PCR-based mutagenesis. Oligonucleotide PL29 (5′-GGAGATATACATATGAAAGAATCT TGCGCAAAAAAATCCCAGCG-3′) replaces the CGU codon of Arg4 with a UGC codon of cysteine (bold) and incorporates translationally silent FspI (underlined) and NdeI (italics) sites. Oligonucleotide PL30a (5′-TCGGATCCCTACTAAGAGTCTTCAACGCTAGCGTCGAAATGACACGG-3′) replaces the GUU codon of Val118 with a UGU codon of cysteine (reverse complement in bold) and incorporates translationally silent NheI (underlined) and BamHI (italics) sites. The PCR product was band purified, treated with restriction endonucleases NdeI and BamHI, and inserted into a pET22b(+) fragment prepared with the same restriction endonucleases. The nucleotide sequence of all RNase 1 variants was confirmed with dye terminator cycle sequencing. RNase 1, its variants, and ONC were produced and purified using methods described previously (20Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the appropriate plasmid and grown in TB to anA600 of 2.0. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed with a French pressure cell. Inclusion bodies were recovered by centrifugation, then reduced and denatured. Proteins were folded by dropwise addition into 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m l-Arg, 3.0 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.6 mm oxidized glutathione at 10 °C. After a 15-h incubation, the solution was adjusted to pH < 7.0 and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Concentrated samples were applied to a Superdex G-75 gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mmsodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.02% w/v NaN3. Protein from the major peak was collected and applied to a Mono S cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNase 1 and its variants were eluted with a 0.3–0.6 m linear gradient of NaCl in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The concentration of RNase 1 and its variants was determined by UV spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of ε280 = 0.53 ml·mg−1·cm−1, which was calculated with the method of Gill and von Hippel (23Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient for RNase 1 differed by less than 1% when calculated with the method of Pace and co-workers (24Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar). Both methods predict that adding a disulfide bond to RNase 1 will change the extinction coefficient by less than 3%. Hence, the same extinction coefficient was used for all RNase 1 variants. The concentration of ONC was determined by UV spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient of ε280 = 0.87 ml·mg−1·cm−1 (20Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The conformational stability of RNase 1 and its variants was measured by recording the change in absorbance at 287 nm with increasing temperature (25Klink T.A. Woycechowsky K.J. Taylor K.M. Raines R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The temperature of the ribonuclease solution (0.1–0.2 mg/ml) in PBS was increased continually from 20 to 80 °C at 0.2 °C/min. TheA287 was recorded at 1 °C intervals and fit to a two-state model for denaturation, where the temperature at the midpoint of the transition is the melting temperature (Tm). Steady-state kinetic parameters for catalysis of RNA cleavage by RNase 1 and its variants were determined with a fluorogenic substrate, 6-FAM∼dArU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA (21Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3696-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This substrate consists of a single ribonucleotide embedded within three deoxyribonucleotides. When the substrate is intact, the 6-TAMRA group quenches the fluorescence of the 6-FAM group. Upon ribonucleolytic cleavage, fluorescence intensity increases by 180-fold. Assays were carried out in 2.00 ml of 0.1 m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.1m NaCl, 60 nm substrate, and 0.060–6.25 nm enzyme. Reaction progress was observed by recording fluorescence emission at 515 nm upon excitation at 490 nm. Values ofkcat/Km were determined by a linear least squares regression analysis of initial velocity data using Equation 1, kcat/Km=ΔF/ΔtFmax−F01[E]Eq. 1 where ΔF/Δt is the slope from the linear regression, Fmax is the maximal fluorescence intensity, F0 is initial fluorescence intensity, and [E] is the total enzyme concentration. Fmax was determined by adding RNase A to the assay mixture (to ∼0.1 μm) after the correlation coefficient for the least squares regression of the initial velocity data was r 2 > 0.99. Two assays were used to assess the binding of the RNase 1 variants to RI. The first was a qualitative gel-based assay, and the second was a quantitative spectrophotometric assay. RNase 1 variants were screened for ribonucleolytic activity in the absence and the presence of RI with an agarose gel-based assay as described previously (20Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Each ribonuclease (10 ng) was added to PBS containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 0, 20, or 40 units of RI. After a 10-min incubation on ice, 4 μg of 16 S and 23 S rRNA was added to the assay mixture. The assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then prepared for electrophoresis by the addition of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mmEDTA, 30% v/v glycerol, 0.25% w/v xylene cyanol FF, and 0.25% w/v bromphenol blue. Finally, the assay mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis through a 1% w/v agarose gel containing 0.4 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The intensity and position of the rRNA band correlate with the degree of ribonucleolytic activity. As ribonucleolytic activity in an assay mixture decreases, both the band intensity and its apparent Mr increase. Values of Ki for the RNase 1 variants were determined by using fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the steady-state rate of 6-FAM∼dArU(dA)2∼6-TAMRA cleavage in the presence of increasing concentrations of RI. RI was prepared and quantitated as described previously (26Bretscher L.E. Abel R.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9893-9896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Klink T.A. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17463-17467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in 2.00 ml of 0.10 m MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 nm substrate. After an initial 2–5-min equilibration, ribonuclease was added to the assay mixture (to 25–750 pm), and the steady-state rate of substrate cleavage was recorded. RI was then added to the assay mixture in a stepwise manner, and the steady-state rate was recorded after each addition. RI was added until the steady-state rate was <2% of that in the absence of RI. Values of Ki were calculated by fitting the steady-state rates to an equation that describes inhibition by tight binding inhibitors (28Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In all determinations, the ribonuclease concentration was less than the value determined forKi. The effect of RNase 1 variants on proliferation of transformed cells was measured as described previously (20Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar) with the following modification. RNase 1 variants were stored in PBS containing 0.1% w/v human serum albumin and were sterile filtered before being added to the cells. After a 44-h incubation with the ribonucleases, cells were treated with [methyl- 3H]thymidine for 4 h. Cellular DNA was recovered, and its radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Results are expressed as the percentage of [methyl- 3H]thymidine incorporated into the DNA of cells treated with PBS containing 0.1% w/v human serum albumin but no exogenous ribonuclease. Data are the average of triplicate determinations with each ribonuclease concentration. Cytotoxicity assays were repeated at least twice, with no significant variation in the results. To determine whether the RNase 1 variants act as cytotoxic agents or, alternatively, as cytostatic agents, cells were stained with trypan blue after exposure to the ribonucleases. Briefly, 5.0 × 104 K-562 cells were incubated for 72 h with 5 μm ONC, 10 μm RNase 1, or 10 μm S-S/ERDD RNase 1. The cells were then stained with 0.02% w/v trypan blue in PBS. The total number of cells and the number of cells stained by trypan blue were determined by visual inspection using light microscopy. Representative cells from each ribonuclease treatment were photographed using a Carl Zeiss axioscope (Germany) equipped with a Princeton Instruments digital camera. Our goal was to create variants of RNase 1 which are cytotoxic. First, we replaced amino acid residues in RNase 1 to reduce the affinity for RI. Second, we replaced an active site residue to reduce further the affinity for RI but at the expense of ribonucleolytic activity. Third, we incorporated a non-native disulfide bond into RNase 1 to enhance conformational stability. Our design was intentionally restricted to monomeric RNase 1 variants containing only the 20 natural amino acids. This restriction facilitates the production of the variants in E. coli. Further, a cytotoxic RNase 1 variant so restricted may be incorporated directly into a gene therapy regimen. The three types of amino acid changes are described below. RNase A residues 85–94 comprise a solvent-exposed surface loop flanked by half-cystine residues. In the structure of the crystalline RI·RNase A complex, this loop makes many contacts with RI (29Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 30Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1028-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Substitution of RNase A residue Gly88 with arginine (G88R RNase A) lessens inhibition by RI because of a steric and electrostatic strain introduced into the RI·RNase A complex (20Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The structure of wild-type RNase 1 and its complex with RI is unknown. The structure of RNase 1 variants reveals that elements of secondary structure are conserved between RNase 1 and RNase A (31Pous J. Canals A. Terzyan S.S. Guasch A. Benito A. Ribó M. Vilanova M. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Pous J. Mallorqui-Fernandez G. Peracaula R. Terzyan S.S. Futami J. Tada H. Yamada H. Seno M. de Llorens R. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Coll M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The conformations of RNase 1 surface loops, including residues 85–94, do, however, deviate significantly from their bovine counterparts. Moreover, the 85–94 loop of RNase 1 appears to be highly flexible. Vilanova and co-workers (31Pous J. Canals A. Terzyan S.S. Guasch A. Benito A. Ribó M. Vilanova M. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have suggested that these features of RNase 1 may exclude a strategy analogous to that used to create the cytotoxic G88R RNase A variant. Nevertheless, we attempted to introduce steric and electrostatic strain into the RI·RNase 1 complex by altering the 85–94 loop. First, we created the N88R variant of RNase 1. We found that N88R RNase 1 binds to RI with high affinity (data not shown), consistent with results described by Batra and co-workers (16Gaur D. Swaminathan S. Batra J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24978-24984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and by Vilanova and co-workers (31Pous J. Canals A. Terzyan S.S. Guasch A. Benito A. Ribó M. Vilanova M. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) for the N88R/G89S variant of RNase 1. Consequently, we resorted to multiple substitutions (Table I). The L86E substitution was added to make the RNase 1 residues that flank Cys84 identical to those of RNase A (Fig.1). Our hope was that this change would likewise equate the three-dimensional structures near Cys84. The G89D and R91D substitutions were made to introduce additional steric and electrostatic strain into the RI·RNase 1 complex. Hereafter, the variant that contains the L86E, N88R, G89D, and R91D substitutions is referred to as ERDD RNase 1.Table IAmino acid substitutions in human pancreatic ribonucleaseSubstitutionSecondary structure1-aFrom the structure of crystalline RNase A (62).RI contact1-bFrom the structure of the crystalline RI·RNase A complex (29, 30).R4Cα-HelixNoneK41Rβ-StrandTyr430, Asp431L86Eβ-StrandLys316N88RSurface loopTrp257, Trp259, Tyr433G89DSurface loopGlu202, Trp257, Trp259R91DSurface loopTrp257, Glu283, Trp314V118Cβ-StrandNone1-a From the structure of crystalline RNase A (62Wlodawer A.

Open table in a new tab RNase A residue Lys41 is in the enzymic active site. The role of Lys41 in catalysis is to donate a hydrogen bond to the rate-limiting transition state (33Messmore J.M. Fuchs D.N. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8057-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Arginine can replace Lys41 in RNase A catalysis, albeit with a 102-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (33Messmore J.M. Fuchs D.N. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 8057-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 34Trautwein K. Holliger P. Stackhouse J. Benner S.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Lys41 makes van der Waals contacts with RI residues Tyr430 and Asp431 in the crystalline RI·RNase A complex (29Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 30Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1028-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Adding the K41R substitution to G88R RNase A reduces the affinity for RI by 20-fold (26Bretscher L.E. Abel R.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9893-9896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, K41R/G88R RNase A is 3-fold more toxic to K-562 cells than is G88R RNase A (26Bretscher L.E. Abel R.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9893-9896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lys41 is conserved in RNase 1 (Fig. 1). Thus, we added the K41R substitution to ERDD RNase 1 to observe the impact of a decreased susceptibility to inactivation by RI but a loss of catalytic efficiency on the cytotoxic activity of ERDD RNase 1. The cytotoxic activity of a ribonuclease correlates with its conformational stability (27Klink T.A. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17463-17467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hence, we incorporated a non-native disulfide bond into ERDD RNase 1 in an attempt to increase its conformational stability and thereby its cytotoxicity. Previously, we and others described a particular variant of RNase A and RNase 1 in which Ala4 and Val118 are each replaced with cysteine (27Klink T.A. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17463-17467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 35Futami J. Tada H. Seno M. Ishikami S. Yamada H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These cysteine residues form a disulfide bond that increases the conformational stability and decreases the proteolytic susceptibility of each protein. The RNase 1 variant that includes the Cys4-Cys118 disulfide bond is designated with the prefix S-S. RNase 1 and its variants were produced in E. coli. All proteins eluted as a single species during cation exchange chromatography and migrated as single bands of appropriate Mr during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). RNase 1 and its variants also migrated as single bands on zymogram electrophoresis (36Kim J.-S. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 37Bravo J.

Our expression and purification protocol yielded ∼20 mg of wild-type RNase 1 and 5–20 mg of the RNase 1 variants/liter of E. coli growth medium. The melting temperature (Tm) of RNase 1 was 56 °C (TableII). This value is slightly higher than that determined by Vilanova and co-workers (38C"

Unfortunately, the structural basis of this phenomenon is not fully understood. Over 25 years of study have produced two general models of apoA-I structure in discoidal HDL complexes. The “belt” model states that the amphipathic helices of apoA-I are aligned perpendicular to the acyl chains of the lipid bilayer, whereas the “picket fence” model argues that the helices are aligned parallel with the acyl chains. To distinguish between the two models, various single tryptophan mutants of apoA-I were analyzed in reconstituted, discoidal HDL particles composed of phospholipids containing nitroxide spin labels at various positions along the acyl chain. We have previously used this technique to show that the orientation of helix 4 of apoA-I is most consistent with the belt model. In this study, we performed additional control experiments on helix 4, and we extended the results by performing the same analysis on the remaining 22-mer helices (helices 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10) of human apoA-I. For each helix, two different mutants were produced that each contained a probe Trp occurring two helical turns apart. In the belt model, the two Trp residues in each helix should exhibit maximal quenching at the same nitroxide group position on the lipid acyl chains. For the picket fence model, maximal quenching should occur at two different levels in the bilayer. The results show that the majority of the helices are in an orientation that is consistent with a belt model, because most Trp residues localized to a position about 5 Å from the center of the bilayer. This study corroborates a belt hypothesis for the majority of the helices of apoA-I in phospholipid discs.

It has been demonstrated repeatedly that levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)1and its major protein constituent apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) are inversely correlated with the incidence of heart disease (1Schaefer E.J.

Apo-AI, a 28-kDa protein made up of 11- and 22-mer amphipathic helices (Ref. 2McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1977; 267: 465-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 3Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 103-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), is critical to the formation and stability of the HDL particle in circulation. The process of reverse cholesterol transport is thought to remove excess cholesterol from extra-hepatic tissues such as the arterial wall and return it to the liver for processing (4Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 5Glomset J.A. J.

In the lipid poor form, it can interact with the cell surface under the control of the ATP-binding cassette A1 transporter (6Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G.

Once apoA-I accumulates phospholipids and cholesterol from the cell surface, it likely forms discoidal complexes that interact with enzymes such as lecithin:cholesterol acetyl transferase and cholesterol ester transfer protein to form the spherical HDL particles commonly found in plasma. These are the particles that are thought to deliver cholesterol to the liver and steroidogenic tissues through interaction with scavenger receptor type B class I (7Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). ApoA-I has a dynamic structure that allows it to perform its functions. Numerous attempts have been made to determine the arrangement of the amphipathic helices in nascent HDL discs, because this appears to be a critical intermediate in reverse cholesterol transport.

However, other computer models derived from a crystal structure of a lipid free fragment of apoA-I suggest the possibility of a “belt” model (13Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 14Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Klon A.E. Sheldahl C.J. Hellinger M. De Loof H. Harvey S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31755-31758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In this case, the helices of apoA-I are arranged perpendicular to the phospholipid bilayer. Further support for this model comes from a recent study that employed oriented polarized internal reflection infrared spectroscopy (15Koppaka V. Silvestro L. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Axelsen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14541-14544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to show that, on average, most of the helical regions are consistent with a belt orientation in phospholipid discs. Using a new approach that capitalized on the fluorescence of introduced tryptophan residues and the quenching ability of nitroxide spin-labeled phospholipids, our laboratory experimentally determined the orientation of helix 4 in apoA-I (16Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two different positions were chosen in the helix, one at the center (residue 108) and one near the C-terminal end of the helix (residue 115), for making single Trp mutants of apoA-I. Nitroxide labels on phospholipid acyl chains were placed at five different depths in separate reconstituted HDL (rHDL) particles containing each of these mutants. The depth of each Trp was determined by a modification of the parallax analysis commonly used to study membrane spanning proteins (17Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the belt model, the Trp residues in both mutants would be maximally quenched at the same level in the bilayer; in the picket fence model the Trp residues would be quenched at different levels. We found that both Trp residues were maximally quenched at the same level in the bilayer (about 5–6 Å from the bilayer center) as predicted for a belt model (16Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This was in direct contrast to synthetic transmembrane peptides in which similarly placed Trp residues were measured in the expected picket fence orientation in vesicles. In the current study, we report additional control experiments to unambiguously show that helix 4 cannot be in a picket fence orientation by studying additional points along the helix. We then used the same approach to measure the orientation of all remaining 22-amino acid helices in apoA-I. The results show that almost all of the helices orient in some form of a belt-like model. This study identifies the specific regions within the molecule that exist in the belt orientation and lays the foundation for further work aimed at determining the tertiary arrangement of apoA-I molecules on discoidal HDL particles. 1-palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), the nitroxide spin probes 1-palmitoyl, 2-stearoyl(X-DOXYL)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (where X = 5, 7, 10, 12, or 16), and 1-oleoyl, 2-(12-NBD)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). The atomic phosphorus standard was obtained from Sigma. IgA protease was obtained from Mobitec (Marco Island, FL). All other reagents were of the highest quality available. Human proapoA-I cDNA in the pET30 (Novagen, Madison, WI) vector was used to generate single Trp mutants. Each of the five naturally occurring Trp residues (position −3 in the pro-segment and positions 8, 50, 72, and 108) in proapoA-I were converted to Phe using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), yielding a mutant that contained no Trp residues ([email protected]φ). The [email protected]n nomenclature states that a Trp residue has been introduced at position n. We have previously demonstrated that these substitutions do not have major effects on the structure or function of the protein (18Davidson W.S. Arnvig-McGuire K. Kennedy A. Kosman J. Hazlett T.L. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14387-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To produce mutants of mature apoA-I that lacked the pro-segment, we added an IgA protease cleavage site to our expression vector between the pro-segment and the beginning of the mature gene. 2S. E. Panagotopulos, J. N. Maiorano, E. Horace, and W. S. Davidson, manuscript in preparation. A His tag was included on the extreme N terminus of the construct. Cleavage of the expression product at the IgA protease site removed the pro-segment and His tag, leaving a Thr-Pro on the N terminus of the mature apoA-I protein. [email protected]φ was used as a template to insert a Trp residue at a position in the center of an amphipathic helix and, in a separate mutant, at a residue distal to the center of the helix for each of the seven 22-mer helices of apoA-I to be studied (helix 1: [email protected],[email protected]; helix 2: [email protected],[email protected]; helix 5: [email protected],[email protected]; helix 6: [email protected],[email protected]; helix 7: [email protected],[email protected]; and helix 8: [email protected],[email protected]; helix 10: [email protected],[email protected]). Two additional mutants were created in helix 4 at the far N-terminal end ([email protected] and [email protected]) for the described control experiments. Polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was performed directly in the pET30 expression vector. The sequences were verified on an Applied Biotechnology System DNA sequencer, University of Cincinnati DNA core. The resulting constructs were transfected into BL-21 (DE3)Escherichia coli cells (Novagen). The overexpression of the mutant apoA-I was performed using freshly transfected cells as described previously (18Davidson W.S. Arnvig-McGuire K. Kennedy A. Kosman J. Hazlett T.L. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14387-14395Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After harvesting, the cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.15 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% NaN3 (standard Tris buffer). The cells were lysed for 20 min at room temperature using B-PER lysis detergent (Pierce) at 4 ml of detergent solution for every 100 ml of bacterial cell culture. The soluble cell contents were applied to a His-bind column (Novagen) and eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The His-tagged proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, and lyophilized. Lyophilized proteins were solubilized in 3 mguanidine HCl and dialyzed into standard Tris buffer, and the His tag was then removed by cleavage with 1:5000 (w:w) IgA protease at 37 °C for 16 h. The His tag was removed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a phenyl Sepharose HiTrap (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column resulting in the final mature apoA-I protein. The proteins prepared by this method were >95% pure as visualized by SDS electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue, and the yields were about 3–5 mg of protein/100 ml of original culture. rHDL particles were prepared as described previously (20Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) using POPC, mutant apoA-I, and spin-labeled phospholipids. All phospholipid stock solutions were assayed before the reconstitution by the phosphorus method of Sokolof and Rothblat (21Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Initial lipid to protein molar ratios were 85:15:1 (POPC:DOXYL-DSPC:apoA-I) to make 98 Å particles. For each mutant, a set of particles was reconstituted without the spin-labeled phospholipids. Any unreacted protein and vesicular structures were removed by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (22Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V.

Previous studies have ensured that the gel filtration step did not change the concentration of quencher within the particles (16Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The phosphorus assay and the Markwell modification of the Lowry protein assay (23Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar) determined the final lipid and protein concentrations. Particle hydrodynamic diameters were measured by gradient native polyacrylamide electrophoresis (PhastSystem; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (22Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The secondary structure content of the apoA-I in the rHDL particles was estimated by circular dichroism at 222 nm (Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter) (24Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25839-25847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All fluorescence measurements were performed on a Photon Technology International Quantamaster spectrometer in photon counting mode. The emission and excitation band passes were 3.0 nm. The excitation wavelength for all Trp studies was 295 nm to minimize the contribution of tyrosine fluorescence in apoA-I. The samples at 0.075 mg/ml in standard Tris buffer for all studies were measured at 25 °C in a semi-micro quartz cuvette. The emission spectra from 305 to 360 nm were corrected for the background fluorescence of buffer alone. The parallax method for determining the depth of penetration of a fluorophore into a lipid bilayer was derived by Chattopadhyay and London (25Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) from classical relationships of static quenchers to randomly distributed fluorophores. The method depends on distance-dependent quenching. The differences in fluorescence intensities of the fluorophore in the presence of known concentrations of nitroxide quencher groups at known locations in a phospholipid acyl chain are used to calculate the relative depth of the fluorophore relative to the quenchers (see Ref.16Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar for a detailed discussion of the method theory). The distance of the Trp from the center of the bilayer (Zcf) is given by the following equation. Zcf=Lcs+[−ln(Fs/Fd)/πC−Lds2]/2LdsEq. 1 where Fs is the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the shallow quencher, Fd is the same for the deep quencher, Lcs is the distance from the center of the bilayer to the shallow quencher,Lds is the distance between the shallow and deep quenchers, and C is the concentration of the quencher molecules/Å2. Equation 1 holds when the Trp residue is quenched by nitroxide groups shallow in the membrane. When the Trp is buried deep within the membrane, it is subjected to quenching from groups in the opposite side of the lipid bilayer. For this situation, a second relationship is required to account for trans-bilayer quenching. Zcf=Lcdâˆ’[ln((Fs/Fo)2/(Fd/Fo))/Ï€C)âˆ’2Lds2+4Lcd2)/4(Lds+Lcd)]Eq. 2 where Fo is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of quencher, Lcd is the distance from the center of the bilayer to the deep quencher, andLds is the distance between the shallow and deep quenchers. Equation 2 was used in this study whenever a Trp residue was determined to be <5 Å from the center of the membrane by Equation1. The quenching pair of C-5 and C-12 was chosen for our calculations because these two quenchers gave the largest difference in quenching in previous studies. In addition, Abrams and London (17Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have published detailed information on the quenching of 12-NBD phospholipids using the C-5/C-12 pair that allowed the calibration of our particular batches of spin-labeled lipid to estimate Trp depths as accurately as possible (16Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine the orientation of each putative helix of apoA-I, we placed Trp residues at two positions within each helix in separate mutants. ApoA-I has eight generally accepted, 22-amino acid, amphipathic helices (helices 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10). If one assigns the first residue of each helical repeat as position 1 and the last as position 22, then positions 10 and 17 were probed for each helix as in our preliminary study (16Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The “central” Trp at position 10 is expected to be about 1.5 Å from the theoretical center of the helix (assuming the center to be 22/2 = 11 and 1.5 Å of distance per residue in an ideal helix). The “distal” Trp at position 17 is two turns along the helix toward the C terminus and theoretically about 9–10 Å from the helix center. These positions have been selected because they are both in the center of the helical hydrophobic face when one looks down the long helical axis and are more than 3 residues away from the extreme ends of the helix. The latter point is important because if there are turn sequences between the helices as predicted by the picket fence model, then both of these positions should be far enough away from the ends so as not to participate in the turns. Thus, we anticipated accurate depth measurements for Trp residues at both positions, regardless of the orientation of the helix with respect to the bilayer. Using this approach, we previously demonstrated that both the central and distal Trp probes in helix 4 of apoA-I were located about 5–6 Å from the center of the bilayer, a result consistent with the belt model. However, the possibility remained that our results could also be consistent with the picket fence model if helix 4 can move upward with respect to the bilayer. This would have the effect of pulling the central Trp away from (and the distal Trp toward) the center of the bilayer with respect to their original positions (Fig. 1). To address this possibility, we constructed two additional mutants that contained Trp residues at positions 3 and 6 in the helical nomenclature (positions 101 and 104 in apoA-I). Although these two residues are close to the N-terminal end of the helix, they are still situated on the hydrophobic face and are 1 and 2 turns N-terminal to the central Trp residue at position 108, respectively (Fig.2). These two mutants exhibited levels of expression and secondary structure characteristics similar to those of the other mutants created for this particular helix. The fluorescence intensity of each Trp residue in the absence of quencher was compared in the presence of nitroxide-labeled phospholipids in rHDL particles. Fig. 3 demonstrates that both mutants were minimally quenched near the shallow quencher (position C-5) but were increasingly quenched as the nitroxide group was moved deeper into the bilayer. Table I shows that the depth of both Trp residues was about 5–6 Å from the bilayer center, essentially the same position as calculated for the 108 and 115 mutants. The observation of four separate points along the helix at a similar bilayer depth can only be explained by a belt model, assuming that helix 4 is a contiguous helix. With this result established, we generated mutants for the remaining helices in apoA-I at helical positions 10 and 17 and measured the relative bilayer depth of each probe.Figure 2Relative positions of the introduced Trp residues within helix 4 of apoA-I. The isolated helix 4 is taken from the x-ray crystal structure published by Borhani et al.(13Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Notice that all four residues are aligned along the hydrophobic face of the helix.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Nitroxide lipid quenching pattern for [email protected] and [email protected] mutants in 98 Å rHDL particles. The rHDL particles were prepared with each mutant at a molar ratio of 85:15:1 mol:mol:mol (POPC:DOXYL-X PSPC:apoA-I). The 98 Å size classes were purified by gel filtration chromatography, characterized, and used for fluorescence studies at concentrations of 75 μg of apoA-I/ml in standard Tris buffer. The emission spectra were collected from 305–360 nm, and the fluorescence intensity (F) for the DOXYL containing samples at the λmax was plotted as a ratio of the fluorescence of the same particle without quenching groups present (Fo). The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. The labels near each data point indicate the carbon number of the phospholipid acyl chain that contained the quenching group.

Open table in a new tab To limit the total number of complexes generated in this study to a reasonable number, we produced three complexes/mutant (one containing no nitroxide, DOXYL-5, and DOXYL-12) rather than using all available nitroxide positions as in our previous studies. These are sufficient for calculation of the depth parameter (17Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The initial particle reconstitution reaction conditions were selected to produce primarily 98 Å particles with 90–100 molecules of phospholipid and three molecules of apoA-I/complex. This type of particle was used because of its ease of reconstitution and extreme stability in our hands versus those that contain two molecules of apoA-I. Each particle was studied in triplicate from at least two independent preparations of mutant protein. As in our previous study, we expended significant effort to confirm that the introduction of the probe residues did not have adverse effects on the structure of the mutant particles relative to those made with the native protein. We demonstrated that the presence of the nitroxide labels in the rHDL particles did not affect the structure of the associated protein or the size and morphology of the disc (16Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17374-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the current study, all mutants formed rHDL particles of similar size (about 98 ± 4Å) as measured by native PAGE (Fig.4) and exhibited similar retention times on a calibrated Superdex 200 gel filtration column (data not shown). A representative selection of these particles is shown in the native PAGE gels in Fig. 4. It is clear that neither the introduction of the Trp residues at various positions across the molecule nor the presence of the spin labels at each position affected the diameter of the particles. This was the case for all the mutants used in this study, even for the relatively poorly conserved substitutions such as Ala residues that were changed to Trp residues. We occasionally saw a slight increase in diameter of rHDL particles generated with human plasma apoA-I versus the recombinant form of the protein (on the order of a 2–4 Å). However, this effect is inconsistent between preparations and likely reflected differences in the nature of the protein preparation rather than a significant structural difference between the two types of apoA-I. All particles used were of similar phospholipid to protein molar composition (averaging 96 ± 11:1) to each other and to previously published particles generated with human plasma apoA-I (11Jonas A.

The process of gut differentiation is regulated by a number of factors including hormones, growth factors, cytokines, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions (2Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin.

We have demonstrated previously that targeted inactivation of the transcription factor Foxl1 (previously Fkh6) results in a dramatically altered gut epithelium, characterized by branched and elongated glands in the stomach and lengthened villi in the jejunum (5Kaestner K.H.

These findings provided the first genetic evidence for a regulatory cascade between the mesenchyme and the epithelium in the mammalian gut. Thus far, the molecular mechanisms of Foxl1action in the gastrointestinal tract have not been elucidated. Among the signaling systems that might be regulated by Foxl1is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This pathway plays a central role in the regulation of gastrointestinal proliferation, and mutations in this pathway have been found in greater than 80% of colorectal cancers (6Smith K. Bui T.D. Poulsom R. Kaklamanis L. Williams G. Harris A.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The Wnt/β-catenin pathway consists of many components (for review, see Ref. 8Seidensticker M.J. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The secreted Wnt proteins bind to the cell-surface frizzled receptors, which contain seven transmembrane domains. In the off state of the pathway, a multiprotein complex containing glycogen synthetase-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, followed by ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of β-catenin by the proteosome. As a consequence, the cytoplasmic and nuclear concentrations of β-catenin are low. In contrast, in the on state of the pathway, Wnt binding to the frizzled receptors activates the cytoplasmic phosphoprotein dishevelled, which leads to inhibition of β-catenin phosphorylation through glycogen synthetase-3β by a still unknown mechanism. Hypophosphorylated β-catenin cannot be ubiquinated and therefore accumulates in the cytoplasm and subsequently translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional activator by associating with HMG-box DNA-binding proteins (TCF and LEF factors). Activation of β-catenin/TCF target genes including cyclin D1 ultimately results in increased proliferation of the Wnt target cells. The elucidation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has provided an elegant explanation as to why mutations found in components of the pathway, like APC and β-catenin, lead to cancer in humans. Recent evidence indicates that the Wnt pathway can also be modulated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)1 (9Cumberledge S. Reichsman F.

Nature. 1999; 400: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated through a gene targeting experiment that the HSPG Syndecan-1 is required for Wnt-1 induced mammary tumorigenesis in mice, pointing to the importance of the HSPGs as co-receptors for Wnt proteins in epithelial proliferation in mammals. In the present study, we show that the abnormal gastrointestinal architecture in Foxl1 mutant mice is caused primarily by an increase in epithelial proliferation. This altered proliferation rate is correlated with an activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway as demonstrated by increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin. We show that an increase in HSPG levels is associated with this activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, providing the first evidence for the involvement of HSPGs in gastrointestinal proliferation. A fragment of the mouse Syndecan-1 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed as described previously (16Duncan S.A. Nagy A. Chan W. Development. 1997; 124: 279-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the use of RNA extracted from mouse small intestine. The following primer pair was used for amplification: Sdc-1A 5′-CTTCTTCTCTGGACTGGTGGT-3′ and Sdc-1B 5′-GGCCTGTAAAACCTTGGCTGA-3′. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was carried out for 32 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing of the primers at 60 °C for 45 s, and reaction extension at 72 °C for 90 s. A 220-base pair fragment extending from positions 61 to 281 of Sdc-1 was subcloned into the EcoRV site of Bluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla CA). 60-day-old wild type orFoxl1 mutant mice (F1 hybrids of 129SvEv and C57Bl6 strains) were injected with 120 mg/kg BrdUrd and 12 mg/kg 5-fluoro-deoxyuracil 1.5 h prior to sacrifice. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were applied to probe-on plus slides and prepared for immunofluorescence. Sections were dewaxed and rehydrated in water. Slides were immersed in 0.01 m citrate acid buffer (pH 6.0) and microwaved to boil for 7 min, then cooled, washed in PBS, and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 10% normal goat serum (Vector). Mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd (1:500, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted in 10% normal goat serum applied on the slides and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a moist chamber. After washing with PBS, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:25, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted in 10% normal goat serum, applied on the BrdUrd slides, and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in a moist chamber. Tissue sections were counterstained with 0.01% Evan's blue as described previously (17Beaulieu J.F. Vachon P.H. Chartrand S. Anat. Embryol. 1991; 183: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and mounted with Vectashield (Vector). Images were captured on a Nikon Microphot FX microscope. BrdUrd-labeled nuclei were counted manually in a blinded fashion and care was taken only to evaluate glands or crypts that were sectioned longitudinally. Frozen tissues from 60-day-old wild type or Foxl1 mutant mice were embedded in O.C.T. (Miles Tek) and sectioned as described elsewhere (17Beaulieu J.F. Vachon P.H. Chartrand S. Anat. Embryol. 1991; 183: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tissues were fixed in ethanol (10 min at −20 °C) before immunostaining, washed in PBS, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in protein blocking agent (Immunotech). Mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin (1:500, Transduction Laboratories) and rat monoclonal anti-Syndecan-1 (1:1000, Research Diagnostics Inc.) antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 10% nonfat dry milk, applied on the slides, and incubated 1 h at room temperature in a moist chamber. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:25, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), were diluted in 10% nonfat dry milk and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a moist chamber. Tissue sections were counterstained with 0.01% Evan's blue as described previously (17Beaulieu J.F. Vachon P.H. Chartrand S. Anat. Embryol. 1991; 183: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and mounted with Vectashield (Vector). Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins were isolated from stomach and jejunum of 75-day-old Foxl1mice as described previously (18Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). For β-catenin Western blot analysis, 15 μg of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane for 75 min at 4 °C. For Syndecan-1 Western blot analysis, 50 μg of total protein extract was separated by a Nupage 4–12% bis-tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane for 75 min at room temperature. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS and 0.1% Tween overnight at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated 3 h with the primary antibody. The following antibodies were used: α-tubulin mouse monoclonal IgG1 raised against the C-terminal region of sea urchin protein (Sigma) diluted 1:1000, YY1 mouse monoclonal IgG1 raised against the full-length human protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:100, β-catenin mouse monoclonal IgG1 raised against the C-terminal region of mouse protein (Transduction Laboratories) diluted 1:1000, and CD138 (Syndecan-1/plasma cells) rat monoclonal IgG1 raised against the core protein region of mouse protein (Research diagnostic, Inc.) diluted 1:500. The membrane was washed five times for 10 min in PBS with 0.1% Tween and incubated with the secondary antibody anti-mouse/horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or for Syndecan-1, anti-rat/horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 45 min at room temperature. The membrane was then washed five times for 10 min in PBS with 0.1% Tween and developed with the ECL-Plus Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA was extracted from gastrointestinal tissues using Tri-reagent-LS (Molecular Research Center) following the manufacturer's instructions. Ribonuclease (RNase) protection assays were performed as described previously (5Kaestner K.H. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Transcripts were synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase to yield probes that protect a 220-nucleotide region for Syndecan-1. As a control for total RNA integrity, a 156-nucleotide riboprobe for TATA box binding protein was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase. Mice lacking the winged helix transcription factor Foxl1 (previously Fkh6) show dramatic alterations in the architecture of the gastrointestinal tract (5Kaestner K.H. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).Foxl1 mutant mice exhibit delayed formation of gastric glands and intestinal villi during fetal development. Later in life, these mice show thickening of the gastric mucosa with branching of the gastric glands and formation of mucin-filled cysts. In addition, the villi in the small intestine are lengthened and the crypt compartment is dramatically expanded. The lengthening of the villi in the intestine and the thickening of the gastric mucosa in these mice could, in principle, be caused by an increased rate of epithelial cell proliferation and/or a decreased rate of cell migration. We addressed this question by in vivo pulse labeling of cells in S-phase with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). To assess the rate of epithelial cell migration, mice were sacrificed 48 h post-injection. By this time, labeled cells have migrated up the crypt-villus axis as ordered cohort of cells, and the distance from the crypt to the leading edge of the marked cells provides an accurate measure of the distance traveled by the cells labeled at the time of injection. No difference in the rate of cell migration was found between Foxl1 mutant mice and their control littermates (data not shown). To determine the rate of epithelial proliferation, mice were sacrificed shortly (1.5 h) post-injection when only actively cycling cells (S-phase) would be labeled. As shown in Fig. 1, the number of proliferating cells in the epithelium is dramatically increased in the stomach (Fig. 1 B) and jejunum (Fig. 1 D) ofFoxl1 mutant mice. Furthermore, the proliferating cells were found to be scattered throughout the glands in the mutant stomach (Fig.1 B) in contrast to the wild type littermates (Fig.1 A), where the dividing cells were found to be restricted to the neck region of the glands. In the jejunum of wild type mice, the proliferating cells were localized to the base of the crypt (Fig.1 C). In contrast, proliferating cells in the mutant were also detected in the upper part of the crypt near the crypt/villus junction where cells normally acquire their final differentiated phenotype (Fig. 1 D). These results demonstrate that epithelial cell proliferation but not migration is controlled by the transcription factor Foxl1. Having established that increased epithelial proliferation, not altered cell migration, is the cause for the gastrointestinal malformations in Foxl1 mutant mice, we investigated the regulatory pathways that might be impacted byFoxl1. We hypothesized that Foxl1 normally limits the signaling of a pathway that, when active, leads to epithelial cell proliferation. We considered the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as a possible target of Foxl1 as it has been shown to play a central role in gastrointestinal proliferation and cancer (7Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar,19Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 20Cadigan K.M. Nusse R.

Dev. 1998; 8: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway leads to accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus where it participates in transcription of pro-proliferative genes such as c-myc andcyclin D1 through its interaction with the TCF/LEF factors (23Clevers H. van de Wetering M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 485-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 24Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 25He T.C.

To test our hypothesis that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is chronically activated in Foxl1 mutant mice we used indirect immunofluorescence to determine nuclear localization of β-catenin as an indicator of the activated state of the Wnt pathway. Overall β-catenin levels observed at low magnification, which mainly reflect β-catenin contained in the adherens junctions, were comparable in the stomach of wild type and Foxl1 mutant mice (Fig.2, A and C). However, at higher magnification we found a dramatic change in the subcellular localization of β-catenin (Fig. 2, B andD). Foxl1 mutant mice had a larger number of nuclei with β-catenin staining, indicating that theWnt/β-catenin pathway had indeed been activated in these cells. A similar increase in nuclear β-catenin staining was also seen in the jejunum of Foxl1 mutant mice, confirming the correlation between increased proliferation and increased nuclear localization of β-catenin (data not shown). To quantify the observed increase in nuclear β-catenin, we performed Western blot analysis on cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from Foxl1 mutant mice and their littermate controls (Fig.3 A). We found a significant increase in nuclear β-catenin in the stomach and jejunum (2- and 2.3-fold, respectively) of Foxl1 mutant mice (Fig.3 B) confirming the immunofluorescence results, while cytoplasmic β-catenin was unchanged. Thus, theWnt/β-catenin pathway is activated in Foxl1mutant mice, explaining, at least in part, the increased rate of epithelial proliferation observed in the gastrointestinal tract of these mice. We have therefore established the first link between a mesenchymal factor and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the gastrointestinal tract.Figure 3Quantitative analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic β-catenin levels in stomach and jejunum of Foxl1 mice. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts (15 μg) from stomach and jejunum of 75-day-old wild type control and Foxl1 mutant animals were analyzed for β-catenin levels by immunoblotting (A). An increase of nuclear β-catenin was observed in both stomach and jejunum of the null animals when compared with the controls. Cytoplasmic β-catenin was not significantly different between control and mutant animals. α-Tubulin served as loading control for the cytoplasmic extracts and the nuclear transcription factor YY1 served as the loading control for nuclear extracts. B, the levels of nuclear β-catenin in wild type and mutant mice were evaluated by comparing six mutant mice and six wild-type littermate controls. Western blots were performed and the results were scanned and quantified on ImageQuant software (IQMac v1.2). These results demonstrate statistically significant increases in nuclear β-catenin in the Foxl1 −/− mice of 2-fold in the stomach and a 2.3-fold increase in the jejunum (*,p < 0.01 and **, p < 0.002).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in epithelial cells of the gut by the mesenchymal transcription factor Foxl1 necessitates thatFoxl1 acts by an indirect mechanism. We have shown previously that, Foxl1 does not control the levels of the Wnt ligand itself, as mRNA levels of Wnt2 and Wnt5a are not altered in Foxl1 mutant mice (5Kaestner K.H. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway can be modified by levels of extracellular proteoglycans, which act as co-receptors to direct Wnt molecules to their high-affinity receptors, the frizzled proteins (10Tsuda M. Kamimura K. Nakato H. Archer M. Staatz W. Fox B. Humphrey M. Olson S. Futch T. Kaluza V. Siegfried E. Stam L. Selleck S.B.

Hinkes M.T. Lincecum J. Becker K.A. Cumberledge S. Bernfield M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We hypothesized thatFoxl1 could affect the levels of proteoglycans and thus impact on the interaction of the Wnt proteins with the frizzled receptor on the epithelial cell surface, thereby modulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway indirectly. We employed indirect immunofluorescence to immunolocalize and determine the levels of two proteoglycans, Syndecan-1 and Perlecan, which are expressed abundantly in the gut (12Alexander C.M. Reichsman F. Hinkes M.T. Lincecum J. Becker K.A. Cumberledge S. Bernfield M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26David G.

As shown in Fig.4, Syndecan-1 protein levels were dramatically increased in both stomach (Fig. 4 B) and jejunum (Fig. 4 D) of Foxl1 null mice compared with their control littermates (Fig. 4, A and C). Similar observations were made for Perlecan (data not shown). To confirm these findings with quantitative assays, we performed Western blot analysis for Syndecan-1 on total protein extracts of Foxl1 mutant mice and littermate controls (Fig.5 A). We found that Syndecan-1 was strongly increased in Foxl1 mutant mice supporting the observations made with the immunofluorescence. These results demonstrate that Foxl1 normally acts to limit the expression of Perlecan and Syndecan-1 in the gastrointestinal tract. To determine if the proteoglycans are direct transcriptional targets ofFoxl1, we analyzed their steady state mRNA levels by RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig. 5 B, there was no significant difference in the mRNA levels of Syndecan-1 between the mutant and the wild type mice in both stomach and jejunum. The same result was observed for Perlecan (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that Foxl1 regulates proteoglycans expression at the post-transcriptional level.Figure 5Quantitative analysis of Syndecan-1 protein level and mRNA expression in Foxl1 mice.Total protein extracts (50 μg) from stomach and jejunum of 120-day-old wild type control and Foxl1 mutant animals were analyzed for Syndecan-1 protein levels by immunoblotting (A). An increase of Syndecan-1 protein was observed in the stomach of the null animals when compared with littermate controls. α-Tubulin served as the loading control for the total protein extract. Total mRNA (20 μg) from stomach and jejunum of 120-day-old wild type control and Foxl1 mutant animals was analyzed for steady state levels of Syndecan-1 and TBP mRNA by RNase protection assay (B). No change was observed in the mRNA levels of Syndecan-1 in mutant animals compared with control mice. TATA box-binding protein (TBP) served as the loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Foxl1 mutant mice represent the first mammalian genetic model confirming embryological data on the importance of mesenchymal to epithelial signaling in the gastrointestinal tract. Subsequently, the mesenchymal transcription factor Nkx-2.3was also shown to affect epithelial differentiation in the gut (28Pabst O. Zweigerdt R. Arnold H.H. Development. 1999; 126: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, until now the molecular mechanism of Foxl1 action has remained elusive. In this study, we have established epithelial β-catenin as an indirect target for Foxl1. This activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the Foxl1 null mice occurs without an increase in Wnt expression. Rather, the efficacy of Wnt signaling is increased by a dramatic up-regulation of extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans which act as co-receptors for Wnt, funneling Wnt molecules to the signaling receptors, the frizzled proteins. Increased signaling through the frizzled receptors on the basolateral surface of the epithelial cells results in activation of the cytoplasmic protein disheveled, followed by inhibition β-catenin phosphorylation via glycogen synthetase-3β and accumulation of both cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin. It is the nuclear β-catenin that in a complex with the TCF/LEF DNA-binding proteins activates pro-proliferative target genes like cyclin D1 and c-myc, which ultimately results in the increased proliferation of gut epithelial cells observed in Foxl1 null mice. Previous genetics studies have demonstrated that HSPGs can play a crucial role in morphogenesis, growth regulation, and tumor suppression (13Selleck S.B. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 206-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It was first demonstrated in Drosophila that dysregulation of the proteoglycan Dally affectswingless signaling and the morphogenesis of numerous tissues (10Tsuda M. Kamimura K. Nakato H. Archer M. Staatz W. Fox B. Humphrey M. Olson S. Futch T. Kaluza V. Siegfried E. Stam L. Selleck S.B. Nature. 1999; 400: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In mammals, it was shown recently that a mutation in the HSPG Glypican-3 is responsible for a tumor-susceptibility syndrome (29Cano-Gauci D.F. Song H.H. Yang H. McKerlie C. Choo B. Shi W. Pullano R. Piscione T.D. Grisaru S. Soon S. Sedlackova L. Tanswell A.K. Mak T.W. Yeger H. Lockwood G.A. Rosenblum N.D. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), while Syndecan-1 is necessary for Wnt-1-dependent mammary tumorigenesis in mice (12Alexander C.M. Reichsman F. Hinkes M.T. Lincecum J. Becker K.A. Cumberledge S. Bernfield M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown for the first time evidence which implicates HSPGs in the control of proliferation of the gastrointestinal tract. It follows that HSPGs may also play a role in colorectal cancer in humans. Thus, it may be of clinical importance to investigate if patients with colorectal cancer show any alterations in the levels of Foxl1 or HSPGs. Future studies in our laboratory will be directed at establishing whether there is a genetic interaction between Foxl1 and the Wnt/APC/β-catenin pathway in gastrointestinal tumorigenesis. The results presented in this paper suggest that mutations in APC and Foxl1 should act synergistically, i.e. that the numbers of tumors will be increased or the onset of tumor formation will be accelerated in mice carrying mutations for both genes. Conversely, our findings predict that epithelial cell proliferation would be normalized in double mutants for both Foxl1 and Syndecan-1. Experiments aimed at verifying these predictions are currently in progress. In this study, we demonstrate that the activation of the Wntpathway in Foxl1 null mice is due to an increase in proteoglycan protein levels in the gut since Wnt expression itself is unchanged (5Kaestner K.H. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Schutz G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The increased Syndecan-1 and Perlecan expression in the Foxl1 mutant mice creates a microenvironment favorable to activation of the Wnt/APC/β-catenin pathway, which leads to an increase in epithelial proliferation. Thus we have established a novel link between mesenchymal and extracellular events and the control of the proliferation of epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract. At present, the molecular events that result in increased HSPG expression in Foxl1 null mice remain unknown, as the mRNA levels for both Syndecan-1 and Perlecan are unchanged in the absence of the Foxl1 transcription factor. We are currently investigating the possibility that the expression of matrix metalloproteinases or their inhibitors, the TIMP proteins (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) is controlled byFoxl1. We are grateful to Drs. D. G. Silberg and L. E. Greenbaum for critical reading of the manuscript."

We report the cloning and characterization of one of them that encodes the stress-induced proteins (SIP). The mouse SIP gene is organized into five exons and expands over ∼20 kilobase pairs. Exon 4 (38 base pairs) is alternatively spliced to generate two transcripts. Northern blot and in situ hybridization showed that both SIP mRNAs are rapidly and strongly induced in acinar cells of the pancreas with acute pancreatitis. They are also constitutively expressed in several other tissues, although with different ratios. They encode proteins of 18 and 27 kDa (SIP18 and SIP27). SIP27 is identical to the thymus-expressed acidic protein (TEAP) protein, formerly described as a thymus-specific protein. Expression of the SIP18 and SIP27/EGFP or V5 fusion proteins showed that both are nuclear factors. We monitored SIP expression in NIH3T3 cells submitted to various stress agents. UV stress, base damaging, mutagenic stress, ethanol, heat shock, and oxidative stress induced the concomitant expression of SIP18 and SIP27mRNAs. Finally, transient transfection of SIP18 and SIP27 expression plasmids induced death by apoptosis in COS7 cells as measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling staining. In conclusion, the SIPgene is an important element of cellular stress response. It is expressed in many tissues and induced by a variety of stress agents affecting many cellular pathways.

The disease spectrum ranges from mild edematous to severe necrotizing pancreatitis (1Wilson C. Imrie C.W. Drugs. 1991; 41: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because most attacks of acute pancreatitis are mild and self-limiting, it is highly probable that pancreatic cells can rapidly adapt their phenotype to this pathological situation to stop the progression of pancreatitis. Thus, identifying the genes involved in this response and understanding their function could lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for acute pancreatitis. In fact, we and others have previously reported that some genes are strongly activated in pancreatic acinar cells during the acute phase of pancreatitis. Most of these genes act to prevent disease evolution, whereas others participate in pancreatic regeneration that follows pancreatitis (reviewed in Ref. 2Dagorn J.C. Digestion. 1997; 58: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These results support the view that acute pancreatitis does not result in a mere repression of pancreatic function but induces a well defined response of the gland characterized by specific modulation of protein synthesis (3Iovanna J.L. Keim V. Michel R. Dagorn J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G485-G489PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, however, only a limited number of genes potentially implicated in the progression of this pathology have been identified.The cDNA microarray technology represents a new and powerful tool for the identification of genes that were not previously associated with the acute pancreatitis process. We used that approach to further characterize the pancreatic gene expression profile in response to acute pancreatitis (4Dusetti N.J. Tomasini R. Azizi A. Barthet M. Vaccaro M.I. Fiedler F. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the cloning of stress induced protein (SIP),1 a novel cellular stress-induced gene that generates, by alternative splicing, two nuclear proteins (SIP18 and SIP27) that can induce cell death.DISCUSSIONGene expression in pancreata with acute pancreatitis is strongly altered (reviewed in Ref. 2Dagorn J.C. Digestion. 1997; 58: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and these phenotypic changes could reflect a protection mechanism against pancreatitis progression. Most genes encoding secretory zymogens (whose availability is not a priority during aggression, some of them even being potentially hazardous to the cell (e.g. trypsinogen)) are repressed (3Iovanna J.L. Keim V. Michel R. Dagorn J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G485-G489PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, activated genes, often expressed to low level in normal conditions, should play a protective role (4Dusetti N.J. Tomasini R. Azizi A. Barthet M. Vaccaro M.I. Fiedler F. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Ortiz E.M. Dusetti N.J. Vasseur S. Malka D. Bodeker H. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 808-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying genes involved in this beneficial response and understanding their functions might lead to new therapeutic strategies for pancreatitis. A systematic approach based on DNA chips analysis allowed the identification of several up-regulated genes during pancreatitis. One of them, previously unreported and strongly overexpressed during pancreatitis, was chosen for further analysis. We named it the SIP gene. Kinetics of SIP mRNA expression during experimental pancreatitis showed that it was rapidly induced within 3 h, with a maximum at 9–12 h and eventual decrease to control values. SIP activity is therefore required during the early (acute) phase of pancreatitis rather than in the late phase of post-traumatic regeneration. Because the pancreas contains several cell types, we localized SIP expression by in situ hybridization and found it located to acinar cells only, demonstrating that SIP is involved in the acinar cell response. At that point, we decided to use RT-PCR probes for further studies, and to our surprise, we obtained two bands after amplification from pancreatic mRNA. After sequencing, it turned out that they differed by a 38-nucleotide stretch deleted in the short one. The coding sequences of the two transcripts were identical for the 145 N-terminal amino acids, and then the deletion induced a shift in the reading frame resulting in the coding of two proteins of 239- and 163-amino acids that we called SIP27 and SIP18according to their predicted molecular weight. To understand how the SIP gene could generate two mRNAs, we established its structural organization and could demonstrate that the 38-nucleotide deletion corresponded to exon 4 of the SIP gene. Thus, the two mRNAs are generated by alternative splicing. Because the SIP27 and SIP18 mRNAs are expressed to similar levels in the pancreas (Fig. 4), the corresponding proteins could be equally important in acinar cell physiopathology and had to be analyzed in parallel.We had selected SIP on the basis of its overexpression during acute pancreatitis. Although cells are obviously injured in the disease, the exact mechanism(s) involved at the cellular level are still debated. We examined the influence of various stress agents on SIP expression, taking advantage of the low constitutive SIP expression displayed by NIH3T3 cells. In these cells, all stress-inducing treatments tested (e.g. Adriamycin, oxidative stress, UV stress, or heat shock) resulted in SIPoverexpression. However, time courses were different, as expected from stress agents activating different pathways. Interestingly, SIP27 and SIP18 mRNAs were always coordinately activated. Therefore, SIP seems to be involved in all major stress pathways, suggesting that SIP27 and SIP18 play a central role in the cellular response to aggression.SIP function in cells was directly addressed by transfecting plasmids expressing SIP27 and SIP18 into COS7 cells. In transient transfections with plasmids expressing the proteins fused to fluorescent markers, SIP27 and SIP18 could be localized to the nucleus, as anticipated from their structural characteristics. However, in confocal observations of these cells 24 h or more after transfection, some nuclei showed abnormal morphology with peripheral chromatin localization suggesting apoptosis. Because most stress agents used in our NIH3T3 experiments can induce apoptosis, we tested whether SIP expression could promote cell death. Indeed, a colony formation test using COS7 cells with stable SIP transfection revealed that both SIP27and SIP18 expressions drastically decreased the number of colonies that the cells could produce. However, cell cycle arrest would have produced a similar result. Further analysis of morphological changes revealed that many cells showed characteristic features of apoptosis. Furthermore, that cell death occurred by apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL staining the transfected cells. Therefore, SIP27 and SIP18 do promote cell death, although concomitant influence on the cell cycle cannot be ruled out.Altogether, these results demonstrate that SIP is a stress-inducible gene. The two mRNA species generated by alternative splicing encode nuclear proteins that promote cell death.SIP overexpression during pancreatitis may be part of the defense mechanism allowing recovery after the acute attack. In fact, acinar cells are packed with enzymes that are potentially dangerous because their uncontrolled release would result in autodigestion. Therefore, acinar cells submitted to excessive stress may choose the apoptosis pathway to ensure their elimination by macrophages. Otherwise, cells would die by necrosis with concomitant release of cytolysis products that trigger inflammation, and the inflammatory cells would further increase local stress through cytokine release. This was supported by observations from Kaiser et al. (11Kaiser A.M. Saluja A.K. Sengupta A. Saluja M. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1295-C1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who observed a correlation between the intensity of necrosis and the severity of pancreatitis (the severe forms of pancreatitis being accompanied by little apoptosis), whereas apoptotic cells were frequent in mild, edematous pancreatitis. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis prior to acute pancreatitis diminished the severity of pancreatitis (12He Z.J. Podkletnova I. Alho H. Sand J. Nordback I. Ann. Chir.

We have observed various intensities of expression in several other tissues, and interestingly, different ratios of expression of SIP27and SIP18, suggesting that the two proteins have different functions and that alternative splicing is also subject to regulation. A search for homologies in data bases showed that SIP27 is identical to TEAP, which was selected by Carrier and collaborators (19Carrier A. Nguyen C. Victorero G. Granjeaud S. Rocha D. Bernard K. Miazek A. Ferrier P. Malissen M. Naquet P. Malissen B. Jordan B.R. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) upon quantitative differential screening as being specific of thymocytes in thymus. They also found SIP27/TEAP expressed, to a lesser extent, in other tissues. The function of SIP27/TEAP in thymus is unknown. It is noteworthy that we found both SIP18 and SIP27/TEAP expressed in thymus, the most abundant being SIP27/TEAP. Because the probe used by Carrier and collaborators (19Carrier A. Nguyen C. Victorero G. Granjeaud S. Rocha D. Bernard K. Miazek A. Ferrier P. Malissen M. Naquet P. Malissen B. Jordan B.R. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) could not distinguish between the two mRNAs and the presence of two very similar species was not expected, they reported SIP27/TEAP as being an important factor in thymocyte maturation. In light of the present results, that conclusion should be extended to SIP18, which might be equally or more important than SIP27/TEAP in thymocyte physiology. In fact SIP18 is a “short” TEAP, because their identical N terminus spans over 157 amino acids, including the PEST motif and regions involved in nuclear addressing. In addition, demonstration that SIP18 and SIP27/TEAP are stress-inducible and can promote apoptosis might be relevant to thymocyte maturation. Acute pancreatitis is the most frequent pancreatic affection. The disease spectrum ranges from mild edematous to severe necrotizing pancreatitis (1Wilson C. Imrie C.W. Drugs. 1991; 41: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because most attacks of acute pancreatitis are mild and self-limiting, it is highly probable that pancreatic cells can rapidly adapt their phenotype to this pathological situation to stop the progression of pancreatitis. Thus, identifying the genes involved in this response and understanding their function could lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for acute pancreatitis. In fact, we and others have previously reported that some genes are strongly activated in pancreatic acinar cells during the acute phase of pancreatitis. Most of these genes act to prevent disease evolution, whereas others participate in pancreatic regeneration that follows pancreatitis (reviewed in Ref. 2Dagorn J.C. Digestion. 1997; 58: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These results support the view that acute pancreatitis does not result in a mere repression of pancreatic function but induces a well defined response of the gland characterized by specific modulation of protein synthesis (3Iovanna J.L. Keim V. Michel R. Dagorn J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G485-G489PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, however, only a limited number of genes potentially implicated in the progression of this pathology have been identified. The cDNA microarray technology represents a new and powerful tool for the identification of genes that were not previously associated with the acute pancreatitis process. We used that approach to further characterize the pancreatic gene expression profile in response to acute pancreatitis (4Dusetti N.J. Tomasini R. Azizi A. Barthet M. Vaccaro M.I. Fiedler F. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the cloning of stress induced protein (SIP),1 a novel cellular stress-induced gene that generates, by alternative splicing, two nuclear proteins (SIP18 and SIP27) that can induce cell death. DISCUSSIONGene expression in pancreata with acute pancreatitis is strongly altered (reviewed in Ref. 2Dagorn J.C. Digestion. 1997; 58: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and these phenotypic changes could reflect a protection mechanism against pancreatitis progression. Most genes encoding secretory zymogens (whose availability is not a priority during aggression, some of them even being potentially hazardous to the cell (e.g. trypsinogen)) are repressed (3Iovanna J.L. Keim V. Michel R. Dagorn J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G485-G489PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, activated genes, often expressed to low level in normal conditions, should play a protective role (4Dusetti N.J. Tomasini R. Azizi A. Barthet M. Vaccaro M.I. Fiedler F. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Ortiz E.M. Dusetti N.J. Vasseur S. Malka D. Bodeker H. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 808-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying genes involved in this beneficial response and understanding their functions might lead to new therapeutic strategies for pancreatitis. A systematic approach based on DNA chips analysis allowed the identification of several up-regulated genes during pancreatitis. One of them, previously unreported and strongly overexpressed during pancreatitis, was chosen for further analysis. We named it the SIP gene. Kinetics of SIP mRNA expression during experimental pancreatitis showed that it was rapidly induced within 3 h, with a maximum at 9–12 h and eventual decrease to control values. SIP activity is therefore required during the early (acute) phase of pancreatitis rather than in the late phase of post-traumatic regeneration. Because the pancreas contains several cell types, we localized SIP expression by in situ hybridization and found it located to acinar cells only, demonstrating that SIP is involved in the acinar cell response. At that point, we decided to use RT-PCR probes for further studies, and to our surprise, we obtained two bands after amplification from pancreatic mRNA. After sequencing, it turned out that they differed by a 38-nucleotide stretch deleted in the short one.

The disease is clinically characterized by progressive dementia, spastic tetraparesis, and cerebellar ataxia with an age of onset in the fifth decade. Brain MRI scans of FBD patients show the existence of periventricular white matter hyperintensities resembling Binswanger's leukoencephalopathy (2Plant G. Révész T. Barnard R. Harding A.

Neuropathological examination of several FBD cases revealed a widespread severe amyloid angiopathy with perivascular deposits, amyloid plaques, and pre-amyloid lesions affecting the hippocampus and occasionally the cerebral cortex, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in hippocampal neurons (2Plant G.

Because of its clinical and neuropathological features, FBD has been previously interpreted as an atypical form of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) (8Aikawa H. Suzuki K. Iwasaki Y. Iizuka R. Ann. Neurol. 1985; 17: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as an example of spongiform encephalopathy (9Masters C.L. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs C.J.

Neurology. 1987; 37: 269-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also regarded as a specific form of primary congophilic angiopathy (12Vinters H.V. Stroke. 1987; 18: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar).We have recently reported that amyloid ABri, the main component of the parenchymal and vascular lesions in FBD, is a 4-kDa peptide derived from a type II transmembrane precursor molecule codified by a single multiexonic gene BRI2 (also known as ITM2B (13Pittois K. Deleersnijder W. Merregaert J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 217: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) located on the long arm of chromosome 13. A single substitution in the BRI2 gene (TGA to AGA at codon 267) results in an arginine replacing the normally occurring stop codon in the wild type precursor molecule and a longer open reading frame of 277 amino acids (ABriPP-277) (14Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Furin-like proteolytic processing releases the 34-amino acid ABri peptide from the C terminus of the mutated precursor protein (15Kim S.-H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosc. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Amyloid isolated from leptomeningeal fibrillar deposits shows a high degree of polymerization and a post-translationally modified N terminus (pyroglutamate) (14Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Synthetic ABri peptides are able to mimic in vitro the in vivo properties, namely the high tendency to polymerize and to form amyloid-like fibrils in physiologic conditions (16Ghiso J. Vidal R. Rostagno A. Miravalle L. Holton J.L. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Frangione B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The existence of circulating soluble precursors for both systemic and localized amyloid fibrils has been previously proposed (17Castaño E. Frangione B. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1995; 8: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as a putative source of most amyloidogenic proteins. In AD, amyloid deposits are composed of Aβ, a 39–43-residue internal proteolytic fragment derived from a larger precursor protein AβPP with a predicted structure of a multidomain, type I transmembrane cell-surface receptor codified by a single gene on chromosome 21 (reviewed in Ref. 18St. George-Hyslop P.H. Biol. Psychiatry. 2000; 47: 183-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Aβ species extracted from the tissue deposits are heterogeneous at the N and C terminus and exhibit a high tendency to form aggregates. A soluble form of Aβ (sAβ) has been identified in body fluids, cell conditioned media, and brain supernatants, consisting mainly of the first 40 residues of the amyloid peptide. It has been demonstrated in guinea pigs, mice, and rats that the blood-brain barrier has the capability to modulate sAβ transport in and out of the brain (19Zlokovic B. Martel C. Matsubara E.

Zlokovic B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Although the contribution of circulating sAβ to the deposited Aβ in AD brains is still debatable, the circulating peptide has been postulated to potentially contribute to the amyloid deposition (21Shibata M. Yamada S. Kumar S.R. Calero M. Bading J. Frangione B. Ghiso J. Zlokovic B. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). In the present report, we describe that in FBD-affected individuals, the de novo created ABri molecule is found not only in the circulation but as the main constituent of amyloid deposits in peripheral tissues. The ABri species identified in systemic deposits are indistinguishable from those isolated form the brain. However, the circulating soluble ABri differs from the deposited peptide in that it lacks the post-translationally modified N-terminal pyroglutamate.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA soluble form of ABri (sABri) in serum of patients with FBD was identified using a combination of immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation experiments with antibodies specific to the ten C-terminal residues of the ABri peptide (TVKKNIIEEN; Ab 338 (14Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar)) followed by Western blot and chemiluminescence identified a 4-kDa soluble component in all tested carriers of the Stop-to-Arg mutation (n = 8), and it was consistently absent in noncarrier family members (n= 12) and normal controls (n = 15) (Fig.1). In contrast to the brain-deposited ABri (14Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), sABri was consistently monomeric and devoid of N-terminal pyroglutamate with an observed average mass of 3953.5 ± 0.5 Da (expected: 3953.3 Da for the ABri peptide with oxidized cysteine residues). No obvious N- and/or C-terminal heterogeneity was observed. The experimental average mass was close to the theoretical mass value of the oxidized ABri peptide, suggesting that some of the soluble ABri molecules may contain a single intrachain disulfide bond. Consistent with these data is the mass spectrometry analysis of synthetic full-length ABri peptides either containing or lacking a single disulfide bond between cysteine residues 5 and 22. The observed average mass for the oxidized synthetic ABri was 3953.4 Da versus3955.2 Da for the reduced peptide (see “Materials and Methods”). A molecular mass of 3935.5 Da was previously reported for a secreted ABri species detected in conditioned medium of N2a cells transfected with full-length ABriPP-277 cDNA containing the Stop-to-Arg mutation, a mass value also consistent with the presence of N-terminal glutamate and suggestive of oxidized cysteines (15Kim S.-H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosc. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).The origin of the circulating soluble ABri is not clearly established yet; however, based on Northern blot analysis (14Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) it can be speculated that the brain, kidney, and pancreas might be the most likely sources. The plasma levels in the small number of FBD carriers available (n = 8) was estimated in the range of 20 ng/ml by means of scanning densitometry of the immunoprecipitated bands. The existence of such elevated plasma levels of sABri may imply that, in FBD patients, amyloid deposits could also occur outside the central nervous system. Using conventional immunohistochemical methods, we searched for ABri deposits in systemic organs obtained at autopsy from two FBD cases. As previously demonstrated for cerebral amyloid and pre-amyloid lesions (6Holton J. Ghiso J. Lashley T. Rostagno A. Guerin C.J. Gibb G. Houlden H. Ayling H. Martinian L. Anderton R.H. Wood N.W.

Parenchymal deposits either CR-negative/TS-negative or CR-positive/TS-positive were also seen in organs such as pancreas (Fig.2), adrenal gland, myocardium, and skeletal muscle (not shown). Western blot analysis and mass spectrometry data of the amyloid material extracted from either vascular or parenchymal lesions of two peripheral organs (pancreas and heart) revealed ABri species identical to those found in the brain lesions. As illustrated in Fig.3 for the parenchymal deposits in pancreas, the pattern of ABri immunoreactivity (ABri monomers, dimers, trimers, and larger oligomeric species) was comparable with that of the amyloid isolated from the brain. N-terminal sequence analysis of the 4- and 8-kDa components rendered similar results, two minor sequences SN XFAIRHF (corresponding to positions 3–11 of ABri) and EASNXFAIX (corresponding to residues 1–8 of ABri) that represented less than 20% of the protein loaded, suggesting a blocked N terminus for the main deposited component, as previously reported for the leptomeningeal ABri amyloid (14Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J.

The experimental mass obtained, 3935.7 Da, was also close to the theoretical mass of the oxidized peptide and differed in 18 units from the ABri species found in circulation (average mass 3953.5 Da), a value accountable for the loss of one molecule of water and the formation of pyroglutamate. Two minor components were also identified: (a) a full-length ABri peptide containing glutamic acid at the N terminus, identical to sABri (observed average mass 3953.5 ± 0.4 Da; expected 3953.3 Da) and (b) an N-terminal truncated ABri fragment starting at serine 3 (observed average mass 3753.4 ± 0.3 Da; expected 3,753.3 Da), a product previously identified in cerebrovascular deposits. Collectively, the last two components accounted for less than 20% of the systemic amyloid deposits and less than 10% of the brain lesions, results consistent with the amino acid sequence data. As also indicated in Fig. 4, formylated species of all the above mentioned peptides, probably by-products of the extraction procedure, were present in the samples. Almost identical results were obtained with the microvessels extracts (data not shown). When compared in terms of electrophoretic mobility, pattern of polymerization, immunoreactivity, and molecular mass, the ABri amyloid subunits deposited in the brain were chemically indistinguishable from that in the systemic organs studied, indicating that in both cases, amyloid formation most likely occurs by a similar (if not identical) biochemical mechanism.Figure 4Mass spectrometry analysis of amyloid fractions. Amyloid extracted from the pancreas (top) and the cerebral gray matter (bottom) was subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Notation: 1, peaks with an average mass of 3936.8 Da (brain) and 3936.7 Da (pancreas) correspond to the ABri molecule bearing pyroglutamate at the N terminus;2, peaks with an average mass of 3954.6 Da (brain) and 3954.5 Da (pancreas) represent ABri species containing glutamate at the N terminus; 3, peaks with an average mass of 3754.2 Da (brain) and 3754.4 Da (pancreas) correspond to ABri species starting at serine 3; *, indicates Abri-formylated species (average mass change of +28).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The neuropathology of FBD is strikingly similar to that of AD,i.e. both exhibit vascular amyloid and parenchymal amyloid and pre-amyloid deposition and NFTs (22Dickson D. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In AD, parenchymal Aβ deposits are mainly present in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex, while Aβ vascular lesions are predominantly seen in leptomeningeal and cortical vessels. Degenerating neurons containing NFTs are frequent in limbic areas and in the neocortex. Paired helical filament-containing abnormal neurites, frequently co-localize with amyloid deposits (neuritic plaques). In FBD, however, severe amyloid angiopathy with perivascular plaque formation occurs throughout the central nervous system. Parenchymal amyloid plaques and pre-amyloid deposits together with neurofibrillary pathology predominantly affect limbic structures but rarely the cerebral cortex, clearly indicating that amyloid deposition is of primary importance in the initiation of neurodegeneration. The distribution of NFTs in FBD corresponds to stage IV in the system recommended by Braak and Braak for AD (23Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11323) Google Scholar). Similar to AD, the NFTs in FBD are ultrastructurally composed of paired helical filaments; moreover, the electrophoretic pattern of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau isolated from FBD brain tissue is indistinguishable from that seen in AD (6Holton J. Ghiso J. Lashley T. Rostagno A. Guerin C.J. Gibb G. Houlden H. Ayling H. Martinian L. Anderton R.H. Wood N.W. Vidal R. Plant G. Frangione B. Revesz T. Am. J.

Acta Neuropathol. 1999; 97: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The presence of the soluble amyloid peptide sABri in plasma adds another element to the striking pattern of similarities between FBD and AD, although the plasma levels of sABri surpasses by at least 10-fold those of sAβ. Despite this similitude, the ABri amyloid subunit forming the lesions in FBD is completely unrelated in sequence to the Aβ molecule composing the fibrillar deposits in AD.The N-terminal amino acid of many proteins, hormones, and neurotrasmitters is pyroglutamic acid. The pyroglutamyl moiety results from the post-translational modification of either glutamine or glutamic acid. Cyclization of glutamine to pyroglutamic acid involves the nucleophilic attack of the α-amino group on the amidated carboxyl group, and the reaction is catalyzed at neutral pH by an enzyme known as glutamine cyclotransferase (24Messer M. Ottensen M. C. R. Trav. Lab. Carlsberg. 1965; 35: 1-29PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gololobov M.Y. Song L. Wang W. Baterman R.C. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1987; 262: 8532-8536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Less is known about the cyclization of glutamic acid in which the chemical reaction involves the loss of one molecule of water, although an apparently specific enzymatic activity has been recently detected in Aplysianeurons (27Garden R.W. Moroz T.P. Gleeson J.M. Floyd P.D. Li L. Rubakhin S.S. Sweedler J.V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Analysis of the genes codifying the many molecules containing this post-translational modification indicate that glutamine and not glutamate is the common precursor of the N-terminal pyroglutamic acid. However, few exceptions have been reported, among them processing products of pro-opiomelanocortin (28Baterman A. Solomon S. Bennett H.P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22130-22136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fragments of Alzheimer's Aβ peptide (29Mori H. Takio K. Ogawara M. Selkoe D. J. Biol.

Neurol. 1998; 57: 76-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the later case, the use of mass spectrometry and specific antibodies have allowed the identification in the brains of AD patients of deposited modified Aβ species AβpE3 and AβpE11 starting at residues 3 and 11 and containing N-terminal pyroglutamate. In both instances the original amino acid is glutamic acid, as it is the case of the ABri amyloid as well as in the recently described ADan peptide, the main component of cerebral amyloid deposits in familial Danish dementia (32Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A. Kim E. Holton J. Bek T. Bojsen-Møller M. Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The mechanism that produce these N-terminal blocked peptides is not entirely clear. In the case of ABri, it is released from its precursor ABriPP-277 by a furin-like proteolytic processing that occurs in the Golgi apparatus. Using N2a cells transfected with ABriPP-277, the release of full-length ABri to the conditioned media was demonstrated (15Kim S.-H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosc. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The peptide contained glutamate but not pyroglutamate at the N terminus, and it was identical in mass to the circulating sABri described above. Therefore, one likely possibility is that the chemically irreversible conversion from glutamate to pyroglutamate in FBD takes place at the site of deposition; alternatively, the rate of amyloid formation and deposition may preferentially favor the pyroglutamate-containing peptide. The finding that the same ABri species are found in the brain and systemic organ amyloid deposits suggests that the pyroglutamate-forming mechanism is not neuron-specific. It is interesting to note that Aβ and ABri may also share a similar mechanism for the release of the two N-terminal residues that generate Aβ3–40/42 and ABri 3–34. Both molecules contain an acidic N-terminal amino acid followed by alanine (Asp-Ala-↓ in Aβ and Glu-Ala-↓ in ABri), a likely substrate for dipeptidyl aminopeptidases II and IV (33McDonald J.K. Barret A. Rawlings N. Woessner J. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 408-411Google Scholar, 34Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Barret A. Rawlings N. Woessner J. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, London1998: 378-382Google Scholar).The presence of Congo red/thioflavin S-positive ABri amyloid deposits in systemic organs in individuals with FBD contrasts with the findings of Congo red-negative Aβ immunoreactivity in non-central nervous system tissues deposits in AD patients (35Joachim C. Mori H. Selkoe D. Nature. 1989; 341: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 36Skodras G. Peng J. Parker J. Kragel P. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1993; 23: 275-280PubMed Google Scholar, 37Wen G.

Several elements may converge to produce systemic ABri amyloid deposits in patients with FBD: (i) high levels of the putative circulating precursor, increasing the probability of monomer-monomer interactions resulting in polymerization; (ii) the presence of N-terminal pyroglutamate, which facilitates aggregation and increases the resistance to proteolytic degradation by amino peptidases; (iii) the unlikelihood that specific cellular receptors participate in the physiologic clearance of the deposits, since sABri/ABri are de novo created molecules.Amyloid deposits simultaneously present in the brain and in systemic organs have been previously found in another autosomal dominant disorder, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Icelandic type (HCHWA-I). This disease, characterized by massive amyloid deposition of mutant cystatin C Q68 (38Ghiso J. Jensson O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2974-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) within small arteries and arterioles of leptomeninges, cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum (39Gudmundsson G. Hallgrimsson J. Jonasson T. Bjarnason O. Brain. 1972; 95: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), also presents with silent amyloid deposits in peripheral tissues such as skin, lymph nodes, spleen, salivary glands, and seminal vesicles (40Benedikz E. Blondal H. Gudmunsson G. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histol. 1990; 417: 325-331Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities the main clinical hallmark of the disease is cerebral hemorrhage, not dementia, with fatal outcome in the third to fourth decade of life. The results reported here (summarized in Fig. 5) indicate that FBD is the first documented cerebral amyloidosis associated with extensive neurofibrillar degeneration in which significant amyloid deposits are also found in peripheral organs. The extent to which the systemic amyloid precursor peptide contributes to the mechanism of cerebral amyloid formation remains an open question. The corroboration of an active role of circulating sABri in amyloid deposition in the brain and elsewhere will undoubtedly change the therapeutic approaches proposed for inhibiting amyloidogenesis in the human brain.Figure 5Schematic summary of the deposited ABri species identified in the brain and pancreas in comparison with solubl"
https://openalex.org/W2093379023,"Progelatinase A (proGLA) activation is thought to be initiated almost exclusively by the type I transmembrane members of the membrane type matrix metalloproteinase family (MT-MMP): MT1, -2, -3, and -5-MMP (MMP14, -15, -16, and -24). One difference between these enzymes and the other MMP family members is the insertion of eight amino acids between strands βII and III in the catalytic domain. In MT1-MMP, the best characterized of these enzymes to date, these residues consist of163PYAYIREG170. To investigate the role of this region of MT1-MMP on its catalytic activities, we have made a variety of mutations and deletions in both soluble and membrane-bound forms of the enzyme. Characterization of the activity of the soluble forms toward peptides and fibrinogen revealed that neither mutation nor deletion of residues 163–170 significantly impaired catalytic function, suggesting these residues have little influence on conformation of the active site cleft. Equally none of the mutants showed significant differences in KIapp for the N-terminal inhibitory domain of TIMP2, again indicating that mutation or deletion of resides 163–170 has no major effect on the overall topology of the active site of MT1-MMP. However, characterization of the kinetics of activation of proGLA with and without its gelatin binding region by the mutants generated have shown that efficient activation of proGLA is, at least in part, through an interaction with residues 163–170 of MT1-MMP. The expression, localization, and processing from the 63- to the 60/45-kDa forms of wild-type and key mutant forms of MT1-MMP were also examined by transient transfection in Chinese hamster ovary cells, but no differences were observed. Processing and activation of proGLA was also examined in transiently transfected cells. All the mutants examined were able process proGLA but, as found with the soluble forms, were kinetically impaired when compared with wild-type MT1-MMP."
https://openalex.org/W2082875344,"Neurotransmitter transporters regulate synaptic transmitter levels and are themselves functionally regulated by a number of different signal transduction cascades. A common theme in transporter regulation is redistribution of transporter protein between intracellular stores and the plasma membrane. The triggers and mechanisms underlying this regulation are important in the control of extracellular transmitter concentrations and hence synaptic signaling. Previously, we demonstrated that the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT1 is regulated by direct tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in an up-regulation of transporter expression on the plasma membrane. In the present report, we show that two tyrosine residues on GAT1 contribute to the phosphorylation and transporter redistribution. Tyrosine phosphorylation is concomitant with a decrease in the rate of transporter internalization from the plasma membrane. A decrease in GAT internalization rates also occurs in the presence of GAT1 substrates, suggesting the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for the substrate-induced up-regulation of GAT1 surface expression. In support of this hypothesis, incubation of GAT1-expressing cells with transporter ligands alters the amount of GAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and substrate-induced surface expression is unchanged in a GAT1 mutant lacking tyrosine phosphorylation sites. These data suggest a model in which substrates permit the phosphorylation of GAT1 on tyrosine residues and that the phosphorylated state of the transporter is refractory for internalization. Neurotransmitter transporters regulate synaptic transmitter levels and are themselves functionally regulated by a number of different signal transduction cascades. A common theme in transporter regulation is redistribution of transporter protein between intracellular stores and the plasma membrane. The triggers and mechanisms underlying this regulation are important in the control of extracellular transmitter concentrations and hence synaptic signaling. Previously, we demonstrated that the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT1 is regulated by direct tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in an up-regulation of transporter expression on the plasma membrane. In the present report, we show that two tyrosine residues on GAT1 contribute to the phosphorylation and transporter redistribution. Tyrosine phosphorylation is concomitant with a decrease in the rate of transporter internalization from the plasma membrane. A decrease in GAT internalization rates also occurs in the presence of GAT1 substrates, suggesting the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation is required for the substrate-induced up-regulation of GAT1 surface expression. In support of this hypothesis, incubation of GAT1-expressing cells with transporter ligands alters the amount of GAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and substrate-induced surface expression is unchanged in a GAT1 mutant lacking tyrosine phosphorylation sites. These data suggest a model in which substrates permit the phosphorylation of GAT1 on tyrosine residues and that the phosphorylated state of the transporter is refractory for internalization. γ-aminobutyric acid Chinese hamster ovary HEPES-buffered saline solution 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid dopamine transporter γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)1 is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The inhibitory action of GABA, mediated through both GABAA and GABAB receptors, is regulated by GABA transporters (1Isaacson J.S. Solis J.M. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1993; 10: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 2Dingledine R. Korn S.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1985; 366: 387-409Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 3Solis J.M. Nicoll R.A. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3466-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), integral membrane proteins located perisynaptically on neurons and glia (4Ribak C.E. Tong W.M.Y. Brecha N.C. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 367: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). GABA transporters also play a pathophysiological role in temporal lobe epilepsy (5During M.J. Ryder K.M. Spencer D.D. Nature. 1995; 376: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and are the targets of pharmacological interventions in epilepsy treatment (6Thomsen C. Suzdak P.D. Epilepsy Res. 1995; 21: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that GABA transporters, and neurotransmitter transporters in general, are not passive players in regulating neuronal signaling; rather, transporter function can be altered by a variety of initiating factors and signal transduction cascades (for review see Refs. 7Gegelashvili G. Schousboe A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar and 8Beckman M.L. Quick M.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In general, this functional regulation occurs in two ways, by changing the rate of transmitter flux through the transporter (9Deken S. Beckman M. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or by changing the number of functional transporters on the plasma membrane. A recurring theme in transporter regulation is the rapid redistribution of the transporter protein between intracellular locations and the cell surface. This functional modulation occurs in part through activation of second messengers such as kinases, phosphatases, arachidonic acid, and pH. These factors may act directly on the transporter protein (e.g. by phosphorylation; see Refs. 10Casado M. Bendahan A. Zafra F. Danbolt N.C. Aragón C. Giménez C. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27313-27317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Conradt M. Stoffel W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1244-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 12Ramamoorthy S.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying transporter phosphorylation and transporter redistribution have yet to be fully elucidated. Also unknown is whether such second messenger-correlated effects alter rates of transporter internalization, externalization, or both. Previously, we showed that inhibitors of tyrosine kinases decreased GABA uptake in hippocampal neurons that endogenously express GAT1. The decrease in uptake seen with tyrosine kinase inhibitors was correlated with a decrease in direct tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 and resulted in a redistribution of the transporter from the cell surface to intracellular locations (14Law R. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present report, we show that two tyrosine residues on GAT1 are responsible for both the phosphorylation of GAT1 and for its subcellular distribution. The increase in surface GAT1 expression that correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation is because of a decrease in the internalization rate of the transporter. Furthermore, substrate-induced up-regulation of GAT1 expression (15Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 889-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) requires direct tyrosine phosphorylation. These data suggest a model in which GAT1 substrates permit the phosphorylation of the transporter on tyrosine residues and that the phosphorylated state of the transporter limits transporter internalization. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Optimem I (Life Technologies, Inc.). The lipid/DNA mix was incubated with the cells for 5 h; cells were then rinsed and fed with complete medium. GAT1 tyrosine residue mutants were made using Altered Sites I (Promega). Five putative intracellular tyrosine residues (Tyr-107, Tyr-317, Tyr-412, Tyr-481, and Tyr-598; see Ref. 16Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) were mutated to alanine individually or together. The mutants were subcloned into pcDNA3 for subsequent transfections. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Pre-assay drug incubations (5–15 min) were performed in HBSS. Following incubation, cells were rinsed three times in 1× HBSS and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min in the final wash. Buffer was then exchanged with control HBSS or drug-containing HBSS. GABA was added to initiate the assay. The final [3H]GABA concentration of the assay solution was 40 nm; the total GABA concentration of the assay solution was 30 μm. The assay was terminated by rapidly rinsing the cells 3 times with 1× HBSS, followed by solubilization in 300 μl of 0.001–0.005% SDS at 37 °C for 2 h. Aliquots were used for scintillation counting and to determine protein concentrations. Statistical analyses of the uptake data were performed using SPSS. Two-sample comparisons were made using t tests; multiple comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variances followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference post-hoc test. Biotinylation experiments were performed essentially as described (17Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes to 80% confluence. The cells were rinsed twice with 37 °C phosphate-buffered saline/Ca2+/Mg2+ (in mm: 138 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1.5 KH2PO4, 9.6 Na2HPO4, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were next incubated with 2 ml of a solution containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS biotin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline/Ca2+/Mg2+ for 20 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The biotinylation solution was removed by two washes in phosphate-buffered saline/Ca/Mg plus 100 mm glycine and quenched in this solution by incubating the cells at 4 °C for 45 min with gentle shaking. The cells were lysed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (in mm: 100 Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 250 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 60 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant fractions (300 μl) were incubated with an equal volume of Immunopure immobilized monomeric avidin beads (Pierce) for 60 min. The beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and adsorbed proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm μ-mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for 30 min. For the internalization experiments, cells were labeled with biotinylating reagent at 4 °C, brought up to 22 °C for different time periods, and then placed immediately on ice. Removal of already surface-bound NHS-SS-biotin was performed using Mes-Na+ as described (19Jankowski M. Biber J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 689-693PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dishes were washed with buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris) and then incubated for 10 min with buffer, for 30 min with buffer containing freshly dissolved 10 mm Mes-Na+, and twice for 60 min with buffer with Mes-Na+. Control dishes were treated identically, except the Mes-Na+ was omitted. The dishes were then thoroughly rinsed three times with buffer to remove Mes-Na+. Following treatment with the appropriate drug, cells were lysed in buffer (9.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 1.7 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 250 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.0 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 5.0 mm sodium pyrophosphate) for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were precleared with 10 μl of protein G-agarose conjugate (Sigma), followed by immunoprecipitation of GAT1 using anti-GAT1 antibody 346J (20Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein G-agarose. The product was washed in radioimmune precipitation buffer and run on a 10% acrylamide gel. Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. Western blotting was performed using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized using ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Previously we showed that GAT1, endogenously expressed in hippocampal neurons and heterologously expressed in CHO cells, was a substrate for tyrosine-mediated phosphorylation, and that a GAT1 mutant lacking all five putative intracellular tyrosine residues was refractory for tyrosine phosphorylation (14Law R. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine the site or sites of tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1, we made additional GAT1 mutants that contained only one of five intracellular tyrosine residues; the other four putative intracellular tyrosine residues in each construct were changed to alanine residues. These mutant transporters were expressed in CHO cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and subsequent immunoblotting with an anti-GAT1 antibody. These results are shown in the upper immunoblot of Fig. 1. Wild-type GAT1 and constructs containing tyrosine residues only at amino acid positions 107 or 317 (16Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kanner B.I. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) showed immunoreactive bands of the appropriate size; constructs containing individual tyrosine residues at amino acid positions 412, 481, and 598 and the GAT1 mutant lacking all five putative intracellular tyrosine residues (5YA) did not show immunoreactive bands. These results suggest that two tyrosine residues in GAT1, Tyr-107 in the putative first intracellular loop and Tyr-317 in the putative third intracellular loop, can be phosphorylatedin vivo. To determine whether the amount of phosphorylation of these residues could be modulated, similar experiments were repeated in the presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. These results are shown in the lower immunoblot of Fig. 1. Both the Tyr-107 construct and the Tyr-317 construct showed reduced levels of phosphorylation in the presence of genistein. In GAT1 expressed endogenously in hippocampal neurons, decreases in tyrosine phosphorylation correlate with the following two events: (i) an approximate 50% decrease in GABA uptake and (ii) a decrease in the amount of GAT1 protein on the plasma membrane, accompanied by a concomitant increase of GAT1 protein in intracellular locations (14Law R. Stafford A. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23986-23991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine which of the two tyrosine phosphorylation sites may be associated with these functional and trafficking effects, we examined GABA uptake and GAT1 subcellular distribution of the Tyr-107 and Tyr-317 mutants. These results are shown in Fig.2. Genistein pretreatment of CHO cells expressing either the Tyr-107 phosphorylation site or the Tyr-317 phosphorylation site alone resulted in an approximate 25–35% reduction in radiolabeled GABA uptake, compared with ∼55% in wild-type GAT1-expressing cells (Fig. 2 A). None of the other GAT1 constructs containing individual tyrosine residues, nor the GAT1 mutant lacking all putative intracellular tyrosine residues, showed reduced uptake. These data suggest that either tyrosine phosphorylation site is sufficient to mediate the genistein inhibition of GABA uptake. To determine whether the decrease in function mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with a decrease in surface expression of GAT1, we performed surface biotinylation experiments on wild-type GAT1 and various GAT1 tyrosine mutants. Representative immunoblots are shown in Fig. 2 B, and their quantitation is shown in Fig.2 C. In wild-type GAT1 expressed in CHO cells, approximately half of the GAT1 protein, in the untreated state, was found on the plasma membrane. Treatment with genistein reduced the amount of GAT1 found on the plasma membrane by half, which correlated well with the 50% reduction of GABA uptake seen in these cells following genistein treatment. The loss in plasma membrane expression of GAT1 also correlated well with an accumulation of GAT1 intracellularly. CHO cells expressing GAT1 mutants containing only the Tyr-107 phosphorylation site or the Tyr-317 phosphorylation site showed basal expression and genistein-mediated redistribution that was comparable with wild-type GAT1; that is, in either phosphorylation site mutant ∼50% of the transporter was found on the plasma membrane in the basal state, and this amount was reduced in the presence of genistein. In a GAT1 mutant in which both tyrosine phosphorylation sites were changed to alanine residues (T107A,T317A), the majority of GAT1 was found intracellularly, and the subcellular distribution of the transporter was not regulated by genistein. The amount of surface GAT1 for the Tyr-107 and the Tyr-317 mutants in the presence of genistein was similar to the amount of surface GAT1 present in the constructs lacking these two phosphorylation sites (T107A,T317A or 5YA). These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 at either phosphorylation site is responsible for both the basal expression level of the transporter on the plasma membrane and the genistein-mediated reduction in surface transporter expression. The above data showing a net accumulation of GAT intracellularly because of a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation (either by genistein or by removal of tyrosine phosphorylation sites) suggested that a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with an increase in the internalization rate of GAT1. To test this hypothesis, we used an approach based upon surface biotinylation (19Jankowski M. Biber J. Murer H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 689-693PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, surface GAT1 was labeled with biotin at cold temperatures. The temperature was then raised to 22 °C, permitting the internalization of the transporter. After specified time periods, the cells were chilled again, and the biotin that remained attached to surface GAT1 was stripped away by reducing agents (thus the only remaining biotin was that which was protected by internalization). The amount of intracellular GAT1 at each time point could then be compared with initial surface levels of GAT1 to determine the internalization rate. These results are shown in Fig.3. In wild-type GAT1-expressing cells, internalized transporter could be detected within 1 min, and this amount gradually increased with longer internalization times (Fig. 3 A). The same was true for wild-type GAT1-expressing cells treated with genistein and for the GAT1 mutant lacking all putative intracellular tyrosine residues; however, in the latter two cases, the amount of internalized transporter was greater at all time points measured. In a set of control experiments, wild-type GAT1-expressing cells were labeled with biotin and then immediately stripped; no bands were seen in subsequent immunoblots (data not shown), suggesting that all of the immunoreactivity seen in these experiments came from internalized transporter. The rates of internalization (Fig. 3 B) were quantified by comparing the immunoreactivity at each time point with the initial surface levels of GAT1 (denoted as S in Fig. 3 A). These calculations showed that untreated wild-type GAT1 internalized at ∼10% per min at 22 °C; both genistein-treated wild-type GAT1 and tyrosine phosphorylation-deficient GAT1 mutants internalized approximately twice as fast. Although we do not yet know whether there are also changes in the rates of GAT1 externalization, the alterations in transporter internalization are sufficient to account for the 50% decrease in both GABA uptake and surface transporter protein in tyrosine phosphorylation-deficient transporters. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with increases in surface GAT1 protein levels and GABA uptake, and this is consistent with decreases in transporter internalization rates. Previously, we showed that substrates of GAT1 such as GABA and the transporter-specific substrate nipecotic acid also increase surface GAT1 protein levels and GABA uptake (15Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 889-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These data suggested that this effect of substrates may occur by similarly decreasing transporter internalization rates. To test this hypothesis, wild-type GAT1-expressing cells were treated with nipecotic acid and examined for changes in function and trafficking. These data are shown in Fig. 4. Treatment for 10 min with nipecotic acid resulted in a significant increase in radiolabeled GABA uptake; this increase was blocked by co-application of the GABA transporter-specific antagonist SKF89976A (Fig.4 A). Changes in transporter internalization rates in the presence of nipecotic acid were performed as described in Fig. 3. Nipecotic acid treatment decreased the internalization of GAT1 compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4 B). Quantification of the internalization rate showed that the decrease in internalization rates was ∼50%, consistent with the approximate 2-fold increase in GABA uptake following nipecotic acid treatment. The data from Figs. 3 and 4 revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation and substrate incubation resulted in a similar phenotype, namely increased function, increased surface transporter expression, and decreased internalization rates. This raised the possibility that these two modulatory events share a common mechanism. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that GAT1 ligands regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1. These results are shown in Fig. 5. Cells expressing wild-type GAT1 were untreated or treated with nipecotic acid or SKF89976A, subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and immunoblotting with an anti-GAT1 antibody. Nipecotic acid treatment increased the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 (Fig. 5 A, upper blot) whereas SKF89976A caused a decrease in the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 (Fig. 5 A, lower blot). As a control, the GAT1 mutant lacking all putative intracellular tyrosine residues did not show immunoreactive bands, either in the untreated state or in the nipecotic acid-pretreated state (Fig. 5 A,upper blot). Quantitation of the immunoblots of wild-type GAT1 phosphorylation in the presence of GAT1 ligands is shown in Fig.5 B. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 in the presence of GABA transporter substrates and the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 in the presence of GABA transporter antagonists suggested that ligand-induced regulation of GAT1 function and surface expression may be mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we examined ligand-induced regulation of wild-type GAT1 and GAT1 mutants that cannot be tyrosine-phosphorylated. These results are shown in Fig. 6. Cells expressing wild-type GAT1 or GAT1 5YA were treated with nipecotic acid and subjected to surface biotinylation (Fig. 6 A). Whereas the amount of surface expression of wild-type GAT1 increased in the presence of nipecotic acid, no increase in surface expression was detected in the GAT1 5YA mutant. In addition, the nipecotic acid-mediated increase in surface expression of wild-type GAT1 was blocked by co-application of genistein (Fig. 6 B, upper blot), and the decrease in surface expression of GAT1 in the presence of SKF89976A was not further affected by co-application of genistein. Quantification of these results (Fig. 6 C) showed that prevention of tyrosine phosphorylation (either by genistein or by removal of tyrosine phosphorylation sites) eliminated the substrate-induced up-regulation of GAT1 surface expression. Furthermore, the presence of transporter antagonists (SKF89976A) reduced surface GAT1 expression, and this reduction was concomitant with a decrease in antagonist-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation (see Fig. 5). These data suggest that GABA transporter ligands mediate their trafficking effects on GAT1 via tyrosine phosphorylation. Neurotransmitter transporters exhibit a number of functional properties that enable them to influence extracellular neurotransmitter levels. For example, transport rates are dependent on substrate concentrations, with half-maximal effective concentrations for transport occurring in the submicromolar to low micromolar range (21Iversen L.L. Iversen L.L. Iversen S.D. Snyder S.H. Handbook of Psychopharmacology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1975: 381-442Google Scholar,22Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Transporter function is bidirectional, and non-vesicular efflux of transmitter may contribute to ambient extracellular transmitter levels. Transmitter efflux may be related to pathophysiological conditions (5During M.J. Ryder K.M. Spencer D.D. Nature. 1995; 376: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar,23Attwell D. Barbour B. Szatkowski M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 24Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hebert S.C. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), but it can also be a primary mechanism of transmitter release (25Schwartz E.A. Science. 1987; 238: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 26Gaspary H.L. Wang W. Richerson G.B. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Neurotransmitter transporter expression can also be regulated, and changes in the number of functional transporters will contribute to the control of synaptic neurotransmitter levels either through transport directly (27Mennerick S. Shen W. Xu W. Benz A. Tanaka K. Shimamoto K. Isenberg K.E. Krause J.E. Zorumski C.F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9242-9251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by changing the number of synaptic binding sites for released transmitter (28Diamond J.S. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4672-4687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One trigger for alterations in surface transporter expression is feedback from extracellular transmitter. The serotonin transporter is differentially regulated by psychostimulants that act as either serotonin transporter antagonists or substrates (29Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Norepinephrine transporters are down-regulated following chronic treatment with the norepinephrine transporters antagonist desipramine, perhaps through changes in protein expression and/or transporter turnover (30Zhu M.Y. Blakely R.D. Apparsundaram S. Ordway G.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1547-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast to serotonin transporter, the norepinephrine transporters agonists norepinephrine and amphetamine also cause decreases in expression (31Zhu M.Y. Shamburger S. Li J. Ordway G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 951-959PubMed Google Scholar). In dopamine transporters (DATs), DAT agonists dopamine and amphetamine cause a net accumulation of intracellular DAT; this internalization is blocked by the DAT antagonist cocaine (32Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6850-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). GABA and other GABA transporter substrates and antagonists interact with the GABA transporter GAT1 to directly regulate transmitter uptake by up-regulating or down-regulating surface transporter expression, respectively (15Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 889-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the present report, we show that GABA transporter ligands alter tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 and that this event is required for ligand-induced changes in surface GAT1 expression. Increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of either of two tyrosine residues in GAT1 results in a decrease in the rate of GAT1 internalization from the plasma membrane, effectively increasing the functional expression of GAT1. It is hypothesized that direct phosphorylation of the serotonin transporter by protein kinase C serves as a tag that identifies transporters to be internalized (12Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This might occur, because the tag is indicative of a transporter in an appropriate conformational state for internalization. The evidence that serotonin transporter substrates prevent protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation and increase surface transporter expression supports a role for conformational changes in the transporter as being important for redistribution (29Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We suggest a similar model for GAT1; substrates produce a conformational change in the transporter protein that increases the likelihood that the transporter will become tyrosine-phosphorylated. Tyrosine phosphorylation is then the molecular switch for preventing internalization. Tyrosine kinase activity has been shown to regulate redistribution of receptors (33Wan Q. Xiong Z.G. Man H.Y. Ackerley C.A. Braunton J. Lu W.Y. Becker L.E. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Nature. 1997; 388: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and channels (34Sharma N. D'Arcangelo G. Kleinklaus A. Halegoua S. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although the mechanism for these effects is not completely understood. Tyrosine phosphorylation is important in G protein-coupled receptor internalization (35Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tyrosine phosphorylation enhances the interaction of the receptor with proteins involved in trafficking (36Karoor V. Wang L. Wang H-Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33035-33041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Transporters have been shown to associate with a number of trafficking proteins (9Deken S. Beckman M. Boos L. Quick M.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 37Torres G.E. Yao W.-D. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K.-M. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7571-7578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is possible that tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 regulates the ability of the transporter to interact with such components. In addition to decreasing the rate of transporter internalization, tyrosine phosphorylation of the transporter may also affect other aspects of the transporter trafficking process, such as externalization. For the type 4 glucose transporter, insulin causes both a decrease in internalization rates and an increase in externalization rates, leading to net increases in surface transporter expression (39Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For GAT1, the magnitude of the decrease in transporter internalization rates would appear to account for the net change in GAT1 surface expression, but we cannot rule out a change in transporter externalization rates in the presence of tyrosine phosphorylation. We are presently pursuing this question, although to date our direct externalization measurements are confounded by ongoing transporter internalization during the assay. Regardless, the ability of transporter ligands to regulate at least one arm of the transporter recycling process via tyrosine phosphorylation reveals a link between the triggers for transporter redistribution and their underlying molecular mechanisms."

We previously reported that the binding stoichiometry of integrin αIIbβ3:talin is ∼2:1. More recently, an integrin binding site has been localized to the talin head domain. In the present study, we identified another integrin binding site at the C-terminal region of the talin rod domain. In a solid phase binding assay, RGD affinity-purified αIIbβ3bound in a dose-dependent manner to microtiter wells coated with the isolated 190-kDa proteolytic fragment of the talin rod domain. Additionally, αIIbβ3 also bound to the talin rod domain captured by 8d4, an anti-talin monoclonal antibody. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a recombinant protein fragment corresponding to the entire talin rod domain (anti-talin-R) inhibited αIIbβ3 binding to intact talin by ∼50% but completely blocked αIIbβ3 binding to the talin rod domain. To localize the integrin binding site, we examined αIIbβ3 binding to recombinant polypeptide fragments corresponding to partial sequences of the talin rod domain. Whereas αIIbβ3 bound effectively to talin-(1075–2541) and talin-(1984–2541), it failed to bind to talin-(434–1076) and talin-(434–1975). Furthermore, the binding of αIIbβ3 to talin-(1984–2541) was inhibited by anti-talin-R. These results indicate that an integrin binding site is located within residues 1984–2541 of the talin rod domain. Thus, talin contains two integrin binding sites, one in the homologous FERM (band four-point-one, ezrin,radixin, moesin) domain and another near its C terminus. Because talin exists as an anti-parallel homodimer in focal adhesions, the two integrin binding sites in the adjacent talin molecules would be in close proximity with each other."
https://openalex.org/W1999493392,"In this paper we report calculations of electrostatic interactions between the transducin (Gt) βγ heterodimer (Gtβγ) and phospholipid membranes. Although membrane association of Gtβγ is due primarily to the hydrophobic penetration into the membrane interior of a farnesyl chain attached to the γ subunit, structural studies have revealed that there is a prominent patch of basic residues on the surface of the β subunit surrounding the site of farnesylation that is exposed upon dissociation from the Gtα subunit. Moreover, phosducin, which produces dissociation of Gtβγ from membranes, interacts directly with Gtβγ and introduces a cluster of acidic residues into this region. The calculations, which are based on the finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann method, account for a number of experimental observations and suggest that charged residues play a role in mediating protein-membrane interactions. Specifically, the calculations predict the following. 1) Favorable electrostatic interactions enhance the membrane partitioning due to the farnesyl group by an order of magnitude although Gtβγ has a large net negative charge (−12). 2) This electrostatic attraction positions Gtβγ so that residues implicated in mediating the interaction of Gtβγ with its membrane-bound effectors are close to the membrane surface. 3) The binding of phosducin to Gtβγ diminishes the membrane partitioning of Gtβγ by an order of magnitude. 4) Lowering the ionic strength of the solution converts the electrostatic attraction into a repulsion. Sequence analysis and homology model building suggest that our conclusions may be generalized to other Gβγ and phosducin isoforms as well.

Many proteins involved in interfacial signaling contain a lipophilic modification (e.g. myristate and farnesyl) that contributes to membrane association by partitioning hydrophobically into the membrane interior (1Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 2Bhatnagar R.S. Gordon J.I. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 14-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Examples of such proteins include heterotrimeric G proteins, small GTPases, and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. A lipid modification alone usually cannot provide enough energy to keep a protein anchored to a cellular membrane (3McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) and often occurs in conjunction with additional membrane binding motifs. For example, most Src family kinases (1Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), H- and N-Ras (4Magee T. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1999; 98: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and many Gα subunits (5Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) have dual lipophilic modifications, while other proteins, e.g. K-Ras4B (6Hancock J.F. Paterson H.

A. 1994; 91: 12253-12257Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), have both a lipophilic attachment and an adjacent cluster of basic residues that are attracted electrostatically to the charged surface of lipid bilayers. Heterotrimeric G proteins are acylated on the α subunit and prenylated on the γ subunit, and the membrane association of the inactive heterotrimer is due primarily to the penetration of both of these lipophilic modifications into the hydrocarbon region of the membrane (10Bigay J. Faurobert E. Franco M. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14081-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The exchange of GTP for GDP on the α subunit, catalyzed by an activated G protein-coupled receptor, results in the dissociation of Gα from the Gβγ heterodimer. Gα isoforms that are dually acylated remain membrane-associated upon activation, but the α subunit of transducin (Gtα), which is singly acylated, becomes primarily cytosolic (5Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 11Kokame K. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gtβγ, which is singly farnesylated, remains localized to rod outer segment (ROS)1membranes. As discussed below there is some experimental evidence suggesting that electrostatic interactions play a role in the membrane association of Gtβγ, but the situation is far from clear. In this paper, we address the issue by using computational methods to characterize the nature of the electrostatic component to the membrane partitioning of βγ heterodimers from transducin and other heterotrimeric G proteins as well. The observations that Gtβγ binds more strongly to vesicles formed from the acidic lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) than to vesicles formed from the zwitterionic lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) provides direct evidence for the role of ionic interactions in membrane association (12Matsuda T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Murata M. Asano T. Yoshizawa T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30358-30363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Seitz H.R. Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Alt T. Pellaud J. Seelig A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7950-7960Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, analysis of the crystal structure of Gtβγ (14Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) reveals a region of positive electrostatic potential surrounding the site of farnesylation, which should be attracted to a negatively charged surface (Fig.1 A). On the other hand, Gtβγ has a net negative charge as is evident from the potentials depicted in Fig.1 A, which could, in principle, serve to weaken membrane binding. Moreover, Gtβγ can be isolated from ROS membranes under low salt conditions (10Bigay J. Faurobert E. Franco M. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14081-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Bigay J. Chabre M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), an observation that would appear inconsistent with an electrostatic attraction between the protein and membrane. Finally, as discussed below, there is evidence that farnesylation alone is sufficient to anchor Gtβγ to ROS membranes so that the need for an additional anchoring motif is unclear. A related issue concerns the physical basis of the regulatory function of phosducin, a phosphoprotein that both inhibits the interaction of Gtβγ with GDP-bound Gtα and causes the translocation of Gtβγ from membrane to cytoplasm (16Tanaka H. Kuo C.H. Matsuda M. Fukada Y. Hayashi F. Ding Y. Irie Y. Miki N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Structural studies show that the binding of phosducin to Gtβγ introduces a cluster of negatively charged residues adjacent to the basic cluster on Gtβ (Fig.1 B) (17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates, in a qualitative sense, how electrostatics may affect the membrane association of Gtβγ: the positive electrostatic potential due to the basic surface patch on Gtβγ should be attracted to acidic lipids in the membrane, while the negative electrostatic potential due to the cluster of acidic residues on phosducin should be repelled from acidic lipids. In this paper, the validity of this qualitative picture is examined with detailed calculations of electrostatic free energies. The calculations reported here are based on the finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) methodology (18Honig B.H. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). The FDPB method has been used to describe the membrane association of simple model basic peptides (19Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 561-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), small basic protein toxins (20Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Miller C. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1717-1727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the membrane binding region of Src (21Murray D. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Buser C.A. Tsang J. Sigal C. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2145-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and, as summarized below, has yielded results that are in close agreement with experimental observations. In each of these cases electrostatic interactions were found to make a large contribution to membrane binding. For Gtβγ, both the available experimental evidence and our calculations suggest the electrostatic interactions are weaker but still significant. Specifically we find that electrostatic interactions could play a role in 1) increasing the membrane partitioning of free Gtβγ, 2) positioning Gtβγ at the membrane surface to facilitate productive protein-protein interactions, and 3) favoring the cytosolic state of phosducin-bound Gtβγ. In the calculations, Gtβγ, phosducin, and the lipid bilayer are represented in atomic detail, while the solvent is modeled as a homogeneous dielectric medium. The nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation is solved in the finite difference approximation (18Honig B.H. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), and electrostatic free energies are obtained from the calculated potentials (22Sharp K.A. Honig B.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 7684-7692Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Using the FDPB methodology, the electrostatic contribution to the binding free energy of both Gtβγ and Gtβγ·phosducin to PC/PS membranes is calculated as a function of 1) the distance of the protein from the membrane surface, 2) the orientation of the protein at the membrane surface, 3) the mole percent PS in the membrane, and 4) the ionic strength of the solution. The calculations are similar to those performed in the past to describe the membrane binding of basic peptides and proteins (19Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 561-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Miller C. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1717-1727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Murray D. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Buser C.A. Tsang J. Sigal C. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2145-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Murray D. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Structure. 1997; 5: 985-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). An example of an atomic model system treated here is depicted in Fig. 2. Six different lipid bilayers (1:0, 8:1, 5:1, 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1 PC/PS) were built as described previously (24Peitzsch R.M. Eisenberg M. Sharp K.A. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Each lipid leaflet contains up to 396 lipids distributed uniformly in a hexagonal lattice. Each lipid head group occupies an area of 68 Å2 in the plane of the membrane, and the lipid head group regions from the two opposing membrane leaflets encompass about ½ the thickness of the bilayer in agreement with experimental measurements of the structures of phospholipid bilayers (25Wiener M.C. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 437-447Google Scholar). It is assumed that the lipids change neither structure nor position upon interaction with the protein. A number of concerns arise with regard to this assumption. First, the effects of the farnesyl group on membrane structure are unknown. However, the electrostatic effects treated in this paper are long range and, thus, are unlikely to be strongly affected by local perturbations due to a farnesyl moiety. In fact, previous work has treated basic/aromatic peptides, which interact with the membrane surface through both electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic penetration of the membrane interface (35Burden L.M. Rao V.D. Doughman S.D. Murray D. Ghirlando R. Anderson R.A. Hurley J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15141-15149Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); the calculations agree well with the experimental data. Second, the membrane may respond dynamically to the charged protein to minimize the total free energy of the system. We do not treat such effects here, but they would serve to enhance the magnitude of the electrostatic interactions calculated in this paper so that the major conclusion would not be altered. Third, a likely mode of response of the bilayer to the approach of the charged protein would be expected to involve PS colocalization. This possibility will be considered in detail below. More generally, the approximation of a rigid bilayer is quite reasonable for Gtβγ and the Gtβγ·phosducin complex because both are highly charged and, thus, should not significantly penetrate the membrane interface (see Fig. 1). Previous work has shown that the membrane partitioning of basic peptides that reside outside the polar envelope of the membrane is independent of whether the membrane is in the liquid crystalline or gel phase (26Kim J. Mosior M. Chung L.A. Wu H. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 135-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), suggesting that the use of static bilayer models is appropriate for calculating the binding of peripheral proteins (19Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 561-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 27Montich G. Scarlata S. McLaughlin S. Lehrmann R. Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1146: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The assumption that the positive potential of the protein does not induce a significant local redistribution of monovalent acidic lipids in the plane of the membrane is consistent with direct spin-label electron spin resonance studies that show pentalysine does not produce a redistribution of acidic lipids in membranes (28Kleinschmidt J.H. Marsh D. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 2546-2555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and with membrane partitioning studies of myristate-Src-(2–19) that show that the membrane binding of the peptide does not saturate as a function of mole percent acidic lipid (21Murray D. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Buser C.A. Tsang J. Sigal C. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2145-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These studies were all performed with simple peptides and do not necessarily address the effect of a large protein on the membrane structure. To obtain an estimate of the effect of acidic lipid aggregation on the membrane interaction of Gtβγ, a calculation of the electrostatic free energy of interaction was performed with “hybrid” membrane models: the region of a 2:1 PC/PS bilayer immediately below Gtβγ was replaced by a comparable region of either a 1:1 or 0:1 PC/PS bilayer. The substituted bilayer section encompassed 48 lipids and had a surface area of 3300 Å2, which is consistent with the imprint of Gtβγ on the membrane surface (3700 Å2). As discussed below, our results indicate that the assumption of a uniform lateral distribution of acidic lipids is not a severe one at least for 2:1 PC/PS, the composition primarily used in this study. The dimensions of a lipid bilayer containing 396 lipids per leaflet are ∼165 × 172 × 60 Å. The largest lateral dimension for the protein structures examined is 78 Å; therefore, the lateral dimensions of the membranes extend several Debye lengths beyond the edge of the protein, and the calculations account for the full protein-membrane electrostatic interaction in 100 mmKCl. At lower ionic strengths (or longer Debye lengths), calculations were performed with larger bilayers, and these confirm the results obtained with the bilayers containing 396 lipids per leaflet. The experimentally determined structures of Gtβγ (Refs.14Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar and 29Loew A.

Structure. 1998; 6: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar; PDB codes 2trc and1aor) were used in the calculations. Hydrogen atoms were added to the heavy atoms in the structures with the program CHARMM (30Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). The structures with hydrogens were subjected to conjugate gradient minimization with a harmonic restraint force of 50 kcal/mol/Å2 applied to the heavy atoms located at the original crystallographic coordinates. The calculations performed with the structure of Gtβγ from the Gtβγ·phosducin complex of Gaudet et al.(17Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (PDB code 2trc) are presented in this work because this structure includes more residues at the C terminus of the γ subunit than the other structures. The root mean square deviation between the Cα traces of phosducin-bound Gtβγ and free Gtβγ is only 0.9 Å, indicating that the structures are highly similar. Calculations of the electrostatic contribution to the binding of free Gtβγ (PDB code 1tbg) to membranes as a function of mole percent acidic lipid and ionic strength gave results quantitatively similar to those obtained for Gtβγ from the Gtβγ·phosducin complex (PDB code 2trc). As visualized in GRASP (31Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) the electrostatic equipotential contours of the Gtβγ·phosducin structure (PDB code 1aor), not included in our calculations, are qualitatively similar to those for the complex (PDB code 2trc) we examined in detail, again suggesting that the electrostatic component of the membrane interaction would be similar for both structures. Each atom of the protein and membrane is assigned a radius and partial charge; the protein/membrane model is then mapped onto a three-dimensional grid of l 3 points, each of which represents a small region of the protein, membrane, or solvent (32Gilson M.K. Sharp K.A. Honig B.H. J. Comp. Chem. 1987; 9: 327-335Crossref Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The charges and radii used for the amino acids were taken from a CHARMM22 parameter set (30Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar); those used for the lipids were taken from Peitzsch et al. (24Peitzsch R.M. Eisenberg M. Sharp K.A. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and were used in previous studies (19Ben-Tal N. Honig B.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2145-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Molecular surfaces for the protein and membrane are generated by rolling a spherical probe with the radius of a water molecule (1.4 Å) over the surfaces defined by the van der Waals radii of the constituent atoms; the point of contact between the probe and the van der Waals surface defines the molecular surface. Grid points that lie within the molecular surfaces of the peptides and bilayer are assigned a dielectric constant of 2, and grid points outside the molecular surfaces, corresponding to the aqueous phase, are assigned a dielectric constant of 80. Salt ions are excluded from a region that extends 2 Å beyond the van der Waals surfaces of the peptide and membrane. The electrostatic potential and the mean distribution of the monovalent salt ions at each grid point are calculated by solving numerically the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation as described previously (19Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 561-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The electrostatic contribution to the binding free energy is obtained as the difference in the free energy of the protein/membrane system and of the individual components (22Sharp K.A. Honig B.H. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 7684-7692Crossref Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The Poisson-Boltzmann equation was represented on the lattice using the finite difference approximation. The quasi-Newton method for treating the nonlinear portion of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation was combined with three levels of multigriddings to solve the equation (33Holst M. Saied F. J. Comp. Chem. 1993; 14: 105-113Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The FDPB calculations were done to resolutions of 2.0 and 3.0 grid spacings/Å. Focusing (32Gilson M.K. Sharp K.A. Honig B.H. J. Comp. Chem. 1987; 9: 327-335Crossref Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 19Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 561-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), in which the system is represented on the computational grid at successively higher resolutions until the final resolution is achieved (i.e. 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 grid/Å and 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, and 3.0 grid/Å), was used to increase the precision of the calculations. The calculation of the electrostatic potential at each resolution was iterated to convergence defined as the point at which the potential changes less than 10−5 kT/e (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the charge of a proton) between successive iterations. The numerical uncertainty of the calculation of the electrostatic free energy of interaction, as judged by the change between the two highest resolution scales (either 1.0 and 2.0 grid/Å or 1.5 and 3.0 grid/Å), is within 0.2 kcal/mol. A similar protocol has been used in previous work (19Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys.

The electrostatic contribution to the membrane partition coefficient was determined by calculating the Gibbs surface excess of protein at the membrane surface, i.e. the number of moles of protein bound per unit area of membrane surface (19Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 561-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the electrostatic free energy curve for Gβγ in a single orientation at the surface of a 2:1 PC/PS membrane in 100 mm KCl. The product of the protein concentration at infinity (i.e. in the bulk solution) and the exponent of the interaction energy is a measure of the protein concentration at each distance from the membrane surface. To approximate a complete ensemble of different protein/membrane configurations, such an energy curve was calculated for many different orientations of the protein at the membrane surface, and the concentration at each distance was obtained by averaging over the different orientations (21Murray D. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Buser C.A. Tsang J. Sigal C. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2145-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23Murray D. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. McLaughlin S. Structure. 1997; 5: 985-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Then averaging over the distance itself gives the Gibbs surface excess, which is simply related to the molar partition coefficient. We followed the procedure developed for calculating the electrostatic contribution to the membrane partitioning of a myristoylated peptide corresponding to the N terminus of Src (21Murray D. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Buser C.A. Tsang J. Sigal C. Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2145-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We assumed that electrostatic interactions between Gtβγ and the membrane occur with the farnesyl fully partitioned into the membrane. This approximation is reasonable because the contribution of the farnesyl is likely to be much greater than that due to electrostatics (∼103 versus ∼10m−1, see also “Discussion”). Thus, in our model, we assume the farnesyl “anchor” restricts the protein to a region of space above the membrane (Fig. 2). We also assumed that the structure of nonfarnesylated Gtβγ is a good approximation to the farnesylated form; the only residues missing from the C terminus of the γ subunit used in our calculations are GGC, which are not expected to affect membrane partitioning (37Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar).

Although many proteins are present in this intracellular vesicle membrane, five are specific to this membrane. A 16-kDa protein, designated Mms16, is the most abundant of the magnetosome-specific proteins, and to establish its function we cloned and sequenced its gene fromMagnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. This was achieved by determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein following two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and sequencing of the gene was performed by gene walking using anchored polymerase chain reaction. Mms16 contains a putative ATP/GTP binding motif (P-loop). Recombinant Mms16 with a hemagglutinin tag, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Recombinant Mms16 protein could bind GTP and showed GTPase activity. GTP was the preferred substrate for Mms16-catalyzed nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis.

They are covered with a thin lipid membrane and have an average diameter of 50–100 nm. The morphology of these bacterial magnetic particles (BMPs)1 is species-dependent, and it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that species-specific biological factors located in the BMP membrane mediate magnetite crystallization (1Bazylinski D.A. Frankel R.B. Heywood B. Mann S. King J.W. Donaghay P.L. Hanson A.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3232-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of BMP synthesis, including vesicle formation, still remains unclear. A complete understanding of biomineralization and of membrane vesicle formation at the molecular level will also have important implications for studying biomineralization in general and vesicle formation in prokaryotes in particular.Several processes are involved in BMP synthesis, and one of the most important is vesicle formation. Numerous studies have been devoted to the investigation of eukaryotic intracellular vesicle formation, and hence the molecular machinery is well understood (for reviews, see Refs. 2Schmid S.L. Damke H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and 3Rothman J.E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, there are few molecular studies of vesicle formation or of the events leading to invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane in prokaryotes. We have hypothesized that the BMP membrane is derived from the cytoplasmic membrane and formed through the invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane by a process similar that which occurs in eukaryotes (4Matsunaga T. Tsujimura N. Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).A second process in BMP synthesis is magnetite crystallization, and this has been studied in more detail. It appears that ferric iron is reduced on the cell surface, taken into the cytoplasm, transferred into vesicles (magnetosomes), and finally oxidized to produce magnetite (5Frankel R.B. Papaefthymiou G.C. Blakemore R.P. O'Brien W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 147-159Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Several proteins appear to be required for magnetite crystallization, and the first of these reported,magA, was cloned from a non-magnetic mutant obtained by transposon mutagenesis of Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 (6Nakamura C. Burgess J.G. Sode K. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28392-38396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Internal localization analysis of the MagA protein using a MagA-luciferase fusion protein indicated that MagA is localized on the BMP membrane where it transports iron into the BMP vesicles (6Nakamura C. Burgess J.G. Sode K. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28392-38396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura C. Kikuchi T. Burgess J.G. Matsunaga T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus magnetosomal membrane proteins play an important role in magnetite crystal formation.Other proteins on the BMP membrane have been partially characterized. Gorby et al. observed two unique proteins in the BMP membrane fraction from M. magnetotacticum MS-1 (8Gorby Y.A. Beveridge T.J. Blakemore R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 834-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Okudaet al. identified three additional specific proteins in the BMP membrane of MS-1, and they determined the DNA/amino acid sequence of a 22-kDa protein (9Okuda Y. Denda K. Fukumori Y. Gene. 1996; 171: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, since gene transfer and its use in studying gene expression has not been successful in strain MS-1, the function of these proteins is still unknown. In strain AMB-1, three BMP membrane-specific proteins were identified and partially characterized. One of these, MpsA, which shows homology with acetyl-CoA carboxylase (transferase), containing acyl-CoA binding motif (4Matsunaga T. Tsujimura N. Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Recently, we have found two additional BMP-specific proteins, a 12-kDa and a 16-kDa protein (10Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. Appl. Biochem. Biotech. 2000; 84–86: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) bringing the total number in strain AMB-1 to five (Table I). The 16-kDa protein was found to be the most abundantly expressed of the five BMP-specific proteins. In this work, we therefore cloned, sequenced, and partially characterized this 16-kDa protein. Although the MagA protein is important for BMP formation, it is not specific to the BMP membrane but is also present on the cytoplasmic membrane (7Nakamura C. Kikuchi T. Burgess J.G. Matsunaga T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the 16-kDa protein is confirmed as a specific protein expressed on the BMP membrane. 2M. Takahashi, Y. Okamura, H. Takeyama, and T. Mastunaga, manuscript in preparation. 2M. Takahashi, Y. Okamura, H. Takeyama, and T. Mastunaga, manuscript in preparation. Thus, this is the first report of the experimental function of BMP-specific protein. We conclude that the 16-kDa protein is a GTPase with properties similar to eukaryotic small GTPases that control vesicle trafficking. Furthermore, inhibition of GTPase by aluminum fluoride prevents BMP synthesis suggesting that GTPase activity is required for BMP synthesis.Table IBMP-specific proteins in M. magneticum AMB-1Molecular massProtein namePutative functionObservation in other strainReferencekDa66.2not isolated435.6MpsAacyl-CoA transferase424.8MAM22tetratricopeptideMS-14,8,11repeat familyMSR-116.0Mms16GTP-binding protein10, this study12.0not isolated10 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThis work reports the functional analysis of a magnetosome-specific protein from a magnetic bacterium for the first time. Mms16 protein, identified as the most abundant protein in magnetosomes, contains a putative P-loop sequence; however, this putative P-loop sequence has only three residues of any combination of four between Gly and Gly-Lys, and it contains only one motif of the four conserved sequence motifs in the GTPase superfamily (31Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar). Despite these characteristics, Mms16 protein shows GTPase activity. The Ras, Rho, Rab, and Ran of small GTPase family were also observed to have spontaneous GTPase activity (32Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the isolated Mms16 is similar to these GTPases. For example, the intrinsic GTP dissociation rates of Ras are about 105 times lower than in Ras in the presence of an exchange factor (33Moser C. Mol O. Goody R. Sinning I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11339-11344Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, interactions of other proteins would be required for binding to the membrane, GTP/GDP exchange, or stimulation of the activities in situ similar to that in eukaryotic cells. Probably, this Mms16 is also controlled by some factors in vivo, hence GTPase is expected to act in much lower levels of GTP concentration.The Mms16 was localized in the cytoplasm of E. coli but was strongly associated with the BMP membrane since it was not removed when subjected to over 20 times stringent washing with sonication. Therefore, it appears to be directly associated with the membrane. Motif analysis of Mms16 indicated that it contained a myristoylation site; however, the site is not at the N terminus. ARF, one of the family of mammalian small GTPases, is anchored in the membrane by myristoylation of Gly at the N terminus (34Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From observation of such a membrane-bound form and GTP hydrolysis activity, the Mms16 has similar properties to eukaryotic small GTPases. Therefore, it is anticipated that its function may also be similar.It does not seem to be similar to other prokaryotic GTP-binding proteins that have also been widely studied and fall into five groups; (i) initiation factor (IF-2), elongation factor (EF-Tu) (35Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 505: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), (ii) cytokinesis protein FtsZ, which forms a ring at the leading edge of the cell division site (36Lutkenhaus J. Mol. Microiol. 1993; 9: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and is a GTPase that has significant structural similarity to tubulin (37de Bore P. Crossley R. Rothfield L. Nature. 1992; 359: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), (iii) signal recognition particle (SRP) and SRP receptor α subunit (38Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P.

Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7155-7160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Vidwans S.J. Ireton K. Grossman A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3308-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although its precise cellular function is unknown, Era and Obg have been implicated in a wide array of cellular functions.Eukaryotic cells have an elaborate network of organelles, many of which are in constant and bi-directional communication through a flow of small transport vesicles. The small transport vesicles that mediate membrane trafficking between intracellular organelles are encased in a protein coat. The small GTPase family is involved in the priming and budding of trafficking vesicles. Well studied examples of vesicle formation include the Golgi-derived COP (coat protein)-coated vesicles (46Ostermann J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 47Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). In events leading to the formation of COP-coated vesicles, N-myristoylated ARF (48Kahn R.A. Goddard C. Newkirk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8282-8287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) anchored in the membrane is recruited concomitantly with GTP/GDP exchange at the Golgi surface (49Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) where it triggers assembly of the coatmer (50Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 51Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J.M. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol.

GTP hydrolysis is required to release the coatmer complex and ARF from the vesicles (46Ostermann J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 47Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar).In several bacteria, intracellular membranal structures clearly originate from the cytoplasmic membrane. Although the origin of the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria are not known, in most phototrophic bacteria, intracytoplasmic membranes that are invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane, are the site of the photosynthetic apparatus (53Kondratieva E.N. Pfennig N. Truper H.G. Balows A. Truper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.-H. The Prokaryotes. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1992: 312-330Google Scholar). Also chemolithotrophic, nitrifying bacteria possess complex arrangements of internal membranes (54Watson S.W. Bock E. Harms H. Koops H.-P. Hooper A.B. Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology.in: Staley J.T. Bryant M.P. Pfennig N. Holt J.G. 3. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1989: 1808-1834Google Scholar). Spheroplasts ofNitrosomonas do not contain internal vesicles (55Hooper A.B. Tran V.M. Balny C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggests that internal membranes of those organisms are invaginations. Methanotrophs generally contain intracytoplasmic membranes (56Anthony C. The Biochemistry of Methylotrophs. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar), which appear to be involved in the methane oxidation pathway. Azoarcus sp. BH72 is a chemoheterotroph, and their intracytoplasmic membranes, related to nitrogen fixation, often appear as stacks of flattened vesicles similar to those of many phototrophic bacteria (57Hurek T. Montagu M.V. Kellenberger E. Reinhold-Hurek B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the process of intracytoplasmic membrane formation is poorly understood in prokaryotes and no genes involved in this process have yet been isolated.In magnetic bacteria, the origin of membrane vesicles that envelope the magnetite particles is unknown. We can hypothesize that magnetosomes arise through invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane. The BMP specific GTPase may also be involved in vesicle formation through a process similar to that which occurs in eukaryotic vesicle formation. Inhibition of GTPase activity by AlF4− causes inhibition of BMP synthesis, suggesting that GTPase activity is required for BMP formation.In previous studies, we have reported two proteins, MagA and MpsA, presented on the BMP membrane. MagA is expressed on both BMP and cytoplasmic membrane and showed iron transport activity. Interestingly, MagA topology is inversely oriented between the cytoplasmic membrane and the BMP membrane (6Nakamura C. Burgess J.G. Sode K. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28392-38396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura C. Kikuchi T. Burgess J.G. Matsunaga T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), something that would occur if magnetosomes were formed by membrane invagination. MpsA, acyl-CoA transferase homologue, is present specifically on the BMP membrane in higher amounts than MagA, but its function is unknown. In eukaryotes, ARF requires acylation for membranal invagination (58Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our previous studies and this study, we have proposed a mechanism for the primary formation of BMP. The Mms16 binds with the membrane. And this serves to prime the invagination from the cytoplasmic membrane. Acyl-CoA and GTP hydrolysis might be required during vesicle budding. MagA takes up ferric iron into the vesicle released from cytoplasmic membrane. Magnetic bacteria synthesize intracellular magnetite particles that are aligned in chains of around 10 particles per cell. They are covered with a thin lipid membrane and have an average diameter of 50–100 nm. The morphology of these bacterial magnetic particles (BMPs)1 is species-dependent, and it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that species-specific biological factors located in the BMP membrane mediate magnetite crystallization (1Bazylinski D.A. Frankel R.B. Heywood B. Mann S. King J.W. Donaghay P.L. Hanson A.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 3232-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of BMP synthesis, including vesicle formation, still remains unclear. A complete understanding of biomineralization and of membrane vesicle formation at the molecular level will also have important implications for studying biomineralization in general and vesicle formation in prokaryotes in particular.

Internal localization analysis of the MagA protein using a MagA-luciferase fusion protein indicated that MagA is localized on the BMP membrane where it transports iron into the BMP vesicles (6Nakamura C.

Other proteins on the BMP membrane have been partially characterized. Gorby et al. observed two unique proteins in the BMP membrane fraction from M. magnetotacticum MS-1 (8Gorby Y.A. Beveridge T.J. Blakemore R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 834-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Okudaet al. identified three additional specific proteins in the BMP membrane of MS-1, and they determined the DNA/amino acid sequence of a 22-kDa protein (9Okuda Y. Denda K. Fukumori Y. Gene. 1996; 171: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, since gene transfer and its use in studying gene expression has not been successful in strain MS-1, the function of these proteins is still unknown. In strain AMB-1, three BMP membrane-specific proteins were identified and partially characterized. One of these, MpsA, which shows homology with acetyl-CoA carboxylase (transferase), containing acyl-CoA binding motif (4Matsunaga T. Tsujimura N. Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The 16-kDa protein was found to be the most abundantly expressed of the five BMP-specific proteins. In this work, we therefore cloned, sequenced, and partially characterized this 16-kDa protein. Although the MagA protein is important for BMP formation, it is not specific to the BMP membrane but is also present on the cytoplasmic membrane (7Nakamura C. Kikuchi T. Burgess J.G. Matsunaga T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the 16-kDa protein is confirmed as a specific protein expressed on the BMP membrane. 2M. Takahashi, Y. Okamura, H. Takeyama, and T. Mastunaga, manuscript in preparation. 2M. Takahashi, Y. Okamura, H. Takeyama, and T. Mastunaga, manuscript in preparation. Thus, this is the first report of the experimental function of BMP-specific protein. We conclude that the 16-kDa protein is a GTPase with properties similar to eukaryotic small GTPases that control vesicle trafficking. Furthermore, inhibition of GTPase by aluminum fluoride prevents BMP synthesis suggesting that GTPase activity is required for BMP synthesis. DISCUSSIONThis work reports the functional analysis of a magnetosome-specific protein from a magnetic bacterium for the first time. Mms16 protein, identified as the most abundant protein in magnetosomes, contains a putative P-loop sequence; however, this putative P-loop sequence has only three residues of any combination of four between Gly and Gly-Lys, and it contains only one motif of the four conserved sequence motifs in the GTPase superfamily (31Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar). Despite these characteristics, Mms16 protein shows GTPase activity. The Ras, Rho, Rab, and Ran of small GTPase family were also observed to have spontaneous GTPase activity (32Weiss O. Holden J. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21066-21072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the isolated Mms16 is similar to these GTPases. For example, the intrinsic GTP dissociation rates of Ras are about 105 times lower than in Ras in the presence of an exchange factor (33Moser C. Mol O. Goody R. Sinning I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11339-11344Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, interactions of other proteins would be required for binding to the membrane, GTP/GDP exchange, or stimulation of the activities in situ similar to that in eukaryotic cells. Probably, this Mms16 is also controlled by some factors in vivo, hence GTPase is expected to act in much lower levels of GTP concentration.The Mms16 was localized in the cytoplasm of E. coli but was strongly associated with the BMP membrane since it was not removed when subjected to over 20 times stringent washing with sonication. Therefore, it appears to be directly associated with the membrane. Motif analysis of Mms16 indicated that it contained a myristoylation site; however, the site is not at the N terminus. ARF, one of the family of mammalian small GTPases, is anchored in the membrane by myristoylation of Gly at the N terminus (34Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. Serafini T. Weiss O. Rulka C. Clark J. Amherdt M. Roller P. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13039-13046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From observation of such a membrane-bound form and GTP hydrolysis activity, the Mms16 has similar properties to eukaryotic small GTPases. Therefore, it is anticipated that its function may also be similar.It does not seem to be similar to other prokaryotic GTP-binding proteins that have also been widely studied and fall into five groups; (i) initiation factor (IF-2), elongation factor (EF-Tu) (35Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 505: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), (ii) cytokinesis protein FtsZ, which forms a ring at the leading edge of the cell division site (36Lutkenhaus J. Mol. Microiol. 1993; 9: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and is a GTPase that has significant structural similarity to tubulin (37de Bore P. Crossley R. Rothfield L. Nature. 1992; 359: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), (iii) signal recognition particle (SRP) and SRP receptor α subunit (38Miller J.D. Bernstein H.D. Walter P. Nature. 1994; 367: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), (iv) Era protein, which encodes an essential protein (39Inada T. Kawakami K. Chen S.-M. Takiff H.E. Court D.L. Nakamura Y. J.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2581-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that may play a role in DNA replication or chromosome partitioning in E. coli (42Britton R.A. Powell B.S. Court D.L. Lupski J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4575-4582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Britton R.A. Powell B.S. Dasgupta S. Sun Q. Margolin W. Lupski J.R. Court D.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and (v) Obg protein, which plays a crucial role in sporulation and DNA replication in Bacillus subtilis (44Kok J. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7155-7160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Vidwans S.J. Ireton K. Grossman A.D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3308-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although its precise cellular function is unknown, Era and Obg have been implicated in a wide array of cellular functions.Eukaryotic cells have an elaborate network of organelles, many of which are in constant and bi-directional communication through a flow of small transport vesicles. The small transport vesicles that mediate membrane trafficking between intracellular organelles are encased in a protein coat. The small GTPase family is involved in the priming and budding of trafficking vesicles. Well studied examples of vesicle formation include the Golgi-derived COP (coat protein)-coated vesicles (46Ostermann J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E.

In events leading to the formation of COP-coated vesicles, N-myristoylated ARF (48Kahn R.A. Goddard C. Newkirk M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8282-8287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) anchored in the membrane is recruited concomitantly with GTP/GDP exchange at the Golgi surface (49Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) where it triggers assembly of the coatmer (50Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 51Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J.M. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol.

GTP hydrolysis is required to release the coatmer complex and ARF from the vesicles (46Ostermann J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 47Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar).In several bacteria, intracellular membranal structures clearly originate from the cytoplasmic membrane. Although the origin of the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria are not known, in most phototrophic bacteria, intracytoplasmic membranes that are invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane, are the site of the photosynthetic apparatus (53Kondratieva E.N. Pfennig N. Truper H.G. Balows A. Truper H.G. Dworkin M. Harder W. Schleifer K.-H. The Prokaryotes. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1992: 312-330Google Scholar). Also chemolithotrophic, nitrifying bacteria possess complex arrangements of internal membranes (54Watson S.W. Bock E. Harms H. Koops H.-P. Hooper A.B. Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology.in: Staley J.T. Bryant M.P. Pfennig N. Holt J.G. 3. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1989: 1808-1834Google Scholar). Spheroplasts ofNitrosomonas do not contain internal vesicles (55Hooper A.B. Tran V.M. Balny C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggests that internal membranes of those organisms are invaginations. Methanotrophs generally contain intracytoplasmic membranes (56Anthony C. The Biochemistry of Methylotrophs. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar), which appear to be involved in the methane oxidation pathway. Azoarcus sp. BH72 is a chemoheterotroph, and their intracytoplasmic membranes, related to nitrogen fixation, often appear as stacks of flattened vesicles similar to those of many phototrophic bacteria (57Hurek T. Montagu M.V. Kellenberger E. Reinhold-Hurek B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the process of intracytoplasmic membrane formation is poorly understood in prokaryotes and no genes involved in this process have yet been isolated.In magnetic bacteria, the origin of membrane vesicles that envelope the magnetite particles is unknown. We can hypothesize that magnetosomes arise through invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane. The BMP specific GTPase may also be involved in vesicle formation through a process similar to that which occurs in eukaryotic vesicle formation. Inhibition of GTPase activity by AlF4− causes inhibition of BMP synthesis, suggesting that GTPase activity is required for BMP formation.In previous studies, we have reported two proteins, MagA and MpsA, presented on the BMP membrane. MagA is expressed on both BMP and cytoplasmic membrane and showed iron transport activity. Interestingly, MagA topology is inversely oriented between the cytoplasmic membrane and the BMP membrane (6Nakamura C. Burgess J.G. Sode K. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28392-38396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura C. Kikuchi T. Burgess J.G. Matsunaga T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), something that would occur if magnetosomes were formed by membrane invagination. MpsA, acyl-CoA transferase homologue, is present specifically on the BMP membrane in higher amounts than MagA, but its function is unknown. In eukaryotes, ARF requires acylation for membranal invagination (58Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our previous studies and this study, we have proposed a mechanism for the primary formation of BMP. The Mms16 binds with the membrane. And this serves to prime the invagination from the cytoplasmic membrane. Acyl-CoA and GTP hydrolysis might be required during vesicle budding. MagA takes up ferric iron into the vesicle released from cytoplasmic membrane. This work reports the functional analysis of a magnetosome-specific protein from a magnetic bacterium for the first time.

Unlike cyclosporin A, however, the cyclophilin-sanglifehrin A complex has no effect on the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. It has been previously shown that sanglifehrin A specifically blocks T cell proliferation in response to interleukin 2 by inhibiting the appearance of cell cycle kinase activity cyclinE-Cdk2. How sanglifehrin A treatment leads to the cell cycle blockade has remained unknown. We report that sanglifehrin A is capable of activating the tumor suppressor gene p53 at the transcription level, leading to up-regulation of p21 that then binds and inhibits the cylcinE-Cdk2 complex. Further analysis of different elements in the p53 promoter showed that sanglifehrin A activates p53 transcription primarily through the activation of the transcription factor NFκB by activating IκB kinase in a manner that is similar to several genotoxic agents. Unlike other genotoxic drugs, sanglifehrin A does not cause DNA damage, making it a unique natural product that is capable of activating the NFκB signaling pathway without affecting DNA.

Inhibition of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin prevents the dephosphorylation of a critical transcription factor, NFAT, thereby blocking the transcription of a number of cytokine genes (5Crabtree G.R.

The binding of FKBP-rapamycin to RRAP/RAFT/TOR interferes with the function of TOR, leading to a blockade of cell cycle at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a new member of the immunophilin ligand superfamily. It was discovered through a screen for novel cyclophilin ligands that block T cell activation (19Sanglier J.J. Quesniaux V. Fehr T. Hofmann H. Mahnke M. Memmert K. Schuler W. Zenke G. Gschwind L. Maurer C. Schilling W. J. Antibiot.

(Tokyo). 1999; 52: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similar to CsA, SFA binds to cyclophilin with high affinity. Unlike CsA, however, the cyclophilin-SFA complex has no effect on the phosphatase activity of calcineurin (21Zenke G. Strittmatter U. Fuchs S. Quesniaux V.F.J. Brinkmann V. Schuler W. Zurini M. Enz A. Billich A. Sanglier J.J. Fehr T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7165-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although SFA was shown to inhibit mouse and human mixed lymphocyte reactions (19Sanglier J.J. Quesniaux V. Fehr T. Hofmann H. Mahnke M. Memmert K. Schuler W. Zenke G. Gschwind L. Maurer C. Schilling W. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1999; 52: 466-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we and others have recently found that SFA does not affect T cell receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways leading to the production of cytokines such as IL-2 (21Zenke G. Strittmatter U. Fuchs S. Quesniaux V.F.J. Brinkmann V. Schuler W. Zurini M. Enz A. Billich A. Sanglier J.J. Fehr T. J.

Instead, SFA inhibits IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation, similar to rapamycin (23Dumont F.J. Melino M.R. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L. Fischer P.A. Sigal N.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1418-1424PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bierer B.E. Mattila P.S. Standaert R.F. Herzenberg L.A. Burakoff S.J. Crabtree G. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9231-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Moreover, SFA blocks the cell cycle progression of T lymphocyte in response to IL-2 at the G1phase of the cell cycle, an effect also exhibited by rapamycin (22Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unlike rapamycin, however, the activation of the p70s6k activity was unaffected by SFA (22Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results indicate that SFA has a novel mechanism of action that is distinct from the other known immunophilin ligands, CsA, FK506, and rapamycin. Further studies revealed that SFA inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of Rb and abrogated the appearance of the G1cyclin-dependent kinase cyclinE-Cdk2 upon IL-2 stimulation (22Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, how SFA inhibits cell cycle progression has remained unknown. We report here that the cell cycle effect of SFA is not specific to T cells. Using the tumor cell line HCT 116 as a model system, we show that SFA stimulates the transcription of p53 and consequently p21, leading to a significant increase of p21 that is likely to be responsible for the G1 cell cycle blockade. The role of p53 as a mediator of SFA is underscored by the demonstration that p53 null mouse embryo fibroblasts gain significant, albeit not complete, resistance to SFA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the NFκB binding site in the p53 promoter is required for the SFA-induced transcriptional activation of p53. SFA was found to activate NFκB through the activation of the IκB kinase activity. Analysis of the integrity of the genomic DNA ruled out the possibility that SFA activates NFκB via DNA damage, making SFA a unique inducer of NFκB and p53. SFA was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Sedrani from Novartis Pharma Inc. (Basel, Switzerland). Doxorubicin, cycloheximide, ribonuclease A (RNase, type III-A), ATP, and propidium iodide were purchased from Sigma. [3H]thymidine, [γ-32P]ATP and ECL reagents were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. TitanTM One Tube RT-PCR System was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Purified polyclonal rabbit antibody to IκBα (c-21), IκBβ (c-20), IKKα (H-744), actin, mouse monoclonal antibody to p21 (F-5), p53 (Pab 240), and protein G/A-Sepharose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Human p53 luciferase reporter comprised of the 2.4-kilobase or 356-bp p53 promoter region were generated by excising the 2.4-kilobase XbaI fragment and the 356-bp XbaI-BamHI fragments of p53 promoter from pICAT vector and subcloning each into the SmaI site of pGL basic luciferase reporter vector from Promega after making each end blunt. pG13pyLuc was provided by Dr. Lazano (32Wu H. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations of the κB or HoxA5 binding sites in the 356-bp p53 reporter construct were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing. NFκB luciferase reporter construct was previously described (22Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for mutant IκBα, dominant negative IKKα, and GST-IκBα were kindly provided by Dr. Warner Greene (Univ. of California San Francisco). Wild type and knockout mouse embryos fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from day 13.5 mouse embryos as previously described (26Jacks T. Remington L. Williams B.O. Schmitt E.M. Halachmi S. Bronson R.T. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Human colon cancer cell line HCT 116 (p53+/+p73+/+, ATCC CCL247) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively), and 6 mm HEPES. The HCT 116 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Following treatment of cells with test agents, the 200 × g cell pellet was fixed in 2 ml of cold absolute ethanol at 4 °C for 1 h and then washed twice with cold PBS. The cells were resuspended in 1.76 ml of PBS to which 200 μl of RNase (1 mg/ml in PBS) and 40 μl of propidium iodide (2.5 mg/ml in PBS) were added. The cell suspension was incubated in the dark for 15 min and kept at 4 °C until analyses. The propidium iodide fluorescence of individual nuclei was determined using a Becton-Dickson FACScan (emission at 675 nm with excitation at 488 nm). Cell cycle distribution was analyzed with CellQuestTM v3.1 acquisition software and the ModFit LT v2.0 program. For whole cell lysate preparation, 1 × 107 cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% Triton X-100). After incubation at 4 °C for 15 min, the whole lysate was separated by microcentrifugation at full speed for 10 min at 4 °C. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as follows. Cells were lysed with cytoplasmic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A) and then centrifuged at 300 × g for 4 min. The supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in nuclear buffer (cytoplasmic buffer + 0.5 mNaCl) and incubated for 30 min on a rotator at 4 °C and then microcentrifuged at full speed for 30 min. The supernatants were collected as nuclear protein. The protein concentration in each sample was determined with Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were denatured by heating to 95 °C in Laemmli's sample buffer and were resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with indicated antibodies and detected using an ECL system per manufacturer's instruction. Whole cell lysate (200 μg of protein in 0.5 ml lysis buffer) was mixed with 4 μg of polyclonal rabbit anti-IKKα antibodies (H-744) and incubated at 4 °C on a rotator for 4 h. Protein G/A-Sepharose beads (30 μl) were added and the incubation was continued for an additional 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were isolated by centrifugation and washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer and once with 500 μl of ice-cold kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2). Pellets were then mixed with 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μg of recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-IκBα (1–62), 50 μm cold ATP, and 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3,000 Ci/mmol) on ice, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 3 × Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling in water for 5 min. The 32P-labeled GST-IκBα was resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography. TitanTM One Tube RT-PCR System was used to detect p53 and p21 mRNA. Total RNA (1 μg) from control and SFA-treated cells was reversed transcribed to synthesize the first-strand cDNA. Amplification was performed using primers specific for human p53, p21, or actin. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s (denaturation), 55 °C for 30 s (annealing), and 68 °C for 45 s (elongation) for a total of 30 cycles. PCR products were analyzed on 1.8% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. PCR reactions with either the reverse transcriptase or the template left out served as negative controls. For DNA transfection, HCT 116 cells were plated in 6-well plates (2 × 105/well/2 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and incubated until the cells were 50–80% confluent. The cells were transfected with 1–2 μg of various luciferase reporter plasmids and 1 μg of a pSV-β-gal control vector by LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, the cells were incubated in 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight. Cells were then treated in the presence or absence of SFA for 12 h. After SFA treatment, cells were harvested and lysed for luciferase assay according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega Co., Madison, WI). A total of 2 × 104MEF cells were seeded in triplicate to 96-well microtiter plates. Varying concentrations of SFA were added to each well to a final volume of 200 μl of medium. Following incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 20 h, [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 4 h. Cells were then harvested onto glass fiber mats using a 96-well harvester (TomTech, Orange, CT). The mats were dried and sealed in pouches with scintillation mixture (EcoScint, ICN, Costa Mess, CA), and radioactivity was determined in a Wallace 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter (Gaithersburg, MD). The median inhibition concentration (IC50) was defined as the drug concentration required to inhibit proliferative responses of cells by 50% and calculated from linear regression analysis. To determine the extent of DNA damage in cells, alkaline micro-gel electrophoresis or the “Comet” assay was performed under dim light as described previously with slight modifications (27Ostling O. Johanson K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 28Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9038) Google Scholar). Upon incubation with drugs, cells were washed and suspended in 1% agarose (low melting point) in PBS. Then 75 μl of this mixture was pipetted onto a microscope slide that had been pre-coated with 75 μl of 1% agarose (normal melting point). Without delay, a glass coverslip was placed on top of the slide, and the agarose/cell mixture was allowed to congeal at 4 °C. Upon removal of the coverslip, the slides were immersed in ice-cold lysis solution (10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mNaCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 10% Me2SO, and 1% Triton X-100) for 1 h. Slides were then placed in an electrophoresis unit containing 0.3 m NaOH and 1 mm EDTA, pH 13, for 40 min before electrophoresis at 20 V (300 mA) for 20 min. Following electrophoresis, the slides were immersed in neutralizing buffer (0.4m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) before the DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for observation with fluorescence microscopy. We have previously shown that SFA inhibits IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation at the G1 phase of the cell cycle (22Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether SFA is specific for T lymphocyte, we examined several transformed cell lines. As shown in Fig.1, the human colon cancer cell line HCT 116 is sensitive to SFA. Like CTLL2, the cell cycle progression of HCT 116 is also blocked in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. To simplify subsequent studies of the cell cycle effect of SFA, we decided to use HCT 116 as a model system. We have shown that SFA blocks the appearance of growth factor-dependent cyclinE-Cdk2 activity, likely explaining the G1 effect of SFA (22Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This inhibition is not due to down-regulation of either CyclinE or Cdk2 proteins as determined by Western blot analysis (22Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When we examined the expression of the p21 family of CyclinE-Cdk2 inhibitor proteins, it was found that SFA treatment of HCT 116 cells led to a significant increase in the level of p21 protein expression (Fig. 2 A). When p21 mRNA was examined, it was also induced dramatically by SFA (Fig.3 A). As p21 transcription is known to be regulated by p53, we checked whether p53 expression is affected by SFA.Figure 3SFA induces p53 and p21 at the level of transcription. A, p53 and p21 mRNA levels in HCT116 cells were determined by RT-PCR after cells were treated with SFA at indicated concentrations for 3 h. B, HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with one of the following luciferase reporter constructs (1 μg): pG13.pyLuc, p53Luc (2.4 kilobase) or p53Luc (356 bp). Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. They were then incubated in the presence or absence of SFA for 12 h before they were harvested for the determination of luciferase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We first examined the effect of SFA on p53 at the protein level. Indeed, p53 protein is significantly induced by SFA (Fig.2 A). Given that p53 is known to be regulated at multiple levels, including protein stability and mRNA synthesis, we determined whether SFA stabilized p53 protein. We treated HCT 116 cells with SFA for 3 h to induce p53. Cycloheximide was then added into the cell culture to block de novo protein synthesis for an addition 1–8 h. The SFA-induced p53 was degraded over time upon treatment with cycloheximide even in the continued presence of SFA (Fig. 2 B). This result clearly indicated that the increase in p53 in the presence of SFA is not due to stabilization of p53 protein. When p53 mRNA synthesis was examined by RT-PCR, it was found to be significantly induced by SFA (Fig. 3 A), indicating that SFA activates p53 primarily at the mRNA level either by induction of its transcription or by stabilization of its mRNA or both. To determine whether SFA affected p53 transcription, we examined its effect on a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the p53 promoter. Indeed, SFA activated the p53-luciferase reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). As a control, we included a p21 reporter, pG13py.luc, which was activated by SFA as expected. In addition to the full-length p53 reporter gene, we also examined another reporter gene containing a 356-bp fragment of the p53 promoter with several important transcription factor binding sites responsive to DNA-damaging agents (29Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 30Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35240-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similar to the full-length p53 reporter, the minimal p53 reporter, p53Luc (356 bp), is induced by SFA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 B), suggesting that the most important SFA-responsive elements lie within this 356-bp fragment. Several transcription factor binding sites within this 356-bp fragment have been previously shown to be important for p53 transcription, including a HoxA5 and an NFκB binding site (29Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 32Wu H. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether either of the transcription factor binding sites is important for the activation of the p53 promoter by SFA, we mutated both sites and constructed the corresponding mutant reporter genes (Fig. 4 A). Mutation of the HoxA5 binding site had negligible effect on the response to SFA-mediated activation (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, mutation of the NFκB binding site completely abolished the response of the reporter gene to SFA. These data strongly suggest that the NFκB binding element in the p53 promoter is essential for the activation of p53 transcription by SFA. The signal transduction pathways leading to NFκB activation have been largely elucidated. A number of stimuli have been shown to converge on the upstream kinases, IKKs, to activate NFκB. The IKKs phosphorylate the cytoplasmic-anchoring protein IκB, which leads to the degradation of IκB and nuclear translocation of NFκB. To determine which step in the upstream NFκB activation pathway SFA affects, we repeated the p53 reporter gene assay in the presence of a dominant negative IKKα and a mutant IκBα that is incapable of being phosphorylated by IKKs. We thus cotransfected HCT 116 cells with the p53Luc reporter gene along with the dominant negative IKKα (dnIKKα) and the mutant IκBα (mIκBα) and examined the activation of the p53Luc reporter gene by SFA. Both mIκBα and dnIKKα abolished the activation of the p53Luc reporter by SFA, suggesting that SFA activated NFκB at a step upstream of IKKs (Fig. 4 C). To confirm that SFA is capable of activating NFκB, we examined the effect of SFA on an NFκB luciferase reporter gene comprising of multimerized NFκB binding sites. SFA stimulated the NFκB reporter by about 4-fold, consistent with its stimulation of the p53Luc reporter (Fig. 5 A). Like the activation of the p53Luc reporter gene, the activation of the NFκB reporter gene by SFA is also inhibited by both dominant negative IKKα and the mutant form of IκBα (Fig. 5 A). We next determined whether SFA induced IκB degradation and IKK activation. Of the two isoforms of IκB examined, SFA induced IκBα degradation in a dose-dependent manner, while IκBβ appeared to be less responsive, with appreciable degradation observed only at the highest dosage of SFA used (Fig. 5 B). When we checked the IKK activity by immunoprecipitation-kinase assay, SFA was found to activate IKK activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 C). At the highest dose used, SFA induced a similar amount of IKK activity as 20 ng/ml of TNFα. It can thus be concluded that SFA activates NFκB at a step upstream of IKK. We have shown that SFA induces p53 transcription, which appeared to be sufficient to cause cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase through the induction of p21. It is not clear, however, whether p53 is in fact necessary for the cell cycle blockade caused by SFA. To address this question, we took advantage of the availability of MEFs that are deficient in p53. Similar to T cells and HCT 116 cells, the proliferation of wild type MEFs is sensitive to SFA (Fig. 6). In contrast,p53 −/− MEFs exhibited significant resistance to SFA. It is noteworthy, however, that the resistance of p53 null MEFs to SFA is not complete, indicating that there exist proteins that play a redundant role with p53. The ability of SFA to activate p53 via the NFκB signaling pathway is reminiscent of several cytotoxic drugs or carcinogens that act by causing DNA damage (31Pei X.H. Nakanishi Y. Takayama K. Bai F. Hara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35240-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Hellin A.C. Calmant P. Gielen J. Bours V. Merville M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For example, it has been previously reported that the anticancer drug daunomycin exhibited similar effects on cells through activation of NFκB and p53 (33Hellin A.C. Calmant P. Gielen J. Bours V. Merville M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have extended those observations by demonstrating that activation of p53 and NFκB reporter genes by the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin is sensitive to inhibition by both dominant negative IKKα and mutant IκBα, similar to SFA (Figs. 4 C and 5 A). These observations raised the possibility that SFA may manifest its cell cycle effect through DNA damage. To test this possibility, we turned to the so-called Comet assay that allows for quantitative determination of DNA damage at individual cell level (27Ostling O. Johanson K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 28Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9038) Google Scholar). As expected, doxorubicin caused extensive DNA damage to HCT 116 cells (Fig.7). However, SFA had little effect on the integrity of chromosomal DNA at concentrations that are sufficient to cause cell cycle arrest. These results clearly distinguish SFA from other known cytotoxic DNA damaging drugs and indicate that SFA is a unique agent that interacts with immunophilins on the one hand and activates NFκB and p53 on the other without causing DNA damage. SFA was discovered as a novel immunosuppressive agent (19Sanglier J.J. Quesniaux V. Fehr T. Hofmann H. Mahnke M. Memmert K. Schuler W. Zenke G. Gschwind L. Maurer C. Schilling W. J. Antibiot.

It was recently shown that SFA blocks IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, similar to the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (21Zenke G. Strittmatter U. Fuchs S. Quesniaux V.F.J. Brinkmann V. Schuler W. Zurini M. Enz A. Billich A. Sanglier J.J. Fehr T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7165-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J.

In this study, we found that the cell cycle effect of SFA is not confined to lymphocytes; it is equally effective at inhibiting the proliferation of several cancer cell lines, including HCT 116. Using HCT 116 as a model system, we have uncovered a pathway that appears to mediate the cell cycle effect of SFA. This pathway includes the IκB kinases that phosphorylate IκB, leading to activation of NFκB. The activated NFκB then induces the transcriptional activation of p53, which in turn activates the transcription of p21. The signaling cascade from IκB kinase activation to p21 expression accounts for the inhibition of the critical G1 kinase CyclinE-Cdk2 (22Zhang L.H. Liu J.O. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5611-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These findings shed new light on the mechanism of action of SFA and further distinguish SFA from rapamycin or CsA in their modes of action. As a cellular gate keeper for growth and division, p53 plays an essential role in sensing various stress signals and serves as a focal point of signal integration to decide whether cells will undergo growth arrest or apoptosis (35Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6733) Google Scholar, 36Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 37Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5808) Google Scholar). A multitude of stress signals are known to activate p53, including ionizing irradiation, UV, hypoxia, nucleotide deprivation, and chemotherapeutic agents. While most chemotherapeutic drugs are known to activate p53 through DNA damage, other small molecules capable of activating p53 have been reported. Among those is the fumagillin family of angiogenesis inhibitors that block endothelial cell cycle progression by activating p53 (38Zhang Y. Griffith E.C. Sage J. Jacks T. Liu J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 39Yeh J.R. Mohan R. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12782-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The ability of SFA to induce p53 in a variety of cells suggests that it may have potential as an inhibitor of angiogenesis in addition to its immunosuppressive activity. We have shown that SFA is capable of activating p53 transcription, though it remains to be determined whether SFA also affects the stability of p53 mRNA. Several transcription factors have been identified that appear to play a role in the activation of the p53 promoter, among which are NFκB and HoxA5 (29Raman V. Martensen S.A. Reisman D. Evron E. Odenwald W.F. Jaffee E. Marks J. Sukumar S. Nature. 2000; 405: 974-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 32Wu H. Lozano G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20067-20074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of these two transcription factors, NFκB has been shown to mediate the transcriptional activation of p53 in response to DNA damage, though the extent to which NFκB contribute to p53 transcription has remained somewhat controversial (30Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 33Hellin A.C. Calmant P. Gielen J. Bours V. Merville M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It was reported that an NFκB-binding element overlaps with a minimal p53 promoter that responds to chemotherapeutic agents (30Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). But NFκB was reported to play an insignificant role in the activation of p53, as evidenced by the lack of activation of a p53 reporter by expressed p65 and the lack of effect by N-acetyl cysteine on genotoxic stress-induced p53 activation. In contrast, both benzo[a]pyrene, a carcinogen, and daunomycin, an anticancer drug, have been shown to induce p53 transcription via activation of NFκB (31Pei X.H. Nakanishi Y. Takayama K. Bai F. Hara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35240-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Hellin A.C. Calmant P. Gielen J. Bours V. Merville M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our observations that mutation of the NFκB site within the p53 promoter led to complete abrogation of reporter gene activation by SFA and that dominant negative form of IKKα and mutant IκBα inhibited activation of p53 reporter gene corroborate with the conclusion that NFκB can play an essential role in the transcriptional activation by certain reagents. Although activation of p53 seems sufficient for the SFA-mediated cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, it is not absolutely necessary (Fig. 6). When MEFs deficient in p53 were tested for their sensitivity to SFA, they were much less sensitive to SFA than wild type MEFs (Fig. 6), suggesting that p53 is indeed involved in the action of SFA. Interestingly, the resistance to SFA upon p53deletion is incomplete; their proliferation can still be inhibited by high doses of SFA (Fig. 6). It is likely that redundant proteins exist that can compensate for the lack of p53. It will be interesting to test whether the recently discovered p53 homologs, p63 and p73, may play such a role. A number of genotoxic agents, be they anticancer drugs or carcinogens, have been shown to be capable of activating p53. And NFκB has been shown to be important for the activation of p53transcription by several agents (31Pei X.H. Nakanishi Y. Takayama K. Bai F. Hara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35240-35246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 33Hellin A.C. Calmant P. Gielen J. Bours V. Merville M.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine whether SFA is also a genotoxic agent, we determined the ability of SFA to cause DNA damage. Using the Comet assay, we have unambiguously shown that SFA, in contrast to doxorubicin, has no effect on the integrity of genomic DNA, distinguishing SFA from other genotoxic agents. Using dominant negative IKKα, we were able to block SFA-stimulated p53 luciferase reporter (Fig. 4 C) as well as NFκB luciferase reporter (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that SFA acts upstream of IKK to activate the NFκB. Indeed, SFA was found to be capable of activating IKK like TNFα (Fig. 5 C). The precise mechanism of activation of IKK by SFA will have to await the identification of the direct molecular target of SFA, which may unravel an entry point for pharmacological activation of the NFκB pathway and p53.

It causes misfolding of the proteins into which it is incorporated competitively with l-proline and thereby inhibits the growth of the cells. We recently have discovered, on the chromosome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Σ1278b, a novel gene MPR1 required for the resistance of Σ1278 background strains to toxic AZC. This gene was missing in the particular yeast strain used for the genomic sequence determination. Although the protein sequence was homologous to that of the S. cerevisiae transcriptional regulator, Mpr1p did not affect the expression of genes involved in proline uptake. However, gene expression in Escherichia coli and enzymatic analysis showed that the MPR1 gene encodes a novel AZC acetyltransferase, by which l-proline itself and otherl-proline analogues are not acetylated. Mpr1p was considered to be a member of the N-acetyltransferase superfamily based on the results of an Ala-scan mutagenesis through the highly conserved region involved in binding acetyl-CoA in members of the superfamily. Our findings suggest that Mpr1p detoxifies AZC by acetylating it in the cytoplasm. This enzyme might be utilized as a selective marker in a wide variety of organisms, because the cells expressing the MPR1 gene acquire the AZC-resistant phenotype. l-Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC), a toxic four-membered ring analogue ofl-proline, is transported into the cells via proline transporters.

The addition of certain amino acid analogues or mild heat shock causes a rapid increase in the synthesis of heat shock proteins in cells. The elevated levels of synthesis for this set of proteins begins to decrease shortly after restoration of the normal amino acids or normal temperature. Therefore, amino acid analogues have proved to be valuable reagents for studying cellular metabolism and the regulation of synthesis of macromolecules in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (1Kelley P.M.

A toxic four-membered ring analogue of l-proline,l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC)1, is incorporated into proteins competitively with l-proline and causes the synthesis of abnormal misfolded proteins, thereby inhibiting cell growth in both bacterial and animal cells (4Mizzen L.A.

In bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens,l-proline biosynthesis from l-glutamate is regulated mainly through feedback inhibition by l-proline of γ-glutamyl kinase, a key enzyme in the pathway (8Smith C.J. Deutch A.H. Rushlow K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 545-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Omori K. Suzuki S. Imai Y. Komatsubara S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because this enzyme is also feedback-inhibited by l-proline analogues such as AZC, l-proline-overproducing strains have been successfully isolated froml-proline-analogue-resistant mutants, which have a mutation in the proB gene coding for γ-glutamyl kinase that causes desensitization to feedback inhibition (10Sugiura M. Takagi T. Kisumi M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1985; 21: 213-219Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 11Omori K. Suzuki S. Imai Y. Komatsubara S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate the cryoprotective effect of l-proline on the freezing stress of yeast, we previously isolated AZC-resistant mutants from an l-proline-nonutilizing strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Takagi H. Iwamoto F. Nakamori S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 47: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the process of this study, it was noteworthy that S. cerevisiae strain Σ1278b showed greater AZC resistance than that of other laboratory strains, including the genome project strain S288C. The strain Σ1278b, mainly used in European laboratories, is known to have unique genetic features for nitrogen metabolism and morphological characteristics for diploid pseudohyphal development and haploid invasive growth (13Grenson M. Hou C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Wiame J.-M. Grenson M. Arst H.N., J. Adv. Bicrobiol.

We recently isolated novel genes involved in AZC resistance from the genomic library of strain Σ1278b (16Takagi H. Shichiri M. Takemura M. Mohri M. Nakamori S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4249-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the novel genes MPR1 and MPR2 (sigma 1278b gene forl-proline-analogue resistance) required for AZC resistance were present on chromosomes XIV and X of strain Σ1278b, respectively, but were absent in other laboratory strains (S288C etc.). The primary structure of the predicted Mpr proteins was found to be a member of the N-acetyltransferase (NAT) superfamily (17Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), although one amino acid change at position 85 occurred between the MPR1 and MPR2 genes. Both MPR genes are expressed in other S. cerevisiaestrains, where they play global roles in AZC resistance (16Takagi H. Shichiri M. Takemura M. Mohri M. Nakamori S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4249-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous reports have described only a point mutation or a deletion of a few bases, based on comparisons of certain genes between Σ1278b and S288C strains (18Liu H. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1996; 144: 967-978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bonhivers M. Carbrey J.M. Gould S.J. Agre P. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, ours is the first report of novel genes present in strain Σ1278b and absent in other laboratory strains. However, the detailed function of the MPR genes in AZC resistance has been unclear. Thus, in the present study, we analyzed the function of the MPR1 gene required for AZC resistance in S. cerevisiae and E. coli. We show here by Ala-scan mutagenesis that the MPR1 gene encodes a novel AZC acetyltransferase and that Mpr1p belongs to a superfamily of NAT. In addition, a possible mechanism for AZC resistance by Mpr1p in vivo will be discussed. The S. cerevisiae strains with a Σ1278b background used in this study were L5685 (MATa ura3–52 trp1 MPR1 MPR2) (supplied by G. Fink) and LD1014 (MATa ura3–52 trp1 mpr1::URA3 mpr2::TRP1). For MPR1 and MPR2genes disruption, the 3.3-kb SacI-SacI fragment containing mpr1::URA3 and the 3.7-kb SacI-SacI fragment containing mpr1::TRP1 were integrated into the MPR1 and MPR2 locus in strain L5685 by transformation (16Takagi H. Shichiri M. Takemura M. Mohri M. Nakamori S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4249-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Strains CKY2 (MATa ura3–52 his4–619) with a S288C background (supplied by C. Kaiser) was also used in this study. Plasmids pMH1 (16Takagi H. Shichiri M. Takemura M. Mohri M. Nakamori S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4249-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and pMPR-BM, both of which contain the MPR1 gene inserted into a yeast multicopy plasmid pYES2 (Invitrogen), were used to express the MPR1 gene in S. cerevisiae strain S288C. A centromere plasmid pRS416 (Stratagene) harboring URA3 gene was used for construction of chimeric gene encoding Mpr1p and green fluorescent protein (GFP). An E. coli strain JM109 (recA1Δ(lac-proAB) endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 relA1 supE44/(F′ traD36 proAB + lacI q ZΔM15)) and the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible vector pQE30 (Qiagen) with the sequence coding six consecutive histidine residues at the 5′ end of cloning sites were used for the expression of the MPR1 gene in E. coli. The media used for growth of S. cerevisiae were SD (2% glucose, 0.67% Bacto yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco Laboratories)) and YPD (2% glucose, 1% Bacto yeast extract, 1% Bacto peptone). SD medium contains ammonium sulfate (0.1%) as the nitrogen source. To examine the MPR1 gene function, 0.1% proline was used instead of ammonium sulfate as the sole source of nitrogen. When appropriate, required amino acids were added to the media for auxotrophic strains. Yeast strains were also cultured on SD agar plates containingl-proline analogue, AZC, 3,4-dehydro-dl-proline (DHP), or l-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TAC). All the analogues were obtained from Sigma. The E. coli recombinant cells were grown in M9 medium (21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) containing 2% casamino acids and 50 μg/ml ampicillin (M9CA). If necessary, 2% agar was added to solidify the medium. Plasmid pRSMPR was first constructed by subcloning of the 3.7-kb SacI-SacI fragment containing the MPR1 gene from pMH1 into the SacI site of pRS416. The 750-bp XhoI-AatII fragment containing a mutated Aequorea GFP gene from pGreenscript A (22Inouye S. Ogawa H. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Tsuji F.I. Gene. 1997; 189: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was then ligated into the NcoI site 3 bp upstream of the termination codon in the MPR1 gene of pRSMPR by blunt-end ligation. The plasmid in which the GFP gene was fused to the carboxyl terminus of Mpr1p in the sense orientation was designated as pMPRGFP. The S. cerevisiae CKY2 was transformed by pMPRGFP, and the Ura+ and AZC-resistant transformants were visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscopy (INSIGHT PLUS; Meridian Instruments). The enzymes used for DNA manipulations were obtained from Takara Shuzo. To introduce the NcoI sites on the amino terminus and carboxyl termini, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out with pMH1 as a template and primers 5′-AGCCATGGATGCGGAATC-3′ and 5′-GTCCATGGTTATTCCAT TGAGAGGA-3′ (the underlined sequence is the position of a NcoI site). The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI, and the ends were filled with T4 DNA polymerase. The blunt-ended DNA was ligated into the SmaI site of pQE30. The plasmid in which the MPR1 gene was placed under the T5 promoter/lac operator in the sense orientation was designated as pQE-MPR. The pQE-MPR carries the entire MPR1 gene with the sequence coding six consecutive histidine residues and nine additional amino acid residues (Gly-Ser-Ala-Cys-Glu-Leu-Gly-Thr-Pro) at the amino terminus. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed with a Model 377 DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems). The E. coli strain JM109 was transformed with pQE-MPR, and the recombinant cells were grown at 37 °C in M9CA medium. When absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5, IPTG was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce gene expression. After cultivation for 4 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell-free extracts were prepared by sonic oscillation under cooling. The His-tagged fusion proteins in the soluble fraction were then purified using the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose supplied by Qiagen. The replacements of Arg145, Gly146, Gln147, Lys148, Val149, and Gly150 by Ala and of Lys148 by Gly in Mpr1p were performed by PCR with oligonucleotide primers R145A+ (5′-GTGCCCATG*C*T*GGTCAGAA-3′), R145A− (5′-TTCTGACCA*G*C*ATGGGCAC-3′), G146A+ (5′-CCCATAGAGC*TCAGAAGCTT-3′), G146A− (5′-AACCTTCTGAG*CTCTATGGG-3′), Q147A+ (5′-ATAGAGGTG*C*T*AAG GTTGGCTAC-3′), Q147A− (5′-GTAGCCAACCTTA*G*C*ACCTCTAT-3′), K148A+ (5′-GAGGTCAGG*C*T*GTTGGCTA-3′), K148A− (5′-TAGCCAACA*G*C*CTGACCTC-3′), V149A+ (5′-GTCAGAAGGC*TGGCTAC-3′), V149A− (5′-GTAGCCAG*CCTTCTGAC-3′), G150A+ (5′-AGAAGGTTGC*T*TACAGGCTTG-3′), G150A− (5′-CAAGCCTGTA A*G*CAACCTTCT-3′), K148G+ (5′-AGGTCAGG*G*T*GTTGGCTAC-3′), and K148G− (5′-GTAGCCAACA*C*C*CTGACCT-3′), respectively, using a Gene Amp PCR system 2400 (PE Biosystems). The asterisks show the locations of mismatches. A plasmid pMPR-BM was constructed by ligating the 1.6-kb BglII-MluI fragment containing the MPR1 gene from pMH1 to the large fragment of pYES2 digested with BamHI and MluI and used as a template DNA for site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, primers 5′-CACAG TTTGACAAAACAGGG-3′ and 5′-CGACGCGTCGTTATTCGTTC-3′ were synthesized to complement regions upstream and downstream of the EcoRI restriction sites in pMPR-BM. The unique amplified band of 630 bp was digested with EcoRI to recover the 340-bp fragment and ligated to a 6.9-kb fragment of plasmid pMPR-BM digested with EcoRI. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Northern blot analysis was carried out using Gene Images random-prime labeling and detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from S. cerevisiaewas isolated by the method of Köhrer and Domdey (23Köhrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). RNA was separated in 1.0% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane. As a DNA probe, the DNA fragments of the GAP1, PUT4,MPR1, and ACT1 genes were prepared by PCR with oligonucleotide primers GAP1+ (5′-TTGACGAAACAGGTTCAGGG-3′), GAP1− (5′-TGCT GGGATGAAAAGCTTCC-3′), PUT4+ (5′-GATTATGGACGTGGACTTGG-3′), PUT4− (5′-AATGAGAGAGAACCACACGG-3′), MPR1+ (5′-GCTCGAGAAGCTTCGAATGC-3′), MPR1− (5′-TCAAAATTCCGGCATGAGGC-3′), ACT1+ (5′-CGGAATTCCTCTCCCATAA CCTCCTA-3′), and ACT1− (5′-CGGGATCCGGGCTCTGAATCTTTCGT-3′), respectively. Each unique amplified band was purified from agarose gel, denatured, and labeled according to the protocol recommended by the supplier. Total cellular proteins from extracts of S. cerevisiae and E. coli were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. To determine whether Mpr1p contains an asparagine-linked carbohydrate, the S. cerevisiae extracts expressing the MPR1 gene were also digested with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) under conditions recommended by the supplier. The wild-type and mutant proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using the Phototope-Star detection kit (New England Biolabs) and anti-Mpr1p polyclonal antibody prepared from the recombinant His-tagged Mpr1p overproduced in E. coli. To determine acetyltransferase activities, the whole-cell extracts of S. cerevisiae and E. coli strains expressing the MPR1 gene were prepared by vortexing the cells with glass beads and by sonic oscillation under cooling, respectively, and used as enzyme sources. The acetyltransferase activity was assayed at 30 °C by monitoring the increase of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) because of the reaction of acetyl-CoA with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) described previously with some modifications (24Kredich N.M. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4955-4965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial rate of the increase in absorbance at 412 nm of the reaction mixture (final volume, 1 ml) containing 50 mm acetate ammonium (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mml-proline, AZC, DHP, or TAC, 1 mm DTNB, 0.1 mmacetyl-CoA (Wako Pure Chemical) and enzyme solution was measured, and that obtained for a solution containing all the materials exceptl-proline, AZC, DHP, or TAC (blank) was subtracted. The reaction rate was calculated using an extinction coefficient for TNB of 15,570 m−1 cm−1. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol TNB/min at 30 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard protein. The amount of AZC in the reaction mixture was quantified with an amino acid analyzer (L-8500A; Hitachi). The GenBankTM accession numbers for Mpr1p, Spt10p, Hat1p, Mak3p, spermidine N-acetyltransferase, and puromycin N-acetyltransferase are AB031349, L24435, U33335, M95912,D25276, and M25346, respectively. The MPR1mRNA was identified by RNA hybridization analysis of total yeast RNA as a single 1.0-kb transcript in the strains L5685 and CKY2 (pMH1) in proportion to the copy number of the MPR1 gene (data not shown). Bands corresponding to the molecular mass of Mpr1p (∼26 kDa) were also detected in the same strains expressing the MPR1gene by Western blotting using an anti-Mpr1p polyclonal antibody (data not shown). Mpr1p was shown to be a nonglycoprotein, based on the finding that the apparent molecular mass after digestion with endoglycosidase H was similar to that of the untreated protein (data not shown), consistent with the fact that the Mpr1p sequence lacks consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation. The Mpr1p sequence of 229 amino acid residues was found to be homologous only to the amino-terminal sequence of the S. cerevisiae SPT10 (SUD1)-encoded protein with 640 amino acids, a negative transcriptional regulator (25Yamashita I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Natsoulis G. Winston F. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse G. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5223-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Bothl-proline and AZC are transported into the yeast cells via two transporters, the general amino acid permease (encoded by GAP1) and the proline-specific permease (encoded by PUT4) (28Stanbrough M. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 94-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the MPR1 gene functions as an Spt10p-like transcriptional regulator, based on the hypothesis that Mpr1p represses GAP1and PUT4 genes, leading to the AZC-resistant phenotype. Northern blot analysis showed quantitatively similar amounts of GAP1 and PUT4 transcripts in the strains L5685, LD1014, CKY2 (pMH1), and CKY2 (pYES2) in the presence or absence of AZC (data not shown). Also, when the above yeast strains were grown on a minimal agar medium containing l-proline as the sole nitrogen source, the growth did not vary from that observed with ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source, suggesting that the proline permeases function normally even in the presence of the MPR1gene (data not shown). Further, Mpr1p did not include any amino acid sequences that are similar to the DNA binding motifs and the amino-terminal basic domains found in other yeast transcriptional factors (26Natsoulis G. Winston F. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse G. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5223-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A preliminary experiment showed that Mpr1-GFP fusion protein stayed primarily in the cytoplasm and did not localize in the nucleus (data not shown). These findings indicate that Mpr1p involved in AZC resistance is not a transcriptional regulator, which does not repress the yeast proline permease genes GAP1 and PUT4. To further analyze the function of the MPR1 gene, various S. cerevisiae strains were cultured on SD agar plates containing each of three toxicl-proline analogues (AZC, DHP, and TAC) (Fig. 1). The MPR1 gene was shown to confer only a four-membered ring analogue-AZC resistance to the yeast cells, not a five-membered ring DHP and TAC. Therefore, Mpr1p is supposed to work on AZC directly, and bacterial cells such as E. coli, which are naturally AZC-sensitive, would therefore become resistant to AZC when the MPR1 gene is successfully expressed in the cells. In addition, it is worth noting that the strain with the Σ1278b background, regardless of the MPR genes, was less sensitive to DHP and TAC relative to the strain with the S288C background. Based on the hypothesis described above, we constructed an expression plasmid pQE-MPR for the MPR1 gene under the IPTG-inducible promoter. Surprisingly, the E. coli JM109 cells expressing the MPR1 gene in the presence of IPTG were capable of growing on agar plates containing AZC, thereby acquiring the AZC-resistant phenotype, whereas the vector-harboring cells failed to grow on AZC-containing plates (Fig. 2 A). Based on the finding that Mpr1p sequence was a member of the NAT superfamily, we examined the acetyltransferase activities for l-proline and various analogues (AZC, DHP, and TAC) in total cell extracts from the S. cerevisiae L5685, CKY2, and E. coli JM109 cells expressing the MPR1 gene (Fig. 2 B). Among the substrates used, only acetyltransferase activities of AZC were clearly detected in proportion to the level of gene expression. No measurable activities were observed from the cell extracts harboring the vector only and with the substrates of l-proline, DHP, or TAC having a five-membered ring structure (data not shown). These results showed that the MPR1 gene encodes an AZC acetyltransferase that does not acetylate the five-membered ring compound l-proline, DHP, or TAC. The NAT superfamily, which includes over 50 members, has four conserved regional motifs, A–D (17Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In particular, the most highly conserved motif A would be involved in the binding of acetyl-CoA (29Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Strenglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F. Cell. 1999; 97: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and has a short consensus sequence, (Q/R)XXG X(G/A), in common with members of the superfamily (Fig. 3 A). Further, point mutations in any of these residues were found to impair the activities of NAT enzymes (31Kuo M.H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 32Smith E.R. Eisen A. Gu W. Sattah M. Pannuti A. Zhou J. Cook R.G. Lucchesi J.C. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3561-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the case of the Mpr1p sequence, the corresponding region consists of Arg145–Gly146–Gln147–Lys148–Val149–Gly150, with high degrees of similarity to other members, excepting position 148. To examine the function of Mpr1p as a member of the NAT superfamily, the six consecutive residues were individually changed to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting mutants were characterized in terms of AZC resistance and acetyltransferase activity. In addition to these mutations, Lys148 was changed to consensus Gly. All mutant genes were expressed using the original promoter and terminator of MPR1 to obtain normal levels of gene expression. The S. cerevisiae strain CKY2 with a S288C background was transformed with these plasmids, and the Ura+ transformants were cultivated in SD medium supplemented with His. The levels of MPR1 gene expression were almost the same for all mutants, based on densitometric estimates of the amounts of accumulated Mpr1p in the soluble fraction by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 4 C shows the growth phenotype on AZC-containing medium and the AZC acetyltransferase activities of strains having various mutant Mpr1 proteins. The enzymes in the whole-cell extracts were assayed without further purification. The Ala substitution of the highly conserved residues Arg145, Val149, and Gly150 led to a growth defect in AZC and simultaneously resulted in the complete loss of AZC acetyltransferase activity. These residues in Mpr1p that corresponded to the consensus sequence of the NAT superfamily were found to be necessary for activity. On the other hand, G146A and Q147A mutants displaying AZC resistance in the growth assay also retained a significant level of activity for AZC acetylation. These residues are unlikely to be crucial for the function of Mpr1p. It was also shown that Gly or Ala substitution at position 148 had no influence on this activity. This is probably explained by the fact that Lys or Arg naturally occupies this position in some NAT members (17Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). AZC resistance and acetylation activity in the strains producing the various Mpr1 proteins correlated with each other. These results strongly suggest that Mpr1p is a novel member of the NAT superfamily.Figure 4Mpr1p is supposed to be an AZC N-acetyltransferase. A, time course of AZC concentration in the reaction mixture. The enzymatic reaction was performed as described under “Results.” Purified His-tagged fusion Mpr1p (closed circles) and the soluble proteins from the E. coli cells carrying vector pQE30 (open circles) were used as the enzyme sources. AZC content at the indicated time was quantified with an amino acid analyzer.B, proposed scheme for the AZC acetyltransferase reaction. AZC is converted to N-acetyl AZC by Mpr1p.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The His-tagged fusion Mpr1p was purified from the recombinant E. coli cells expressing the MPR1 gene as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A 2-ml reaction mixture containing 100 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm AZC (1 mg), 50 mm acetyl-CoA, and 15 milliunits of the recombinant enzyme was incubated at 30 °C. The gradual decrease in AZC in the reaction mixture was observed with the time of incubation, whereas the initial content of AZC still remained under this condition without the enzyme (Fig. 4 A). However, no new peak corresponding to acetylated AZC appeared, possibly because the ninhydrin reagent used for amino group detection did not bind to acetylated AZC. Based on these findings and the amino acid sequence similarity with the NAT superfamily, we now believe that AZC is converted to N-acetyl AZC by Mpr1p in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 B), and consequently, N-acetyl AZC no longer replacedl-proline during the biosynthesis of protein. In general, unusual imino acid AZC is incorporated into the nascent polypeptide chain by competition with l-proline in the formation of AZC-tRNA, given rise to by virtue of its structural similarity to l-proline. Stereochemical considerations suggest that AZC in the protein will change the normal α-helical structure of a polypeptide to one having an angle about 15° smaller than that by l-proline, leading to an altered tertiary structure of the protein (5Fowden L. Richmond M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 71: 459-461Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, AZC shows growth-inhibitory and toxic activities in a wide variety of cells (4Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 5Fowden L. Richmond M.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Yanagi H. Yura T. Kubota H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that AZC is widely distributed in many plants belonging to the Lilaceae family (33Leete E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 3162Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Peterson P.J. Fowden L. Nature. 1963; 200: 148-151Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which includes Convallaria majalis (lily of the valley) and Polygonatum multiflorum (a Solomon’s seal), at high concentrations. Although the physiological role of AZC in Lilaceae plants is not clear, AZC is supposed to protect them from attack by vertebrates and/or microbes. Some plant species that produce AZC were found to havel-proline-activating enzymes that differentiate betweenl-proline and AZC (34Peterson P.J. Fowden L. Nature. 1963; 200: 148-151Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is speculated that onlyl-prolyl-tRNA is then formed so that l-proline alone is incorporated into proteins. In recent studies on the biosynthesis of AZC, labeled l-methionine was incorporated into AZC in lily of the valley plants (35Leete E. Louters L.L. Rao H. Prakash S. Phytochemistry. 1986; 25: 2753-2758Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the result of which was in agreement with the earlier hypothesis by Leete (33Leete E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 3162Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that AZC is formed by the intramolecular displacement of thiomethyladenosine by the α-amino group of S-adenosylmethionine. In contrast, little is known about its metabolic pathway in plants. Mpr1p was found be a novel acetyltransferase with high substrate specificity for AZC. It is unlikely that this enzyme is responsible for AZC degradation, because the yeast cells expressing the MPR1gene were unable to grow in media containing AZC as the sole nitrogen source (data not shown). Our findings suggested that N-acetylation of AZC is catalyzed by Mpr1p in the cytoplasm, which presumably transfers acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to α-imino groups of AZC. It can be assumed that N-acetyl AZC is no longer recognized by l-prolyl-tRNA synthetase by which bothl-proline and AZC bind to ATP, thereby onlyl-proline is incorporated into proteins, leading to cell growth even in the presence of AZC. The structural determination of N-acetyl AZC is needed to prove this hypothesis and is currently in progress. The question arises as to why the S. cerevisiae strain Σ1278b possesses the MPR genes, although a hypothetical protein with significant sequence similarity to Mpr1p was found in fission yeast (16Takagi H. Shichiri M. Takemura M. Mohri M. Nakamori S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4249-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We consider the following two possibilities for the physiological role of MPR genes. One is that the S. cerevisiae strain Σ1278b in nature made its habitat on the Lilaceae or in soils around these plants. To avoid the toxicity of AZC, the strain may have successfully acquired the MPR1 gene involved in AZC resistance from the Lilaceae or some unknown organism during the evolutionary process. It would be of interest to seek the common ancestor of the MPR1 gene to further understanding of the mechanism of AZC resistance. Therefore, this work might contribute to our understanding of the yeast in the natural habitat. Another possibility is that Mpr1p has a bona fide substrate(s) (i.e. not AZC) in the S. cerevisiae strain Σ1278b. To identify the natural substrate for Mpr1p, we are now analyzing the growth phenotype on media containing various carbon and nitrogen sources, and examining the intracellular contents of the metabolites and the genome-wide transcriptional response to AZC in the wild-type strain and the mpr1 mpr2 disruptant. Neuwald and Landsman (17Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) reported that proteins belonging to the NAT superfamily have been grouped by function as histone acetyltransferases, transcriptional regulators, protein acetyltransferases, metabolic enzymes, participants in detoxification and drug resistance, or precise function unknown. In particular, the functional significance of the highly conserved residues in motifs A and B, involved in the binding of acetyl-CoA, have been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments with many enzymes (29Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Strenglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 36Tercero J.C. Wickner R.B. J. Biol.

To further analyze the function of Mpr1p as a member of the NAT superfamily, we performed an Ala-scan mutagenesis through a six-amino acid sequence (residues 145–150) possibly involved in the binding of acetyl-CoA to Mpr1p. These data, shown in Fig. 4, demonstrated a clear correlation between residues within Mpr1p that are critical for the acetylation of AZC and residues that are absolutely required for AZC resistance. V149A and G150A mutations severely affected AZC acetyltransferase activity, suggesting that Ala substitutions at these positions may interfere with acetyl-CoA binding to Mpr1p. A more detailed sequence comparison among members of the superfamily revealed that branched-chain amino acids such as Ile, Leu, and Val mainly occupy position X, corresponding to Val149 (17Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the steric hindrance, occurring via the G150A mutation that introduces a side chain, leads to reduced AZC acetyltransferase activity in Mpr1p. In contrast, Ala could be replaced with Lys at position 148 in terms of AZC resistance and acetyltransferase activity, so the positive charge is not likely to be indispensable for these functions. Recently, the crystal or solution structures of several proteins belonging to the NAT superfamily were determined in a complex with acetyl-CoA (29Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Strenglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 30Hickman A.B. Namboodiri M.A.A. Klein D.C. Dyda F.

Nature. 1999; 400: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to a short consensus of residues (Q/R)XXG X(G/A) in motif A, it was also shown that other hydrophobic residues in motifs A and B also contribute to form an acetyl-CoA binding pocket and to bind acetyl-CoA, respectively (38Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Given that Mpr1p does not contain any carbohydrates (data not shown) and remains active in the E. coli cells, a crystallization of the recombinant protein overexpressed in E. coli is now attempted to determine the tertiary structure. In terms of medical applications, naturally occurring AZC was identified as an antimutagen against the spontaneous mutation of bacteria (39Minakata H. Komura H. Tamura S.Y. Ohfune Y. Nakanishi K. Kada T. Experientia (Basel). 1985; 41: 1622-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and was tested for its antitumor activity in tissue culture (40Klohs W.D. Steinkampf R.W. Wicha M.S. Mertus A.E. Tunac J.B. Leopold W.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1985; 75: 353-359PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, when the MPR1 gene is expressed in normal cells, the toxic AZC is expected to be an efficacious agent. The MPR1 gene may also be promising as a new positive selection marker that confers AZC resistance in a wide variety of organisms, because AZC is incorporated, in place of l-proline, into the newly synthesized proteins. Construction and availability of versatile vectors with the MPR1 gene for E. coli, yeast, and animal cells will be published elsewhere. We thank Drs. Gerald R. Fink and Chris A. Kaiser for providing yeast strains, Dr. Satoshi Inouye for the gift of plasmid pGreenscript A, and Drs. Masaru Wada and Masakazu Takahashi for helpful comments on this work."

The predominant mammalian enzyme initiating repair of AP sites is the Ape1 AP endonuclease (also called Apex or Hap1), which also facilitates DNA binding by several transcription factors (Ref1 activity). We found that expression of the APE1 gene was coordinated with the cell cycle in murine NIH3T3 cells: APE1 mRNA levels rose after the G1-S transition and peaked ∼4-fold higher in early to mid-S phase. The increased APE1 mRNA was the result of transcriptional activation rather than increased mRNA stability. Fusions of various APE1 promoter fragments to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAT reporter gene indicated that APE1 expression depends on two transcription factor Sp1 binding sites within the promoter region. Mutation of these sites or of two CCAAT elements within the APE1 promoter, in conjunction with protein binding studies, demonstrated their specific roles. The Sp1 site upstream of the transcription start, together with an adjacent CCAAT element, establishes a protein-DNA complex required for basal transcription of APE1. The Sp1 site downstream of the transcription start was required for the response to cell growth. Because Ape1 is a dual function enzyme, its cell cycle-dependent expression might affect both DNA repair and the activity of various transcription factors as a function of the cell cycle.

The major mammalian AP endonuclease, Ape1, has been characterized at the biochemical and molecular genetic level by several laboratories (7Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ape1 has a second activity as a redox factor (Ref-1) that acts as a reducing donor for oxidized transcription factors such as AP-1 and p53 to restore DNA binding (15Gaiddon C. Moorthy N.C. Prives C.

The Ref1 activity depends on a cysteine residue in the Ape1 N-terminal domain unrelated to non-mammalian AP endonucleases of this family; the AP endonuclease activity is located in the conserved C-terminal domain (17Walker L.J.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4410-4416PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, variations in APE1 expression can occur under different sets of conditions and contribute to cellular resistance to genotoxic damage (8Ramana C.V. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5061-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 24Walker L.J. Craig R.B. Harris A.L. Hickson I.D.

Here we investigated the relationship between the cell cycle and APE1 expression in murine fibroblasts and found that transcription peaks in early S phase. Because transcription factors E2F and Sp1 have been implicated as central mediators of transcriptional control during progression into S phase (29Adams P.D. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we examined their roles in cell cycle-dependent APE1 expression. We found that E2F had only a minor role; instead, Sp1 appeared to exert the main effect on cell-regulated expression of APE1 via a regulatory site downstream of the transcription start point. Murine NIH3T3 embryonic fibroblast cells (obtained from ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine serum (Hyclone) under 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C. For synchronization, cells were plated at 10% confluence in normal growth medium with 10% bovine serum overnight. The cultures were then shifted to starvation medium (0.5% bovine serum) for 48–60 h. To initiate synchronous growth, complete medium containing 10% bovine serum was added. To monitor the progression of cells through the cell cycle, DNA content was measured by flow cytometric analysis. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, and pelleted for 7 min at 500 × g. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, recentrifuged, and fixed in 70% (v/v) ice-cold ethanol for ≥ 30 min on ice. Immediately before analysis, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 7 min and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 1 μg/ml RNase A. The DNA content of the cell samples was measured in a FACStar Plus cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). Total RNA extraction was carried out using a commercially available kit (RNeasy, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Samples (15 μg) of total RNA were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% denaturing agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with a 450-bp SmaI-SalI mouse APE1 probe from pBSK-APE. β-Actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA were used as controls. The radioactive signal was measured using phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad GS-525 molecular image analyzer). Transfection of NIH3T3 cells and luciferase (LUC) assay were performed as described previously (30Marquis J.C. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3435-3440PubMed Google Scholar,31Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was determined by using FAST CAT Green (deoxy) kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Reporter plasmids were introduced into cells by the calcium phosphate method (31Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase expression vector pCMV-β-gal was cotransfected as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency. Luciferase and CAT activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activity in each transfection sample. All assays were performed at least three times in duplicate. For analyzing the APE1 promoter, plasmids in the pCAT-Basic vector (Promega) carrying the CAT reporter gene were constructed. The plasmids pCBM1, pCBM2, pCBM6, pCBM7, pCBM10, pCBM14, pCBM16, and pCBM18 were described previously (32Harrison L. Ascione A.G. Takiguchi Y. Wilson III, D.M. Chen D.J. Demple B. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, a new construct pCBM20 was generated by a DraIII-HindIII digestion of pCBM6 to remove a 121-bp fragment; after the generation of blunt ends with Klenow DNA polymerase, the plasmid was recircularized. Promoter constructs were also made in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) carrying the coding region for firefly luciferase. Plasmid pGL2-APE1 was constructed by insertion of the HindIII-NheI APE1 promoter fragment (including bp −1534 to +295) from pCBM12 (32Harrison L. Ascione A.G. Takiguchi Y. Wilson III, D.M. Chen D.J.

Mutation of the wild-type APE1 promoter to generate a series of mutant APE1-LUC constructs was carried out using a polymerase chain reaction-based method. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to generate the individual point mutations, indicated by underlining in Table I, in the upstream Sp1 (Sp1-1), CCAAT and downstream Sp1 (Sp1-2), and E2F recognition sequences.

Binding reactions were carried out in a volume of 15 μl by incubating 5 μg of cell-free nuclear protein extract (32Harrison L. Ascione A.G. Takiguchi Y. Wilson III, D.M. Chen D.J. Demple B. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of poly(dG-dC) in a buffer containing 20 mmHEPES·KOH, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 4% Ficoll, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation for 10 min on ice, end-labeled duplex oligonucleotides were added, and the incubation was continued at room temperature for 20 min. This was followed by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel at a constant voltage of 8 V/cm applied for 2 h at 4 °C and then autoradiography of the dried gel. For competition experiments, a 10- and 100-fold excess of unlabeled competitor DNA were incubated with the protein extract for 10 min before the labeled oligonucleotide probes were added. For supershift assays, polyclonal antibodies (1 μg in 0.5 μl) against Sp1 (PEP2, sc59; from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or CCAAT box-binding protein (sc61; also from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the binding buffer for 1 h on ice before addition of the labeled DNA probes. The expression of APE1 as a function of the cell cycle was determined in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. As determined using flow cytometry, confluent, nongrowing NIH3T3 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) were mainly composed of G0/G1phase cells (85%) and a small proportion of S phase cells (5%). By contrast, exponentially growing NIH3T3 cultures contained a high proportion (45%) of S phase cells. The steady-state levels of APE1 mRNA were monitored by Northern blot analysis and quantified using a phosphorimaging system. As shown in Fig. 1 A, APE1 mRNA was 3.6-fold higher in exponentially growing cells than in confluent cells, which suggests that APE1 gene expression is up-regulated during growth. A similar result was obtained with the mouse embryonic fibroblast line 10T1/2 cells (data not shown). To determine further whether APE1 gene expression is cell cycle-dependent, synchronized NIH3T3 cells were obtained by serum depletion and refeeding. Fig. 1 B shows that the cells passed through G1 and entered S phase ∼10 h after release from G0. S phase continued for ∼8 h, with the proportion of S phase cells peaking at 16 h. The cells entered G2around 22 h after release from G0. Total RNA was isolated from cells harvested at times corresponding to G0/G1 (0, 5 h), S (10, 14, 16, 18 h), and G2 phases (22 h). Northern blot analysis showed that the level of APE1 mRNA was relatively low in G0/G1 (0 and 5 h) and began to increase as the cells entered S phase (Fig. 1 A). The maximal level of APE1 mRNA (5.4-fold increased over G0) occurred at 16 h, and then APE1 mRNA decreased through the rest of S and G2 phases. These results indicate that the expression of the APE1 gene in mouse fibroblasts is cell cycle-dependent, possibly with a specific relation to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. The observed increase in the steady-state level of APE1 mRNA could be caused by at least two alternative mechanisms, either increased mRNA production by transcriptional activation or decreased mRNA degradation by mRNA stabilization. To address the possibility of transcriptional activation of APE1, we transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells a construct with the full-length (−1534 to +295 bp) mouse APE1 promoter fused to the LUC reporter gene (31Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, luciferase activity increased gradually, reached a peak at 20 h (5.8-fold relative to 0 h), and then slowly declined. Overall, the luciferase pattern mirrored well the cell cycle-related changes in APE1 mRNA levels, except that the mRNA was 3–4 h ahead of the luciferase activity. This difference may be the result of the time needed to synthesize luciferase protein. There was no cell cycle variation in the background level of luciferase expressed in cells that had been transfected with a promoterless LUC vector (Fig. 2). Therefore, the cell cycle-dependent changes in APE1 gene expression are caused substantially by changes in transcription. To determine whether changes in the stability of APE1mRNA might contribute to its variation during the cell cycle, synchronized cells at 0 h and 16 h were treated with the RNA polymerase inhibitor actinomycin D (6 μg/ml), and at various times thereafter, samples were collected to determine the level of APE1 mRNA by Northern blotting. The mRNA degradation rate was not significantly different between G0/G1 phase cells and S phase cells, with a half-life of 1.9 h in both (data not shown). These results suggest that possible changes in mRNA turnover do not account for the variation in APE1 mRNA during the cell cycle. Instead, transcriptional regulation appears to be responsible for most of the cyclic variation in APE1 expression in NIH3T3 cells. To define the promoter region(s) responsible for the growth-regulated expression of APE1, deletion analysis of the promoter was carried out. Nine deletions of the proximal APE1 promoter region were fused to a CAT reporter gene (32Harrison L. Ascione A.G. Takiguchi Y. Wilson III, D.M. Chen D.J. Demple B. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After transient transfection with these constructs, the cells were synchronized, and CAT activity was measured in growing (20 h) and growth-arrested (0 h) cells (Fig. 3). As successive deletions were introduced in the upstream sequence 1534 bp (pCBM14) to 65 bp (pCBM20) 5′ to the transcription start (32Harrison L. Ascione A.G. Takiguchi Y. Wilson III, D.M. Chen D.J. Demple B. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the S phase APE1 promoter strength remained nearly constant and was always 3–4-fold higher in S phase than in G1 phase cells (Fig. 3). This result was again consistent with the cell cycle-dependent variation in APE1 expression being transcriptional in origin. Removing an additional 48-bp fragment to generate pCBM18 caused a ∼2-fold reduction in APE1 promoter activity in both G1 and S phase cells, although the growth-associated response was still observed (Fig. 3). This observation indicated a loss of basal promoter strength. Four successive deletions from the 3′-side (pCBM10, 16, 7, and 8) from downstream with a fixed upstream end point at −309 bp were also tested. The S phase-dependent expression of APE1 was preserved in pCBM10 (end point at +183), but was lost specifically in pCBM16 (end point at +99), whereas the expression in nongrowing cells was preserved (Fig. 3). This pattern suggested a specific loss of growth-dependent response connected with the deletion of the +99 to +183 region. Further deletion toward (pCBM7) or into the transcription start site (pCBM8) compromised overall APE1 promoter activity (Fig. 3). These experiments provide solid evidence that the upstream region of the APE1promoter (−65 to−17) functions in basal transcription, whereas the downstream region (+99 to +183) is necessary for the growth-regulated response. To identify the important growth-regulated elements located in the two promoter regions, we next tested for functional transcription factor binding sites within these DNA segments. The upstream region (−65 to−17) contains one potential Sp1 binding site and a CCAAT box, whereas the downstream region (+99 to +183) has a second Sp1 site and an E2F consensus site. To examine the contribution of each element to APE1 promoter activity, a mutation approach was used. Several promoter constructs directing transcription of a LUC reporter gene were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis (for the locations of the mutated sites, see schematic in Fig. 4); the downstream elements were mutated individually in the E2F site to create E2Fm, in the Sp1-2 site to create Sp1-2m, or simultaneously in both to create E2F/Sp1-2m. Similarly, in the upstream region, individually mutated (Sp1-1m) and (CCAATm), and double-mutated (Sp1-1/CCAATm) promoters constructs were generated. These constructs were transiently transfected into synchronously cycling NIH3T3 cells, and the levels of LUC activity were measured. The results in Fig. 4 show that the reporters with either of the upstream sites mutated (in Sp1-1m and CCAATm) had reduced overall transcriptional activity in both G1 (0 h) and S phases (20 h) cells compared with the wild-type promoter, but both retained the growth-regulated response. Mutation of the CCAAT site impaired promoter activity somewhat more than mutating the Sp1-1 site, but the double mutation did not amplify this effect (Fig. 4). Thus, both the Sp1-1 and CCAAT sites are important basal promoter elements throughout the cell cycle, but they are not required for the growth-dependent regulation. Mutation of the downstream Sp1 site in Sp1-2m caused a significant decrease in APE1 promoter activity specifically in S phase cells, but the promoter strength in G1 phase cells was not impaired (Fig. 4). This pattern demonstrated that the Sp1-2 site is critical for the growth-regulated response. In contrast, transcription from the E2Fm construct was comparable with or only slightly less efficient than that of the wild-type promoter (Fig. 4). The activity of the double mutant construct E2F/Sp1-2m was comparable with that of the Sp1-2m construct. We next examined the interactions between DNA-binding factors and the promoter elements identified as described above. We performed EMSA using nuclear extracts from growth-arrested (0 h) and S phase (16 h) NIH3T3 cells. Labeled probes of equal length (39-mer) contained the sites of interest in either the wild-type or the mutated forms. As shown in Fig. 5, incubation of nuclear extracts with labeled probes containing the wild-type Sp1-1 site or the CCAAT box sites generated a DNA protein complex that could be competed by a 100-fold excess of either an unlabeled probe containing the SV40 early promoter Sp1 site (Fig. 5 A, lane 4) or an oligonucleotide with the APE1 downstream CCAAT site (Fig. 5 B, lane 4), respectively. This result confirmed the specificity of these complexes. This specificity was confirmed further by supershifting with antibodies against Sp1 (Fig. 5 A, lane 7) or CCAAT box-binding protein (Fig. 5 B, lane 7). Moreover, the Sp1-1 and CCAAT box-binding complexes each were competed by the other cold competitor (Fig. 5 A, lane 6, and Fig. 5 B,lane 6). Most importantly, both the Sp1-1 and CCAAT complexes were formed in approximately equal amounts with extracts from both growth-arrested and S phase cells (compare lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, these complexes do not appear to account for growth-dependent APE1 expression. The downstream site Sp1-2 formed an abundant complex with S phase cell extracts (Fig. 5 C, lane 3), whereas a relatively minor proportion of the probe interacted with factor(s) from growth-arrested cells (Fig. 5 C, lane 2). The Sp1-2 binding activity was similar in cycling cells at 14, 16, 18, and 20 h (data not shown). To verify the specificity of this complex, an Sp1-2 mutated probe was used. The mutation eliminated binding of the probe by S phase nuclear proteins (Fig. 5 C, lane 9). We also performed Sp1-2 competition experiments using an unlabeled Sp1-1 fragment (specific competitor, s, in Fig. 5 C, lanes 4 and 5) or an E2F fragment (nonspecific competitor, n, in Fig. 5 C,lanes 6 and 7); only the Sp1-1 oligonucleotide demonstrated significant competition. The nature of the Sp1-2-binding protein was assessed using Sp1-specific antibodies, which produced an EMSA supershift with S phase nuclear extract (labeled ss in Fig. 5 C, lane 10). These results demonstrated that transcription factor Sp1 interacts with a downstream site in the APE1 gene in a growth-dependent fashion. Two protein complexes were detected with S phase cell extracts and a probe containing the APE1 downstream E2F site (Fig. 5 D, lane 2). However, these complexes were not affected by either mutation of the E2F site (Fig. 5 D,lane 4) or a 100-fold excess of an unlabeled E2F competitor (Fig. 5 D, lane 3). The effectiveness of the competitor was demonstrated using an E2F-containing probe from the dihydrofolate reductase gene (E2Fdf) (31Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) as a positive control (Fig. 5 D, lanes 5 and 6). Antibodies against E2F1, 2, 3, 4, and DP1 proteins also failed to generate supershifted complexes with the APE1 E2F probe (data not shown). These data suggest that complexes observed with this probe were nonspecific. Unrepaired AP sites in the genome threaten cellular integrity, in that they block replication and are targets for mutagenesis (5Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 33Gentil A. Cabral-Neto J.B. Mariage-Samson R. Margot A. Imbach J.L. Rayner B. Sarasin A. J. Mol.

A central mechanism to counteract this threat may be the induction of DNA repair functions, as we have shown here for growth-regulated expression of the APE1 gene. The amount of APE1mRNA was tightly coordinated with the cell cycle: the message level began increasing at or before the onset of DNA synthesis and continued to rise to a maximum at ∼16 h, near the time when DNA synthesis was maximal in our experiments. The increase in the APE1mRNA level was effected transcriptionally, and the control in response to the cell cycle depended critically on an Sp1 site in the transcribed region of the APE1 gene. Increased APE1 expression as cells begin DNA replication may help ensure that the DNA template is free of mutagenic and blocking lesions during this critical time. In addition to the thousands of bases lost daily through spontaneous hydrolysis in each mammalian cell (4Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4341) Google Scholar), oxygen radicals and other metabolic by-products continuously form lesions that enter the base excision pathway through DNA glycosylases (35Lindahl T. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Oxygen radicals can also directly form various types of oxidized abasic sites that are substrates for Ape1 (36Xu Y.J.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Similar to LIM kinases, TESK1 can phosphorylate cofilin/ADF specifically at Ser-3 in vitro and in vivo (12Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions is induced after TESK1 overexpression (12Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, upstream signaling pathways regulating LIM kinases and TESK1 significantly differ; the kinase activities of LIM kinases are stimulated by Rho family small GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, through the actions of downstream protein kinases, ROCK, Rho-associated, coiled-coil-forming protein kinase, and p21-activated kinase (5Yang N.

Thus, phosphorylation of cofilin/ADF in living cells is regulated by at least two distinct types of protein kinases, LIM kinases and TESK1, of which TESK1 appears to have a role in integrin-mediated actin cytoskeletal reorganization. However, the mechanisms regulating the activity and subcellular localization of TESK1 remain to be elucidated. 14-3-3 proteins, originally named for their migration positions in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins from brain extracts, consist of several highly conserved proteins that form dimers (19Aitken A.

These proteins interact with diverse signaling proteins, such as Raf-1 kinase, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Cdc25 phosphatase, and an apoptosis-promoting protein BAD, and are implicated in a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis (19Aitken A.

As recent studies revealed that 14-3-3 proteins interact with the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1 and a focal adhesion protein p130CAS, the potential role of 14-3-3 proteins in regulating integrin-mediated cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and related signaling events had to be considered (22Han D.C.

We searched for proteins that interact with TESK1, using the yeast two-hybrid system, and we identified 14-3-3β, one of the members of a 14-3-3 protein family, as the TESK1-binding protein. 14-3-3β specifically interacts with TESK1 in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation of Ser-439 within the C-terminal region of TESK1. We also observed the effects of binding of 14-3-3β on the kinase activity and the subcellular localization of TESK1. Our findings suggest that 14-3-3β plays an important role in regulating the functions of TESK1 in integrin-mediated signaling pathways. Yeast two-hybrid screening and assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for the ProQuest two-hybrid system (Life Technologies, Inc.) (29Vidal M. Braun P. Chen E. Boeke J.D. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10321-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To screen proteins that interact with TESK1, yeast MaV203 cells were sequentially transformed with pDBLeu-TK1-1 plasmid coding for the C-terminal region of rat TESK1 (TK1-1, amino acids 288–626) fused in-frame to the DNA binding domain of GAL4, and then with a HeLa cell cDNA library constructed in pPC86 vector that codes for the activation domain of GAL4 (29Vidal M. Braun P. Chen E. Boeke J.D. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10321-10326Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To test for transformation frequency, a small portion of the transformation mixture was plated on the medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. For screening, transformants were plated on the synthetic medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole and then were incubated for 60 h at 30 °C. After replica cleaning, plates were further incubated for 3 days, and growing colonies were selected as primary positives and further tested in three reporter assays, using histidine and uracil prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity, as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual. pPC86 plasmids recovered from colonies positive in histidine prototrophy and either or both of uracil prototrophy and β-galactosidase activity were retransformed into MaV203 cells with either pDBLeu-TK1-1 or pDBLeu vector to assess specific protein interactions. Nucleotide sequences of the cDNA inserts in pPC86 plasmids were determined using 373A DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed using BLAST search. For binding assays, MaV203 cells were co-transformed with a pDBLeu plasmid encoding the deletion mutants of TESK1 or TESK2 fused in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain and a pPC86 plasmid encoding 14-3-3β protein fused in-frame with GAL4 activation domain. Transformants were streaked on the plate lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole and incubated as above. pDBLeu-TK1-1 was generated by inserting a PstI-EcoRI fragment of rat TESK1 cDNA (nucleotide (nt) residues 1994–3600) (7Toshima J. Ohashi K. Okano I. Nunoue K. Kishioka M. Kuma K. Miyata T. Hirai M. Baba T. Mizuno K. J. Biol.

Toshima J.Y. Takeuchi K. Mori R. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31449-31458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) into the NotI site of the pDBLeu vector. Expression plasmids coding for the N-terminally Myc epitope-tagged TESK1 and TESK1(D170A) mutant were constructed as described (12Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids coding for Myc-tagged, C-terminally truncated mutants of TESK1 (Δ1, Δ2, Δ3, and Δ4) were constructed by inserting anNcoI-EcoRI fragment (nt 1129–2705), anNcoI-EcoT14I fragment (nt 1129–2386), anNcoI-HincII fragment (nt 1129–2262), and anNcoI-EcoO109I fragment (nt 1129–2147) of rat TESK1 cDNA into the NotI site of a pCAG-Myc-stop vector containing a Myc epitope sequence (EQKLISEEDL) and three frame-stop codons (30Ishizaki T. Naito M. Fujisawa K. Maekawa M. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The cDNA for a TESK1(S439A) mutant was constructed to replace Ser-439 with Ala, using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Expression plasmids coding for hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged 14-3-3β were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified human 14-3-3β cDNA (nt 373–1197) into the BamHI site of the pBOS-HA-stop vector (31Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). The plasmid coding for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-14-3-3β fusion protein was constructed by inserting 14-3-3β cDNA into theBamHI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The authenticity of plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, HeLa and COS-7 cells were transfected with 8 μg of plasmid DNA per 100-mm dish, using the modified calcium phosphate method (32Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) or the LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) method. Rabbit anti-TESK1 antibody (TK-C21) was raised against the C-terminal peptide of rat TESK1 and purified on antigenic peptide-conjugated columns, as described (10Toshima J. Koji T. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The anti-Myc epitope monoclonal antibody (9E10) and the anti-HA epitope monoclonal antibody (12CA5) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-HA polyclonal antibody was provided by Dr. Y. Fujiki (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). Anti-14-3-3β monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), suspended in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and then incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (20 μl of 50% slurry) for 3 h at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-TESK1, anti-HA, or anti-Myc antibody, and protein A-Sepharose (20 μl of 50% slurry) overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and used for immunoblot analysis or for in vitro kinase reaction. For immunoblot analysis, cell lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20. After washing in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using an ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Lysates of COS-7 cells expressing Myc-TESK1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of phosphatase buffer, with or without 30 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan). After washing, the protein complexes were eluted with 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 95 °C, diluted 1:10 with RIPA buffer, and subjected to in vitro pull-down assay. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described (33Nagata K. Ohashi K. Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 99-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, suspended in RIPA buffer, and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, lysates were precleared with glutathione-Sepharose (40 μl of 50% slurry) for 3 h at 4 °C. The precleared supernatants were incubated with GST-14-3-3β fusion proteins overnight at 4 °C, and then glutathione-Sepharose (20 μl of 50% slurry) was added and the preparation further incubated for 1 h. The beads were washed twice with wash buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. For peptide competition assay, GST-14-3-3β fusion protein was preincubated with excess amounts of the phosphorylated Ser-439 peptide (pS439 peptide, VRRCR(pS)LPSSPEL) or the control non-phosphorylated peptide (S439 peptide, VRRCRSLPSSPEL) for 1 h at 4 °C before incubation with cell lysates. These peptides were synthesized by K. Tamura and Dr. S. Aimoto (Osaka University). Lysates of HeLa or COS-7 cells expressing TESK1, Myc-TESK1, or Myc-TESK1(S439A) were immunoprecipitated with anti-TESK1 or 9E10 anti-Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mmMgCl2) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the kinase reaction buffer containing 0–100 μg/ml purified GST-14-3-3β protein and then for 30 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 10 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 50 μg/ml His6-tagged cofilin. The reaction mixture was solubilized in Laemmli's sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 95 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto membranes and 32P incorporation into cofilin was visualized by autoradiography, using a BAS 1800 Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The kinase activity was normalized by dividing the radioactivity incorporated into cofilin by the immunoreactive density of TESK1 estimated by densitometer. For cell adhesion assay, 100- or 35-mm culture dishes were coated overnight at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) or 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) in PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma) in PBS for 2 h before the cells were plated. HeLa cells or its mutant cell lines stably expressing TESK1 (HeLa/TESK1 cells) or TESK1(D170A) (HeLa/TESK1(D170A) cells) (12Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) were cultured for 24 h in serum-free DMEM, trypsinized, suspended in 5 ml of DMEM, and then plated onto fibronectin- or poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. After incubation for 0–60 min at 37 °C, adherent cells were used for cell staining or used for in vitro pull-down assay, co-immunoprecipitation assay, or in vitro kinase assay after the lysis with RIPA buffer. HeLa cells transfected with plasmids for HA-tagged 14-3-3β with or without plasmids coding for Myc-tagged TESK1, TESK1(D170A), or TESK1(S439A) were cultured in serum-free DMEM. About 2 × 105 cells were trypsinized, suspended in 1 ml of DMEM, and then replated on fibronectin-coated or noncoated glass coverslips. After incubation for 15–60 min at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphatase buffer, and stained with 9E10 anti-Myc antibody and anti-HA polyclonal antibody, as described (12Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Amano T. Yang N. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1131-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Similarly, HeLa, HeLa/TESK1, and HeLa/TESK1(D170A) cells were plated on fibronectin-coated dishes and stained for F-actin with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). To identify proteins that interact with TESK1, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. A HeLa cell cDNA library constructed in the GAL4 transactivation domain vector (pPC86) was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system, and for a bait we used the cDNA for the C-terminal region of TESK1 (TK1-1, amino acid residues 288–626, in Fig. 1 A) constructed in the GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector (pDBLeu). Of 3 × 106initial transformants, 133 clones were selected for being positive in histidine prototrophy assay and in either or both of uracil prototrophy and β-galactosidase assays. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that 49 positive clones, composed of 22 independent clones, contained cDNAs encoding the full-length amino acid sequence of human 14-3-3β protein. In re-transformation assays, yeast cells co-transformed with pDBLeu-TK1-1 and pPC86–14-3-3β were grown in selection medium, but not so for the cells co-transformed with pDBLeu-TK1-1 and pPC86 vector or the cells with pDBLeu vector and pPC86–14-3-3β (Fig. 1 B), thus indicating the specific interaction between the C-terminal region of TESK1 and 14-3-3β. To determine the region of TESK1 that interacts with 14-3-3β, we prepared a series of pDBLeu constructs coding for TESK1 fragments (Fig.1 A), and we examined the potential to interact with 14-3-3β in the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig.1 B, 14-3-3β interacted with TK1-2 (amino acid residues 339–455) but not with TK1-3 (residues 462–626) or TK1-4 (residues 1–306). These results suggest that 14-3-3β interacts with TESK1 via the region of amino acid residues 339–455. In this sequence, we noted three regions that were highly conserved between the sequences of TESK1 and TESK2 (termed conserved regions 1–3 (CR1, CR2, and CR3), Fig.1 A) (9Toshima J. Toshima J.Y. Takeuchi K. Mori R. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31449-31458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The specific interaction of 14-3-3β with the C-terminal region of rat TESK2 (TK2-1, residues 299–570) was also detected using the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that 14-3-3β interacts with the C-terminal regions of TESK1 and TESK2, and their conserved regions, CR1 to CR3, are presumably involved in the interaction. To determine whether 14-3-3β interacts with TESK1 in mammalian cells, we co-expressed HA epitope-tagged, full-length 14-3-3β (HA-14-3-3β) and full-length TESK1 in COS-7 cells. When lysates of COS-7 cells co-expressing HA-14-3-3β and TESK1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-TESK1 antibody, HA-14-3-3β was detected in the TESK1 immune complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Similarly, when lysates of COS-7 cells expressing HA-14-3-3β alone were immunoprecipitated with anti-TESK1 antibody, a faint band of HA-14-3-3β was detected in the TESK1 immune complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 2); this band seems to be HA-14-3-3β which co-precipitated with endogenous TESK1. Conversely, when lysates of COS-7 cells co-expressing HA-14-3-3β with TESK1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, TESK1 was detected in the HA-14-3-3β immune complex (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). In addition, a kinase-inactive mutant, TESK1(D170A), in which the presumptive catalytic residue Asp-170 is replaced by alanine, was also co-precipitated with HA-14-3-3β (Fig.2 B, lane 4), indicating that the kinase activity of TESK1 is not required for the interaction with 14-3-3β. In some experiments (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), TESK1 protein was detected as a doublet. Based on the elution position on SDS-PAGE, the upper band may be a phosphorylated form of TESK1. We next examined whether TESK1 would directly bind to 14-3-3β, using in vitro pull-down assays. Expression plasmids coding for Myc-tagged full-length TESK1 and a series of C-terminally truncated TESK1 mutants, termed Δ1 to Δ4, were constructed and transfected into COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 A). Immunoblot analysis of COS-7 cell lysates with anti-Myc antibody confirmed the expression of Myc-TESK1 and its truncated mutants with their expected molecular masses (Fig. 3 B, left panel). Cell lysates were incubated with GST-14-3-3β fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. The pull-down assay revealed that full-length TESK1 and Δ1 co-precipitated with GST-14-3-3β but Δ2, Δ3, and Δ4 mutants did"
https://openalex.org/W2000849578,"Recently, we and others have reported that mRNAs may be polyadenylated in plant mitochondria, and that polyadenylation accelerates the degradation rate of mRNAs. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in plant mitochondrial mRNA degradation, we have analyzed the polyadenylation and degradation processes of potato atp9mRNAs. The overall majority of polyadenylation sites of potato atp9 mRNAs is located at or in the vicinity of their mature 3′-extremities. We show that a 3′- to 5′-exoribonuclease activity is responsible for the preferential degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs as compared with non-polyadenylated mRNAs, and that 20–30 adenosine residues constitute the optimal poly(A) tail size for inducing degradation of RNA substrates in vitro. The addition of as few as seven non-adenosine nucleotides 3′ to the poly(A) tail is sufficient to almost completely inhibit the in vitro degradation of the RNA substrate. Interestingly, the exoribonuclease activity proceeds unimpeded by stable secondary structures present in RNA substrates. From these results, we propose that in plant mitochondria, poly(A) tails added at the 3′ ends of mRNAs promote an efficient 3′- to 5′- degradation process. Recently, we and others have reported that mRNAs may be polyadenylated in plant mitochondria, and that polyadenylation accelerates the degradation rate of mRNAs. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in plant mitochondrial mRNA degradation, we have analyzed the polyadenylation and degradation processes of potato atp9mRNAs. The overall majority of polyadenylation sites of potato atp9 mRNAs is located at or in the vicinity of their mature 3′-extremities. We show that a 3′- to 5′-exoribonuclease activity is responsible for the preferential degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs as compared with non-polyadenylated mRNAs, and that 20–30 adenosine residues constitute the optimal poly(A) tail size for inducing degradation of RNA substrates in vitro. The addition of as few as seven non-adenosine nucleotides 3′ to the poly(A) tail is sufficient to almost completely inhibit the in vitro degradation of the RNA substrate. Interestingly, the exoribonuclease activity proceeds unimpeded by stable secondary structures present in RNA substrates. From these results, we propose that in plant mitochondria, poly(A) tails added at the 3′ ends of mRNAs promote an efficient 3′- to 5′- degradation process. polymerase chain reaction 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid reverse transcriptase base pair(s) untranslated region open reading frame The control of mRNA stability constitutes an important aspect of the regulation of gene expression in all organisms. Polyadenylation of mRNAs is involved in the control of mRNA stability, however, with two significantly different roles depending on the organism or subcellular compartment concerned. Polyadenylation is required for stabilizing virtually all nuclear-encoded mRNAs in all eukaryotes. In contrast, polyadenylation targets mRNAs for degradation in eubacteria (1Carpousis A.J. Vanzo N.F.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2308-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In eubacteria and chloroplasts, degradation of mRNAs is initiated by endonucleolytic cleavages. The resulting fragments are then degraded by 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activities (1Carpousis A.J. Vanzo N.F. Raynal L.C. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Hayes R. Kudla J. Gruissem W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 199-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In both systems, polyadenylation targets endonucleolytic cleavage products for rapid degradation. In chloroplasts, structured mature 3′ ends are poor substrates for polyadenylation as compared with the internal RNA fragments generated by endonuclease(s) (5Hayes R. Kudla J. Gruissem W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 199-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Schuster G. Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 120: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In plant mitochondria, molecular mechanisms involved in mRNA stability or degradation are still poorly understood (11Giégé P. Brennicke A. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 2001; 324: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For instance, no proteins involved in these processes have been formally identified, although several candidate genes have now been identified since the completion of the nuclear genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana. Stable secondary structures can be predicted at the 3′-extremities of some but not all plant mitochondrial mRNAs (12Schuster W. Hiesel R. Isaac P.G. Leaver C.J. Brennicke A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5943-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When present, these structures appear to be involved in stabilizing the transcripts (13Kaleikau E.K. Andre C.P. Walbot V. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Bellaoui M. Pelletier G. Budar F.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5069-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and in the correct processing of 3′-extremities rather than being signals for transcription termination (15Dombrowski S. Brennicke A. Binder S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5069-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mature 3′ termini of plant mitochondria mRNAs are generated by 3′-processing of longer pre-mRNA molecules (15Dombrowski S. Brennicke A. Binder S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5069-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and stable mature mRNAs are not constitutively polyadenylated at their 3′-extremities. However, we have previously shown that sunflower atp1-orf522 mitochondrial mRNAs may be polyadenylated in vivo (7Gagliardi D. Leaver C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the orf522 gene being the gene linked to the cytoplasmic male sterility phenotype in sunflower. We have reported that polyadenylation accelerates the degradation rate of the transcripts both in vivo and in vitro as compared with non-polyadenylated transcripts (7Gagliardi D. Leaver C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Maize cox2 mRNAs may also be polyadenylated, although the influence of polyadenylation on the degradation rate in vitro is less pronounced (8Lupold D.S. Caoile A.G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1565-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, polyadenylation of pea atp9 and Oenothera atp1 transcripts has also been characterized (9Kuhn J. Tengler U. Binder S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both transcripts terminate with a stable double stem-loop structure, which compensates to some extent for the destabilization effect of polyadenylation in vitro (9Kuhn J. Tengler U. Binder S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined the position of polyadenylation sites in potato mitochondria atp9 mRNAs and studied the influence of poly(A) tails on the degradation of atp9mRNAs by mitochondrial RNase activities. The expression of the potato atp9 gene has been well documented (16Dell'Orto P. Moenne A. Graves P.V. Jordana X. Plant Sci. (Limerick). 1993; 88: 45-53Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Lizama L. Holuigue L. Jordana X. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The size of atp9 transcripts is relatively small, i.e.from 540 to 551 nucleotides. The 5′ termini are derived from transcription initiation (17Lizama L. Holuigue L. Jordana X. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the position of editing sites has been characterized within the open reading frame (16Dell'Orto P. Moenne A. Graves P.V. Jordana X. Plant Sci. (Limerick). 1993; 88: 45-53Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Most importantly for our studies, a stable stem-loop is predicted within the 3′-UTR of atp9 mRNAs, and this putative secondary structure is located 67–71 nucleotides upstream of the mapped 3′-extremities of the mRNAs (17Lizama L. Holuigue L. Jordana X. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we show that most polyadenylation sites of atp9 transcripts are located in a small window of 10 nucleotides, which spans the 3′ mature ends. We show that an exoribonuclease activity is responsible for the degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs, and that the nucleotide composition and the size of the poly(A) tail added at the 3′-extremities of atp9mRNAs can influence the degradation rate in vitro. Interestingly, the progression of the exoribonuclease activity is not hindered by the presence of a stable secondary structure present in the 3′-UTR of atp9 mRNAs. The position of poly(A) tails and the ability of the exoribonuclease activity to progress through secondary structures of the RNA substrate indicate that poly(A) tails added at the 3′-extremities of mRNAs promote an efficient 3′- to 5′-degradation process in plant mitochondria. Mitochondria were isolated from potato tubers (var Bintje) by differential centrifugations and purification on Percoll gradients as described previously (18Fey J. Vermel M. Grienenberger J.M. Maréchal-Drouard L. Gualberto J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial RNAs (10 μg) from potato tubers were incubated with 10 units of DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNAs were reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT)18-adapter primer (Table I) and Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). Aliquots of cDNA reactions were subjected to PCR1amplification using the adapter primer in combination with an atp9 gene-specific primer (P1, P2, or P3, Table I) and Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR amplification was performed using 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 50 °C, and 72 °C followed by one step of 5 min at 72 °C. PCR products from the whole reaction were purified using Qiagen PCR purification columns and cloned using a TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen).Table IList of PCR primersOligo(dT)18-adapter primerCGACCCTCGAGAGGATCCCG(T)18Adapter primerCGACCCTCGAGAGGATCCCGatp9 primer P1GCTTTGCATGAACATCTCAATGatp9 primer P2CGAAACTCGAGATGTTAGAAGGTGCatp9 primer P3TCGTATTCTAAGTTCGTTAGTAATCGatp9 primer P4GGGACCGCGAAGACAGCCCACCT3-atp9primerCTCGAGAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGTAACTGGCCGAGAAGGCThe underlined sequence in the T3-atp9 primer corresponds to the T3 RNA polymerase promoter sequence Open table in a new tab The underlined sequence in the T3-atp9 primer corresponds to the T3 RNA polymerase promoter sequence Frozen mitochondrial pellets were resuspended at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50 mm MOPS, 250 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and frozen/thawed five times. The mitochondrial lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. At this salt concentration, most RNase activities are recovered in the 20,000 × g supernatant (data not shown). Protein fractions corresponding to 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, and 60–80% saturation at 0 °C of ammonium sulfate were prepared, dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, at 4 °C, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The ammonium sulfate fractions were assayed for RNase activities, and two distinct RNase activities (named 1 and 2) were identified. Most RNase activities 2 and 1 were recovered in the 20–40% and 60–80% fractions, respectively. The 40–60% fraction contained a mixture of both activities (data not shown). To further purify RNase activity 2, the 20–40% ammonium sulfate fraction was fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography using a 1-ml UNOQ column (Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated in 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5. Elution steps were performed first using 100 mm and then 300 mm KCl in 10 mmMOPS, pH 7.5. The 300 mm KCl fraction contained most RNase activity 2 and was dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, at 4 °C and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The non-polyadenylated RNA substrate in Figs. 3, 5, and 6 corresponds to the last 136 nucleotides of atp9 mRNAs ending at site h in Fig.1 C and was generated from PCR products amplified using the T3-atp9 primer and reverse primer P4 (Table I) from an atp9 cDNA clone. The polyadenylated substrate was generated from PCR products amplified using the T3-atp9 primer and the adapter primer (Table I) from an atp9cDNA clone, corresponding to atp9 mRNAs polyadenylated at site h in Fig. 1 C, and digested using the AlwI restriction enzyme. In Fig. 6, poly(A)19N7 and N20 substrates were produced by digesting T3-atp9 primer/adapter primer PCR products by BamHI or by omitting the digestion step, respectively. All RNA substrates were synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) and either uniformly labeled using [α-32P]UTP or 5′-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP as indicated in the figure legends. A similar strategy was employed to generate non-polyadenylated and polyadenylated RNA substrates presented in Fig. 7 by using a cDNA clone corresponding to atp9 mRNAs polyadenylated at site i in Fig. 1 C.Figure 5Analysis by thin layer chromatography of degradation products generated by RNase activities 1 and 2.Uniformly [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA substrates are as indicated in Fig. 3.

The presence or absence of 1 mm ATP had little influence on the degradation rates and patterns produced by the ammonium sulfate extracts and was omitted when using the UNOQ fraction. At the indicated time, aliquots of the degradation reactions were extracted by phenol-chloroform and fractionated on 6% (w/v) acrylamide/7m urea gels. Aliquots of degradation assays were removed at the indicated time and extracted with phenol-chloroform. Aliquots were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (Sigma), and the chromatography was developed using 0.25 mKH2PO4. Standards (UTP, UDP, UMP, or Pi) were run alongside the samples. Putative polyadenylation sites in atp9mRNAs were identified by a similar RT-PCR strategy as was used in our study of the sunflower atp1-orf522 transcripts (7Gagliardi D. Leaver C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from potato mitochondrial RNAs using an oligo(dT)18-adapter primer. PCR amplification experiments were then conducted using an atp9 gene-specific primer (P1, P2, or P3) and an adapter primer. We first used the primer P3 designed to detect polyadenylation sites within the 3′-UTR of atp9 mRNAs (see Fig.1 A for primer location). A discrete band of 250 bp was amplified using the primer P3 and the adapter primer (Fig. 1 B). Products from the whole PCR were cloned, and 51 atp9 clones were sequenced. 94% of the atp9 clones (48 out of 51 clones) contained a poly(A) tail located in a small region of 10 nucleotides (sites d–j in Fig.1 C). Most of these polyadenylation sites (39 out of 48) were found at sites h–j that correspond to previously mapped 3′ termini (17Lizama L. Holuigue L. Jordana X. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In only 3 out of 51 clones, poly(A) tails were detected 29 nucleotides 5′ to the putative stem-loop structure, within the stem-loop, or immediately 3′ to the stem-loop (sites a–c, respectively, in Fig. 1 C). The polyadenylation site 3′ to the stem-loop (site c) is the only site that is detected in a relatively A-rich region (4 A nucleotides out of 5). Therefore, site c is the only polyadenylation site in the 3′-UTR of atp9mRNAs for which we cannot exclude an artifactual priming of the oligo(dT)18-adapter primer during cDNA synthesis. We then used primer P2 in RT-PCR experiments (see Fig. 1 Afor primer location) to detect possible additional polyadenylation sites within the open reading frame of atp9 mRNAs. Three discrete bands of 470, 270, and 200 bp, respectively, were observed (Fig. 1 B). PCR products from whole PCR reactions were cloned. Of 49 clones, 40 clones corresponded to the three major products amplified by PCR. The 200-bp band does not correspond to atp9 mRNAs but to rps3 mRNAs. This amplification is explained by the presence of eight consecutive adenosine residues in rps3 sequence, and by the fact that the 11 3′-nucleotides of primer P2 are present in rsp3sequence upstream of the A-rich region. Unexpectedly, the 270-bp band corresponds to mRNAs transcribed from an atp9 gene, which contains several nucleotide substitutions as compared with the genuine potato atp9 gene or an atp9 pseudogene previously identified (16Dell'Orto P. Moenne A. Graves P.V. Jordana X. Plant Sci. (Limerick). 1993; 88: 45-53Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession numbers X63610 and X63611, respectively) (Fig.2). This newly identified atp9gene (GenBankTM accession number AJ344260) is probably a non-functional gene, as this sequence contains a deletion of four nucleotides as compared with the genuine atp9 ORF, which thus disrupts the open reading frame (Fig. 2). However, this gene is expressed at the RNA level, because we identified four editing sites within this sequence (Fig. 2). The poly(A) tails observed immediately 3′ to a UAG codon situated at the position of the original stop codon in the genuine atp9 gene are encoded by the genomic sequence and thus do not correspond to post-transcriptional polyadenylation. The 470-bp band in Fig. 1 B corresponds to atp9 mRNAs polyadenylated at their mature 3′-extremities at sites h and i. All previously characterized editing sites (16Dell'Orto P. Moenne A. Graves P.V. Jordana X. Plant Sci. (Limerick). 1993; 88: 45-53Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were found edited in these clones. We could detect only 2 out of 49 clones that correspond to atp9 mRNAs, which are polyadenylated within the atp9 ORF. The poly(A) tails are located at nucleotides +60 and +63 respective to the first nucleotide of the start codon (Fig. 1 D). Amplification products corresponding to these polyadenylated transcripts are not visible on ethidium bromide-stained gels (Fig. 1 B), and their rare occurrence among cloned polyadenylated atp9 mRNAs indicates that they are of low abundance as compared with those transcripts polyadenylated at the 3′-extremities. The seven remaining clones corresponded to the expected atp9 sequences fused either to the 5′-extremities of atp9 mRNAs or to other mRNAs, such as atp1 or nad4 (data not shown), and were not further investigated. Polyadenylation sites within the 5′-UTR were not detected, although the oligo(dT)18-adapter primer annealed to two relatively A-rich regions present 9 and 60 nucleotides 3′ to primer P1 (data not shown). In conclusion, our results show that potato atp9mRNAs may be polyadenylated in vivo, and that most of the characterized polyadenylation sites are present at their 3′-extremities. The size of the cloned poly(A) tails of atp9 mRNAs usually corresponds to the size of the oligo(dT)18-adapter primer. However, poly(A) tails from 31 to 55 nucleotides were observed for seven clones. To analyze the nucleotide composition of these tails, 18 A nucleotides, which correspond to the length of the oligo(dT)18-adapter primer, were subtracted from each tail. Of the 136 remaining nucleotides, we detected only 5 guanosines and 131 adenosines (i.e. 96% of A nucleotides), indicating that the poly(A) tails are mainly homopolymeric. The RT-PCR strategy we employed to clone polyadenylated atp9 mRNAs cannot be used to estimate the real length of poly(A) tails in vivo, but our results indicate that some atp9 poly(A) tails may be as long as 55 nucleotides. Similar results were previously reported for maize cox2 mRNAs (8Lupold D.S. Caoile A.G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1565-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using primers P2 and P3, we also observed that four clones contained an additional C or a small nucleotide extension (ATAT) between the genome-encoded atp9sequence and the poly(A) tail. We cannot exclude the generation of artifacts during cDNA synthesis or PCR amplification. However, this extension could correspond to the addition of non-genomically encoded nucleotides to the 3′ termini of atp9 mRNAs. Such extensions have recently been characterized for several plant mitochondrial transcripts (9Kuhn J. Tengler U. Binder S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Williams M.A. Johzuka Y. Mulligan R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4444-4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We detected two RNase activities (named 1 and 2) in potato mitochondrial extracts (Fig.3 A). These two distinct activities were separated from each other by ammonium sulfate precipitation (see under “Experimental Procedures”). RNase activities 1 and 2 were separately incubated in the presence of either non-polyadenylated or polyadenylated atp9 RNA substrates (Fig. 3 A). Both RNA substrates correspond to the last 136 nucleotides of atp9 mRNAs, ending at site h in Fig.1 C, with the addition of 19 adenosine residues in the case of the polyadenylated substrate. As shown in Fig. 3 A, RNase activity 1 degrades non-polyadenylated and polyadenylated atp9 RNA substrates at similar rates. Several faint degradation intermediates were detected. In contrast, the non-polyadenylated atp9 RNA substrate is stable in an RNase activity 2 protein extract, whereas the polyadenylated atp9RNA substrate is degraded in this fraction (Fig. 3 A). Using a PhosphorImager, we estimated in three separate experiments that from 55 to 74% of the input full-length polyadenylated substrate is degraded over a 60-min incubation with the RNase activity 2 fraction, whereas only 0–5% of the non-polyadenylated substrate was degraded. One intermediate (marked by a white arrow in Fig.3 A) is generated during the degradation of the polyadenylated atp9 RNA substrate. This intermediate is similar in size to the non-polyadenylated RNA substrate and represents <30% of the input full-length polyadenylated substrate after an incubation of 60 min with the RNase activity 2 fraction. The intermediate is produced by the removal of the poly(A) tail from the polyadenylated substrate as shown by incubating 5′-32P-labeled RNA substrates with RNase activity 2 (Fig.3 B). However, this intermediate is no longer observed when RNase activity 2 is further purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 3 C). Thus, this additional purification step allows the elimination of either protein(s) or nucleic acids responsible for the formation of this intermediate (see under “Discussion”). This result shows that RNase activity 2 is not impeded at the junction between the poly(A) tail and the remaining RNA substrate, but that this property is dependent on the in vitro conditions,e.g. the degree of purity of the protein extract. Thus, the results presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that polyadenylation promotes degradation of atp9 mRNAs in potato mitochondria by RNase activity 2. The stability of the non-polyadenylated atp9 RNA substrate in the RNase activity 2 protein fraction indicates that this fraction is not contaminated by RNase activity 1. Conversely, an analysis of the degradation products of both RNase activities revealed that RNase activity 1 fraction is not contaminated by RNase activity 2 (see Fig.5). Remarkably, we did not observe a degradation intermediate that would correspond to the stalling of RNase activity 2 within or 3′ to the stable stem-loop structure predicted to exist in the 3′-UTR of atp9 mRNAs (Fig. 3 C). However, the RNA substrate is structured as several degradation intermediates are observed when the polyadenylated atp9 RNA substrate is incubated in the presence of phosphodiesterase (Fig. 3 D), an exoribonuclease known to be impeded by structured RNAs. Among the degradation intermediates, a fragment marked by a black arrow in Fig. 3 D corresponds in size to the stalling of phosphodiesterase at the predicted stem-loop structure. This suggests that the predicted stem-loop structure exists, but results presented in Fig. 3 C show that RNase activity 2 can proceed unimpeded by this stable secondary structure once degradation is initiated by the poly(A) tail. To further check the ability of RNase activity 2 to proceed through RNA secondary structures, we incubated RNase activity 2 with a synthetic RNA substrate derived from nucleotides 3095 to 3230 of the maize rps2A gene (GenBankTM accession numberAF273103). This RNA substrate is predicted to fold into a double stem-loop structure (Fig. 4 A). As expected, the non-polyadenylated rps2A RNA substrate was stable in the protein extract, whereas the polyadenylated version of this RNA substrate was degraded (Fig. 4 B). No major degradation intermediates were observed, confirming the ability of RNase activity 2 to degrade structured RNA substrates. The products of the degradation of atp9 RNA substrates by both RNase activities were analyzed using polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Fig. 5). Under the conditions used, only monoribonucleotides and Pi migrate on the plates, whereas oligoribonucleotides remain at the origin. As shown in Fig. 5, no degradation products generated by RNase activity 1 were visible on the chromatogram, demonstrating that RNase activity 1 is an endoribonuclease. Conversely, the production of ribonucleosides diphosphate and either ribonucleosides monophosphate and/or Pi was observed in RNase activity 2 protein extracts. A higher level of degradation products was observed for the polyadenylated substrate as compared with the non-polyadenylated substrate (Fig. 5), which is consistent with the preferential degradation of polyadenylated substrates presented in Figs.3 A, 6, and 7. At this preliminary stage of RNase activity 2 purification, it is impossible to determine the exact nature of the primary degradation products that are generated by RNase activity 2 (see under “Discussion”). However, the release of monoribonucleotides by RNase activity 2 conclusively shows that an exoribonuclease activity is involved in the degradation of polyadenylated plant mitochondrial mRNAs. The data presented do not rule out the possibility that the degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs is initiated by an endoribonuclease that would generates RNA moieties, which are then degraded by an exoribonuclease. To investigate this possibility, RNase activity 2 was incubated with atp9 RNA substrates containing no poly(A) tail, a poly(A) tail of 19 residues, or a poly(A) tail of 19 residues followed by 7 or 20 nucleotides. Only the RNA substrate with the poly(A) tail accessible at the 3′-extremity was degraded by RNase activity 2 (Fig. 6). Only a very limited degradation was observed for the RNA substrates containing 7 or 20 nucleotides 3′ to the poly(A) tail. This result demonstrates that the poly(A) tail must be accessible at the 3′-extremity to initiate degradation and strongly supports the conclusion of a direct recruitment of an exoribonuclease activity by the poly(A) tail. To test the influence of the size of poly(A) tails on the degradation rate, atp9 RNA substrates ending at site i in Fig. 1 C and containing 0, 5, 20, 27, or 55 A-long poly(A) tails were incubated in the presence of RNase activity 2 (Fig.7 A). An identical degradation intermediate (marked by a white arrow) is produced for all polyadenylated substrates, although hardly discernible on Fig. 7 for the poly(A)5 RNA substrate, confirming that this intermediate is produced by the removal of the poly(A) tails. RNA substrates containing either no poly(A) tail or a poly(A) tail of five residues were not significantly degraded, indicating that five adenosine residues are not sufficient to initiate degradation. In contrast, poly(A) tails of 20 and 27 residues did promote degradation. Surprisingly, we observed a slight but reproducible reduced degradation rate of the poly(A)55 RNA substrate as compared with poly(A)20 and poly(A)27 RNA substrates (Fig.7 A). This result was confirmed when poly(A)20and poly(A)55 RNA substrates were incubated simultaneously with RNase activity 2 (Fig. 7, B and C). These experiments suggest that at least in vitro there is an optimal length of the poly(A) tail to induce degradation of RNA substrates by RNase activity 2. In this report, we show that atp9 mRNAs may be polyadenylated in potato mitochondria, and that polyadenylation accelerates the degradation rate of mRNA substrates by an exoribonuclease activity termed RNase activity 2. Under our experimental conditions, non-polyadenylated RNA substrates are not significantly degraded after a 1-h incubation in the protein extracts, whereas the amount of RNA substrates with 20–27 adenosine residues at the 3′ terminus is significantly reduced (Figs. 3, 4, 6, and 7). In eubacteria, polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase II are the major 3′- to 5′-exoribonucleases involved in the RNA degradation process (2Régnier P. Arraiano C.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and a polynucleotide phosphorylase-like protein has been characterized in chloroplasts (20Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that a 5′- to 3′-exoribonucleolytic activity is involved in RNA degradation pathways in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts (21Drager R.G. Higgs D.C. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant J. 1999; 19: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we present two lines of evidence strongly in favor of the involvement of a 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activity in the degradation of plant mitochondrial polyadenylated mRNAs. First, the addition of seven nucleotides (including six non-A nucleotides) 3′ to the poly(A) tail almost completely abolishes the degradation of the polyadenylated substrate (Fig. 6). This finding strongly suggests that the poly(A) tail must be exposed at the 3′ end to recruit an exonuclease activity. However, this hypothesis is tempered by the finding that at least one endonuclease, the bacterial endonuclease RNase E, preferentially binds single-stranded extremities (22Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, our second line of evidence is that the preferential degradation of polyadenylated RNA substrates is accompanied by the release of monoribonucleotides from a [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA substrate (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results show that RNase activity 2 either is or contains a 3′- to 5′-exoribonuclease activity. However, further purification of RNase activity 2 will be required to ascertain whether either nucleoside monophosphate or diphosphate is produced by this activity, i.e. whether RNase activity 2 is a hydrolytic or a phosphorolytic enzyme, respectively. Alternatively, the RNase activity 2 fraction may contain both a hydrolytic RNase and a phosphorolytic RNase. The major characteristic of plant mitochondrial mRNA polyadenylation as compared with the situation in chloroplasts is the position of the polyadenylation sites. We have demonstrated here that the majority of poly(A) tails are added at nucleotides that correspond to the mature 3′ ends of atp9 mRNAs. Only minor polyadenylation sites were detected within the atp9ORF or at the level of a stable secondary structure present within the 3′-UTR of atp9 mRNAs. This secondary structure does not hinder the progression of RNase activity 2 (Fig. 3). Thus, we believe that poly(A) tails added at the mature 3′ ends recruit RNase activity 2, which then proceeds in a 3′ to 5′ direction to degrade the mRNA. This finding is in striking contrast with the results obtained for chloroplast mRNAs in which most of the polyadenylation sites correspond to endoribonucleolytic cleavage sites (5Hayes R. Kudla J. Gruissem W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 199-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Schuster G. Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 120: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mature 3′ ends of chloroplasts mRNAs may also be polyadenylated but with a frequency approximately 50 times less than endoribonucleolytic cleavage products (3Lisitsky I. Klaff P. Schuster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13398-13403Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4Kudla J. Hayes R. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7137-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To date, the polyadenylation of only four plant mitochondrial mRNAs has been reported. The 3′ ends of either sunflower atp1-orf522 (7Gagliardi D. Leaver C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or pea atp9 and Oenothera atp1 (9Kuhn J. Tengler U. Binder S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) are predicted to fold into a single stem-loop or a double inverted stem-loop structure, respectively. Polyadenylation sites were found within or 3′ but not 5′ to these predicted secondary structures. Maize cox2mRNAs are the only example so far where several internal polyadenylation sites have been reported (8Lupold D.S. Caoile A.G. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1565-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, 42% of the polyadenylation sites in maize cox2 mRNAs correspond to mapped 3′-extremities, which far exceeds the proportion of polyadenylated 3′ ends of chloroplast mRNAs investigated to date. Thus, although the polyadenylation/degradation relationship is conserved between plant mitochondria and chloroplasts, there seems to be a clear difference in the polyadenylation processes in these two plant organelles. A degradation intermediate corresponding to the removal of the poly(A) tail is observed only in the protein extract corresponding to the 20–40% ammonium sulfate fraction. This intermediate was not observed or was present at greatly reduced levels in few experiments (data not shown), when RNase activity 2 was further purified onto an anion-exchange column (Fig. 3 C). Thus, during this additional purification step, protein(s) and/or nucleic acids that are responsible for the formation of the intermediate are eliminated. Several hypotheses can be proposed to explain the removal of the poly(A) tail in the 20–40% ammonium sulfate fraction. First, a poly(A)-specific nuclease or a RNase activity that would stall at the junction of the poly(A) tail and of the remainder of the RNA substrate could be present in the fraction. The polyadenylated substrate would be converted into a non-polyadenylated substrate and, hence, accumulate as it is stable in this extract. The poly(A)-specific nuclease activity would be lost during the next step of RNase activity 2 purification. Second, there could be competition between RNase activity 2 and other proteins that are involved in the correct processing of mature 3′ termini. Such a phenomenon has been described for instance in chloroplasts (20Hayes R. Kudla J. Schuster G. Gabay L. Maliga P. Gruissem W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and in yeast mitochondria (23Min J. Zassenhaus H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4167-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Third, RNase activity 2 could in some cases dissociate from the substrate at the junction of the poly(A) tail and of the remainder of the RNA substrate as has been observed for the bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (24Blum E. Carpousis A.J. Higgins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4009-4016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Endogenous nucleic acids present in the 20–40% ammonium sulfate fraction but removed during the anion-exchange chromatography step could influence the stalling or dissociation of RNase activity 2 after degradation of the poly(A) tail. We have demonstrated that 7 or 20 nucleotides added at the 3′ end of the poly(A) tail of atp9 RNA substrate efficiently inhibit the in vitro degradation (Fig. 6). Although we cannot exclude that these artificial 3′ extensions would fold into very stable secondary structures, we consider it more likely that the actual nucleotide composition of the tail added at the 3′ ends of mRNAs is a determinant for initiating degradation. RNase activity 2 seems to specifically recognize poly(A) tails that would thus represent a degradation tag rather than be merely an unstructured single-stranded extension required by RNase activity 2 to initiate degradation. We have shown that five adenosine residues are not sufficient to trigger degradation (Fig. 7). A similar result was also observed for pea atp9 mRNA (9Kuhn J. Tengler U. Binder S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that 55 A-long tails are not as efficient at initiating degradation as are 20 or 27 A-long tails (Fig. 7). These results may give information regarding the actual recognition mechanism by RNase activity 2 of its RNA substrate. This finding suggests that there is not only a minimal but rather an optimal size of the poly(A) tail that is recognized by RNase activity 2. The mRNA sequence 5′ to the poly(A) tail may also contribute to the recognition of the polyadenylated RNA substrate by RNase activity 2. Alternatively, we cannot exclude that 55 A-long poly(A) tails may be recognized by RNA-binding proteins that may affect RNase activity 2 recruitment or progression. Despite the similarities that exist between bacterial, chloroplast, and plant mitochondrial mRNA polyadenylation/degradation processes, a combination of features such as location, composition, or length of poly(A) tails seem specific to each biological system. The results presented here show that potato atp9 transcripts are primarily polyadenylated at their 3′-extremities, and that poly(A) tails represent an efficient degradation tag, which recruits a 3′- to 5′-exonuclease activity. This activity can then proceed unimpeded by secondary structures in the RNA substrate. An important aspect of our understanding of the RNA degradation process in plant mitochondria will be to determine the actual signal that targets a particular mRNA molecule to be polyadenylated and, thus, degraded.

These domains organize receptor-mediated signaling events at the plasma membrane. Fatty acylation is one mechanism for targeting proteins to rafts. It was therefore of interest to determine if protein palmitoyltransferase activity is also present in these domains. In this study, protein palmitoyltransferase activity, assayed using G-protein alpha subunits as a substrate, was found to be highly enriched in low density membranes derived from cells that express caveolin as well as those that do not.

This effect was reversed by adding cholesterol to cyclodextrin-treated cells. When reconstituted into cell membranes, the population of purified recombinant Gαi that was palmitoylated was highly enriched in the low density membrane fractions, whereas the bulk unmodified Gαi-protein was largely excluded.

Increasing evidence indicates that signaling molecules are clustered in specialized domains of the PM (reviewed in Refs. 1Lisanti M. Scherer P. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M.

Low density membrane domains are likely to be present in all cell types and have been termed lipid rafts, detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched membranes, and detergent-resistant membranes. Caveolae, small nonclathrin-coated membrane invaginations, are likely to represent a specialized lipid raft with a characteristic protein coat of oligomerized caveolin (8Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar).Numerous signaling molecules are enriched in lipid raft preparations. Characterization of hormone-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in S49 lymphoma cells demonstrates that all components of the signaling pathway are enriched in low density PM fragments (9Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Morphological evidence is consistent with G-protein localization in subdomains of the plasma membrane. G-protein αi and β subunits exhibit a punctate distribution on the PM when visualized by immunofluorescence (9Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This nonuniform distribution of Gα in the PM is corroborated by its clustered appearance when detected by immunogold in electron micrographs (10Huang C. Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In T cells, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Fyn and Lck and the palmitoylated, transmembrane protein LAT are localized in lipid rafts. Activation of the T-cell receptor results in the recruitment of other components of this signaling pathway into rafts, including the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor, the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70, Vav, and phospholipase Cγ1 (reviewed in Ref. 11Resh M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar).The functional importance of organizing signaling pathways in PM subdomains has been demonstrated in several systems, most notably in hematopoietic cells. Transmembrane signaling through the high affinity IgE receptor FcεRI in mast cells requires a cholesterol-dependent association of the receptor with lipid rafts where the receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated by the NRTK lyn (12Holowka D. Baird B. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In T cells, perturbation of lipid rafts disrupts early steps in T cell activation (11Resh M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Examples can be found in other cell types as well (13Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol.

Using a variety of proteins as substrates, palmitoyltransferase activities have been characterized biochemically, but their molecular entities remain elusive. There is considerable heterogeneity in the protein motifs that direct palmitoylation. Furthermore, this modification occurs both on intracellular membranes and at the PM, suggesting that multiple enzymes are present in cells. We have studied a protein acyltransferase activity (PAT) using G-protein α subunits as a substrate (25Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38Dunphy J.T. Schroeder H. Leventis R. Greentree W.K. Knudsen J.K. Silvius J.R. Linder M.E. Biochim.

Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) where it facilitates the stable association of Gα with the PM (26Fishburn C. Pollitt S. Bourne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine how PAT is distributed in the PM to address whether it has a role in the localization of fatty acylated proteins in lipid rafts. We found that PAT is enriched in lipid raft preparations. Furthermore, we have reconstituted recruitment of Gα to these domains through a mechanism that requires PAT activity.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we examined the role of PAT in the distribution of Gαi in lipid rafts in the PM. We found that PAT activity for Gα is highly enriched in low density membranes, suggesting that it has an important functional role in targeting proteins to these domains. Indeed, we were able to selectively recruit palmitoylated Gαi to rafts in vitro, suggesting that PAT activity is a critical part of the mechanism by which its substrates are enriched in lipid rafts. We have proposed previously that palmitoylation serves as a targeting signal for PM localization of Gα subunits that are myristoylated and palmitoylated (24Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on the kinetic membrane-trapping model of Silvius and co-workers (35Shahinian S. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this model, a protein modified with a myristoyl group will cycle on and off membranes until it encounters a membrane where the protein is palmitoylated. Although a myristoyl group does not provide sufficient hydrophobicity for stable membrane association, two lipid modifications yield a protein that is “trapped” at the membrane. The model has been extended and refined by studies of the targeting of Gαz, a myristoylated, palmitoylated Gαsubunit. In this “dock and lock” modification, binding to Gβγ subunits targets Gα to the PM where palmitoylation then stabilizes Gα association with the PM (26Fishburn C. Pollitt S. Bourne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our current study extends this model further, suggesting that palmitoylation occurs in lipid rafts, trapping Gα in these subdomains.The temporal relationship between palmitoylation of G-protein α subunits and their localization in lipid rafts has not been studied in cells, but our data suggest that they would coincide. Interestingly, the NRTK Fyn is palmitoylated at the PM but does not acquire detergent resistance, a hallmark of raft localization, until 10–20 min later (36van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Resolution of this apparent discrepancy will require kinetic analysis of G-protein entry into detergent-resistant membranes and a better understanding of the substrate range of the PAT activity we have characterized.PAT may have an overlapping distribution with caveolin in subdomains of the plasma membrane, similar to that seen for Gα. Caveolin and Gα biochemically co-fractionate in low density membranes derived from a variety of cell types and tissues (2Anderson R.G.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Immunogold electron microscopy reveals that some Gα is associated with caveolae. However, most are clustered in irregular structures of the plasma membrane that have not been identified morphologically (9Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Recently Oh and Schnitzer (37Oh P. Schnitzer J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) reported that, in lung tissue and in endothelial and epithelial cultured cell lines, the heterotrimeric G-proteins Gi and Gs appear to be associated primarily with a lipid raft fraction distinct from caveolae, whereas Gqα is concentrated in caveolae (37Oh P. Schnitzer J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Future studies will be necessary to address whether PAT activity is associated with one or both types of plasma membrane subdomains.PAT activity partially redistributes to membranes of higher density when cholesterol is depleted, suggesting that its enrichment in rafts is dependent upon cholesterol. This is not surprising, because cholesterol is required for the integrity of lipid rafts. PAT activity can only be solubilized from bovine brain in a nonaggregated form with high concentrations of Triton X-100 (38Dunphy J.T. Schroeder H. Leventis R. Greentree W.K. Knudsen J.K. Silvius J.R. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or the ZWITTERGENT Z3–12. 2J. T. Dunphy, W. K. Greentree, and M. E. Linder, unpublished results. This resistance to detergent extraction is consistent with its localization in lipid rafts. PAT activity is stable in a detergent extract, but the preparation rapidly loses activity when fractionated through several chromatographic steps. The observation that PAT is inhibited when cholesterol is depleted suggests that cholesterol may be an important stabilizing factor for PAT. Chromatographic separation may remove lipids required for PAT activity. We have attempted to stabilize partially purified PAT with exogenously added cholesterol but have not been successful.2 Further investigation of the lipid requirements for PAT activity is warranted as specific lipids may be required to purify this elusive enzyme.The lipid environment of rafts may impact the lipid substrate availability for PAT. Raft membrane lipids are believed to exist in a state similar to the liquid-ordered phase described in model membranes (39Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2540) Google Scholar, 40Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In this state, lipid acyl chains are tightly packed, highly ordered, and extended, an environment that favors saturated acyl chains. Proteins modified with saturated acyl chains would be expected to partition favorably into liquid-ordered phase domains. In support of this model, proteins modified with saturated but not unsaturated fatty acids associate with detergent-resistant membranes in cells (23Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and in model membranes (41Moffett S. Brown D.A. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2191-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In vitro, PAT uses acyl-CoAs with saturated or unsaturated acyl chains as substrates (25Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 42Berthiaume L. Resh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22399-22405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the finding that raft proteins are modified with saturated fatty acids suggests that the pool of acyl-CoAs available to PAT may be enriched in species with saturated acyl chains.In addition to its ability to recruit Gα directly into rafts, the localization of PAT in these domains may have implications for regulation of Gα by palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is dynamic, thus PAT must be available for regeneration of palmitoylated Gα after palmitate turnover. The co-distribution of PAT and its substrates in lipid rafts would facilitate repalmitoylation. Agonists stimulate palmitate turnover on Gαs and Gαi, and this may have a regulatory role in desensitization of G-protein responses (43Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23769-23772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Manning D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23516-23522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In vitro, palmitoylated Gαi is resistant to deactivation by RGS proteins (47Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, agonist-stimulated depalmitoylation may permit RGS proteins to stimulate GTPase activity of Gα, thereby accelerating deactivation of the pathway. Repalmitoylation by PAT would return Gα to the RGS-resistant state. Interestingly, analysis of agonist-stimulated palmitate turnover on Gαs has revealed that there is no net change in the stoichiometry of palmitoylation. These results suggest that Gαs is rapidly repalmitoylated (48Jones T.L. Degtyarev M.Y. Backlund Jr., P.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7185-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), consistent with the close proximity of PAT with its substrates in lipid rafts.In summary, we have demonstrated that PAT activity for G-protein α subunits is enriched in low density membrane domains of the plasma membrane. Similar to other raft proteins, PAT's activity in low density membranes is dependent upon cholesterol. In a cell-free system, PAT can recruit exogenously added G-protein to these domains, suggesting that PAT is responsible at least in part for the localization of G-proteins in lipid rafts. Efficient transmission of extracellular signals relies on the localization of signaling molecules at the plasma membrane (PM).1 Signal transducers such as nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NRTK) and heterotrimeric G proteins are positioned at the inner leaflet of the PM to respond to receptor-generated signals and relay them to intracellular effectors. Increasing evidence indicates that signaling molecules are clustered in specialized domains of the PM (reviewed in Refs. 1Lisanti M. Scherer P. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 2Anderson R.G.W. Ann. Rev.

These domains have been characterized biochemically as regions that are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (4Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 5Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar), are insoluble in Triton X-100, and exhibit unique buoyancy with respect to other cellular membranes (5Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 6Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Low density membrane domains are likely to be present in all cell types and have been termed lipid rafts, detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched membranes, and detergent-resistant membranes. Caveolae, small nonclathrin-coated membrane invaginations, are likely to represent a specialized lipid raft with a characteristic protein coat of oligomerized caveolin (8Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Numerous signaling molecules are enriched in lipid raft preparations. Characterization of hormone-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in S49 lymphoma cells demonstrates that all components of the signaling pathway are enriched in low density PM fragments (9Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Morphological evidence is consistent with G-protein localization in subdomains of the plasma membrane. G-protein αi and β subunits exhibit a punctate distribution on the PM when visualized by immunofluorescence (9Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This nonuniform distribution of Gα in the PM is corroborated by its clustered appearance when detected by immunogold in electron micrographs (10Huang C. Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In T cells, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Fyn and Lck and the palmitoylated, transmembrane protein LAT are localized in lipid rafts. Activation of the T-cell receptor results in the recruitment of other components of this signaling pathway into rafts, including the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor, the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70, Vav, and phospholipase Cγ1 (reviewed in Ref. 11Resh M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). The functional importance of organizing signaling pathways in PM subdomains has been demonstrated in several systems, most notably in hematopoietic cells. Transmembrane signaling through the high affinity IgE receptor FcεRI in mast cells requires a cholesterol-dependent association of the receptor with lipid rafts where the receptor is tyrosine-phosphorylated by the NRTK lyn (12Holowka D. Baird B. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In T cells, perturbation of lipid rafts disrupts early steps in T cell activation (11Resh M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Examples can be found in other cell types as well (13Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 14Green J. Zhelesnyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F. Sarfatei M. Frazier W. Brown E. J.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting that concentration of proteins in cholesterol-rich domains may be a common feature required for the function of many signaling pathways. The best-characterized signals that target proteins to lipid rafts are those that involve fatty acylation. These are glycophosphatidylinositols (16Arreaza G. Brown D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23641-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell.

Samelson L. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) and influenza hemagglutinin (22Melkonian K.A. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) is also an important determinant of their raft association. Blocking palmitoylation of NRTKs by mutation (19Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) or with inhibitors such as 2-bromopalmitate results in the delocalization of NRTKs from lipid rafts (23Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Proteins are modified with palmitate by membrane-bound palmitoyltransferases (reviewed in Refs. 11Resh M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 24Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Using a variety of proteins as substrates, palmitoyltransferase activities have been characterized biochemically, but their molecular entities remain elusive. There is considerable heterogeneity in the protein motifs that direct palmitoylation. Furthermore, this modification occurs both on intracellular membranes and at the PM, suggesting that multiple enzymes are present in cells. We have studied a protein acyltransferase activity (PAT) using G-protein α subunits as a substrate (25Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38Dunphy J.T. Schroeder H. Leventis R. Greentree W.K. Knudsen J.K. Silvius J.R. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PAT activity for myristoylated Gα subunits is highly enriched in the PM (25Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) where it facilitates the stable association of Gα with the PM (26Fishburn C. Pollitt S. Bourne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to determine how PAT is distributed in the PM to address whether it has a role in the localization of fatty acylated proteins in lipid rafts. We found that PAT is enriched in lipid raft preparations. Furthermore, we have reconstituted recruitment of Gα to these domains through a mechanism that requires PAT activity. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we examined the role of PAT in the distribution of Gαi in lipid rafts in the PM. We found that PAT activity for Gα is highly enriched in low density membranes, suggesting that it has an important functional role in targeting proteins to these domains. Indeed, we were able to selectively recruit palmitoylated Gαi to rafts in vitro, suggesting that PAT activity is a critical part of the mechanism by which its substrates are enriched in lipid rafts. We have proposed previously that palmitoylation serves as a targeting signal for PM localization of Gα subunits that are myristoylated and palmitoylated (24Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on the kinetic membrane-trapping model of Silvius and co-workers (35Shahinian S. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In this model, a protein modified with a myristoyl group will cycle on and off membranes until it encounters a membrane where the protein is palmitoylated. Although a myristoyl group does not provide sufficient hydrophobicity for stable membrane association, two lipid modifications yield a protein that is “trapped” at the membrane. The model has been extended and refined by studies of the targeting of Gαz, a myristoylated, palmitoylated Gαsubunit. In this “dock and lock” modification, binding to Gβγ subunits targets Gα to the PM where palmitoylation then stabilizes Gα association with the PM (26Fishburn C. Pollitt S. Bourne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our current study extends this model further, suggesting that palmitoylation occurs in lipid rafts, trapping Gα in these subdomains.The temporal relationship between palmitoylation of G-protein α subunits and their localization in lipid rafts has not been studied in cells, but our data suggest that they would coincide. Interestingly, the NRTK Fyn is palmitoylated at the PM but does not acquire detergent resistance, a hallmark of raft localization, until 10–20 min later (36van't Hof W. Resh M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Resolution of this apparent discrepancy will require kinetic analysis of G-protein entry into detergent-resistant membranes and a better understanding of the substrate range of the PAT activity we have characterized.PAT may have an overlapping distribution with caveolin in subdomains of the plasma membrane, similar to that seen for Gα. Caveolin and Gα biochemically co-fractionate in low density membranes derived from a variety of cell types and tissues (2Anderson R.G.W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Immunogold electron microscopy reveals that some Gα is associated with caveolae. However, most are clustered in irregular structures of the plasma membrane that have not been identified morphologically (9Huang C. Hepler J.R. Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. Mumby S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Recently Oh and Schnitzer (37Oh P. Schnitzer J. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) reported that, in lung tissue and in endothelial and epithelial cultured cell lines, the heterotrimeric G-proteins Gi and Gs appear to be associated primarily with a lipid raft fraction distinct from caveolae, whereas Gqα is concentrated in caveolae (37Oh P. Schnitzer J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Future studies will be necessary to address whether PAT activity is associated with one or both types of plasma membrane subdomains. PAT activity partially redistributes to membranes of higher density when cholesterol is depleted, suggesting that its enrichment in rafts is dependent upon cholesterol. This is not surprising, because cholesterol is required for the integrity of lipid rafts. PAT activity can only be solubilized from bovine brain in a nonaggregated form with high concentrations of Triton X-100 (38Dunphy J.T. Schroeder H. Leventis R. Greentree W.K. Knudsen J.K. Silvius J.R. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or the ZWITTERGENT Z3–12. 2J. T. Dunphy, W. K. Greentree, and M. E. Linder, unpublished results. This resistance to detergent extraction is consistent with its localization in lipid rafts. PAT activity is stable in a detergent extract, but the preparation rapidly loses activity when fractionated through several chromatographic steps. The observation that PAT is inhibited when cholesterol is depleted suggests that cholesterol may be an important stabilizing factor for PAT. Chromatographic separation may remove lipids required for PAT activity. We have attempted to stabilize partially purified PAT with exogenously added cholesterol but have not been successful.2 Further investigation of the lipid requirements for PAT activity is warranted as specific lipids may be required to purify this elusive enzyme. The lipid environment of rafts may impact the lipid substrate availability for PAT. Raft membrane lipids are believed to exist in a state similar to the liquid-ordered phase described in model membranes (39Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2540) Google Scholar, 40Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12130-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In this state, lipid acyl chains are tightly packed, highly ordered, and extended, an environment that favors saturated acyl chains. Proteins modified with saturated acyl chains would be expected to partition favorably into liquid-ordered phase domains. In support of this model, proteins modified with saturated but not unsaturated fatty acids associate with detergent-resistant membranes in cells (23Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and in model membranes (41Moffett S. Brown D.A. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2191-2198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In vitro, PAT uses acyl-CoAs with saturated or unsaturated acyl chains as substrates (25Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7154-7159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 42Berthiaume L. Resh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22399-22405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the finding that raft proteins are modified with saturated fatty acids suggests that the pool of acyl-CoAs available to PAT may be enriched in species with saturated acyl chains. In addition to its ability to recruit Gα directly into rafts, the localization of PAT in these domains may have implications for regulation of Gα by palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is dynamic, thus PAT must be available for regeneration of palmitoylated Gα after palmitate turnover. The co-distribution of PAT and its substrates in lipid rafts would facilitate repalmitoylation. Agonists stimulate palmitate turnover on Gαs and Gαi, and this may have a regulatory role in desensitization of G-protein responses (43Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23769-23772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Mumby S.M. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Manning D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23516-23522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In vitro, palmitoylated Gαi is resistant to deactivation by RGS proteins (47Tu Y. Wang J. Ross E.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, agonist-stimulated depalmitoylation may permit RGS proteins to stimulate GTPase activity of Gα, thereby accelerating deactivation of the pathway. Repalmitoylation by PAT would return Gα to the RGS-resistant state. Interestingly, analysis of agonist-stimulated palmitate turnover on Gαs has revealed that there is no net change in the stoichiometry of palmitoylation. These results suggest that Gαs is rapidly repalmitoylated (48Jones T.L. Degtyarev M.Y. Backlund Jr., P.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7185-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), consistent with the close proximity of PAT with its substrates in lipid rafts. In summary, we have demonstrated that PAT activity for G-protein α subunits is enriched in low density membrane domains of the plasma membrane. Similar to other raft proteins, PAT's activity in low density membranes is dependent upon cholesterol. In a cell-free system, PAT can recruit exogenously added G-protein to these domains, suggesting that PAT is responsible at least in part for the localization of G-proteins in lipid rafts.

https://openalex.org/W2115658170,"HER3 (also known as c-Erb-b3) is a type I receptor tyrosine kinase similar in sequence to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. The extracellular segment of this transmembrane receptor contains four domains. Domains I and II are similar in sequence to domains III and IV, respectively, and domains II and IV are cysteine-rich. We show that the EGF-like domain of heregulin (hrg) binds to domains I and II of HER3, in contrast to the EGF receptor, for which prior studies have shown that a construct consisting of domains III and portions of domain IV binds EGF. Next, we identified a putative hrg binding site by limited proteolysis of the recombinant extracellular domains of HER3 (HER3-ECDI–IV) in both the presence and absence of hrg. In the absence of hrg, HER3-ECDI–IV is cleaved after position Tyr50, near the beginning of domain I. Binding of hrg to HER3-ECDI–IV fully protects position Tyr50from proteolysis. To confirm that domain I contains a hrg binding site, we expressed domains I and II (HER3-ECDI-II) and find that it binds hrg with 68 nm affinity. These data suggest that domains I and II of HER3-ECDI–IV act as a functional unit in folding and binding of hrg. Thus, our biochemical findings reinforce the structural hypothesis of others that HER3-ECDI–IV is similar to the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), as follows: 1) The protected cleavage site in HER3-ECDI–IVcorresponds to a binding footprint in domain I of IGF-1R; 2) HER3-ECDI-II binds hrg with a 68 nmdissociation constant, supporting the hypothesis that domain I is involved in ligand binding; and 3) the large accessible surface area (1749 Å) of domain L1 of IGF-1R that is buried by domain S1, as well as the presence of conserved contacts in this interface of type 1 RTKs, suggests that domains L1 and S1 of IGF-1R function as a unit as observed for HER3-ECDI-II. Our results are consistent with the proposal that HER3 has a structure similar to IGF-1R and binds ligand at a site in corresponding domains.

The HER2/neu receptor is amplified and overexpressed in 25–30% of human breast and 8–11% of human ovarian cancers.

The HER2/HER3 heterodimer forms a high affinity heregulin receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. Heregulin binding to cells that display the HER2/HER3 heterodimer causes a mitogenic response both in vitro and in vivo, so understanding this interaction is of medical importance (13Aguilar Z. Akita R.W. Finn R.S. Ramos B.L. Pegram M.D. Kabbinavar F.F. Pietras R.J. Pisacane P. Sliwkowski M.X. Slamon D.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6050-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The type I RTKs contain four extracellular domains, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain (14Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4593) Google Scholar). HER2/neu is a very active tyrosine kinase, but cells expressing HER2/neu alone, and not other members of the EGFR family, fail to bind heregulin. Conversely, the HER3 receptor binds heregulin but has low tyrosine kinase activity (15Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As mentioned above, the HER2/HER3 heterodimer is a high affinity heregulin binding complex with signaling activity through the HER-2 kinase domain. To date, the domains of HER3 involved in ligand binding and heterodimerization have not been identified. Thus far, the high carbohydrate content (17Horan T. Wen J. Arakawa T. Liu N. Brankow D. Hu S.

The extracellular domains (ECDs) of the type I RTKs have been divided into four domains: I, II, III, and IV, based on sequence analysis (18Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Domains II and IV are cysteine-rich and are similar in sequence. Domains I and III also have sequence similarity (18Yarden Y. Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar, 19Lax I. Johnson A. Howk R. Sap J. Bellot F. Winkler M. Ullrich A. Vennstrom B. Schlessinger J. Givol D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Little is known about the specific function of each domain except in EGFR, where several lines of evidence suggest that the major determinants for EGF binding lie in domain III. These lines of evidence include the following: 1) the exchange of domain III in chicken EGFR for domain III from human EGFR confers binding of human EGF (20Lax I. Bellot F. Howk R. Ullrich A. Givol D. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Lax I. Fischer R. Ng C. Segre J. Ullrich A. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); 2) monoclonal antibodies that recognize residues in domain III prevent EGF binding to EGFR (22Wu D.G. Wang L.H. Sato G.H.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17469-17475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 3) cross-linking of EGF to EGFR identified residues in domain III (23Summerfield A.E. Hudnall A.K. Lukas T.J. Guyer C.A.

A. 1990; 87: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); and 4) limited proteolysis of the ECD of EGFR produced a fragment that encompassed domain III, which bound transforming growth factor, with the observation that binding could be enhanced by including portions of domain IV (25Kohda D. Odaka M. Lax I. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1976-1981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies from cross-linking experiments indicated that bound EGF is also close to tyrosine 101 in domain I of murine EGFR (26Woltjer R.L. Lukas T.J. Staros J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7801-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taken together, these experimental results suggest that domain I and III are close to the ligand-binding region in EGFR and that domain III contributes most of the binding. HER3 and EGFR have relatively high sequence identity (45% identity in the ECD) and belong to the same family of type 1 tyrosine kinase receptors; however, they bind a different subset of ligands and differ in preference for heterodimerization versus homodimerization (8Tzahar E.

In this study, we have carried out a limited proteolysis of the extracellular domains of HER3 in an attempt to identify regions in the four extracellular domains of HER3 (HER3-ECDI–IV) that are essential for heregulin binding. Soluble extracellular domains of recombinant HER3 (HER3-ECDI–IV) were purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells by the procedure of Kita et al. (30Kita Y. Tseng J. Horan T. Wen J. Philo J. Chang D.

The 60-residue EGF-like domain of human heregulin β1 (residues 177–237) (hrg), the binding-deficient heregulin mutant (NA5-hrg), and the thioredoxin-heregulin fusion with a C-terminal His and S-tag (trx-hrg) were generated and purified as described elsewhere (31Landgraf R. Pegram M. Slamon D.J. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3220-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). EGF was purchased from Sigma. Trypsin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (catalog number 15400–013 and lot numbers 12P6334 and 1023241) and Sigma (catalog number T-1426 and lot number 70K7661), which had been treated with tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone to remove chymotrypsin. 5.0 μl of (HER3-ECDI–IV) at 2.3 mg/ml in storage buffer (20 mm sodium acetate pH 5.5 and 40 mm sodium chloride), 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS): 136 mm NaCl, 2.68 mm KCl, 9.289 mm Na2HPO4, 1.969 mmKH2PO4), and 3.0 μl of trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.; catalog number 15400-013 and lot number 12P6334) at 5.0 mg/ml in 5.0 mm EDTA and 150 mm sodium chloride were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Digestion was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1.0 mm. 5.0 μl of the digested sample were added to 5.0 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer with and without 1.0 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (β-ME). These samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 10–15% Phast gel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized by Coomassie staining. Different sources of trypsin were compared, but the best results were obtained with tissue culture grade trypsin from Life Technologies, Inc., which may contain other proteases. HER3-ECDI–IV was titrated with hrg to determine the minimum amount required for complete protection of HER3-ECDI–IV from proteolysis. Hrg in PBS was incubated with HER3-ECDI–IV for 30 min at room temperature, followed by trypsin as described above. The final concentration of hrg in the digest ranged from 1.7 to 17 μm with a constant HER3-ECDI–IV concentration of 7.7 μm. These reaction mixtures were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE as described above. The proteolytic digest was repeated with NA5-hrg and EGF using a molar ratio of 1:1. HER3-ECDI–IV (1.4 μl) in storage buffer was incubated with 9.6 μl of hrg (6.6 μm in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. 4.0-μl aliquots of this mixture were run on a 10–15% Phast gel under native conditions. This assay was repeated for NA5-hrg, EGF, and proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IVunder the same conditions. The ability of proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV to bind hrg was analyzed by a pull-down assay. S-protein agarose (0.5 ml) (Novagen) was spun down and resuspended three times in PBS. Aliquots of 100 μl were spun again, and trx-hrg (600 nm) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (1 mg/ml) were added to the resin. After incubating 15 min at 4 °C, the resin was washed five times with PBS, and blocked again with BSA. The following samples were added to each aliquot of resin: HER3-ECDI–IV, proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV, HER3-ECDI–IV protected by hrg during proteolysis, and HER3-ECDI–IV incubated with trypsin deactivated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride prior to the proteolysis reaction. HER3-ECDI–IV was at 600 nm. BSA (1 mg/ml) was also added to each aliquot. Following a 15-min incubation at 4 °C, the resin was spun down and resuspended three times in PBS. Each aliquot of resin was then resuspended in PBS containing 1 μm hrg or PBS. After a 1-min incubation at 4 °C, the samples were spun down, and the supernatant was diluted with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1.0 mm β-ME. Each aliquot of resin was then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and visualized by Western blotting and chemiluminescence using a polyclonal antibody directed against the HER3-ECD (E38530; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) followed by incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen). The ability of HER3-ECDI-II to bind hrg was also evaluated in the pull-down assay in the same way, with the following exceptions. HER3-ECDI-II (600 nm) was added to the trx-hrx and control resins, and the individual samples were resuspended in the various competing ligands indicated in Fig. 5. HER3-ECDI-IIwas visualized by Western blotting and chemiluminescence using a monoclonal antibody directed against the V-5 epitope conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen). Proteolytically digested HER3-ECDI–IV was diluted with sample buffer containing β-ME and run on a 4–15% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Bio-Rad) as described above. The samples were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the fragments were visualized by Ponceau stain. Edman sequencing of excised bands was performed in the UCLA Protein Microsequencing Facility using a Porton-Beckman Gas Phase Sequencer, and the first 10 residues of each fragment were identified. HER3-ECDI–IV was proteolyzed in the presence of an equimolar amount of an antibody against the C-terminal V5 epitope for 30, 60, and 120 min. The C-terminal fragment was identified by Western blotting using an antibody against the C-terminal V5 epitope (Invitrogen). The molar concentrations of HER3-ECDI–IV, hrg, and NA5-hrg were determined by amino acid analysis at the UCLA Protein Microsequencing Facility. The samples were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 18 h under a vacuum in a nitrogen atmosphere. The hydrolysate was visualized with phenylisothiocyanate. The phenylisothiocyanate amino acids were analyzed on a reverse phase column (Novapak) using a sodium acetate-acetonitrile gradient (32Bidlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J.

We used MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry to measure the molecular mass of proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV and HER3-ECDI-II. The mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager RP machine (PerCeptive Biosystems, Framingham, Massachusetts) with BSA as an internal standard. 0.3 μl of HER3-ECDI–IV(2.3 mg/ml) in 20 mm sodium acetate pH 5.5, 40 mm sodium chloride was mixed with 0.5 μl of 10 mg/ml sinapinic acid in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoracetate and dried on the MALDI plate. The digests (plus and minus hrg) of HER3-ECDI–IV were prepared in the same way, except that the sample was taken directly from the digest reaction after 1 h of incubation time. The digests were run under oxidizing and reducing conditions. The digests were reduced by the addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol prior to mixing the sample with the matrix. The molecular mass of HER3-ECDI-II (12 μm) in PBS was measured under the same conditions. An initial multiple sequence alignment was performed with the GCG program Pileup (Wisconsin Package, SeqLab, SeqWeb) using the Blossum 62 matrix (34Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4284) Google Scholar). Empirical observations of the N terminus were used in conjunction with the initial alignment to produce a final alignment. We used the GCG program Bestfit (Wisconsin Package, SeqLab, SeqWeb) (35Smith T. Waterman M. Adv. Appl. Math. 1981; 2: 482-489Crossref Scopus (565) Google Scholar) to find the segment of greatest similarity between two sequences. The amount of solvent-exposed surface area of domain L1 that is buried by domain S1 of IGF-1R was calculated using the GCG program Areaimol (36Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5317) Google Scholar, 37Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). The HER3 cDNA was amplified from the pJTH3 plasmid provided by Amgen, using the N-terminal primer (CTA GTC TCT AGA TCC GAG GTG GGC AAC TCT) and C-terminal primer (TAC CGA TCT AGA TTT CGG ACA GAG ACC CCC). Following amplification, HER3-ECDI-II (residues 20–329) was cloned into the BglII and XbaI site of the pMT/BiP/V5-His-A expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This vector contains an N-terminal Drosophila leader sequence and C-terminal His tag and V5 epitope tags. S2 cells were co-transfected with the vector containing HER3-ECDI-II and the pCoHYGRO vector (Invitrogen), which provides hygromycin resistance. We obtained a stable cell line after 3 weeks of selection with 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). Five liters of S2 medium (Sigma) with 1% fetal bovine serum were inoculated with S2 cells and grown to a cell density of 5 × 106 in a spinner flask (Bellco) and then induced for 3 days at room temperature with 500 μmCuSO4. HER3-ECDI-II was secreted to the medium. We used an ammonium sulfate cut (80%, w/v) to precipitate the protein from the medium. The pellet was resolubilized in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1.5 mNaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20. The solution was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole and then purified on a 5-ml Amersham Pharmacia Biotech “HITRAP Chelating” column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), loaded with NiSO4. Following elution from the column, the protein was dialyzed into 20 mm sodium potassium phosphate, pH 10. The protein was loaded onto an anion exchange column (Bio-Rad), and pure HER3-ECDI-II was collected from the flow-through. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a TosoHaas G3000SWXL column, followed by light scattering on a miniDAWN three-angle light-scattering instrument (Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA). Data analysis was carried out using ASTRA software. HER3-ECDI-II (112 μm) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, was injected onto the column at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The refractive index increment (d n/d c) for the protein portion of the HER3-ECDI-II in this buffer was assumed to be equal to that of monomeric BSA (Sigma) (d n/d c = 0.181 cm3/g). The carbohydrate d n/d ccontribution was estimated to be 0.157 cm3/g and was integrated into the final d n/d c (0.180 cm3/g) proportionally. Calculated extinction coefficients uncorrected for folding effect were used. The error to noise in the light scatter data is about ±3%. An error in the assumed extinction coefficient would result in a proportional error in the calculated molecular mass. Sedimentation equilibrium was performed at 4 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using absorption optics at 280 nm. A 12-mm path length six-sector cell was used to measure protein samples at initial A280 values of 0.15, 0.35, and 0.75. All samples were in PBS. Sedimentation equilibrium profiles were measured at 12,000 and 15,000 rpm. The data were initially fitted with a nonlinear least-squares exponential fit for a single ideal species using Origin (version 3.01). Since no concentration or speed dependence of the molecular weight was apparent, the Beckman global analysis software (the “multifit” option of the above mentioned software) was used to analyze all six scans simultaneously. A partial specific volume of 0.712 calculated from the amino acid composition and corrected to 4 °C was used (38Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar, 39Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J.

Trx-hrg (13 μm) in MES buffer (100 mm pH 6.0) was immobilized on a BIAcore CM5 chip using standard N-hydroxysuccinimide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide amine-coupling chemistry. The surface of the chip was blocked with ethanolamine and could be regenerated with 5.0 m NaCl and washes with running buffer (PBS + surfactant). HER3-ECDI-II (filtered through a 0.1-μm filter unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA)) in running buffer was applied to the chip at various concentrations (in triplicate) to determine the dissociation constant. Data were analyzed with the BIAevaluation software. Competition experiments were carried out using hrg at an equimolar concentration to HER3-ECDI-II. First, we digested HER3-ECDI–IV to learn if limited proteolysis leads to a fragment still capable of binding hrg. This results in two principal fragments (Fig.1 A, lane 3) with apparent molecular masses of 24 kDa (fragment 1) and 54 kDa (fragment 2), compared with an apparent molecular mass for the nonproteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV of 80 kDa. Gel electrophoresis of the proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV in the absence of a reducing agent shows that the two fragments remain linked by disulfide bonds (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Fragment 2 was identified as the C-terminal fragment by Western blot using the V5 C-terminal epitope-tagged HER3-ECDI–IV (Fig.1 B). To determine the effects of cleavage of HER3-ECDI–IV on its ability to bind hrg, a gel mobility shift assay was performed. In a native gel analysis, proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV (Fig.2 A, lane 2) shows an electrophoretic mobility similar to the nonproteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV (Fig. 2 A,lane 1). The nonproteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV shows a discrete shift in the presence of a 1:1 molar ratio of hrg to HER3-ECDI–IV (Fig.2 A, lane 3). The proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV does not shift its gel position in the presence of hrg (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). This finding suggests that the two disulfide-linked fragments, generated by proteolytic digestion (Fig. 1 A, lane 4) do not bind hrg. To check whether the proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV binds hrg, we used a pull-down assay under physiological salt conditions. In this analysis, we measured the HER3-ECDI–IV and proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV that could be dissociated from immobilized thioredoxin-heregulin (trx-hrg) by the addition of hrg. Using trx-hrg-coupled S-protein agarose, HER3-ECDI–IV was eluted with hrg (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). No proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV could be recovered by either elution with hrg (Fig. 2 B, lane 4) or detergent (Fig. 2 B, lane 7). However, HER3-ECDI–IV that was protected by hrg during proteolytic digestion could be recovered by detergent and competition with hrg (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 8). In addition, a trypsin preparation that was treated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride prior to the addition to the digestion reaction did not abolish hrg binding by HER3-ECDI–IV (Fig.2 B, lane 9). Based on these results, we conclude that the proteolyzed HER3-ECDI–IV does not bind hrg. The observation that proteolytic cleavage destroys the binding of HER3-ECDI–IV to hrg suggests that cleavage occurs at or near the binding site. This led us to investigate the proteolysis of HER3-ECDI–IV in the presence of hrg. The digestion of HER3-ECDI–IV in the presence of a molar excess of hrg (Fig. 3 A,lane 3) produces a different cleavage pattern than in the absence of hrg (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Complete protection of HER3-ECDI–IV was observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) at an approximate 1:1 molar ratio of hrg over HER3-ECDI–IV. Fragment 1 has a higher molecular weight in the presence of hrg (Fig.3 A, lane 3) than in its absence (Fig.3 A, lane 2), whereas the size of fragment 2 is apparently not affected by the presence of hrg (Fig.3 A, lanes 2–5). The cleavage that produces fragment 1 is apparently blocked by hrg but produces an additional, smaller fragment, which was not detected in the SDS gel of the digest of HER3-ECDI–IV. These data suggest that hrg protects HER3-ECDI–IV from the proteolytic cleavage that generates fragment 1. Taken together, these results suggest that there are at least two cleavage sites, one that is protected by hrg and another that is not. To localize the positions of the cleavage sites, we used N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. Fragment 1 begins at position 51 in the absence of hrg and at position 20 (the first residue in native HER3-ECDI–IV) in the presence of hrg (Fig.4). The N-terminal 31-residue fragment generated from the cleavage following residue 50 was not detected by SDS-PAGE or by mass spectrometry. The corresponding size by mass spectrometry of fragment 1 is 26.7 kDa in the absence of hrg and 30 kDa in the presence (Fig. 4). The difference in mass of fragment 1 in the presence and absence of hrg is 3270 daltons, which corresponds to the predicted size of 3216 daltons, based on the amino acid sequence of the missing fragment (Fig. 4). This suggests that the amino acid residues between positions 20 and 50 of HER3-ECDI–IV are not glycosylated. Based on these results, we conclude that hrg protects HER3-ECDI–IV from proteolysis at position 50. The cleavag"

FcεRI-induced degranulation is a SNARE (soluble N -ethylmaleimide attachment proteinreceptors)-dependent fusion process. It is regulated by Rab3D, a subfamily member of Rab GTPases. Evidence exists showing that Rab3 action is calcium-regulated although the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To obtain an understanding of Rab3D function we have searched for Rab3D-associated effectors that respond to allergic triggering through FcεRI. Using the RBL-2H3 mast cell line we detected a Ser/Thr kinase activity, termed here Rak3D (fromRab3D-associatedkinase), because it was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Rab3D antibody. Rak3D activity, as measured by its auto- or transphosphorylation, was maximal in resting cells and decreased upon stimulation. The down-regulation of the observed activity was blocked with EGTA, but not with other degranulation inhibitors, suggesting that its activity functions downstream of calcium influx. We found that Rak3D phosphorylates the NH2-terminal regulatory domain of the t-SNARE syntaxin 4, but not syntaxin 2 or 3. The phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 decreased its binding to its partner SNAP23.

A potent physiological stimulus for degranulation is the antigen-dependent aggregation of IgE bound to high affinity IgE receptors (FcεRI).1This activates both membrane-attached and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that pave the way for the intracellular calcium increase that is necessary for secretion (4Kim T.

The accumulated evidence demonstrates that during regulated exocytosis calcium can act directly on the molecular machinery involved in membrane fusion. An essential part of this machinery are SNARE proteins (7Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E.

During neurotransmitter release at the synapse, SNAREs assemble into an extremely stable multimeric core complex composed of one v-SNARE 2SNAREs were originally divided into t-SNAREs and v-SNAREs according to their target or vesicle membrane localization. A second terminology has been proposed to avoid ambiguity in the case of homotypic membrane fusion. Thus, t-SNAREs have been reclassified as Q-SNAREs (Glu-containing SNARES) and R-SNARES (Arg-containing SNAREs), based on the identity of a highly conserved residue.

Rab proteins regulate membrane traffic in eucaryotic cells by organizing the assembly of effector molecules (18Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

While many Rab proteins are ubiquitous, members of the Rab3 family are enriched in regulated-secretion-competent cells (11Gonzalez Jr., L. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12Darchen F. Goud B. Biochimie. 2000; 82: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). They are comprised of four isoforms (Rab3A, -B, -C, and -D). Rab3A, the best studied family member is abundantly expressed in brain and neuroendocrine cells. Absence of Rab3A in knock-out mice led to an enhancement of neurotransmitter release (21Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C. Südhof T. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Rab3A appeared to act at a late step as the pool of fusion-competent vesicles was unchanged. Its absence also interfered specifically with calcium-regulated fusion as triggering via a calcium-independent stimulus was not affected. Similar conclusions for the calcium-dependent action of Rab3 have been drawn from studies in adrenal chromaffin cells and Aplysiacholinergic neurons (22Doussau F. Clabecq A. Henry J.P. Darchen F. Poulain B. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3147-3157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Johannes L. Lledo P.M. Chameau P. Vincent J.D. Henry J.P. Darchen F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In mast cells, the predominant isoform is Rab3D, although Rab3A and Rab3B have also been detected (16Roa M. Paumet F.

Overexpression of WT Rab3D inhibited FcεRI-triggered degranulation, an effect that was enhanced with preferentially GTP-bound mutants (16Roa M. Paumet F. Le Mao J. David B. Blank U. J.

However, a molecular understanding of their function in conjunction with Rab3 has not been achieved. In the present study we report the discovery of a Rab3D-associated kinase activity in RBL-2H3 mast cells. The activity or possibly the association of this kinase, named here Rak3D, was calcium regulated. Rak3D specifically phosphorylates syntaxin 4 thus decreasing its capacity to bind SNAP23. Therefore, this kinase may provide the link between Rab3D and the calcium dependence of SNARE complex formation in regulated-secretion competent cells. RBL-2H3, COS-7, and C57 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Dastych, International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Poland) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Glutamax medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Eragny, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation with 30 μg of Rab3A-SRαneo, Rab3D-SRαneo, and Srαneo vectors, as previously described (16Roa M. Paumet F. Le Mao J. David B. Blank U. J.

F(ab′)2 fragment of peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and normal rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The pharmacological agents 4α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), wortmannin, EGTA, the kinase substrates myelin basic protein (MBP) and enolase, glutathione-Sepharose beads, as well as dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) were purchased from Sigma. Ionomycin and bisindolylmaleimide I were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Protein A beads were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Orsay, France). RBL-2H3 cells were either harvested by trypsinization or left adherent. For stimulation experiments, RBL-2H3 or C57 mast cells were sensitized at 1–2.5 × 106 cells/ml with DNP-specific-IgE (1:200) in complete medium containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, for 1 h at 37 °C. After a washing step, cells were resuspended in complete medium, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, and stimulated at 37 °C with 100 ng/ml DNP-HSA. The reaction was stopped by adding an excess of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (25 mm Pipes, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 1000 units/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (all from Alexis Inc., San Diego CA) at 5 × 107 cells/ml (nonadherent cells) or by directly adding 1 ml of lysis buffer to adherent cells before harvesting them by scraping. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 30 min and added to 5 μg of anti-Rab3D antibody or normal rabbit IgG prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads and immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed as above and washed additionally two times in kinase buffer (25 mm Pipes, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mmMnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100). IVK was performed in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Beads were washed two times and eluted in 2 × SDS sample buffer. When exogenous substrates were added, the reaction mixture was incubated in the presence of 10 μm substrate and following the IVK the total mixture was resolved after addition of SDS sample buffer without a further washing step. Quantitation of phosphorylated species was carried out on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant software. Anti-Rab3D or normal rabbit IgG immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing MBP (0.5 mg/ml). IGKA was performed as described (35Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Briefly, following electrophoresis, SDS was removed from the gel by repeated washings in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 20% propanol-2. Proteins were denaturated in 8 m urea 1 h at room temperature and renaturated overnight in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, containing 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.04% Tween 20. The kinase assay was carried out by incubating the gel for 1 h at room temperature in kinase buffer containing a mixture of 20 μm ATP and 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The gel was washed with a 5% trichloroacetic acid solution containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate and analyzed on a PhosphorImager. Proteins resolved on SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (anti-Rab3D at 1 μg/ml and anti-syntaxin 4 at 1/600 dilution). After several washes, peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgGs (1:30,000 dilution) were used as secondary antibodies and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Granule secretion of the marker β-hexosaminidase in the presence of pharmacological agents was analyzed as previously described (16Roa M. Paumet F. Le Mao J. David B. Blank U. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2815-2823PubMed Google Scholar). Pharmacological agents were added 15 min before stimulation and were kept during the 30-min stimulation period. The net percent inhibition was calculated in comparison to cells incubated in the presence of vehicle only. The cytoplasmic domains of rat syntaxin 24–265, syntaxin 34–263, and syntaxin 44–273 were expressed as GST fusion proteins using the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified as described (14Paumet F. Le Mao J. Martin S. Galli T. David B. Blank U. Roa M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5850-5857Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thrombin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France) was used to cleave GST from soluble recombinant syntaxin 4. Recombinant human GST-SNAP23 was a gift of Thierry Galli (Institut Curie, Paris, France). Deletion mutants of syntaxin 4 were generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification to obtain Ha- (aa 4–68), Ha/Hb- (aa 4–114), and Ha/Hb/Hc- (aa 4–166) domains fused to GST. Soluble recombinant syntaxin 4 (10 μm) was phosphorylated in an IVK by Rak3D present in anti-Rab3D immunoprecipitates (107 cell equivalents). For binding to recombinant GST-SNAP23, soluble phosphorylated S4 (0.3 μm) was mixed in 300 μl of kinase buffer with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing 2 μm GST-SNAP23. The mixture was incubated 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Beads were centifuged and the supernatant (unbound syntaxin 4) was recovered and an equal amount of 2 × SDS sample buffer was added. Beads were washed twice with 1 ml of kinase buffer and 60 μl of sample buffer was added to recover bound syntaxin 4. Samples (bound and free syntaxin 4) were boiled for 3 min and equal amounts of protein were simultaneously resolved on two separate SDS-PAGE. Gels were processed for PhosphorImager analysis or immunoblotting with anti-syntaxin 4 antibody. Quantitation of phosphorylated and immunoblotted syntaxin 4 species was carried out using ImageQuant and NIH Image software, respectively. No binding was detectable to two other GST fusion proteins (GST-VAMP3 and GST-VAMP8) in control experiments. RBL-2H3 cells were treated as described (36Adamczewski M. Paolini R. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18126-18132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 RBL-2H3 cells were incubated in phosphate-free medium for 3 h at 37 °C before addition of 1 μg/ml IgE for 1 h at 37 °C, then labeled with 330 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-free medium and stimulated with 100 ng/ml DNP-HSA for 5 min or left unstimulated. Ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline was added to stop stimulation and cells were lysed as described above. Syntaxin 4 and p72 syk were immunoprecipitated from stimulated and unstimulated cells. After separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer onto a nitrocelullose filter, the membrane was autoradiographed and subsequently blotted with anti-syntaxin 4. Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out according to a published procedure (37Ley S.C. Davies A.A. Druker B. Crumpton M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2203-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rab3D was immunoprecipitated and proteins were subjected to an IVK. The sample was run on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (HybondTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After a short autoradiography the portion corresponding to labeled species was excised. Bound protein was hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysate was dried, washed, and redissolved in acetic acid/pyridine/water (10:1:189, v:v:v). Phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards (3 μg of each) were dissolved in 2 μl of acetic acid/pyridine buffer. The phosphoamino acids were separated at 1600 V for 20 min on a cellulose TLC in the same buffer used to dissolve samples. Unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards were detected with ninhydrin and labeled amino acids were visualized by autoradiography. Several functional links between protein kinases and small GTPases have been demonstrated making the search for protein kinases as potential effectors of Rab3D particularly important. To identify such a putative protein kinase we first examined whether the antibody we generated to the Rab3D carboxyl-terminal divergent region could specifically immunoprecipitate the Rab3D isoform, as both Rab3A and Rab3D are expressed in RBL-2H3, the mast cell line used in these studies. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding Rab3A, Rab3D, or the empty expression vector. Cell lysates were prepared and proteins were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted using the anti-Rab3D antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 A,a band corresponding to the expected molecular mass of 27 kDa was only detected in the Rab3D-transfected cells demonstrating that our antibody could indeed immunoprecipitate Rab3D in a specific manner. We next examined whether immobilized Rab3D was associated with a protein kinase activity by performing an IVK. A phosphorylated molecular species of about 130 kDa (pp130) was consistently detected in anti-Rab3D immunoprecipitates but not in those immunoprecipitates where normal rabbit IgG was used (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether this phosphoprotein could represent a kinase, we first analyzed whether the kinase activity associated with Rab3D was able to phosphorylate enolase and MBP, which are generic substrates for protein tyrosine and Ser/Thr kinases, respectively. Fig. 2 Ashows that MBP was strongly phosphorylated in this assay while enolase remained unphosphorylated suggesting that the identified kinase activity corresponds to a Ser/Thr kinase. This was further confirmed by direct phosphoamino acid analysis that revealed that pp130 is phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues but not on Tyr (Fig. 2 B). The MBP protein was then used as a substrate in an IGKA to directly assay whether pp130 has by itself kinase activity. Fig. 2 Cshows the phosphorylated band that could be detected at a molecular mass of around 130 kDa. This suggests that the pp130 protein has itself kinase activity. Although this kinase activity appeared to be weak, when compared with IVK, denaturation, and renaturation of the kinase could likely affect the fraction of active kinase remaining in the IGKA. Indeed, as stronger exposures revealed a background activity in lanes of control IgG we quantitated the difference to Rab3D immunoprecipitates using PhosphorImager analysis, which was found to be more than 7-fold (see figure legend). Taken together, these results indicate that a Ser/Thr kinase of ∼130 kDa is associated with Rab3D that we refer to in the following as Rak3D.Figure 2Characterization of Rab3D-associated kinase activity. A, phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr kinase substrate MBP, but not the tyrosine kinase substrate enolase by a Rab3D-associated kinase activity. Rab3D was immunoprecipitated from lysates of resting RBL-2H3 cells (107 cells/sample). An IVK was performed in the presence of 10 μm enolase or MBP and [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed on a PhosphorImager. B, pp130 is phosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues. Following IVK pp130 was subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (PAA) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Labeled amino acids were visualized by autoradiography and compared with phosphoamino acid standards represented schematically. C, identification of the pp130 as the Rab3D-associated kinase (Rak3D) activity. Anti-Rab3D or normal rabbit IgG immunoprecipitates from lysates of resting RBL-2H3 cells were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE containing 10 μm MBP as a substrate. Separated proteins in the gel were renaturated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subjected to an IGKA in the presence of 20 μm ATP and 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. A labeled 130-kDa phosphoprotein (arrow) was detected after PhosphorImager analysis. Quantitation of the optical densities (arbitrary units) between normal IgG and anti-Rab3D in the p130 area by PhosphorImager analysis revealed a 7.4 ± 2.3 (mean ± S.D.) difference in three independent experiments (experiment 1 = 10.0; experiment 2 = 5.8, and experiment 3 = 6.8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Rab3D has been shown to inhibit mast cell degranulation stimulated via FcεRI (16Roa M.

Payan D.G. Scheller R.H. Fisher J.M. Cytometry. 1999; 36: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As the signaling pathways between the initial stimulation event and Rab3D are presently unknown we wished to analyze whether receptor triggering could affect the kinase activity associated with Rab3D. IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells were challenged with antigen for varying times and p130 autophosphorylation was determined. Fig.3 A shows a representative kinetic experiment as well as a quantitative analysis corresponding to several experiments. The highest level of p130 autophosphorylation was observed in resting cells. Interestingly, FcεRI engagement for a short time (3 min) led to a decrease in p130 autophosphorylation, which then progressively increased again over longer periods of stimulation. Similar results were obtained when we tested adherent RBL-2H3 cells or C57 mast cells that grow in suspension thus excluding an effect of trypsin treatment (data not shown). The capacity of the kinase to transphosphorylate MBP is similarly down-modulated by FcεRI engagement (Fig. 3 B). To examine whether the observed modulation of Rak3D was an early receptor-dependent event, we stimulated cells with the calcium ionophore, iononomycin, and the PKC activator, PMA, to bypass receptor-proximal events. The experiment shown in Fig. 3 C revealed that stimulation by PMA/ionomycin reproduced the kinetics observed upon stimulation through FcεRI suggesting that the observed modulation of Rak3D is downstream of PKC- and calcium-activated signals. PMA alone did not reproduce the same kinetics (data not shown) indicating a calcium regulatory step. An additional approach based on the use of pharmacological inhibitors was undertaken to examine potential signals involved in the modulation of Rak3D. RBL-2H3 cells were incubated in the presence of EGTA, which blocks calcium influx, bisindolylmaleimide I, a broad spectrum inhibitor of PKC (38Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 3 D, only EGTA treatment abolished the observed decrease of detectable Rak3D activity following FcεRI triggering although all pharmacological agents were nonpermissive for degranulation at the applied doses. Altogether, these results are in favor of a calcium-dependent modulation of Rak3D. One of the proposed roles for Rab3 proteins is the calcium-dependent regulation of membrane fusion. However, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. As we found that Rak3D was calcium-regulated it was of interest to determine whether it could directly"

Using hydroxyl radical protection analyses to establish the location of ComK dimer-binding sites within the recA promoter, we identified four AT-boxes in a configuration unique for ComK-regulated promoters. Gel mobility shift experiments showed that all four ComK dimer-binding sites were occupied at ComK concentrations in the physiological range. In addition, occupation of all ComK-binding sites did not prevent LexA from binding to the recA promoter, despite the fact that the ComK and LexA recognition motifs partially overlap.

Paramount among the recombination gene products that enable cells to incorporate newly acquired genetic material is the RecA protein, which plays a crucial role in recombination by promoting homologous pairing and DNA strand exchange (1Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lovett C.M. Roberts J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3305-3313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RecA is also essential for the regulation of the SOS DNA repair system, which is activated when DNA is damaged or whenB. subtilis cells differentiate to a competent state (3Yasbin R.E. Cheo D.L. Bayles K.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The SOS system operates in many bacteria and has been the subject of extensive studies in Escherichia coli (for review, see Ref.4Walker G.C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. American Society for Microbiology, Wahington, D. C.1996: 1400-1416Google Scholar). Following exposure to DNA damaging treatments, a set of damage inducible (din) genes becomes transcriptionally activated. Expression of B. subtilis din genes is regulated by the products of the lexA (formerly called dinR) andrecA genes (5Raymond-Denise A. Guillen N. J.

Analogous to the situation in E. coli, RecA is required for SOS induction in B. subtilis (6de Vos W.M. Venema G. Mol. Gen.

B. subtilis RecA is activated to promote the autocleavage of LexA repressor in vitro when it binds single-stranded DNA and nucleoside triphosphate (10Miller M.C. Resnick J.B. Smith B.T. Lovett C.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33502-33508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, B. subtilis RecA is activated in vivo by binding single-stranded DNA exposed by discontinuous replication past UV-induced lesions and to a lesser extent by the processing of gaps formed during excision repair (13Lovett C.M. O'Gara T.M. Woodruff J.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4914-4923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the SOS system is induced during competence development by a similar RecA/LexA-dependent mechanism, B. subtilis recA expression is additionally stimulated by a competence-specific mechanism (8Haijema B.J. van-Sinderen D.

Competence is a starvation-induced differentiation process that develops optimally at sufficiently high cell densities and in minimal growth medium with glucose as the main carbon source (for review, see Ref. 15Dubnau D. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993Google Scholar). The various environmental signals are interpreted by a complex signal transduction cascade and ultimately lead to the activation ofcomK, which encodes the competence transcription factor (16van-Sinderen D.

Microbiol. 1996; 21: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ComK is essential for: (i) the expression of all late competence gene products that assemble the DNA-binding and -uptake system; (ii) the competence-related expression of the recombination genesrecA and addAB (the homologue of E. coli recBCD); and (iii) its own expression (8Haijema B.J. van-Sinderen D.

Since competence-dependent recA induction occurs in RecA-minus cells, deficient in LexA cleavage, and before LexA is cleaved in wild-type cells, 2B. Chaudhuri and C. M. Lovett, unpublished results. the LexA-imposed transcriptional repression of recA is presumably alleviated by the activity of ComK (14Lovett C.M. Love P.E. Yasbin R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2318-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether ComK is able to prevent the association of LexA with therecA promoter region, we analyzed the binding of purified ComK in the absence and presence of LexA. Hydroxyl radical footprinting analysis revealed four possible ComK dimer-binding sites, which was substantiated by the results of gel mobility shift experiments. Surprisingly, the occupation of all ComK-binding sites did not interfere with LexA binding, yet our in vitro transcription analysis showed that ComK is sufficient to overcome LexA repression. All molecular cloning and PCR3 procedures were carried out using standard techniques (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidham J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

ComK was purified as an MBP-ComK fusion protein on an amylose resin (New England Biolabs) column and separated from MBP by cleavage with protease Factor Xa, as previously described (16van-Sinderen D. Luttinger A. Kong L. Dubnau D. Venema G. Hamoen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). After cleavage was complete, Factor Xa was inactivated by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To separate ComK from MBP and DNA, the protein mixture was loaded onto a DEAE column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiotreitol. MBP and ComK were sequentially eluted with a 0 to 50 mm Na2SO4 gradient and a 0 to 1 m KCl gradient (containing 50 mmNa2SO4). Fractions were collected and the Na2SO4 concentration increased to 100 mm to prevent precipitation of ComK. The ComK containing fractions were checked for the absence of contaminating DNA by ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel electrophoresis, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Purification and cleavage of MBP-ComK were followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. B. subtilis LexA was purified as described previously (10Miller M.C. Resnick J.B. Smith B.T.

E. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing pET21a-dinR was grown in 1 liter of LB broth containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) with shaking until anA600 of 0.6. The culture was induced with 10 ml of 100 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, 5000 × g for 20 min, and resuspended in 5 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed with lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) by incubation on ice for 30 min followed by a 15-min incubation at 37 °C. After 3 times freeze-thawing and sonication, debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was used for further purification. The supernatant (0.5–2 ml) was filtered and applied to a 5-ml heparin-agarose column, equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, and subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography. Following elution with a 40-ml linear NaCl gradient (10 mm to 1 m), fractions containing LexA protein were pooled, concentrated 10-fold by centrifugation in a Centricon 10 unit (Amicon), and diluted to the original volume in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmNaCl; concentration and dilution was then repeated twice. Sample was applied to a Mono-S column and chromatographed as described for the heparin-agarose column, and fractions containing LexA were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and concentrated by centrifugation in a Centricon 10 unit. Hydroxyl radical protection analyses were performed as described by Tullius and Dombroski (23Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) with the modifications described by O'Halloran et al. (24O'Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K. Ralston D.M. Wright J.G. Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The DNA probes were obtained by PCR amplification using primers R1 (5′-TACGGCTGCCATTTAATG-3′) and R2 (5′-CTGCCTGACGATCACTC-3′), complementary to the sequence at nucleotide position −184 and +32, relative to the transcriptional start of recA. Primers were end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. Binding reaction conditions were as for the gel mobility shift experiments described below, except that glycerol was omitted. DNA fragments, containing ∼30,000 cpm, were added to each 50-μl reaction mixture. After 20 min at room temperature, 1 μl of 5.6 mm(NH4)2Fe(SO2)2·6H2O was mixed with 1 μl of 11.2 mm EDTA, and added to the incubation mixture, followed by the addition of 2 μl of 3.36% H2O2 and 2 μl of 112 mmNa-ascorbate. Reactions were incubated for 1 min at room temperature and terminated with 44 μl of stop solution (10 μl of 3m Na-acetate, 6 μg of yeast tRNA, and 10 μl of 320 mm thiourea) and the subsequent addition of 300 μl of ethanol. Samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform, and ethanol precipitated. The precipitates were resuspended in 3 μl of loading buffer. Analysis of DNA products was carried out by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide urea gel. Maxam-Gilbert G + A reactions were run with each experiment to locate sequence positions and protected regions (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift experiments were carried out essentially as described (16van-Sinderen D. Luttinger A. Kong L. Dubnau D. Venema G. Hamoen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The recApromoter fragment was isolated by PCR, using the primer set as described for the hydroxyl radical protection analyses, and end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. The purified proteins and probes were premixed on ice in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiotreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After 15 min incubation at 37 °C, the samples were loaded on a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel. The following modifications were applied to increase the resolution of retardation. Electrophoresis was performed with the Bio-Rad Mini-protein cell system, using a spacer thickness of 0.75 mm. A voltage gradient stacking was established by using 1 × TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA) for the nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel, 0.5 × TAE buffer for the cathode compartment, and 2 × TAE buffer for the anode compartment. Gels were run at 50 V, dried, and autoradiographed in the absence of intensifying screens. Autoradiograms of the dried gels were digitized and analyzed by densitometry using an Alpha Innotech IS-1000 imaging system. To determine the fraction of DNA molecules with exactly idimers bound, Ø i (i = 0, 2, 3, or 4), the total OD of all bands in each lane was quantified. Ø i was calculated for each band from Ø i = ODtot, i /ΣODtot, i, summed over all of the bands in a given lane. The equations for the fractions of DNA molecules with i ligands bound in a three-site system have been derived previously using a general statistical mechanical approach (25Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our analyses we assumed that the three sites correspond to the binding of a tetramer first and then subsequently by two dimers such that the equations representing the number of dimers bound are given by, φ0=1/ZEq. 1 φ2=K1[ComK]/ZEq. 2 Ï†3=K2[ComK]2/ZEq. 3 Ï†4=K3[ComK]3/ZEq. 4 where Z = 1 + K1[ComK] + K2[ComK]2 +K3[ComK]3. Experimental data shown in Fig. 7 were analyzed according to EquationsEq. 1, Eq. 2, Eq. 3, Eq. 4 with Mathematica and KaleidaGraph using nonlinear least squares methods to determine and apply the best curve fits. In vitrotranscription experiments were performed essentially as described by Hamoen et al. (19Hamoen L.W. Van-Werkhoven A.F. Bijlsma J.J. Dubnau D. Venema G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The DNA template, pAN-recA, was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment containing the recApromoter, between the SmaI and XbaI sites of the pAN583 vector (26Predich M. Nair G. Smith I. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recA promoter fragment was isolated by PCR using the primers R1 and R3 (5′-TGTTCTAGAGCCATATCTAAGG-3′), and subsequent digestion with HindIII (position +49 relative to the transcriptional start of recA) and XbaI (underlined in R3). TheHindIII site was converted to a blunt-end by using a Klenow fill-in reaction, prior to XbaI digestion. The transcription reactions were performed in the binding buffer described for the gel mobility shift experiments (poly(dI-dC) included). DNA templates, purified B. subtilis RNA polymerase, and purified ComK were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 20 μl, before the addition of 3 μl of a nucleotide mixture (1 mm ATP, 1 mm UTP, 1 mm GTP, 0.5 μl of [α-32P]CTP). After 1 min incubation at room temperature, 2 μl of 0.3% heparin was added to the mixture and incubation resumed for another 10 min at 37 °C. After the addition of 2 μl of 1 mm CTP, incubation was continued for 10 min before terminating the reaction by the addition of 18 μl of formamide containing 0.05% bromphenol blue and 0.05% xylene blue. After heating for 3 min at 90 °C, the samples were loaded on a 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel and run at 300 V. Gels were subjected to autoradiography immediately after electrophoresis without prior drying. In a previous study Haijema et al. (8Haijema B.J. van-Sinderen D. Winterling K. Kooistra J. Venema G. Hamoen L.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) determined the ComK-binding site at the recA promoter using DNase I footprinting analysis (8Haijema B.J. van-Sinderen D. Winterling K. Kooistra J. Venema G. Hamoen L.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). They obtained a clear footprint extending from approximately positions −150 to −50, which is the longest ComK-protected region identified thus far. By analyzing ComK footprints of several ComK-dependent promoters, Hamoen et al. (19Hamoen L.W. Van-Werkhoven A.F. Bijlsma J.J. Dubnau D. Venema G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) concluded that ComK binds as a tetramer composed of two dimers, where each dimer recognizes the dyad symmetrical sequence AAAAN5TTTT, the so called AT-box (19Hamoen L.W. Van-Werkhoven A.F. Bijlsma J.J. Dubnau D. Venema G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The two putative AT-boxes in the recA promoter appeared to be located at the center of the DNase I protections, yet the region confined by these AT-boxes covers only half the sequence protected by ComK (19Hamoen L.W. Van-Werkhoven A.F. Bijlsma J.J. Dubnau D. Venema G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To examine which nucleotide sequences could be responsible for this peculiarly extended ComK-binding region, we improved the resolution of the ComK footprint analyses by using a hydroxyl radical protection assay (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig.2, the hydroxyl radical footprint fits well within the borders of the DNase I footprint. The central hydroxyl radical protections mark the two previously assigned AT-boxes in a pattern comparable with that found in a hydroxyl radical ComK footprint of the addAB promoter (19Hamoen L.W. Van-Werkhoven A.F. Bijlsma J.J. Dubnau D. Venema G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A closer inspection of the hydroxyl radical protections at the extremities of the ComK-binding region revealed two additional AT-boxes: a perfect AT-box around position −140, and one AT-box, with two replacements in the thymine tract, around position −55.Figure 2Summary of the ComK DNase I and ComK hydroxyl radical footprints of the recA promoter.Sequences protected from DNase I nuclease and hydroxyl radical activity are marked by bars and dots, respectively.Thin bars and small dots represent weak protection. Hypersensitive sites are indicated byarrowheads. AT-boxes are boxed, the SOS-box is marked with open bars, and the −35 promoter sequence isunderlined. Base pair positions are indicated relative to the transcriptional start site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The presence of four ComK-protected AT-boxes in the recApromoter suggests that this promoter is able to accommodate a total of four ComK dimers. Since it has been shown that ComK binds as a single tetramer to the promoter regions of the ComK-regulated genes studied so far (19Hamoen L.W. Van-Werkhoven A.F. Bijlsma J.J. Dubnau D. Venema G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining the oligomerization state of ComK on the recA promoter with its two additional dimer-binding sites. Specifically, we wondered if the detection of partial saturation of the recA promoter at low ComK concentrations might provide clues regarding the nature of ComK binding. Although previous gel mobility shift assays with therecA promoter and purified ComK yielded a single retarded band, the retarded band displayed in the autoradiograms was diffuse and may have obscured the presence of multiple bands (8Haijema B.J. van-Sinderen D. Winterling K. Kooistra J. Venema G. Hamoen L.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To increase the resolution of the gel mobility shifts we omitted the use of intensifying screens, reduced the thickness of the nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and applied a voltage gradient using buffers with various ionic strengths (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). These alterations resolved the single diffuse band into three separate bands (Fig. 3). Repeating these high resolution gel mobility shift assays with other ComK-regulated promoters, such as addAB and comK, yielded only a single retarded band (data not shown) consistent with the binding of a single ComK tetramer (19Hamoen L.W. Van-Werkhoven A.F. Bijlsma J.J. Dubnau D. Venema G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift experiments at low ComK concentrations with these ComK-regulated promoter fragments never revealed intermediate retarded bands that would correspond to the binding of discrete ComK dimers. Based on its relative mobility, we assume that the least retarded recAfragment is bound by a single ComK tetramer, and that the two further retarded bands are due to successive binding of two additional ComK dimers. The LexA-binding site of the recA promoter partially overlaps with the downstream AT-box (AT-box 4) suggesting that ComK binding to this AT-box could reduce the affinity of LexA for the recASOS-box. Thus, a plausible mechanism for competence-dependent recA induction could be that ComK precludes stable binding of LexA to its site. Arguing against this simple mechanism, Haijema et al. (8Haijema B.J. van-Sinderen D. Winterling K. Kooistra J. Venema G. Hamoen L.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed that both proteins can bind simultaneously to the recA promoter. However, it is possible that in the presence of LexA the downstream AT-box was not occupied (i.e. only three ComK dimers bound) since the unresolved mobility shift experiment could not distinguish between partial and complete occupancy of al ComK-binding sites. To examine whether ComK is capable of displacing LexA from therecA promoter, we repeated the high-resolution gel mobility shift assays with ComK in the presence of purified LexA. Prior to testing retardation with both proteins, we tested the binding of LexA alone to determine the saturating LexA concentration. TherecA promoter contains a single SOS-box, and only a single shifted band was observed in a gel mobility shift assay (Fig.4). Graphical analysis of these data gave a K d of 5 nm for LexA binding to therecA SOS-box (data not shown). Using a LexA concentration (13 nm) sufficient to ensure binding to all recApromoter molecules, we incubated the recA promoter with increasing concentrations of ComK in the absence and presence of LexA. As indicated in Fig. 5, the presence of LexA added to the electrophoretic mobility shift of all three ComK retarded bands. Apparently, despite partially overlapping recognition sites, ComK does not exclude LexA from binding to the recApromoter. The alternative possibility, that LexA-induced supershift resulted from a specific interaction between ComK and LexA, could be refuted. In a gel mobility shift assay with a ComK-dependent promoter which does not contain a SOS-box, the presence of LexA did not result in an additional retardation in electrophoretic mobility of ComK-bound promoter fragments (data not shown).Figure 5Gel mobility shift titration using32P-labeled recA promoter fragment incubated with increasing concentrations of ComK, in the presence (+) and absence of LexA (13 nm). ComK was increased in 2-fold increments from 7 to 900 nm. The left lane (0) contains no protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We quantified our mobility shift data by densitometry and analyzed the data graphically to determine equilibrium binding constants. Our objective was to assess the extent to which LexA alters the ability of ComK to bind the recA promoter. Any changes in ComK binding constants at saturating LexA concentration would suggest that saturating concentrations of ComK could alter the binding of LexA to the recA SOS-box. Fig. 6 shows graphical analyses of our ComK titration data in the absence and presence of LexA at a saturating concentration of 13 nm. Assuming the stoichiometry indicated by our footprinting data (i.e. a maximum occupancy of four ComK dimers per recA promoter), we analyzed the average number of ComK dimers bound per recA promoter as a function of free ComK concentration. The data for the binding of ComK in the presence and absence of LexA fit a binding isotherm with a dissociation constant, K d, of 84 nm. The value of 84 nm was determined from a Scatchard plot of the same data (Fig. 6, middle graph). It is noteworthy that the Scatchard plot is linear suggesting that the thermodynamics of binding is not cooperative despite the existence of multiple contiguous binding sites. Consistent with the linear Scatchard plots, Hill plots of the data (Fig. 6, lower graph) had slopes of exactly 1.0. These results do not rule out the possibility that the kinetics of ComK binding is cooperative, which we suspect is the case for binding of the ComK tetramer since we never detect binding of a single dimer. It is also possible that the kinetics of dimer binding is cooperative. In any case, the significant result is that the presence of LexA does not appear to affect the affinity of ComK for the recApromoter. Our ability to resolve different ligation states for ComK binding makes it possible to analyze individual binding constants to better assess cooperative interactions that might occur between sites. Senear and Brenowitz (25Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described above, our gel mobility shift results can best be explained by a three-site system where one site is bound by a ComK tetramer and the other two sites are bound by ComK dimers.

TRAIL mRNA was found in a variety of tissues, in particular in activated T cells, and is often induced by interferons (1Wang Q. Ji Y. Wang X. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TRAIL interacts with five different members of the TNF receptor superfamily: TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5/TRICK2/Killer, TRAIL-R3/TRID/DcR1/LIT, TRAIL-R4/TRUNDD/DcR2 and osteoprotegerin (2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 contain a death domain and mediate the apoptotic response toward TRAIL. TRAIL-R3, lacking a cytoplasmic domain, is anchored to the cell surface by modification with glycophospholipids and is regarded as a decoy receptor for TRAIL. TRAIL-R4 has an incomplete cytoplasmic death domain and is therefore incapable of signaling apoptosis but is still able to activate the antiapoptotic NF-κB pathway. Thus, TRAIL-R4 is maybe involved in regulation of the apoptotic TRAIL response at the cellular level. The soluble receptor osteoprotegerin, which otherwise has a critical role in regulation of osteoclastogenesis, may act as a systemic negative regulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis (1Wang Q. Ji Y.

Inhibition of endogenous TRAIL enhances proliferation of autoreactive lymphocytes or synovial cells, thereby contributing to the exacerbation of arthritic inflammation and joint tissue destruction (10Song K. Chen Y. Goke R. Wilmen A. Seidel C. Goke A. Hilliard B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These data argue for an in vivofunction of TRAIL in the maintenance of immune homeostasis by counteracting autoimmune responses. However, in contrast to FasL, TRAIL inhibits autoimmune inflammation by inhibition of cell cycle progression instead of induction of T cell apoptosis (10Song K. Chen Y. Goke R. Wilmen A. Seidel C. Goke A. Hilliard B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In accordance with its remarkable tumoricidal activity in vitro, several studies point to a role of TRAIL in anti-tumoral immunity. In this regard, it has been recently shown that TRAIL is the sole principle mediating antitumorigenic activity of interferon-activated human monocytes (11Griffith T.S. Wiley S.R. Kubin M.Z. Sedger L.M. Maliszewski C.R. Fanger N.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1343-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Moreover, up-regulation of TRAIL plays a central role in IFNγ-mediated antimetastatic effects of interleukin-12 and α-galactosylceramide (12Takeda K. Hayakawa Y. Smyth M.J. Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N.

Further, aside from the capability of dendritic cells to acquire antigen from apoptotic cells to cross-present these antigens to cytotoxic T cells (14Albert M.L. Sauter B. Bhardwaj N. Nature. 1998; 392: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar, 15Albert M.L. Pearce S.F. Francisco L.M. Sauter B. Roy P. Silverstein R.L. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), dendritic cells directly mediate cellular apoptosis via TRAIL after stimulation with IFNα or IFNγ (5Fanger N.A. Maliszewski C.R. Schooley K. Griffith T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Of interest, a recent study indicates that type I IFNs induce the rapid maturation of monocytes into short-lived TRAIL-expressing dendritic cells (16Santini S.M. Lapenta C. Logozzi M. Parlato S. Spada M. Di Pucchio T. Belardelli F. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Moreover, type I IFNs up-regulate TRAIL expression on anti-CD3-stimulated human peripheral blood T cells suggesting that TRAIL contributes to the indirect cytotoxic activity of type I IFNs used in cancer therapy for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemias and renal cell carcinomas (17Kayagaki N.

Both TNF and PMA/I induced up-regulation of TRAIL mRNA but with clearly distinct kinetics (Fig. 1 A). While TNF-induced half-maximal TRAIL expression already after 1 h and reached a plateau after 3 h (Fig. 1 A, right panel), TRAIL induction by PMA/I was delayed for several hours and reached maximum levels after 15 h (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Similarly delayed kinetics of TRAIL induction was also found in DII/23–7 T-cells (Fig. 1 B). There was no evidence for an up-regulation of TRAIL in the B cell lines BJAB and Raji suggesting that TRAIL up-regulation by TNF and PMA/I is cell type-specific (Fig. 1 C). PMA/I and TNF showed a capacity to induce TRAIL expression in the same range as the well established TRAIL inducers IFNα/β/γ (Fig. 1 D). In all cases two protected TRAIL-specific fragments of slightly different sizes were obtained, suggesting that TRAIL-mRNA exists in at least two different splice forms. In accordance with the barely detectable TRAIL-mRNAs levels in untreated Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 A), we were unable to detect TRAIL protein in non-stimulated cells or cell culture supernatants derived thereof. However, three anti-TRAIL-mAb-reactive protein bands were detectable by Western blotting in lysates of PMA/I-stimulated Jurkat cells whereas no TRAIL was detectable in the supernatants. When Jurkat cells were treated with PHA during the last 30 min of PMA/I stimulation a significant amount of all three TRAIL-mAb-reactive proteins were found in the supernatant (Fig. 1 E). TRAIL protein was also detectable in lysates of TNF-treated cells after immunoprecipitation with TRAIL-R2-Fc and protein A-Sepharose (Fig. 1 F). The size of the smallest anti-TRAIL mAb reactive band (19 kDa, Fig. 1, E and F) corresponds to the size of the already described soluble TRAIL product comprising the extracellular receptor-binding domain of the ligand (27Mariani S.M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The sizes of the two slower migrating anti-TRAIL-mAb reactive proteins (32 and 34 kDa) are in good accordance with that of complete TRAIL, suggesting that these two bands represent two isoforms of full-length TRAIL. PHA-stimulation lead to the secretion of all three anti-TRAIL-mAb reactive proteins, suggesting that PHA induces the release of TRAIL containing microvesicles as described elsewhere (28Martinez-Lorenzo M.J. Anel A. Gamen S. Monleón I. Lasierra P. Larrad L. Pineiro A. Alava M.A. Naval J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1274-1281PubMed Google Scholar) rather than inducing proteolytic processing of cell-bound TRAIL. In PMA/I-treated T cells we also observed up-regulation of FasL and TRAIL-R2 mRNA, and in the B-cell lines PMA/I induced TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 (Fig. 1). Analyses of Jurkat cells exclusively stimulated with PMA or ionomycin revealed that PMA alone is sufficient for the induction of TRAIL (data not shown).TNF and PMA/I are both potent inducers of the NF-κB pathway in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 A). We therefore analyzed whether this pathway contributes to TRAIL induction in T cells. For this purpose, we analyzed a mutant Jurkat cell line deficient in expression of IKKγ/NEMO (25Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera-Walsh I. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1448-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), an essential part of the NF-κB-inducing I-κB kinase (IKK) complex (29Karin M. Ben Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4041) Google Scholar). These IKKγ/NEMO-deficient Jurkat cells are unable to respond with NF-κB activation to a variety of NF-κB inducers including TNF and PMA, but show normal activation of NF-AT and AP1 (30Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 B both TNF and PMA/I-induced up-regulation of TRAIL was completely prevented in this mutant Jurkat cell line. However, in a clone derived from the IKKγ/NEMO-deficient Jurkat cell line, in which NF-κB responsiveness had been restored by retransfection with an IKKγ expression construct (30Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), responsiveness of the TRAIL gene toward PMA/I and TNF was partly restored (Fig. 2 A,right panel). Further, PMA/I-induced up-regulation of TRAIL-R2, but not FasL induction, was significantly inhibited in the IKKγ/NEMO-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 2 A). Involvement of the NF-κB pathway in PMA/I-induced TRAIL-R2 expression is in good agreement with some recent studies showing a critical role of the cRel subunit of NF-κB in expression of TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 (24Ravi R. Bedi G.C. Engstrom L.W. Zeng Q. Mookerjee B. Gelinas C. Fuchs E.J. Bedi A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Lack of requirement of the NF-κB pathway for FasL gene induction in IKKγ/NEMO-deficient Jurkat cells has already been described elsewhere (30Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and suggests that the death ligands TRAIL and FasL are up-regulated during T cell activation by at least partially distinct signaling pathways. In the case of TNF-induced TRAIL expression we analyzed the involvement of the NF-κB pathway in a second independent genetic model, i.e. Jurkat T-cells deficient in RIP expression (26Ting A.T. Pimentel-Muinos F.X. Seed B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6189-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The RIP kinase was originally isolated as a Fas interacting death domain-containing kinase, but is also part of the TNF-R1 signaling complex and plays an essential role in TNF-R1-mediated NF-κB activation (31Wajant H. Grell M. Scheurich P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Lack of RIP expression impaired TNF-induced up-regulation of TRAIL (Fig. 2 C) but had no significant effect on PMA/I-induced up-regulation of TRAIL and TRAIL-R2 (data not shown).Figure 2TNF and PMA/I induce TRAIL under critical involvement of the NF-κB pathway. A, Jurkat cells were challenged with TNF (20 ng/ml) or PMA/I (100 nm/1 μg/ml), were harvested after the indicated time, and analyzed for NF-κB activation by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. For further verification of TNF- and PMA/I-induced NF-κB activation, Jurkat cells were transfected with 30 μg of a NF-κB reporter gene construct by electroporation. After splitting and 1 day recovery, the cells were challenged with TNF or PMA/I. As a control some groups were treated with the proteasome inhibitor Mg132 (20 μg/ml), which interferes with NF-κB activation. After an additional 8 h cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase activities.B, the parental Jurkat cell line, RIP- and IKKγ-deficient clones derived thereof, as well as an IKKγ-reconstituted clone of the latter, were treated for 6 h with PMA/I or TNF (20 ng/ml). Total RNAs were isolated for RNase protection analysis and 10 μg of each RNA sample were analyzed with a Multi-Probe template set to detect the indicated mRNAs. L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were included as internal controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, our data clearly argue for an essential involvement of IKKγ/NEMO and therefore most likely the NF-κB pathway in TNF- and PMA/I-induced TRAIL expression. However, the data described so far let open the question whether TRAIL induction occurs directly or not. We therefore analyzed the capability of TNF and PMA/I to induce TRAIL-mRNA in the presence of high concentrations of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). While PMA/I-induced TRAIL expression was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 50 μg/ml CHX (Fig. 3 A) TNF-mediated up-regulation was not affected by this treatment (Fig.3 B). Thus, while PMA/I engages TRAIL transcription indirectly, TNF induces TRAIL expression directly. As interferons are major inducers of TRAIL, we looked for an involvement of endogenous interferons in PMA/I-induced up-regulation of TRAIL. However, we found no evidence for an involvement of interferons in PMA/I-induced up-regulation of TRAIL. So, neutralizing mAbs against IFNα receptor chain 2 or interferon-β failed to inhibit TRAIL-induction (data not shown). Moreover, IFNγ is most likely also not involved in PMA/I-induced up-regulation of TRAIL because even saturating concentrations of recombinant IFNγ only marginally up-regulate TRAIL-mRNA (Fig. 1 E). As both PMA/I and TNF rapidly activate NF-κB under essential involvement of IKKγ/NEMO (Fig. 2,A and B), the differential need for protein synthesis challenges the concept of NF-κB dependent up-regulation of TRAIL (see above). A possible explanation could be the existence of a second pathway that synergistically acts with the NF-κB pathway to induce TRAIL and is directly induced by TNF but only indirectly triggered by PMA/I. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that TRAIL induction occurs by an IKKγ/NEMO-dependent pathway being distinct from the NF-κB pathway, which becomes differentially activated by PMA/I and TNF. With respect to the latter possibility, we found no evidence for a NF-κB dependence of an IFN-responsible reporter gene construct containing about 1 kilobase of the TRAIL promoter (data not shown). Although PMA/I stimulation induced the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL and one of its corresponding death receptors the viability of the PMA/I-treated cells was not affected 1 day after treatment. However, upon prolonged incubation time the PMA/I-treated cells started to die. This transient apoptosis resistance observed in the early phase of PMA/I treatment might be due to the concomitant induction of anti-apoptotic factors. Indeed, we have recently shown that PMA/I induces up-regulation of cFLIP, a potent inhibitor of death receptor signaling (Ref. 32Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Scheurich P. Wajant H.,. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3964-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, Fig. 3 C). Moreover, 6 h of pretreatment with PMA/I protected Jurkat cells from a subsequent 16-h challenge with TRAIL or FasL with an efficiency comparable with the broad range caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Fig.3 D). While TRAIL-induced apoptosis was almost completely blocked by z-VAD-fmk and PMA/I pretreatment, FasL-induced cell death was only partially inhibited by both treatments. This is in good accordance with some recent findings showing that in the absence of CHX, TRAIL induces cell death only via the caspase-dependent Fas-associated death domain protein/caspase-8 pathway, whereas FasL in addition signals necrotic cell death via a caspase-independent RIP-mediated pathway (33Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immu. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 34Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although PMA/I treatment efficiently blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis, PMA/I treatment per se induced cell death in a significant fraction (20–40%) of the cells (Fig. 3 D and Ref. 30Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This per se cytotoxicity of PMA/I might reflect killing of a subpopulation of Jurkat cells in which unbalanced amounts of TRAIL/FasL and FLIP (and maybe additional anti-apoptotic factors) were induced.Figure 3PMA/I - but not TNF-induced up-regulation of TRAIL requires protein synthesis. A, Jurkat cells were stimulated for the indicated times with PMA/I in the presence or absence of 25 μg/ml CHX and were analyzed by RNase protection assay analysis. B, Jurkat cells were stimulated for 6 h with TNF in the presence or absence of 25 μg/ml CHX and were analyzed by RNase protection assay analysis. C, Total RNA of PMA/I-treated (6 h) and untreated Jurkat cells were analyzed using a customer template set containing TRAIL and cFLIP-specific probes among others. D, Jurkat cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 50 × 103 cells/well and treated overnight in triplicates with the indicated concentration of cross-linked FasL or cross-linked TRAIL with (open circles) or without (closed circles) z-VAD-fmk (10 μm). In addition, cells were challenged with TRAIL or FasL after 6 h of PMA/I treatment (open squares). Finally, viable cells were quantified by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)/Apo2L belongs to the TNF ligand family and induces apoptosis in a broad range of tumor cells with apparently no cytotoxic activity on most nontransformed cells. TRAIL mRNA was found in a variety of tissues, in particular in activated T cells, and is often induced by interferons (1Wang Q. Ji Y. Wang X. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TRAIL interacts with five different members of the TNF receptor superfamily: TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5/TRICK2/Killer, TRAIL-R3/TRID/DcR1/LIT, TRAIL-R4/TRUNDD/DcR2 and osteoprotegerin (2Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2962) Google Scholar). TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 contain a death domain and mediate the apoptotic response toward TRAIL. TRAIL-R3, lacking a cytoplasmic domain, is anchored to the cell surface by modification with glycophospholipids and is regarded as a decoy receptor for TRAIL. TRAIL-R4 has an incomplete cytoplasmic death domain and is therefore incapable of signaling apoptosis but is still able to activate the antiapoptotic NF-κB pathway. Thus, TRAIL-R4 is maybe involved in regulation of the apoptotic TRAIL response at the cellular level. The soluble receptor osteoprotegerin, which otherwise has a critical role in regulation of osteoclastogenesis, may act as a systemic negative regulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis (1Wang Q. Ji Y. Wang X. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TRAIL is involved in the induction of cell death by activated CD4+ T cells (3Thomas W.D. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2195-2200PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Nakayama M.

Med. 1998; 188: 2375-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). TRAIL may also play a role in activation-induced T cell death during HIV infection (7Katsikis P.D. Garcia-Ojeda M.E.

Med. 2001; 193: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Inhibition of endogenous TRAIL enhances proliferation of autoreactive lymphocytes or synovial cells, thereby contributing to the exacerbation of arthritic inflammation and joint tissue destruction (10Song K. Chen Y. Goke R. Wilmen A. Seidel C. Goke A. Hilliard B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These data argue for an in vivofunction of TRAIL in the maintenance of immune homeostasis by counteracting autoimmune responses. However, in contrast to FasL, TRAIL inhibits autoimmune inflammation by inhibition of cell cycle progression instead of induction of T cell apoptosis (10Song K. Chen Y. Goke R. Wilmen A. Seidel C. Goke A. Hilliard B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In accordance with its remarkable tumoricidal activity in vitro, several studies point to a role of TRAIL in anti-tumoral immunity. In this regard, it has been recently shown that TRAIL is the sole principle mediating antitumorigenic activity of interferon-activated human monocytes (11Griffith T.S. Wiley S.R. Kubin M.Z. Sedger L.M. Maliszewski C.R. Fanger N.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1343-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Moreover, up-regulation of TRAIL plays a central role in IFNγ-mediated antimetastatic effects of interleukin-12 and α-galactosylceramide (12Takeda K. Hayakawa Y. Smyth M.J. Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N.

Further, aside from the capability of dendritic cells to acquire antigen from apoptotic cells to cross-present these antigens to cytotoxic T cells (14Albert M.L. Sauter B. Bhardwaj N. Nature. 1998; 392: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar, 15Albert M.L. Pearce S.F. Francisco L.M. Sauter B. Roy P. Silverstein R.L. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), dendritic cells directly mediate cellular apoptosis via TRAIL after stimulation with IFNα or IFNγ (5Fanger N.A. Maliszewski C.R. Schooley K. Griffith T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Of interest, a recent study indicates that type I IFNs induce the rapid maturation of monocytes into short-lived TRAIL-expressing dendritic cells (16Santini S.M. Lapenta C. Logozzi M. Parlato S. Spada M. Di Pucchio T. Belardelli F. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Moreover, type I IFNs up-regulate TRAIL expression on anti-CD3-stimulated human peripheral blood T cells suggesting that TRAIL contributes to the indirect cytotoxic activity of type I IFNs used in cancer therapy for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemias and renal cell carcinomas (17Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Nakayama M. Eto H. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In accordance with an antitumoral function of TRAIL, the death domain-containing TRAIL receptors 1 (18Bartke T. Siegmund D. Peters N. Reichwein M. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Wajant H.

In this study we show that TRAIL is induced by TNF and treatment with phorbol ester under critical involvement of NEMO/IKKγ, an essential component of the NF-κB signaling pathway, may account for some of the apoptotic effects described for NF-κB in the literature (20Beg A.A.

Central to the regulation of embryonic development is the determination of time- and position-restricted signaling instructions during morphogenesis of different phenotypes, with tooth formation being a classic example. It is now evident that a hierarchy of growth factors and their downstream transcription factors compose a conserved “morphogenetic code,” a set of rules common to processes that are used repeatedly in different combinations to make functional organs (1Lumsden A. Krumlauf R. Science. 1996; 274: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 2Hogan B.L.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 ligands are expressed in a time- and tissue-specific manner and are important in regulating the formation of tooth and Meckel's cartilage (3Chai Y. Mah A. Crohin C. Groff S. Bringas Jr., P. Le T. Santos V. Slavkin H.C. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Smad proteins relay TGF-β signaling from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Extracellular TGF-β signals are transduced via membrane-bound TGF-β type II and type I receptors, which phosphorylate intracellular Smad2 and Smad3. Activated Smad molecules appear to regulate the expression of transcription factors and affect the transcriptional status of target genes (4Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

Smad1, -2, -3, and -5 interact with and are phosphorylated by specific type I serine/threonine kinase receptors, and thereby act in a pathway-restricted manner. In particular, Smad2 and Smad3 are phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus after stimulation by TGF-β (5Eppert K. Scherer S.W. Ozcelik H. Pirone R. Hoodless P. Kim H. Tsui L. Andrulis I.L.

It is possible that there may be some redundancy in the functional activity of these two family members. The action of Smad4 differs from other members of the Smad family.

In particular, Smad7 associates stably with the TGF-β receptor complex, but is not phosphorylated upon TGF-β stimulation. Smad7 inhibits TGF-β-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Because transcription of the inhibitory Smad gene is induced by stimulation of TGF-β (8Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.

Previous studies have shown that TGF-β subtypes have specific functions during critical epithelial-mesenchymal interactions related to the formation of tooth and Meckel's cartilage (21Hall B.K. Davidovitch Z. The Biological Mechanisms of Tooth Movement and Craniofacial Adaptation. 2nd Ed. Ohio State University, Columbus, OH1992Google Scholar, 3Chai Y. Mah A. Crohin C. Groff S. Bringas Jr., P. Le T. Santos V. Slavkin H.C. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In particular, TGF-β2 exerts a negative regulation on the proliferation of enamel organ epithelial cells through a possible autocrine mechanism during early stages of tooth development (22Chai Y. Zhao J. Mogharei A. Xu B. Bringas Jr., P. Shuler C. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1999; 86: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, regulation of intracellular TGF-β signaling during early craniofacial morphogenesis has not been defined. Recent study has shown that the expression of Smad1 and Smad2 are closely associated with critical stages of odontogenesis (23Dick A. Risau W. Drexler H. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More importantly, targeted disruptions of Smad genes have revealed important biological functions of these intracellular signaling molecules. But because of the early embryonic lethality associated with the Smad null mutation, such as Smad2−/−, it has not been possible to investigate the biological function of TGF-β signaling Smad during organogenesis. Here, we investigated the functional roles of Smad2 and Smad7 during embryonic tooth development using mandibular explants as the experimental model. Our experiments provide the first biological evidence that Smad2 versus Smad7 have important and opposite regulatory roles during early tooth formation. Furthermore, different Smad molecules may contribute to the diverse biological functions of TGF-β signaling in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. The outcome of TGF-β signaling is sensitive to the level of Smad expression. Timed-pregnant Swiss-Webster or C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed on postcoital day 11 (E11). E11 embryos (42–44 somite pairs) were staged according to the external developmental characteristics as described by Theiler (24Theiler K. The House Mouse, Atlas of Embryonic Development. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). The first branchial arch explants (eight per dish) were cultured for periods up to 9 days according to the standard methods (3Chai Y. Mah A. Crohin C. Groff S. Bringas Jr., P. Le T. Santos V. Slavkin H.C. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Primers were designed based on the murine Smad2, Smad3, and Smad7 cDNA sequences. Primers for Smad2 were 5′-TCACAGTCATCATGAGCTCAAGG-3′ and 5′-TGTGACGCATGGAAGGTCTCTC-3′. The PCR product size was 471 bp. Primers for Smad3 were 5′-GAGTAGAGACGCCAGTTCTACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTTGGAGAACCTGCGTCCAT-3′. The PCR product size was 234 bp. Primers for Smad7 were 5′-AATGGCTTTTGCCTCGGACAGC-3′ and 5′-CACAAAGCTGATCTGCACGGTG-3′. The product size was 321 bp. Construction of Smad2, -3, and -7 competitors was done as previously described by Zhao et al. (25Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,26Zhao J. Sime P.J. Bringas Jr., P. Gauldie J. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A 256-bp fragment of murine Smad2 cDNA subcloned into pBluescript II SK was digested with NotI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for an antisense probe. For a Smad2 sense probe, pBluescript II SK was cut with EcoRI and transcribed with T3 polymerase. A 602-bp fragment of murine Smad7 cDNA subcloned into pCR2.1 was digested with HindIII and transcribed with T7 polymerase for an antisense probe. The RNA probes were labeled with digoxigenin labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Serial sectioned tissue preparation and subsequent hybridization were performed according to the method of Zhao et al. (25Zhao J. Bu D. Lee M. Slavkin H.C. Hall F. Warburton D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sectioned immunohistochemistry was accomplished by following standard procedure (22Chai Y. Zhao J. Mogharei A. Xu B. Bringas Jr., P. Shuler C. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1999; 86: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In particular, adjacent sections through the same tooth organ were mounted onto the same slide so that some of these sections could be stained with either anti-Smad2 or anti-Smad3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology., CA), or PS2 antibody (Dr. C.-H. Heldin) and the others stained with anti-Smad7 (Dr. S. Souchelnytskyi) to examine the co-localization of different Smads. Positive staining was indicated by orange-red coloration. The slides were counter-stained with hematoxylin. Smad2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) 5′-GCACGATGGACGACAT-3′ and Smad7 ODN 5′- GTTTGGTCCTGAACAT-3′ were synthesized by Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Because of the high homology between Smad2 and Smad3, only one mismatch at the underlined nucleotide “C” was found for murine Smad3 cDNA (9Chen Y. Lebrun J. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12992-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). The antisense ODN was designed to surround the translation initiation site. Two same-length control ODNs (sense and scrambled) were also synthesized for either Smad2 or Smad7. The first three and the last three bases in each ODN sequence were modified by phosphorothioation to improve stability against nuclease degradation in culture. Antisense, sense, or scrambled ODNs were added to E11 mandibular explant cultures in aqueous solution to achieve a final concentration of 30 μm, a concentration known to be effective in our organ culture system (3Chai Y. Mah A. Crohin C. Groff S. Bringas Jr., P. Le T. Santos V. Slavkin H.C. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Chai Y. Zhao J. Mogharei A. Xu B. Bringas Jr., P. Shuler C. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1999; 86: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ODN in fresh medium was replaced every other day. Each experimental group had 72 mandibular explants. In order to evaluate the morphological effect induced by Smad antisense treatment on tooth formation, the size of tooth organ was measured. Six mandibular explants from each treatment group (control, Smad2 or Smad7 antisense, sense, or scrambled) were serially sectioned at 5-μm intervals and were processed for H and E staining. Each section of a tooth organ was traced throughout the serial sections of the mandibular explant. The volume of each tooth organ was determined by adding all the tooth bud area on each serial section and then multiplying by 5 μm to obtain the total volume of a tooth organ in μm3. Using the Epistat Statistical Package, one-way, one-level analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to test for significant changes in the size of tooth bud among control, Smad2 or Smad7 antisense ODN, sense ODN, and scrambled ODN treated groups. A difference was considered statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05 (p < 0.05). To further analyze tooth organ size, three-dimensional reconstructions were completed as previously described (27Chai Y. Klauser D. Denny P.A. Denny P.C. Anat. Rec. 1993; 235: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The total protein concentration in each mandibular sample was determined by comparing to bovine serum albumin standards. Seventy-five μg of total protein from each sample was loaded in each well on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Western analysis was done as previously described (22Chai Y. Zhao J. Mogharei A. Xu B. Bringas Jr., P. Shuler C. Warburton D. Mech. Dev. 1999; 86: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis activity was monitored in E11+7 mandibular explants using BrdUrd (5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine, Sigma) at 100 μm in serumless chemically defined medium for 2 h at 37 °C. Mandibular explants were placed in tissue culture dish with either control medium or medium plus Smad sense or antisense ODN. After 2 h culture with BrdUrd, the mandibular explants were harvested and fixed for immunostaining (28Chai Y. Bringas P. Mogharei A. Shuler C.F. Slavkin H.C. Dev. Dynamics. 1998; 213: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). BrdUrd-labeled cells and the total number of cells within the enamel organ epithelium, or within the adjacent dental mesenchyme of a tooth bud were counted from seven randomly selected sections per mandibular explant. Three mandibular explants were evaluated from each experimental group. Apoptotic cells were localized by detecting DNA fragmentation. TUNEL analysis was performed on paraffin sections using the In Situ Cell Death Detection (Fluorescein) kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by following the manufacturer's protocol. Affi-Gel blue beads (Bio-Rad), diameter 50–80 μm, were used. The beads were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 10 μg/ml TGF-β2 or activin βA (R&D). Control beads were incubated in 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Genotypes of Smad2 and Smad3 mutant mouse embryos were determined by PCR as previously described (29Weinstein M. Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Gotay J. Deng C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9378-9383Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 30Yang X. Letterio J. Lechleider R. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the function of each Smad during early tooth morphogenesis, we first examined the spatial and temporal distribution of Smad2, -3, and Smad7 by both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In vitroanalysis using E11 mandibular explants cultured in serumless, chemically defined medium indicated that Smad2, -3, and Smad7 were closely associated with tooth morphogenesis from dental lamina stage to late bud stage. In particular, at E11+2, Smad2 was localized within enamel organ epithelium (Fig.1 A), while Smad7 was not detectable (Fig. 1 B). At E11+4, Smad3 was localized mainly to the enamel organ epithelium with little staining in the adjacent mesenchyme (Fig. 1 C). Smad7 was expressed within enamel organ epithelium (Fig. 1 D). By the time the mandibular organ culture was terminated (E11+9), tooth development reached bud stage. Both Smad2 and Smad7 were localized within enamel organ epithelium and adjacent mesenchyme (Fig. 1, E and F). More importantly, phosphorylated Smad2 was localized within the nuclei of enamel organ epithelial cells, indicating that activated Smad2 had translocated into the nucleus (Fig. 1 E, inset). In tandem, the expression of Smad2 and Smad7 mRNA was also examined. As shown in Fig. 1, G and H, the mRNA of Smad2 and Smad7 was localized to the late bud stage enamel organ epithelial cells at E11+9, a pattern identical to the immunolocalization of these two Smads (Fig. 1, E and F). Furthermore, examination of Smad2, -3, and -7 expression patterns in vivo revealed identical information during these early comparable stages of tooth development (data not shown). In addition, we also examined the expression pattern of Smad2 and Smad7 during cap and bell stages of tooth development in vivo (data not shown). Both of these Smads were mainly expressed in inner enamel epithelium and its adjacent dental mesenchyme, indicating that TGF-β signaling plays a critical role in regulating continued epithelial-mesenchymal interaction throughout tooth development. To investigate the functional role of endogenous Smad2 and -7 during early tooth development, we utilized the antisense inhibition strategy during mandibular morphogenesis in vitro. Both competitive PCR and Western analysis were used to measure the amount of Smad expression in mandibular explants after antisense ODN treatment. All PCR products were sequenced or digested with restriction enzymes for final verification. E11 embryonic mandibular explants treated with Smad2 antisense ODN significantly decreased the amount of endogenous Smad2 and moderately reduced the level of Smad3 mRNA (Fig.2 a), while Smad2 sense and scrambled control ODN-treated explants yielded amounts of Samd2 and Smad3 mRNA comparable to the media control (Fig. 2 a). Addition of exogenous TGF-β2 (2 ng/ml) did not reverse the reduction of Smad2 or Smad3 mRNA caused by Smad2 antisense ODN treatment. When exogenous TGF-β2 was added along with sense or scrambled control ODNs the mRNA level of both Smad2 and Smad3 was not affected. As illustrated by competitive PCR, mandibular explants cultured with scrambled control ODNs to Smad7 yielded a comparable amount of Smad7 mRNA to the media control, whereas mandibles treated with antisense ODN to Smad7 resulted in a reduced level of endogenous Smad7 mRNA (Fig. 2 b). Exogenous TGF-β1 or -β2 (2 ng/ml) stimulated endogenous Smad7 expression in cultured mandibular explants in the presence of either media or scrambled Smad7 ODN control, confirming the responsiveness of Smad7 gene expression to TGF-β stimuli (Fig.2 b). However, when mandibular explants were treated with both Smad7 antisense ODN and exogenous TGF-β the basal level of Smad7 mRNA was significantly reduced, indicating the effectiveness of Smad7 antisense oligos. Furthermore, to ensure that Smad7 antisense ODN specifically inhibited endogenous Smad7 mRNA expression but not other Smad gene expression, endogenous Smad3 mRNA was examined in the cultured mandibular explants treated with Smad7 ODN and was not affected (Fig. 2 b), indicating the specificity of Smad7 antisense ODN in mandibular organ culture. To evaluate the effect of antisense oligos on Smad protein expression, total protein was extracted from cultured mandibular explants. Smad2 antisense ODN resulted in a significant reduction of Smad2 and moderate reduction of Smad3, while mandibular explants treated with sense ODN showed Smad2 and Smad3 expression level comparable to the media control (Fig. 2 c). Furthermore, Smad2 antisense ODN also significantly reduced the level of phosphorylated Smad2 (PS2), indicating a successful interference of TGF-β signaling (Fig.2 c). The same membrane was striped and incubated with β-actin antibody and showed equal loading of total protein extract. In another experiment where mandibular explants were treated with Smad7 antisense ODN the expression of Smad7 was significantly reduced, whereas Smad7 sense ODN-treated samples yielded a comparable expression of Smad7 to the control (Fig. 2 c). Collectively, Smad2 and Smad7 antisense ODNs at 30 μm effectively attenuated their gene expression. Attenuation of Smad2 induced a 3-fold increase (p < 0.05) in tooth size as well as an advanced stage of tooth development (Fig. 3 B) compared with treated (Fig. 3 A) and sense controls. The addition of exogenous TGF-β1 or -β2 to the antisense-treated explants did not restore the tooth size and stage back to a state comparable to the nontreated and sense controls (see Fig. 7). Our previous experiments, however, demonstrated the effectiveness of addition of exogenous TGF-β2 to rescue the phenotype caused by TGF-β2 antisense treatment (3Chai Y. Mah A. Crohin C. Groff S. Bringas Jr., P. Le T. Santos V. Slavkin H.C. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The extent of advancement of tooth formation with the addition of Smad2 antisense ODN was further demonstrated with three-dimensional reconstruction of serially sectioned mandibular explants. As shown in Fig.4 C, the advancement of tooth formation with Smad2 antisense ODN treatment was not limited to a few sections, but rather it was the entire tooth organ (with an average size of 5.9 × 105 μm3) in comparison to the control (Fig. 4 A, with an average tooth organ of 1.7 × 105 μm3) or sense ODN treated (Fig. 4 B). Collectively, these results support the conclusion that attenuation of Smad2 expression releases the negative regulation on tooth growth by endogenous TGF-β signaling system.Figure 7Smad2 and Smad7 antisense ODN treatment differentially interfered with TGF-β-mediated enamel organ epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. A, at E11+7, cultured mandibular explant showed proper enamel organ epithelial cell proliferation in the control tooth organ (tb). B, Smad2 antisense ODN plus exogenous TGF-β2 (2 ng/ml) treated mandibular explant showed advanced tooth development into cap stage with significantly increased proliferative activity within the enamel organ epithelium (*).C, Smad7 antisense ODN plus exogenous TGF-β2 (2 ng/ml) treatment retarded tooth development without affecting the proliferation of enamel organ epithelial cells (*). D, at E11+7, bud stage tooth organ (tb) did not show any apoptotic activity in the control sample. E, Smad2 antisense ODN plus exogenous TGF-β2 (2 ng/ml)-treated mandibular explant showed advanced tooth development into cap stage without any detectable apoptotic activity within the enamel organ epithelium.

Three-dimensional reconstruction of serially sectioned mandibular explants treated with Smad7 antisense ODN demonstrated a more than 2-fold reduction in the size of tooth organs (with an average size of 0.5 × 105 μm3) within the mandible (Fig. 4 D). In tandem, our previous dose-response experiments demonstrated that addition of exogenous TGF-β2 into mandibular explants reduced the size of tooth organ approximately 3-fold (3Chai Y. Mah A. Crohin C. Groff S. Bringas Jr., P. Le T. Santos V. Slavkin H.C. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Collectively, attenuation of Smad7 gene expression resulted in elevated TGF-β signaling and a concomitant potentiation of TGF-β-mediated inhibition of early embryonic tooth development. The biological importance of TGF-β signaling Smads during early tooth development was evaluated for its impact on enamel organ epithelial cell proliferation. TGF-β-induced growth arrest occurs late in the G1 phase and is accompanied by a reduction in the cell proliferation activity in mammalian cells.

Amino acid sequence analysis of the smallest (8.5 kDa), quinone-cofactor-bearing subunit of this heterotrimeric enzyme encountered difficulties in the interpretation of the results at several sites of the polypeptide chain. As this suggested posttranslational modifications of the subunit, the structural genes for this enzyme were determined and mass spectrometric de novo sequencing was applied to several peptides obtained by chemical or enzymatic cleavage. In agreement with the interpretation of the X-ray electronic densities in the diffraction data for the holoenzyme, our results show that the polypeptide of the small subunit contains four intrachain cross-linkages in which the sulfur atom of a cysteine residue is involved. Two of these cross-linkages occur with the beta-carbon atom of an aspartic acid, one with the gamma-carbon atom of a glutamic acid and the fourth with a tryptophanquinone residue, this adduct constituting the enzyme's quinone cofactor, CTQ. The thioether type bond in all four of these adducts has never been found in other proteins. CTQ is a novel cofactor in the series of the recently discovered quinone cofactors."

Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar). This process involves interaction between conserved subsequences within the oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-α subunits and the β-domain of pVHL, with pVHL acting as the recognition element of a multicomponent E3 ubiquitin ligase (12Cockman M.E.

These studies demonstrate the critical importance of pVHL in regulation of the HIF transcriptional cascade in this cell background. Nevertheless, studies of co-activator recruitment (10Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.-K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and nuclear localization (9Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in other cell types have provided evidence for other regulatory steps in HIF activation that are not known to be dependent on pVHL function. In addition, inactivation of other tumor suppressors such as p53 and PTEN, and activation of a variety of oncogenic and growth signaling pathways can induce the HIF system in non-hypoxic cells or amplify the response to hypoxia (22Zelzer E.

The mechanisms by which these stimuli interact with HIF-α molecules are less clear than for pVHL, though p53 inactivation has been proposed to affect targeting of HIF-1α to an mdm-2-dependent ubiquitin ligase (23Ravi R. Mookerjee B. Bhujwalla Z.M. Sutter C.H. Artemov D. Zeng Q. Dillehay L.E. Madan A. Semenza G.L. Bedi A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 34-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To provide further insights into the upstream pathways that regulate the HIF system, we have devised a genetic screen for mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with altered HRE activity. Previously, we described the selection of cells with reduced hypoxic HRE activity from a mutagenized culture of CHO cells, and the analysis of one clone that was functionally defective in HIF-1α (28Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate the use of a similar strategy based on linking HREs to genes encoding cell surface antigens for selection of cells manifesting constitutive overactivity of the HRE in normoxia. We describe the selection and partial characterization of a series of mutant cell lines with significantly increased normoxic levels of HIF-1α. Some but not all of these lines have been shown to possess inactivating mutations in the VHL gene. CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the Imperial Cancer Res. Fund laboratories, UK. Parental cells and all derivatives were grown in Ham's F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Globepharm), l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 IU/ml), streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml), and additional selection agents as indicated. The stable transfectant, C4.5, has been described previously (28Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, it contains two separately integrated HRE-linked reporter genes encoding CD2 and E-Selectin expressed from plasmids pHPGK-CD2 and p(E1–25)5SV-ESel, respectively. The stable transfectant E48.4.51, containing two separately integrated HRE-linked reporter genes (E-Selectin and firefly luciferase expressed from plasmids pPurPGK6TKpESel and pGL3PGK6TKp, respectively) was produced during the current study (see below). To maintain the stability of these HRE-linked reporters, C4.5, E48.4.51, and derivative cells were maintained in the selection media that had been used to select the original integrants (C4.5 and derivatives, G418 (0.5 mg/ml) and hygromycin (0.75 mg/ml); E48.4.51 and derivatives, puromycin (5 μg/ml) and hygromycin (0.75 mg/ml)). pPurPGK6TKpESel and pGL3PGK6TKpLUC both contained an optimized HRE enhancer/promoter (PGK6TKp) that consists of six copies of a 24-nucleotide sequence of the mouse PGK-1 HRE 5′-CGCGTCGTGCAGGACGTGACAAAT-3′-linked to a “minimal” promoter consisting of nucleotides 107–194 from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (GenBank™ accession numberM80483). Plasmid design is illustrated schematically in Fig.1. Mutagenesis was performed by exposure of ∼108 cells to ICR 191 (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml for 5 h using a protocol modified from previous studies (28Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W.

Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 506-509PubMed Google Scholar). This exposure resulted in ∼50% cell lethality. Multiple exposures to ICR 191 (three for the selection experiment from C4.5 cells and two for the selection experiment from E48.4.51 cells) were performed by re-growing cells to the original number before repeating the procedure. Immunoselection by “panning” was adapted from a previously described protocol, to permit selection of cells that overexpressed HRE-linked markers in normoxia. Cells were labeled with mouse IgG1 anti-human E-Selectin (Serotec) diluted 1/1000. Panning was performed as described previously (28Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) using plates coated with goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). After each round adherent cells were retrieved, re-grown to similar numbers, and subjected to the next round of selection. At intervals, aliquots of cells were assayed for changes in HRE-linked reporter expression by FACS. Magnetic immunoselection was performed using the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec). Antibody labeling was performed for 15 min at 4 °C with FITC-conjugated anti-human E-Selectin (R&D Systems) at 1:10 dilution. Cells were then washed, and resuspended in MACS anti-FITC microbeads and incubated for 15 min at 6 °C. The cells were then washed, resuspended, and applied onto a prechilled 4 °C VS+ column with a 20G flow resistor. The effluent was discarded, the column was removed from the magnetic separator, and the retained fraction was eluted. This sequence was repeated immediately, and the final eluate collected as the positive fraction. Following selection, an aliquot of cells was analyzed by FACS analysis for E-Selectin and luciferase assay, while the remaining cells were grown to reach a population of ∼1 × 107 cells before undergoing further magnetic selection on a (smaller) MS+ column using similar methods. Assays of defects in regulation of the HIF signal pathway activity were performed by transient transfection using electroporation, or Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Plasmids expressing full-length human HIF-1α (pcDNA3-HIF-1α), Gal4 amino acids 1–147, (pGal), or Gal4 1–147 fused to HIF-1α amino acids 28–826 (pGal/α28–826), and the Gal4UAS-linked reporter plasmid (pUAS-tk-luc) have been described previously (6Pugh C.W.

Pugh C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2060-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). pGL3PGK6TKp (Fig. 1) was used as an HRE-linked reporter plasmid. Co-transfection of plasmid pCMV-βGal was used to enable correction for transfection efficiency. Comparison of normoxic and hypoxic gene expression was performed on parallel cultures maintained in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 balance air, or 0.1% O2, 5% CO2 balance nitrogen in a NAPCO 7001 incubator (Precision Scientific). Exposures were for 16 h (mRNA analysis, reporter gene analysis) or 4 h for HIF-1α protein analysis. Assays of luciferase reporter gene activity were normalized to that of a co-transfected control plasmid (pCMV-βGal) in transient transfections and to total extracted protein (Bio-Rad) in stably transfected cells. Luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates using a commercial assay system (Promega) and a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs). β-Galactosidase activity in cell lysates was measured using O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Expression of cell surface markers was analyzed by FACS after labeling cells with mouse IgG1 FITC-conjugated anti-human E-Selectin (R&D Systems) or mouse IgG2b phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-human CD2 (Serotec). RNA was extracted by a modified acid/guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (RNAzol B, Cinna/Biotec Laboratories), dissolved in hybridization buffer (80% formamide, 40 mm PIPES, 400 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), and analyzed by RNase protection as described previously (31Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2423-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the protected species was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and was related to an internal control assay for a constitutively expressed U6 small nuclear RNA. The riboprobe template for Chinese hamster Glut-1 was described previously (32Vaux E.C. Metzen E. Yeates K.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The riboprobe template for Chinese hamster HIF-1α was generated by the polymerase chain reaction from an a23 Chinese hamster lung fibroblastoid cell cDNA library using oligonucleotides based on the mouse sequence (nucleotides 682–946; GenBank™ accession number U59496). The quantity of RNA analyzed was as follows: U6 small nuclear RNA, 5 ng; Glut-1, 20 μg; and HIF-1α, 50 μg. Glucose transport was determined by measuring the uptake of 2-deoxy-d-glucose using modifications of a previously described method (33Hasegawa K. Anraku Y. Kasahara M. Akamatsu Y. Nishijima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1051: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Assays were performed on cells grown to near confluence in 60-mm dishes. The medium was aspirated, and cells washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C. Cells were incubated for 2 min at 37 °C in 900 μl of Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 2 mm pyruvate and 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose 0.5 mm (1 μCi/ml), after which uptake was stopped by washing (three times) in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were lysed by the addition of 2% SDS. Uptake was calculated as nanomoles/106cells/min following liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific uptake was determined from parallel assays performed in the presence of 0.5 mm HgCl2, and subtracted. Cell numbers were determined by setting up parallel 60-mm dishes for Coulter counting (Coulter Electronics). Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (34Wiesener M.S. Turley H. Allen W.E. William C. Eckardt K.-U. Talks K.L. Wood S.M. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. HIF-1α was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody, clone H1α67 (Novus Biologicals); the hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA) was detected using monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell fusions were performed using polyethylene glycol as described previously (28Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To enable selection of heterokaryons following fusion, additional selectable properties were generated as follows. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase-deficient (HPRT−) derivatives of each line were obtained by selection in 6-thioguanine (30 μm). Resistance genes encoding neomycin phosphotransferase (pSV2Neo) or puromycin acetyl transferase (pPur, CLONTECH) were stably expressed into E48.4.51 derivatives or C4.5 derivatives, respectively. This enabled fusions between parental and mutant cells or between different mutant cells to be selected in HAT medium (hypoxanthine (15 μg/ml), methotrexate (1 μm), and thymidine (10 μg/ml)) containing either G418 or puromycin. Following fusions, pools of selected cells were assessed by FACS analysis of E-Selectin or CD2 expression and immunoblotting for HIF-1α. Stable transfectants expressing either a wild type HA epitope-tagged human VHLgene or an inactive mutant (N90I) were obtained by transfection of each cell line with pcDNA3-VHL.HA or pcDNA3-(N90I) VHL.HA (12Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R. Jaakkola P. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Maher E.R. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25733-25741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), which contain a neomycin resistance expression cassette. For selection of stable transfectants, C4.5 derivatives were additionally co-transfected with pPur (CLONTECH) and C4.5 or E48.4.51 supertransfectants were selected in puromycin and G418, respectively. Genomic DNA was prepared from CHO mutant cells by proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction. Exons were PCR amplified individually using the following primers; exon 1, 5′-AAGGCAGCTGGTCAAGAGGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCCGAAAGCACAGGTAGATACTTTG-3′; exon 2, 5′-CCCGGCTCATGCTTCTCTTTTAGG-3′ and 5′-GGTAACTCAGGGCTGTAATCCCAG-3′; exon 3, 5′-CTGAAATGACACTATCACGTC-3′ and 5′-GGCGCGCCGAAAGAAAGTGACCTGTCC-3′. PCR products were sequenced using BigDye terminators (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI 373 sequencer. Confirmation of heterozygosity of mutations was obtained by ligation of PCR products into pGEMTeasy, and sequencing the insert in cloned plasmids. Response to 5-azacytidine was tested by exposure of cells to 4 μm for 24 h and assay of the phenotype by FACS analysis for E-Selectin expression. In vitro assays of HIF-lα ubiquitylation in cell extracts were performed using modifications of a previously described method (12Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R. Jaakkola P. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Maher E.R. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25733-25741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). In brief, cell extracts were prepared from wild type and mutant CHO cells in a hypotonic extraction buffer at 4 °C, centrifuged at 10,000 ×g, and stored in aliquots at −70 °C prior to analysis. Ubiquitylation reactions were performed at 30 °C using cell extracts supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system and ubiquitin (Sigma). [35S]Methionine-labeled human HIF-1α substrate was produced in coupled transcription and translation (IVTT) reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT, Promega) supplemented with ferrous chloride, 100 μm, and programmed with pcDNA3-HIF-1α. For complementation experiments, human pVHL was produced by IVTT in reticulocyte lysates and preincubated with the ubiquitylation reaction mix for 5 min prior to addition of the HIF-1α substrate. Our purpose in these experiments was to select cells with elevated HRE activity that might have trans-acting defects in regulation of the HIF system. Because we have not yet been able to develop a selection strategy based on the expression and/or activity of an endogenous HIF-1 target gene, we first created transfected CHO cell lines expressing HRE-linked cell surface markers that permitted immunoselection. One such cell line (C4.5), which bears separately integrated HRE-linked genes, encoding the surface antigens E-Selectin and CD2, has been described previously (28Wood S.M. Wiesener M.S. Yeates K.M. Okada N. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8360-8368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In an attempt to improve the selectable characteristics we created a second transfected CHO line (E48.4.51) during the course of this work. First, we constructed several configurations of HRE-linked promoters and tested then in transient transfection assays. From these assays the regulatory cassette PGK6TKp, in which 6 HREs were linked to a minimal TK promoter (Fig. 1), was chosen on the basis of very low activity in normoxia and a high level of induction by hypoxia. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pPurPGK6TKpE-Sel, and transfectants were selected in puromycin. Clones were tested for hypoxia-inducible E-Selectin expression, and a clone showing high level induction was further transfected with pGL3PGK6TKpLuc and pSVHyg. Supertransfectants were then selected in hygromycin B. One clone (E48.4.51) was chosen for mutagenesis and selection that showed low baseline and highly inducible expression of both markers (Fig. 1). Following mutagenesis different selection procedures were used for the C4.5 and E48.4.51 cells. C4.5 cells were subject to positive immunoselection using E-Selectin and panning. Cells were maintained in 10 separate pools throughout the selection procedure, and aliquots of each pool were assayed at intervals for high expression of the second (integrated but unselected) HRE-linked marker, CD2. After 15 rounds of panning, aliquots of the five pools that showed the greatest increase in normoxic expression of CD2 were cloned by limiting dilution. Clones were re-assayed with respect to expression of cell surface markers, and those showing constitutive up-regulation of both stably integrated markers were tested further for enhanced normoxic HRE activity by transient transfection of an HRE-linked luciferase reporter. Of 39 clones tested in this way, two clones, M2.18 and M6.19 (derived from separate pools), were selected for further analysis on the basis of manifesting large increases in normoxic activity of both the stably integrated and transiently transfected HREs. Results of FACS analyses of both normoxic and hypoxic cells are shown in Fig.2 A. In comparison with C4.5, both lines show a clear up-regulation of both markers in normoxia. E48.4.51 cells were subject to positive selection for increased expression of E-Selectin by magnetic cell sorting. After each round of selection, an aliquot of cells was removed from culture and tested for expression of the HRE-linked luciferase marker. Increased normoxic expression of luciferase was observed after the third round of magnetic selection suggesting that the selection procedure was somewhat more efficient than the panning protocol. After five rounds the increase was much more marked. Aliquots of cells were cloned by limiting dilution after the 5th, 6th, and 7th magnetic selection rounds. Individual clones were then tested for normoxic up-regulation of the stably integrated HRE-linked luciferase and E-Selectin genes. The stably integrated luciferase gene prevented the further assay of HRE activity by transient transfection of an HRE-linked luciferase reporter, as was used on the C4.5 derivatives. We therefore sought a different screening method that could be used for rapid assessment of clones likely to possess the desired property of a trans-acting abnormality in HIF/HRE activation. During the course of this second selection experiment we determined that the clones selected from C4.5 in the first experiment (M2.18 and M6.19) showed significantly enhanced rates of uptake of labeled glucose analogues. We therefore screened the E48.4.51 derivatives using an assay of 2-deoxy-d-glucose transport. From ∼200 clones tested, we selected for further analysis three (10.8, 10.10, 14.2) that showed the greatest and most stable normoxic up-regulation of both the HRE-linked reporters and normoxic up-regulation of glucose transport. Results of FACS analysis of E-Selectin expression in normoxia and hypoxia are shown in Fig. 2 B. In comparison with the parental cell line, E48.4.51, the up-regulation of E-Selectin expression in normoxic cells is clearly apparent. In hypoxia, different responses were observed. Although some lines showed a further increase in E-S"

The drugs currently in use to treat trypanosomiasis are old, ineffective, and toxic. There is a need for new therapeutic approaches, and it is anticipated that candidate drug targets will be uncovered by sequencing Trypanosoma genomes. The most promising targets are gene products or metabolic pathways that are essential for all stages of the parasite life cycle but are either absent or fundamentally different in the human host. Such targets can be identified either by whole-genome comparisons or by directed analyses of specific cellular transactions. Here we analyze the mRNA capping apparatus of T. brucei. The m7GpppN cap structure (cap 0) is a defining feature of eukaryotic mRNA and is required for mRNA stability and efficient translation. The cap is formed by three enzymatic reactions: the 5′ triphosphate end of the nascent pre-mRNA is hydrolyzed to a diphosphate by RNA triphosphatase; the diphosphate end is capped with GMP by RNA guanylyltransferase; and the GpppN cap is methylated by RNA (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase (5Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Each of the mRNA capping enzymes is essential for cell growth in budding yeast. Although the three capping reactions are universal in eukaryotes, there is a surprising diversity in the genetic organization of the cap-forming enzymes in different taxa as well as a complete divergence in the structure and catalytic mechanism of the RNA triphosphatase component as one moves from lower to higher eukaryotic species (5Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). Metazoans and plants have a two-component capping system consisting of a bifunctional triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase polypeptide and a separate methyltransferase polypeptide, whereas fungi and the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi have a three-component system consisting of separate triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and methyltransferase gene products (5Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar). 1Hausmann, S., Vivares, C., and Shuman, S. (2001)J. Biol. Chem., in press. The primary structures and biochemical mechanisms of the fungal and mammalian guanylyltransferases and cap methyltransferases are conserved. However, the atomic structures and catalytic mechanisms of the fungal and mammalian RNA triphosphatases are completely different (7Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 8Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that RNA triphosphatase is a promising target for antifungal drug discovery (7Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the organization of the mRNA capping apparatus in the many other branches of the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree, especially the protozoa. We recently identified the guanylyltransferase and triphosphatase enzymes from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and we showed that thePlasmodium triphosphatase is structurally and mechanistically similar to the metal-dependent fungal enzymes (9Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An evolutionary connection between plasmodia and fungi had not been appreciated in previous schemes of molecular taxonomy. Trypanosome mRNAs contain a unique hypermodified “cap 4” structure, which is derived from the standard m7GpppN cap by cotranscriptional methylation of seven sites within the first four nucleosides of the spliced leader RNA (10Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mair G. Ullu E. Tschudi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28994-28999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although cap formation is (in principle) an attractive target for drug treatment of trypanosomiasis, the pathway of cap synthesis has not been fully determined. An RNA guanylyltransferase has been characterized inTrypanosoma and Crithidia (12Silva E. Ullu E. Kobayashi R. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4612-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but the triphosphatase and several methyltransferase components have not been identified. The T. brucei guanylyltransferase is mechanistically and structurally related to the guanylyltransferases from all other eukaryal species (and thus is not an especially attractive drug target). However, the 586-amino acid T. brucei guanylyltransferase contains a 250-amino acid N-terminal extension not found in fungal or metazoan guanylyltransferases; it has been speculated that this extra domain (also present inCrithidia guanylyltransferase) might contribute the triphosphatase activity during cap synthesis (12Silva E. Ullu E. Kobayashi R. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4612-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of the triphosphatase component of the T. brucei capping apparatus as the product of a separate gene, which we named TbCET1. The TbCet1 enzyme is structurally and mechanistically related to the fungal andPlasmodium RNA triphosphatases. Indeed, TbCet1 is active in cap formation in vivo when expressed in budding yeast. We discuss the pharmacological and evolutionary implications of these results. A DNA fragment containing the TbCET1 open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from T. bruceigenomic DNA (a gift of Vivian Bellofatto, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) using oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce an NcoI restriction site at the predicted translation start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the predicted stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested withNcoI and BamHI and cloned into the yeast vector pYX132 (CEN TRP1). TbCET1 expression is under the transcriptional control of the yeast TPI1 promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the T. brucei DNA insert was determined and was found to be identical to the genomic sequence (GenBankTM accession number AC091330). TheTbCET1 open reading frame was excised from pYX-TbCET1 withNcoI and BamHI, and the 5′ overhangs were filled in with T4 DNA polymerase. The blunt DNA fragment was inserted into the filled-in BamHI site of pET28-His/Smt3 (a gift of Chris Lima, Cornell Medical College) to fuse the open reading frame in-frame to N-terminal His6/Smt3. pET-His/Smt3-TbCet1 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3). A 200-ml culture amplified from a single transformant was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 60 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A 600reached 0.5. The culture was adjusted to 2% ethanol and 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then incubated at 17 °C for 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Cell lysis was achieved by addition of lysozyme and Triton X-100 to final concentrations of 100 μg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extract was applied to a 1-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with 5 ml of the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 2-ml aliquots of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100) containing 5, 50, 100, 200, and 500 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 45-kDa recombinant His/Smt3-TbCet1 polypeptide was recovered in the 50 and 100 mm imidazole fractions. The 100 mmimidazole eluate fraction (containing 3 mg of protein) was used to characterize the triphosphatase activity of TbCet1. Metazoan and plant RNA triphosphatases belong to the cysteine phosphate enzyme superfamily, which is defined by the conserved phosphate-binding loop motif HCXXXXXR(S/T). Mammalian RNA triphosphatase catalyzes a two-step ping-pong phosphoryl transfer reaction in which the conserved cysteine of the signature motif attacks the γ phosphorus of triphosphate-terminated RNA to form a covalent protein-cysteinyl-S-phosphate intermediate and expel the diphosphate RNA product (8Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate is hydrolyzed to liberate inorganic phosphate. The reaction does not require a divalent cation cofactor. In contrast, the RNA triphosphatases of fungal species such asSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, andSchizosaccharomyces pombe are strictly dependent on a divalent cation. The fungal enzymes belong to a new family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases that embraces the triphosphatase components of the poxvirus, baculovirus,Chlorella virus, and P. falciparum mRNA capping systems (13Ho C.K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 387-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signature biochemical property of this enzyme family is the ability to hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates and inorganic phosphate in the presence of either manganese or cobalt. The defining structural features of the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases are two glutamate-containing motifs (β1 and β11 in Fig.1) that are required for catalysis by every family member and that comprise the metal-binding site. The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase Cet1 revealed a novel tertiary structure in which the active site is situated within a topologically closed hydrophilic tunnel composed of eight antiparallel β strands (7Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The β strands comprising the tunnel walls are displayed over the Cet1 protein sequence in Fig. 1. Each of the eight strands contributes at least one functional constituent of the active site (13Ho C.K. Pei Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34151-34156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Pei Y. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17261-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The 15 individual side chains within the tunnel that are important for Cet1 function in vitro and in vivo are denoted by dots in Fig. 1. We searched for a candidate RNA triphosphatase in T. bruceiby querying the Microbial Genomes Database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Microb_blast) for proteins related to theS. pombe RNA triphosphatase Pct1. We thereby identified a putative RNA triphosphatase gene on T. brucei chromosome III (DNA sequence in GenBankTM accession number AC091330) that encodes a 252-amino acid polypeptide (shown in Fig.2 A) with primary structural similarity to the catalytic domains of fungal, viral, andPlasmodium RNA triphosphatases (Fig. 1). We named thisT. brucei gene product TbCet1 (cappingenzyme triphosphatase). TbCet1 is slightly larger than the “minimal” RNA triphosphatases ofChlorella virus PBCV-1 (cvRtp1; 193 amino acids) andE. cuniculi (EcCet1; 221 amino acids) but is smaller than the RNA triphosphatases of P. falciparum (Prt1; 596 amino acids), S. cerevisiae (Cet1; 549 amino acids), C. albicans (CaCat1; 520 amino acids), and S. pombe (Pct1; 303 amino acids). Cet1 and CaCet1 contain large nonessential N-terminal extensions (22Lehman K. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Rouzankina I. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22668-22678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Schwer B. Lehman K. Saha N. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1857-1864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that are missing from the T. bruceiprotein. TbCet1 includes the two metal binding motifs characteristic of the fungal, viral, and Plasmodium triphosphatases plus putative homologs of all of the other β strands that comprise the active site tunnel of Cet1 (Fig. 2). Indeed, all of the 15 hydrophilic amino acids that are essential for catalysis by Cet1 are conserved in the T. brucei polypeptide, which suggested strongly that TbCet1 is the RNA triphosphatase component of the trypanosome mRNA capping apparatus. The TbCET1 gene was cloned into a T7 RNA polymerase-based pET vector to fuse the protein in-frame with an N-terminal His6-Smt3 tag (24Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The recombinant TbCet1 protein was purified from a soluble bacterial extract by adsorption to nickel-agarose and elution with 50 and 100 mm imidazole (Fig. 1 B). We found that recombinant TbCet1 catalyzed the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of manganese and that the extent of ATP hydrolysis was proportional to enzyme concentration; the reaction proceeded to completion at saturating enzyme (Fig. 1 C). We calculated a specific activity of 1.3 nmol of 32Pi formed/ng of TbCet1 during a 15-min reaction, which corresponded to a turnover number of 65 s−1. There was no detectable ATPase activity in the absence of a divalent cation (Fig.3 A). Hydrolysis of 0.2 mm ATP was optimal at 2 mm MnCl2and declined slightly at 5–10 mm MnCl2 (Fig.3 A). Activity with magnesium (10 mm) was 6% of that observed at 2 mm manganese (Fig. 3 A). Specificity for NTP hydrolysis in the presence of manganese is characteristic of the fungal-type RNA triphosphatase family. Triphosphatase activity was optimal at pH 7.5 in Tris buffer and declined sharply as the pH was lowered to 5.0 or increased to 9.0 (Fig.3 B). The rate of release of 32Pifrom [γ-32P]ATP was nearly identical to the rate of conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP in a parallel reaction mixture containing the same concentration of TbCet1 (Fig. 3 C). We detected no formation of [α-32P]AMP during the reaction. Hence, we conclude that TbCet1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi. TbCet1 also converts [α-32P]GTP to [α-32P]GDP (not shown). We cloned theTbCET1 gene into a yeast CEN TRP1 plasmid under the transcriptional control of the constitutive yeast TPI1promoter. The function of the TbCET1 gene was first tested by plasmid shuffle in yeast cet1Δ cells that containCET1 on a CEN URA3 plasmid. Thecet1Δ strain is unable to form colonies on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA),2 a drug that selects against the URA3 plasmid unless it is transformed with a second plasmid bearing CET1 or a functional homolog from another source. We found that TbCET1 was unable to complement growth of cet1Δ on 5-FOA (Fig.4 A). This negative result was not surprising given that TbCet1 lacks an essential domain of Cet1 that mediates its binding to the yeast guanylyltransferase Ceg1 (25Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ceg1 is exquisitely labile and stabilized against inactivation by binding to Cet1 (26Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36116-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The requirement for the guanylyltransferase binding and stabilization functions of Cet1 can be circumvented in vivoby replacing the endogenous S. cerevisiaeguanylyltransferase with an inherently stable guanylyltransferase,e.g. Mce1-(211–597), the guanylyltransferase domain of mammalian capping enzyme (26Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36116-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Takase Y. Takagi T. Komarnitsky P.B. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9307-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of the TbCET1 gene was tested again by plasmid shuffle in yeast cet1Δ ceg1Δ cells that contain CET1 on a CEN URA3 plasmid andMCE1-(211–597) on a CEN ADE2 plasmid. We found that TbCET1 now supported growth on 5-FOA, whereas cells transformed with the TRP1 vector alone did not (Fig.4 B). The cells expressing TbCET1 plusMCE1-(211–597) grew as well as MCE1 cells on rich medium (YPD agar) at 25, 30, and 37 °C (not shown). These results show that TbCET1 encodes a biologically active RNA triphosphatase. Kinetoplast mRNAs acquire their 5′ caps via trans-splicing of an RNA leader sequence containing the hypermethylated cap 4 structure (10Bangs J.D. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. McCloskey J.A. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9805-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mair G. Ullu E. Tschudi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28994-28999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The presence of a distinctive N-terminal domain in the RNA guanylyltransferases of T. brucei and C. fasciculata, which contains a putative nucleotide binding motif, raised the possibility that the N-terminal segment comprises the triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus (12Silva E. Ullu E. Kobayashi R. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4612-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but there is as yet no biochemical evidence for a triphosphatase activity associated with the T. brucei guanylyltransferase. Here we demonstrated that T. brucei encodes a separate RNA triphosphatase, TbCet1, which is structurally and mechanistically akin to the metal-dependent RNA triphosphatases of fungi and the malaria parasite P. falciparum. The finding that TbCet1 complements the cet1Δ mutation in budding yeast confirms that the T. brucei protein can function as a cap-forming enzyme in vivo. TbCet1 is an attractive therapeutic target for trypanosomiasis because (i) the active site structure and catalytic mechanism of TbCet1 is completely different from the RNA triphosphatase domain of the metazoan RNA capping enzyme, and (ii) metazoans encode no identifiable homologs of the fungal or protozoal RNA triphosphatases. Thus, a mechanism-based inhibitor of TbCet1 should be highly selective for the kinetoplastid parasite and have minimal effect on the human host. Given the central role of the mRNA cap in eukaryotic gene expression, a drug that targets TbCet1 would presumably be effective at all stages of the life cycle of the parasite. Also, the structural similarity between T. brucei, P. falciparum, and fungal RNA triphosphatases raises the exciting possibility of achieving antitrypanosomal, antimalarial, and antifungal activity with a single class of mechanism-based inhibitors. We have suggested that capping enzymes are a good focal point for considering eukaryotic evolution because (i) the mRNA cap structure is ubiquitous in eukarya but absent from the bacterial and archaeal domains, and (ii) differences in the capping apparatus between taxa will reflect events that postdate the emergence of ancestral nucleated cells (9Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3050-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We proposed a heuristic scheme of eukaryotic phylogeny based on two features of the mRNA capping apparatus: the structure and mechanism of the triphosphatase component (metal-dependent “fungal” type versus metal-independent cysteine phosphatase type) and whether the triphosphatase is physically linked in cis to the guanylyltransferase component. By these simple criteria, relying on fundamental differences in the same metabolic pathway, one arrives at different relationships among taxa than those suggested by comparisons of sequence variations among proteins that are themselves highly conserved in all eukaryotes (28Baldauf S.L. Roger A.J. Wenk-Siefart I. Doolittle W.F. Science. 2000; 290: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). For example, the capping-based phylogeny would place metazoans in a common lineage with Viridiplantae (exemplified by the metaphytaArabidopsis and the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) because all of these organisms have a cysteine phosphatase-type RNA triphosphatase fused to their guanylyltransferase (Fig. 5). Fungi, microsporidia, plasmodia (which are classified as Apicomplexa along with other pathogenic parasites Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidia), and nowTrypanosoma (which are classified as Euglenozoa along with the human parasite Leishmania) fall into a different lineage distinguished by a “Cet1-like” RNA triphosphatase that is physically separate from RNA guanylyltransferase. In contrast, the protein sequence variation-based scheme proposed by Baldauf et al. (28Baldauf S.L. Roger A.J. Wenk-Siefart I. Doolittle W.F. Science. 2000; 290: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) places fungi in the same supergroup as metazoa and puts the Apicomplexa nearer to plants. Assuming that multicellular animals evolved from unicellular ancestors, we envision that the three-component capping system with a metal-dependent triphosphatase is the ancestral state from which other eukarya (and their viruses) evolved (Fig. 5). We see evidence of evolution in two directions. Certain viruses (poxviruses, baculoviruses, and African swine fever virus) and fungal cytoplasmic episomes have acquired bifunctional capping enzymes by fusion of the ancestral triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase genes (6Tiggemann M. Jeske S. Larsen M. Meinhardt F. Yeast. 2001; 18: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Jin J. Dong W. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10011-10019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10020-10028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. J.

Metazoans and plants have experienced a different gene rearrangement event that transferred a cysteine phosphatase domain into the same transcription unit as the guanylyltransferase, leading to creation of the triphosphatase-guanylyltransferase fusion protein that we see today. A plausible pathway of evolution could entail the appearance of a new cysteine phosphatase enzyme (e.g. via duplication and mutation of one of the protein phosphatase genes present in lower eukarya) that gained the capacity to hydrolyze an RNA 5′ phosphate instead of, or in addition to, a phosphoprotein (Fig. 5). The model implies a “transition state” wherein an organism contained both a metal-dependent and a cysteine phosphatase-type triphosphatase. The fusion of the cysteine phosphatase to the guanylyltransferase presumably allowed for the loss of the Cet1-like enzyme from the genome of the common metazoan/plant ancestor or else the divergence of the protein to a point that it is no longer discernable as Cet1-like. The alternative explanation would be that plants and metazoans independently experienced this gene fusion in distant branches of the phylogenetic tree, a prospect that seems less appealing to us. The scheme is useful in that it raises some interesting questions about missing links and the order of events in the progression from fungal- and protozoal-type to metazoan- and plant-type capping systems. It is surely oversimplified because it is based on knowledge of only a fraction of eukaryal taxa. As more genomes are sequenced, we may encounter species that have a Cet1-like triphosphatase fused to a guanylyltransferase, others with a cysteine phosphatase-type RNA triphosphatase that participates in cap formation but is physically separate from the guanylyltransferase, and yet others that encode a novel class of RNA triphosphatase enzyme. Of particular interest will be the characterization of the mRNA capping apparatus in the most primitive protozoan and metazoan organisms."

Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar).

However, for other, perhaps most proteins, concentrations of the proteins are increased in the COPII transport vesicles, and the kinetics of transport are faster than expected for a bulk flow model, which indicates that exit from the ER is a selective process mediated by positive sorting signals (1Rothman J.E.

The sorting signals, by interaction with coat proteins or vesicle membrane proteins, mediate concentration of secretory and membrane proteins in selected regions of the ER, where they are packaged into the transport vesicles (5Mellman I. Warren G. Cell. 2000; 100: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 6Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). In the absence of sorting signals, proteins would not be concentrated in transport vesicles but could still be slowly transported from the ER by bulk flow unless other sorting signals or properties of the protein prevent their incorporation into the transport vesicle. Primary determinants mediating localization of membrane proteins to the ER, Golgi, or plasma membrane have been mostly mapped to their TMDs (7Letourneur F. Cosson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33273-33278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Rayner J.C. Pelham H.R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). There is no obvious difference in the lengths or sequences of TMDs of ER and Golgi membrane proteins; however, it has been suggested that the length of the TMD is the main discriminatory factor between Golgi and plasma membrane proteins (9Bretscher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 10Munro S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4695-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Consistent with the increasing thickness of the lipid bilayer along the secretory pathway, TMDs of the plasma membrane are longer than those of the Golgi. Moreover, for some ER membrane proteins, simple extension of the TMD was sufficient for targeting to the Golgi and plasma membrane (11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J. Weissman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition to length, both the distribution of hydrophobicity and polar residues in the TMD are also part of the sorting determinants (13Reggiori F. Black M.W. Pelham H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Szczesna-Skorupa E.

Extramembranous sequences have been also found to strongly affect sorting of proteins to the ER, Golgi, or plasma membrane (16Cosson P. Letourneur F.

Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to the already mentioned positive sorting signals, these sequences may contain localization determinants that prevent transport to the next compartment, thus functioning as negative or true retention signals (20Misumi Y. Sohda M. Tashiro A. Sato H. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6867-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl.

Biophys. 2000; 374: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This may be the mechanism used by some integral ER membrane proteins lacking any known sorting signals, which are excluded from export to the pre-Golgi compartment. Lack of transport from the ER as a consequence of incorporation of membrane proteins into large immobile networks has also been postulated (23Gaynor E.C. te Heesen S. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 24Ivessa N.E. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Tsao Y.S. Takatsuki A. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism fails to explain the ER retention of proteins that have been shown to have high lateral mobility (25Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Li Y. Smith T. Grabski S. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29830-29837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sorting signals or properties of the proteins that prevent the incorporation of these mobile proteins into transport vesicles are not well understood. Either the proteins could be actively targeted to regions of the ER not involved in transport vesicle formation or some property of the protein could be incompatible with inclusion in the transport vesicle. Cytochrome P-450 (P-450) 2C1/2 is inserted into the ER membrane via its N-terminal signal anchor sequence, which functions as an ER retention sequence, independently of the ER retention also mediated by the catalytic, cytoplasmic domain (27Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have shown that the 28-amino acid signal anchor sequence of cytochrome P-450 2C1 prevents incorporation into the transport vesicles, resulting in static ER retention of either P-450 2C1 or chimeric proteins (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Deletion of the 7-amino acid linker sequence following the TMD or mutation of the sequence 21KQS23 in the linker resulted in chimeras that were no longer statically retained in the ER but were retained in the ER by retrieval from the intermediate compartment. Mutagenesis of the P-450 2C1 TMD indicated that ER retention mediated by the N-terminal 28 amino acids depended not only on its length but also on the distribution of the hydrophobic residues. These results suggest that the specific position or orientation of the TMD in the membrane determines whether the protein is incorporated into transport vesicles, possibly by properly positioning the linker sequence. We have shown that the ER retention function of the signal anchor of cytochrome P-450 2C1 is dependent on its position in the protein. If the signal anchor was fused to the C terminus of the extracellular domain of EGFR or substituted for the TMD of EGFR, the resulting chimeric proteins were exported from the ER in transfected COS1 cells (27Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). If the large luminal domain in these chimeric proteins alters the position of the TMD in the membrane, then changing the length of the hydrophobic core or altering the distribution of the hydrophobicity might be able to restore the ER retention function. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of deletions of hydrophobic residues in the TMD and the effect of mutations in the linker sequence on the ER retention function of the signal anchor in an internal or C-terminal position. Our results demonstrate that in these positions, the native P-450 2C1 signal anchor does not mediate ER retention unless its TMD core is shortened in the C-terminal region, which may bring the linker residues KQS that are critical for ER retention closer to the lipid bilayer.

The construction of chimeras ECE (EGFR with its transmembrane domain replaced by the P-450 2C1 signal anchor) and ECO (ECE with the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR deleted) in the pCMV vector has been described (27Szczesna-Skorupa E.

To construct chimera EC/GFP, in which the GFP coding sequence is attached to the C terminus of the P-450 2C1 signal anchor, plasmid ECC (27Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J.

All mutations of the P-450 N-terminal signal anchor were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using a set of designed primers and ECO or EC/GFP DNA as a template. Construction of a plasmid encoding a glycosylation tag at the C terminus of GFP and of chimera C1/GFP (C1(1–28)/GFP) was described previously (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To construct chimera PTH/GFP, a DNA sequence encoding the 27-amino acid secretory signal sequence of preproparathyroid hormone was amplified from the vector pTP6 (28Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) using the T7 promoter primer as a 5′ primer and a 3′ primer with a KpnI site. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with HindIII and KpnI and inserted into HindIII/KpnI-digested pEGFP-N1 and with or without the glycosylation tag at the C terminus. COS1 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Biosynthetic labeling of the transfected cells, immunoprecipitation, and endoglycosidase H and N-glycosidase F treatment were performed as described (25Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1757-1762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For fluorescent microscopy, transfected cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescent staining as described (25Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The ER retention function of the P-450 2C1 signal anchor (amino acids 1–28) placed either internally or at the C terminus of a transmembrane protein has been tested in chimeras ECE and ECO (Fig. 1). The luminal domain of EGFR is glycosylated so the resistance to cleavage of the carbohydrate side chains by endo H can be used to determine whether the protein is transported to at least the medial Golgi from the ER. Previously we showed that both ECO and ECE were exported from the ER in transfected COS1 cells (27Szczesna-Skorupa E. Ahn K. Chen C.-D. Doray B. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24327-24333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, an internal or C-terminal position of the P-450 signal anchor peptide eliminates its ER retention property, which might be related to a change in its position or orientation in the membrane. Lengthening the TMD of some C-terminally anchored ER membrane proteins can lead to their transport out of the ER (11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J. Weissman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To test whether the length of the hydrophobic core of a C-terminally positioned P-450 signal anchor sequence affects its function, we deleted three Leu residues from the C-terminal side of the TMD (Fig. 1, positions 15–17) in chimera ECO. Transfected COS1 cells were pulse-labeled, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were digested with endo H. As expected, ECO was resistant to cleavage of its side chains by endo H, indicating that this chimera was transported from the ER. In contrast, the chimera with the hydrophobic core shortened at its C terminus, EC(−3L)O was localized to the ER, as shown by the complete sensitivity of its carbohydrate side chains to cleavage by endo H (Fig.2 A). This could be the result either of the overall shortening of the TMD or of a change in hydrophobicity of its C-terminal region. To distinguish between these possibilities, the three Val at positions 4–6 at the N-terminal side of the TMD (Fig. 1) were deleted. In contrast to the C-terminal deletion, the carbohydrate side chains of the N-terminal mutant were resistant to endo H digestion (Fig. 2 A), as in ECO, so that the signal anchor with three valines deleted did not regain an ER retention function. These results suggest that the specific distribution of the hydrophobic residues in the TMD is an important determinant for ER retention. In the ECO context the P-450 signal anchor is at the C terminus of the chimeric protein, whereas in ECE, which is also transported from the ER, it is followed by a large cytoplasmic domain of EGFR that could potentially contain positive transport signals. To examine whether the characteristics of the signal anchor were similar in an internal position when flanked by a reporter that normally is not localized to the plasma membrane, ECO and its deletion mutants were fused to the N terminus of GFP. The localization of these fluorescent proteins in the cells was consistent with the studies with ECO. EC/GFP and EC(−3V)/GFP were transported out of the ER as indicated by an intracellular fluorescence pattern different from ER localization (compare with Fig.4 A, C1/GFP) and by the presence of fluorescence at the surface of the cells (Fig. 2 B, left panels). The location of the proteins at the surface of the cell was supported by the detection of the chimera (as well as endogenous EGFR) on the surface of unpermeabilized cells by an antibody against the extracellular domain of EGFR and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 2 B, right panels). In contrast, cells expressing EC(−3L)/GFP had a reticular cytoplasmic pattern characteristic of ER localization (Fig. 2 B, left panel) that was clearly different from the surface localization of EGFR (Fig. 2 B, right panel). The presence of GFP did not affect the distribution of the proteins in the cell because the endoglycosidase H sensitivity of the GFP chimeras was the same as that of the corresponding proteins without GFP (data not shown). In both the C-terminal and internal positions, therefore, deletions on the C-terminal side but not the N-terminal side, of the TMD resulted in a gain of ER retention function. These results are consistent with previous studies of the signal anchor in its normal N-terminal position, in which mutations in the C-terminal side of the TMD had the greatest effect on ER retention function (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Studies on the signal anchor in its normal N-terminal position showed that both the TMD and the linker region contribute to its ER retention function (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Specific mutations of the sequence KQS in the linker interfered with ER retention, whereas changes in the distribution and number of hydrophobic residues primarily in the C-terminal half of the TMD blocked retention (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these results was that the orientation or position of the linker sequence or the C-terminal half of the TMD relative to the membrane was critical for ER retention. If the mechanism for ER retention mediated by the signal anchor in an internal or C-terminal position is the same as when it is in the N-terminal region, then the KQS sequence in the linker should also be important for retention mediated by the C-terminal or internal signal anchor. Our previous studies with chimeras containing an N-terminally positioned signal anchor showed that mutation of both Lys21and Ser23 (K21N and S23V) in the linker largely eliminated static ER retention. We therefore analyzed the effect of mutating these residues in chimera EC(−3L)/GFP. Surprisingly, the carbohydrate side chains of this mutant, EC(−3L)/NQV/GFP, remained sensitive to endo H digestion (Fig.3 A). Consistent with this observation, the fluorescence of this mutant was not localized to the plasma membrane; however, the distribution was not typical of ER localization either (Fig. 3 B, left panel). Instead, the fluorescence was localized in a perinuclear region, which indicates that the protein was not retained efficiently in the ER. The pattern of GFP fluorescence suggests that the protein is transported to the Golgi. The distribution of fluorescence is similar to that of thecis-Golgi marker protein GM130 (30Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), which was detected by its antibody and visualized with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 3 B, right panel). The sensitivity of the carbohydrate side chains to cleavage with endo H suggested that the mutant was transported no further than the cis-Golgi (31Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar). To further examine the importance of the KQS linker sequence, we analyzed the effect on subcellular localization of substituting three alanines for 21KQS23 (Fig. 1). In contrast to EC(−3L)/GFP, significant resistance to endo H digestion of the carbohydrate side chains was observed for this mutant, which indicates that it is not efficiently retained in the ER (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the distribution of the fluorescence in cells expressing the EC(−3L)/AAA/GFP chimera, which includes fluorescence at the surface of the cells, indicates that the protein is not retained in the ER but is transported to the cell surface (Fig. 3 B,left panel). To address the possibility that this effect is caused by the elimination of the positively charged Lys21, which effectively extends the TMD by three amino acids, we also tested a mutant with only residues 22 and 23 (QS) substituted by alanines. This mutant, EC(−3L)/KAA/GFP, is also transported from the ER, as shown by its resistance to endo H digestion (Fig. 3 A) and the presence of the fluorescent protein in the plasma membrane (Fig.3 B, left panel). For both EC(−3L)/AAA/GFP and EC(−3L)/KAA/GFP, detection of the extracellular domain of EFGR on the surface of the cells provides further evidence that the chimeras are transported from the ER to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 B,right panels). The requirement for the linker sequence KQS for ER retention when the (−3L) signal anchor is present at the C terminus or internally indicates that the mechanism for retention is the same when the signal anchor is present in these positions as when it is present at the N terminus. In previous studies on the requirements for the ER retention mediated by the P-450 2C1 signal anchor in its normal N-terminal position, we demonstrated that lengthening the TMD resulted in a loss of ER retention, but mutations that shortened the TMD were not studied (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because deletion of three leucines had dramatic effects on signal anchor retention function when the signal anchor was C-terminal or internal, whereas deletion of three valines did not, we examined the effects of these mutations on the N-terminally located signal anchor. In agreement with previous studies (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the fluorescent distribution of C1/GFP was consistent with an ER localization (Fig. 4 A). The deletion of either three leucines or three valines, however, altered the targeting function of the signal anchor, and the proteins were no longer inserted as type 1 membrane proteins, so that the effect on ER retention could not be determined. The diffuse pattern observed with C1(−3L)/GFP is consistent with a cytoplasmic distribution (Fig.4 A), which indicates that this deletion inhibited the targeting of the protein to the ER. The C1(−3V)/GFP mutant exhibited a punctate pattern of fluorescence, suggesting that it had been translocated across the ER membrane and transported through the secretory pathway to transport vesicles. Several observations supported this conclusion. First, treatment of the cells with brefeldin A, which prevents forward transport from the ER and leads to retrograde transport of Golgi proteins to the ER, resulted in a reticular pattern of fluorescence consistent with ER retention (not shown). Second, after radiolabeling and a prolonged chase, small amounts of protein immunoreactive to GFP antisera are present in the medium of transfected cells (Fig. 4 B). Similar amounts of the protein are present in the medium of cells transfected with a chimera containing the secretory signal sequence of parathyroid hormone fused to GFP, PTH/GFP (Fig. 4 B). Finally, a 29-amino acid glycosylation tag (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was placed at the C terminus of C1(−3V)/GFP and PTH/GFP. Glycosylation of the tag would indicate that the protein was translocated across the ER membrane. In both cases, a fraction of the radiolabeled protein had a slower electrophoretic mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, suggesting that it had been glycosylated (Fig.4 C). This was confirmed by the elimination of the slower mobility protein by treatment with N-glycosidase F, which removes carbohydrate side chains. Thus, whereas deletion of three leucines or three valines in the TMD of the P-450 signal anchor does not affect its stop transfer and membrane anchor properties when the TMD is internal or C-terminally located, the same mutations in the N-terminally located signal anchor either inhibit ER targeting (−3L) or convert it to a translocation signal that is presumably cleaved (−3V). Mutations in either the TMD or the following linker sequence can interfere with the static ER retention function of the P-450 2C1 signal anchor sequence when in its normal N-terminal location (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Such mutations in the TMD were relatively nonspecific with regard to the sequence but altered the length of the hydrophobic core or the distribution of hydrophobic residues. In general, mutations in the C-terminal half of the TMD had greater effects. In the linker sequence, the specific sequence KQS was important for static ER retention. The more specific sequence requirement in the linker suggested that this sequence might interact with other proteins. These results led to a proposal that the orientation and position of the C-terminal portion of the TMD and the linker sequence relative to the membrane were important for ER retention. When the P-450 2C1 signal anchor is placed in an internal or C-terminal position, its ER retention function is lost. In terms of the proposed model, a large luminal domain may alter the position of the TMD in the membrane, which in turn affects the position of the KQS sequence. The size of the luminal domain may be important because fusion of a smaller 29-amino acid glycosylation tag sequence to the N terminus did not affect ER retention (15Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19409-19415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by the observation that reducing the length of the C-terminally or internally positioned TMD by deletions in its C-terminal portion restored ER retention function. This dependence on length is similar to the observation that ER retention of cytochromeb5 was lost when its C-terminal TMD was lengthened (11Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The inability of the mutant with deletion of three valines from the N-terminal portion of the signal anchor to restore ER retention is more difficult to explain from this model but may indicate that the length of the TMD is less important than its orientation,i.e. the degree of slant in the membrane. Because the TMD requirements for ER retention are different depending on the position of the signal anchor, it is possible that the mechanisms for ER retention are different. If different mechanisms are involved, then the KQS sequence in the linker region might not be as important for the ER retention function of the signal anchor in a C-terminal or internal position as it is in the N-terminally located signal anchor. However, substitution of Ala either for KQS or QS or substitution of NQV for KQS resulted in transport from the ER of chimeras containing the signal anchor in an internal or C-terminal position. The requirement for the KQS sequence regardless of position suggests that the mechanisms are the same and that both the TMD and the juxtamembrane linker sequence are required for ER retention. Sorting determinants for transmembrane proteins have been identified in juxtamembrane sequences on both the cytosolic and luminal sides of the membrane. Positive sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins contribute to targeting in the secretory pathway and endocytosis and to basolateral membranes in polarized cells (reviewed in Ref. 6Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Similarly, a short juxtamembrane domain mediates the sorting of MAL to specific membrane microdomains (32Puertollano R. Alonso M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12740-12745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A negative cytoplasmic retention signal is required for localization of Golgi proteins (19Milland J.

Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A conserved sequence motif that mediates the targeting has not been identified in any of these cases. The KQS motif identified in our studies as being required for the ER retention function of the P-450 2C1 signal anchor has not been described previously as a sorting signal. This sequence is not highly conserved in P-450s. KQS and similar sequences (RQS and RQV) are present in many P-450 2C subfamily members and in the most closely related subfamily, P-450 2E (KQI and RQV) but not in most other P-450s. In human P-450 2E1, which has an RQV sequence, the signal anchor does not mediate static ER retention (22Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C. Kemper B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ER retention, therefore, appears to be mediated by different mechanisms for different P-450s. Whether the use of the KQS motif as a retention signal in P-450 2C proteins is related to a unique physiological function is not known. Deletions within the hydrophobic core of the P-450 2C1 signal anchor, when in its normal N-terminal position, had dramatically different effects on its targeting function depending on whether the N- or C-terminal portion of the TMD was shortened. These results agree with earlier observations of Sato et al. (38Sato T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), who showed that for the signal anchor of rabbit P-450 IA1, N-terminal deletions caused translocation and processing of the protein, whereas C-terminal deletions eliminated interaction with the membrane resulting in a cytosolic protein. These data are consistent with the loop model of signal sequence insertion, in which the C terminus of the signal enters the membrane first, so that its hydrophobicity may be more critical for membrane interaction (39Shaw A.S. Rottier P.J. Rose J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7592-7596Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Different results were obtained with the signal anchor of cytochrome P-450 M1. This signal anchor mediated ER translocation with either N-terminal or C-terminal deletions, which probably reflects different sequences of these signal anchors or the systems used: cell-free translation-translocation versustransfected cells (38Sato T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The loss of ER retention function of the P-450 2C1 signal anchor in a C-terminal position differs from the continued ER retention function mediated by the 21-amino acid TMD of the closely related P-450 M1 signal anchor fused to the C terminus of carboxyesterase (40Murakami K. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The differences in the two experiments may be related to the nature of the luminal domain, which could have different effects on the signal anchor sequence. For instance, in terms of the model described above, carboxyesterase may perturb the membrane position of the P-450 TMD less than the luminal domain of EGFR. Surprisingly, deletion of 15 of the 21 amino acids of the M1 TMD, leaving only four core hydrophobic residues, did not affect its ER retention function (40Murakami K. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for the different results might be that the mechanism for ER retention in this fusion protein is unrelated to the normal mechanism mediated by the signal anchor in the N-terminal position. TMDs play a critical role as sorting signals for multiple organelles. The targeting may result from preference of a TMD for membranes with specific lipid compositions or thickness or by more specific interactions with lipids or helices of other membrane proteins. The distribution of polar residues in TMDs has been shown to be important for sorting, which suggests that interactions with other proteins may be involved. In addition to these direct interactions of the TMD with membrane components, the TMD may also determine the position relative to the membrane of juxtamembrane sequences, such as the KQS motif described in this paper, which is critical for proper sorting. In this case, the TMD would be a relatively passive anchor, whereas the juxtamembrane sequence would be the primary signal for sorting."

We previously showed that LiCl interacts synergistically with all-trans-retinoic acid to promote terminal differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ cells, a phenomenon accompanied by the recovery of the retinoid-induced loss of retinoic acid receptor α protein pools. Here, we demonstrate the effects of LiCl on proteasome-dependent degradation of retinoic acid receptor α proteins. LiCl alone, or in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid, increased cellular levels of ubiquitinated retinoic acid receptor α and markedly reduced chymotryptic-like activity of WEHI-3B D+ 20 S and 26 S proteasome enzymes. Neither KCl nor all-trans-retinoic acid affected enzyme activity, whereas NaCl produced a modest reduction at relatively high concentrations. In addition, LiCl inhibited 20 S proteasome chymotryptic-like activity from rabbits but had no effect on tryptic-like activity of the 26 S proteasome. This effect has significant consequences in stabilizing the retinoic acid receptor α protein levels that are necessary to promote continued differentiation of leukemia cells in response to all-trans-retinoic acid. In support of this concept, combination of proteasome inhibitors β-clastolactacystin or benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Phe with all-trans-retinoic acid increased differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ cells in a manner that was analogous to the combination of LiCl and all-trans-retinoic acid.

Klein P.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 789-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Pharmacological doses of lithium cause stabilization of bipolar disorder, developmental defects, subclinical hypothyroidism, and increased neutrophil production (2Price L.H. Heninger G.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 3Kao K.R. Masui Y. Elinson R.P. Nature. 1986; 322: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Boggs D.R. Joyce R.A. Semin. Hematol. 1983; 20: 129-138PubMed Google Scholar). Lithium has been proposed to impede G-protein-coupled signaling cascades because of a depletion of intracellular inositol by direct inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (5Hallcher L.M. Sherman W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10896-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lithium also inhibits glycogen synthase kinase, which can lead to signaling of the wnt pathway through β-catenin (6Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown previously that lithium chloride, in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA),1 causes synergistic induction of the differentiation of WEHI-3B D+myelomonocytic leukemia cells and reverses the down-regulation of retinoic acid receptor α protein (RARα) produced by ATRA (7Sokoloski J.A. Li J. Nigam A. Sartorelli A.C. Leuk. Res. 1993; 17: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Finch R.A. Li J. Chou T.C. Sartorelli A.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the down-regulation of RARα by ATRA has been reported to occur in acute promyelocytic leukemia and in breast cancer cells by specific targeting of the receptors to the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway (9Zhu J. Gianni M. Kopf E. Honore N. Chelbi-Alix M. Koken M. Quignon F. Rochette-Egly C. de The H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14807-14812Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 10Tanaka T. Rodriguez de la Concepcon M.L. De Luca L.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that lithium may exert some of its effects by targeting a component of the proteasome-dependent degradation system. The implication of proteasome-dependent degradation mediating important cellular events has been the subject of numerous studies to date (for example, see Refs. 11Pagano M. Tam S.Y. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 12Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T.

Cell. 2001; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Proteasomes are ubiquitous, multicatalytic complexes responsible for non-lysosomal, ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic activity (14Matthews W. Driscoll J. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2597-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). They are highly conserved polysubunit complexes organized into a 20 S catalytic core or a 26 S complex containing the catalytic core plus an associated regulatory complex (15Bochtler M. Ditzel L. Groll M. Hartmann C. Huber R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 295-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Both 20 S and 26 S proteasome particles exhibit at least five different proteolytic activities (16Orlowski M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10289-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 17Orlowski M. Cardozo C. Michaud C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1563-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The proteasome plays important roles in cell cycle regulation and differentiation; thus, the degradation of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (p21 and p27) as well as transcription factors (NF-κB and IκB) and tumor suppressors (p53) occur via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (18Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar). During the differentiation of hematopoietic cells, changes in subcellular distribution, subunit composition, and enzymatic activity of proteasomes have been reported (19Frisan T. Levitsky V. Masucci M.G. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Henry L. Baz A. Chateau M.T. Scherrer K. Bureau J.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18100-18109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In malignant hematopoietic cells and breast cancer cells, concentrations of proteasomes have been reported to be abnormally high and localized in the nucleus of leukemia cells (23Kumatori A. Tanaka K. Inamura N. Sone S. Ogura T. Matsumoto T. Tachikawa T. Shin S. Ichihara A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7071-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Thus, proteasome regulation is fundamental to the maintenance of normal cellular processes. Indeed, proteasome inhibitors activate apoptosis in human HL60 leukemia cells (24Drexler H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and proteasome inhibitors have recently shown antitumor activity, with the potent boronic acid proteasome inhibitor PS-341 currently undergoing a clinical trial (25Teicher B.A. Gulshan A. Herbst R. Palombella V.J. Adams J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2638-2645PubMed Google Scholar, 26Adams J. Palombella V.J. Sausville E.A. Johnson J. Destree A. Lazarus D.D. Mass J. Pien C. Prakash S. Elliott P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2615-2622PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Gianni et al. (27Gianni M. Kalac Y. Ponzanelli I. Rambaldi A. Terao M. Garattini E. Blood. 2001; 97: 3234-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have shown that the c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 enhances retinoid-induced differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) NB4 cells, and that regulation of the proteasome plays a role in this process. In addition to the known enzymes affected by lithium, we demonstrate in this report that both the 20 S and 26 S forms of mammalian proteasomes are targets of lithium inhibition. Because the proteasome enzyme is intricately involved in the maintenance of many cellular processes, lithium chloride provides a unique method of regulation. An example of the significance of this action is seen in the differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ leukemia cells, where LiCl prevents the degradation of RARα protein pools produced by ATRA that are critical to promoting retinoid-induced leukemia cell differentiation (8Finch R.A. Li J. Chou T.C. Sartorelli A.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the structure and function of RARα are critical to the success of ATRA in the therapy of APL, which is often characterized by only short term remission rates and the development of retinoid resistance (28Lin R.J. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 179-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the prevention of receptor loss by LiCl may allow more complete cell differentiation and longer remissions in APL patients. WEHI-3B D+cells were cultured in suspension in McCoy's 5A-modified medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. Differentiation was induced with ATRA and LiCl at a cell density of 5 × 104cells/ml. The degree of differentiation was assessed 72 h post-induction and was measured by the capacity of cells to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium following TPA stimulation as described previously (8Finch R.A. Li J. Chou T.C. Sartorelli A.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were incubated with β-clastolactacystin (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) or benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Phe to induce differentiation. RARα was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of cell lysates prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer with 2 μg of anti-RARα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 12 h followed by incubation with Protein A/G Plus-agarose beads for 2 h. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with phosphate buffered saline and then separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. Ubiquitin-containing proteins were identified by Western blot analysis using mouse anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK, Ltd., Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). RARα and ubiquitinated RARα species were quantified by densitometric scanning of blots and analysis using ImageQuant software. Proteasomes were partially purified from 2 × 108 WEHI-3B D+ cells by homogenization in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.25m sucrose, pH 7.4, in a Dounce homogenizer followed by vortexing with glass beads (29Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Spies T. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet corresponding to the 26 S proteasome was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 20% glycerol. The supernatant was further centrifuged for 5 h at 100,000 × g, and the pellet (20 S proteasome) was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 20% glycerol. The proteolytic activity of WEHI-3B D+ 20 S and 26 S proteasomes was determined by the measurement of fluorescence generated from chymotryptic cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Leu-AMC (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA). Proteasomes (35 ng/μl) were incubated at 37 °C with 2.5–25 μmsubstrate in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mmEDTA buffer in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. Release of fluorescent AMC was measured using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax GeminiXS spectrafluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Inhibitors were added to the enzyme before the addition of substrate. Fluorescence release was measured for 60 min at 1-min intervals. Purified rabbit 20 S proteasome (CalBiochem, La Jolla, CA) activity was measured at 1.2 ng/μl as a positive control. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined from plots of the ratio of velocities with and without inhibitor at 0–10 min versus inhibitor concentration. Measurement of proteasomal tryptic-like activity was measured as above using the substrate Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC at 100 μm. [35S]Methionine-labeled RARα protein was generated by in vitro coupled transcription/translation from pGem3zf(+)RARα plasmid containing the cDNA of the mouse RARα gene using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of 0.4 mm [35S]methionine (20 μCi) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After completion, the reaction was treated with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 10 min at room temperature followed by the addition of dithiothreitol at a final concentration of 6 mm. The processing of labeled protein was modified from the degradation procedure described by Lodaet al. (30Loda M. Cukor B. Tam S.Y. Lavin P. Fiorentino M. Draetta G.F. Jessup J.M. Pagano M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). RARα-labeling reaction (4.5 μl) was incubated at 37 °C in degradation buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphokinase, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 5 μmubiquitin) for 30 min in the presence or absence of additional 26 S proteasomes (5 μg) partially purified from WEHI-3B D+cells. Degradation reactions were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by phosphorimaging analysis of radiolabeled RARα bands. In APL cell lines, both PML/RARα and RARα proteins were shown to be down-regulated by ATRA in a proteasome-dependent manner (9Zhu J. Gianni M. Kopf E. Honore N. Chelbi-Alix M. Koken M. Quignon F. Rochette-Egly C. de The H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14807-14812Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and in MCF7 breast cancer cells, ATRA similarly induced proteasome-dependent degradation of the receptor (10Tanaka T. Rodriguez de la Concepcon M.L. De Luca L.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored the mechanism by which LiCl maintained steady-state levels of RARα protein by measuring the patterns of ubiquitination of RARα after treatment with LiCl and ATRA, both alone and in combination in WEHI-3B D+cells. Polyubiquitinated RARα species were identified as multiple bands migrating at high molecular masses (Fig.1 A) with the exception of ubiquitinated proteins (between 97 and 66 kDa), which migrated similarly to nonspecific proteins that were detected by RARα antibody. The treatment of cells with 3 μm ATRA for 1 h caused a transient 4-fold increase in polyubiquitinated RARα species. Polyubiquitination decreased by 3 h and returned to control levels at 24 h (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, LiCl at 5 mm increased the level of polyubiquitinated RARα steadily over a 24-h period resulting in a 5.5-fold increase in polyubiquitinated RARα over untreated cell RARα polyubiquitination. This accumulation was even more pronounced when ATRA was combined with LiCl (Fig. 1 C). Accumulated polyubiquitinated bands were similar to the amounts present in the cells treated with the potent proteasome inhibitor β-clastolactacystin (Fig. 1 C). The accumulation of polyubiquitinated RARα proteins upon ATRA treatment confirms that the retinoid induces receptor ubiquitination, targeting RARα for proteasomal degradation. LiCl alone maintained increased levels of highly ubiquitinated receptors and, in combination with ATRA, blocked the degradation of ubiquitinated receptors in a manner analogous to that produced by the proteasome inhibitor β-clastolactacystin. The accumulation of polyubiquitinated RARα species produced by treatment with LiCl alone suggested that proteasome-dependent degradation of these receptors was relatively inactive in WEHI-3B D+ cells. To gain information on proteasomal activity in these cells, 20 S and 26 S proteasomes were partially purified from WEHI-3B D+ cells, and chymotryptic-like activity was assessed. Cleavage of the peptide substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Leu-AMC by the 20 S proteasome in the presence of 0.035% SDS resulted in fluorescence at 460 nm. 20 S proteasomes from WEHI-3B D+ cells displayed activity similar to that of commercially available rabbit 20 S proteasomes (>95% purity) (Fig. 2 A). The presence of increasing concentrations of LiCl decreased the rate of chymotryptic activity of WEHI-3B D+ and rabbit 20 S proteasomes (Fig. 2, B and C). LiCl at 2.5 mm significantly reduced peptide cleavage after 1 h by WEHI-3B D+ 20 S proteasomes, whereas 10 mm LiCl reduced fluorescence in this system to background levels. A plot ofV i /VO versus the concentration of LiCl from 0–10 min demonstrated an IC50for WEHI-3B D+ 20 S proteasomes of 4 mm (Fig.2 D). Furthermore, proteasome complexes partially purified from cells pretreated with 5 mm LiCl exhibited decreased activity in the absence of additional LiCl in the in vitroassay (Fig. 2 E). LiCl inhibited WEHI-3B D+ 26 S proteasomes to a similar extent (TableI), lowering theVmax/sec by more than 50% at 2.5 mm.Table IEffects of LiCl on the activity of WEHI-3B D + 26 S proteasomes in vitro26 S proteasomeLiCl0 mm2.5 mm5.0 mm10.0 mmV max /secActivity0.33930.14830.04000.0007S.D.1-aS.D. = standard deviation; n = 3.0.0150.0240.0270.0011-a S.D. = standard deviation; n = 3. Open table in a new tab To determine the specificity of proteasome inhibition by LiCl, the activity was measured in the presence of 1–10 mm NaCl, KCl, or 3–10 μm ATRA. No effect was observed on 20 S proteasome activity by the presence of 1–5 mm NaCl (Fig.3 A); however, 10 mm NaCl decreased activity slightly. In contrast, neither KCl nor ATRA significantly affected the rate of chymotryptic-like activity of 20 S proteasomes (Fig. 3, B and C). These observations suggest that LiCl has a unique effect on both WEHI-3B D+ and rabbit proteasome activity, and that this inhibitory effect probably is responsible for the observed accumulation of polyubiquitinated RARα species following exposure of WEHI-3B D+ cells to LiCl. LiCl at concentrations as high as 10 mm had no significant effect on the tryptic-like activity of partially purified 26 S proteasomes from WEHI-3B D+ cells (Fig.4). Thus, LiCl exhibited specificity for inhibition of chymotryptic-like protease activity. The combination of ATRA and LiCl acts synergistically to promote the terminal differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ cells (8Finch R.A. Li J. Chou T.C. Sartorelli A.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because LiCl inhibits proteasome activity, we postulate that at least a portion of the mechanism by which LiCl enhances the differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ cells produced by ATRA is attributed to the inhibition of proteasomal-targeted degradation of RARα. This action results in the restoration of RARα protein pools depleted by the retinoid. To assess whether RARα is a direct substrate for degradation by the proteasome, we measured the proteolytic cleavage of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled RARα protein by 26 S proteasomes partially purified from WEHI-3B D+ cells. The addition of 26 S proteasomes to [35S]methionine-labeled RARα proteins translated by rabbit reticulocyte lysate caused a marked decrease in radiolabel associated with RARα protein (Fig.5). Only 7.5% of RARα protein remained after exposure to proteasomes. However, in the presence of 5 mm LiCl, degradation by 26 S proteasomes was dramatically reduced, maintaining 80% of control levels of radiolabeled receptor protein. This observation illustrates that RARα proteins are direct substrates of the proteasome, and that LiCl prevents proteolytic degradation in a manner independent of other cellular components. To determine whether inhibition of proteasome activity by LiCl in intact cells is involved in the mechanism by which LiCl promotes the differentiation of WEHI-3B D+ cells by ATRA, the dependence of retinoid-induced differentiation on proteasome function was assessed. The extent of terminal differentiation was measured by determining the percentage of nitro blue tetrazolium-positive cells after 3 days of treatment of WEHI-3B D+ cells with either β-clastolactacystin, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, or the peptide aldehyde inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Phe. Proteasome inhibitors had no significant effect on differentiation when used alone. However, in combination with ATRA, β-clastolactacystin at 1 μm and 5 μm increased the degree of differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner from 27.7 ± 7.5% for the retinoid alone to 46.3 ± 4.9% and 65.0 ± 4.0%, respectively (Table II). A combination of LiCl with ATRA induced 74 ± 6% cell differentiation, a 2.7-fold increase over differentiation induced by ATRA alone, and benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Phe at 1 μm also exhibited synergism in combination with ATRA, inducing 62.0 ± 1.5% terminal differentiation.Table IIPercent cell differentiation of WEHI-3B D + cells in response to proteasome inhibitors, ATRA and LiClDifferentiation agent% NBT Positivityβ-ClastolactacystinBenzyloxycarbonyl-LLF2-aBenzyloxycarbonyl-LLF, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Phe.0 μm1 μm5 μm1 μmControl4.8 ± 2.95.0 ± 1.7nd2-bLiCl was used at 5 mm, and ATRA was used at 3 μm. nd, not determined.3.0 ± 0.7LiCl2-bLiCl was used at 5 mm, and ATRA was used at 3 μm. nd, not determined.14.3 ± 7.029.7 ± 2.3nd2-bLiCl was used at 5 mm, and ATRA was used at 3 μm. nd, not determined.44.0 ± 12.7ATRA2-bLiCl was used at 5 mm, and ATRA was used at 3 μm. nd, not determined.27.7 ± 7.546.3 ± 4.965.0 ± 4.062.0 ± 1.5Average values ± S.D. from three experiments are shown.2-a Benzyloxycarbonyl-LLF, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Phe.2-b LiCl was used at 5 mm, and ATRA was used at 3 μm. nd, not determined. Open table in a new tab Average values ± S.D. from three experiments are shown. In the present investigation, we report a new site of action of lithium, demonstrating that LiCl specifically inhibits the chymotryptic-like activity of both the 20 S and 26 S proteasome. An analysis of the rate of ubiquitination of RARα in the WEHI-3B D+ leukemia cell system demonstrated transient increases in polyubiquitination of RARα induced by ATRA in WEHI-3B D+cells, which was increased by the addition of LiCl. In addition to preventing the loss of ubiquitinated RARα species, LiCl alone was able to markedly reduce the enzymatic activity of the proteasome from WEHI-3B D+ cells. These results suggest that LiCl does not act to enhance ubiquitination but produces an accumulation of ubiquitinated RARα proteins by blocking ubiquitin-dependent degradation. We have also shown that other salts do not affect proteasome activity in a manner analogous to LiCl, suggesting a relatively unique effect on the proteasome by lithium (Fig. 3). Although we have observed a pronounced effect of LiCl on the isolated proteasome enzyme, we have also shown a reduction in the activity of proteasomes from cells pretreated with LiCl before purification (Fig.2). This finding suggests that LiCl may affect the proteasome structure irreversibly. It remains unclear how LiCl affects the proteasome; however, it is possible that LiCl causes spot-denaturation or small conformational changes at the chymotryptic-like active site. Alternatively, LiCl may induce the release of one or more of the subunits of this multisubunit complex. We have demonstrated that the effect of LiCl on proteasome enzymatic activity is related to its ability to potentiate retinoid-induced cell differentiation. Since activity of proteasomes toward the RARα protein substrate in a system separate from cell-signaling mechanisms was inhibited by LiCl (Fig. 5), we conclude that the effects of LiCl on proteasome activity directly relates to the regulation of the retinoid receptor shown to be key to ligand-induced terminal differentiation. Evidence to suggest that LiCl affects the proteasome in situis seen when peptide inhibitors of the proteasome were used in combination with ATRA to differentiate WEHI-3B D+ cells. Because the increase in differentiation obtained was similar to that observed with LiCl + ATRA, we conclude that the modulation of ATRA-induced differentiation by LiCl occurs, at least in part, through the inhibition of the proteasome. Interestingly, the degree of differentiation produced by the peptide inhibitors of the proteasome in combination with ATRA was slightly less than that achieved by the LiCl/ATRA combination. The use of proteasome inhibitors as antitumor agents is currently being evaluated as an approach to the therapy of cancer (25Teicher B.A. Gulshan A. Herbst R. Palombella V.J. Adams J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2638-2645PubMed Google Scholar, 26Adams J. Palombella V.J. Sausville E.A. Johnson J. Destree A. Lazarus D.D. Mass J. Pien C. Prakash S. Elliott P.J.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that lithium at therapeutic doses may have use in the treatment of malignant diseases other than APL. The ubiquitin-dependent proteasome has been reported to localize more prominently in the nucleus of leukemia cells as well as be expressed at much higher levels in these neoplastic cells than in normal cells (23Kumatori A. Tanaka K. Inamura N. Sone S. Ogura T. Matsumoto T. Tachikawa T. Shin S. Ichihara A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7071-7075Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, proteasome location and function may be implicated in maintaining the proliferative state, and regulation of the proteasome may play a key role in cancer cell growth. Furthermore, one can speculate that in cancerous cells that are not ATRA-responsive but have supra-normal levels of proteasome activity, the inhibition of the proteasome by LiCl may reduce cellular proteasome activity levels to those normally found in non-malignant cell types and thereby decrease proliferative activity. In WEHI-3B D+ leukemia cells, the disruption of the ATRA-induced targeting of RARα to the proteasome by LiCl appears to be important for promoting optimal terminal differentiation. Thus, upon treatment of WEHI-3B D+ cells with the combination of ATRA and LiCl, the accumulation of polyubiquitinated adducts appears to signal the cell to rebuild the pool of RARα protein, and RARα mRNA accumulation occurs (8Finch R.A. Li J. Chou T.C. Sartorelli A.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rebuilding of the RARα protein pool may be attributed to an increase in the back reaction of the ubiquitination enzyme system (i.e. ubiquitin hydrolysis), an increase in the rate of mRNA translation, or a combination of both events. The effects of LiCl on proteasome activity are likely not to be specific to leukemia cells and, therefore, may be beneficial in the differentiation therapy in combination with ATRA of a broad spectrum of cancers. The identification of this new cellular target of lithium may also help answer questions on the mechanism of lithium action implicated in non-cancer-related cellular processes.

Conceivably, understanding the mode of this unique phosphoinositide recognition will shed light on the mechanism by which PI3K regulates downstream signaling pathways. Although recent investigations demonstrate that distinct PH domains have evolved selectivity for different phosphoinositides to provide discriminatory regulation (5Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that PIP3binds selectively to the p85 C-terminal (CT-)SH2 domain of PI3K, thereby blocking the binding of p85 to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (3Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This model, however, was refuted by a recent NMR study that showed lack of specific binding of PIP3 to p85 SH2 domains (13Surdo P.L. Bottomley M.J. Arcaro A. Siegal G. Panayotou G. Sankar A.

Nevertheless, this question remains outstanding, because different structural analogues of PIP3 were used as binding ligands in these investigations, i.e. optically active diC16-PIP3 (3Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) versus a diastereomeric mixture of diC6-PIP3 (13Surdo P.L. Bottomley M.J. Arcaro A. Siegal G.

Thus, this study is aimed at clarifying these conflicting observations, of which the biochemical impetus is multifold. First, binding specificity of protein modular domains for distinct phosphoinositides is central to the mechanism by which the specificity of PI3K signaling is maintained. Second, SH2 domains play a crucial role in phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-dependent protein recruitment for the assembly of initial signaling complexes (14Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar, 15Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The displacement of pTyr by PIP3 in the SH2 domain binding may lead to a redistribution of PI3K in the plasma membrane, thereby providing a feedback mechanism for PI3K regulation. Moreover, in view of the pivotal role of PI3K lipid products in cell proliferation and survival, identification of their downstream effectors may help identify new therapeutic targets. Using three independent assays, we demonstrated that the p85α CT-SH2 domain displayed clear binding specificity and affinity for PIP3 (all phosphoinositides examined in this investigation were diC16 derivatives in optically active form unless otherwise mentioned), whereas the N-terminal (NT-)SH2 domain lacked significant binding to PIP3. Our data also indicate that reduction in the acyl chain of PIP3 led to a precipitous decrease in the binding affinity with the CT-SH2 domain, providing a plausible explanation for the discrepancy in previous data. Moreover, in light of the largely shared structural motifs between PIP3 and PI(4,5)P2, we hypothesized that the PIP3-recognition motif in the CT-SH2 domain encompassed a sequence that bound PI(4,5)P2. Based on a consensus sequence for PI(4,5)P2 binding (K XXXXXK XKK) reported by Yin and co-workers (16Yu F.X. Sun H.Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we proposed an internal peptide fragment,18RNKAENLLRGKR29, as the putative PIP3-binding site. This binding motif was verified by two independent approaches. First, a synthetic peptide containing this sequence exhibited distinctive binding specificity and affinity for PIP3. In addition, it was able to inhibit PIP3binding to the full-length protein in a dose-dependent manner and acquired an ordered conformation upon PIP3binding. Second, substitution of any of the five basic residues with Ala within the PIP3-binding site substantially diminished the binding affinity of the CT-SH2 domain to PIP3. More importantly, mutations at the flanking Arg residues (Arg18and Arg29) resulted in a switch in ligand specificity of the CT-SH2 domain to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2, respectively. In conjunction with these mutagenesis data, computer modeling suggests a pseudosymmetrical relationship in the interaction between the phosphoinositol head group and the binding motif. Together, these results confirm the previous observation that the p85α CT-SH2 domain binds to PIP3 with distinct specificity.

All synthetic phosphoinositides were characterized by 1H and31P NMR and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. No appreciable impurity was noted within the detection limits. The peptide used in this study was synthesized by an Applied Biosystem peptide synthesizer in the Macromolecular Structure Analysis Facility and was characterized by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry in the Mass Spectrometry Facility at University of Kentucky. The pGEX vector containing the cDNA sequence encoding the p85 NT-SH2 domain or the p85 CT-SH2 domain was expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (3Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The bacterial lysates were incubated with glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma Chemical Co.) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times with 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by the same buffer without Nonidet P-40 twice. The fusion protein immobilized onto glutathione beads was used directly for the [32P]phosphoinositide binding assay. However, free SH2 domains were employed in the subsequent fluorescence titration and gel filtration analyses. For the preparation of free SH2 domains, the immobilized protein was subjected to Factor Xa hydrolysis at 4 °C overnight, followed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. The supernatant that contained the free SH2 domain was recovered, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The homogeneity of isolated SH2 domains was indicated by a single band on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with molecular masses of 14 and 20 kDa for NT-SH2 and CT-SH2 domains, respectively. Individual point mutation were introduced into the plasmid pGEX/CT-SH2 encoding the wild type protein by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and each of the following mutagenesis primers: R18A, 5′-GGGGAGCAGCAACGCAAACAAAGCCG-3′; K20A, 5′-GCAACAACCGAAACGCAGCCGAGAACC-3′; R26A, 5′-GCCGAGAACCTATTGGCAGGGAAACGAGAT-3′; K28A, 5′-CCTATTGCGAGGGGCACGAGATGGC-5′; and R29A, 5′-GCGAGGGAAAGCAGATGGCACTTTCC-5′. The desired point mutation and sequence flanking the mutagenic primer-annealing site was confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. A mixture of [32P]PI(3)P, [32P]PI(3,4)P2, and [32P]PIP3 was prepared by incubating the type 1 brain extract (Sigma) with purified PI3K in the presence of excess phosphatidylserine as previously described (19Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture (100 μl) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and stopped by adding 5 μl of 1 m EDTA and 25 μl of 5 m HCl, followed by 160 μl of CHCl3-CH3OH (1:1; v/v). After mixing by vortex for 30 s, the phases were separated by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min. The organic layer was dried by a stream of nitrogen. The dried lipids were resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, and sonicated in a water bath-type sonicator for 5 min. The lipid micelles (10 μl) were added to 40 μl of Sepharose beads containing ∼12 μg of the GST fusion protein in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The incubation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature, and the beads were quickly washed twice with 1 ml of the same buffer. Lipids that were associated with the Sepharose beads were extracted with CHCl3-CH3OH (1:1; v/v), dried, and spotted onto 1% oxalic acid-treated TLC plates. The plates were developed with n-propanol:2 m acetic acid (65:35) for overnight. After drying, spots were located by autoradiography and compared with standards. The autoradiograms were scanned by a Fotodyne image system and quantified using the IMAGE program from the National Institutes of Health (version 1.59). Homogeneous phosphoinositide micelles were prepared according to a published procedure (20Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M. Baldassare J.J. Pollard T.D.

In brief, pure phosphoinositides were suspended in buffered solution and sonicated in a bath-type sonicator for 5 min at room temperature. The analysis was based on the principle that binding of a protein (or peptide) to PIP3-containing micelles will change its elution profile on gel filtration chromatography. Protein binding to micellar phosphoinositides was indicated by the co-elution of the protein at the void volume with the lipid vesicles, while free protein was retained. The SH2 full-length protein (or the peptide fragment) was incubated with lipid vesicles consisting of varying amounts of pure PIP3, in a final volume of 100 μl, for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 column (1 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 75 mm KCl. For the full-length protein, 1 mm dithiothreitol was included in the elution buffer. The column was eluted with the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min, and fractions of 0.45 ml were collected. Protein concentrations were analyzed by the Bradford assay. The lipid vesicle-bound peptide/protein was eluted in the void volume and was well separated from the free peptide/protein. The amount of micelle-bound peptide/protein was calculated as the difference between the total amount applied to the column and the amount of the free peptide/protein. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was estimated according to Equation 1 as follows.

The buffer used for the fluorescence experiment consisted of 25 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Varying amounts of PIP3, in 15 μl of the same buffer, were gradually introduced into 785 μl of the buffer containing NT-SH2 domain (12 μm) or CT-SH2 domain (12.5 μm). CD spectra were recorded with a JASCO J720 spectropolarimeter at room temperature in a 10-mm path length cell. The solution contained 40 μm of the CT-SH2 peptide fragment in the presence of six molar equivalents of PIP3. The following settings were used: wavelength range, 200–250 nm; bandwidth, 1 nm; step resolution, 0.5 nm; scan speed, 10 millidegrees/min. Each spectrum represented an average of ten scans with baseline subtraction. To demonstrate the phosphoinositide binding specificity of p85α SH2 domains, we used three independent analyses, i.e. radioligand binding, fluorescence titration, and gel filtration. In the radioligand experiment, phosphoinositide vesicles containing equal amounts of [32P]PIP3, [32P]PI(3,4)P2, and [32P]PI(3)P were exposed to the respective GST fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione-coated beads. It has been shown that GST did not interfere with PIP3 binding (3Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). After incubation, the immobilized protein was separated from the incubation mixture by centrifugation. SH-2 domain-bound phosphoinositides were extracted and analyzed by TLC then by autoradiography (Fig. 1). This competitive radioligand binding experiment shows that both NT- and CT-SH2 domains exhibited preferential binding to PIP3. However, the PIP3-binding affinity of the NT-SH2 domain was substantially lower than that of the CT-SH2 counterpart, by nearly two orders of magnitude. To confirm this observation, we further used fluorescence titration and gel filtration to examine the differential recognition of phosphoinositides by these SH2 domains. Both methods, especially gel filtration, have been applied to the analysis of phosphoinositide binding in a number of proteins including profilin (20Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Machesky L.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12181-12189Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To eliminate potential interference by the GST moiety in these analyses, we isolated the free SH2 domain by subjecting the respective immobilized fusion protein to Factor Xa hydrolysis, followed by centrifugation. Fig. 2 A shows the quenching effect of PIP3 on the tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence of the CT-SH2 domain, which, upon excitation at 292 nm, displayed an emission maximum at 330 nm. Micellar PIP3attenuated the Trp fluorescence in a dose-dependent and saturable manner, whereas PIP3 alone did not show appreciable emission (data not shown). Accordingly, the Kd was estimated to be 23 ± 3 μm(n = 3) (Fig. 2 B). Other phosphoinositides examined showed significantly lower binding affinity, with Kd values ranging from 4- to 20-fold higher than that of PIP3. These results were consistent with the above competitive binding data. In contrast, when the NT-SH2 domain was analyzed, its Trp fluorescence was very little perturbed by PIP3 (not shown). The fluorescence quenching could not be saturated even with 60 molar excess of PIP3, confirming its low binding affinity with the NT-SH2 domain. With regard to the gel filtration analysis (not shown), apparent Kd values for the CT-SH2 domain binding were estimated to be 34 ± 6 μm for PIP3(n = 5), 110 ± 25 μm for PI(4,5)P2 (n = 3), and ∼300 μm for PI(3,4)P2. Again, with the NT-SH2 domain, no significant protein adsorption was noted with lipid vesicles consisting of PIP3 or any other phosphoinositide examined. To examine whether the diacylglycerol moiety played a role in the interaction of PIP3 with the CT-SH2 domain, we analyzed the binding of the CT-SH2 domain to the diC8 and diC4 derivatives of PIP3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, the head group of PIP3, by fluorescence titration. An inverse relationship was noted between the acyl chain length and the Kdvalue, i.e. diC16-PIP3, 23 ± 3 μm (n = 3); diC8-PIP3, 93 ± 5 μm(n = 3); diC4-PIP3, > 500 μm. With regard to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, no significant binding to the CT-SH2 domain was noted. These data indicate the involvement of the acyl chain of PIP3 in the interaction with the CT-SH2 domain. Previously, we reported that PIP3 could be recognized by a synthetic peptide in a selective manner (27Lu P.J. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 466-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that PIP3 binding might be achieved by a contiguous peptide fragment. Because PIP3 contains all the structural features of PI(4,5)P2 with an additional 3-phosphoryl function on the inositol ring, we hypothesized that the recognition motif for PIP3 encompassed the PI(4,5)P2-binding sequence with additional basic residue(s) flanking either the N or C terminus for interacting with the 3-phosphate. Previously, Yin and co-workers (16Yu F.X. Sun H.Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) delineated a consensus sequence for PI(4,5)P2 binding, i.e.K XXXXXK XKK (K denotes Lys, Arg, and His), by analyzing a series of PI(4,5)P2-binding proteins (16Yu F.X. Sun H.Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By examining the amino acid sequence of the CT-SH2 domain (Fig.3), we proposed the internal sequence RNKAENLLRGKR, corresponding to amino acids 18–29 on the helix αA, as the putative PIP3-binding motif. This binding motif was verified by two independent approaches, i.e. a synthetic peptide and site-directed mutagenesis. To examine whether the proposed sequence could interact with PIP3, we synthesized the peptide corresponding to amino acids 11–29 (WNVGSSNRNKAENLLRGKR) of the CT-SH2 domain. Interactions of this synthetic CT-SH2 peptide with various phosphoinositides were assessed by gel filtration. It is noteworthy that the CT-SH2 peptide displayed a high degree of selectivity in phosphoinositide recognition. It bound PIP3with Kd of 30 ± 7 μm(n = 3), which was in line with that of the full-length CT-SH2 protein. More importantly, the binding affinity of other phosphoinositides examined was one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of PIP3. The Kd values were: PI(4,5)P2 (350 ± 30 μm, n = 3), PI(3,4)P2 (>500 μm), PI(3)P (>1 mm), and PI(4)P (>1 mm). Phospholipids lacking the phosphoinositol head group, such as PI, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine, showed no appreciable binding to the peptide. This differential recognition strongly argues against the possibility that the binding arose from nonspecific charge-charge interactions. This specific PIP3-peptide interaction was further supported by two lines of evidence. First, this peptide fragment inhibited the binding of PIP3to the full-length CT-SH2 domain in a dose-dependent manner. To facilitate the radioligand binding assay, the CT-SH2 domain was biotinylated with p-diazobenzoyl biocytin, which allowed the protein to be immobilized onto streptavidin-coated beads. As shown, the CT-SH2 peptide fragment blocked the binding of [3H]diC8-PIP3 to the immobilized CT-SH2 domain in a competitive manner. The IC50 was estimated to be 62 μm (Fig.4 A). The concentration range for the complete inhibition lied within one log unit, indicating that the binding of PIP3 to the peptide was specific. Second, the CT-SH2 peptide acquired a partially ordered structure by moving from an unbound form to a PIP3-bound state. Fig.4 B shows the circular dichroism spectra of the peptide alone (trace a) and in the presence of 6 molar equivalents of diC8-PIP3 (trace b) in the far UV range between 200 and 250 nm. The spectra underwent marked changes when PIP3 was added, in which absorption around 222 nm was indicative of α-helical structures. Comparing the putative PIP3-binding motif (18RNKAENLLRGKR29) with the consensus sequence for PIP2 binding (K XXXXXK XKK) we hypothesized that Arg18 was involved in direct interactions with the 3-phosphoryl group of the inositol ring. Accordingly, neutral substitution of Arg18 would result in a sequence conforming to the consensus sequence for PI(4,5)P2 binding. This modification might change the ligand specificity of the resulting CT-SH2 domain from PIP3 to PI(4,5)P2. To address this issue, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to replace each of the five basic residues within the region (Arg18, Lys20, Arg26, Lys28, and Arg29) with alanine. By designing mutagenic primers to induce single base pair changes in the cDNA sequence for the p85 CT-SH2 domain, we generated these five mutant clones to which we assigned the names R18A, K20A, R26A, K28A, and R29A according to the wild type amino acid altered, its position in the wild type sequence, and the amino acid substituted in its place. All of these mutants were successfully expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione beads. The fusion proteins were treated with Factor Xa to isolate the mutated CT-SH2 domains. Milligram quantities of these mutant proteins were obtained. Each of these proteins showed a single protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with molecular mass identical to that of the wild type protein (data not shown). The effect of these mutations on the interactions with phosphoinositides is summarized in Fig.5. In line with our hypothesis, R18A exhibited enhanced binding affinity with PI(4,5)P2 accompanied by a 16-fold decrease in PIP3 binding affinity vis à vis the wild type, resulting in a switch in ligand preference from PIP3to PI(4,5)P2. In contrast, the impact of this amino acid replacement on PI(3,4)P2 binding was limited,i.e. ∼20% increase in Kd. Neutral substitution of any of the other four basic residues with alanine also attenuated PIP3 binding, although to a lesser extent as compared with R18A. It is noteworthy that mutations at Arg26, Lys28, and Arg29 had a positive effect on PI(3,4)P2 binding (50% to 86% reduction in Kd values). Moreover, switch in ligand specificity from PIP3 to PI(3,4)P2 was noted in R29A, underscoring the importance of Arg29 in interacting with the 5-phosphoryl function on the inositol ring. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the change in phosphoinositide binding specificity by site-directed mutagenesis. To shed light on the mode of phosphoinositide recognition, we synthesized three permuted isomers of PIP3(PI(3,4,6)P3, PI(3,5,6)P3, and PI(4,5,6)P3), and examined their binding affinity with the CT-SH2 domain vis à vis PIP3 by fluorescence titration (Fig. 6). It is interesting to note that the CT-SH2 domain exhibited a high degree of tolerance with regard to the regioisomeric arrangement of the three phosphate functions. As shown, except PI(4,5,6)P3, they bound to the CT-SH2 domain with comparable affinity despite variation in the position of phosphoryl groups. This observation suggests that the charge density on the phosphoinositol ring represents a key factor in the binding, i.e. the effective binding is facilitated by three adjacent phosphoryl functions, regardless of their relative positions on the ring. Although the PI(4,5)P2-binding motif on various proteins has been extensively studied (e.g. α-actinin (28Fukami K. Sawada N. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 6: 385-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This study is aimed at resolving a controversial issue of whether p85α SH2 domains could interact with PIP3 in a selective manner. The present data demonstrate that the CT-SH2 domain, but not the NT-SH2 domain, displays specific binding to PIP3. Our data indicate that the acyl chain of PIP3 plays a crucial role in CT-SH2 domain binding. Decrease in the chain length precipitously attenuates the binding affinity with PIP3. The Kd values increase from 23 μm to over 500 μm when the acyl group is shortened from C16 to C4. This observation provides a plausible explanation for the lack of specific interaction between diC6-PIP3 and the CT-SH2 domain in the NMR analysis (13Surdo P.L. Bottomley M.J. Arcaro A. Siegal G. Panayotou G. Sankar A. Gaffney P.R. Riley A.M. Potter B.V. Waterfield M.D. Driscoll P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15678-15685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition to the short acyl chain, only 25% of the diastereomeric mixture of diC6-PIP3 represents the physiologically relevant isomer, of which the impact on the binding affinity with the SH2 domain remains unclear. In light of our hypothesis that the PIP3-binding motif contains a PI(4,5)P2-binding sequence (K XXXXXK XKK), we propose the internal peptide fragment 18RNKAENLLRGKR29 as the PIP3-binding site. This motif resides in the helix αA that is readily accessible to the milieu. Furthermore, it is located near the pTyr-binding motif FLVR. The close proximity between these two motifs is in line with the observation that PIP3 binding and tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide binding to the CT-SH2 domain were mutually exclusive (3Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This PIP3-binding site was confirmed by two independent approaches that employed a synthetic peptide and site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. The synthetic peptide displays discriminative binding affinity with PIP3 and competes with the full-length protein for PIP3 binding in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the Kdvalue of the synthetic peptide with PIP3 is consistent with that of the full-length CT-SH2 domain (30 versus 23 μm), indicating that this contiguous peptide fragment contributes to the PIP3 binding. The mutagenesis study indicates that neutral substitution of any of the five basic residues within the binding sequence resulted in a considerable decrease in the binding affinity with PIP3. It is especially noteworthy that modification of the flanking Arg18 and Arg29 leads to changes in the ligand specificity to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2, respectively. This observation underlines the importance of these two residues in interacting with the 3- and 5-phosphoryl functions on the inositol ring. Together, these data suggest a working hypothesis that depicts the mode of interaction between the binding site and the phosphoinositol head group of PIP3 (Fig.7 A). As shown, the electrostatic interactions between the basic residues and phosphate functions exhibit a high degree of symmetry surrounding the central Arg26. Disruption of this pseudosymmetrical relationship not only decreases the PIP3 binding affinity, but also alters the phosphoinositide specificity. To gain insight into this molecular interaction, we mapped the electrostatic potential onto the solvent accessible surface of the CT-SH2 domain (Fig.7 B). As shown, Lys20, Arg26, and Lys28 cluster to create a single basic patch on the surface of the CT-SH2 domain with direct interaction with the phosphoryl functions at positions 3, 4, and 5, respectively, on the phosphoinositol ring of PIP3. The docking experiment indicates a perfect fit of three-point attachment between these two components. Consequently, mutation at any of these three basic residues diminished the binding affinity. Furthermore, this computer modeling suggests that Arg18 and Arg29 play a crucial role in governing the ligand specificity by regulating the αA helical structure. These two Arg residues, located at the N- and C-terminal ends of αA, are distant from the basic triad, and the guanidino moieties are oriented away from the phosphoinositol head group. Because alanine has a strong helix propensity, it is assumed that substitution of either Arg residue with alanine might affect the helicity of αA. As a consequence, the mutation R18A disrupts the interaction of the nearby Lys20 with the 3-phosphate while maintaining the structural integrity of Arg26 and Lys28. This conformational modification results in a change in the ligand specificity to PI(4,5)P2. Likewise, the R29A mutation would impose a conformational effect limited to Lys28, resulting in a switch of the binding preference to PI(3,4)P2. Our binding data indicate that the regioisomeric arrangement of the phosphoryl functions does not have a significant impact on the binding to the CT-SH2 domain. Apparently, the charge density on the phosphoinositol ring represents a key factor in determining the phosphoinositide binding specificity of the CT-SH2 domain. This ligand specificity is achieved through the participation of all three phosphates on the inositol ring, regardless of their relative positions on the ring. It is noteworthy that the mode of PIP3 recognition by the CT-SH2 domain is distinctively different from that proposed for the Grp1 PH domain (36Lietzke S.E. Bose S. Cronin T. Klarlund J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 385-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The signature motif for phosphoinositide binding on the PH domain consists of three separate regions encompassed by the β1/β2 loop, the β3/β4 loop, and the β6/β7 insertion region, whereas the PIP3 binding on the CT-SH2 domain is regulated by a contiguous peptide fragment on the αA helix. This structural variation may underscore differences in the phosphoinositide binding specificity and affinity between these two protein modular domains. Moreover, sequence analysis indicates that the SH2 domains of a number of signaling proteins (37Schaffhausen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 61-75PubMed Google Scholar) contain internal sequences homologous to the CT-SH2 PIP3-recognition motif in similar locales relative to the FLVR sequence. The bold residues denote basic amino acids, and the underlined region represents the putative PIP3-binding motif. Among these proteins, the N-terminal (NT) SH2 domain of PLCγ1 has been shown to bind PIP3 (3Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 4Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Thus, this sequence may be of predictive value for the putative PIP3-binding site, which remains to be investigated. In summary, this study demonstrates the specific binding of the p85α CT-SH2 domain to PIP3 and identifies the phosphoinositide-binding site. Data from site-directed mutagenesis suggest that interactions between PIP3 and its recognition site display a high degree of symmetry. Disruption of this pseudosymmetrical relationship results in change in ligand preference to either PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4)P2. This switch in binding specificity suggests a mechanism whereby phosphoinositide-binding proteins have evolved distinct binding selectivity, which constitutes the focus of the present study.

In the absence of appropriate peptides, such as in cells lacking the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), the stability of the class I molecule is drastically reduced and its expression at the cell surface largely impaired (12Ljunggren H.G. Karre K. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1745-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 13Ljunggren H.G. Stam N.J. Ohlen C. Neefjes J.J. Hoglund P. Heemels M.T. Bastin J. Schumacher T.N. Townsend A.

Nature. 1990; 345: 449-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Because of its significant contribution to peptide stability (5Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 265: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), a free NH2 terminus is found in the overwhelming majority of natural class I-bound peptides. However, finding of an N α-acetylated natural ligand of HLA-B39 (16Yague J. Alvarez I. Rognan D. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a blocked NH2 terminus does not necessarily impair peptide binding in vivo. Nevertheless, this peptide bound less efficiently than a nonacetylated analog. Recently, the crystal structure of HLA-A*0201 in complex with a human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1-derived Tax8 peptide lacking the amino-terminal binding residue was reported (17Khan A.R. Baker B.M. Ghosh P. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6398-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that one such peptide may bind in vitro to class I molecules, albeit with reduced stability relative to its canonical counterpart. Binding was possible because the A pocket was filled with hydrogen-bonded water molecules that partially compensated for the loss of canonical interactions involving the NH2terminus of the P1 residue. In that study the Tax8 peptide had a negligible ability to sensitize target cells for lysis by one Tax9-specific CTL clone. However, in an earlier report (18Utz U. Koenig S. Coligan J.E. Biddison W.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 214-221PubMed Google Scholar), Tax8 sensitized targets for lysis by Tax-specific CTL generated from HTLV-1-infected individuals against this Tax peptide. That study did not rule out the possibility that this reflects cross-reactivity from some CTL stimulated in vivo against the dominant Tax9 epitope and, therefore, did not show that Tax8 was a natural ligand of HLA-A2. In this study, we report, for the first time to our knowledge, the identification of natural class I ligands lacking the amino-terminal binding residue, from endogenous peptide pools. These peptides were isolated from three HLA-B39 allotypes: B*3901, B*3905, and B*3909. These molecules bind peptides with either Arg2 or His2, but the preference of each allotype for either motif is variable; B*3905 has a higher preference for His2 than B*3901, whereas B*3909 has a marked preference for Arg2(19Falk K.

HMy2.C1R (C1R) is a human lymphoid cell line with low expression of its endogenous class I antigens (22Storkus W.J. Howell D.N. Salter R.D. Dawson J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1657-1659PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zemmour J. Little A.M. Schendel D.J. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1941-1948PubMed Google Scholar). C1R transfectants expressing B*3901, B*3905, or B*3909 have been described previously (20Yague J. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Marina A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A.

Med. 1985; 162: 1745-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). B*3901-RMA-S transfectant cells were kindly supplied by Dr. Masafumi Takiguchi (Division of Viral Immunology, Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan). B*3909-RMA-S has been described previously (20Yague J. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Marina A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1999; 53: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both RMA-S transfectants express human β2m. C1R cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4, containing 7.5% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G. RMA-S transfectant cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm Hepes buffer and 7.5% heat-inactivated FBS, without antibiotics but with 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin B for the B*3901 transfectant. Approximately 1010 HLA-B*3901-, B*3905-, or B*3909-C1R transfectant cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, containing the following protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 18.5 μg/ml iodoacetamide, 1 mm EDTA, 348 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.02% NaN3. Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 1,500 × g, and then for 1 h at 38,000 × g. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm Durapore membrane filter, pre-cleared with Sepharose-ethanolamine beads, and subjected to affinity chromatography with W6/32-Sepharose. The murine W6/32 mAb is an IgG2a, specific for a monomorphic HLA-A,B,C determinant (24Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). The column was washed with: (a) 250 ml of NET (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% NaN3, pH 7.4) containing 10% saturated NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, (b) 250 ml of NET containing 5% of saturated NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and (c) 500 ml of NET. Peptide elution was done with 0.1% TFA in water at room temperature. Collected fractions were filtered through Centricon C-3. Material with Mr <3000 Da was subjected to reverse phase HPLC on a Deltapak C18 column maintained at 30 °C, using a flow rate of 100 μl/min and the following linear gradient: 0–20 min, 100% A; 100 min, 56% A; 140 min, 100% B; 141 min, 100% acetonitrile; 145 min, 100% acetonitrile, 200 μl/min. Buffers A and B were 0.1% TFA in water and 80% acetonitrile (v/v), 0.1% TFA in water, respectively. Fractions (50 μl) were collected at 30-s intervals. Peptide composition analysis, zoomscan, and sequencing by electrospray ion trap MS was carried out with an LCQ instrument (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA), using the “nanospray” interface as detailed elsewhere (25Marina A. Garcia M.A. Albar J.P. Yague J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In some cases, sequence assignments were confirmed by refragmenting some fragment ions (MS3) arising from the parental one, and by MS/MS sequencing of the corresponding synthetic peptides. Zoomscan is a high resolution method for determining accurate peptide mass and charge of ionic species, in which a narrow precursor ion window is selected to incorporate several isotopomers. The charge states of individual product ions were determined at enhanced resolution by scanning across a limited mass/charge (m/z) range. In some experiments, the peptide composition of HPLC fractions was analyzed by matrix-assisted desorption-ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS using a calibrated Kompact Probe instrument (Kratos-Shimadzu, Manchester, United Kingdom) operating in the positive linear mode as described previously (26Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), using 1 μl of the HPLC fractions. The epitope stabilization assay used to measure peptide binding was performed as described (27Galocha B. Lamas J.R. Villadangos J.A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, B*3901-RMA-S or B*3909-RMA-S transfectants were incubated at 26 °C for 24 h. They were then incubated 1 h at 26 °C with 10−4 to 10−9m peptide without FBS, transferred to 37 °C, and collected for FMF after 3 h (B*3901) or 4 h (B*3909). B*3901 or B*3909 expression was measured using 50 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant containing the mAb W6/32, as described previously (20Yague J. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Marina A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1999; 53: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Binding was expressed as the C50, which is the molar concentration of a given peptide at 50% of the maximum fluorescence obtained with that peptide within the concentration range used. Approximately 2 × 105 B*3901-RMA-S transfectant cells/well were incubated at 26 °C for 18 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, washed twice with serum-free medium, and further incubated with 100 μm peptide and 100 nmhuman β2m for 1 h at 26 °C in the presence of 5 μg/ml brefeldin A, to avoid appearance of newly synthesized class I MHC molecules, in a total volume of 100 μl. Cells were then washed with RPMI 1640 medium, resuspended in brefeldin A-containing AIM V medium, and transferred to 37 °C. Cells were removed at various times and subjected to FMF with the W6/32 mAb as in the previous paragraph. Cell surface stability of the B*3901-peptide complexes was measured as DT50, which is the time corresponding to 50% of the maximum fluorescence, measured at time 0 after transfer to 37 °C. In a first assay, three synthetic peptides: EHAGVISVL (0.78 nmol), IHEPEPHIL (0.40 nmol), and NAc-SHVAVENAL (0.99 nmol) were dissolved in 400 μl of NET buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated for 90 min at room temperature in a NET-washed W6/32-Sepharose column, like those used for immunoaffinity purification of HLA-B39. Elution of the peptides was carried out with five column volumes of 0.1% TFA in water at 0.3 ml/min. The 15-ml eluate was concentrated to 5 ml, passed through Centricon C-3, and then through a Sep-Pak t-C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% TFA in water. The sample was loaded into the column and rinsed with 15 ml of 0.1% TFA. Peptides were eluted with 10 ml of 20% water in CH3CN, brought to a final volume of 100 μl of 0.1% aqueous TFA, and subjected to reverse phase HPLC in the same conditions used for HLA-B39-bound peptide pools. A separate blank for the W6/32-Sepharose and Sep-Pak t-C18 columns was run in parallel. In a second assay, 8.2 × 108 untransfected C1R cells were lysed and further processed exactly as done for isolation of HLA-B39-bound peptides. Immediately after washing the lysate supernatant from the W6/32-Sepharose immunoaffinity column, a mixture of three synthetic peptides, EHAGVISVL (0.39 nmol), IHEPEPHIL (0.17 nmol), and NAc-SHVAVENAL (0.41 nmol) dissolved in 400 μl of NET buffer, pH 7.4, was loaded into the column and eluted with 20 ml of 0.1% TFA in water at 0.3 ml/min at room temperature. Peptide-containing fractions were filtered through Centricon C-3 and subjected to reverse phase HPLC as in the previous assay. Composition of HPLC fractions eluting in the 70–90-min range was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The HLA-B*3905-bound peptide pool was isolated from B*3905-C1R transfectant cells after immunopurification of the class I molecule and acid extraction. Peptides were fractionated by HPLC (Fig.1). Full scan analysis of HPLC fraction N.158 (elution time: 78 min) by nanoelectrospray quadrupole ion trap MS revealed a prominent ion peak at m/z 486.1. Zoomscan analysis was consistent with the [M + 2H]2+ ion of a peptide with a molecular mass (M) of 970.4 Da (Fig.2 A). The MS/MS fragmentation spectrum of this ion peak was consistent with the sequence HEPEPHIL (Fig. 2 B). This was confirmed by MS/MS fragmentation of the corresponding synthetic peptide (data not shown). An NH2-terminally extended peptide, IHEPEPHIL, found in the same peptide pool (Fig. 1), had been previously reported as a natural B*3905 ligand (21Yague J. Ramos M. Ogueta S. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2000; 56: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, these results indicate that a peptide in the B*3905-bound pool lacks the P1 residue of another natural ligand from the same peptide pool.Figure 2Panel A, full scan MS spectrum of HPLC fraction N.158 from the B*3905-bound peptide pool. Zoomscan analysis (inset) of the major ion peak (m/z486.1) revealed that it corresponded to the [M+2H]2+ ion of a peptide with M = 970.4 Da. Panel B, MS/MS fragmentation spectrum of the ion peak at m/z 486.1 in Panel A; identified fragment ions of the b and y“ series, and prominent ion peaks corresponding to secondary series, are indicated. Ion peaks at m/z 235.1 and 574.1 were identified as internal sequence ions PH and PEPHI upon refragmentation (MS3) of the latter one (data not shown). The peptide sequence assigned is shown. It was confirmed by MS/MS fragmentation of the corresponding synthetic peptide. The nomenclature of Roepsstorff and Fohlman (35Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass. Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar) was used for the main and secondary series of fragment ions, and that of Biemann (36Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) for internal sequence ions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Three additional peptides related to previously described B*3905 ligands with His2 by lack of their P1 residue were found in the same peptide pool. In HPLC fractions N.155 (elution time: 76.5 min) and N.175 (elution time: 86.5 min), zoomscan analysis revealed the presence of peptides with molecular mass of 746.4 and 794.3, respectively (Fig. 3), whose sequence by nanoelectrospray MS/MS (Fig. 4) demonstrated that they were peptides with His1: HGPNPIL and HAGVISVL, respectively. The sequence of the latter peptide was confirmed by MS/MS fragmentation of the corresponding synthetic peptide. NH2-terminally extended counterparts of these peptides (EHGPNPIL and EHAGVISVL) were known natural B*3905 ligands (21Yague J. Ramos M. Ogueta S. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2000; 56: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A third peptide, with M = 851.3 was detected in HPLC fraction N.145 (elution time: 71.5 min) from B*3905. Although this peptide was not revealed initially by full scan or zoomscan analyses, its presence was confirmed by direct MS/MS fragmentation analysis focused at the corresponding m/z value, after its finding in B*3909 (Fig. 3). The sequence of this peptide, as determined by nanoelectrospray MS/MS (Fig. 4), was HVAVENAL. This peptide was the (−P1) counterpart of a previously reported N α-acetylated HLA-B39 ligand NAc-SHVAVENAL (16Yague J. Alvarez I. Rognan D. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Exp.

Nomenclature is as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Besides being B*3905 ligands, NAc-SHVAVENAL and EHAGVISVL were also isolated from B*3901 and B*3909 (16Yague J.

Thus, the presence of the corresponding (−P1) peptides was searched in the peptide pools from these subtypes, using the same approach as in B*3905. As summarized in Table I, HVAVENAL, HEPEPHIL, and HAGVISVL were found in the B*3901-bound peptide pool. The former and latter peptides were also detected in B*3909. The identity of these peptides was established by MS/MS sequencing in all cases (Fig. 4 and data not shown).Table IIdentification of natural ligands of B*3901, B*3905, and B*3909 lacking the amino-terminal binding residue(+P1)/(−P1)B*3901B*3905B*3909MFractionMFractionMFractionNAc-SHVAVENAL/HVAVENAL980.4 /851.2155 /145980.4 /851.2155 /145980.5 /851.3155 /145EHGPNPIL/HGPNPIL875.4 /746.4156 /155IHEPEPHIL/HEPEPHIL1083.6 /970.4166 /1581083.6 /970.4166 /158EHAGVISVL/HAGVISVL923.3 /794.2178 /176923.5 /794.3177 /175923.4 /794.3177 /175Peptides lacking an amino-terminal binding residue (−P1) and their NH2-terminally extended counterparts (+P1) are indicated.

The molecular mass (M) of each peptide, as determined by nanoelectrospray MS, and HPLC fraction number in which they eluted are indicated for each HLA-B39 allotype. Two control experiments were done to rule out the possibility that the (−P1) peptides found might result from residual exopeptidase activity during the isolation procedure, despite using protease inhibitors. The first experiment addressed the possibility of murine exopeptidase contamination in the W6/32-Sepharose immunoaffinity column used for purification of HLA-B39 from cell lysates. Known amounts of the synthetic NAc-SHVAVENAL, IHEPEPHIL, and EHAGVISVL peptides were incubated for 90 min into the column at pH 7.4, eluted with 0.1% aqueous TFA, and fractionated by HPLC in the same conditions used for fractionation of B39-bound peptide pools. (Fig.5 A). The three synthetic peptides were recovered with high yield. HPLC fractions around the retention times of the corresponding (−P1) peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, and showed no evidence for these peptides (not shown). This result indicates that the (−P1) peptides found in the B39-bound peptide pools do not result from contamination of the immunoaffinity column by murine exopeptidases. The second experiment addressed the possibility that residual exopeptidase activity in the cell lysate could have contaminated the immunoaffinity column. Untransfected C1R cells were lysed exactly like the B39 transfectants, in the presence of protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were loaded into, incubated, and washed out from the W6/32 immunoaffinity column at neutral pH, using the same procedure as for purification of HLA-B39. The synthetic NAc-SHVAVENAL, IHEPEPHIL, and EHAGVISVL peptides were then loaded into the lysate-treated column, incubated for 10 min at neutral pH, and eluted with 0.1% aqueous TFA at lower rate than that used for elution of B39-bound peptide pools, to increase any putative exopeptidase action at this stage, and fractionated by HPLC (Fig. 5 B). Again, the synthetic precursors were recovered with high yield, and no evidence for the presence of the corresponding (−P1) peptides could be detected by MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the corresponding HPLC fractions (Fig.6). This result indicates that the (−P1) peptides in the B39-bound peptide pool do not result from exopeptidase activity in the cell lysates. For simplicity, ∼10-fold fewer cells than for peptide isolation were used in this control experiment, but the whole process, including treatment of the lysate with protease inhibitors, was correspondingly scaled down. Because exopeptidases are highly active enzymes, it is very unlikely that the lower number of cells used may have impaired our ability to detect any significant peptidase activity in the cell lysate, particularly with the incubation conditions used. Two pairs of synthetic peptides, EHAGVISVL/HAGVISVL and NAc-SHVAVENAL/HVAVENAL, were tested for binding to B*3901 and B*3909 at the cell surface, using an epitope stabilization assay with RMA-S transfectant cells (Fig. 7). For B*3901, binding of HAGVISVL was very efficient (C50: 3 ± 0.2 μm) and similar or slightly better than binding of its NH2-terminally extended counterpart EHAGVISVL (6 ± 0.5 μm). Binding of NAc-SHVAVENAL and HVAVENAL to B*3901 was also very similar to each other (C50: 19 ± 2 and 16 ± 2 μm, respectively) and significantly lower than binding of the other peptide pair. Similar results were obtained for B*3909 (Fig. 7); binding of each (−P1) peptide was very similar to binding of its NH2-terminally extended counterpart, and binding of the EHAGVISVL/HAGVISVL pair (C50: 10 ± 2 and 9 ± 2 μm, respectively) was significantly better than binding of the NAc-SHVAVENAL/HVAVENAL pair (C50: 28 ± 2 and 33 ± 2 μm, respectively). The EHAGVISVL/HAGVISVL and NAc-SHVAVENAL/HVAVENAL peptide pairs were also tested for their capacity to stabilize HLA-B*3901 on the surface of brefeldin A-treated RMA-S transfectant cells (Fig.8). Again, similar or slightly higher stability of HAGVISVL (DT50: 3.5 ± 0.5 h) in complex with B*3901 was observed, relative to EHAGVISVL (DT50: 2.5 ± 0.1 h). The stability of NAc-SHVAVENAL (DT50: 1.5 ± 0.2 h) was moderate, and lower than for the previous peptide pair, but similar to that of HVAVENAL (DT50: 1.62 ± 0.04 h). These results indicate that, for two pairs of natural HLA-B39 ligands, lack of the P1 residue have little or no effect on cell surface binding and stability to HLA-B39 in vitro. This study demonstrated that peptides lacking the amino-terminal binding residue are found in HLA-B39-bound peptide pools together with their NH2-terminally extended canonical counterparts. Four examples were identified using an MS-based approach. The trivial explanation that (−P1) peptides might have resulted from exopeptidase activity during the isolation procedure was ruled out by the following findings. (a) Cells were lysed in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors, following a standard method known to protect MHC class I ligands from degradation during purification; (b) the possibility of exopeptidase contamination of the immunoaffinity column arising either from the murine mAb or from the cell lysate was ruled out by control experiments showing absence of degradation of synthetic precursors. The experimental conditions in these control experiments would have favored the action of any putative exopeptidase, because the three synthetic peptides were incubated in the column at neutral pH, which favors the action of these enzymes. During isolation of class I-bound peptides, these are protected from enzymatic degradation in their bound state, and peptide dissociation was carried out at pH 2, which strongly disfavors most exopeptidase activity. Binding of the peptidic NH2 terminus in the A pocket makes a significant contribution to stability of MHC-peptide complexes. A network of H-bonds is established between the peptidic NH2-terminal group and A pocket residues from the MHC class I molecule (1Madden D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 4Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Substitution of the peptidic NH2terminus by a methyl group decreases the Tm of the MHC-peptide complex by 22 °C (5Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 265: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This significant decrease in stability could be explained by loss of three H-bonds in the A pocket, as a consequence of the fact that the CH3-terminal group was located away from the A pocket and the position naturally occupied by the NH2-terminal group was filled by a water molecule (28Bouvier M. Guo H.C. Smith K.J. Wiley D.C. Proteins. 1998; 33: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This loss in stability contributes to explain that the overwhelming majority of classical MHC class I ligands have a free NH2 terminus. However, that this feature may occasionally be nonessential was recently demonstrated by our report of a natural N α-acetylated ligand of HLA-B39 (16Yague J. Alvarez I. Rognan D. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although the mode of binding of this peptide to the class I molecule remains unknown, it was suggested that N α -acetylated P1 residue might not occupy the A pocket and this might be occupied by water molecules that would partially compensate for the absence of a free NH2-terminal group. A recent report described the crystal structure of an HTLV-1-derived Tax8 peptide lacking the amino-terminal binding residue, refolded in vitro with HLA-A*0201 (17Khan A.R. Baker B.M. Ghosh P. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6398-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this complex, the conformation of the bound peptide was very similar to that of its NH2-terminally extended Tax9 counterpart, except at the A pocket, which was occupied only by two water molecules. This mode of binding was less stable than binding of the canonical counterpart (ΔTm = −16 °C), as also reported for H-2 K d (29Fahnestock M.L. Johnson J.L. Feldman R.M. Tsomides T.J. Mayer J. Narhi L.O. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8149-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but did not prevent formation of a “closed conformation” of the peptide binding site. In an earlier report (18Utz U. Koenig S. Coligan J.E. Biddison W.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 214-221PubMed Google Scholar), Tax8 sensitized HLA-A2-positive targets for lysis by Tax-specific CTL from HTLV-1-infected individuals expanded in vitro with this peptide. Although these results are compatible with Tax8 being a natural HLA-A2 ligand, this seems unlikely on the basis of the limited stability of Tax8/HLA-A2 complexes (17Khan A.R. Baker B.M. Ghosh P. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6398-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Utz et al. (18Utz U. Koenig S. Coligan J.E. Biddison W.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 214-221PubMed Google Scholar) did not rule out the possibility that the CTL reactivity observed could be the result of cross-reaction of some CTL activated in vivo against the dominant Tax9 epitope. That such cross-reaction did not occur with a Tax9-specific CTL clone (17Khan A.R. Baker B.M. Ghosh P. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6398-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) does not rule out this possibility in a polyclonal T-cell response. For instance, Tax-specific CTL clones critically depend on interactions with a cluster of 3 residues (Arg65, Lys66, Ala69) in the HLA-A2 α1-helix, but reactivity of individual clones is affected differently by mutations at each of these positions (30Baker B.M. Turner R.V. Gagnon S.J. Wiley D.C. Biddison W.E. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which underlines clonal diversity. The similar binding of HVAVENAL relative to NAc-SHVAVENAL could be explained on the basis that the latter peptide lacks a free NH2 terminus, so that the NAc-Ser group may not bind in the A pocket, and the binding mode of the acetylated ligand might actually be similar to HVAVENAL. However, this explanation cannot apply to the similar behavior of the EHAGVISVL/HAGVISVL peptide pair in our in vitro assays. It should be noted that loss of a P1 residue with free NH2terminus is reflected in our epitope stabilization assay. For instance, binding of HVAVENAL or NAc-SHAVAVENAL was ∼10-fold lower in this assay than binding of SHVAVENAL (16Yague J. Alvarez I. Rognan D. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two alternative explanations can be proposed for the similar binding of EHAGVISVL/HAGVISVL. First, stabilization of the (−P1) peptide by sequence-dependent anchors might be high enough as to make the relative contribution of the canonical NH2 terminus to the overall binding affinity and stability sufficiently small to go unnoticed in our assays. This is unlikely to be a general rule and would explain why only few (−P1) peptides have been found. Related to this, it is possible that removal of P1 residues, whose side chains make a negative contribution to the overall binding energy in peptides well stabilized by other anchors, might favor presence of the corresponding (−P1) ligands. A second possibility is that stabilization of the A pocket by H-bonded water molecules might be higher for HLA-B39 ligands with His as the B pocket-binding residue, than for ligands of HLA-A2 or other class I molecules. Structural differences among class I molecules in the A pocket, and the polarity of the peptidic His, might provide a possible basis for higher water-mediated stabilization of the MHC/(−P1) peptide complex. For instance, although the three HLA-B39 allotypes in our study bind peptides with either Arg2 or His2, the four (−P1) ligands found had His as the B pocket-binding motif. Moreover, after extensive studies in our laboratory with HLA-B27-bound peptides, which have Arg2, we never found evidence for (−P1) peptides from this class I protein. Ultimately, x-ray diffraction studies would be required to establish the binding mode of natural His-containing (−P1) ligands in complex with HLA-B39. The apparently similar binding properties of the (−P1) peptides described in this study relative to their NH2-terminally extended counterparts, their structural similarities, notably the NH2-terminal His residue, and the well established contribution of the canonical NH2 terminus to peptide stability (5Bouvier M. Wiley D.C. Science. 1994; 265: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), suggest that occurrence of (−P1) ligands in vivo is rare among class I MHC proteins, although it may be somewhat more frequent in particular allotypes, such as HLA-B39. (−P1) ligands arising from internal protein sequences may be directly produced by the proteasome, along with their NH2-terminally extended counterparts, or result from aminopeptidase trimming further down in the antigen-processing pathway. However, finding of the HVAVENAL ligand was surprising because its NH2-terminally extended counterpart was N α-acetylated, and the sequence corresponded to the amino-terminal portion of a helicase (31You L.R. Chen C.M. Yeh T.S. Tsai T.Y. Mai R.T. Lin C.H. Lee Y.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2841-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro digestion of an N α-acetylated synthetic precursor with 20 S proteasome resulted in direct generation of NAc-SHVAVENAL and absence of cleavage after NAc-Ser (16Yague J. Alvarez I. Rognan D. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several possibilities may be considered to explain the presence of HVAVENAL as a natural HLA-B39 ligand. First, it could arise from an internal protein region, independent from the DBX helicase from which NAc-SHVAVENAL most likely arose (16Yague J. Alvarez I. Rognan D. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out this possibility, but consider it unlikely because HVAVENAL did not match any sequence in the protein data base other than that of the DBX helicase. Second, HVAVENAL might be directly generated by the proteasome before NH2-terminal acetylation, for instance, during degradation of incorrect DBX polypeptides. This possibility would also appear unlikely because the proteasome cleaves inefficiently near the free NH2 termini of protein substrates. A third possibility, which we favor, is that HVAVENAL is generated after proteasomal generation of a peptide precursor by amino-peptidase trimming. Such precursor might arise from nonacetylated or acetylated DBX polypeptides. The latter situation would imply a role of cytosolic acyl-amino acid-releasing enzymes (32Tsunasawa S. Narita K. Ogata K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 77: 89-102PubMed Google Scholar, 33Mitta M. Ohnogi H. Mizutani S. Sakiyama F. Kato I. Tsunasawa S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Scaloni A. Ingallinella P. Andolfo A. Jones W. Marino G. Manning J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in the generation of a class I ligand. In conclusion, our results demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that classical MHC class I molecules bind in vivopeptides lacking the canonical P1 residue. Together with our previous report of an N α-acetylated ligand (16Yague J. Alvarez I. Rognan D. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), this is a second example of natural class I ligands lacking a canonical structure at their NH2 termini. The functional significance of (−P1) ligands is unknown, but their presence should be taken into account for epitope prediction and mapping, both in defensive T-cell responses and autoimmunity.

https://openalex.org/W2142117432,"The molecular interactions driving reactive center loop (RCL) insertion are of considerable interest in gaining a better understanding of the serpin inhibitory mechanism. Previous studies have suggested that interactions in the proximal hinge/breach region may be critical determinants of RCL insertion in serpins. In this study, conformational and functional changes in plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-2) following incubation with a panel of synthetic RCL peptides indicated that the P14 residue is critical for RCL insertion, and hence inhibitory activity, in PAI-2. Only RCL peptides with a P14 threonine were able to induce the stressed to relaxed transition and abolish inhibitory activity in PAI-2, indicating that RCL insertion into β-sheet A of PAI-2 is dependent upon this residue. The recently solved crystal structure of relaxed PAI-2 (PAI-2·RCL peptide complex) allowed detailed analysis of molecular interactions involving P14 related to RCL insertion. Of most interest is the rearrangement of hydrogen bonding around the breach region that accompanies the stressed to relaxed transition, in particular the formation of a side chain hydrogen bond between the threonine at P14 and an adjacent tyrosine on strand 2 of β-sheet B in relaxed PAI-2. Structural alignment of known serpin sequences showed that this pairing (or the equivalent serine/threonine pairing) is highly conserved (∼87%) in inhibitory serpins and may represent a general structural basis for serpin inhibitory activity."
