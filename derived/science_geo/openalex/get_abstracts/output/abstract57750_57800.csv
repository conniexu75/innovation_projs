https://openalex.org/W1996404286,"THE discovery that messenger RNA (mRNA) in mammalian cells contains sequences of polyadenylic acid (poly A) about 200 nucleotides long localized at the 3′-OH terminus of the mRNA molecule1–5 has raised questions about the function of poly A, but has also provided a powerful new tool for the study of mRNA metabolism. I have measured the stability of mRNA in exponentially growing mouse L-cells without having to resort to the use of inhibitors of RNA synthesis, and found that poly A-containing mRNA has a half-life of 10 h, and thus turns over approximately once per cell generation (15 h). This high stability is in striking contrast to the 3–4 h half-life for mRNA in cultured cells obtained by following the decay of polyribosomes after treatment with a high dose of actinomycin D6,7, This, however, agrees with the finding of Cheevers and Sheinin8 that there is a long-lived fraction of mRNA in cells treated with a low dose of actinomycin D. Singer and Penman9 have simultaneously found that poly A-containing mRNA in HeLa cells turns over about once per cell generation."
https://openalex.org/W1500414173,"Abstract The polypeptide elongation factors Tu-GDP, Ts and Tu-Ts have been purified from Escherichia coli to homogeneous state as judged by criteria of ultracentrifugation and disc gel electrophoresis. The DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography of the ammonium sulfate fraction (37 to 64% saturation) of E. coli 150,000 x g supernatant yielded two peaks of T activity, i.e. Peaks I and II which are identified as Tu-Ts and Tu-GDP, respectively. Tu-GDP is purified from Peak II through Sephadex G-100 column chromatography and ammonium sulfate fractionation, and crystallized as long hexagonals with pyramidal bases. The crystalline Tu-GDP has a specific activity of 21,000 to 23,000 pmoles of [3H]GDP bound per mg of protein, or approximately 1 mole of GDP per 44,000 to 48,000 g of protein. Ts is purified from Peak I (Tu-Ts), after resolution to Tu-GDP and Ts with GDP, through chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex column in the presence of 10-5 m GDP. After ammonium sulfate fractionation, the homogeneous preparation of Ts is obtained. The purified Ts catalyzes the exchange of 320,000 to 340,000 pmoles of [3H]GDP with Tu-GDP per min at 0° per mg of protein. Tu-Ts complex is purified from Peak I through Sephadex G-100 and second DEAE-Sephadex column chromatography and crystallized as needles. An alternate procedure for the purification of Ts and Tu-GDP which involves the resolution of Tu-Ts complex into Ts and Tu-GDP at earlier step of purification (first ammonium sulfate fraction) has also been described."

Complete disulfide bond reduction and S-carboxymethylation was achieved in liquid ammonia. Sequence determination of five tryptic fragments led to the proposed primary structure."

https://openalex.org/W1553906832,"Abstract Escherichia coli strain W is capable of actively transporting l-cystine as well as the structurally related compound α, e-diaminopimelic acid. Cystine transport is mediated by two systems distinguishable on the basis of specificity and affinity for substrate. The cystine general system (Km = 3 x 10-7 m) also transports diaminopimelic acid and is inhibited by a variety of analogues, while the cystine specific system (Km = 2 x 10-8 m) is much more selective. A mutant strain, D2W, has only the lower affinity general system (Km = 1 x 10-7 m). The two systems display differing sensitivities toward osmotic shock. When cells are grown in a minimal medium, the general system is entirely lost from each strain by shock, Whereas the specific system of W is unaffected. The shock fluids from these cells contain a single protein capable of binding cystine (the cystine general binding protein), and the binding is completely inhibited by diaminopimelate. This binding activity is reduced by 90% in mutants of strain D2W lacking the general transport system. When strain W is grown in an enriched medium, the general system is absent, but the activity of the specific system is increased 3-fold and can now be reduced by osmotic shock. The cystine general binding protein is absent from the shock fluid, but we now find the appearance of a cystine binding activity with a specificity similar to that of the specific transport system. The cystine general binding protein has been purified to homogeneity and has properties similar to those reported for other shock-releasable binding proteins. Its specificity closely parallels that of the general transport system. The results support the concept that the cystine general binding protein is involved in the recognition step of the general transport system."

https://openalex.org/W2079433581,"THE increasing importance of amniocentesis for the diagnosis of disease in utero has focused attention on the cells obtained by this procedure. Culture of amniotic fluid cells is becoming an established procedure for the identification of foetuses with chromosomal and metabolic abnormalities. Cytogenetic and biochemical studies of these cells in culture and morphological studies of the uncultured cells have shown that they are of foetal origin1–3. However, the exact origin of the cells which grow remains speculative and several possibilities have been suggested including exfoliated cells from the amnion or from foetal skin2,3 and also from the foetal respiratory4 and urogenital3,4 tracts. Since foetal urine undoubtedly contributes to the amniotic fluid as gestation progresses5 it seemed reasonable to assume that some of the cells cultured from amniotic fluid could be derived from the foetal urinary tract."

https://openalex.org/W1520442284,"Abstract Chloramphenicol inhibits binding of aminoacyl-oligonucleotides to ribosomes from Escherichia coli. These aminoacyl-oligonucleotides, C-A-C-C-A(Phe), C-C-A(Phe), C-C-A(Lys), C-C-A(Ser), and C-C-A(Leu), represent the aminoacyl-terminal fragments of aminoacyl-tRNA. Thus, it is possible that chloramphenicol inhibits the binding of this portion of aminoacyl-tRNA during its inhibition of protein synthesis. Of the four chloramphenicol enantiomers, only the active antibacterial isomer was effective. In addition, binding of [14C]chloramphenicol to ribosomes, studied by equilibrium dialysis, revealed two sites for chloramphenicol binding to ribosomes: a high affinity (Kdiss = 2 x 10-6 m) and a low affinity (Kdiss = 2 x 10-4 m) site. Many antibiotics were found to inhibit [14C]chloramphenicol binding: carbomycin, vernamycin A, lincomycin, gougerotin, sparsomycin, and puromycin. Puromycin appears to compete with chloramphenicol for similar or identical binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W1507927088,"Abstract RNase I of Salmonella typhimurium has been purified to a homogeneous state. It has a molecular weight of 2 x 104. Association of RNase I with the 30 S subunits of ribosomes has been investigated by using an inhibition assay. 70 S ribosomes and 30 S subunits, but not the 50 S subunits, inhibit the hydrolysis of polyribonucleotides (only poly adenylic acid was used in the present investigation) by RNase I. This inhibition is Mg++-dependent. Each 30 S subunit appears to bind approximately 3 molecules of enzyme. The three-dimensional configuration of the ribosomes is essential for the inhibition since removal of even a small amount of protein by salt extraction leads to considerable loss of inhibitory activity; the detached proteins have no inhibitory activity. Although ribosomal RNA has some inhibitory activity, it is much less than that of the intact ribosomes. Reconstitution of the ribosomes from the salttreated particles and detached proteins leads to complete recovery of the inhibitory activity. This inhibition assay can be very conveniently used in measuring the purity of subunit preparations from 70 S ribosomes as well as in the study of the reconstitution of the ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1586819602,"The requirement for PI, a protein component of the 50 S ribosomal subunit of Escherichia coli shown previously to be essential for the interaction of the translation factors EF-T and EF-G with ribosomes, is minimized under certain conditions in partial reactions that can occur independently of chain elongation. Although very little EF-G binding occurs to PI-deficient ribosomes in the presence of GTP or GDP, significant amounts of EF-G can be bound with 5′-guanylylmethylenediphosphonate. EF-T-dependent GTP hydrolysis and EF-G-dependent binding of guanine nucleotides, as well as the associated EF-G-dependent GTPase activity carried out under stoichiometric conditions, were found to be much less dependent on PI in the presence of 20% methanol. These observations indicate that the catalytic sites of the PI-deficient-ribosomes are basically intact, and that PI plays an auxiliary role in enhancing the interaction of the elongation factors with the active sites of the ribosomes. End group analysis indicates that PI contains a minimum of two polypeptides with methionine and serine as NH2-terminal residues. Correspondence of PI to the ribosomal proteins reported by others is suggested on the basis of polyacrylamide gel pattern and amino acid composition."

https://openalex.org/W1582738455,"Abstract The rate of binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to apoglutamate decarboxylase from Escherichia coli can be measured by absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and enzyme activity. All four methods give the same results under all conditions examined. At pH 4.9 in pyridinium chloride buffers the binding at a given coenzyme concentration follows first order kinetics. The rate is not first order in coenzyme, but instead levels off at coenzyme concentrations near 1 mm. A plot of the reciprocal of the observed first order rate constant versus the reciprocal of the coenzyme concentration is linear. The binding of 4-deoxypyridoxine 5'-phosphate, like that of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, follows saturation kinetics, and thus involves at least two distinct steps. The dissociation constant for the first step (0.084 mm) and the rate constant for the second step (0.14 min-1) differ only slightly from those for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate under the same conditions (0.19 mm and 0.20 min-1, respectively). The pKa of the phenolic hydroxyl group of the deoxy compound is shifted downward by more than 3 units on binding to the enzyme. These data are used to derive a general mechanism for the binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to glutamate decarboxylase. [see PDF for equation] Complex-I is a rapidly formed complex in which there is weak association between the phosphate of the coenzyme or analog and the protein. The interconversion of Complex-I and Complex-II is a conformation change of the protein and is rate-determining. The catalytically active Schiff base is formed in the last step. The kinetic constants in the above scheme vary according to the anion present. Much faster binding is observed in pyridinium chloride buffer than in pyridinium sulfate or acetate. Fluoride is also a potent a ctivator of the binding The rate constant for the binding of the coenzyme under optimum conditions is at least 100-fold smaller than that predicted from model reactions. In dilute solution and at higher pH the enzyme dissociates into subunits. Coenzyme binding to the dissociated enzyme is several times faster than binding to the aggregated enzyme. 3-Pyridinemethanol phosphate, benzyl phosphate, and inorganic phosphate inhibit the binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to apoglutamate decarboxylase. The inhibition constants are 3.0, 25, and 40 mm, respectively, at pH 4.9. This indicates that the binding of the coenzyme to the protein involves ionic bonding to the phosphate and hydrogen bonding to the pyridine nitrogen, but probably not hydrophobic or charge-transfer bonding to the aromatic ring."
https://openalex.org/W1923848532,"Abstract The ATP-dependent cleavage of urea, catalyzed by urea amidolyase, occurs in two steps: (a) urea + ATP + HCO3- (Mg++, K+)/⇌ allophanate + ADP + Pi; and (b) allophanate → 2 HCO3- + 2 NH4+. The enzyme, purified approximately 150-fold from extracts of Candida utilis, contains high levels of covalently bound biotin and is very sensitive to inhibition by avidin. Furthermore, under controlled conditions, [14C]biotin is incorporated covalently into the enzyme when its formation is induced. The biotin-free apoenzyme of urea amidolyase has been isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown under biotin-deficient conditions. This apoenzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of allophanate but does not catalyze the net cleavage of urea. The in vitro conversion of the apoenzyme to the holoenzyme requires ATP, Mg++ ions, d-biotin, and a low molecular weight holoenzyme synthetase from S. cerevisiae. Chemically prepared d-biotinyl 5'-adenylate will substitute for d-biotin and ATP in this process."

https://openalex.org/W1505145460,"Abstract Aminoacyl-oligonucleotides representing the terminal fragments of aminoacyl-tRNA were synthesized and characterized: C-A-C-C-A(Phe), C-C-A(Phe), C-C-A(Leu), C-C-A-(Lys), C-C-A(Ser), C-C-A(Glu) and C-C-A(Ala). Since these fragments represent the aminoacyl-end of aminoacyltRNA, it was not surprising to find that puromycin inhibits their binding. In addition, their binding to ribosomes was stimulated by ethanol. Their affinity to ribosomes was in the order C-C-A(Phe) g C-C-A(Leu) g C-C-A(Lys) g C-C-A(Ser) g C-C-A(Ala) g C-C-A(Glu). Since their oligonucleotide portions are identical, it is evident that differences in their binding to ribosomes reflect differences in interaction of their amino acid residues with ribosomes and may have physiological significance. These aminoacyloligonucleotides are able to serve as acceptors for the transfer of peptide from peptidyl-tRNA. However, they are poor and ineffective as donors in the puromycin reaction. In addition, in the presence of ethanol these compounds readily undergo ethanolysis to form the respective aminoacyl ethyl esters. Furthermore, washing of ribosomes with 1 m NH4Cl and 0.01 m MgCl2 is not sufficient to remove completely peptidyl-tRNA from ribosomes."

Lyon also postulated that inactivation of X chromosomes occurs in early embryonic development and implied that, once inactivation occurs in any one cell, all descendants of that cell carry the same inactive X chromosome."

If the first transplant immunizes the patient or is rejected by immunologically responsive patients, second grafts into the same patients would be expected to be rejected at a higher rate. Only those reject who reject first grafts hyperacutely or between 1 to 3 months were found to have low second graft survival rates. Patients who rejected transplants after 3 months tended to have second transplant survival rates which were higher than their first graft survival rates."

https://openalex.org/W1576744437,"Abstract 1. Polyinosinic acid (poly(I)) is capable of releasing the DNA template restrictions of rat liver nuclei or soluble chromatin when assayed with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase. In contrast, polycytidylic acid (poly(C)) is completely ineffective. 2. The ability of poly(I) to release the DNA template restrictions is dependent on the size of the poly(I). Poly(I) with sedimentation values from 4.1 to 12.5 S are good template activators while an equivalent amount of the smaller poly(I) with an s20,w value of 2.5 is far less effective. In comparison, poly(C) with sedimentation values from 3.1 to 13.2 S are incapable of activating the template DNA of either rat liver nuclei or chromatin. 3. The similarity of the poly(I) effect on both isolated nuclei and soluble chromatin indicate that the specificity of the polymer for DNA template activation is not determined by its ability to pass through the nuclear membrane. 4. The double-stranded homopolymer pair poly(I)·poly(C) is completely ineffective in activating template DNA. Similarly, the nuclear template-activating ability of poly(I) can be totally inhibited if the bases of the poly(I) are methylated in the N-7 position. 5. Radioactive poly(I), but not radioactive poly(C), is capable of binding to isolated rat liver nuclei and soluble chromatin. Similarly, poly(I), but not poly(C), produced an optical clearing of nuclear suspensions when measured at A600 nm. This phenomenon was accompanied by a release of DNA from the nuclei. 6. Poly(I), and to a lesser extent poly(C), was able to protect high molecular weight DNA in nuclei from degradation when nuclear suspensions were incubated at 37° in the presence of 2.5 mm magnesium ion. 7. DNA template characteristics of calf thymus DNA could be completely inhibited by the addition of unfractionated calf thymus histones. Large sizes of poly(I) were specifically able to reactivate the template properties of these histoneinhibited DNA preparations. 8. These results indicate that the ability of specific polyribonucleotides to activate template DNA depends on several characteristics of the polymer including its composition, size, and secondary structure in solution."

These claims can be questioned on several grounds."
https://openalex.org/W1603366682,Abstract A map of the structural gene for T4 DNA polymerase (gene 43) was constructed based on the immunological cross-reactivity and the molecular weights of the peptides generated by a series of amber mutants that map in this gene. The physical map deduced in this way was in good agreement with the genetic map determined on the basis of recombination frequencies. Analysis of the size and cross-reactivity of the amber peptides also demonstrated that the T4 DNA polymerase gene is translated in a counter-clockwise direction along the circular genetic map of phage T4. This is the same direction that the lysozyme and rII genes of T4 are translated and is in the direction opposite to that of genes known to specify the structural components of the T4 capsid.
