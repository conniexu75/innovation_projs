https://openalex.org/W1652316604,"Bovine milk galactosyltransferase has been used, in conjunction with UDP-[3H]galactose, as an impermeant probe for accessible GlcNAc residues on the surfaces of lymphocytes. Galactosylation of living thymic lymphocytes is dependent upon cell number, enzyme concentration, UDP-galactose concentration, and Mn2+ concentration. Kinetics of labeling are biphasic, leveling off at approximately 30 min. The data strongly indicate vectorial surface labeling and covalent attachment of galactose. Thymocytes, T-lymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes have approximately 10(6), 3 X 10(6), and 5 X 10(6) galactosylatable sites on their cell surfaces, respectively. Numerous proteins are exogalactosylated that differ quantitatively among the major functional subsets of lymphocytes. Negligible radioactivity is found in lipid. In thymocytes, 49% of the exogalactosylated oligosaccharides are alkali labile, whereas 80 and 90% of that derived from T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes can be beta-eliminated, respectively. Sensitivity of the intact proteins or tryptic peptides to the peptide: N-glycosidase also confirms the relative amounts of cell surface, N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides which are exogalactosylated. Composition, size, and high performance liquid chromatography on two types of high resolution columns establish that the bulk of the exogalactosylated, beta-eliminated oligosaccharides are Gal beta 1-4GlcNAcitol. These data suggest the presence of O-glycosidically linked GlcNAc monosaccharide on many lymphocyte cell-surface proteins. However, additional experiments indicate that the majority of these moieties appear to be cryptic or inside the cell. Thus, these studies not only describe dramatic differences in the amounts and distribution of terminal GlcNAc residues on phenotypically different lymphocyte populations, but they also describe the presence of a novel protein-saccharide linkage, which is present on numerous lymphocyte proteins."

Light-carrying fibers are potentially useful in oximetry, dye dilution measurements, laser-Doppler velocimetry, and fluorometry; as physical sensors of temperature, pressure, and radiation; and as chemical sensors of pH, partial pressure of blood gases, and glucose. Emphasis is placed on the principles and ideas used in the various devices rather than on detailed descriptions or critical discussions."

The two apolipoproteins (Mr = 245,000 and 78,000; designated apoLp-I and apoLp-II, respectively) were readily dissociated and separated in 6 M guanidine HCl by gel permeation chromatography. ApoLp-I and apoLp-II showed no immunological cross-reactivity on electrophoretic blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. ApoLp-I and apoLp-II from lipophorin of adult M. sexta behaved identically to their larval counterparts. Amino acid compositions of larval apoLp-I and apoLp-II were similar except with respect to tryptophan and cysteine; apoLp-I contained 32 residues/mol of tryptophan (1.5 mol%) and 22 residues/mol (1.1 mol%) of cysteine; apoLp-II contained 2 residues/mol of tryptophan (0.2 mol%) and 14 residues/mol of cysteine (2.1 mol%). In double immunodiffusion tests, antiserum against apoLp-I or whole lipophorin strongly precipitated lipophorin, while antiserum against apoLp-II caused only minor precipitation. This indicates relatively greater exposure of apoLp-I to the aqueous environment."
https://openalex.org/W1552233144,"Chromogranin A (CgA), the major catecholamine storage vesicle (CSV) soluble protein, may index exocytotic sympathoadrenal secretion. To explore CgA in adrenergic tissues, we developed a radioimmunoassay for bovine CgA. Within adrenal medulla CSV, several minor chromogranins had similar amino acid compositions and peptide maps to that of CgA and also showed parallel, partial cross-reactivity in the CgA radioimmunoassay. CgA immunoreactivity represented 7 +/- 1% of total adrenal medulla cell protein and was localized to adrenal CSV, representing 46 +/- 2% of CSV soluble protein. In brain, there was 1000-fold less CgA than in adrenal medulla, with a widespread regional distribution (maximal in neocortex) and an unusual subcellular distribution (maximal in cytosol), both of which differ from reported catecholamine distribution. Brain chromogranin immunoreactivity also had a lower Stokes radius than adrenal CgA. Sympathetic nerve and serum had 6,000-fold and 30,000-fold less CgA than that in adrenal medulla. The results suggest a family of adrenal medulla chromogranins, similar structurally and immunoligically. Adrenal medulla and brain chromogranin differ in concentration, subcellular localization, and molecular size. Finally, CgA in serum may provide a useful tool for sympathoadrenal studies in intact organisms."

In all of the subjects, the interictal spike in the scalp electroencephalogram was associated with an orderly extracranial magnetic field pattern. In eight of these subjects, multiple current sources underlay the magnetic spike complex. The multiple sources within a given subject displayed a fixed chronological sequence of discharge, demonstrating a high degree of spatial and temporal organization within the interictal focus."
https://openalex.org/W1527612304,"A new specific and sensitive method for determination of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in plasma samples has been used to demonstrate the presence of a fast inhibitor to t-PA in plasma. By adding [35S]Met internally labeled t-PA (Mr approximately 70,000) to plasma, we were able to demonstrate the rapid formation of a stable complex with an apparent molecular weight of about 115,000 as estimated by gel filtration. The complex was partially purified by immunoadsorbtion chromatography on insolubilized antibodies against porcine t-PA, and a molecular weight of about 120,000 was found by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. From the apparent molecular weight of the complex (120,000) and the molecular weight of t-PA (70,000), a molecular weight of about 50,000 would be expected for the inhibitor. However, gel filtration of inhibitor-rich plasma resulted in the appearance of a symmetrical peak of t-PA inhibitory activity with an apparent molecular weight of about 205,000. The reason for this discrepancy is not known, but several different models are possible."

https://openalex.org/W2120428061,"We have characterized a Rhizobium meliloti regulatory gene required for the expression of two closely linked symbiotic operons, the nitrogenase operon (nifHDK genes) and the “P2” operon. This regulatory gene maps to a 1.8 kb region located 5.5 kb upstream of the nifHDK operon. The regulatory gene is required for the accumulation of nifHDK and P2 mRNA and for the derepression of an R. meliloti nifH-lacZ fusion plasmid during symbiotic growth. The nifH and P2 promoters can be activated in free-living cultures of R. meliloti containing plasmids that produce the Escherichia coli ntrC(glnG) or the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifA regulatory gene products constitutively. The R. meliloti regulatory gene hybridizes to E. coli ntrC(glnG) and, to a lesser extent, to K. pneumoniae nifA DNA. Our results suggest that the R. meliloti regulatory gene acts as a positive transcriptional activator and that it is related to the K. pneumoniae nif regulatory genes."

https://openalex.org/W1518363574,"In order to provide some insight into the mechanism of hyaluronate synthesis, the subcellular localization of the synthetase system for hyaluronate was determined in eukaryotic cells. The mouse oligodendroglioma cell line G26-24, which produces copious amounts of hyaluronate in culture, was chosen as a system for these studies. Protease treatment and homogenization of cells followed by hyaluronate synthetase assay suggested that nucleotide-binding sites and trypsin-sensitive synthetase sites were not exposed at the outer membrane surface. Protease treatment following homogenization did result in decreased activity. Membrane fragments, prepared by gentle homogenization in iso- and hypotonic buffers, were subjected to differential centrifugation followed by several continuous and discontinuous sucrose equilibrium and velocity gradient systems. Hyaluronate synthetase activity co-fractionated with a plasma membrane marker in all systems, including those in which Golgi markers were separable. Treatment of intact cells in culture with several hyaluronidases resulted in a marked stimulation of cell-free synthetase activity. The stimulated activity was also found exclusively in plasma membrane-enriched fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1578941266,"A cytochrome P-450 catalyzing 26-hydroxylation of C27-steroids was purified from liver mitochondria of untreated rabbits. The enzyme fraction contained 10 nmol of cytochrome P-450/mg of protein and showed only one protein band with a minimum Mr = 53,000 upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 showed apparent molecular weight similar to microsomal cytochromes P-450LM4 but differed in spectral and catalytic properties from these microsomal isozymes. The purified cytochrome P-450 catalyzed 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol, 5-cholestene-3 beta,7 alpha-diol, 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha-diol, and 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol up to 1000 times more efficiently than the mitochondria. The cytochrome P-450 required both ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase for catalytic activity. Microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase could not replace ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase. The cytochrome P-450 was inactive in 7 alpha-, 12 alpha- and 25-hydroxylations of C27-steroids. The results suggest that mitochondrial 26-hydroxylation of various C27-steroids is catalyzed by the same species of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1534286697,"Histidine decarboxylase was purified from fetal rat liver about 3,000-fold by the method described previously (Watanabe, T., Nakamura, H., Leu, Y.L., Yamatodani, A., and Wada, H. (1979) Biochem. Pharmacol. 28, 1149-1155) except that DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were added. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 110,000 in the native state and gave a single band of protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a position corresponding to a molecular weight of 54,000, indicating that it was a dimer. Its isoelectric point was pH 5.1. Antibody raised in rabbits against the enzyme gave single fused precipitation lines with the enzymes from fetal rat liver and adult rat brain and stomach in Ouchterlony's double diffusion test, and inhibited these three enzymes similarly and strongly. Using this antibody, histidine decarboxylase-like immunoreactive structures were located in fetal liver and peritoneal mast cells, stomach and brain of rats."
https://openalex.org/W1573745764,"Human placental fibronectin was isolated from fresh term placenta by urea extraction and purified by gelatin affinity chromatography. A 44-kDa chymotryptic fragment, also purified by gelatin affinity chromatography, gave a broad, diffuse band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas the analogous 43-kDa fragment from human plasma fibronectin migrated as a defined, narrow band. Upon extended treatment with endo-beta-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii, the 44-kDa chymotryptic gelatin-binding fragment from placental fibronectin changed its behavior on gel electrophoresis and migrated as a narrower, more defined band. The carbohydrates on human placental fibronectin contained a large percentage of polylactosamine structures, part of which occurred on the gelatin-binding fragment, comprising almost twice as much carbohydrate as plasma fibronectin. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the chymotryptic gelatin-binding fragments from both fibronectins showed the first 21 residues to be identical. Tryptic and chymotryptic peptide maps of the gelatin-binding fragment from placental fibronectin, however, showed differences including several protease-resistant domains not found in the analogous fragment from plasma fibronectin. Intact placental fibronectin contains 20,000 Da of carbohydrate, whereas plasma fibronectin contains 11,000 Da. Placental fibronectin is more protease-resistant than plasma fibronectin, possibly due to the additional carbohydrate. Polyclonal antibodies against either fibronectin completely cross-react with amniotic fluid fibronectin, placental fibronectin, and plasma fibronectin upon Ouchterlony immunodiffusion. Human fibronectins of putatively the same polypeptide structure are, therefore, glycosylated in a dramatically different fashion, depending on the tissue of expression. If the patterns of glycosylation comprise the only difference in the glycoprotein, this may confer the characteristic protease resistance found for each of the fibronectins."
https://openalex.org/W1488791609,"Two complementing mutations in lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis have been isolated following a [3H]mannose suicide enrichment. Rather than making the wild type precursor oligosaccharide, Glc3man9Glc-NA2-P-P-dolichol, the mutants, alg5-1 and alg6-1, accumulate Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol as their largest lipid-linked oligosaccharide in vivo and in vitro. When UDP-[3H]Glc was added to microsomal membranes of each mutant, neither could elongate Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol and only alg6-1 could synthesize dolichol-phosphoglucose. When dolicholphospho[3H]glucose was added to microsomes from alg5-1, alg6-1, or the parental strain, only alg5-1 and the parental strain made glucosylated lipid-linked oligosaccharides. These results indicate that alg5-1 cells are unable to synthesize dolichol phosphoglucose while alg6-1 cells are unable to transfer glucose from dolichol phosphoglucose to the unglucosylated lipid-linked oligosaccharide. We also present evidence that both mutants transfer Man9GlcNAc2 to protein."

https://openalex.org/W1480478154,"Abstract Bovine Factor V was partially activated with bovine beta-thrombin and activation intermediates, and end products were isolated either by column chromatography under nondenaturing conditions or electroelution from slab gels following electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate or both. Electrophoresis of partially activated single-chain Factor V (Mr = 330,000) revealed intermediates designated B (Mr congruent to 205,000) and C (Mr congruent to 150,000), plus end products designated C1 (Mr congruent to 120,000), D (Mr congruent to 94,000), E (Mr congruent to 74,000), F (Mr congruent to 71,000), and G (Mr congruent to 31,000). All components except C1 were visualized readily by staining with Coomassie blue. C1, however, did not stain with this dye but was readily visualized with the Schiff-periodate or silver staining procedures. Chromatography of samples of partially activated Factor V on QAE (quaternary aminoethyl)-cellulose in Ca2+ yielded fractions consisting, respectively, of B plus C and B plus D. Both were biologically active, but the former pair required further exposure to thrombin to yield activity, whereas the latter did not. Either pair, when treated with EDTA, lost activity and could be resolved by further chromatography on QAE-cellulose into isolated components B, C, and D. Activity was recovered upon reconstitution of the pairs in Ca2+, suggesting that B plus C or B plus D comprise two subunit proteins, both subunits of which are required for biological activity. Gel electrophoretic analysis of isolated B and C, after further exposure to thrombin, indicated that B is the precursor of end products C1, E, and G, whereas C is the precursor of D and F. Conventional NH2-terminal sequence analysis and amino acid composition analysis indicated that C and D share the same NH2 terminus with Factor V and that the weighted composition of B plus C is the same as Factor V. Microsequence analysis of C1 and E indicated that C1 has the NH2-terminal sequence of intermediate B, which differs from that of end product E. These results indicate that: 1) a single cleavage of Factor V yields B and C from the COOH and NH2 termini, respectively, of the parent; 2) the pair B and C constitute a Ca2+-stabilized protein of two subunits, both of which are required for subsequent expression of biological activity; 3) the precursor-product relationship between B and C and the end products of activation are: B----C1 + E + G, and C----D + F; and 4) end product D is derived from the NH2 terminus of C, and end product C1 is derived from the NH2 terminus of B."
https://openalex.org/W1587176335,"In the final stages of the terminal glycosylation of N-linked complex oligosaccharides, UDP-galactose: N-acetylglucosamine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (galactosyltransferase) transfers galactose (Gal) onto the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of each branch of a biantennary oligosaccharide. Purified rat liver Golgi galactosyltransferase was used with GlcNAc beta 1,2-Man alpha 1,6-(GlcNAc beta 1,2-Man alpha 1,3-)-Man beta 1,4-GlcNAc beta 1,4-(Fuc alpha 1,6-)-GlcNAc-Asn in order to determine the sequence of addition of Gal residues to the biantennary oligosaccharide. The different galactosylated products were separated by concanavalin A affinity chromatography and high voltage paper electrophoresis in borate. It was found that Gal was transferred at a much faster rate to the GlcNAc beta 1,2-Man alpha 1,3-branch than to the GlcNAc beta 1,2-Man alpha 1,6-branch, i.e. k1 was at least 5 times larger than k2. Also, k3 was larger than k4, indicating that most of the digalactosylated product GG was formed by the sequential addition of Gal to the Man alpha 1,3-branch followed by addition to the Man alpha 1,6-branch. The preferential galactosylation of the GlcNAc beta 1,2-Man alpha 1,3-branch may explain the formation of the asymmetrical oligosaccharides found in bovine and human IgG."

https://openalex.org/W2057574710,"The productively rearranged immunoglobulin mu chain gene and the translocated cellular oncogene c-myc are transcribed at high levels both in human Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying the t(8;14) chromosome translocation and in mouse plasmacytoma X Burkitt lymphoma cell hybrids. In the experiments reported here these genes were found to be repressed in mouse 3T3 fibroblast X Burkitt lymphoma cell hybrids. Such repression probably occurs at the transcriptional level since no human mu- and c-myc messenger RNA's are detectable in hybrid clones carrying the corresponding genes. It is therefore concluded that the ability to express these genes requires a differential B cell environment. The results suggest that the 3T3 cell assay may not be suitable to detect oncogenes directly involved in human B cell oncogenesis, since 3T3 cells apparently are incapable of transcribing an oncogene that is highly active in malignant B cells with specific chromosomal translocations."

https://openalex.org/W1486705206,"Immune interferon (IFN-gamma), endogenously labeled with [35S]methionine, was produced in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin. 35S-IFN-gamma, immunoprecipitated from the crude culture fluid with a monoclonal antibody, was resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into three monomeric forms with molecular weights of 25,000, 20,000, and 15,500, which we designate IFN-gamma I, II, and III, respectively. IFN-gamma I was the most, and IFN-gamma III the least, abundant in both immunoprecipitated 35S-IFN-gamma and chromatographically purified IFN-gamma preparations. Changes in the molecular size of the monomeric forms after glycosidase treatment suggested that IFN-gamma I contains more carbohydrate than IFN-gamma II, and that IFN-gamma III may not be glycosylated at all. Hence, the differences in the carbohydrate contents are likely to be the major cause of the molecular size heterogeneity of IFN-gamma I, II, and III."
https://openalex.org/W1496737953,"Four distinct nucleoside cleaving enzymes were detected in extracts of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes. Two of these were nucleoside phosphorylases: one was specific for pyrimidines and the other for purines. The other two enzymes were nucleoside hydrolases. These hydrolytic enzymes were partially purified and their substrate and inhibitor specificities were studied. One of the hydrolases was designated inosine/guanosine hydrolase. It required purine substrates containing a 9-beta-D-ribofuranosyl substituent. Neither 2'-deoxyinosine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, nor hypoxanthine arabinoside served as substrates. The kinetic patterns obtained from combined product analysis and the mutual competitive inhibition of this enzyme by inosine and guanosine suggested that these substrates were cleaved at a common catalytic site. Inhibitor studies with several deoxyinosines have demonstrated the importance of the 2'-, 3'-, and 5'-hydroxyl groups for efficient binding to the enzyme. Adenosine, which did not serve as a substrate, was a potent competitive inhibitor (Ki = 8 microM) with respect to both inosine and guanosine. This enzyme had a particle weight of 106,000 +/- 10,000 as determined by Sephadex chromatography. The other hydrolase was specific for 2'-deoxyinosine. It only accepted purine substrates with a 6-oxo- and a 9-beta-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl substituent. Inosine, hypoxanthine arabinoside and a variety of deoxyinosines were not substrates nor did they strongly inhibit this enzyme. This enzyme had a particle weight of 19,000 +/- 2,000 as determined by Sephadex chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1603579629,"To gain an understanding of why the polymannose-type oligosaccharide chain of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B is not processed to a complex-type chain in vivo, the processing of this glycoprotein was studied in two cell-free systems. Addition of native 125I-ribonuclease B to rat liver Golgi membranes in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc resulted in the conversion of the high mannose chain to a complex type as evidenced by the acquisition of resistance to digestion with endoglucosaminidase H. Processing was linearly dependent on time and on the amount of Golgi membranes. Omission of UDP-GlcNAc from the reaction mixtures completely abolished processing of the glycoprotein. Product identification studies confirmed that the formation of ribonuclease that was resistant to digestion with endoglucosaminidase H was accompanied by the appearance of a complex-type oligosaccharide that contained one or more terminal beta-GlcNAc residues. In vitro processing of 125I-ribonuclease B that had been denatured by reduction and alkylation revealed that the rate of complex chain formation was only slightly greater than that observed with the native enzyme. In contrast to the results obtained with the heterologous rat liver system, Golgi membranes from bovine pancreas failed to process native ribonuclease B to the complex form. However, bovine pancreas Golgi membranes did readily process the denatured form of the enzyme. The presence of a factor in bovine pancreas that binds only to native ribonuclease B and thereby prevents its oligosaccharide chain from being processed was considered to be unlikely on the basis of gel filtration studies and mixing experiments. These findings indicate that some aspect of the conformation of native ribonuclease B prevents one or more of the processing enzymes of bovine pancreas from acting on the oligosaccharide chain. In addition, the substrate specificity of this processing enzyme(s) differs markedly from its counterpart in rat liver. These two factors, conformation of the substrate and specificity of the processing enzymes, apparently combine to produce the high mannose oligosaccharide chain of ribonuclease B observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1498282556,"The phosphorylation of the proteins of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles has been investigated in HeLa cells. 32Pi labeling of intact cells indicated that, of the six major particle proteins, the most heavily phosphorylated was the C1-protein (Mr = 42,000). This protein, together with C2 (Mr = 44,000), is also phosphorylated by [gamma-32P]ATP in particle extracts and in particles that are purified by sedimentation or exclusion chromatography. The C-proteins, together with their particle-associated kinase, were partially purified from isolated particles following dissociation with micrococcal nuclease. Proteins C1 and C2 co-purify on phosphocellulose chromatography, and their peak overlaps with that of a casein kinase activity. Evidence suggesting that this kinase activity is responsible for C-protein phosphorylation includes 1) the phosphorylation of C-proteins in the fractions where they overlap with the kinase, 2) the phosphorylation of added C-protein by fractions of the casein kinase which lack detectable C-protein, and 3) the similarities in catalytic properties of the casein kinase- and C-protein-phosphorylating activities. The purified kinase activity is cyclic nucleotide and Ca2+ independent. It is stimulated by polyamines, inhibited by heparin, and utilizes either GTP or ATP with high affinity. Serine residues are the major phosphate acceptors. These properties indicate that the kinase is casein kinase II or a closely related enzyme. Moreover, purified casein kinase II from rabbit liver effectively phosphorylates C-protein. These results suggest that C-proteins may be natural substrates for nuclear casein kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W1521702354,"2,5-Anhydro-D-mannitol (100 to 200 mg/kg) decreased blood glucose by 17 to 58% in fasting mice, rats, streptozotocin-diabetic mice, and genetically diabetic db/db mice. Serum lactate in rats was elevated 56% by 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol, but this could be prevented by dichloroacetate (200 mg/kg) or thiamin (200 mg/kg). In hepatocytes from fasted rats, 1 mM 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol inhibited gluconeogenesis from a mixture of alanine, lactate, and pyruvate. It also inhibited glucose production and stimulated lactate formation from glycerol or dihydroxyacetone. Glycogenolysis in hepatocytes from fed rats was markedly inhibited by 1 mM 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol both in the presence or absence of 1 microM glucagon. 2,5-Anhydro-D-mannitol can be phosphorylated by fructokinase or hexokinase to the 1-phosphate and then by phosphofructokinase to the 1,6-bisphosphate. Rat liver glycogen phosphorylase was inhibited by 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1-phosphate (apparent Ki = 0.66 +/- 0.09 mM) but was little affected by 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-bisphosphate. Rat liver phosphoglucomutase was inhibited by 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1-phosphate (apparent Ki = 2.8 +/- 0.2 mM), whereas 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-bisphosphate served as an alternative activator (apparent K alpha = 7.0 +/- 0.5 microM). Rabbit liver pyruvate kinase was activated by 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-bisphosphate (apparent K alpha = 9.5 +/- 0.9 microM), whereas rabbit liver fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase was inhibited by 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 1,6-bisphosphate (apparent Ki = 3.6 +/- 0.3 microM). The phosphate esters of 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol would, therefore, be expected to inhibit glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and stimulate glycolysis in liver."
https://openalex.org/W1501582313,"When Tetrahymena pyriformis, strain NT-1, was warmed from a growth temperature of 15 degrees C to 39 degrees C, there was a rapid conversion of its sphingolipids from the nonhydroxy fatty acid-containing ceramide aminoethylphosphonate (NCAEP) predominant at low temperature to the alpha-hydroxy fatty acid-containing analog (HCAEP). The fatty acid composition of the freshly formed HCAEP strongly resembled that of the original NCAEP pool. An extensive utilization of NCAEP long chain bases for HCAEP formation was shown by prelabeling the NCAEP bases with [14C]serine. The specific radioactivities of both fatty acids and long chain bases of the two sphingolipid classes of cells prelabeled with [3H]palmitic acid at 15 degrees C and then warmed to 39 degrees C were compatible with a direct hydroxylation of the intact ceramide aminoethylphosphonate or free ceramide formed from it. Exogenously added alpha-hydroxypalmitic acid was not incorporated into the sphingolipids intact, but there was an active alpha-oxidation of alpha-hydroxy fatty acids, yielding nonhydroxy fatty acids one carbon atom shorter in length. In vitro experiments failed to demonstrate a direct hydroxylation of NCAEP, and nonhydroxy fatty acid-containing free ceramides were hydroxylated only sparingly. This inefficient hydroxylation is attributed to the rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of these substrates in vitro and to a limited availability of the added ceramides to the hydroxylating enzymes. The weight of the evidence from this study strongly favors the alpha-hydroxylation of fatty acids only when they are bound as elements of sphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1647232102,"A single cellular protein of Mr approximately 18,000 and pI near 5.1, recently identified as eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-4D, contains the unusual amino acid hypusine [N epsilon-(4-amino–2-hydroxybutyl)lysine] formed post-translationally from lysine with a structural contribution from the polyamine spermidine. When the 3H-labeled hypusine-containing protein isolated from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that were grown with radioactive polyamine is digested with trypsin and the digest is subjected to two-dimensional separation, a single radioactive peptide is seen. A labeled peptide that occupies this same position is found in a digest of the [3H]hypusine protein from human lymphocytes and the single hypusine-containing tryptic peptide from purified rabbit reticulocyte eIF-4D also moves to this identical position. Stepwise Edman degradation of the tryptic digest of CHO cell hypusine-protein releases the radioactivity as a single peak in accordance with our earlier evidence for a single hypusine residue per molecule of eIF-4D. The similar patterns of radioactive peptides obtained from tryptic digests of radioiodinated eIF-4D from CHO cells, human lymphocytes, and rabbit reticulocytes suggest a highly conserved primary structure for this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1506009149,"Radioiodinated apolipoprotein A-I was separated into two pools by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-150 superfine resin or by high performance liquid chromatography using a TSK-2000 column. The first pool, pool 1, was indistinguishable from unlabeled apo-A-I as judged by sedimentation equilibrium, circular dichroic measurements, and radial immunodiffusion. This pool self-associated according to a monomer-dimer-tetramer-octamer scheme and underwent the expected conformation changes with dissociation as reported previously for unlabeled apo-A-I. The radioiodinated material in pool 2 had less secondary structure as compared to the unlabeled material and did not self-associate. Protein in this pool was immunochemically less reactive than unlabeled apo-A-I. Kinetic studies, in vivo, demonstrated that these two pools of radioiodinated apo-A-I are also distinguished metabolically. Discussion centers around possible mechanisms of formation of the incompetent protein in pool 2 and factors that should be taken into consideration when using unfractionated radioiodinated apo-A-I for experimental studies."
https://openalex.org/W1980030754,"Cultured chromaffin cells from bovine adrenal medulla were found to contain primarily the B form of monoamine oxidase. This monoamine oxidase B enzyme was somewhat distinct from B enzymes from other sources, in that noradrenaline was a much poorer substrate than serotonin. Nonetheless, studies with selective inhibitors of the A form (clorgyline) and the B form [(-)-deprenyl] confirmed that chromaffin cell monoamine oxidase was the B form. The observation that chromaffin cell monoamine oxidase has poor affinity for catecholamines is consistent with physiological needs that require the cell to synthesize and store large amounts of catecholamines."
https://openalex.org/W1607476467,"Criteria have been set up for recognizing the trait of interconvertibility of transport System ASC, whereby it operates in a deprotonated form to mediate the transport of zwitterionic amino acids and in a protonated form to transport anionic amino acids. This trait has been detected by each criterion applied, in all the tested occurrences of System ASC, as follows: the Ehrlich ascites tumor cell in suspension; a cultured variant thereof in monolayer; the Chinese hamster ovary cell CHO-K1 in monolayer; the pigeon red blood cell in suspension; and the human red blood cell in suspension. We conclude that this trait is a general feature of System ASC which may we may use provisionally in defining the system."
https://openalex.org/W2097051453,"We have tested several structurally related haptens, conjugated to ovalbumin, for their effect on activation of an inducer T-cell clone reactive to the p-azobenzenearsonate (arsonate) hapten. Low concentrations of some analogs inhibited DNA synthesis and lympkokine production by the clone in response to arsanylated antigen, but not in response to the lectin concanavalin A. Inhibition was specific for this clone, since the response of clones reactive to other antigens was not blocked. Inhibition may result from competition of these analogs with arsonate at a site on the T cell. The effectiveness of blocking by arsonate analogs parallels their ability to bind to a previously described arsonate-binding site on the clone (Rao et al., accompanying paper). We suggest that the binding and blocking assays detect the same physiological arsonate-recognition site on the clone, and hence that the cell-surface arsonate-binding sites we have described mediate its physiological response to antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1569340460,"Incubation of Complex I (NADH-CoQ reductase) of ox heart mitochondria at 4 degrees C in the presence of 0.5 M NaClO4 followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation of the solubilized proteins results in the isolation of a resolved preparation still capable of catalyzing NADH-NAD+ transhydrogenation but having only low levels of NADH dehydrogenase activity. A number of NAD(H) analogues, including the photoaffinity probes, arylazido-beta-alanyl NAD+ (A3'-O-[3-[N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)amino]propionyl]NAD+ and arylazido-beta-alanyl AcPyAD+ (A3'-O-[3-[N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)amino]propionyl]AcPyAD+ can be utilized as substrates for transhydrogenation in this preparation. A further incubation (10 min) of the resolved NADH-NAD+ transhydrogenase in the presence of 0.5 M NaClO4, but now at 30 degrees C, results in the complete loss of this transhydrogenase activity. Photoaffinity labeling experiments utilizing arylazido-[3-3H]beta-alanyl NAD+ and arylazido-[3-3H]beta-alanyl AcPyAD+ with the resolved NADH-NAD+ transhydrogenase preparation prior to and following NaClO4 (30 degrees C) treatment indicates that the 42,000 molecular weight component of Complex I is the pyridine nucleotide binding site responsible for the major NADH-NAD+ (DD) transhydrogenase activity of Complex I."
https://openalex.org/W1595631219,"Abstract Chondrocytes from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma were pulse-labeled with [3H]serine for 30 min and chased, in the presence of cycloheximide, for times up to 300 min. The movement of newly synthesized core protein precursor of the proteoglycan through elements of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex was examined. Rough and smooth microsome fractions were obtained by centrifuging postmitochondrial supernatants from cell homogenates on discontinuous sucrose gradients. The core protein precursor was identified in subcellular fractions by (a) immunoprecipitation with an antiserum directed against the hyaluronate binding region of the core protein and the link protein and (b) its size on polyacrylamide gels. Labeled core protein precursor decreased from the microsomes with a t1/2 of 60 +/- 8 min, nearly the same as for the appearance of label in completed proteoglycan monomer (t1/2 = 58 +/- 13 min), consistent with a precursor-product relationship. After correcting for incomplete recovery of the core protein precursor in the microsomal fractions and for cross-contamination of the smooth microsomes by elements of rough endoplasmic reticulum, the redistribution of core protein precursor and completed proteoglycan in the intracellular compartments and of labeled extracellular proteoglycan were fit to a three-compartment model. A t1/2 of 98 +/- 7 min for the loss of core protein precursor from the rough microsomes and a t1/2 = 10 +/- 4 min for the completed proteoglycan in the intracellular compartment (Golgi and secretory vesicles) was obtained. The data indicate that at least 70% of the intracellular transit time for the core protein precursor is spent in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The addition of glycosaminoglycan chains followed by secretion from the cell occurs relatively rapidly, occupying less than 30% of the total intracellular dwell time."

https://openalex.org/W1637674369,"The dehydrogenase activity of the mitochondrial isozyme (E2) of human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase was stimulated about 2-fold by the presence of low concentrations (about 120-140 microM) of Mg2+ in the assay at pH 7.0 using propionaldehyde as substrate. The stimulation was totally reversible by treatment with EDTA. Maximum stimulation was dependent on the concentration of NAD+ used in the assay; an increase in Km value of NAD+ was observed to parallel the increase in maximal velocity with increasing Mg2+ concentration, indicating that alterations in the catalytic properties of the E2 isozyme occur in the presence of Mg2+. The presteady state burst of NADH product was observed to decrease in the presence of Mg2+, suggesting that the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenase reaction is altered by Mg2+. No evidence for Mg2+-induced alterations in the molecular weight properties of the E2 isozyme was observed using gel filtration column chromatography and fluorescence polarization techniques. In addition, no alterations in the inactivating properties of iodoacetamide or disulfiram were produced by Mg2+. These results suggest that the mechanism by which human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (E2) is stimulated by Mg2+ is different from that of the horse enzyme, representing a significant species difference."
https://openalex.org/W1488962006,"Three independently isolated mutants of Escherichia coli which apparently lacked protein L19 on their ribosomes, as judged by two-dimensional gels, were analyzed by a range of immunological tests to determine if the protein was indeed lacking. In two of the three, all the tests indicated that protein L19 was absent from both ribosome and supernatant. In the third, a drastically altered form of protein L19 was present on the ribosome. Electron micrographs of ribosomes obtained from the mutants were indistinguishable from those of wild type strains. The location of ribosomal protein L19 on the surface of the large subunit was determined. It was situated at the base of the 50 S particle facing the small subunit, on the side where the rod like appendage originates."

The spectrum was well resolved and highly characteristic of the chromophore. Comparisons were made between the spectrum of this modified DNA and the isolated deoxyguanosine-BPDE adduct and a series of other 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-BP (THBP) derivatives. 9-Hydroxy-BP 4,5-oxide, which is also involved in the binding of BP to DNA, and THBP have very similar conventional broadband fluorescence spectra. However, the fluorescence-line-narrowed spectra of their derivatives were readily distinguishable either as individual components or as mixtures."
https://openalex.org/W1550793261,"The role of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in the catalytic mechanism of glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1) remains unresolved despite extensive investigation. A previous report from this laboratory (Takagi, M., Fukui, T., and Shimomura, S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 3716-3719) provided evidence for the direct interaction between the two phosphate groups of the coenzyme and a substrate alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate. When apophosphorylase is reconstituted with pyridoxal (5')-diphospho(1)-alpha-D-glucose, the enzyme can transfer the glucose moiety to glycogen just as in the normal catalysis. We have studied the kinetics of the glucosyltransfer from this compound to glycogen. The normal and mimic reactions were similar in their kinetic parameters for glycogen and AMP and their activation energies. AMP and other nucleotides that activate the normal reaction could activate the mimic reaction as well. The log k/pH plot for the mimic reaction gave a bell-shaped curve with pKa = 6.90 and pKb = 8.84 at 25 degrees C. The apparent heats of ionization of the corresponding groups having the pKa and pKb were 6.9 and 3.0 kcal/mol, respectively. Reversibility of the glucosyltransfer from the coenzyme-substrate conjugate to glycogen could not be demonstrated, possibly because the equilibrium of this reaction lies further to the polysaccharide synthesis. Based on these and other data which confirm the role of the phosphate group of the coenzyme as an electrophile, we discuss the catalytic mechanism of glycogen phosphorylase. It is suggested that the imidazoyl group of His-376 acts as a nucleophile attacking the anomeric carbon of the substrate glucose 1-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1527548870,"A purine nucleotide (inosinate) cycle is demonstrated with human lymphoblasts. The lymphoblast requires approximately 50 nmol of purine/10(6) cell increment. When the inosinate cycle is interrupted by the genetic, severe deficiency of either or both purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), purine accumulates in the culture medium as inosine, guanosine, deoxyinosine, and deoxyguanosine (PNP deficiency or PNP, HPRT deficiency) or hypoxanthine and guanine (HPRT deficiency). This accumulation represents an additional 25 to 32 nmol of purine which must be synthesized per 10(6) cell increment. PNP-deficient lymphoblasts have PPRibP contents characteristic of normal lymphoblasts, about 20 to 25 pmol/10(6) cells. HPRT-deficient lymphoblasts have four times higher PPRibP contents. The lymphoblast deficient for both PNP and HPRT has only a marginal elevation of PPRibP content, 1.5 times normal values. The elevated PPRibP content of HPRT-deficient cells reflects the efficient, unilateral reutilization of the ribose moiety of purine ribonucleotides and is not a cause of purine overproduction. Purine overproduction characterizing PNP-deficient lymphoblasts appears similar to overproduction from deficiency of HPRT, i.e. a break in the inosinate cycle rather than overactive de novo purine synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1548525704,"Twelve-day-old embryonic chick mandibles were cultured in vitro for 6 days. Measurements of the weights of the explants, their mineral and protein components, and the EDTA-extractable proteins established that bone tissue synthesizes O-phosphoserine- and O-phosphothreonine-containing phosphoproteins which are similar to those present in embryonic and postnatal chicken bone matrix. The synthesis of the phosphoproteins was further confirmed by the demonstration that radioactively labeled O-phosphoserine and O-phosphothreonine were identified in bone and in the EDTA-extractable phosphoproteins after pulse-labeling chick mandibles in vitro with radioactively labeled serine and threonine, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1600415112,"The control of phosphorylase levels was investigated in rat skeletal muscle cells developing in vitro. The amount of enzyme was directly measured after immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. The rate of phosphorylase synthesis was estimated by measuring the initial rate of formation of [3H]phosphorylase after incubating cells with [3H]tyrosine. Rates of degradation were determined either from pulse-chase experiments using [3H]tyrosine or by the loss of enzymatic activity following inhibition of protein synthesis. A large increase in phosphorylase occurred at the time myoblasts were fusing into myotubes. The accumulation of enzyme was preceded by a marked increase in the synthetic rate and was associated with a severalfold increase in the half-life of the enzyme. Following fusion, the myotubes began to spontaneously contract, and shortly thereafter, decreases in both the half-life and amount of phosphorylase were observed. The paralytic agents tetrodotoxin and lidocaine were without effect on phosphorylase levels before the onset of spontaneous activity; however, both agents increased the amount of enzyme when added to contracting myotubes. Tetrodotoxin had little effect on synthesis of [3H]phosphorylase but doubled the half-life of the enzyme. These and other results indicate that the increase in phosphorylase in differentiating muscle cells results from the coordinate control of both its synthesis and degradation, and that muscle activity decreases phosphorylase by increasing its degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1517408894,"Small angle neutron scattering of both activated and deactivated hexadecameric ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from spinach revealed that its structure in solution very closely resembles that determined for the deactivated crystalline enzyme from tobacco (Baker, T.S., Eisenberg, D., and Eiserling, F. (1977) Science 196, 293-295). Scattering from both forms of the enzyme in H2O most closely fits that expected from a hollow sphere with an outer radius of 56.4 A and inner radius of 14.3 A. In D2O the enzyme's scattering profiles more closely resembled those of a hollow cylinder with an axial ratio of approximately 1.06 and outer and inner radii of 46.7 and 12.9 A, respectively. Superpositioning of model structures showed that both models determined by neutron scattering correspond quite well to that inferred from x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy of the tobacco enzyme. Sedimentation velocity studies confirmed that no major conformational change occurs upon activation of the spinch carboxylase, both forms exhibiting a sedimentation coefficient, 8(20,w), of 17.8 S. Neutron scattering by activated and deactivated carboxylase from Rhodospirillum rubrum, a dimeric enzyme, best matched that predicted for a solid prolate ellipsoid or cylinder. The estimated dimensions of the model structures correspond strikingly well to those predicted for adjacent pairs of large subunits in the hexadecameric tobacco enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1517794943,"Alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli contains three metal binding sites (A, B, and C) located at sites forming a triangle with sides of 4, 5, and 7 A (Wyckoff, H.W., Handschumacher, M., Murthy, K., and Sowadski, J.M. (1983) Adv. Enzymol. 55, 453). When all three sites are occupied by Cd(II) the enzyme has a very low turnover; at least 10(3) slower than the native Zn(II) enzyme. The slow turnover number has made the Cd(II) enzyme useful in NMR studies of the mechanism of alkaline phosphatase. The binding of arsenate to two forms of Cd(II) alkaline phosphatase (Cd(II)2alkaline phosphatase and Cd(II)6alkaline phosphatase) has been studied by 113Cd NMR. Cd(II)2alkaline phosphatase, pH 6.3, binds arsenate at only one monomer of the dimeric enzyme and causes migration of Cd(II) from the A site of one monomer to the B site of the arsenylated monomer. This same migration has previously been observed to accompany metal ion-dependent phosphate binding, but is much more rapid in the case of arsenate. The acceleration of migration induced by arsenate supports the conclusion based on the phosphate data that the substrate anion binds to the A site metal ion of one monomer prior to migration and that only the metal ion at A site is required for phosphorylation (arsenylation) of serine 102. The 113Cd chemical shifts of A and B site metal ions are very sensitive to the form of the bound arsenate, i.e. covalent (E-As) or noncovalent (E X As) complex. Like the analogous phosphate derivatives, the change of chemical shift of A site (to which phosphate is coordinated in the E X P complex) is much greater than that of the B site metal ion, when the arsenate shifts between the two intermediates, suggesting that arsenate is also coordinated to A site in the E X As intermediate. The chemical shifts of A and B site 113Cd(II) ions are considerably different in the arsenate and phosphate derivatives, while the C site 113Cd(II) ions have nearly identical chemical shifts. Thus the substrate appears to interact closely with both A and B sites, while C site appears relatively unimportant in phosphomonoester hydrolysis. The analogous behavior of arsenate and phosphate at the active center as evaluated by 113Cd NMR supports the validity of using the heavier arsenate derivative in x-ray diffraction studies."
https://openalex.org/W1587215248,"Aphidicolin, a fungal metabolite which is a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, inhibited the incorporation of [14C]acetate into desmosterol in mouse L cells by 50% at a concentration of 8.8 microM. It had no effect on acetate metabolism into fatty acids or CO2. The site of inhibition was determined to be distal to the formation of mevalonic acid since aphidicolin also inhibited the incorporation of [14C]mevalonolactone into desmosterol but had no effect on the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) or the incorporation of [14C]acetate into total nonsaponifiable lipids. High pressure liquid chromotographic analysis of the distribution of radioactivity among the nonsaponifiable lipids formed from [14C]acetate in the presence of aphidicolin indicated an accumulation of lanosterol accompanied by a proportional decrease in radiolabeled desmosterol and two of its precursors, delta 5,7,24-cholestatrienol, and 4 alpha-methyl-delta 8,24-cholestadienol. In cells exposed to aphidicolin, lanosterol accumulation was rapid (15 min) and reversible after a 3-h exposure when cells were rinsed and fresh medium added. It was concluded that aphidicolin inhibits the conversion of lanosterol to C-27 sterols. Although the exact mechanism of this inhibition has not yet been determined, addition of aphidicolin to 20,000 X g supernatant fractions of mouse liver homogenates inhibited the incorporation of [14C]mevalonolactone into cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that aphidicolin may act directly on one or more of the enzymatic steps involved in lanosterol demethylation. The ubiquitous occurrence of an aphidicolin binding site on eukaryotic DNA alpha polymerases and the inhibitory action of aphidicolin at a proposed secondary regulatory site in sterol biosynthesis (lanosterol metabolism) suggest that a naturally occurring compound may exist which can regulate both DNA replication and cholesterogenesis."
