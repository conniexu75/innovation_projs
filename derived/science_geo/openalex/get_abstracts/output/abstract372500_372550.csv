https://openalex.org/W2034469841,"TGF-beta and BMP receptor kinases activate Smad transcription factors by C-terminal phosphorylation. We have identified a subsequent agonist-induced phosphorylation that plays a central dual role in Smad transcriptional activation and turnover. As receptor-activated Smads form transcriptional complexes, they are phosphorylated at an interdomain linker region by CDK8 and CDK9, which are components of transcriptional mediator and elongation complexes. These phosphorylations promote Smad transcriptional action, which in the case of Smad1 is mediated by the recruitment of YAP to the phosphorylated linker sites. An effector of the highly conserved Hippo organ size control pathway, YAP supports Smad1-dependent transcription and is required for BMP suppression of neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. The phosphorylated linker is ultimately recognized by specific ubiquitin ligases, leading to proteasome-mediated turnover of activated Smad proteins. Thus, nuclear CDK8/9 drive a cycle of Smad utilization and disposal that is an integral part of canonical BMP and TGF-beta pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1993476794,"Acquired memory initially depends on the hippocampus (HPC) for the process of cortical permanent memory formation. The mechanisms through which memory becomes progressively independent from the HPC remain unknown. In the HPC, adult neurogenesis has been described in many mammalian species, even at old ages. Using two mouse models in which hippocampal neurogenesis is physically or genetically suppressed, we show that decreased neurogenesis is accompanied by a prolonged HPC-dependent period of associative fear memory. Inversely, enhanced neurogenesis by voluntary exercise sped up the decay rate of HPC dependency of memory, without loss of memory. Consistently, decreased neurogenesis facilitated the long-lasting maintenance of rat hippocampal long-term potentiation in vivo. These independent lines of evidence strongly suggest that the level of hippocampal neurogenesis play a role in determination of the HPC-dependent period of memory in adult rodents. These observations provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of the hippocampal-cortical complementary learning systems."
https://openalex.org/W2113108919,"Riboswitches are RNA elements acting in cis, controlling expression of their downstream genes through a metabolite-induced alteration of their secondary structure. Here, we demonstrate that two S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) riboswitches, SreA and SreB, can also function in trans and act as noncoding RNAs in Listeria monocytogenes. SreA and SreB control expression of the virulence regulator PrfA by binding to the 5'-untranslated region of its mRNA. Absence of the SAM riboswitches SreA and SreB increases the level of PrfA and virulence gene expression in L. monocytogenes. Thus, the impact of the SAM riboswitches on PrfA expression highlights a link between bacterial virulence and nutrient availability. Together, our results uncover an unexpected role for riboswitches and a distinct class of regulatory noncoding RNAs in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1992267971,"During meiosis, each chromosome must pair with its unique homologous partner, a process that usually culminates with the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, special regions on each chromosome known as pairing centers are essential for both homologous pairing and synapsis. We report that during early meiosis, pairing centers establish transient connections to the cytoplasmic microtubule network. These connections through the intact nuclear envelope require the SUN/KASH domain protein pair SUN-1 and ZYG-12. Disruption of microtubules inhibits chromosome pairing, indicating that these connections promote interhomolog interactions. Dynein activity is essential to license formation of the SC once pairing has been accomplished, most likely by overcoming a barrier imposed by the chromosome-nuclear envelope connection. Our findings thus provide insight into how homolog pairing is accomplished in meiosis and into the mechanisms regulating synapsis so that it occurs selectively between homologs. For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file with the Supplemental Data available online."
https://openalex.org/W2114577844,"ClpX is a AAA+ machine that uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to unfold native proteins and translocate unfolded polypeptides into the ClpP peptidase. The crystal structures presented here reveal striking asymmetry in ring hexamers of nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound ClpX. Asymmetry arises from large changes in rotation between the large and small AAA+ domains of individual subunits. These differences prevent nucleotide binding to two subunits, generate a staggered arrangement of ClpX subunits and pore loops around the hexameric ring, and provide a mechanism for coupling conformational changes caused by ATP binding or hydrolysis in one subunit to flexing motions of the entire ring. Our structures explain numerous solution studies of ClpX function, predict mechanisms for pore elasticity during translocation of irregular polypeptides, and suggest how repetitive conformational changes might be coupled to mechanical work during the ATPase cycle of ClpX and related molecular machines."
https://openalex.org/W2000218608,"Mature HIV-1 particles contain conical-shaped capsids that enclose the viral RNA genome and perform essential functions in the virus life cycle. Previous structural analysis of two- and three-dimensional arrays of the capsid protein (CA) hexamer revealed three interfaces. Here, we present a cryoEM study of a tubular assembly of CA and a high-resolution NMR structure of the CA C-terminal domain (CTD) dimer. In the solution dimer structure, the monomers exhibit different relative orientations compared to previous X-ray structures. The solution structure fits well into the EM density map, suggesting that the dimer interface is retained in the assembled CA. We also identified a CTD-CTD interface at the local three-fold axis in the cryoEM map and confirmed its functional importance by mutagenesis. In the tubular assembly, CA intermolecular interfaces vary slightly, accommodating the asymmetry present in tubes. This provides the necessary plasticity to allow for controlled virus capsid dis/assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2042546293,"We examined context-dependent encoding of speech in children with and without developmental dyslexia by measuring auditory brainstem responses to a speech syllable presented in a repetitive or variable context. Typically developing children showed enhanced brainstem representation of features related to voice pitch in the repetitive context, relative to the variable context. In contrast, children with developmental dyslexia exhibited impairment in their ability to modify representation in predictable contexts. From a functional perspective, we found that the extent of context-dependent encoding in the auditory brainstem correlated positively with behavioral indices of speech perception in noise. The ability to sharpen representation of repeating elements is crucial to speech perception in noise, since it allows superior “tagging” of voice pitch, an important cue for segregating sound streams in background noise. The disruption of this mechanism contributes to a critical deficit in noise-exclusion, a hallmark symptom in developmental dyslexia.

The disruption of this mechanism contributes to a critical deficit in noise-exclusion, a hallmark symptom in developmental dyslexia. Verbal communication often occurs in noisy backgrounds. Imagine a conversation with a friend in a noisy restaurant. To effectively converse with your friend you need to extract the information that he/she conveys from the irrelevant background noise. This task is particularly challenging because the competing noise (other talkers) has acoustic properties that overlap with the target signal (your friend's voice). Yet, for the most part, communication is unimpeded even under such challenging conditions. This remarkable feat relies on a highly adaptive auditory system that continually modulates its activity based on contextual demands. Successful completion of this complex task, extracting the speech signal, takes advantage of a predictable, repeating element (the pitch of your friend's voice) amid the random, fluctuating background of many voices. The ability to “tag” the predictable elements in the environment (e.g., voice pitch) provides significant benefits to perception under adverse listening conditions (Bregman, 1994Bregman A.S.

How the nervous system functionally adapts and fine-tunes the representation of predictable auditory elements in the environment is currently unknown. Understanding the relationship between the adaptive auditory system and perception of speech in noise is clinically relevant because recent studies have demonstrated that children with developmental dyslexia are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of background noise (Sperling et al., 2005Sperling A.J.

Speech-perception-in-noise deficits in dyslexia.Developmental Sci. 2009; 12: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Developmental dyslexia is a neurological disorder affecting reading and spelling skills in approximately 5%–10% of school-aged children (Demonet et al., 2004Demonet J.F. Taylor M.J. Chaix Y. Developmental dyslexia.Lancet. 2004; 363: 1451-1460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A “core deficit” identified in these children is noise-exclusion, i.e., an inability to exclude noise from ongoing perceptual dynamics (Ahissar, 2007Ahissar M.

Lorenzi C. Speech-perception-in-noise deficits in dyslexia.Developmental Sci. 2009; 12: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Behavioral studies have posited that noise-exclusion issues may be attributed to a neural impairment in extracting regularities (e.g., extracting a speaker's voice in the midst of background noise) from the incoming sensory stream (Ahissar et al., 2006Ahissar M. Lubin Y. Putter-Katz H. Banai K. Dyslexia and the failure to form a perceptual anchor.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although the neural bases of such context-dependent encoding are unknown, it has been argued that lower perceptual structures play an important role in automatically fine-tuning responses to repeating elements in the incoming sensory stream (Ahissar, 2007Ahissar M. Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2007; 11: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recent studies in animal models have argued that lower perceptual structures (i.e., auditory brainstem) are crucial for processing auditory signals in noisy environments (Luo et al., 2008Luo F. Wang Q. Kashani A. Yan J. Corticofugal modulation of initial sound processing in the brain.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11615-11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Auditory processing in lower perceptual structures involves an interplay between sensory and cognitive systems mediated by feedforward and feedback pathways (Tzounopoulos and Kraus, 2009Tzounopoulos T. Kraus N. Learning to encode timing: mechanisms of plasticity in the auditory brainstem.Neuron. 2009; 62: 463-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The massive efferent connections from the cortex to subcortical structures form the basis for such feedback-related top-down control (Winer, 2005Winer J.A. Decoding the auditory corticofugal systems.Hear. Res. 2005; 207: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the functional role of these efferent connections is currently unknown, a recent study has hypothesized that corticofugal feedback may provide significant benefits in noisy environments by selectively amplifying relevant information in the signal, and inhibiting irrelevant information at the earliest stages of auditory processing (Luo et al., 2008Luo F. Wang Q. Kashani A. Yan J. Corticofugal modulation of initial sound processing in the brain.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11615-11621Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In humans, the neural transcription of complex auditory stimuli such as speech can be measured noninvasively from lower levels of the central nervous system such as the auditory brainstem (Johnson et al., 2008Johnson K.L.

Skoe E. Nicol T. Zecker S. Kraus N. Subcortical differentiation of stop consonants relates to reading and speech-in-noise perception.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Learning to encode timing: mechanisms of plasticity in the auditory brainstem.Neuron. 2009; 62: 463-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The auditory brainstem response faithfully preserves the complex harmonic characteristics of speech (Kraus and Nicol, 2005Kraus N. Nicol T. Brainstem origins for cortical “what” and “where” pathways in the auditory system.Trends in Neurosci. 2005; 28: 176-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Most speech sounds have a complex harmonic structure that relates to the source (vocal fold vibration) and filter (vocal tract characteristics). For example, in producing a vowel, a speaker causes his/her vocal folds (the source) to vibrate. This causes a glottal pulse, a periodic buzz-like sound made up of a fundamental frequency (F0) and integer multiples of that fundamental frequency (harmonics). The glottal pulses are shaped by the vocal tract (e.g., the tongue position in the oral cavity), and depending on the vowel, certain harmonics are boosted, resulting in a signature spectrum. These boosted harmonics are referred to as “formants” (e.g., F1, F2, F3, etc.). The fundamental frequency (F0) and the lower-numbered harmonics strongly relate to voice pitch (e.g., is the speaker male or female?), while the formant structure relates to speech identification (e.g., is the vowel /i/ or /a/?). Neural representation of both components (voice pitch, formant structure) is necessary for speech-in-noise perception. The voice pitch allows tagging of the speaker in noise; the formant structure is needed to discern the content of speech. The frequency following response (FFR), a component of the auditory brainstem response, reflects neural phase-locking to F0 and its harmonics (Chandrasekaran and Kraus, 2009Chandrasekaran B. Kraus N. The scalp-recorded auditory brainstem response to speech: neural origins and plasticity.Psychophysiology. 2009; (in press. Published online October 12, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.2009.00928.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The FFR closely mimics the incoming signal; when the FFR waveform, recorded in response to words, is played back, subjects can identify the words with greater-than-chance accuracy (Galbraith et al., 1995Galbraith G.C. Arbagey P.W. Branski R. Comerci N. Rector P.M. Intelligible speech encoded in the human brain stem frequency-following response.Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2363-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that the FFR can serve as an index of long-term and training-related plasticity. Native speakers of a tone language, in which changes to voice pitch alone can change word meaning, represent voice pitch more robustly than nonnative speakers (Krishnan and Gandour, 2009Krishnan A. Gandour J.T. The role of the auditory brainstem in processing linguistically-relevant pitch patterns.Brain Lang. 2009; 110: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Krishnan et al., 2005Krishnan A. Xu Y. Gandour J. Cariani P. Encoding of pitch in the human brainstem is sensitive to language experience.Cogn. Brain Res. 2005; 25: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Similarly, musicians, who have long-term experience with musical pitch, show superior representation of voice pitch at the level of the brainstem, suggesting that plasticity is not specific to the domain of expertise (Musacchia et al., 2007Musacchia G. Sams M. Skoe E. Kraus N. Musicians have enhanced subcortical auditory and audiovisual processing of speech and music.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15894-15898Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, Wong et al., 2007Wong P.C. Skoe E. Russo N.M. Dees T. Kraus N. Musical experience shapes human brainstem encoding of linguistic pitch patterns.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 420-422PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, studies examining neural plasticity at the level of the brainstem have used two groups, a proficient group (e.g., musicians) and a control group (e.g., Krishnan et al., 2005Krishnan A. Xu Y. Gandour J. Cariani P. Encoding of pitch in the human brainstem is sensitive to language experience.Cogn. Brain Res. 2005; 25: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, Krishnan et al., 2009Krishnan A. Swaminathan J. Gandour J.T. Experience-dependent Enhancement of Linguistic Pitch Representation in the Brainstem Is Not Specific to a Speech Context.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2009; 21: 1092-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Musacchia et al., 2007Musacchia G. Sams M. Skoe E. Kraus N. Musicians have enhanced subcortical auditory and audiovisual processing of speech and music.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15894-15898Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, Wong et al., 2007Wong P.C. Skoe E. Russo N.M. Dees T. Kraus N. Musical experience shapes human brainstem encoding of linguistic pitch patterns.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 420-422PubMed Google Scholar). The general conclusions from these studies have been that processing in the human auditory brainstem is dynamic in nature. While it is generally agreed that the auditory brainstem is sensitive to auditory experience, the exact mechanism by which auditory experience modulates activity is as yet undetermined. An important issue is the extent to which plasticity is operational online (i.e., shows sensitivity to ongoing contextual demands) or reflects long-term structural and functional reorganization. Do we continuously fine-tune or shape our representation with repetition? Or does plasticity reflect a longer timescale that requires an extensive local reorganization of circuitry to better encode biologically relevant sounds? In the current study we examine whether auditory brainstem responses can indeed be modulated online by context. To test this proposal we created a brainstem recording procedure that averages across responses to repetitive auditory stimulation. In Experiment 1 we examine context-dependent encoding by comparing auditory brainstem responses to a synthesized speech syllable, /da/, elicited in two different contexts: a predictable context versus a highly variable context. By matching trials between the two contexts (see Figure 1), we are able to examine differences in brainstem responses to the same stimulus under two different contexts, without a presentation order confound. Next, we examine whether the ability to fine-tune or sharpen brainstem responses to speech features online is functionally related to speech-in-noise perception in children. In Experiment 2, we examine context-dependent brainstem modulation in children with developmental dyslexia, a clinical group that is shown to have global deficits in repetition-induced sensory fine-tuning (Ahissar, 2007Ahissar M. Dyslexia and the anchoring-deficit hypothesis.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2007; 11: 458-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) as well as noise-exclusion (Sperling et al., 2005Sperling A.J. Lu Z.L. Manis F.R. Seidenberg M.S. Deficits in perceptual noise exclusion in developmental dyslexia.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 862-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In Experiment 1, we examined context-dependent brainstem encoding of speech in 21 typically developing children. Context-dependent effects were observed in the 7–60 ms time range of the response, which encompasses the response to the sound onset and the consonant-vowel formant transition period (Figure 2A), but not in the 60–180 ms time range that encompasses the response to the steady-state vowel. Spectral amplitudes of the lower harmonics (H2, H4), which lead to the perception of pitch, were enhanced in the repetitive context relative to the variable context (Figure 2B). No significant context effects were found for any of the latency (Figure S1 and Table S4 available online) or amplitude (Figure 2A) measures, suggesting that stimulus context does not modulate these measures. Within the spectral domain, multivariate repeated-measures ANOVAs (RmANOVAs) conducted on the average response magnitudes of the F0 and subsequent five harmonics yielded significant differences between the repetitive context and variable context conditions for the second (H2) and fourth (H4) harmonics during the formant transition region only (7–60 ms). Relative to the variable context, H2 and H4 amplitudes were significantly larger in the repetitive context [F(1,18) = 13.952, p = 0.002; F(1,18) = 4.758, p = 0.043, respectively]. Figure 2B shows the grand averaged response spectrum for the 7–60 ms range and these differences are highlighted as bar charts. There was no significant effect of context for F0 or any harmonic amplitude for the steady-state vowel portion (60–180 ms), indicating that context-dependent effects only occur in response to the complex, time-varying portion of the stimulus, which is crucial for distinguishing speech sounds. Additionally, over the frequency region of interest included in the first formant range (400–720 Hz), the repetitive context elicited stronger spectral representations between 530–590 Hz than the variable context in the 7–60 ms time region [t(20) = 4.217, p < 0.001; see Figure S3], but not in the 60–180 ms time region [t(20) = 0.428, p = 0.673; see Figure S3]. To investigate the relationship between the extent of context-dependent brainstem encoding and behavioral indices of speech-in-noise perception, a series of Pearson's correlations were calculated. We evaluated the degree of brainstem dynamicity by computing the difference in spectral amplitudes (H2, H4) between the two conditions (repetitive context minus variable context) for each participant. These values were then converted to z-scores with larger positive values indicating enhanced encoding in the repetitive context relative to the variable context. The z-scored H2 and H4 spectral amplitude differences were correlated with behavioral performance in Hearing in Noise Test (HINT), a standardized test of speech perception in noise (see Figure 2C) administered to the children. H2 difference scores correlated positively with HINT-RIGHT (noise source located to the right of the listener) percentile score (r = 0.518, p = 0.016) and HINT-COMPOSITE (composite of three noise conditions) (r = 0.486, p = 0.025), and to a lesser degree with HINT-FRONT (noise source located in front of the listener) (r = 0.407, p = .067), but not with HINT-LEFT (r = 0.066, p = 0.777). No significant correlations were found between H4 difference and speech-in-noise perception (see Supplemental Results section). In Experiment 2, we examined context-dependent brainstem encoding of speech in children with good and poor reading skills (n = 15, both groups). Children with poor reading skills differed in the extent and nature of context-dependent spectral encoding within the 7–60 ms time period corresponding to the stimulus formant transition, but not during the 60–180 ms time period corresponding to the steady-state vowel. Multivariate RmANOVAs revealed significant interactions between context (repetitive, variable) and group (good readers, poor readers) for H2 amplitude [F(1,28) = 17.099, p < 0.001], H4 amplitude [F(1,28) = 11.649, p = 0.002] (Figure 3), and the F1 range [F(1,28) = 6.827, p = 0.014; see Figure S4] in the formant transition region only (7–60 ms). Consistent with Experiment 1, post hoc paired t tests showed larger H2 and H4 amplitudes in the repetitive context than the variable context for good readers [t(14) = 5.156, p < 0.001; t(14) = 2.805, p < 0.05, respectively, Figures 3B and 4]. Also, in the F1 range, good readers showed larger spectral amplitude in the repetitive context relative to the variable context [t(14) = 3.749, p = 0.002, Figure S2]. In contrast, poor readers showed no significant differences between the two conditions (Figures 3B and 4), although a trend for H2 and H4 amplitudes to be greater for the variable context relative to the repetitive context was present [H2: t(14) = −1.773, p = 0.098; H4: t(14) = −2.095, p = 0.055]. Additionally, for poor readers, no significant differences were observed between the two contexts in the spectral amplitude within the F1 range (Figure S4). Additional post hoc independent t tests revealed larger H2 spectral amplitude for good readers relative to poor readers in the repetitive context [t(28) = −2.643, p = 0.013]. In contrast, in the variable context, poor readers showed greater H2 spectral amplitude relative to good readers [t(28) = 3.116, p = 0.004]. Consistent with Experiment 1, there were no main effects of context, main effects of group, or interactions between group and context within the steady-state vowel portion (60–180 ms).Figure 4Experiment 2: Good Readers Show Superior Encoding in the Repetitive Context While the Opposite Pattern Is Seen in Poor ReadersShow full captionGood readers (left) have greater H2 and H4 amplitudes (200 and 400 Hz, respectively) in the repetitive condition than they do in the variable condition (signified by warm colors), while the poor readers (right) show greater H2 and H4 amplitudes in the variable condition than they do in the repetitive condition (signified by cool colors).

Figures were created by first generating response spectrograms for both conditions, and then subtracting spectral amplitudes elicited in the variable context condition from those elicited in the repetitive condition for each group. Similar to Experiment 1, which was restricted to normal readers, the difference in H2 encoding between the two contexts in Experiment 2 was also correlated with speech-in-noise perception in this broader group containing both good and poor readers. H2 difference was correlated with HINT-RIGHT (r = 0.349, p = 0.058, Figure 3D), HINT-COMPOSITE (r = 0.436, p = 0.016, Figure 3C), and HINT-FRONT (r = 0.365, p = 0.048), but not HINT-LEFT (r = 0.082, p = 0.666). These effects are maintained when controlling for verbal IQ (r = 0.320, p = 0.091; r = 0.344, p = 0.067; r = 0.419, p = 0.024, respectively). In addition, H2 difference scores were also significantly correlated with performance on a number of behavioral indices of reading ability (Table S2), although these effects were not maintained when verbal IQ was partialled out. Our electrophysiological results provide the first evidence that the human auditory brainstem is sensitive to ongoing stimulus context. Stimulus repetition induces online plasticity that leads to an automatic sharpening of brainstem representation of speech cues related to voice pitch. This repetition-induced neural fine-tuning is strongly associated with perception of speech in noise, suggesting that this type of plasticity is indeed functional. The ability to modulate or sharpen the neural representation of voice pitch is crucial to speech perception in noise. This is because voice pitch is a critical cue in speaker identification and allows enhanced tagging of the speaker's voice, an important mechanism for segregating sound streams in background noise (Bregman, 1994Bregman A.S.

In a second experiment comparing good and poor readers, we find that brainstem encoding among poor readers is impaired and does not adapt as well to the repeating elements of the auditory signal. Poor readers also show a deficit in perceiving speech in noise, confirming previous studies that report noise-exclusion dysfunction in other sensory domains (Ziegler et al., 2009Ziegler J.C.

In Experiment 1 we examined the effect of stimulus context on the auditory brainstem response to speech in typically developing children. Our data demonstrate that in the predictable context (relative to the variable context), representation of harmonic stimulus features that contribute to encoding voice pitch was enhanced within the time-varying period of the response (7–60 ms), a period corresponding to the transition from the consonant to the vowel. This suggests that the human auditory brainstem is indeed modulated by short-term stimulus history. How do these findings relate to current knowledge about the functioning of the human auditory brainstem? Studies have demonstrated experience-dependent modulation of the encoding of voice pitch (Krishnan et al., 2005Krishnan A. Xu Y. Gandour J. Cariani P.

Long-term experience with a tone language can improve the representation of native pitch contours (Krishnan and Gandour, 2009Krishnan A. Gandour J.T. The role of the auditory brainstem in processing linguistically-relevant pitch patterns.Brain Lang. 2009; 110: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). While these studies have demonstrated that the auditory brainstem encoding is dynamic in nature, and reflects long-term auditory experience, the neurobiological mechanism that contributes to this plasticity has remained elusive. Two hypotheses on the nature of experience-dependent brainstem plasticity are being debated (Krishnan and Gandour, 2009Krishnan A. Gandour J.T. The role of the auditory brainstem in processing linguistically-relevant pitch patterns.Brain Lang. 2009; 110: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The corticofugal model states that top-down feedback via the corticofugal efferent network modifies brainstem function (Suga, 2008Suga N. Role of corticofugal feedback in hearing.J. Comp. Physiol. A.

Tubulogenesis often coincides with cell-lineage specification during organ development. Hence, an elementary question is whether these two processes are independently controlled, or whether proper cell specification depends on formation of tubes. To address these fundamental questions, we have studied the functional role of Cdc42 in pancreatic tubulogenesis. We present evidence that Cdc42 is essential for tube formation, specifically for initiating microlumen formation and later for maintaining apical cell polarity. Finally, we show that Cdc42 controls cell specification non-cell-autonomously by providing the correct microenvironment for proper control of cell-fate choices of multipotent progenitors.For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file with the Supplemental Data available online.

For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file with the Supplemental Data available online. Organs such as the lung, kidney, pancreas, salivary gland, and mammary gland are primarily made up of tubes that act as biological pipes for transporting vital fluids and gases. Two principle mechanisms for mammalian tubulogenesis have been described. One mechanism involves reiterative sprouting and stereotypical branching of a tubular anlagen consisting of fully polarized epithelial cells. This process has for example been described in the lung (Metzger et al., 2008Metzger R.J. Klein O.D. Martin G.R. Krasnow M.A. The branching programme of mouse lung development.Nature. 2008; 453: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The other mechanism is represented in glandular organs, e.g., the pancreas, mammary gland, prostate, and salivary glands, where tubulogenesis arises when groups of unpolarized epithelial cells form microlumens, which subsequently participate in the formation of tubes where branching is not entirely stereotypical (Hogan and Kolodziej, 2002Hogan B.L. Kolodziej P.A. Organogenesis: molecular mechanisms of tubulogenesis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 513-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Whereas the first process is relatively well understood, the latter is not. Tubulogenesis involves a series of dynamic and interdependent cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization, assembly of intercellular junctional complexes, and cell polarization. Rho-GTPases are molecular switches that control such complex processes. For example, Cdc42, which is one of the most studied Rho-GTPase family members, is a master regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell polarity—a function which is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals (Etienne-Manneville, 2004Etienne-Manneville S. Cdc42–the centre of polarity.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Recently, Cdc42 was demonstrated to control lumen formation in three-dimensional (3D) organotypic cultures of MDCK and Caco-2 cells by controlling apical segregation of phosphoinositides and spindle orientation during cell division, respectively (Jaffe et al., 2008Jaffe A.B.

Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007Martin-Belmonte F. Gassama A. Datta A. Yu W. Rescher U. Gerke V. Mostov K. PTEN-mediated apical segregation of phosphoinositides controls epithelial morphogenesis through Cdc42.Cell. 2007; 128: 383-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Whether Cdc42 controls lumen formation in vivo in a similar manner remains unclear. The pancreas is a glandular organ where the tubular network interconnects the acinar cells and enables coordinated transport of digestive enzymes into the duodenum. Organogenesis of the pancreas begins with the evagination of the dorsal and ventral anlagen from the foregut endoderm. In mice, this event starts at embryonic day (E) 8.5. The pancreatic epithelium is in contact with various sources of mesodermally derived tissues whose signals are crucial for pancreatic growth and differentiation (Gittes, 2008Gittes G.K. Developmental biology of the pancreas: A comprehensive review.Dev. Biol. 2008; 326: 4-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1(Pdx1) expressing multipotent pancreatic progenitors give rise to all epithelial cells of the adult pancreas, including duct, acinar, and endocrine cells (Gu et al., 2002Gu G. Dubauskaite J. Melton D.A. Direct evidence for the pancreatic lineage: NGN3+ cells are islet progenitors and are distinct from duct progenitors.Development. 2002; 129: 2447-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have used the mouse pancreas to address two fundamentally important questions in developmental biology, namely the molecular control of mammalian organ asymmetry and tubulogenesis in vivo and the interplay between tube formation and cell-fate decisions during organogenesis. First, we show that tube formation starts at E11.5 by the initiation of scattered microlumens throughout the epithelium. These lumens expand by spreading of cell polarization, and not by sprouting, followed by fusion of lumens and their rearrangement into an interconnected tubular system. Second, by ablating Cdc42 at different time points during pancreas development, we demonstrate that Cdc42 is required for microlumen formation and subsequently for maintenance of a polarized tubular phenotype. Third, the failure to organize pancreatic epithelial progenitors into tubes causes a dramatic upregulation of acinar cell differentiation at the expense of duct and endocrine cell differentiation. Finally, we show that this is non-cell-autonomously caused by changes in epithelial cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. To understand the basis for pancreatic tubulogenesis, we first characterized the establishment of epithelial cell polarity and tube formation during pancreas development. Mucin1 (Muc1) is an O-glycosylated transmembrane protein expressed on the apical surface of many epithelia, including the pancreas (Cano et al., 2004Cano D.A. Murcia N.S. Pazour G.J. Hebrok M. Orpk mouse model of polycystic kidney disease reveals essential role of primary cilia in pancreatic tissue organization.Development. 2004; 131: 3457-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, Muc1 was used as an apical marker, whereas the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin (Ecad) and the basement membrane protein laminin (Lam) were used as lateral and basal markers, respectively (Figures 1A–1E). To image the lumenal system three-dimensionally, whole-mount Muc1 immunofluorescence analysis was carried out (Figures 2A–2F). Except for a stunted opening into the duodenum, the E10.5 dorsal pancreatic bud is multilayered, consisting of epithelial cells that lack apicobasal cell polarity. Furthermore, the epithelium lacks lumenal structures and is surrounded by laminin (Figure 1A). The first sign of lumen formation occurs at E11.5 with the stochastic appearance of microlumens scattered throughout the epithelium (Figures 1B, 2A, and 2D; arrowhead indicates microlumen). The microlumens are made up of clusters of epithelial cells with a common apical surface facing the lumen. Subsequently, the microlumens expand by inducing apical cell polarity in neighboring epithelial cells resulting in a complex network of independently organized lumenal structures (Figures S1A and S1B available online). At E12.5 the lumens coalesce into a complex continuous lumenal network within the multilayered epithelium (Figures 1C, 2B, and 2E). Notably, at this point no tubes have formed. However, between E13.5 and E15.5 the lumenal network remodels and matures into a tubular network, i.e., this is the stage when the first tubes consisting of a monolayered fully polarized epithelium surrounded by a basal lamina forms (Figures 1D, 1E, 2C, 2F, and S2 available online). This process can be visualized by changes in the organization of basal lamina components, including laminin. Whereas laminin is distributed mainly on the periphery of the early pancreatic bud, it covers the entire tubular monolayered epithelium at later time points (Figure S2). Moreover, ultrastructural analysis at E15.5 confirmed the hallmarks of a fully polarized tubular epithelium, including cell-cell junctions and protruding microvilli on the apical surface (Figure 1F).Figure 2Cdc42 Is Essential for Tubulogenesis in the Developing PancreasShow full captionTo characterize tubulogenesis in 3D, pancreases from E11.5– E13.5 were analyzed by whole-mount immunostaining with antibodies against mucin1 (Muc1; green), followed by 3D reconstructions of confocal images.(A–C) In the WT, microlumens appeared stochastically at E11.5 (A).

Scale bars, 50 μm (A–C and A′–C′), 20 μm (D–F). The Par-aPKC complex is regulated by Cdc42 and plays a critical role in cell polarity initiation and maintenance. Binding of Cdc42-GTP activates the Par-aPKC complex and the phosphorylated form of aPKC (p-aPKC) was used as a marker to identify the activated form of aPKC (Wu et al., 2007Wu X. Li S. Chrostek-Grashoff A. Czuchra A. Meyer H. Yurchenco P.D. Brakebusch C. Cdc42 is crucial for the establishment of epithelial polarity during early mammalian development.Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At E11.5, p-aPKC was specifically distributed along the apical surface of microlumens together with characteristic apical markers, including ZO-1, Par6, Muc1, and crumbs3 (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that Cdc42 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in the entire pancreas at all development stages analyzed (Figure S3B). To specifically ablate Cdc42 during pancreas development, floxed Cdc42 mice were intercrossed with Pdx1-cre mice (Gu et al., 2002Gu G. Dubauskaite J. Melton D.A. Direct evidence for the pancreatic lineage: NGN3+ cells are islet progenitors and are distinct from duct progenitors.Development. 2002; 129: 2447-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2006Wu X.

Cdc42 controls progenitor cell differentiation and beta-catenin turnover in skin.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). From here on, Cdc42fl/fl or Cdc42fl/+ mice are referred to as wild-type (WT) mice, whereas Cdc42fl/+; Pdx1-cre and Cdc42fl/fl; Pdx1-cre mice are referred to as Cdc42 het and Cdc42 knockout (KO) mice, respectively. Cdc42 het were indistinguishable from WT controls (data not shown). Analysis of the recombination efficiency of the Pdx1-cre line using the R26R LacZ reporter line demonstrated undetectable recombination at E10.5, whereas approximately 90%–95% of the epithelial cells underwent cre-mediated recombination at E11.5. Consistently, cre efficiently ablated the Cdc42 protein (Figure S3C and S3D). As a consequence the first phenotype was apparent at E11.5. In contrast to the WT epithelium where apical polarity is induced concomitant with microlumen formation, apical membrane proteins, e.g., Muc1, remained intracellular within the Cdc42 KO epithelium (compare Figure 1B with 1B′ and S4A with S4A′). Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) analysis revealed a 2-fold upregulation of Muc1 mRNA expression, which most likely is due to an increased number of Muc1+ cells (Figure S4D). In contrast, E-cadherin and laminin showed normal distribution (Figures 1B′–1E′), suggesting that Cdc42 ablation did not affect the formation of the lateral and basal surfaces. The unpolarized Cdc42 KO epithelia failed to retain its integrity and became fragmented into epithelial cords. Cell proliferation gradually transformed these structures into large cellular aggregates lacking tubular structures (Figures 1C′–E′). Whole-mount immunofluorescence analysis of Muc1 in Cdc42 KO E11.5 to E13.5 pancreas confirmed the lack of tubes as well as the change in Muc1 distribution (Figures 2A′–2C′). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis at E15.5 corroborated the failure to establish tubes (Figure 1F′). Thus, Cdc42 is essential for tubulogenesis in the developing pancreas. Careful examination of microlumen formation revealed that induction of apical cell polarity appears to initially involve only one cell. At E11.5, Muc1 is confined to a distinct vesicular compartment close to the plasma membrane (Figure S4A). This intracellular vesicular compartment may represent the same secretory vesicles delivered to the de novo apical membrane concomitant with formation of primitive cell-cell junctions (Figures S4B and S4C). Importantly, these events are only seen at E11.5. Altogether, these results suggest that microlumens are initiated by one cell that upon a given signal induces targeting of secretory vesicles containing apical membrane proteins to the presumptive apical domain. Shortly thereafter neighboring cells undergo apical polarization resulting in a shared apical domain facing a lumen. In the absence of Cdc42, characteristic apical membrane proteins and membrane-associated proteins, including Muc1, ZO-1, Par6, crumbs3, and cortical F-actin, are primarily confined to lumenal structures within cells (Figures 3A–3C). Careful TEM analysis revealed that these lumens (from here on referred to as “autocellular” lumens) are in fact in direct contact with the cell surface via ZO-1+ and claudin3+, “autocellular” tight junction-like junctions (Figures S1C, S1D, and S5). Intercellular lumens between two cells also form, but less frequently (Figures 3C, and S1E, and S1F). The apical membrane phenotype of both the autocellular and intercellular lumenal surfaces is reinforced by the appearance of microvilli-like structures (Figures S1C–S1F and S1H). Finally, Cdc42 ablation does not affect the intracellular distribution of proteins involved in the general vesicular targeting machinery, such as VAP-A (VAMP-associated protein A) (Figure S4E). Based on these findings, Cdc42 is not required for apical membrane biogenesis or for tight junction formation. However, whether the apical domain and tight junctions in the absence of Cdc42 are fully mature and functional remains to be determined. In summary, Cdc42 is necessary for maintaining an apical surface facing the outside of cells and for establishing multicellular (>2 cells) microlumens with shared apical surfaces. Ablating Cdc42 during the earliest stages of pancreas development failed to address whether Cdc42, in addition to its role in microlumen formation, plays a role in maintaining cell polarity in the tubular epithelium. To address this question, we used a tamoxifen (TM) inducible model (Pdx1-cre ER™ mice) for timed ablation of Cdc42 within the pancreatic epithelium (Gu et al., 2002Gu G. Dubauskaite J. Melton D.A. Direct evidence for the pancreatic lineage: NGN3+ cells are islet progenitors and are distinct from duct progenitors.Development. 2002; 129: 2447-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By intercrossing the R26R LacZ reporter line (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar) with Pdx1-cre ER™ mice, recombined cells became traceable by their expression of beta-galactosidase (βGal). To address the role of Cdc42 in maintenance of tubes, Cdc42fl/+; Pdx1-cre ER™; R26R and Cdc42fl/fl; Pdx1-cre ER™; R26R mice were generated. Cdc42 was ablated by a single tamoxifen pulse at E12.5 followed by analysis at E15.5. Thus, at the time of tamoxifen induction these cells were polarized and confined to the primitive tubular network. This mosaic system (Cdc42fl/fl; Pdx1-cre ER™) resulted in a recombination efficiency of 16% (data not shown), which is not sufficient to block tubulogenesis and alter the overall tissue architecture (Figure S6). In control samples, all βGal+ cells were randomly distributed within tubes as fully polarized epithelial cells with an apical surface enriched with Muc1, claudin3, Par6, and cortical F-actin (Figures 4A–4F). In the mosaic Cdc42 KO model βgal+ cells were found both within and outside the tubular epithelium. However, the few βGal+ Cdc42 KO cells that were found interspersed between WT cells within tubes failed to maintain apical cell polarity, as demonstrated by failure to maintain Muc1, Par6, and cortical F-actin on the apical side (Figures 4A′, 4C′, and 4E′). Furthermore, less claudin3 was found at tight junctions of βGal+ cells (Figures 4F and 4F′). Interestingly, basal polarity as detected by laminin deposition was unaffected (Figures 4G and 4G′). Delaminating βGal+ Cdc42 KO cells clustered into epithelial aggregates without an apical surface (Figures 4B′ and 4D′). Intracellular accumulation of apical markers, such as Muc1, and loss of cortical F-actin were observed (Figures 4B′ and 4D′). Loss of apical polarity resulted in replacement of the apical membrane by lateral membrane, as evidenced by expression of the lateral surface marker, E-cadherin (Figure S7). In conclusion, Cdc42 plays a cell-autonomous role not only in microlumen formation but also in maintenance of apical polarity in fully polarized tubular epithelial cells. QPCR analysis showed that both the aPKCζ and aPKCι isoforms are expressed in the developing pancreas (Figure S4D). The activated form of aPKC, p-aPKC, is expressed on the apical membrane throughout the pancreatic lumens and tubes until E13.5 (Figures S8A–S8D). Ablation of Cdc42 resulted in undetectable levels of p-aPKC within the epithelium from E11.5 onward, whereas expression of p-aPKC within blood vessels was unaffected (Figures S8A′–S8D′). To test the hypothesis that Cdc42 controls microlumen formation through aPKC activation we examined whether blocking aPKC activation would mimic the Cdc42 KO phenotype. For this purpose, we used a two-dimensional (2D) explants culture system that provides a simple and effective way to analyze tubulogenesis in vitro (Percival and Slack, 1999Percival A.C. Slack J.M. Analysis of pancreatic development using a cell lineage label.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Treatment of the explants with the myristoylated substrate of aPKCζ (aPKC-PS) effectively inhibited the activation of aPKC, whereas expression of the protein remained unaffected (Figures S9A and S9B) (Nunbhakdi-Craig et al., 2002Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Machleidt T. Ogris E. Bellotto D. White 3rd, C.L. Sontag E. Protein phosphatase 2A associates with and regulates atypical PKC and the epithelial tight junction complex.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Untreated controls formed a continuous tubular network, whereas Cdc42 KO explants failed to form tubes due to their lack of apical cell polarity (Figure S9C). aPKC-PS-treated WT explants failed to generate a continuous tubular network. Instead, the epithelium remained compact with large aggregates of epithelial cells (Figure S9C). However, in contrast to the intracellular accumulation of Muc1 in the Cdc42 KO epithelial cells, apical cell polarity appeared unaffected in aPKC-PS-treated epithelial aggregates (Figure S9C). These results show that aPKC plays a crucial role in lumen coalescence into a continuous tubular network in vitro. This observation is consistent with the multiple lumen phenotype in the intestine of aPKC mutants in Zebrafish (Horne-Badovinac et al., 2001Horne-Badovinac S. Lin D. Waldron S. Schwarz M. Mbamalu G. Pawson T. Jan Y. Stainier D.Y. Abdelilah-Seyfried S. Positional cloning of heart and soul reveals multiple roles for PKC lambda in zebrafish organogenesis.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1492-1502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that Cdc42 controls tubulogenesis in vivo at several levels, and that aPKC activation through Par6 represents one of several Cdc42-controlled pathways involved in tubulogenesis. Cdc42 acts in several ways to establish a functional and mature apical surface, e.g., by interacting with the master polarity complex proteins Par3, Par6, and aPKC (Bryant and Mostov, 2008Bryant D.M. Mostov K.E. From cells to organs: building polarized tissue.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Par3 interaction with the Par6-aPKC complex is indispensable for apical domain development (Horikoshi et al., 2009Horikoshi Y. Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Sasaki K. Mizuno K. Sawada H. Yonemura S. Ohno S. Interaction between PAR-3 and the aPKC-PAR-6 complex is indispensable for apical domain development of epithelial cells.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, failure to establish a common apical domain in the absence of Cdc42 may be attributed to disturbed interaction of Par3 with the Par6-aPKC complex. Recently, it was demonstrated that Rho kinase (ROCK) also controls formation of the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex by phosphorylation of Par3, which prevents its interaction with Par6 and aPKC (Nakayama et al., 2008Nakayama M. Goto T.M. Sugimoto M. Nishimura T. Shinagawa T. Ohno S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Rho-kinase phosphorylates PAR-3 and disrupts PAR complex formation.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To test if blocking ROCK activity could restore apical polarity and tubulogenesis in the Cdc42 KO epithelium, WT and Cdc42 KO explants were incubated with the ROCK inhibitor, Y27632. Pharmacological inhibition of Rho kinase activity in vitro restored tube formation in the Cdc42 KO epithelium (Figure S10). Further studies are required to fully understand this intriguing result. Between E13.5 and E15.5, lineage commitment of multipotent Pdx1+ pancreatic progenitors toward exocrine and endocrine lineages is active (Gittes, 2008Gittes G.K. Developmental biology of the pancreas: A comprehensive review.Dev. Biol. 2008; 326: 4-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, Jorgensen et al., 2007Jorgensen M.C. Ahnfelt-Ronne J. Hald J.

Notably, these lineages appear at distinct anatomical positions within the developing tubular network. All peripheral epithelial cells, including “tip cells” and acinar progenitors (Zhou et al., 2007Zhou Q. Law A.C. Rajagopal J. Anderson W.J. Gray P.A. Melton D.A. A multipotent progenitor domain guides pancreatic organogenesis.Dev.

In contrast, before formation of a monolayered tubular epithelium, the central parts (trunk) of the epithelium consisting of endocrine and ductal progenitors are sparsely exposed to ECM and mesenchymal cells. The failure to organize Cdc42 KO multipotent pancreatic progenitors into tubes provides a model for addressing the importance of tissue/microenvironment asymmetry in cell specification. Ablation of Cdc42 had no impact on the expression of Pdx1, Nkx6.1, and Sox9 in Pdx1+ multipotent progenitors up until E13.5 (Figure S11B). A subpopulation of the multipotent progenitors confined to the tips of the tubular network, “tip cells,” express carboxypeptidase A1 (Cpa1), along with Pdx1, Ptf1a, and c-Myc until E14 (Zhou et al., 2007Zhou Q. Law A.C. Rajagopal J. Anderson W.J. Gray P.A. Melton D.A. A multipotent progenitor domain guides pancreatic organogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The fact that the Cdc42 KO pancreatic epithelium lacked distinct “tip-trunk” structures (Figures 5A, 5B, 5A′, and 5B′) led to a randomized distribution of “tip cell” markers, such as Cpa1 and Ptf1a. Although the total number of epithelial cells was unaffected, the relative number of Cpa1+ and Ptf1a+ progenitors increased at E13.5 (Figures 5C and 5D; data not shown). In addition, cleaved Caspase3 stainings showed no significant difference in the frequency of apoptotic cells between the WT and Cdc42 KO epithelium (0.56% ± 0.04% [WT] and 0.41% ± 0.11% [KO]). Thus, Cdc42-controlled tissue/microenvironment asymmetry is required for regulating the distribution and number of Cpa1+ and Ptf1a+ pancreatic progenitors. Quantification of Ngn3 mRNA expression demonstrated a significant reduction in Cdc42 KO samples at E14.5 (Figure 5G). Consistently, immunofluorescence staining of Ngn3 at E15.5 showed significantly fewer Ngn3-positive cells in the KO epithelium (Figures 5E and 5E′). In line with this observation, a dramatic reduction of insulin- and glucagon-expressing cells was observed at E15.5 (Figures 5F, 5F′, and 5H). These results show that differentiation toward endocrine cell lineages is severely compromised upon Cdc42 deficiency. In contrast, expression of Ptf1a, elastase, and amylase mRNAs and amylase and Cpa1 proteins increased, suggesting that acinar cell differentiation increased in the absence of Cdc42 (Figures 6A, 6B, 6A′, 6B′, and 6D–6F). In the WT pancreas Sox9 was distributed throughout the branching tubular tree, except for within the terminal acinar structures (Seymour et al., 2007Seymour P.A. Freude K.K. Tran M.N. Mayes E.E. Jensen J. Kist R. Scherer G. Sander M. SOX9 is required for maintenance of the pancreatic progenitor cell pool.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In the E15.5 Cdc42 KO epithelium very few Sox9+ duct cells were found and they were randomly distributed within the epithelial aggregates (Figures 6C and 6C′). At E17.5, the phenotype was comparable to E15.5 with many acinar cells but few endocrine and duct cells (Figure S12B). Postnatally, the Cdc42 KO animals were growth retarded and developed cysts in the stomach and a distended duodenum (Figure S12A). Moreover, acinar cysts developed within the pancreas. The majority of these cysts were multicellular consisting of polarized cells with apical junctions. However, large cysts from single cells were also observed (Figures S12B and S12C and data not shown). In summary, Cdc42 ablation results in increased acinar cell differentiation at the expense of endocrine and duct cell differentiation. This indicates that Cdc42 is required for proper specification of multipotent pancreatic progenitors into acinar, duct, and endocrine cells. In vitro culture of the embryonic pancreas in the absence of mesenchyme suppresses cell proliferation and acinar differentiation but enhances endocrine specification. Therefore, it was proposed that multipotent progenitors choose i"

Here, we show that this suppression results from nonoptimal regulation of ribosomal genes in the presence of DNA stress. Using GFP-tagged transcription reporters in Escherichia coli, we find that ribosomal genes are not directly regulated by DNA stress, leading to an imbalance between cellular DNA and protein content. To test whether ribosomal gene expression under DNA stress is nonoptimal for growth rate, we sequentially deleted up to six of the seven ribosomal RNA operons. These synthetic manipulations of ribosomal gene expression correct the protein-DNA imbalance, lead to improved survival and growth, and completely remove the suppressive drug interaction. A simple mathematical model explains the nonoptimal regulation of ribosomal genes under DNA stress as a side effect of their optimal regulation in different nutrient environments. These results reveal the genetic mechanism underlying an important class of suppressive drug interactions.

The interaction between two drugs can be classified as additive, synergistic, or antagonistic according to their combined effect being equal, greater, or less than that expected based on their individual effects, Figure 1A (Bliss, 1939Bliss C.I.

Much attention has been given to synergistic drug combinations due to their increased potency. Antagonism, however, may have an advantage in slowing down and even reversing the evolution of resistance (Chait et al., 2007Chait R. Craney A. Kishony R.

Functional classification of drugs by properties of their pairwise interactions.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A particularly strong kind of antagonism, termed “suppression,” occurs when the combined inhibitory effect of two drugs is not only weaker than the expected additive sum, but also weaker than the effect of one of the drugs alone (Figure 1A; Pillai et al., 2005Pillai S.K. Moellering R.C. Eliopoulos G.M. Antimicrobial combinations.in: Lorian V. Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2005: 365-440Google Scholar). We have previously reported that in the presence of a DNA synthesis-inhibiting antibiotic, the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor increases the steady state growth rate of Escherichia coli (Figure 1B) and Staphylococcus aureus (Chait et al., 2007Chait R. Craney A. Kishony R. Antibiotic interactions that select against resistance.Nature. 2007; 446: 668-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, Yeh et al., 2006Yeh P. Tschumi A.I. Kishony R. Functional classification of drugs by properties of their pairwise interactions.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Many different pairings of DNA synthesis and translation inhibitors show this suppressive drug interaction (Yeh et al., 2006Yeh P. Tschumi A.I. Kishony R. Functional classification of drugs by properties of their pairwise interactions.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar; see examples in Figures 1B and S1 available online), indicating that these interactions result from the effect of the drugs on bacterial physiology rather than from direct chemical interaction between the drugs.

Sci. 2007; 362: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), but the effects of drug combinations are less well understood and the mechanism that underlies suppressive drug interactions remains unknown. It has been argued that many aspects of bacterial physiology have evolved to be ‘optimal’ - namely to maximize growth rate in a given condition (Dekel and Alon, 2005Dekel E. Alon U. Optimality and evolutionary tuning of the expression level of a protein.Nature. 2005; 436: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, Ibarra et al., 2002Ibarra R.U. Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O.

Klipp E. Schuster S. Heinrich R. A theory of optimal differential gene expression.Biosystems. 2004; 76: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). When protein synthesis inhibitors are added to DNA synthesis inhibitors, however, the cells actually grow faster. Thus, the overall rate of protein synthesis under DNA stress appears to be above the optimal value for maximum growth. This overall rate of protein synthesis is primarily determined by the number of ribosomes per cell, which is known to be tightly controlled (Gralla, 2005Gralla J.D.

Genet. 2004; 38: 749-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Precise regulation of ribosome synthesis is crucial for maximizing growth: under-production of ribosomes causes ineffective use of cellular resources, while over-production leads to an excess use of resources for protein synthesis at the expense of other cellular processes (Gralla, 2005Gralla J.D.

Gourse R.L. rRNA transcription in Escherichia coli.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 749-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As a result, in any particular environment, there exists an optimal level of ribosomes that maximizes the bacterial growth rate (Figure 1C). The observation that, under DNA stress, reduction in protein synthesis allows faster growth suggests that ribosome level is not optimally regulated in these conditions. The rate of ribosome synthesis in E. coli is determined by the transcription rate of the ribosomal RNA operons (rrn operons; Keener and Nomura, 1996Keener J. Nomura M. Regulation of Ribosome Synthesis.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia Coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1417-1431Google Scholar, Paul et al., 2004Paul B.J. Ross W. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. rRNA transcription in Escherichia coli.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 749-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), which code for the three different ribosomal RNAs. Feedback mechanisms at the level of translation adjust ribosomal protein synthesis to stoichiometrically match rRNA production (Keener and Nomura, 1996Keener J. Nomura M. Regulation of Ribosome Synthesis.in: Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia Coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1417-1431Google Scholar). The standard E. coli lab strain K12 MG1655 has seven almost identical copies of the rrn operons, which are among the most highly transcribed loci in the genome. Multiple copies are needed because the maximal transcription rate from a single rrn operon is insufficient for the ribosome synthesis required at high growth rates (Condon et al., 1995Condon C.

The rrn operons are regulated to achieve maximal growth in different nutrient environments. The levels of factors that reflect intracellular levels of resources such as amino acids and energy, including nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), guanosine pentaphosphate and tetraphosphate (collectively referred to as ppGpp), affect rrn transcription (Cashel et al., 1996Cashel M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 8262-8268Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Overproduction of protein depletes these resources and thus downregulates ribosome synthesis (Gralla, 2005Gralla J.D. Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA transcription: regulatory roles for ppGpp, NTPs, architectural proteins and a polymerase-binding protein.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Paul et al., 2004Paul B.J. Ross W. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. rRNA transcription in Escherichia coli.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 749-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In many environmental conditions, this negative feedback loop is able to maintain ribosome concentration near its optimal level (the level that maximizes growth rate); in particular, ribosome synthesis is kept high in nutrient-rich environments and is shut down as a consequence of nutrient starvation (Cashel et al., 1996Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. The Stringent Response.in: Neidhardt F.C. Echerichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). However, it is unclear if the regulation of ribosome synthesis leads to optimal expression levels (maximal growth) under all stress conditions, and in particular under DNA stress (Figure 1C). The observation that, under DNA stress, inhibition of protein synthesis actually increases the rate of cellular growth suggests that the number of ribosomes per cell in these conditions is too high. Overexpression of ribosomes under these conditions would lead to an inefficient use of cellular resources and a growth rate that is lower than could be maximally achieved. Here, we test the hypothesis that the rate of ribosome synthesis in bacteria is nonoptimal under DNA stress, and that this nonoptimality causes the suppressive drug interactions in which translation inhibitors allow faster growth under DNA synthesis inhibition. We address this hypothesis by measuring cell composition, morphology and gene expression changes in response to antibiotics, by genetically manipulating ribosome synthesis, and by using a theoretical analysis of resource allocation in the cell. We first examined the changes in cell morphology and composition that result from treating cells with DNA synthesis inhibitors. These inhibitors cause DNA damage and trigger the SOS response, including expression of the cell division inhibitor sulA (Huisman and D'Ari, 1981Huisman O. D'Ari R. An inducible DNA replication-cell division coupling mechanism in E. coli.Nature. 1981; 290: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, Mesak et al., 2008Mesak L.R. Miao V. Davies J.

ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1400-1416Google Scholar). This prevents cell division before chromosome replication is completed (Huisman and D'Ari, 1981Huisman O. D'Ari R. An inducible DNA replication-cell division coupling mechanism in E. coli.Nature. 1981; 290: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), leading to an increased average cell size (Walker, 1996Walker G.C. The SOS Response of Escherichia coli.in: Neidhardt F.C. Echerichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1400-1416Google Scholar) and cell size variability, in particular at sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations where exponential growth occurs at a reduced rate (Figure 2A,B). The increased cell size under DNA stress correlates with an elevated average amount of protein per cell (Figure 2C; measured by a modified Lowry assay, Experimental Procedures). Cellular DNA, however, is typically still restricted to only one or two nucleoids (Figure 2A) and, with increasing concentration of DNA synthesis inhibitor, the mean DNA content decreases per volume and even per cell (Georgopapadakou and Bertasso, 1991Georgopapadakou N.H. Bertasso A. Effects of quinolones on nucleoid segregation in Escherichia coli.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 2645-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The ratio of protein to DNA therefore significantly increases in the presence of DNA synthesis inhibitors. We hypothesized that this imbalance could be caused by excessive production of ribosomes in the cell, leading to overproduction of proteins and thus to reduced growth rates. We therefore examined whether and how ribosome synthesis is regulated in response to DNA synthesis inhibitors. We used strains from a genome-wide GFP transcription reporter library (Zaslaver et al., 2006Zaslaver A. Bren A. Ronen M. Itzkovitz S. Kikoin I. Shavit S. Liebermeister W. Surette M.G. Alon U.

Mayo A.E. Rosenberg R. Bashkin P. Sberro H. Tsalyuk M. Surette M.G. Alon U. Just-in-time transcription program in metabolic pathways.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) to measure changes in the expression level of promoters from almost 200 E. coli genes, representing key cellular functions including DNA stress response, metabolism and ribosome regulation and synthesis (Table S1). We obtained high time resolution measurements of optical density and GFP fluorescence of cultures growing in the presence of different antibiotics at a range of concentrations. We focused on measurements during exponential growth phase since our main interest in this work is to understand the combined effects of drugs on steady state growth. Growth rates (g) were determined from the increase in optical density over time (OD, Figure 3A). Changes in gene expression level (γ) were defined as the effect of the drug on the average GFP signal per OD during exponential phase (γ = [GFP/OD] / [GFP/OD]no drug; Figure 3A and Experimental Procedures). By repeating the measurement at a range of drug concentrations, we determined expression level changes in response to antibiotics as a function of growth inhibition (see example for trimethoprim (TMP) in Figure 3B; antibiotics used in this study are summarized in Table 1). As expected, most SOS response genes were upregulated in response to DNA stress caused by any of three different DNA synthesis inhibitors (TMP, Figure 3B; ciprofloxacin [CPR] and nalidixic acid [NAL], Figure S2). On the other hand, most ribosomal genes were downregulated in response to these DNA synthesis inhibitors (Figures 3B, 3C, and S2). Consistent with the downregulation of ribosomal genes, the ppGpp-regulated ribosome inactivator gene rmf (Izutsu et al., 2001Izutsu K. Wada A. Wada C. Expression of ribosome modulation factor (RMF) in Escherichia coli requires ppGpp.Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was upregulated in response to TMP (Figure 3B).Table 1Antibiotics Used in This Study, Abbreviation, MIC in the Wild-Type MG1655 Strain, and Main Mode of ActionAntibioticAbbreviationMIC in LB (μg/ml)MIC in M9 (μg/ml)Mode of actionCiprofloxacinCPR0.0120.012DNA gyraseNalidixic acidNAL66DNA gyraseTrimethoprimTMP0.421.5Folic acid synthesisSpiramycinSPR192120Protein synthesis, 50STetracyclineTET1.51.5Protein synthesis, 30SNitrofurantoinNIT55Multiple mechanisms Open table in a new tab How much are ribosomal genes downregulated under DNA synthesis stress? Ribosome production is normally reduced when the growth rate of the cell is reduced (Bremer and Dennis, 1996Bremer H. Dennis P.P. Modulation of Chemical Composition and Other Parameters of the Cell by Growth Rate.in: Neidhardt F.C. Echerichia coli and Salmonella. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 1553-1569Google Scholar), but it is possible that the inhibition of DNA synthesis may also have a more specific effect on ribosome synthesis. To distinguish between nonspecific (growth-mediated) and specific effects of DNA synthesis inhibition on growth, we compared the change in expression of ribosomal genes in the presence of antibiotics that inhibit DNA synthesis to the change seen when growth rate is reduced using a poor growth medium. We found that, for equivalent reductions in cellular growth rate caused by these two mechanisms, the degree to which ribosomal gene expression is downregulated is essentially identical (Figures 3C and 3D). Thus, we see no evidence for specific regulation of ribosomal expression by DNA stress. While DNA synthesis inhibitors did not specifically regulate ribosome production, the translation inhibitors spiramycin (SPR) and tetracycline (TET) elicit an upregulation of ribosomal gene expression (Figure 3D) which counters the effect of these drugs, consistent with previous studies (Fraenkel and Neidhardt, 1961Fraenkel D.G.

Acta. 1961; 53: 96-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Kurland and Maaloe, 1962Kurland C.G. Maaløe O. Regulation of ribosomal and transfer RNA synthesis.J. Mol.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 8602-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We next asked how this upregulation of ribosomal genes in response to protein synthesis inhibitors is affected by the presence of DNA synthesis inhibitors. We measured the regulation of 80 promoters including nine that control ribosomal genes (Table S1) in a two-dimensional concentration matrix of TMP and SPR (Experimental Procedures). For each promoter, we obtained its fold change in expression level as a function of the two drug dosages (Figures 4A and S3; Experimental Procedures; Kaplan et al., 2008Kaplan S. Bren A. Zaslaver A.

Dual effects of MLS antibiotics: transcriptional modulation and interactions on the ribosome.Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1307-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We found that ribosomal gene expression levels in the presence of TMP are lower than in its absence for any SPR level (Figure 4A) and the upregulation of ribosomal genes by SPR is significantly delayed (occurs at higher SPR concentrations) under TMP stress (arrow in Figure 4B). Consequently, the increase in growth resulting from the addition of a translation inhibitor in the presence of a DNA synthesis inhibitor occurs without substantial increase in ribosome production. This delayed response allows a translation inhibitor to substantially reduce overall protein synthesis and restore the protein-DNA ratio to near its normal value (Piddock et al., 1990Piddock L.J. Walters R.N. Diver J.M. Correlation of quinolone MIC and inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and induction of the SOS response in Escherichia coli.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 2331-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), plausibly explaining the ability of translation inhibitors to increase the survival and growth of cells suffering DNA synthesis inhibition. Hence, the results discussed so far are consistent with the hypothesis that the ribosome synthesis rate is not optimally controlled under prolonged DNA stress; that is, it is not sufficiently downregulated to maximize cellular growth rate. But how can we test this hypothesis more directly? The hallmark of nonoptimality is the possibility for improvement: if cellular production of ribosomes is indeed nonoptimal under DNA stress, we should be able to manipulate it to increase cellular survival and growth. To test whether direct manipulation of ribosome levels affects growth and survival in the presence of DNA synthesis inhibitors, we measured responses to antibiotics in strains that are engineered to decrease or increase ribosome synthesis.

However, the mechanisms of these effects are not completely understood. Using the BV-2 mouse microglial cell line and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce an inflammatory response, we studied the signaling pathways engaged in the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabinoids as well as their influence on the expression of several genes known to be involved in inflammation. We found that the two major cannabinoids present in marijuana, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), decrease the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and interferon (IFN)beta, from LPS-activated microglial cells. The cannabinoid anti-inflammatory action does not seem to involve the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors or the abn-CBD-sensitive receptors. In addition, we found that THC and CBD act through different, although partially overlapping, mechanisms. CBD, but not THC, reduces the activity of the NF-kappaB pathway, a primary pathway regulating the expression of proinflammatory genes. Moreover, CBD, but not THC, up-regulates the activation of the STAT3 transcription factor, an element of homeostatic mechanism(s) inducing anti-inflammatory events. Following CBD treatment, but less so with THC, we observed a decreased level of mRNA for the Socs3 gene, a main negative regulator of STATs and particularly of STAT3. However, both CBD and THC decreased the activation of the LPS-induced STAT1 transcription factor, a key player in IFNbeta-dependent proinflammatory processes. In summary, our observations show that CBD and THC vary in their effects on the anti-inflammatory pathways, including the NF-kappaB and IFNbeta-dependent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2047841142,"Genome haploidization during meiosis depends on recognition and association of parental homologous chromosomes. The C. elegans SUN/KASH domain proteins Matefin/SUN-1 and ZYG-12 have a conserved role in this process. They bridge the nuclear envelope, connecting the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm to transmit forces that allow chromosome movement and homolog pairing and prevent nonhomologous synapsis. Here, we show that Matefin/SUN-1 forms rapidly moving aggregates at putative chromosomal attachment sites in the meiotic transition zone (TZ). We analyzed requirements for aggregate formation and identified multiple phosphotarget residues in the nucleoplasmic domain of Matefin/SUN-1. These CHK-2 dependent phosphorylations occur in leptotene/zygotene, diminish during pachytene and are involved in pairing. Mimicking phosphorylation causes an extended TZ and univalents at diakinesis. Our data suggest that the properties of the nuclear envelope are altered during the time window when homologs are sorted and Matefin/SUN-1 aggregates form, thereby controling the movement, homologous pairing and interhomolog recombination of chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2102031413,"For budding yeast to ensure formation of only one bud, cells must polarize toward one, and only one, site. Polarity establishment involves the Rho family GTPase Cdc42, which concentrates at polarization sites via a positive feedback loop. To assess whether singularity is linked to the specific Cdc42 feedback loop, we disabled the yeast cell's endogenous amplification mechanism and synthetically rewired the cells to employ a different positive feedback loop. Rewired cells violated singularity, occasionally making two buds. Even cells that made only one bud sometimes initiated two clusters of Cdc42, but then one cluster became dominant. Mathematical modeling indicated that, given sufficient time, competition between clusters would promote singularity. In rewired cells, competition occurred slowly and sometimes failed to develop a single “winning” cluster before budding. Slowing competition in normal cells also allowed occasional formation of two buds, suggesting that singularity is enforced by rapid competition between Cdc42 clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2066607065,"Signaling proteins driving the proliferation of stem and progenitor cells are often encoded by proto-oncogenes. EphB receptors represent a rare exception; they promote cell proliferation in the intestinal epithelium and function as tumor suppressors by controlling cell migration and inhibiting invasive growth. We show that cell migration and proliferation are controlled independently by the receptor EphB2. EphB2 regulated cell positioning is kinase-independent and mediated via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, whereas EphB2 tyrosine kinase activity regulates cell proliferation through an Abl-cyclin D1 pathway. Cyclin D1 regulation becomes uncoupled from EphB signaling during the progression from adenoma to colon carcinoma in humans, allowing continued proliferation with invasive growth. The dissociation of EphB2 signaling pathways enables the selective inhibition of the mitogenic effect without affecting the tumor suppressor function and identifies a pharmacological strategy to suppress adenoma growth."

This study identifies Math1-dependent neurons that are critical for perinatal breathing that may link proprioception and arousal with respiration. Respiration requires the coordinated effort of rhythm-generating neurons in the hindbrain, modulatory inputs, sensory feedback, and multiple muscle groups. Disruption of this network likely underlies respiratory disorders such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS, Ondine's curse) and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the leading cause of postneonatal infant mortality in the U.S. In CCHS, patients fail to increase respiration or arouse from sleep in response to increasing blood CO2 levels (Severinghaus and Mitchell, 1962Severinghaus J.W. Mitchell R.A. Ondine's curse—failure of respiratory center automatically while awake.Clin. Res. 1962; 10: 122Google Scholar). Similarly, infants who have died of SIDS appear to have been unable to arouse from sleep in response to hypoxia (Kato et al., 2003Kato I. Franco P. Groswasser J. Scaillet S. Kelmanson I. Togari H. Kahn A. Incomplete arousal processes in infants who were victims of sudden death.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 168: 1298-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A more complete understanding of the respiratory network in the hindbrain could provide insight into the pathogenesis of these disorders. Respiratory rhythm-generating neurons reside within the ventral respiratory column (VRC) of the medulla. The pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) generates the inspiratory rhythm (Smith et al., 1991Smith J.C. Ellenberger H.H. Ballanyi K. Richter D.W. Feldman J.L. Pre-Botzinger complex: a brainstem region that may generate respiratory rhythm in mammals.Science. 1991; 254: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar) and receives modulatory input from adjacent nuclei, including a region located around the facial motor nucleus just rostral to the preBötC. Different investigators refer to neurons in this region either as the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) or as the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). Neurons in the pFRG have been proposed to function as a preinspiratory or expiratory-modulating nucleus in newborns (Janczewski and Feldman, 2006Janczewski W.A. Feldman J.L. Distinct rhythm generators for inspiration and expiration in the juvenile rat.J. Physiol. 2006; 570: 407-420PubMed Google Scholar, Onimaru and Homma, 2003Onimaru H. Homma I. A novel functional neuron group for respiratory rhythm generation in the ventral medulla.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1478-1486PubMed Google Scholar); the RTN contains chemosensitive neurons that respond to changing CO2 levels in adults (Pearce et al., 1989Pearce R.A. Stornetta R.L. Guyenet P.G.

While it remains unclear whether the pFRG and RTN neurons are the same, recent genetic studies have indicated some overlap, and we will refer to them as the pFRG/RTN. Recent studies have shown that pFRG/RTN neurons express the transcription factors paired-like homeobox 2b (Phox2b) and ladybird homeobox homolog 1 (Lbx1) (Dubreuil et al., 2008Dubreuil V.

Another important gene expressed by both pFRG/RTN and some rhythmogenic preBötC neurons is the substance P receptor NK1R (Gray et al., 1999Gray P.A. Rekling J.C. Bocchiaro C.M. Feldman J.L.

Physiol. 2002; 544: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The NK1R neurons in both nuclei are glutamatergic, expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) (Guyenet et al., 2002Guyenet P.G. Sevigny C.P. Weston M.C. Stornetta R.L. Neurokinin-1 receptor-expressing cells of the ventral respiratory group are functionally heterogeneous and predominantly glutamatergic.J.

Glutamatergic neuronal projections from the marginal layer of the rostral ventral medulla to the respiratory centers in rats.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 473: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Excitatory glutamatergic modulation appears critical for respiratory rhythmogenesis (Greer et al., 1991Greer J.J. Smith J.C.

Physiol. 2007; 582: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but the full impact of glutamatergic neurons outside the preBötC remains unclear. The respiratory rhythm receives additional modulation from nuclei in the pons. These nuclei include the parabrachial/Kölliker-Fuse (PB/KF) nucleus and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) of the reticular activating system, which together integrate visceral and somatic sensory information to regulate arousal and sleep states (Chamberlin and Saper, 1994Chamberlin N.L.

Neurobiol. 2004; 143: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Failure of arousal mechanisms appears to contribute to both CCHS and SIDS, and one key component of arousal involves proprioceptive stimuli. Stretching and yawning movements generate proprioceptive sensory input to help stimulate the reticular activating system and arouse the cortex (McNamara et al., 1998McNamara F. Wulbrand H. Thach B.T. Characteristics of the infant arousal response.J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 85: 2314-2321PubMed Google Scholar). Proprioception involves the cerebellum, which shows abnormalities in some children who die from SIDS, suggesting that deficits in both proprioception and arousal may contribute to respiratory dysfunction in these patients (Kato et al., 2003Kato I. Franco P. Groswasser J. Scaillet S. Kelmanson I. Togari H. Kahn A. Incomplete arousal processes in infants who were victims of sudden death.Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Alterations of biological features of the cerebellum in sudden perinatal and infant death.Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One key player in hindbrain development is the proneural transcription factor mouse atonal homolog 1 (Math1, Atoh1). Mice lacking Math1 lose multiple components of the auditory, proprioceptive, interoceptive, and arousal systems, including many glutamatergic neurons (Ben-Arie et al., 2000Ben-Arie N.

Math1 expression redefines the rhombic lip derivatives and reveals novel lineages within the brainstem and cerebellum.Neuron. 2005; 48: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and die shortly after birth from an apparent inability to initiate respiration. The lungs, airways, and peripheral nerves appear normal in Math1 null mice, suggesting that the problem lies in some unidentified defect in the central nervous system (Ben-Arie et al., 1997Ben-Arie N. Bellen H.J. Armstrong D.L. McCall A.E. Gordadze P.R. Guo Q. Matzuk M.M. Zoghbi H.Y. Math1 is essential for genesis of cerebellar granule neurons.Nature. 1997; 390: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Pinpointing the mechanism underlying their respiratory failure might shed light on the vital connections between respiration, proprioception, and arousal. We generated a Math1-GFP fusion allele (Math1M1GFP) to identify and track hindbrain lineages displaying novel Math1 expression outside the neuroepithelium and used a hormonally inducible Math1Cre∗PR allele (Rose et al., 2009Rose M.F. Ahmad K.A. Thaller C. Zoghbi H.Y. Excitatory neurons of the proprioceptive, interoceptive, and arousal hindbrain networks share a developmental requirement for Math1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar) in combination with Cre-reporters to trace the projections of Math1-dependent lineages within the hindbrain respiratory network. In conjunction with these fate-mapping approaches, we characterized the respiratory physiology in the perinatal Math1 null hindbrain to ascertain which neuromodulators affect the respiratory rhythm. We discovered that proper development of the pFRG/RTN neurons requires Math1 and determined that modulating the glutamatergic system reestablishes a respiratory rhythm in Math1 null preparations. In addition, these studies identify candidate neurons that should be evaluated in respiratory disorders such as CCHS and SIDS. Math1 null mice take only occasional gasps without yawning or stretching, never establish patterned respiration, and become unresponsive by 30–45 min after delivery. To assess the centrally generated respiratory rhythmogenesis in Math1 null mice, we analyzed the respiratory rhythm via diaphragmatic electromyography (EMG) from in vitro preparations that contained the brainstem and spinal cord connected to the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve (Figure 1A, dotted yellow circle indicates the preBötC, and black region ventral to the gray facial motor nucleus indicates the pFRG/RTN). Since Math1-dependent lineages are found in the cerebellum, pons, and medulla, we compared EMG from three preparations to help define the region containing Math1 populations vital for respiration: (i) medulla alone (standard preparation), (ii) pons-medulla, and (iii) cerebellum-pons-medulla. These three preparations are depicted by the three distinct hindbrain models (Figure 1A′; see Table S1 for frequency, sample size, and coefficients of variation). Compared to wild-type (WT), all three Math1 null preparations (i–iii, right column) generated slower and more variable respiratory rhythms, retaining primarily large-amplitude discharges with long periods of inactivity interrupted by short bursts (Figure 1A″ and quantified in Figure 1C). The Math1 null rhythm remained significantly depressed when recorded directly from either the C4 spinal cord or hypoglossal cranial roots (i.e., brainstem-spinal cord preparation without diaphragm), indicating that the deficit is not at the neuromuscular junction (Figure 1C). Medullary slice preparations containing the preBötC rhythmogenesis center (depicted in Figure 1B) also showed a slower rhythm in the Math1 null preparation (Figure 1B′). These results establish that Math1 null mice die from severe central apnea and suggest that the limiting deficit in respiratory rhythmogenesis lies within the medulla. We next sought to identify the cellular basis for the respiratory deficit in Math1 null mice. Math1 is expressed during development in the rhombic lip, the dorsal-most hindbrain neuroepithelium, from which Math1-dependent neurons migrate to populate various hindbrain nuclei (Machold and Fishell, 2005Machold R.

Math1 expression redefines the rhombic lip derivatives and reveals novel lineages within the brainstem and cerebellum.Neuron. 2005; 48: 31-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Only one other region is known to express Math1 in the developing hindbrain: the external granule layer (EGL) of the cerebellum, which is contiguous with the rhombic lip (Ben-Arie et al., 1997Ben-Arie N. Bellen H.J. Armstrong D.L. McCall A.E. Gordadze P.R. Guo Q. Matzuk M.M. Zoghbi H.Y. Math1 is essential for genesis of cerebellar granule neurons.Nature. 1997; 390: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether Math1 expression outside the rhombic lip and EGL plays a role in neuronal development. Analysis of Math1 mRNA on E14.5 sagittal sections (region depicted in Figure 2A) uncovered previously unreported expression domains around the trigeminal (V) and facial (VII) motor nuclei (Figures 2B and 2B′, yellow arrowheads). This paramotor Math1 mRNA expression was present by E11.5 and disappeared by birth (data not shown). In Math1LacZ/LacZ null hindbrains, in which Math1 is replaced by LacZ (Ben-Arie et al., 2000Ben-Arie N. Hassan B.A. Bermingham N.A. Malicki D.M. Armstrong D. Matzuk M. Bellen H.J. Zoghbi H.Y.

While the Math1LacZ/+ medulla showed clusters of LacZ cells at the rostral and caudal poles of VII and scattered along its ventral surface, labeled cells in the Math1LacZ/LacZ medulla were predominantly at the lateral edge of VII (compare Figures 2C′ and 2D′, magnifications). Coronal sections through an E16.5 Math1LacZ/+ hindbrain (approximate levels 1–3 on Figures 2A and 2C) revealed that some of these LacZ populations resided in the intertrigeminal region (Figure 2E, yellow arrowheads) and pFRG/RTN (Figures 2F, yellow arrow, and 2G, yellow arrowhead) and were contiguous with additional labeled cells around each motor nucleus (open yellow arrowheads). These observations describe previously unreported persistent Math1 hindbrain expression outside the rhombic lip and EGL and identify a distinct population of cells that do not require Math1 to exit the neuroepithelium. Because LacZ persists longer than the Math1 protein, it cannot distinguish between cells actively expressing Math1 and those that recently stopped (Wang et al., 2005Wang V.Y. Rose M.F. Zoghbi H.Y.

We therefore targeted a Math1-EGFP fusion allele (M1GFP) into the Math1 genomic locus to generate homozygous viable Math1M1GFP/M1GFP mice (Figure 3). The resulting Math1EGFP fusion protein could then be identified with antibodies to GFP. Using the Math1M1GFP allele, we assessed whether parafacial Math1 expression labeled pFRG/RTN neurons, which are known to express Phox2b, Lbx1, and NK1R. At E16.5, Math1 colabeled with Phox2b and NK1R in the pFRG/RTN (Figures 4A–4E), but not with tyrosine hydroxylase (data not shown), consistent with previous studies of the pFRG/RTN.Figure 4Parafacial Math1 Neurons Contribute to the pFRG/RTNShow full caption(A) Magnification of the ventral respiratory column from an E16.5 Math1M1GFP/M1GFP hindbrain, as indicated by the black rectangle on the inset model of the hindbrain (black ventral region is pFRG/RTN while yellow circle indicates preBötC), showing NK1R (red), Phox2b (blue), and Math1EGFP (green) expression.

Scale bar, 120 μm (A), 35 μm (B–E), 10 μm (B′–E′). We next sought to characterize the early development of pFRG/RTN neurons. Paramotor expression of Math1 protein was first detected at E12.0 in cells coexpressing both Phox2b and Lbx1 (Figure 5A, yellow/white cells), whereas Math1 lineages exiting the caudal rhombic lip (cRL) expressed neither of these genes (Figure 5A, green cells). The rostral extent of Math1 paramotor expression coincided with that of Lbx1 in the pons (Figure 5B, dotted line). Twelve hours earlier, at E11.5, no paramotor Math1 protein expression was detected, although many cells coexpressed Phox2b/Lbx1 (Figures 5C and 5H, purple cells in corresponding yellow and white boxed magnifications shown at right). From E12.0 to E16.5, a subset of the paramotor Phox2b/Lbx1 neurons coexpressed Math1 and appeared to migrate around the motor nuclei, creating paratrigeminal and parafacial arrangements of triple-labeled neurons (Figures 5D–5G and 5I–5L). (Note: images of paratrigeminal regions were rotated 90° to align the ventral surfaces of the developing pons and medulla.) In summary, the new Math1M1GFP allele provided clear antibody labeling of Math1 protein in the developing mouse hindbrain. This immunolabeling identified the pFRG/RTN neurons and a distinct group of paratrigeminal cells and allowed us to track the development of these lineages. In addition to the pFRG/RTN, NK1R labels the preBötC, paratrigeminal region, and parabrachial nucleus, all important for breathing (positions noted in Figures 6A and 6B). To assess whether Math1 is required for proper development of these nuclei, we compared the NK1R expression in WT and Math1 null hindbrains at E18.5 and noted loss of NK1R in the parabrachial (Figure 6C), ventral paratrigeminal (Figure 6D), and pFRG/RTN nuclei (Figures 6E and 6F, yellow arrow). The majority of pFRG/RTN Phox2b and Lbx1 expression was similarly lost (Figures 6G and 6H, yellow arrow). In contrast, the preBötC continued to express NK1R (Figures 6E and 6F, yellow circle), as well as somatostatin, another marker of preBötC neurons (Figures 6G and 6H, yellow circle). Math1 null mice also had decreased Vglut2 glutamatergic projections through much of the rostral medulla and pons, including the parafacial region, but retained extensive Vglut2 projections in the preBötC and the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG), which projects rhythm output to phrenic motor neurons in the spinal cord (Figures 6I and 6J). These remaining Vglut2 processes may arise in part from the spared preBötC neurons, some of which are known to be synaptically coupled and glutamatergic (Guyenet et al., 2002Guyenet P.G. Sevigny C.P. Weston M.C. Stornetta R.L. Neurokinin-1 receptor-expressing cells of the ventral respiratory group are functionally heterogeneous and predominantly glutamatergic.J.

AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors cooperatively generate inspiratory-like depolarization in mouse respiratory neurons in vitro.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 2434-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Vglut1 projections were also lost just rostral to VII in a region primarily devoted to hearing (data not shown). Thus, although several respiratory rhythm-modulating neurons are disrupted in the Math1 null hindbrain, the preBötC rhythmogenic neurons are preserved and retain many excitatory glutamatergic processes in their vicinity. We used the Math1LacZ null allele to assess the fate of pFRG/RTN neurons, labeled by LacZ protein (βGal), in Math1 null mice. Comparison of E16.5 Math1LacZ/+ and Math1LacZ/LacZ hindbrains at positions (1) and (2) indicated in Figure 6B reveals that in the absence of Math1, βGal cells extended only partway along the ventral surface of VII (Figures 6K and 6M, yellow arrowhead), clustering more dorsolateral to VII, and were virtually absent from the caudal pole of VII (Figures 6L and 6N). Although the misplaced pFRG/RTN neurons continued to express Phox2b and Lbx1 in Math null mice (Figures 6O and 6P), they no longer expressed NK1R (Figures 6Q and 6R). Math1 is thus required for both proper migration and NK1R expression in developing pFRG/RTN neurons. We recently identified multiple Math1-dependent rhombic lip-derived populations in the medulla, including neurons near the pFRG/RTN, preBötC, and rVRG in the ventral respiratory column (VRC) (Rose et al., 2009Rose M.F.

To trace the projections of these neurons, we crossed hormone-inducible Math1Cre∗PR/+ mice (Rose et al., 2009Rose M.F. Ahmad K.A. Thaller C. Zoghbi H.Y.

MDM2 and MDMX overexpression or hyperactivation directly contributes to the loss of p53 function during the development of nearly 50% of human cancers. Recent studies showed that disrupting p53-MDM2 and p53-MDMX interactions can lead to robust activation of p53 but also revealed a need to develop novel dual specific or MDMX-specific inhibitors. Using phage display we identified a 12-residue peptide (pDI) with inhibitory activity against MDM2 and MDMX. The co-crystal structures of the pDI and a single mutant derivative (pDI6W) liganded with the N-terminal domains of human MDMX and MDM2 served as the basis for the design of 11 distinct pDI-derivative peptides that were tested for inhibitory potential. The best derivative (termed pDIQ) contained four amino acid substitutions and exhibited a 5-fold increase in potency over the parent peptide against both MDM2 (IC(50) = 8 nm) and MDMX (IC(50) = 110 nm). Further structural studies revealed key molecular features enabling the high affinity binding of the pDIQ to these proteins. These include large conformational changes of the pDIQ to reach into a hydrophobic site unique to MDMX. The findings suggest new strategies toward the rational design of small molecule inhibitors efficiently targeting MDMX."

Jmjd1a is a key epigenetic regulator expressed in the testis. It specifically demethylates mono- and di-methylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me1 and H3K9me2) but not tri-methylated H3K9 (H3K9me3). In this study, we generated a Jmjd1a antibody for immunohistochemistry and found Jmjd1a was specifically produced in pachytene and secondary spermatocytes. Disruption of the Jmjd1a gene in mice significantly increased H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 levels in pachytene spermatocytes and early elongating spermatids without affecting H3K9me3 levels. Concurrently, the levels of histone acetylation were decreased in Jmjd1a knock-out germ cells. This suggests Jmjd1a promotes transcriptional activation by lowering histone methylation and increasing histone acetylation. Interestingly, the altered histone modifications in Jmjd1a-deficient germ cells caused diminished cAMP-response element modulator (Crem) recruitment to chromatin and decreased expression of the Crem coactivator Act and their target genes Tnp1 (transition protein 1), Tnp2, Prm1 (protamine 1), and Prm2, all of which are essential for chromatin condensation in spermatids. In agreement with these findings, Jmjd1a deficiency caused extensive germ cell apoptosis and blocked spermatid elongation, resulting in severe oligozoospermia, small testes, and infertility in male mice.

Male reproductive function of mammals relies on normal spermatogenesis within the seminiferous epithelium of the testis (1Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. Sinha-Hikim A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990: 1-161Google Scholar). During spermatogenesis, the spermatogonia undergo mitosis and differentiate into spermatocytes. The primary spermatocytes process through preleptotene, leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene meiotic steps to generate secondary spermatocytes. Subsequently, the secondary spermatocytes enter the spermatid stages and undergo dramatic morphological changes, finally differentiating into mature spermatozoa. During this last phase, acrosomes and tails form, chromatins condense, and spermatid heads elongate (1Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. Sinha-Hikim A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990: 1-161Google Scholar). Interestingly, in cross-sectioned seminiferous tubules, each type of germ cell appears developmentally synchronized, and a defined grouping of germ cell types at particular developmental steps is constantly associated. In the mouse seminiferous epithelium, 12 groups of cell associations or “stages” (I–XII) can be steadily recognized according to the criteria established previously (1Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. Sinha-Hikim A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990: 1-161Google Scholar).

Spermiogenesis requires extensive chromatin condensation.

The transcripts of these genes can be first detected in step 7 round spermatids in mice, and the transcriptional activation of these genes is mainly regulated by the transcription factor Crem (2Mali P.

Unlike its close family member cAMP-response element-binding protein, which is activated by phosphorylation, the transcriptional activity of Crem is mainly mediated by a coactivator, the activator of Crem in the testis (Act) (8Fimia G.M.

Although the mechanisms responsible for histone displacement are unclear, histone variants and histone modifications may play important roles. During spermatogenesis, high levels of general and testis-specific histone variants are expressed and associated with DNA. This association alters nucleosome stability and facilitates histone displacement (12Govin J. Caron C. Lestrat C. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Accordingly, knock-out of certain histone variants can arrest spermiogenesis at elongation steps and reduce male fertility (13Martianov I. Brancorsini S. Catena R. Gansmuller A. Kotaja N. Parvinen M.

Correct epigenetic modifications of histones may also be important for regulating gene expression essential for spermatogenesis and spermatid chromatin condensation. It has been observed that highly acetylated histone H4 is present only in early elongating spermatids prior to histone displacement and positively correlates with histone condensation (16Meistrich M.L.

Histone methylation is also tightly regulated during spermatogenesis, and distinct patterns of histone methylation have been observed at specific stages of spermatogenesis (19Tachibana M. Nozaki M.

Although it is unclear how histone modifications are involved in the regulation of gene expression and histone displacement, it is conceivable that epigenetic modifications of histones may alter chromatin architecture and change gene expression profile required for normal spermatogenesis.

We have found that Jmjd1a is expressed in a germ cell type-specific and developmental step-specific manner. Furthermore, we have generated Jmjd1a knock-out mice and found that Jmjd1a deficiency results in severe oligozoospermia and male infertility. In addition, we also investigated the Jmjd1a-regulated epigenetic and genetic events essential for spermatogenesis, such as activation of Crem target genes. Genomic DNA was purified from the TC-1 mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with a 129SvEv/j strain background (37Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and used for amplifying the homologous arms of the Jmjd1a targeting vector by using an LA PCR kit (Takara Bio. Inc.). The 5′ arm DNA was amplified by using primers Jmjd1a-5F (cggttaattaactttcctctttaggggcac) and Jmjd1a-5R (aatgcggccgcttgtaaaaccaaccaac). The 3′ arm DNA was amplified by using primers Jmjd1a-3F (aatctcgagtaccatgcgcgtgagtgataaagctac) and Jmjd1a-3R (aaaggatccgcctggtctacagagcacaaactctca). PCR products were subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO plasmids using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and verified by DNA sequencing. The 5′ arm DNA was isolated from the TOPO vector and subcloned into the PacI and NotI sites of the pFRT-LoxP plasmid (38Liu W. Selever J. Wang D. Lu M.F. Moses K.A. Schwartz R.J. Martin J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4489-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), so the integrated 5′ arm was upstream of a PGK-neo cassette (Fig. 1A). The 3′ arm DNA was transferred from the TOPO vector to the pFRT-LoxP plasmid by XhoI and BamHI digestions, and the integrated 3′ arm was located between the PGK-neo and the HSV-tk (thymidine kinase) cassettes (Fig. 1A). The targeting vector was linearized by PacI digestion. TC-1 ES cells were cultured and electroporated with the targeting vector DNA as described (37Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in selection medium containing 300 μg/ml geneticin and 0.2 μm 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil for 7 days. Surviving clones were isolated and screened by Southern blot analyses using 5′ and 3′ probes located outside the targeting region and a neo probe (Fig. 1A). DNA samples were digested with XhoI and EcoRV for Southern blot (Fig. 1A). Targeted ES clones were injected into E3.5 blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice, and the injected blastocysts were transferred into the uteri of pseudo-pregnant mice. Resulting chimeric males were mated with C57BL/6 females, and their agouti progenies were genotyped by Southern blot, as described above, and PCR using primers Jmjd1a-ICF (ATCTGATGCAGCCAATGTCA) and Jmjd1a-ICR (GGCTCCTGGCTTCTCTTTTC) for detecting the Jmjd1a wild type (WT) allele and primers KOV1 (gaaagtataggaacttcgtcgacctc) and Jmjd1a33 (ctaagccagggataaggactttca) for detecting the Jmjd1a knock-out allele (Fig. 1A). Heterozygous (Jmjd1a+/−) mice were used in further breeding to produce age-matched WT, Jmjd1a+/−, and homozygous knock-out (Jmjd1a−/−) mice for experiments (Fig. 1C). Jmjd1a antibody was generated in rabbits immunized with a recombinant polypeptide of the mouse Jmjd1a. Briefly, RNA was purified from mouse testes, and cDNA was made by reverse transcription. The DNA fragment for residues Asn308–Asn566 of Jmjd1a was amplified by PCR using primers Jmjd1a-30 (catgcgcatatgactccatctagcaaggacccaag) and Jmjd1a-31 (ccatggatccacaggagagtccttctgctggtc). The amplified DNA was subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET-16b plasmid (Novagen). BL21-competent bacteria were transformed with the plasmids and used to produce the Jmjd1a polypeptide. The soluble 32-kDa Jmjd1a polypeptide was purified from bacterial lysates prepared from isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacterial culture by using 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads as described (39Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 15.44-15.48Google Scholar). The concentration of purified protein was estimated by comparing with serial dilutions of bovine serum albumin standards on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue. The purified protein (1 mg/ml) was used as a Jmjd1a antigen, and the rabbit immunization was carried out through a service contract with the Proteintech Group, Inc. Mouse testes were collected and homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Following sonication and centrifugation, protein concentrations in the tissue extracts were measured by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Aliquots containing 10 μg of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with primary antibodies against Jmjd1a, H3K9me1 (ab9045, Abcam), H3K9me2 (07-441, Upstate), H3K9me3 (07-442, Upstate), H3 (ab1791, Abcam), H3K27me2 (9755, Cell Signaling), acetylated H4K5/8/12/16 (06-866, Upstate), acetylated H3K9/14 (06-599, Upstate), acetylated H3K9 (39586, Active Motif), acetylated H3K56 (04-1135, Upstate), Crem (sc-440, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Tnp1 (gift from Dr. Stephen Kistler, University of South Carolina), and β-actin (Sigma). Appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and the ECL chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used to detect the bound primary antibodies. Sperm count was performed as described (40Wu J.Y. Ribar T.J. Cummings D.E. Burton K.A. McKnight G.S. Means A.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 41Mark M.

Briefly, for each adult mouse, one caudal epididymis was used for histological examination, and the other one was minced in 1 ml of PBS. Sperms were allowed to disperse into solution by incubating for 5 min. A small volume of solution containing the sperm was transferred into a hemocytometer and allowed to settle for 15 min prior to counting. The average number of sperm per epididymis was calculated from three mice for each genotype group. Blood samples were collected from 10-week-old male WT and Jmjd1a−/− mice by periorbital puncture. Serum samples were prepared as described (42Jeyaraj D.A. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Steroids. 2005; 70: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The testosterone in the testis was extracted as described (42Jeyaraj D.A. Grossman G. Petrusz P. Steroids. 2005; 70: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, one testis from each mouse was homogenized in 250 μl of PBS at room temperature. Homogenates were first extracted with 5 ml of diethyl ether and then extracted with 3 ml of diethyl ether again. The combined diethyl ether extracts were evaporated at room temperature in a fume hood and then resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The concentrations of testosterone in the serum samples and the testis extracts were measured by using an ELISA kit (DSL-10-4000, Diagnostic Systems Laboratories). Testes were fixed in modified Davidson’s fluid overnight at 4 °C (43Latendresse J.R. Warbrittion A.R. Jonassen H. Creasy D.M. Toxicol. Pathol. 2002; 30: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Fixed tissues were washed in PBS, dehydrated in ethanol, incubated in xylene, and then embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were cut to a thickness of 5 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with a periodic acid-Schiff and hematoxylin kit (395B, Sigma). The specific steps of the germ cell development and differentiation during spermatogenesis and the stages of seminiferous epithelium were determined according to the well established criteria described previously (1Russell L.D. Ettlin R.A. Sinha-Hikim A.P. Clegg E.D. Histological and Histopathological Evaluation of the Testis. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1990: 1-161Google Scholar). For preparation of semi-thin sections, testes were perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.0% formaldehyde and fixed at 4 °C overnight. The fixed samples were dehydrated and embedded in Spurr’s low viscosity resin (EMS, Hatfield, PA). Semi-thin sections 1 μm in thickness were prepared by using an RMC MT6000-XL ultramicrotome and were stained with toluidine blue for microscopy. Deparaffinized and hydrated tissue sections were incubated in a 10 μm sodium citrate buffer at 95 °C for 10 min for retrieving antigens and then treated in methanol containing 3% H2O2 for quenching endogenous peroxidase. After incubating in PBS containing 10% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100, tissue sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with a primary antibody against Jmjd1a, H3K9me1, H3K9me2, or H3K9me3. Subsequently, the washed sections were incubated with a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and the avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase in the Vectastain ABC-AP kit (AK-5200, Vector Laboratories). The horseradish peroxidase activities were visualized by using a DAB substrate kit (SK-4100, Vector Laboratories). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin or periodic acid-Schiff and hematoxylin and sealed in Permount for microscopy and imaging. Seminiferous tubules were isolated from wild type and knock- out mice. After incubating in 1% sodium citrate for 30 min, the tubules were fixed in Carnoy’s solution (75% methanol and 25% acetic acid) overnight at 4 °C. The fixed tubules were then incubated in 60% acetic acid for 2 min. Single cell suspension was obtained by repeated pipetting. Cell suspension was then spread on pre-heated slides at 60 °C and dried (26Peters A.H. O’Carroll D. Scherthan H. Mechtler K. Sauer S. Schöfer C. Weipoltshammer K. Pagani M. Lachner M. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Doyle M. Sibilia M. Jenuwein T. Cell. 2001; 107: 323-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was done as described above except that the TSA kit (Invitrogen, T-20911) was used to amplify Jmjd1a signals. Propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) was used to stain chromosomes. Total RNA was purified from the testes of 10-week-old WT and Jmjd1a−/− mice using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The real time RT-PCR was performed by using the reverse transcriptase core kit (Eurogentec) and the Universal Mouse Probe Sets for TaqMan PCR (Roche Applied Science). The mRNA-specific primer pairs were designed, and the specific match of universal mouse probe sets was determined by running the software at Universal Probe Library Design Center. Relative mRNA concentrations were obtained by normalizing to the endogenous levels of 18 S RNA. Cells were isolated from the testes of adult WT and Jmjd1a−/− mice as described (44Boulanger C.A. Mack D.L. Booth B.W. Smith G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3871-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tunica albuginea of mouse testes was removed. The remaining tissues were digested by 0.5 mg/ml collagenase in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 32 °C for 15 min, washed in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and further digested by 0.5 mg/ml trypsin and 1 μg/ml DNase in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After pipetting 10–12 times and washing with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, cells were filtered through a 40-micron filter and diluted to 2 × 106/ml. The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed in cold PBS, and incubated in fixation-stopping solution (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.4) and 10 mm dithiothreitol). ChIP assay was performed as described previously (45Qin L. Liu Z. Chen H. Xu J. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 3819-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) by using antibodies against H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and Crem. 2 × 106 cells were used for each of H3K9Me1, H3K9Me2, and H3K9Me3 ChIP assays. 2 × 107 cells were used for each Crem ChIP assay. Eluted DNA samples were processed and subjected to PCR analyses of the proximal regions of Tnp1 and Odf1 gene promoters containing functional Crem-binding sites. In PCR, primers Tnp1-ChIP3F (gtccttttggctggtatgga) and Tnp1-ChIP3R (cttagccaaagctggtggag) were used to amplify fragment a. Primers Tnp1-ChIP2F (aatgaccacggctaaagcac) and Tnp1-ChIP2R (gccgggagtccatgtattta) were for fragment b amplification. Primers Odf1-ChIP5F (gggtctcaggggaccataac) and Odf1-ChIP5R (ctcttctcagaggcctccttt) were for fragment c amplification. Paraffin sections prepared from the testes of 10-week-old WT and Jmjd1a−/− mice were subjected to apoptosis analysis. The analysis was performed by using the ApopTag peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon). Digital images were recorded for each section. Two nonadjacent sections for each mouse and three mice per group were analyzed. For each section, the number of apoptotic cells in about 100 cross-sectioned seminiferous tubules was counted using the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, ImageTool software. The apoptotic cells were divided into three groups as follows: the pre-pachytene germ cells that attached to the basal membrane; the pachytene, diplotene, and secondary spermatocytes; and the spermatids. The mouse Jmjd1a gene spans about 43 kb and contains 26 exons that encode multiple alternative splicing variants. To inactivate the enzyme activity in all splicing isoforms, we constructed a gene-targeting vector containing a 6-kb 5′ arm from intron 12 to intron 16 and a 4.8-kb 3′ arm containing exon 26 (Fig. 1A). After electroporating the targeting vector DNA, we cultured ES cells in a selection medium with neomycin and 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil and then performed Southern blot to identify clones with correct homologous recombination. After the DNA samples were digested with XhoI and EcoRV restriction enzymes, the 5′ probe detected a 7.3-kb fragment from the targeted allele and a 10.9-kb fragment from the WT allele, whereas the 3′ probe detected a 8.1-kb fragment from the targeted allele and a 11.4-kb fragment from the WT allele (Fig. 1, A and B). Further Southern blot analysis using a neo probe confirmed that the genome of all three targeted clones had no detectable random insertion of the vector DNA, indicating that only the Jmjd1a allele is mutated in these clones (data not shown). Because the deleted region in the targeted allele contains exons 17–25 for the demethylase domain of Jmjd1a, the targeted Jmjd1a"
https://openalex.org/W2048789388,"Background Sepsis likely contributes to the high burden of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in low income countries. Data regarding sepsis management in sub-Saharan Africa are limited. We conducted a prospective observational study reporting the management and outcomes of severely septic patients in two Ugandan hospitals. We describe their epidemiology, management, and clinical correlates for mortality. Methodology/Results Three-hundred eighty-two patients fulfilled enrollment criteria for a severe sepsis syndrome. Vital signs, management and laboratory results were recorded. Outcomes measured included in-hospital and post-discharge mortality. Most patients were HIV-infected (320/377, 84.9%) with a median CD4+ T cell (CD4) count of 52 cells/mm3 (IQR, 16–131 cells/mm3). Overall mortality was 43.0%, with 23.7% in-hospital mortality (90/380) and 22.3% post-discharge mortality (55/247). Significant predictors of in-hospital mortality included admission Glasgow Coma Scale and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), tachypnea, leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Discharge KPS and early fluid resuscitation were significant predictors of post-discharge mortality. Among HIV-infected patients, CD4 count was a significant predictor of post-discharge mortality. Median volume of fluid resuscitation within the first 6 hours of presentation was 500 mLs (IQR 250–1000 mls). Fifty-two different empiric antibacterial regimens were used during the study. Bacteremic patients were more likely to die in hospital than non-bacteremic patients (OR 1.83, 95% CI = 1.01–3.33). Patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteremia (25/249) had higher in-hospital mortality (OR 1.97, 95% CI = 1.19–327) and lower median CD4 counts (p = 0.001) than patients without MTB bacteremia. Conclusion Patients presenting with sepsis syndromes to two Ugandan hospitals had late stage HIV infection and high mortality. Bacteremia, especially from MTB, was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Most clinical predictors of in-hospital mortality were easily measurable and can be used for triaging patients in resource-constrained settings. Procurement of low cost and high impact treatments like intravenous fluids and empiric antibiotics may help decrease sepsis-associated mortality in resource-constrained settings."
https://openalex.org/W2021307858,"Background Persistent symptoms, mainly joint and muscular pain and depression, have been reported several months after Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. Their frequency and their impact on quality of life have not been compared with those of an unexposed population. In the present study, we aimed to describe the frequency of prolonged clinical manifestations of CHIKV infection and to measure the impact on quality of life and health care consumption in comparison with that of an unexposed population, more than one year after infection. Methodology/Principal Findings In a retrospective cohort study, 199 subjects who had serologically confirmed CHIKV infection (CHIK+) were compared with 199 sero-negative subjects (CHIK–) matched for age, gender and area of residence in La Réunion Island. Following an average time of 17 months from the acute phase of infection, participants were interviewed by telephone about current symptoms, medical consumption during the last 12 months and quality of life assessed by the 12-items Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) scale. At the time of study, 112 (56%) CHIK+ persons reported they were fully recovered. CHIK+ complained more frequently than CHIK– of arthralgia (relative risk = 1.9; 95% confidence interval: 1.6–2.2), myalgia (1.9; 1.5–2.3), fatigue (2.3; 1.8–3), depression (2.5; 1.5–4.1) and hair loss (3.8; 1.9–7.6). There was no significant difference between CHIK+ and CHIK– subjects regarding medical consumption in the past year. The mean (SD) score of the SF-12 Physical Component Summary was 46.4 (10.8) in CHIK+ versus 49.1 (9.3) in CHIK– (p = 0.04). There was no significant difference between the two groups for the Mental Component Summary. Conclusions/Significance More than one year following the acute phase of infection, CHIK+ subjects reported more disabilities than those who were CHIK–. These persistent disabilities, however, have no significant influence on medical consumption, and the impact on quality of life is moderate."

En1 and En2 are partially redundant as shown by normal midbrain phenotype in the En2 knockout or the knockin of En2 into En1 (Hanks et al., 1995Hanks M. Wurst W. Anson-Cartwright L. Auerbach A.B.

Hanks The engrailed genes: evolution and function.Seminar in Developmental Biology. 1991; 2: 736-741Google Scholar). When En1 or En2 (collectively, Engrailed or En1/2) are ectopically expressed in the tectum, temporal axons avoid these areas, whereas nasal axons tend to terminate in them (Friedman and O'Leary, 1996Friedman G.C.

EphrinA upregulation at ectopic En1/2 sites supports the view that En1/2 control rostrocaudal patterning by regulating the graded expression of cell surface molecules (Logan et al., 1996Logan C. Wizenmann A. Drescher U. Monschau B. Bonhoeffer F. Lumsden A. Rostral optic tectum acquires caudal characteristics following ectopic engrailed expression.Curr.

Attraction of nasal axons to the ectopic En1/2 sites, once puzzling given the in vitro evidence that EphrinA repels axons, could be explained by more recent studies showing that EphrinA promotes axon growth in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro (Hansen et al., 2004Hansen M.J.

Other possibilities include unidentified attractants and/or Engrailed itself playing a direct role in attracting nasal axons. The possibility that Engrailed itself plays a direct role is suggested by studies showing that an external gradient of soluble En2 attracts nasal axons and repels temporal axons (Brunet et al., 2005Brunet I. Weinl C. Piper M. Trembleau A. Volovitch M. Harris W. Prochiantz A. Holt C. The transcription factor Engrailed-2 guides retinal axons.Nature. 2005; 438: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to test whether En plays an extracellular role in map formation. Furthermore, Engrailed proteins can be secreted and internalized in vitro and are associated with vesicles in the SC (Joliot and Prochiantz, 2004Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Transduction peptides: from technology to physiology.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, Joliot et al., 1997Joliot A. Trembleau A. Raposo G. Calvet S. Volovitch M. Prochiantz A. Association of Engrailed homeoproteins with vesicles presenting caveolae-like properties.Development. 1997; 124: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as shown for Pax6 in the eye anlagen (Lesaffre et al., 2007Lesaffre B. Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Volovitch M. Direct non-cell autonomous Pax6 activity regulates eye development in the zebrafish.Neural Develop. 2007; 2: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Otx2 in the visual cortex (Sugiyama et al., 2008Sugiyama S. Di Nardo A.A. Aizawa S. Matsuo I. Volovitch M. Prochiantz A. Hensch T.K. Experience-dependent transfer of Otx2 homeoprotein into the visual cortex activates postnatal plasticity.Cell. 2008; 134: 508-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), En1/2 could have non-cell-autonomous activities in the optic tectum. The data presented support this hypothesis and indicate that extracellular Engrailed contributes to map formation possibly via a mechanism that adjusts the sensitivity of axons to EphrinAs. We first asked whether En1/2 associate with tectal cell membranes. Nuclear and membrane fractions were prepared from E9 chick tecta, and En1/2 were found in the two fractions (Figure 1A). The absence of cross-contamination between the two fractions was verified using the nuclear marker RNA polymerase II (Pol-II) and the membrane marker GM130 (Nakamura et al., 1997Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. The vesicle docking protein p115 binds GM130, a cis-Golgi matrix protein, in a mitotically regulated manner.Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). By separating the most anterior (A) and posterior (P) domains of the tectum, we found that the low/anterior-high/posterior Engrailed nuclear gradient is preserved in the membranes (Figure 1A). The equal presence of β-actin and of a contaminant HSC70 extracellular isoform migrating between En1 and En2 indicates that similar amounts of proteins were loaded on A and P lanes. To investigate whether membranous En1/2 are localized outside of the cells, extracellular proteins from E9 anterior (A), median (M), and posterior (P) domains of chick tectum in flat-mount primary culture were labeled with biotin. Biotinylated proteins were purified on streptavidin columns and identified by western blot. Figure 1B illustrates that a fraction of En1 and En2 is accessible to biotin, thus extracellular, and shows graded expression. Based on band intensities (Figure 1B, left panel), the percentage of extracellular Engrailed was evaluated to around 5% of total Engrailed. To further verify En1/2 extracellular localization, tissues were treated with proteinase K before biotinylation. Figure 1B (lower panel) demonstrates that this treatment does not affect intracellular proteins (RhoA) but fully degrades NCAM. It also shows that biotinylation only affects extracellular (proteinase K sensitive) proteins (biotinylated En1/2 and NCAM but not RhoA). To verify the in vivo expression of extracellular En1/2, we used nonpermeabilized conditions for immunostaining on whole-mount Xenopus tecta with antibodies against En1/2 and the extracellular domain of NCAM. In these conditions, tecta showed positive immunostaining for Engrailed and NCAM. As illustrated and quantified in Figure 1C, En1/2 expression is graded, whereas NCAM staining is more evenly distributed. Indeed, the En1/2 fluorescent signal is 1.6 times higher in the posterior tectum than in the anterior with only a modest increase (1.1) in NCAM. En1/2 and NCAM exhibit a characteristic extracellular staining pattern nonoverlapping with the DAPI-stained nuclei (Figure 1C). Control experiments using an antibody against the intracellular protein, RhoA (Figure S1), demonstrate that permeabilized conditions produce strong RhoA cytoplasmic immunostaining that is uniformly expressed in the tectum (Figures S1A, S1C, and S1E). By contrast, nonpermeabilized conditions produce little RhoA immunostaining, although occasional, possibly damaged, cells are stained (Figures S1B, S1D, and S1F). Taken together, these results demonstrate that a fraction of En1/2 is extracellular, tethered to the membranes, with a posterior-to-anterior expression that parallels that of nuclear En1/2. To investigate whether extracellular Engrailed plays a role in retinal axon mapping in the tectum in vivo, we expressed single-chain antibodies to disrupt En1/2 nonautonomous activity in Xenopus. This approach was developed to block Pax6 nonautonomous activity in the zebrafish (Lesaffre et al., 2007Lesaffre B. Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Volovitch M. Direct non-cell autonomous Pax6 activity regulates eye development in the zebrafish.Neural Develop. 2007; 2: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and consists of the expression of genetically encoded secreted single-chain antihomeoprotein antibodies. Engrailed 4G11 single-chain antibody, which recognizes En1 and En2, was cloned with or without a signal peptide (SP) for secretion (Lesaffre et al., 2007Lesaffre B. Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Volovitch M. Direct non-cell autonomous Pax6 activity regulates eye development in the zebrafish.Neural Develop. 2007; 2: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The secreted and nonsecreted anti-En1/2 single-chain antibodies (SPsc4G11 and sc4G11, respectively) were tested for their specificity (Figure S2A), cellular localization (Figures S2B and S2D), association with Engrailed when expressed in vivo (Figure S2C), and ability to interfere with Engrailed transfer between cells (Figures S2E and S2F). When expressed by HEK cells, SPsc4G11 remains in the secretion pathway and does not reach the nucleus (Figure S2D), and 2 days later almost all of the antibody is extracellular (Figure S2B). Furthermore, SPsc4G11 in the culture medium decreases En2 intercellular transfer in vitro even in high En2 expression conditions (Figures S2E and S2F). In contrast, sc4G11 is not secreted (Figure S2B) and does not modify En secretion (data not shown). Embryonic tecta were electroporated with single-chain antibody constructs at stages 28–32, after tectal polarity is established and 10–12 hr before the first retinal axons reach the tectum. Single-chain antibody expression was verified by myc-immunostaining (Figure S3A). At stages 43–45, the fluorescent lipophilic dyes, DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) and DiO (3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate; Molecular Probes), were injected into the temporal and nasal parts of the retina, respectively, and the labeled axon terminals subsequently visualized in whole-mounted brains (Figure 2). Each DiI/DiO injection yielded approximately three to eight labeled axons in the tectum. At these early stages of development, nasal and temporal axons overlap in the anterior-to-middle regions of the tectum, since both populations of axons enter the tectum anteriorly and course together to posterior destinations. A clear A-P separation between the two sets of axons is evident posteriorly where nasal axons extend 10–25 μm beyond temporal axons. The midbrain/hindbrain boundary, the isthmus, was taken as a stable landmark, and the distance between it and the posterior-most tips of temporal (X) and nasal (Y) retinal axons was measured (Figure 2A). This gave an X/Y ratio that could be compared across samples. In control samples, the X/Y ratio was greater than 1 (1.2–1.3), reflecting the lower axon-to-isthmus value of the more posterior-reaching nasal axons (Y). Following SPsc4G11 expression, many temporal axons extended aberrantly into posterior territories, overlapping almost completely with nasal axons, and giving an X/Y ratio close to 1 (Figure 2). By contrast, when tecta were transfected with sc4G11, the X/Y ratio was 1.3, signifying normal A-P separation. Therefore, the effect of SPsc4G11 is likely through its secreted function. Expression of secreted or nonsecreted single-chain anti-Pax6 antibodies (Figures 2B and 2C) showed control X/Y values of 1.2–1.3, indicating that the SPsc4G11 result is not due to nonspecificity associated with the experimental approach. Although SPsc4G11 does not escape the secretion pathway (Figure S2D) to reach the nucleus, it could be that undetectable amounts do so, neutralizing a sufficient percentage of nuclear En1/2 to downregulate EphrinA expression. This is unlikely, since single-chain antibodies are often inactive within cells, as the reductive intracellular milieu disrupts the disulfide bounds necessary for antigen recognition (Auf der Maur et al., 2004Auf der Maur A. Tissot K. Barberis A. Antigen-independent selection of intracellular stable antibody frameworks.Methods. 2004; 34: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Strube and Chen, 2004Strube R.W. Chen S.Y. Enhanced intracellular stability of sFv-Fc fusion intrabodies.Methods. 2004; 34: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To verify the absence of cell-autonomous activity, SPsc4G11 and sc4G11 were electroporated into the Xenopus tectum, and EphrinA expression was visualized using EphA3-Fc (Cheng et al., 1995Cheng H.J. Nakamoto M. Bergemann A.D. Flanagan J.G. Complementary gradients in expression and binding of ELF-1 and Mek4 in development of the topographic retinotectal projection map.Cell. 1995; 82: 371-381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Quantitative fluorescence analysis showed that although the average levels of EphrinA signal intensity showed a slight decline from wild-type, the values did not differ significantly from controls (Figures S3A and S3B), and the graded patterns of expression were not modified (Figures S3C and S3D). Since the amount of secreted antibody that escapes the secretion pathway, if any, is undetectable compared to that of the nonsecreted antibody (Figure S2), it is likely that the effects of SPsc4G11 on retinotectal mapping are non-cell-autonomous. The mechanism of topographic mapping in the visual system exhibits major differences between species (Dutting and Meyer, 1995Dutting D. Meyer S.U.

Dev. 1998; 74: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In Xenopus and fish, where the embryonic optic tectum is very small (250 μm A-P) at the time of initial innervation, axons grow directly to their correct destinations. In chick and mammals, with a tectum about ten times larger (2200 μm A-P), axons initially bypass their correct targets and later form interstitial branches in the correct location (O'Leary and McLaughlin, 2005O'Leary D.D. McLaughlin T. Mechanisms of retinotopic map development: Ephs, ephrins, and spontaneous correlated retinal activity.Prog. Brain Res. 2005; 147: 43-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, overshooting of axons is less pronounced in chick (Dutting and Meyer, 1995Dutting D. Meyer S.U. Transplantations of the chick eye anlage reveal an early determination of nasotemporal polarity.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 921-931PubMed Google Scholar, Mueller et al., 1998Mueller B.K. Dutting D.

Dev. 1998; 74: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In chick, tectal innervation takes place between E6 and E12. We thus electroporated chick midbrain at E4 with plasmids encoding SPsc4G11, sc4G11, or SPscPax6. Efficiency and site of expression were verified with GFP plasmid coelectroporation. Insertion of a DiI crystal into the most posterior visible part of the tectum at E11 retrogradely labeled retinal axons. The animals were fixed at E12, and the distributions of labeled retinal ganglion cells in retina whole mounts were compared. Experiments where the crystal was in the midregion of the tectum or where the GFP did not reach the posterior region of the DiI crystal were discarded. In Figure 3A, the camera lucida drawings illustrate that SPsc4G11 induces more temporal RGCs to project into the posterior tectum than the other control conditions. This effect was quantified, showing an ∼6-fold increase in the number of temporal axons projecting to the posterior tectum (Figure 3B). As in Xenopus, SPscPax6 and sc4G11 antibodies had no effect on temporal axons (Figure 3B). To verify the absence of non-cell-autonomous antibody activity, the expression of SPsc4G11, EphrinA2/5, and Pax7 was compared by RT-PCR in the SPsc4G11 electroporated and nonelectroporated sides of the tectum. As shown in Figure 3C, the expression of the antibody led to no significant modification in Ephrin-A2/5 or Pax7 expression. Finally, mRNA in situ hybridization experiments further illustrated the absence of effect of nonsecreted and secreted single-chain 4G11 on EphrinA2/5 or En1/2 expression at E3 (Figure 3D). This series of experiments demonstrates that, also in the chick, axons from the temporal retina aberrantly invade the posterior tectum when extracellular Engrailed activity is disrupted. When grown on alternating lanes of anterior/posterior tectal membranes, temporal axons extend preferentially on anterior membranes, exhibiting “striped outgrowth,” due to the repellent activity of EphrinAs in the posterior membranes (Walter et al., 1987aWalter J. Henke-Fahle S. Bonhoeffer F. Avoidance of posterior tectal membranes by temporal retinal axons.Development. 1987; 101: 909-913PubMed Google Scholar). Since the neutralization of extracellular Engrailed causes mapping errors, we asked whether En1/2 also contributes repellent activity to posterior membranes. Striped carpets from anterior and posterior chick tectum membranes were produced (Walter et al., 1987aWalter J. Henke-Fahle S. Bonhoeffer F. Avoidance of posterior tectal membranes by temporal retinal axons.Development. 1987; 101: 909-913PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of Engrailed protein was probed with two anti-engrailed antibodies (Figures 4A and 4B). Engrailed signal was high in the posterior membrane lanes and low in the anterior lanes, similar to that of EphrinA2 (Figures 4A–4C), confirming our biochemical data (Figure 1). Next, nasal and temporal strips of E6 chick retinas were placed perpendicular to the membrane stripes, and the outgrowth of the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons was scored 2 days later. As expected (Walter et al., 1987aWalter J. Henke-Fahle S. Bonhoeffer F. Avoidance of posterior tectal membranes by temporal retinal axons.Development. 1987; 101: 909-913PubMed Google Scholar, Yates et al., 2001Yates P.A. Roskies A.L. McLaughlin T. O'Leary D.D. Topographic-specific axon branching controlled by ephrin-As is the critical event in retinotectal map development.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8548-8563PubMed Google Scholar), temporal fibers grew preferentially on membranes from anterior tectum (Figure 4D), whereas nasal fibers grew randomly on anterior and posterior membranes (data not shown). To investigate a putative En1/2 role, we used specific blocking antibodies. Posterior membranes were incubated with one polyclonal (86.9 [Sonnier et al., 2007Sonnier L. Le Pen G. Hartmann A. Bizot J.C. Trovero F. Krebs M.O. Prochiantz A. Progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain of adult mice heterozygote for Engrailed1.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar]) and two monoclonal (4D9 and 4G11) antibodies against En1/2 proteins or with a control antibody to Otx2 prior to preparing the membrane carpets. Growth preferences were evaluated blindly by two independent observers (A.W. and L.S.) using a scoring system ranging from 3 for a very strong preference to 0 for no preference for anterior membranes. Blocking En1/2 activity with any of the three anti-Engrailed antibodies reduced temporal repulsion (Figures 4E and 4H). Axons still showed a preference for anterior membranes, but the striped pattern was “blurred” due to axons straying into posterior membrane lanes (Figure 4E). Indeed, the overall preference of temporal axons for anterior membranes was reduced to an average score between 1 and 1.7 compared to 3 for wild-type (Figure 4H). The activity of the 4D9 antibody was neutralized by preincubation with the Engrailed homeodomain, which contains the epitope recognized by this antibody but has no activity per se (Brunet et al., 2005Brunet I. Weinl C. Piper M. Trembleau A. Volovitch M. Harris W. Prochiantz A. Holt C. The transcription factor Engrailed-2 guides retinal axons.Nature. 2005; 438: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Otx2 (Figures 4G and 4H) or Pax6 (data not shown) did not change the preference of temporal axons for anterior membranes, although Otx2 is also present in the membrane fractions (data not shown). To further test whether extracellular Engrailed influences temporal axon choice, we used membranes derived from the SC of newborn En1−/− mutant mice (Wurst et al., 1994Wurst W. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Multiple developmental defects in Engrailed-1 mutant mice: an early mid- hindbrain deletion and patterning defects in forelimbs and sternum.Development. 1994; 120: 2065-2075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). En1 is absent and En2 protein is severely reduced in these mice (Figure S4A). We found that En1−/− posterior tectal membranes lost most of their ability to repel temporal axons (Figures S4A and S4B) despite the continued (although reduced) expression of EphrinA2/A5 at the mRNA and protein levels (Figure S4C). Quantification of repulsion (blind observation, two independent observers) is shown in Figure S4B. An explanation is that Ephrin concentrations in the mutant are reduced to levels not allowing temporal growth cone repulsion. However, in the light of our results supporting a direct nonautonomous activity of En1/2, it is also possible that the sensitivity of temporal growth cones to Ephrins is reduced at low"

Biophysical and physiological studies have indicated diverse functions for Complexins in vesicle fusion, some of which are incompatible (Brose, 2008Brose N. For better or for worse: complexins regulate SNARE function and vesicle fusion.Traffic. 2008; 9: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Complexins have been shown to inhibit SNARE-mediated cell fusion (Giraudo et al., 2006Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E. A clamping mechanism involved in SNARE-dependent exocytosis.Science. 2006; 313: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and proteoliposome fusion in bulk ensemble assay (Schaub et al., 2006Schaub J.R. Lu X. Doneske B. Shin Y.K. McNew J.A. Hemifusion arrest by complexin is relieved by Ca(2+)-synaptotagmin I.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 748-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and this inhibition is released by the Ca2+ sensor Synaptotagmin-1 and Ca2+. Biochemically, Synaptotagmin-1 competes with Complexins for the SNARE complex binding and displaces Complexins from the SNARE complex in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Tang et al., 2006Tang J. Maximov A. Shin O.H. Dai H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C.

These studies suggest a fusion clamp model for Complexin function, in which Complexins inhibit the transfer of the force generated by the SNARE complex assembly onto the fusing membranes and arrest synaptic vesicle fusion before Ca2+ influx. Upon Ca2+ binding, Synaptotagmin-1 displaces Complexins from the SNARE complex to release this inhibition and triggers exocytosis (Giraudo et al., 2006Giraudo C.G. Eng W.S. Melia T.J. Rothman J.E.

However, Complexins have also been shown to stimulate proteoliposome fusion in both single-vesicle fusion assay (Yoon et al., 2008Yoon T.Y. Lu X. Diao J. Lee S.M. Ha T. Shin Y.K. Complexin and Ca2+ stimulate SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and bulk ensemble assay (Malsam et al., 2009Malsam J.

USA. 2009; 106: 2001-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), indicating a facilitatory role. These in vitro results are further confounded by in vivo genetic studies. Genetic knockout of Complexins in mice leads to a reduction in both evoked and spontaneous release at multiple glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in cultures and in acute brain slices (Reim et al., 2001Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C.

Tapechum S. Hill K. Sorensen J.B. Brose N. Chow R.H. Complexin II plays a positive role in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis by facilitating vesicle priming.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 19538-19543Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), supporting a stimulatory function for Complexins. In contrast, genetic deletion of Complexin in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster greatly enhances spontaneous release but decreases Ca2+-evoked release (Huntwork and Littleton, 2007Huntwork S. Littleton J.T. A complexin fusion clamp regulates spontaneous neurotransmitter release and synaptic growth.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1235-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), favoring the fusion clamp model. Moreover, knockdown of Complexins by RNA interference in mass-cultured mouse cortical neurons decreases evoked release and increases spontaneous release at glutamatergic synapses (Maximov et al., 2009Maximov A. Tang J. Yang X. Pang Z.P. Sudhof T.C. Complexin Controls the Force Transfer from SNARE Complexes to Membranes in Fusion.Science. 2009; 323: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To explain the discrepancy between this result and those obtained previously from Complexin knockout mice, the authors (Maximov et al., 2009Maximov A. Tang J. Yang X. Pang Z.P. Sudhof T.C. Complexin Controls the Force Transfer from SNARE Complexes to Membranes in Fusion.Science. 2009; 323: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) suggest that this is due to the different preparations used (autaptic cultures for knockout studies [Reim et al., 2001Reim K. Mansour M. Varoqueaux F. McMahon H.T. Sudhof T.C. Brose N. Rosenmund C.

Complexin Controls the Force Transfer from SNARE Complexes to Membranes in Fusion.Science. 2009; 323: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar]), disavowing the fact that the knockout studies also employed mass cultures and acute brain slices (Xue et al., 2008bXue M. Stradomska A. Chen H. Brose N. Zhang W. Rosenmund C. Reim K. Complexins facilitate neurotransmitter release at excitatory and inhibitory synapses in mammalian central nervous system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 7875-7880Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and found similar results to those obtained from autaptic cultures. Hence, many studies seem at odds with each other and the precise in vivo role of Complexins in exocytosis is still unclear. An in vivo structure-function analysis of murine Complexin I (CplxI) in Complexin I/II double knockout mouse neurons indicates that the SNARE complex binding is essential for CplxI function, and that the N terminus of CplxI facilitates release, whereas an accessory α helix between the N terminus and the central α helix inhibits release (Xue et al., 2007Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Distinct domains of complexin I differentially regulate neurotransmitter release.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A biophysical study reveals that CplxI inhibits SNARE complex formation, but strongly stimulates membrane fusion after the assembly of the SNARE complex in vitro (Yoon et al., 2008Yoon T.Y. Lu X. Diao J. Lee S.M. Ha T. Shin Y.K. Complexin and Ca2+ stimulate SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that Complexins play both facilitatory and inhibitory roles in exocytosis, but they still do not explain why genetic deletions of Complexins in two model organisms, mouse and fly, have such different effects on neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence homology is low between murine and Drosophila Complexins except for the central α helix that is essential for the binding to the SNARE complex, and part of the N terminus (Figure S1 available online; Huntwork and Littleton, 2007Huntwork S. Littleton J.T. A complexin fusion clamp regulates spontaneous neurotransmitter release and synaptic growth.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1235-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Reim et al., 2005Reim K. Wegmeyer H. Brandstatter J.H. Xue M. Rosenmund C. Dresbach T. Hofmann K. Brose N. Structurally and functionally unique complexins at retinal ribbon synapses.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the dramatic difference in loss-of-function phenotypes of Complexin-deficient mice and flies leads to the conclusion that Complexin function must differ between mice and flies. To test whether the functions of murine and Drosophila Complexins are conserved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and to gain insight into their functional and structural differences, it is essential to compare murine and Drosophila Complexins in the same experimental in vivo systems. A detailed structure-function analysis is also necessary because a complete removal of Complexins is unlikely to reveal all aspects of their function (Xue et al., 2007Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Distinct domains of complexin I differentially regulate neurotransmitter release.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore undertook a systematic cross-species rescue approach to compare the functions of murine and Drosophila Complexins at both mouse and fly synapses. We find that both murine and Drosophila Complexins contain distinct functional domains and play dual roles in neurotransmitter release. They facilitate and inhibit release via similar domains, but the facilitatory or inhibitory strength of a given domain varies between murine and Drosophila Complexins. Thus, both murine and Drosophila Complexins utilize conserved mechanisms in release process, but the integration of facilitation and inhibition differs substantially between them, leading to an apparently opposite overall effect on exocytosis. Our results reveal conserved functions of Complexins between species and indicate that the interplay of dual functions orchestrates neurotransmitter release. Prior to examining Complexin function at mouse synapses, we assessed Complexin protein localization by immunostaining and confocal micrscopy. The antibodies against Drosophila Complexin (dmCplx) or CplxI show some nonspecific labeling in immunostaining of mouse neurons; we therefore generated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged dmCplx and CplxI. We transfected cultured hippocampal neurons with EGFP-dmCplx and EGFP-CplxI, and immunolabeled the neurons with antibodies against EGFP and a presynaptic marker, vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (Vglut-1). EGFP-CplxI is distributed diffusely in axonal processes and synapses (Figure 1A), consistent with previous subcellular localization studies (McMahon et al., 1995McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Complexins: cytosolic proteins that regulate SNAP receptor function.Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, Reim et al., 2005Reim K. Wegmeyer H. Brandstatter J.H. Xue M. Rosenmund C. Dresbach T. Hofmann K. Brose N. Structurally and functionally unique complexins at retinal ribbon synapses.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In contrast, EGFP-dmCplx shows a punctate pattern along axons and is enriched at presynaptic varicosities (Figure 1A). The synaptic localization of EGFP-dmCplx is similar to the punctate distribution of murine CplxIII and CplxIV, which is mediated by farnesylation of their C termini (Reim et al., 2005Reim K. Wegmeyer H. Brandstatter J.H. Xue M. Rosenmund C. Dresbach T. Hofmann K. Brose N. Structurally and functionally unique complexins at retinal ribbon synapses.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar; and see below). Nevertheless, both EGFP-dmCplx and EGFP-CplxI are present at presynaptic termini that are labeled by Vglut-1, indicating that both CplxI and dmCplx reach synapses in mouse neurons (Figure 1A). To study the effect of dmCplx in neurotransmitter release, we used lentiviruses to express wild-type (WT) dmCplx and CplxI at similar levels in cultured hippocampal neurons (Supplemental Results and Figure S2). Autaptic Complexin I/II/III triple knockout (Cplx-TKO) neurons were infected with lentiviruses expressing CplxI or dmCplx together with EGFP, or with lentiviruses only expressing EGFP. In response to an action potential, the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude of Cplx-TKO neurons is severely reduced, and this defect is fully rescued by the expression of CplxI (Figures 1B and 1D; Xue et al., 2007Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Distinct domains of complexin I differentially regulate neurotransmitter release.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Strikingly, expression of dmCplx in Cplx-TKO neurons almost abolishes the remaining evoked release (Figures 1B and 1D), showing that CplxI and dmCplx affect synaptic transmission in opposite ways in vivo. To directly assess the Ca2+-triggered release efficacy, we determined the vesicular release probability (Pvr), the fraction of the readily releasable vesicles released by one action potential. We measured readily releasable vesicle pool (RRP) by hypertonic sucrose solution (Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Definition of the readily releasable pool of vesicles at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) and Pvr was calculated as the ratio of evoked EPSC charge and RRP charge. Expression of CplxI fully rescues the decreased Pvr of Cplx-TKO neurons (Figure 1F; Xue et al., 2007Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Distinct domains of complexin I differentially regulate neurotransmitter release.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whereas dmCplx reduces the Pvr by more than 98% compared to Cplx-TKO neurons (Figure 1F). The numbers of fusion-competent vesicles in RRP are not significantly different among the three groups (Figure 1E, p = 0.8). Furthermore, expression of CplxI rescues the decreased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency of Cplx-TKO neurons, in contrast to dmCplx, which suppresses the mEPSC frequency by more than 96% in Cplx-TKO neurons (Figures 1C and 1G). The inhibitory effect of dmCplx is not restricted to hippocampal glutamatergic autapses, as it also inhibits release in striatal GABAergic autaptic neurons (Figure S3) and in hippocampal mass-cultured neurons (Figure S4). In summary, these data show that CplxI facilitates both evoked and spontaneous release, and that dmCplx practically abolishes evoked and spontaneous release in mouse neurons without affecting the number of fusion-competent vesicles. Thus, these results are in agreement with the proposed functions for murine and Drosophila Complexins based on genetic loss-of-function studies (Huntwork and Littleton, 2007Huntwork S. Littleton J.T. A complexin fusion clamp regulates spontaneous neurotransmitter release and synaptic growth.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1235-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, Xue et al., 2008bXue M. Stradomska A. Chen H. Brose N. Zhang W. Rosenmund C. Reim K. Complexins facilitate neurotransmitter release at excitatory and inhibitory synapses in mammalian central nervous system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 7875-7880Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Expression of dmCplx in Cplx-TKO hippocampal neurons blocks both evoked and spontaneous release, whereas CplxI rescues the reduced evoked and spontaneous release of Cplx-TKO neurons (Figure 1). Previous studies showed that greater than 10-fold overexpression of CplxI by Semliki Forest viruses in WT hippocampal neurons does not alter neurotransmitter release, indicating that CplxI does not act as a fusion clamp (Xue et al., 2007Xue M. Reim K. Chen X. Chao H.T. Deng H. Rizo J. Brose N. Rosenmund C. Distinct domains of complexin I differentially regulate neurotransmitter release.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). If dmCplx functions as a fusion clamp, one would predict that overexpression of dmCplx in WT neurons should inhibit release. To test this hypothesis, we compared WT neurons overexpressing EGFP with those overexpressing dmCplx or CplxI together with EGFP (Figure 2). Consistent with previous results, lentiviral overexpression of CplxI in WT neurons does not significantly affect either evoked or spontaneous release (Figures 2A–2K, p > 0.05 for all tested parameters). In contrast, overexpression of dmCplx at levels similar to those of CplxI (Supplemental Results and Figure S2) strongly suppresses EPSC amplitude (Figures 2A and 2C) without affecting the RRP size (Figure 2D). Consequently, the Pvr of evoked release is drastically reduced in WT neurons overexpressing dmCplx (Figure 2E). Consistent with the reduction in Pvr, overexpression of dmCplx alters the short-term synaptic plasticity of WT neurons, from mild depression to strong facilitation during repetitive high-frequency stimulations (Figures 2B, 2F, and 2G). These results indicate that WT neurons overexpressing dmCplx are less sensitive to Ca2+. To test this, we measured evoked EPSC amplitudes as a function of the external Ca2+ concentrations and fitted the data with a standard Hill equation to obtain the dissociation constant (Kd) as a measure of the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of release. WT neurons overexpressing dmCplx show a greater than 2-fold increase in Kd compared to WT neurons, indicating that overexpression of dmCplx decreases the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of release (Figure 2H). Finally, we examined the spontaneous release and found that overexpression of dmCplx markedly reduces the mEPSC frequency (Figures 2I and 2J), but barely affects mEPSC amplitude (Figure 2K). Overexpression of dmCplx does not completely suppress evoked and spontaneous release in WT neurons, presumably because the endogenous murine Complexins compete with dmCplx for the SNARE complex binding and still participate in release. Altogether, these data are consistent with the rescue experiments and show that dmCplx mainly acts as a fusion inhibitor. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the apparently opposite roles of murine and Drosophila Complexins in synaptic exocytosis, we performed a structure-function analysis of Complexins by mutagenesis and chimeric analyses. We used Cplx-TKO neurons expressing EGFP as controls to measure the baseline release. We then rescued Cplx-TKO neurons with different Cplx variants (deletions, point mutations, or chimeric proteins) together with EGFP to assess whether a Cplx variant facilitates or inhibits neurotransmitter release. We used Pvr and mEPSC frequency as two main parameters to examine evoked and spontaneous release efficacy, respectively. Pvr and mEPSC frequency data were normalized to the mean values of the corresponding Cplx-TKO control neurons (red dashed lines and error bars in Figure 3) to allow comparisons of different Cplx variants across different experiments. Data from all CplxI- or dmCplx-rescued Cplx-TKO neurons are pooled together and shown in Figure 3, because the normalized values do not significantly differ across experiments (p > 0.05). All of the Cplx variants studied in Figure 3, Figure 4 are properly expressed in neurons and targeted to the synapses (Supplemental Results and Figure S5).Figure 4The N Termini of Both Murine CplxI and Drosophila Cplx Facilitate Neurotransmitter ReleaseShow full caption(A) Representative traces of evoked EPSCs.

Therefore, we tested whether the SNARE complex binding is also required for dmCplx function. We confirmed that dmCplx binds to the murine SNARE complex in a cosedimentation assay (Figure S6).

https://openalex.org/W2067399742,"Background Alterations in the stem cell niche are likely to contribute to tumorigenesis; however, the concept of niche promoted benign tumor growth remains to be explored. Here we use keloid, an exuberant fibroproliferative dermal growth unique to human skin, as a model to characterize benign tumor-like stem cells and delineate the role of their “pathological” niche in the development of the benign tumor. Methods and Findings Subclonal assay, flow cytometric and multipotent differentiation analyses demonstrate that keloid contains a new population of stem cells, named keloid derived precursor cells (KPCs), which exhibit clonogenicity, self-renewal, distinct embryonic and mesenchymal stem cell surface markers, and multipotent differentiation. KPCs display elevated telomerase activity and an inherently upregulated proliferation capability as compared to their peripheral normal skin counterparts. A robust elevation of IL-6 and IL-17 expression in keloid is confirmed by cytokine array, western blot and ELISA analyses. The altered biological functions are tightly regulated by the inflammatory niche mediated by an autocrine/paracrine cytokine IL-17/IL-6 axis. Utilizing KPCs transplanted subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice we generate for the first time a human keloid-like tumor model that is driven by the in vivo inflammatory niche and allows testing of the anti-tumor therapeutic effect of antibodies targeting distinct niche components, specifically IL-6 and IL-17. Conclusions/Significance These findings support our hypothesis that the altered niche in keloids, predominantly inflammatory, contributes to the acquirement of a benign tumor-like stem cell phenotype of KPCs characterized by the uncontrolled self-renewal and increased proliferation, supporting the rationale for in vivo modification of the “pathological” stem cell niche as a novel therapy for keloid and other mesenchymal benign tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2128117352,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent one of the most serious forms of DNA damage that can occur in the genome. Here, we show that the DSB-induced signaling cascade and homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DSB repair pathway can be genetically separated. We demonstrate that the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex acts to promote DNA end resection and the generation of single-stranded DNA, which is critically important for HR repair. These functions of the MRN complex can occur independently of the H2AX-mediated DNA damage signaling cascade, which promotes stable accumulation of other signaling and repair proteins such as 53BP1 and BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage. Nevertheless, mild defects in HR repair are observed in H2AX-deficient cells, suggesting that the H2AX-dependent DNA damage-signaling cascade assists DNA repair. We propose that the MRN complex is responsible for the initial recognition of DSBs and works together with both CtIP and the H2AX-dependent DNA damage-signaling cascade to facilitate repair by HR and regulate DNA damage checkpoints."

We therefore propose that the unconventional kinesin KIF26A plays a key role in enteric nervous system development by repressing a cell growth signaling pathway. The kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) have been shown to transport various membranous organelles and protein complexes in a microtubule- and ATP-dependent manner (Hirokawa and Noda, 2008Hirokawa N. Noda Y. Intracellular transport and kinesin superfamily proteins, KIFs: structure, function, and dynamics.Physiol.

A globular motor domain is present in all KIFs, exhibiting a high degree of homology and containing a microtubule-binding and an ATP-binding sequence. However, outside the motor domain, each KIF possesses a unique sequence. The diversity of these cargo-binding domains plays a role in the mechanisms of action, as well as binding regulation (Hirokawa and Takemura, 2005Hirokawa N. Takemura R. Molecular motors and mechanisms of directional transport in neurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). A total of 45 murine and human KIFs have been identified and classified into 14 large families—termed kinesin 1 to 14 (Miki et al., 2001Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Here, we identified Kinesin superfamily protein 26A (KIF26A), a new member of the KIFs belonging to the kinesin 11 subfamily (Miki et al., 2001Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). KIF26A has a divergent motor domain that exhibits microtubule-binding activity but lacks ATPase activity, which indicates a function other than cargo transport. To examine the role of KIF26A in vivo, we generated kif26a−/− mice. Quite unexpectedly, we found that these mice exhibited severe abnormalities in enteric nervous system (ENS) development. The ENS coordinates complex behaviors of the gastrointestinal tract. ENS neurons and glial cells are organized into ganglia, and these ganglia interconnect to form an enteric plexus. The coordinated activity of multiple neurons residing in numerous ganglia is required for normal ENS function. It has been established that glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) signaling regulates various aspects of ENS development through Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, such as survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of enteric neurons (Heanue and Pachnis, 2007Heanue T.A. Pachnis V. Enteric nervous system development and Hirschsprung's disease: advances in genetic and stem cell studies.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Mutations in molecular components of GDNF-Ret signaling result in ENS phenotypes in mutant mice, or in human genetic disorders, such as Hirschsprung's disease or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b (MEN2B) (Cacalano et al., 1998Cacalano G.

Defects in the kidney and enteric nervous system of mice lacking the tyrosine kinase receptor Ret.Nature. 1994; 367: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms controlling GDNF-Ret signaling in ENS development are incompletely understood. Here, we show that disruption of the kif26a gene led to increased numbers of enteric neurons, due to GDNF hyperresponsiveness, which resulted in disturbed bowel movement regulation and dilatation of the gastrointestinal tract. Mechanistically, we found that KIF26A directly binds and inhibits Grb2/SHC complex formation, thereby disrupting Ret tyrosine kinase activation and subsequent signaling of ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathways. These results suggest a function for KIF26A as a negative regulator of GDNF-Ret signaling in ENS development. On the basis of predicted sequences in Celera and public databases, PCR amplification of full-length KIF26A from mouse brain and testis libraries was performed to identify entire KIF26A sequences. To date, KIF26A homologs have only been found in vertebrates (Miki et al., 2001Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. All kinesin superfamily protein, KIF, genes in mouse and human.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). KIF26A comprises 1881 amino acids, and the predicted molecular weight is 196.3 kDa (NCBI [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/] accession number GQ489027). The motor domain is localized to the N terminus, and the coiled-coil domain is localized to the C terminus of the full sequence (Figure 1A). Amino acid comparisons demonstrated that motifs “EGYNG” and “IFAYGQT” (Miki et al., 2001Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. All kinesin superfamily protein, KIF, genes in mouse and human.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), as well as many amino acids essential for ATPase activity of KIFs, were not conserved in the KIF26A motor domain (Figure 1B) (Woehlke et al., 1997Woehlke G. Ruby A.K. Hart C.L. Ly B. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D. Microtubule interaction site of the kinesin motor.Cell. 1997; 90: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To determine ATPase activity of KIF26A, we performed an ATP-dependent microtubule-dissociating assay using purified motor domains of KIF26A (Kondo et al., 1994Kondo S. Sato-Yoshitake R. Noda Y. Aizawa H. Nakata T. Matsuura Y. Hirokawa N. KIF3A is a new microtubule-based anterograde motor in the nerve axon.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1095-1107Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C, first panel). In typical KIFs, such as KIF5A, the motor domain utilizes energy from the ATPase cycle to dissociate from microtubules (Nitta et al., 2004Nitta R. Kikkawa M. Okada Y. Hirokawa N. KIF1A alternately uses two loops to bind microtubules.Science. 2004; 305: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, Woehlke et al., 1997Woehlke G. Ruby A.K. Hart C.L. Ly B. Hom-Booher N. Vale R.D. Microtubule interaction site of the kinesin motor.Cell. 1997; 90: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, KIF26A binds continuously to microtubules (Figure 1C, second panel). Similar results were obtained in the present study using full-length KIF26A and KIF5A (Figure 1C, third panel). Flag-tagged KIF26A was eluted when the pellet was incubated with 1M NaCl, excluding the possibility that KIF26A formed irreversible aggregates with microtubules (Figure 1C, fourth panel). KIF26A properties are very similar to a rigor mutant of KIF5 that lacks microtubule-dependent ATPase activity (Nakata and Hirokawa, 1995Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Point mutation of adenosine triphosphate-binding motif generated rigor kinesin that selectively blocks anterograde lysosome membrane transport.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1039-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These results suggested that KIF26A binds to microtubules but lacks microtubule-based motility. To gain insight into the expression of kif26a gene, loxP-SA-IRES-βgeo-loxP was inserted into kif26a locus by homologous recombination (Figure S1A available online). Using kif26a3loxP/3loxP mice, we conducted LacZ staining in the brain, heart, lung, kidney, and colon at postnatal day 12 (P12). Strong expression was detected in substantia nigra in brain and enteric nervous system in colon at P12 (data not shown). To confirm the expression in wild-type (WT) background, we hybridized colon sections at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), E14.5, and P12 with digoxigenin-labeled kif26a probes and double-labeled them with anti-digoxigenin antibody and anti-PGP9.5 antibody (neuronal marker) (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1B). In colon sections at E12.5, E14.5, and P12, digoxigenin-positive signals colocalized well to PGP9.5-positive clusters observed in muscular and submucosal layer, which indicated exclusive ENS expression of the kif26a gene. Furthermore, KIF26A was also detected in dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord gray matter at E14.5 (Figures S1C and S1D). These data suggest that kif26a gene is expressed in several neuronal populations. To gain insight into the function of KIF26A in vivo, we generated kif26a−/− mice (Figure S1A). Mating of kif26a+/− mice from a C57BL/C background resulted in the expected Mendelian frequency of 22.7% kif26a−/− (25/110), 55.5% kif26a+/− (61/110), and 21.8% kif26a+/+ (24/110) mice, as confirmed by genomic PCR (Figure S1E, upper panels), RT-PCR with KIF26A-specific primers (Figure S1E, lower panel), and western blotting with anti-KIF26A antibody (Figure S1F). With kif26a−/− mice used as a negative control, KIF26A expression in the ENS was confirmed (Figures 1F and 1G). kif26a−/− mice exhibited growth retardation, became emaciated, and died within 5 weeks of birth. The median and mean life span of kif26a−/− mice was 15 and 16 days, respectively (range, 7–35 days) (Figure S1G). Macroscopic dissection revealed that kif26a−/− mice suffered from megacolon (Figure 2A), with dilation from the distal small intestine to the proximal colon. Severe occlusion was observed in the distal colon (Figure 2B). Considering expression patterns of kif26a in the developing and adult ENS, these effects suggested that a defect in ENS function might result in functional bowel obstruction. To assess colon contractile responses in kif26a−/− mice, we measured contraction force in the distal colons. Colon contractions are mediated by acetylcholine and can be induced by carbachol (CCh), a long-acting acetylcholine agonist. Consistent with an occluded distal colon, responses to CCh were prolonged in the kif26a−/− mouse colon, while the maximum contraction force was not significantly different between genotypes (Figure 2C). These data indicated that colon motility was not coordinated in kif26a−/− mice. Histological examinations of the colon were performed in kif26a−/− mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed hypertrophy of enteric ganglia (hyperganglionosis) in the colon (Figures 2D and 2E). The amount of protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5), a neuronal marker, was increased in the kif26a−/− mouse colon, possibly because of hyperganglionosis (Figure 2F). Because the myenteric plexus is composed of multiple types of neurons, further histochemical analysis was performed with two cell markers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase. AChE-positive cells and NADPH diaphorase-positive neurons are two major cell populations residing in the myenteric plexus (Heanue and Pachnis, 2007Heanue T.A. Pachnis V. Enteric nervous system development and Hirschsprung's disease: advances in genetic and stem cell studies.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The number of AChE- or NADPH diaphorase-positive cells, which were located in the red-colored region shown in Figure 2G, was quantified and compared. Both cell types were more abundant in the kif26a−/− samples, compared with the WT samples (Figures 2H–2K). Ganglia hypertrophy was clearly observed under high magnification in the kif26a−/− mouse distal colon (insets in Figure 2I). Differences between the genotypes were statistically significant (Figures 2L and 2M), but not in the kif26a−/− ileum (Figures S2A–S2F). The number of AChE- or NADPH diaphorase-positive cells was increased in the kif26a−/− proximal colon (Figures S2G–S2L). However, increased cell numbers in the kif26a−/− mouse bowels were more prominent in the distal colon (54.6% increase in the number of AChE-positive cells and 48.7% increase in the number of NADPH diaphorase-positive cells), compared with the proximal colon (26.8% increase in the number of AChE-positive cells and 22.6% increase in the number of NADPH diaphorase-positive cells). ENS precursor proliferation was evaluated in kif26a−/− mice. Because colonization of ENS precursors in colon occurs between E11.5 and E13.5 (Heanue and Pachnis, 2007Heanue T.A. Pachnis V. Enteric nervous system development and Hirschsprung's disease: advances in genetic and stem cell studies.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), mitotically active cell populations were labeled in WT and kif26a−/− embryonic bowels at E12.5 via a pulse injection of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Tissue sections were prepared and double stained with anti-BrdU and anti-PGP9.5 antibodies. The number of BrdU-positive cells in the PGP9.5-positive cell population was significantly increased in kif26a−/− mice, compared with the WT mice (Figures 2N–2P). These results indicated that the ENS precursor proliferation was abnormally increased in kif26a−/− mouse bowels. WT enteric ganglia were typically well interconnected by AChE- or NADPH diaphorase-positive fibers (arrows in Figures 3A and S2M), whereas kif26a−/− ganglia were less interconnected by these fibers (Figures 3B and S2N). These results suggested that kif26a−/− ganglia failed to establish normal neuronal networks in the colon. To examine possible morphological changes of kif26a−/− enteric neurons, we established dissociated primary cultures (Lin et al., 2003Lin Z. Sandgren K. Ekblad E. Increased expression of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in cultured myenteric neurons from adult rat small intestine.Auton. Neurosci. 2003; 107: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Enteric neurons dissociated from muscular layer of P12 colons were fixed at 3 days in vitro and double-labeled with anti-PGP9.5 and anti-smooth muscle actin antibodies to discriminate neurons from muscle cells (Figures 3C–3F). As a result, neurite length was shown to be significantly shorter in kif26a−/− enteric neurons, and the difference between WT and kif26a−/− neurite length was statistically significant (Figure 3G, 290 ± 14.6 μm and 106 ± 4.7 μm, mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], respectively; p < 0.001, t test). Because results in Figure 1C suggested that KIF26A associated with microtubules, microtubule stability was compared by immunocytochemistry with anti-acetylated-tubulin and anti-tyrosinated-tubulin antibodies. Results demonstrated reduced fluorescence intensity of acetylated tubulin, but increased tyrosinated tubulin, in the kif26a−/− growth cones (Figures 3H–3P), which suggested that microtubules were less stable in kif26a−/− enteric neurons than in WT neurons. Overexpression of KIF26A in COS cells resulted in altered microtubule networks and increased microtubule stability against nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing reagent (Figure S3), also suggesting that KIF26A exhibited microtubule-stabilizing activity. To assess the possibility that defects in other cell types contributed to the development of megacolon, we compared the morphology of other cells between genotypes (interstitial cells of Cajal in the colon and smooth muscle cells in culture). However, morphology of both cells, as well as Cajal cell density, remained unchanged in kif26a−/− mouse tissue or cultures (Figures S4A–S4E). Previous studies have demonstrated that inactivation of GDNF-Ret signaling results in aganglionosis of the myenteric plexus (Cacalano et al., 1998Cacalano G. Farinas I. Wang L.C. Hagler K. Forgie A.

Therefore, possible changes in GDNF-Ret signaling were examined in the kif26a−/− enteric neurons. Because Ras/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt are crucial downstream pathways (Segouffin-Cariou and Billaud, 2000Segouffin-Cariou C. Billaud M.

Enteric nervous system development and Hirschsprung's disease: advances in genetic and stem cell studies.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), the activity of these two signaling pathways was evaluated with two antibodies: anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) and anti-phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), respectively, as described previously (Taketomi et al., 2005Taketomi T. Yoshiga D. Taniguchi K. Kobayashi T. Nonami A. Kato R. Sasaki M. Sasaki A. Ishibashi H. Moriyama M. et al.Loss of mammalian Sprouty2 leads to enteric neuronal hyperplasia and esophageal achalasia.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Colon strips, prior to and after GDNF treatment, were fixed, processed for subsequent immunohistochemistry, and compared between the genotypes. Anti-βIII tubulin antibody was simultaneously used as a neuronal marker. As shown in Figures 4A and 4B, GDNF treatments abnormally increased pERK1/2 and pAkt levels in kif26a−/− enteric neurons, but pERK1/2 and pAkt levels remained unchanged in muscle cells (pERK1/2, Figure 4A; pAkt, Figure 4B). Cultured enteric neurons were subsequently used to confirm GDNF-induced activation of ERK1/2 and Akt in kif26a−/− enteric neurons. After GDNF treatment, the cultured kif26a−/− neurons exhibited higher levels of pERK1/2 and pAkt compared with WT neurons (Figures 4C–4F). These results demonstrated that GDNF-Ret signaling in kif26a−/− enteric neurons was hypersensitive to GDNF. GDNF binds to the heteromeric GFRα1-Ret receptor complex, and the receptor complex then binds to and phosphorylates SHC. Phosphorylated SHC connects Ret to the cytoplasmic Grb2-Sos and Grb2-Gab complex, resulting in activation of the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway and PI3K/Akt, respectively (Besset et al., 2000Besset V. Scott R.P.

The GDNF receptor complex is endogenously expressed in the neuroblastoma cell line TGW, and GDNF treatment results in phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt (Ohiwa et al., 1997Ohiwa M. Murakami H. Iwashita T. Asai N. Iwata Y. Imai T. Funahashi H. Takagi H. Takahashi M. Characterization of Ret-Shc-Grb2 complex induced by GDNF, MEN 2A, and MEN 2B mutations.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

As we also find KIF26A expressed in TGW cells (Figure 5A, upper panel), these cells were used to study the function of KIF26A. We generated a series of KIF26A deletion mutants (Figure 5A, lower panel), and these constructs were overexpressed in TGW cells. As a result, ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, in response to GDNF, was significantly inhibited when the full-length or tail domain of KIF26A (KIF26A-t; 751–1881 aa) was overexpressed. In contrast, these effects were not observed when the control vector or the tail-less construct of KIF26A (Δtail; 1–730 aa) was overexpressed (Figure 5B). These results led us to propose that a physical interaction might exist between the KIF26A tail domain and molecular components of the GDNF-Ret pathway. To test this directly, we preformed yeast two-hybrid assays and found that Grb2 specifically bound to the KIF26A tail domain (Figure S5A). However, Sos1, the Ret intracellular domain (639–1073 aa of Ret), SHC, wild-type Ras (RasWT), active or inactive Ras (RasV12 or RasN17), and Gab1 did not show binding. The KIF26A/Grb2 interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged KIF26A or endogenous KIF26A with endogenous Grb2 (Figures 5C and 5D). Furthermore, we find that the SH2 domain, but not the SH3 domain, of Grb2 was found to specifically associate with KIF26A (Figure 5E). Previous studies have established that the SH2 domain of Grb2 interacts with the phosphorylated form of SHC adaptor protein via the phosphotyrosine binding pocket (Chardin et al., 1995Chardin P. Cussac D. Maignan S. Ducruix A. The Grb2 adaptor.FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 47-51Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When arginine (86 aa) in Grb2 is substituted for lysine, that binding was abolished (Hidaka et al., 1991Hidaka M. Homma Y. Takenawa T. Highly conserved eight amino acid sequence in SH2 is important for recognition of phosphotyrosine site.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1490-1497Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, even this mutant could bind to KIF26A (Figure S5B), suggesting that phosphotyrosine was not directly involved in Grb2 binding to KIF26A. Further yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that the 1429–1600 aa of KIF26A were sufficient to bind to the Grb2 SH2 domain (Figure S5C). However, previously known motifs for Grb2 SH2 binding were not detected in this domain. To test the possibility that KIF26A determined Grb2 localization by binding to microtubules, we compared the cellular localization of Grb2 between kif26a−/− and WT enteric neurons. Grb2 localization in kif26a−/− enteric neurons was not significantly different from that in WT enteric neurons (Figures S5E–S5J). We then tested whether the KIF26A and its deletion mutants would interfere with Grb2-SHC complex formation. When full-length or tail domain of KIF26A was overexpressed in TGW cells, GDNF-induced formation of the SHC-Grb2 complex was significantly inhibited (Figure 5F). These results suggested that association of KIF26A with Grb2 sufficiently inhibited signaling, irrespective of KIF26A microtubule binding activity. Subsequently, the effects of KIF26A overexpression on GDNF-induced formation of Ret-Sos1 and Ret-Gab1 complexes were analyzed, because the complex formation depends on Grb2 and these complexes are required to activate Ras-MAPK and PI3K-Akt cascades, respectively (Besset et al., 2000Besset V. Scott R.P. Ibanez C.F. Signaling complexes and protein-protein interactions involved in the activation of the Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways by the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39159-39166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that KIF26A overexpression inhibited formation of these complexes, while the tail-less mutant did not (Figure 5G). To monitor Ras activation, a downstream signal of this cascade, we compared intracellular levels of GTP-binding Ras (GTP-Ras) by using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay with the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf (Matsui et al., 2002Matsui T. Kinoshita T. Morikawa Y. Tohya K. Katsuki M. Ito Y. Kamiya A. Miyajima A. K-Ras mediates cytokine-induced formation of E-cadherin-based adherens junctions during liver development.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1021-1030Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As a result, increased GTP-Ras after GDNF treatment was significantly inhibited by KIF26A overexpression (Figure S5D). We also investigated the in vivo complex formation between SHC and Grb2 in kif26a−/− mice. In the presence and absence of GDNF, SHC-Grb2 complex levels were below detection level in lysates from the outer (muscular) colon layer of WT mice (Figure 6A). However, in lysates from kif26a−/− muscular layers, SHC and Grb2 association was abnormally increased in the presence of GDNF (Figure 6A). Furthermore, Sos1 and Gab1 levels associated with Ret were also significantly increased in lysates from GDNF-treated kif26a−/− muscular layers (Figure 6B). Finally, we analyzed whether KIF26A could have other effects on the signaling pathway. Full-length KIF26A overexpression did not alter cell surface levels of Ret in the TGW cells (Figure S5K). In addition, when KIF26A was coex"

LC3, the most commonly examined autophagy marker in mammalian cells, labels structures that are frequently manifested as dots or rings using light microscopy; however, the nature of these structures is not entirely clear. We reported here a novel approach to examine the LC3-positive compartment in cell-free lysates, which revealed that they were actually tubulovesicular structures with considerable heterogeneity. Using affinity purification, we isolated these membranes for electron microscopy, which indicated that they possessed ultrastructural features consistent with autophagosomal membranes at various maturation stages. Further biochemical and proteomics analyses demonstrated the presence of multiple autophagy-related and other functional molecules. The different distribution patterns of Atg5, Atg16, Atg9, and p62/SQSTM1 on the LC3-positive compartment provided new clues on how these molecules might be involved in the dynamics of the autophagosomal membranes. Finally, several morphologically unique groups of LC3-positive membranes were categorized. Their topological configurations suggested that double-membrane vesicles could be derived from single membrane compartments via different means, including tubule-to-vesicle conversion, whose presence was supported by live cell imaging. These findings thus provide new information on the dynamics of the autophagosomal compartment.

How molecular events lead to the formation of autophagosomes is not known, although several hypotheses have been proposed based on electron microscopic studies (4Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y.

Typical autophagosomes revealed by EM are vesicles delimited by double membranes or, in some cases, multiple membranes (1De Duve C. Wattiaux R. Annu. Rev.

Various cytosolic contents could be found within the cisternal lumen of autophagosomes. Fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes forms the single-membrane autolysosomes with increased electron density. EM studies had led to the hypothesis that the formation of autophagosomes might start with a crescent-shaped membrane cisterna, also called the isolation membrane or phagophore (4Suzuki K. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2156-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 5Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar, 8Mizushima N.

The various components in the autophagosomal compartment could be recognized by the presence of specific autophagy molecules (9Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T.

Thus, Atg16L1 and Atg5 were mainly present in the phagophore, whereas LC3, a mammalian Atg8 homologue, labels isolation membranes, matured autophagosomes, and autolysosomes, suggesting that different Atg molecules may participate in autophagosome biogenesis at different stages. However, cells processed for traditional EM could not be subjected to further investigation to test these hypotheses. Consequently, various Atg markers have been examined in living cells to monitor and to understand the biological process. Atg16L1 and LC3 are diffusively present in the cytoplasm of cells under basal conditions but accumulate at discrete spots following autophagic stimulation. These puncta are thought to represent the same autophagosomal structures as those identified by EM at various maturation stages (9Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5390) Google Scholar, 10Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence has yet to be sought to document that these puncta indeed represent such structures even though their formation seems to be highly specific. One hurdle is that few morphological features, other than being described as dots or rings, could be ascribed to these puncta. Another is that no specific methods have been developed to probe these structures from living cells in greater detail. We have attempted to overcome these hurdles by examining the LC3-labeled puncta in cell-free lysate and purifying them for EM and biochemical analysis. The results not only confirmed their autophagosomal nature, but defined new molecular, morphological, and topological features that could be important for understanding autophagosome membrane dynamics. HEK-293 and HCT-116 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and other standard supplements. LC3 (specifically LC3B), Atg16L1, Atg5, and Atg9L1 were isolated from human cDNA and cloned to pEGFP or pDsRed/monomer vector (Clontech) at their N terminus. Stable cell lines with GFP-LC3 were created with standard methodology. Transient transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were treated 48 h later as indicated. Starvation was induced by replacing the complete medium with Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS). 2The abbreviations used are: EBSSEarle's balanced salt solutionLC3-TVSLC3-positive tubular vesicular structuresPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCPPcalcium phosphate precipitate. Autophagy induction by calcium phosphate precipitate (CPP) was conducted as described previously (15Gao W. Ding W.X. Stolz D.B. Yin X.M. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured at the density of 2 × 105/ml/per well in 12-well plates overnight. Right before the treatment, CPP solution was prepared by mixing Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.05, 3 mm Na2HPO4) and calcium chloride (256 mm) in equal volumes. For each milliliter of culture, 100 μl of CPP solution was added dropwise. Cells were then analyzed within 2–6 h. Earle's balanced salt solution LC3-positive tubular vesicular structures phosphate-buffered saline 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid green fluorescent protein calcium phosphate precipitate. To prepare cell lysates for the observation of the LC3-positive structure, cells cultured in 6-well plates were washed with cold PBS and then homogenized in 2 ml of cold Buffer B (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) by passing 10–15 times through a 22-gauge needle (for HEK-293 cells) or a 28-gauge needle (for HCT116 cells). The lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The post-nuclear fraction (10 μl) was loaded onto a glass slide and covered with a glass coverslip for immediate fluorescence microscopic examination. Cells cultured in plastic plates were directly imaged using a Nikon TE 200 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Melville NY) equipped with a digital camera (CoolSNAP HQ2; Photometrics, Inc.). Time-lapse images of LC3-positive structures in cell lysates were acquired under a 60×/1.40 oil objective and assembled using NIS-Elements AR3.0 software (Nikon, Melville, NY) at 2–5-s intervals for 60–180 s. Live cell confocal imaging was performed on cells grown in glass bottom culture dishes (Mattek), which were maintained in a temperature-controlled, humidified environmental chamber (Tokai Hit, Tokyo Japan), using a Nikon 200E inverted microscope and Yokagawa (Tokyo, Japan) scan head. Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) was used to control the microscope. Single midplane images were collected from multiple different stage positions once every 3 min. Following collection, images were deconvolved using a Weiner deconvolution filter with Nikon Elements software. For electron microscopy, cells or affinity-purified LC3-TVS were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.4, for 1 h and post-fixed in aqueous 1% OsO4, 1% K3Fe(CN)6 for 1 h. Following three PBS washes, the pellet was dehydrated through a graded series of 30–100% ethanol, 100% propylene oxide and then infiltrated in 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide/Polybed 812 epoxy resin (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) for 1 h. After several changes of 100% resin over 24 h, the pellet was embedded in molds, cured at 37 °C overnight, followed by additional hardening at 65 °C for 2 more days. Ultrathin (60 nm) sections were collected on 100 mesh copper grids, stained with 2% uranyl acetate in 50% methanol for 10 min, followed by 1% lead citrate for 7 min. Sections were imaged using a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope (Peabody, MA) at 80 kV fitted with a bottom mount AMT 2k digital camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA). HEK-293 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were treated with CPP for 6 h. Cells were then washed in PBS and disrupted in Buffer B. The post-nuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were washed twice in the washing buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA) to remove residual cytosolic GFP-LC3. The pellets were finally suspended in PBS with 2 mm EDTA and 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with an anti-GFP antibody (GFP, B2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:25 dilution overnight at 4 °C. The unbound antibodies were removed by centrifugation. The pellet was washed and resuspended in PBS buffer, followed by incubation with the prewashed BioMag goat anti-mouse IgG beads (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The magnetic beads were separated from the solution using a magnetic separator. After washing, the preparation was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for EM study or resuspended in RIPA buffer for biochemical analysis. Lysates from cells or the isolated LC3-positive membranes (10 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Antibodies against the following molecules were used: GFP, p62/SQSTM1, Rab5, Rab7, and Rabaptin-5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Beclin-1, Rab4, Rab11, Rabex-5, and EEA-1 (BD Biosciences); Atg5, Atg9L1, Atg16L1, UVRAG, and VPS34 (Abgent, Inc.); clathrin and HSP70 (Cell Signaling Technology); β-actin (Sigma); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Novus Biologicals); LAMP1 (clone H4A3) and LAMP2 (clone ABL-93) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa); and Rab33 (16Zheng J.Y. Koda T. Fujiwara T. Kishi M. Ikehara Y. Kakinuma M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3B antibody was made using a peptide representing the N-terminal 14 amino acids of human LC3B and an additional cysteine (PSEKTFKQRRTFEQC). LC3-positive membranes on the magnetic beads were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The beads were then suspended in RIPA and/or urea lysis buffer (9.5 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.8% ampholytes, and 1% dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors) for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatants were then collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. After the non-protein elements were removed with the 2-D Clean-up kit (GE Healthcare), the protein precipitates were dissolved in 9.5 m urea lysis buffer containing 0.5% v/v IPG buffer (pH 3–10, nonlinear, GE Healthcare) and quantified for protein concentration using a Bradford-based protein assay (Bio-Rad). The two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed as described previously (17Kang J.H. Kim H.T. Choi M.S. Lee W.H. Huh T.L. Park Y.B. Moon B.J. Kwon O.S. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 80 μg of protein was separated by isoelectric focusing using IPG strips (11 cm, pH 3–10 nonlinear) with Protean IEF Cell System (Bio-Rad) for the first dimension and a vertical gel electrophoresis apparatus system (Invitrogen) for the second dimension. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue as reported (18Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar). The protein spots on the gels were digitalized at 400 d.p.i. resolution using a Kodak Image Station 4000MM (Carestream Health). Protein spots were then excised and subjected to tryptic in-gel digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis using Voyager-DE PRO mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) as described previously (17Kang J.H. Kim H.T. Choi M.S. Lee W.H. Huh T.L. Park Y.B. Moon B.J. Kwon O.S. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Results were analyzed using 4000 Series Explorer software version 4.0 (Applied Biosystems) to obtain accurate masses (±50 ppm) for all the peptides in the tryptic digest. The resulting peptide mass fingerprints, together with the pI and relative molecular mass values (estimated from two-dimensional gels), were used to search the Swiss-Prot or NCBInr protein data bases, MS-FIT from Protein Prospector version 5.0, which compares the experimentally determined tryptic peptide masses with theoretical peptide masses calculated for proteins contained in the Swiss-Prot or NCBInr protein data bases. Taxonomy was set to human, and trypsin and keratin peaks were excluded. Protein identifications with a score greater than 1000, with sequence coverage more than 10% and at least four matched peptides, were considered significant. Search parameters were ±50–100 ppm peptide mass tolerance and one maximum missed cleavage. The identified proteins were classified in terms of their physiological functions and localization using information from PubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih) and the Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL protein knowledge base.

GFP-LC3 labels punctated structures in cells under autophagy stimulation. Immuno-EM has confirmed that these structures represent autophagosomes at various maturation stages (9Kabeya Y. Mizushima N.

At the cellular level, the GFP-LC3 puncta seem to possess different morphologies such as dots, rings, and even tubules (9Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5390) Google Scholar, 14Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T.

Traffic. 2006; 7: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), of which the dynamic nature, the relationship with autophagosome maturation, and the biological significance were not clear. To better understand these structures, we developed a simple but revealing approach to examine the GFP-LC3 puncta in cell-free lysates. This approach gave rise to an unprecedented level of detail about these structures and further allowed their purification for biochemical analysis. HEK-293 cells and HCT-116 cells, stably expressing GFP-LC3, were subjected to starvation in EBSS. As anticipated, GFP-LC3 puncta was induced (Fig. 1A). The morphology of the GFP-LC3 puncta under this stimulation was mostly fine dots with little definition. However, when the cells were disrupted and the lysates were observed using fluorescence microscopy, we found that these structures possessed very diverse morphology with many different configurations (Fig. 2, A and B). GFP-LC3-labeled membranes were found to be both vesicular and tubular. Tubules and vesicles could be linked together with vesicles more frequently at the end of the tubules. The cisternal structure could be dilated, twisted, and even composed of additional internal elements, which were also GFP-LC3 positive. The size of these structures was larger than would be anticipated based on the size of the puncta at the cellular level, suggesting that the puncta might represent a more packed configuration, which was relaxed upon cell lysis.FIGURE 2GFP-LC3-positive tubulovesicular structures in cell lysates. A and B, HEK-293-GFP-LC3 (A) or HCT-116-GFP-LC3 (B) cells were treated with normal medium (panels a in A and B) or EBSS (rest of the panels) for 4 h. Cells were then lysed, and LC3-TVS were identified. Representative LC3-TVS are shown. Scale bar, 2 μm. C, HEK-293-GFP-LC3 cells treated with medium (panel a) or CPP for 3 h (panels b–f) were lysed and observed. Representative LC3-TVS are shown. Scale bar, 5 μm. D and E, HEK-293-GFP-LC3 cells were treated with CPP (D) or EBSS (E) for 2 or 6 h as indicated before being lysed. Three types of LC3-TVS were quantified in the lysates in randomly selected fields using fluorescence microscopy, and the percentages (mean ± S.D.) of each type of LC3-TVS were determined. Vesicular LC3-TVS are single ring-like structures (e.g. A, panels d and e); tubular LC3-TVS are tubules only (e.g. B, panel g); and tubulovesicular LC3-TVS are the combination of vesicular and tubular structures (e.g., A, panel c; B, panel b; B, panel d; B, panel e; and C, panels c–f).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We had also observed these structures, now termed as LC3-TVS, in two other types of cells, A549 and a murine embryonic fibroblast line following starvation (data not shown). To examine whether LC3-TVS could be induced by a different autophagic stimulus, we used CPP because it induces a strong autophagic response (15Gao W. Ding W.X. Stolz D.B. Yin X.M. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Compared with starvation, the CPP-induced LC3 puncta were more prominent in terms of size and number (Fig. 1A). In addition to the smaller puncta, CPP also induced the formation of large sized ring-shaped LC3-positive structures (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, we observed that these dots or rings could be linked by LC3-positive tubules, readily visible at the cellular level (Fig. 1B). LC3-TVS were prominently present in the lysate prepared from CPP-treated cells (Fig. 2C). LC3-labeled tubules tended to be longer than those found in the lysates prepared from starved cells, consistent with the observations made at the cellular level (Fig. 1B). The LC3-labeled tubules could span more than 10 μm, with vesicles on either the end or the middle part of the tubules. However, in either starvation or CPP treatment, about two-thirds of LC3-TVS were vesicular, and the rest were either tubular or tubulovesicular (Fig. 2, D and E). Tubules accounted for less than 10% of LC3-TVS, suggesting that this configuration was relatively rare. There were no apparent differences in the distribution pattern between cells treated for 2 h and cells treated for 6 h, indicating a steady turnover of these various LC3-TVS. Thus LC3-TVS were induced in multiple cell lines following autophagic stimulation, but not in cells without autophagic stimulation (Fig. 2, A, panel a, B, panel a, and C, panel a). The presence of LC3-TVS in the lysate was entirely consistent with the appearance of LC3 puncta at the cellular level. In addition, LC3-TVS were morphologically consistent with the LC3 tubules and vesicles observed within cells, such as in the case of CPP treatment, suggesting that they were not the result of the cell lysis procedure. To determine the relationship of LC3-TVS with the autophagosomal vesicles identified by EM in intact cells, we treated HEK-293 cells, stably expressing GFP-LC3, with CPP and isolated LC3-TVS from the lysates by anti-GFP affinity purification. EM examination of the isolated materials confirmed the pleomorphic tubulovesicular nature. Some of these LC3-positive tubules (Fig. 3, a–c) clearly resembled the phagophores as defined previously (10Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 11Fengsrud M. Sneve M.L. Overbye A. Seglen P.O. Klionsky D.J. Autophagy. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2004: 11-25Google Scholar). Electron-dense material, which likely represented engulfed cellular components, could be found at the lumen side of some crescent-like cisternae (Fig. 3c). Other vesicular structures looked like mature autophagosomes delimited by double membranes (Fig. 3, e and f). Interestingly, vesicles with tubular stems could be found to have double membranes along the vesicular portion of the organelle (Fig. 3d), suggesting a transition from the tubular to vesicular component (see below). Finally, multimembranous vesicles that might represent a special form of autophagosome (11Fengsrud M. Sneve M.L. Overbye A. Seglen P.O. Klionsky D.J. Autophagy. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2004: 11-25Google Scholar) were also observed (Fig. 3f). Together, these findings indicated that LC3-TVS were quite heterogeneous, containing autophagosomal membranes at various maturation stages as observed previously using immuno-EM for LC3 localization (9Kabeya Y.

https://openalex.org/W2095271002,"δ-catenin is a brain-specific member of the adherens junction complex that localizes to the postsynaptic and dendritic compartments. This protein is likely critical for normal cognitive function; its hemizygous loss is linked to the severe mental retardation syndrome Cri-du-Chat and it directly interacts with presenilin-1 (PS1), the protein most frequently mutated in familial Alzheimer's disease. Here we examine dendritic structure and cortical function in vivo in mice lacking δ-catenin. We find that in cerebral cortex of 5-week-old mice, dendritic complexity, spine density, and cortical responsiveness are similar between mutant and littermate controls; thereafter, mutant mice experience progressive dendritic retraction, a reduction in spine density and stability, and concomitant reductions in cortical responsiveness. Our results indicate that δ-catenin regulates the maintenance of dendrites and dendritic spines in mature cortex but does not appear to be necessary for the initial establishment of these structures during development. δ-catenin is a brain-specific member of the adherens junction complex that localizes to the postsynaptic and dendritic compartments.

Cell adhesion molecules regulate the establishment and maintenance of cell morphology. In the nervous system, the highly polarized structures of neurons result, in part, from direct interactions between cadherins, a class of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules that span the plasma membrane, and catenins, intracellular proteins that bind to cadherin cytoplasmic domains (Benson and Tanaka, 1998Benson D.L.

Expression of δ-catenin begins at embryonic day 10 and peaks at postnatal day 7. In mature neurons, δ-catenin localizes to dendrites and dendritic spines (Kosik et al., 2005Kosik K.S. Donahue C.P. Israely I. Liu X. Ochiishi T. Delta-catenin at the synaptic-adherens junction.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 172-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with expression predominantly in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and to a lesser degree in the thalamus and cerebellum (Allen Brain Atlas, http://www.brain-map.org/). In dendritic spines, δ-catenin provides a link to the actin cytoskeleton via direct interactions with cortactin (Martinez et al., 2003Martinez M.C. Ochiishi T. Majewski M. Kosik K.S. Dual regulation of neuronal morphogenesis by a delta-catenin-cortactin complex and Rho.J.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8505-8516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because neural activity can regulate these interactions, δ-catenin is positioned to mediate activity-dependent alterations in synaptic adhesion and spine morphology thought to underlie adaptive changes in neural connectivity (Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M.

In cultured hippocampal neurons, dendritic branching is enriched or impoverished, respectively, by δ-catenin over- or underexpression (Arikkath et al., 2008Arikkath J. Israely I. Tao Y. Mei L. Liu X.

However, homozygous loss of δ-catenin in vivo does not appear to grossly impact neuronal development; cortical and cerebellar lamination are grossly normal, as is hippocampal formation. Synaptic ultrastructure is also qualitatively normal in these mice (Israely et al., 2004Israely I. Costa R.M. Xie C.W. Silva A.J. Kosik K.S. Liu X.

In humans, δ-catenin is localized to chromosome 5p15.2, the critical region for the severe mental retardation syndrome Cri-du-Chat (CDCS), which accounts for 1% of all mentally retarded individuals. In patients with CDCS, the severity of mental retardation correlates with hemizygous loss of the δ-catenin gene (Medina et al., 2000Medina M. Marinescu R.C. Overhauser J. Kosik K.S.

This link is further supported by studies demonstrating severe deficits in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity in mice with a targeted disruption of δ-catenin (Israely et al., 2004Israely I. Costa R.M. Xie C.W. Silva A.J. Kosik K.S. Liu X. Deletion of the neuron-specific protein delta-catenin leads to severe cognitive and synaptic dysfunction.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1657-1663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, δ-catenin was first identified through its interaction with the loop domain of presenilin-1 (Tanahashi and Tabira, 1999Tanahashi H. Tabira T. Isolation of human delta-catenin and its binding specificity with presenilin 1.Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 1997Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M.

The gene encoding presenilin-1 (PS1) is the most frequently mutated gene in familial Alzheimer's disease—a disease characterized by the progressive loss of synapses and dendrites that precedes cognitive decline. To examine how the structure and function of cortical circuits are altered by the loss of δ-catenin in vivo, we used vital imaging techniques to track changes in the structure of dendrites, the stability of spines on these dendrites, cortical responsiveness, and the organization of retinotopic maps in visual cortex of mice with a germline deletion of δ-catenin. In 5-week-old δ-catenin mutant mice, dendritic complexity, spine density, and cortical responsiveness were all normal. Thereafter, these mice experienced a progressive loss of dendrites and spines that was mirrored by decrements in cortical responsiveness and retinotopic organization. Our observations indicate that, in the neocortex, δ-catenin is critical for the maintenance, though not the establishment of neuronal structure and function in vivo. Dendrites and dendritic spines were imaged in primary sensory cortex of transgenic mice expressing EGFP in a subset of pyramidal neurons in layers 2/3 and 5 (Feng et al., 2000Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M. Nerbonne J.M. Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R. Imaging neuronal subsets in transgenic mice expressing multiple spectral variants of GFP.Neuron. 2000; 28: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). GFP-expressing neurons in these mice receive a pattern of synaptic input indistinguishable from neighboring, unlabeled neurons (Holtmaat et al., 2005Holtmaat A. Trachtenberg J.T. Wilbrecht L. Shepherd G.M. Zhang X. Knott G.W. Svoboda K. Transient and persistent dendritic spines in the neocortex in vivo.Neuron. 2005; 45: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In this line of mice, GFP expression in pyramidal neurons is suitably high for in vivo imaging around the third to fifth postnatal week in layer 5 and around the eighth to tenth postnatal week in layer 2/3. To determine how δ-catenin influences the development and maintenance of neural circuitry in primary sensory cortex, we crossed the GFP-M line of mice into a δ-catenin mutant background (see Experimental Procedures). All images of dendrites and dendritic spines were acquired in vivo. In 5-week-old mice, measurements of layer 5 apical dendrite arbor size, segment number, tip number, and branching complexity were not significantly different between age-matched controls and mutants. When these measurements were made in 10-week-old mice, the differences were striking (Figures 1A–1C). Relative to age-matched controls, total arbor length was reduced by ∼30% in mutant mice. Dendritic geometry was similarly less complex in the mutants. The total number of dendritic segments and the number of dendritic tips were reduced by 30%. Similar impairments in dendritic complexity were also observed in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in 10-week-old mutants (Figures 1D–1F), indicating that these impairments are not laminar specific. Total dendrite length was reduced by more than half a millimeter in the mutants, representing a 30% loss of arbor length. Because layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons do not express GFP at 5 weeks of age in these mice, we were unable to examine these neurons at this younger age. In both cortical layers, the lengths of lower-order branches were not measurably different between mutant and control mice (data not shown), suggesting that the simpler dendritic arbors observed in 10-week-old δ-catenin mutant mice resulted from a reduced number of higher-order dendritic segments, not a global reduction in lengths of all segments. In accordance with these observations, laser capture quantitative rtPCR showed that in wild-type mice δ-catenin RNA is expressed in both cortical layers and that its levels, normalized to actin RNA levels and expressed in arbitrary units, do not change significantly between 5 and 10 weeks of age (layer 2/3: 5 weeks postnatal – 1.8 ± 0.7, 10 weeks postnatal – 2.3 ± 0.9, p = 0.44; layer 5: 5 weeks postnatal – 1.4 ± 0.5, 10 weeks postnatal – 1.3 ± 0.23, p = 0.77; n = 4 mice at each age, laser capture from 10 sections per mouse). These observations indicate that germline deletion of δ-catenin does not impair the normal growth of cortical dendrites or dendritic spines during development but is detrimental to the maintenance of these structures in mature cortex. To obtain a more complete and nuanced understanding of what is happening to dendrites between 5 and 10 weeks of age in mutant mice, we repeatedly imaged the same cortical neurons in vivo each week. Figure 2 summarizes the results of these chronic imaging experiments from five neurons imaged in control mice and six neurons imaged in δ-catenin mutant mice. Neurons in control mice lost between 1% and 4% of their total arbor length between 5 and 10 weeks of age. The fractional loss observed over the same time course in δ-catenin mutant mice ranged from 6% to 23% of total arbor length and reached significance relative to controls at 7 weeks of age. Notably, all imaged neurons in mutant mice experienced a significant reduction of their apical arbor. However, for any given neuron, about 40% of its dendritic terminal branches experienced a retraction greater than 10 μm, with the remaining 60% of terminal branches displaying only very minor losses of less than 10 μm over a 5 week interval. Thus, the majority of dendritic length lost in δ-catenin mutant mice came from the retraction displayed on 40% of its dendritic branches. For those dendrites that did undergo a retraction, the retractions were of two types—a slow, progressive retraction from the tip or a rapid retraction with single branches losing between 65 μm and 175 μm in the course of a single week and then remaining stable at their new length for many weeks (as an example, see Figure 2C). Dendritic spines also underwent a progressive change in their kinetics and density that mirrored the time course of dendrite loss (Figure 3). At 5 weeks of age, spine density was similar between mutants and controls. By 7 weeks of age, fractional spine loss significantly increased in δ-catenin mutant mice relative to controls (Figure 3D), though we observed no measurable difference in fractional spine gain between the two groups (Figure 3E). This elevated loss of spines resulted in a significant decrease in spine density by the seventh postnatal week (KO = 2.32 ± 0.37 10 μm−1, WT = 3.64 ± 0.45 10 μm−1, p = 0.03), which continued to drop through the tenth postnatal week (spine density: KO = 1.90 ± 0.45 10 μm−1, WT = 3.13 ± 0.64 10 μm−1, p < 0.001; Figure 3F). The density of long, thin, filipodia-like protrusions was not different between mutants and controls, though densities trended lower in mutant mice. We examined the morphology of spines along stable dendrites in control and mutant mice and along dendrites that ultimately retracted in mutants (Figure 3, panels H and I). Relative brightness is a measure of spine volume (Holtmaat et al., 2005Holtmaat A. Trachtenberg J.T. Wilbrecht L. Shepherd G.M. Zhang X. Knott G.W. Svoboda K. Transient and persistent dendritic spines in the neocortex in vivo.Neuron. 2005; 45: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). An examination of the relative brightness distribution in Figure 3H shows that very small volume protrusions (<0.3 A.U.) are maintained at normal ratios, but midrange brightness is lost (asterisks), resulting in a rightward shift toward brighter protrusions. Very thin protrusions are functionally immature, weak, often lack presynatpic partners and are typically formed within 1–3 days of the image (Knott et al., 2006Knott G.W. Holtmaat A. Wilbrecht L.

Knott G. Hill T. Svoboda K. Rapid functional maturation of nascent dendritic spines.Neuron. 2009; 61: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This observation that young spines are represented at normal levels along dendrites that ultimately retract further supports the conclusion from Figure 3E that new spine growth is unaffected in mutant mice. Consistent with a role for δ-catenin in the maintenance of dendritic spines, medium-sized spines are preferentially lost in mutant mice prior to the retraction of the dendritic domain. No differences in spine lengths were found between any groups (Figure 3I; KS test, significance set to 0.05). Do these dendritic changes alter cortical function? To examine this question, we acquired movies of intrinsic optical signals as the mice viewed a bar of light moving at a fixed frequency (Figure 4A). Fourier analysis of each pixel location's change in reflectance generated two maps: a magnitude map of response amplitude at stimulus frequency (Figure 4B) and a phase map (Figure 4C) representing the time of the cortical response in the stimulus cycle (Grinvald et al., 1986Grinvald A. Lieke E. Frostig R.D. Gilbert C.D. Wiesel T.N.

Stryker M.P. New paradigm for optical imaging: temporally encoded maps of intrinsic signal.Neuron. 2003; 38: 529-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The phase value of each pixel was converted to degrees of visual angle and displayed according to a color scale corresponding to the functional retinotopic map. To evaluate the functional organization of the phase maps, we measured “map scatter,” the average difference in phase between each pixel in the map and the 24 surrounding pixels. In this metric, measured in degrees, less scatter is indicative of a smoother map and greater precision in receptive field organization (Cang et al., 2005Cang J. Renteria R.C. Kaneko M. Liu X. Copenhagen D.R. Stryker M.P. Development of precise maps in visual cortex requires patterned spontaneous activity in the retina.Neuron. 2005; 48: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In control mice, we did not observe significant changes between 5 weeks of age and 10 weeks of age in measures of cortical responsiveness or functional organization (Figures 4B–4E). In δ-catenin mice, visually driven cortical responses were degraded by 5 weeks of age relative to age-matched controls and became progressively more impaired by 10 weeks of age (Figures 4B–4E). Because the mutant mice have a germline deletion of δ-catenin, we wondered whether the reduced cortical responses to visual stimuli were cortical in origin or reflected decrements in the responsiveness of the retina or the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, the earlier stages of visual processing. We examined this by measuring the strength of the intrinsic signal optical response to direct cortical stimulation (Figures 4F–4I). Here we inserted a bipolar stimulating electrode into the cortex and passed 50, 100, and 150 micro amps of current while measuring intrinsic optical responses. In 5-week-old mutants, we found no change in cortical responsiveness relative to age-matched controls (Figures 4F and 4H). By 10 weeks of age, however, cortical responsiveness was significantly reduced in the δ-catenin mutant mice at all stimulus intensities (Figures 4G and 4I). These latter measurements support a view in which the loss of cortical responsiveness parallels the loss of dendrites rather than precedes it. The anatomical and functional data we present suggest that δ-catenin is required for the maintenance of dendrites and dendritic spines in mature neocortex but does not appear to be required for the initial establishment of normal dendrite complexity and length and spine density in vivo. This conclusion is somewhat at odds with recent reports documenting the necessity of δ-catenin for normal dendritic growth and spine formation of cultured hippocampal neurons (Arikkath et al., 2008Arikkath J.

Because all of the data we present here documents changes in mature cortex in vivo, we can make no statement on whether our conclusions can be applied to developing hippocampus. Our results also support a view in which proper cortical function, and by extension, cognitive function, depends on the maintenance of the full complexity of each neuron's dendritic tree and the maintenance of the synaptic input to these dendrites. Notably, our data do not support a role for δ-catenin in the formation of new dendritic spines. The rate of spine growth was unaffected in mutant mice, and the cumulative distribution of spine volumes along retracting dendrites showed no change in the fraction of small volume spines, which have very short lifetimes and typically grow in the 1–3 day period preceding the image (Holtmaat et al., 2005Holtmaat A. Trachtenberg J.T. Wilbrecht L. Shepherd G.M. Zhang X. Knott G.W. Svoboda K.

Long-term in vivo imaging of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in adult cortex.Nature. 2002; 420: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). The observed progressive decline in dendritic length, complexity, and spine density in the δ-catenin mutant mice decreases the connectivity of neural circuits. This likely underlies the loss of cortical responsiveness to sensory and direct stimulation and impairs the integration and processing of information in these circuits (Hausser et al., 2000Hausser M. Spruston N. Stuart G.J. Diversity and dynamics of dendritic signaling.Science. 2000; 290: 739-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Loss or abnormal connectivity in the cortex has long been suggested to underlie mental retardation (Kaufmann and Moser, 2000Kaufmann W.E. Moser H.W. Dendritic anomalies in disorders associated with mental retardation.Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In humans, δ-catenin is localized on chromosome 5p15.2, the critical region for the severe mental retardation syndrome, Cri-du-Chat. Breakpoint analysis in patients with 5p terminal deletions indicates that the severity of mental retardation correlated with hemizygous loss of the δ-catenin gene (Medina et al., 2000Medina M. Marinescu R.C. Overhauser J. Kosik K.S. Hemizygosity of delta-catenin (CTNND2) is associated with severe mental retardation in cri-du-chat syndrome.Genomics. 2000; 63: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is not clear how dendrites are compromised in CDCS, and attributing any dendritic anomalies to δ-catenin loss is problematic because semaphorin F, a regulator of axon pathfinding, is also localized to the same chromosomal region. However, our studies suggest that CDCS, and other forms of mental retardation could result from a progressive degeneration of neural connectivity rather than, or in addition to a deficit of circuit establishment. These results have additional implications in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. δ-catenin was first identified through its interaction with the loop domain of presenilin-1 (PS1), a region containing a concentration of Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD)-linked point mutations (Zhou et al., 1997Zhou J. Liyanage U. Medina M. Ho C. Simmons A.D. Lovett M. Kosik K.S. Presenilin 1 interaction in the brain with a novel member of the Armadillo family.Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). FAD is a disorder characterized in its earliest stages by cognitive decline, followed by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, degeneration of neuronal architecture, and eventual neuronal loss (Selkoe, 2001Selkoe D.J. Clearing the brain's amyloid cobwebs.Neuron. 2001; 32: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Notably, overexpression of wild-type PS1 inhibits δ-catenin-induced cellular branching and promotes δ-catenin processing and turnover (Kim et al., 2006Kim J.S. Bareiss S. Kim K.K. Tatum R. Han J.R. Jin Y.H. Kim H. Lu Q. Kim K. Presenilin-1 inhibits delta-catenin-induced cellular branching and promotes delta-catenin processing and turnover.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and FAD mutations in the PS1 loop domain, M146V and L286V, accelerate the degradation of δ-catenin (Kim et al., 2006Kim J.S. Bareiss S. Kim K.K. Tatum R. Han J.R. Jin Y.H. Kim H. Lu Q. Kim K. Presenilin-1 inhibits delta-catenin-induced cellular branching and promotes delta-catenin processing and turnover.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The progressive retraction of dendrites and loss of presumptive synapses in the δ-catenin mutant mice bears strong similarity to the pathogenesis of FAD. It is possible that δ-catenin degradation is enhanced in FAD, resulting in a progressive decline in protein levels. This, in turn, may contribute to the observed morphological and pathological changes that occur in the pathogenesis of FAD. Taken together, this work indicates a role for δ-catenin in the maintenance of neural function by regulating the stability of dendritic and synaptic structures in vivo. Our data lend support to the importance of the maintenance of proper connectivity in cognitive function and provide insight into mechanisms that may underlie severe mental retardation and diseases of the nervous system. δ-catenin mutant mice, expressing a fusion of the N terminus of the protein and a GFP-stop cassette, were generated as described in Israely et al., 2004Israely I. Costa R.M. Xie C.W. Silva A.J. Kosik K.S. Liu X. Deletion of the neuron-specific protein delta-catenin leads to severe cognitive and synaptic dysfunction.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1657-1663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar. This fusion protein lacks the armadillo repeats and PDZ domains essential for localization and function. These mice were bred with Thy1-GFP mice (Feng et al., 2000Feng G. Mellor R.H. Bernstein M. Keller-Peck C. Nguyen Q.T. Wallace M. Nerbonne J.M. Lichtman J.W. Sanes J.R.

Heterozygous offspring were then crossed to produce δ-catenin mutant;Thy1-GFP+/− mice. δ-catenin+/+;Thy1-GFP littermates were used as controls. Surgery, imaging, and analysis were performed as detailed in Chow et al., 2009Chow D.K. Groszer M. Pribadi M. Machniki M. Carmichael S.T. Liu X. Trachtenberg J.T.

Briefly, for acute imaging experiments the skull was thinned to a thickness of 20–50 μm under isoflurane anesthesia. For chronic imaging experiments, the skull was removed and replaced with a 3 mm diameter glass coverslip. Images of GFP-expressing pyramidal neurons in cortex were obtained using a custom-built two-photon laser-scanning microscope. A Ti:Sapphire pulsed laser (SpectraPhysics Mai Tai BB) tuned to 910 nm was used to excite GFP. Emitted photons were collected using an Olympus 40× 0.8NA IR water-dipping objective lens and were detected using a Hamamatsu R3896 photomultiplier tube. Control of the microscope and image collection was carried out using ScanImage software (Pologruto et al., 2003Pologruto T.A. Sabatini B.L. Svoboda K. ScanImage: flexible software for operating laser scanning microscopes.Biomed. Eng. Online. 2003; 2: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Dendrites were traced in three dimensions from image stacks and analyzed using Neurolucida's Image Stack module. δ-catenin mutant mice and wild-type littermates were anesthetized with halothane (5% for induction, 1%–2% for maintenance) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame. The eyes were covered with silicon oil. The scalp covering the right occipital cortex was resected and the skull covered with agar and a glass coverslip. The region of the skull over V1 was illuminated with 546 nm light to acquire an image of the surface vasculature. For ISI the preparation was illuminated with 700 nm light and imaged with a tandem lens macroscope defocused 600 μm into the brain. Images were acquired with a 12-bit CCD camera (Dalsa 1M30), frame grabber (Matrox Meteor II/Dig), and custom software. The visual stimulus was a white horizontal bar, 2 degrees in height, which drifted up or down at 0.125 Hz on a black background. An 8 min-long movie was taken for each direction (up/down), for a total of two movies. Acquisition was at 30 frames per second, and the 12-bit frames were binned in software four times temporally and 2 × 2 spatially, resulting in 16-bit image files. From movies of these 16-bit files, Fourier analysis of each pixel column generated maps of magnitude and phase at 0.125 Hz (Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003Kalatsky V.A. Stryker M.P.

Scatter was computed on phase maps that were corrected for hemodynamic delay using time reversal (Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003Kalatsky V.A. Stryker M.P.

Development of precise maps in visual cortex requires patterned spontaneous activity in the retina.Neuron. 2005; 48: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The region of interest was defined using the magnitude map after it had been smoothed using a 5 × 5 Gaussian filter. The phase value for each pixel in the masked phase map was compared to the average of its neighbors in a 5 × 5 box, and the average difference for each map was calculated. In practice, this method is capable of detecting retinotopic maps even when response magnitude is weak (Smith and Trachtenberg, 2007Smith S.L. Trachtenberg J.T. Experience-dependent binocular competition in the visual cortex begins at eye opening.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Maximum and mean magnitude values were taken from unfiltered magnitude maps. Mice were anesthetized with halothane (1%–2%) in oxygen. Body temperature was maintained using a regulated heating pad (AD Instruments; ML295M). A 2 mm diameter region of the skull overlying the primary visual cortex was thinned using a high-speed micro drill (Fine Science Tools, 18000-17). Drilling was stopped every 10 s to prevent thermal damage to the underlying cortex. A scalpel (Surgistar; 38-6900) was used to finish thinning the skull to a thickness of ∼50 μm. A small burr hole less than 200 μm was made in the center of the thinned region through which a bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC; CBBEP50) was inserted at an angle of 45 degrees until the tip reached a depth of 250 μm below the pial surface. Current was passed using an AMPI stimulus isolation unit triggered once every 8 s for 8 min by a Master-8. The intrinsic signal optical response to direct cortical stimulation was monitored using 630 nm illumination. An 8 min movie was generated at 7.5 frames per second. Each frame of the movie was 256 × 256 pixels at 16 bits. A Fourier-transform was performed on each pixel column in the movie to generate a map of cortical responsiveness, as detailed in (Smith and Trachtenberg, 2007Smith S.L. Trachtenberg J.T. Experience-dependent binocular competition in the visual cortex begins at eye opening.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For each animal, three runs each at 50 μA, 100 μA, and 150 μA were acquired and averaged to produce one average map for each mouse at each of the three stimulus intensities. Maps were analyzed using custom MatLab routines as described in Faguet et al., 2009Faguet J. Maranhao B. Smith S.L. Trachtenberg J.T. Ipsilateral eye cortical maps are uniquely sensitive to binocular plasticity.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar.

https://openalex.org/W2000325235,"Background The average nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio (N∶P) of insect herbivores is less than that of leaves, suggesting that P may mediate plant-insect interactions more often than appreciated. We investigated whether succession-related heterogeneity in N and P stoichiometry influences herbivore performance on N-fixing lupin (Lupinus lepidus) colonizing primary successional volcanic surfaces, where the abundances of several specialist lepidopteran herbivores are inversely related to lupin density and are known to alter lupin colonization dynamics. We examined larval performance in response to leaf nutritional characteristics using gelechiid and pyralid leaf-tiers, and a noctuid leaf-cutter. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted four studies. First, growth of larvae raised on wild-collected leaves responded positively to leaf %P and negatively to leaf carbon (%C), but there was no effect of %N or quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs). Noctuid survival was also positively related to %P. Second, we raised gelechiid larvae on greenhouse-grown lupins with factorial manipulation of competitors and soil N and P. In the presence of competition, larval mass was highest at intermediate leaf N∶P and high %P. Third, survival of gelechiid larvae placed on lupins in high-density patches was greater when plant competitors were removed than on controls. Fourth, surveys of field-collected leaves in 2000, 2002, and 2003 indicated that both %P and %N were generally greater in plants from low-density areas. QAs in plants from low-density areas were equal to or higher than QAs in high-density areas. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that declines in lupin P content under competitive conditions are associated with decreased larval growth and survival sufficient to cause the observed negative relationship between herbivore abundance and host density. The results support the theoretical finding that declines in stoichiometric resource quality (caused here by succession) have the potential to cause a decrease in consumer abundance despite very dense quantities of the resource."

Recent evidence indicates that the renin-angiotensin system plays a major role in liver fibrosis. In this study, we showed that angiotensin II (Ang II) evoked long lasting Ca2+ rises and induced NAADP or cADPR productions via CD38 in HSCs. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as well as NAADP-induced initial Ca2+ transients were prerequisite for the production of cADPR, which was responsible for later sustained Ca2+ rises in the Ang II-treated HSCs.

We also demonstrated that CD38 plays an important role in Ang II-induced proliferation and overproduction of extracellular matrix proteins in HSCs, which were reduced by an antagonistic cADPR analog, 8-bromo-cADPR, or in CD38−/− HSCs. Moreover, we presented evidence to implicate CD38 in the bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrogenesis; infiltration of inflammatory cells and expressions of α-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor-β1, collagen αI(1), and fibronectin were reduced in CD38−/− mice compared with those in CD38+/+ mice.

Centromeres are specialized regions of eukaryotic chromosomes that direct the assembly of kinetochores and are essential for the equal segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis (1Cleveland D.W.

Despite significant differences in size and sequence composition, general features of centromeres are highly conserved, such as the enrichment of centromere-specific proteins and the existence of pericentric heterochromatin structures. However, with the exception of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose sites of centromere formation are determined by a short stretch of DNA, most eukaryotes establish and propagate active centromeres through chromatin-based epigenetic mechanisms, which are independent of DNA sequences (1Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 2Allshire R.C. Karpen G.H. Nat. Rev.

As genomic DNA is folded with histone proteins in the form of chromatin, epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the genome include covalent modifications of histones and DNA, chromatin remodeling, and exchange of histone variants (4Allis C. Jenuwein T. Reinberg D. Epigenetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2006Google Scholar). The centromere differs fundamentally from the remainder of the genome due to its enrichment for a variant form of histone H3, CENP-A (also known as CID in Drosophila, Cse4 in budding yeast, and Cnp1 in fission yeast) (1Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 2Allshire R.C. Karpen G.H. Nat. Rev.

CENP-A serves as the foundation for the assembly of other kinetochore proteins and is essential for chromosome segregation in diverse organisms. Biochemical analysis has demonstrated that CENP-A-containing nucleosomes are more compact and assume a more rigid conformation than those containing histone H3, which might create a specialized chromatin environment at centromeres (5Black B.E.

Consistent with this, centromere chromatin in fission yeast compacts differently from the remainder of the genome (7Polizzi C. Clarke L. J.

Cell. 1992; 3: 819-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and reporter genes inserted within the centromeres are usually silenced (9Allshire R.C. Javerzat J.P. Redhead N.J. Cranston G. Cell. 1994; 76: 157-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Several proteins that are required for chromosome segregation, including CENP-ACnp1, were identified in genetic screens for mutations that affect centromere silencing (10Pidoux A.L. Richardson W. Allshire R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, whether the formation of CENP-ACnp1 chromatin directly contributes to centromere silencing is not known. From fission yeast to mammals, centromere regions are usually surrounded by repetitive DNA elements that form heterochromatin structures (1Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 2Allshire R.C. Karpen G.H. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 923-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The formation of heterochromatin requires the concerted actions of a diverse array of enzymatic activities that lead to the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me) and the recruitment of heterochromatin proteins such as HP1/Swi6 to ensure transcriptional silencing across the entire heterochromatin domain (11Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Pericentric heterochromatin also contributes to the fidelity of chromosome segregation as it recruits cohesin proteins, which are required for proper chromosome cohesion (12Bernard P. Maure J.F.

Watanabe Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Recent studies in fission yeast demonstrate that a JmjC domain-containing protein, Msc1, is required for normal chromosome segregation and that overexpression of Msc1 rescues the lethality associated with a CENP-Acnp1 mutation (14Ahmed S.

Interestingly, Msc1 overexpression suppresses a CENP-Acnp1 mutation only in the presence of the H2A variant H2A.ZPht1 (14Ahmed S. Dul B. Qiu X. Walworth N.C.

Using biochemical purification, we found that Msc1 is an integral component of the fission yeast Swr1 complex, as has been shown recently (33Shevchenko A. Roguev A. Schaft D. Buchanan L. Habermann B.

Although H2A.ZPht1 is not enriched at centromeres, loss of H2A.ZPht1, as well as Msc1 and Swr1, results in loss of silencing at centromeres and defects in chromosome segregation. Interestingly, CENP-Acnp1 levels at centromeres are normal in the absence of H2A.ZPht1, suggesting that CENP-Acnp1 is not sufficient to impose silencing at centromere regions. Instead, H2A.ZPht1 regulates the expression of CENP-CCnp3, a centromere protein required for centromere silencing. These results demonstrate that H2A.ZPht1 maintains the silenced chromatin state that is critical for the fidelity of chromosome segregation. chromatin immunoprecipitation green fluorescent protein whole cell extract; reverse transcription plant homeodomain. Msc1-FLAG, Swr1-FLAG, Swr1-Myc, Pht1-Myc, Cnp1-FLAG, Cnp1-GFP, Cnp3-Myc, swr1Δ, pht1Δ, and cnp3Δ strains were constructed using a PCR-based module method (35Bähler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie 3rd, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Msc1 mutants were generated by first inserting a ura4+ gene in the coding region of msc1+ and subsequent replacement with mutated DNA sequences. Genetic crosses were used to construct all other strains. For serial dilution plating assays, 10-fold dilutions of a log-phase culture were plated on the indicated medium and grown for 3 days at 30 °C. Assaying the rate of chromosome loss was performed as described previously (36Jia S. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The minichromosome Ch16 contains an ade6-M216 allele that complements an ade6-M210 allele at its normal chromosome location. Cells from Ade+ colonies were plated on adenine-limiting medium and incubated at 30 °C for 4 days. If chromosome loss occurs in the first division, half of the resultant colony carrying Ch16 will be white, whereas the half without Ch16 will be red. The number of half-sectored red/white colonies was determined, and the rate of chromosome loss per cell division was calculated by dividing the number of half-sectored colonies by the total number of white colonies plus half-sectored colonies. Affinity purification of Msc1-FLAG and Swr1-FLAG complexes and MudPIT mass spectrometry analysis were performed as described previously (37Wang Y. Reddy B. Thompson J. Wang H. Noma K. Yates 3rd, J.R. Jia S. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 428-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were prepared by lysis of cells with glass beads, followed by sonication to dissolve chromatin (37Wang Y. Reddy B. Thompson J. Wang H. Noma K. Yates 3rd, J.R. Jia S. Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 428-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used for Western blot analyses: FLAG (Sigma, F7425 and F3165) and Myc (Covance, MMP-150). ChIP analysis was performed as described previously (36Jia S. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed with Myc or FLAG antibodies. ChIP-chip analysis was performed according to the “Agilent Yeast ChIP-on-chip Analysis” protocol. Blunt-end DNA was generated from immunoprecipitated chromatin fractions (ChIP) or from whole cell extract (WCE) with T4 DNA polymerase and then ligated to a linker. ChIP and WCE DNAs were amplified from the blunt-end DNA samples with primers annealing to the linker and were labeled with Cy5- or Cy3-dUTP, respectively, by random priming PCR (Invitrogen comparative genomic hybridization kit). 2.5–5 μg of Cy5-labeled ChIP DNA and corresponding Cy3-labeled WCE DNA were hybridized to an Agilent Schizosaccharomyces pombe whole genome ChIP-on-chip microarray (G4810A). The slides were washed and processed in accordance with Agilent protocols and scanned with an Agilent scanner. Data were collected with the Agilent Feature Extraction program. The enrichment value for each probe was calculated by dividing normalized ChIP signal by WCE signal. For PCR-based quantification, DNA isolated from ChIP or WCE was quantitatively analyzed by competitive PCR in which one primer pair amplifies a region of interest, whereas the other primer pair amplifies control fbp1 (located in euchromatin) or cox3 (located in the mitochondrial genome). The ratios of intensities of the region of interest to control signals in the ChIP and WCE lanes were used to calculate the relative -fold enrichment. Values <1 indicate no enrichment. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas) in an ABI 7300 real-time PCR system. DNA serial dilutions were used as templates to generate a standard curve of amplification for each pair of primers, and the relative concentration of target sequence was calculated accordingly. A cox3 fragment was used as a reference to calculate the enrichment of ChIP over WCE for each target sequence. Total cellular RNA was isolated from log-phase cells using a MasterPure yeast RNA purification kit (EPICENTRE Biotechnologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with 250 ng of RNA as a template with the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Reactions in which the RT step was omitted were performed in parallel. Quantification with real-time RT-PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step kit (Applied Biosystems). RNA serial dilutions were used as templates to generate the standard curve of amplification for each pair of primers, and the relative concentration of target sequence was calculated accordingly. An act1 fragment served as a reference to normalize the concentration of samples. The concentration of each target gene in the wild type was arbitrarily set to 1 and served as a reference for other samples. Msc1 has been shown to be required for proper chromosome segregation (14Ahmed S. Dul B. Qiu X. Walworth N.C. Genetics. 2007; 177: 1487-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanism that regulates Msc1 function, we generated a yeast strain expressing Msc1 fused with a 3×FLAG epitope (Msc1-FLAG) at the endogenous msc1+ locus. Transcription of the modified gene is driven by its natural promoter from the endogenous chromatin environment to ensure wild-type expression levels. The fusion protein is functional, as no defect in the segregation of a nonessential minichromosome was observed (Fig. 1A). Expression of Msc1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis with a anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1B). Immunoaffinity-purified Msc1 complex contains a number of proteins in addition to Msc1 (Fig. 1C) and was subjected to MudPIT mass spectrometry analysis (38Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). Among the proteins identified were Swr1, Rvb1, Rvb2, Act1, Alp5, Arp6, Swc2, Swc3, Swc4, Swc6, Yaf9, and H2A.ZPht1, as well as core histones (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, their budding yeast homologs all belong to the Swr1 complex that catalyzes the exchange of H2A.ZHtz1 with H2A. The budding yeast Swr1 complex also contains three additional subunits, Bdf1, Swc5, and Swc7 (29Krogan N.J. Keogh M.C. Datta N. Sawa C. Ryan O.W. Ding H. Haw R.A. Pootoolal J. Tong A. Canadien V.

Wu W.H. Sen S. Wu C. Science. 2004; 303: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect any Swc5 or Swc7 homologs in either of two independent purifications of Msc1 and only low levels of Bdf1 in one purification (Fig. 1D). To confirm that Msc1 associates with the fission yeast Swr1 complex, we generated a yeast strain that expresses both Msc1-FLAG and Swr1-Myc at their native chromosomal loci. We found that Msc1-FLAG co-immunoprecipitated with Swr1-Myc (Fig. 1E), and gel filtration analysis of the purified complex showed that Msc1-FLAG and Swr1-Myc migrated in the same fraction (Fig. 1F). We caution that the molecular mass of the complex is very high, and the complex fractionates in a position very close to the resolution limit of the column. To further confirm that Msc1 is part of the Swr1 complex, we also generated a FLAG-tagged version of Swr1 at its endogenous chromosomal location (Fig. 2A). Silver staining of the purified Swr1 complex indicated that the components are similar to those of the Msc1 complex (Fig. 2B), which is corroborated by MudPIT analysis (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that Msc1 is an integral component of the Swr1 complex. Furthermore, Msc1 is not required for Swr1 complex assembly, as the Swr1 complex purified from an msc1Δ background shows the selective loss of Msc1, but not any other component of the Swr1 complex (Fig. 2, B and C). To examine whether Msc1 and Swr1 are required for H2A.ZPht1 incorporation in vivo, we performed ChIP of a Myc-tagged version of H2A.ZPht1 and examined its genome-wide occupancy using an Agilent whole genome ChIP-on-chip microarray. H2A.ZPht1 is not uniformly distributed across the genome, as indicated by scatter plot analysis (Fig. 3A), but is instead preferentially enriched at gene promoters (Fig. 3B). To confirm this observation, we randomly picked several genes that showed both high-level enrichment of H2A.ZPht1 in ChIP-chip analysis and are longer than 1.5 kb so that we could easily distinguish between promoter and coding regions. ChIP followed by quantification with PCR-based analyses showed that H2A.ZPht1 indeed preferentially localizes to gene promoters as compared with coding regions (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S1). This pattern is similar to the distribution of H2A.Z in diverse organisms, suggesting that this is a highly conserved feature of H2A.Z distribution (39Guillemette B. Bataille A.R. Gévry N. Adam M.

Nature. 2008; 456: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The loss of either Swr1 or Msc1 resulted in the loss of H2A.ZPht1 across the genome as well as at specific genes tested (Fig. 3, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S1), demonstrating that the fission yeast Swr1 complex indeed catalyzes the exchange of H2A.ZPht1 with H2A in vivo. Moreover, the loss of Msc1 resulted in delocalization of Swr1-Myc from the promoter of vid21+, indicating that Msc1 regulates the association of Swr1 with chromatin (Fig. 3D). Meanwhile, loss of Msc1 had no effect on the stability of Swr1 as indicated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Msc1 is an essential component of the Swr1 complex that is required for targeting the complex to correct genomic locations. Because deletion of msc1+ or pht1+ results in chromosome segregation defects (14Ahmed S. Dul B. Qiu X. Walworth N.C. Genetics. 2007; 177: 1487-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 48Carr A.M. Dorrington S.M. Hindley J. Phear G.A. Aves S.J. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of the Msc1-Swr1 complex in regulating proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. Similar to msc1Δ cells, swr1Δ cells also showed elevated rates of chromosome loss (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the idea that Msc1 and Swr1 function in the same pathway genetically, an msc1Δ swr1Δ double mutant showed a rate of minichromosome loss similar to that of each single mutant (Fig. 4A). The pht1Δ mutant showed an even higher rate of chromosome loss, and the minichromosome was quickly lost from cell populations in the absence of selection pressure (Fig. 4A and data not shown) (48Carr A.M. Dorrington S.M. Hindley J. Phear G.A. Aves S.J. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This difference might be attributed to the existence of histone chaperones that mediate random incorporation of H2A.Z and compensate to some extent for the loss of Msc1 or Swr1 (49Park Y.J.

Centromeres form a unique chromatin environment due to the incorporation of the histone H3 variant CENP-A (5Black B.E. Foltz D.R. Chakravarthy S. Luger K. Woods Jr., V.L. Cleveland D.W.

Reporter genes inserted at centromere regions are usually silenced, and defects in centromere chromatin structure are frequently associated with loss of silencing at these regions (9Allshire R.C.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Loss of msc1+, swr1+, or pht1+ resulted in defective silencing of a ura4+ reporter gene inserted at CENP-A chromatin of chromosome I (cnt1::ura4+) as indicated by greater relative growth of cells in medium lacking uracil and reduced growth on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid, which is toxic to cells expressing Ura4 (Fig. 4B). In addition, an msc1Δ swr1Δ double mutant also alleviated silencing to a degree similar to each single mutant, further corroborating that Msc1 and Swr1 function in the same pathway (Fig. 4C). The slow growth rate of pht1Δ cells makes it difficult to interpret the silencing assay; however, RT-PCR analysis showed increased transcription of cnt1::ura4+ in pht1Δ as well as msc1Δ and swr1Δ cells, indicative of loss of silencing (Fig. 4D). As pericentric heterochromatin is also required for chromosome segregation by regulating cohesin recruitment (12Bernard P. Maure J.F. Partridge J.F. Genier S. Javerzat J.P. Allshire R.C. Science. 2001; 294: 2539-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 13Nonaka N. Kitajima T. Yokobayashi S. Xiao G. Yamamoto M. Grewal S.I. Watanabe Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the Swr1 complex on silencing of reporter genes inserted at pericentric heterochromatin of chromosome I (otr1::ura4+ and imr1::ura4+) (supplemental Fig. S2A). Both msc1Δ and swr1Δ showed better silencing at otr1::ura4+ than wild-type cells and little effect on silencing at imr1::ura4+ (supplemental Fig. S2B) (15Lawrence R.J. Volpe T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In contrast, loss of Clr4, which is a histone H3K9 methyltransferase essential for the integrity of pericentric heterochromatin, resulted in complete loss of silencing at both otr1::ura4+ and imr1::ura4+ (supplemental Fig. S2B). Thus, it seems that the effect of the Msc1-Swr1 complex on chromosome segregation is exerted through effects on centromere chromatin structure, but not the surrounding pericentric heterochromatin. Although Msc1 has been previously reported to be required for CENP-ACnp1 incorporation at centromeres (14Ahmed S. Dul B. Qiu X. Walworth N.C. Genetics. 2007; 177: 1487-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we found that the localization of Cnp1-FLAG at centromeres (both cnt and imr) was not affected by msc1Δ, swr1Δ, or pht1Δ (Fig. 4E).

In this study, we use Huh7 human hepatoma cells that naturally express comparable levels of CYP2E1 as human liver to demonstrate that ethanol, at subtoxic and physiologically relevant concentrations, enhances complete HCV replication. The viral RNA genome replication is affected for both genotypes 2a and 1b. Acetaldehyde, a major product of ethanol metabolism, likewise enhances HCV replication at physiological concentrations. The potentiation of HCV replication by ethanol is suppressed by inhibiting CYP2E1 or aldehyde dehydrogenase and requires an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio. In addition, acetate, isopropyl alcohol, and concentrations of acetone that occur in diabetics enhance HCV replication with corresponding increases in the NADH/NAD+. Furthermore, inhibiting the host mevalonate pathway with lovastatin or fluvastatin and fatty acid synthesis with 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid or cerulenin significantly attenuates the enhancement of HCV replication by ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, as well as acetate, whereas inhibiting β-oxidation with β-mercaptopropionic acid increases HCV replication. Ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetate increase the total intracellular cholesterol content, which is attenuated with lovastatin. In contrast, both endogenous and exogenous ROS suppress the replication of HCV genotype 2a, as previously shown with genotype 1b. Conclusion: Therefore, lipid metabolism and alteration of cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio are likely to play a critical role in the potentiation of HCV replication by ethanol rather than oxidative stress.

https://openalex.org/W2152815529,"Background One of the great unresolved controversies in paleobiology is whether extinct dinosaurs were endothermic, ectothermic, or some combination thereof, and when endothermy first evolved in the lineage leading to birds. Although it is well established that high, sustained growth rates and, presumably, high activity levels are ancestral for dinosaurs and pterosaurs (clade Ornithodira), other independent lines of evidence for high metabolic rates, locomotor costs, or endothermy are needed. For example, some studies have suggested that, because large dinosaurs may have been homeothermic due to their size alone and could have had heat loss problems, ectothermy would be a more plausible metabolic strategy for such animals. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe two new biomechanical approaches for reconstructing the metabolic rate of 14 extinct bipedal dinosauriforms during walking and running. These methods, well validated for extant animals, indicate that during walking and slow running the metabolic rate of at least the larger extinct dinosaurs exceeded the maximum aerobic capabilities of modern ectotherms, falling instead within the range of modern birds and mammals. Estimated metabolic rates for smaller dinosaurs are more ambiguous, but generally approach or exceed the ectotherm boundary. Conclusions/Significance Our results support the hypothesis that endothermy was widespread in at least larger non-avian dinosaurs. It was plausibly ancestral for all dinosauriforms (perhaps Ornithodira), but this is perhaps more strongly indicated by high growth rates than by locomotor costs. The polarity of the evolution of endothermy indicates that rapid growth, insulation, erect postures, and perhaps aerobic power predated advanced “avian” lung structure and high locomotor costs."
https://openalex.org/W2170403515,"The extraintestinal pathogen, avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), known to cause systemic infections in chickens, is responsible for large economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. In order to identify genes involved in the early essential stages of pathogenesis, namely adhesion and colonization, Signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) was applied to a previously established lung colonization model of infection by generating and screening a total of 1,800 mutants of an APEC strain IMT5155 (O2:K1:H5; Sequence type complex 95). The study led to the identification of new genes of interest, including two adhesins, one of which coded for a novel APEC fimbrial adhesin (Yqi) not described for its role in APEC pathogenesis to date. Its gene product has been temporarily designated ExPEC Adhesin I (EA/I) until the adhesin-specific receptor is identified. Deletion of the ExPEC adhesin I gene resulted in reduced colonization ability by APEC strain IMT5155 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, complementation of the adhesin gene restored its ability to colonize epithelial cells in vitro. The ExPEC adhesin I protein was successfully expressed in vitro. Electron microscopy of an afimbriate strain E. coli AAEC189 over-expressed with the putative EA/I gene cluster revealed short fimbrial-like appendages protruding out of the bacterial outer membrane. We observed that this adhesin coding gene yqi is prevalent among extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) isolates, including APEC (54.4%), uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) (65.9%) and newborn meningitic E. coli (NMEC) (60.0%), and absent in all of the 153 intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains tested, thereby validating the designation of the adhesin as ExPEC Adhesin I. In addition, prevalence of EA/I was most frequently associated with the B2 group of the EcoR classification and ST95 complex of the multi locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme, with evidence of a positive selection within this highly pathogenic complex. This is the first report of the newly identified and functionally characterized ExPEC adhesin I and its significant role during APEC infection in chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2157489088,"Background Chronic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic age-associated, degenerative diseases. Pro-inflammatory host responses that are deleterious later in life may originate from evolutionary selection for genetic variation mediating resistance to infectious diseases under adverse environmental conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings In the Upper-East region of Ghana where infection has remained the leading cause of death, we studied the effect on survival of genetic variations at the IL10 gene locus that have been associated with chronic diseases. Here we show that an IL10 haplotype that associated with a pro-inflammatory innate immune response, characterised by low IL-10 (p = 0.028) and high TNF-α levels (p = 1.39×10−3), was enriched among Ghanaian elders (p = 2.46×10−6). Furthermore, in an environment where the source of drinking water (wells/rivers vs. boreholes) influences mortality risks (HR 1.28, 95% CI [1.09–1.50]), we observed that carriers of the pro-inflammatory haplotype have a survival advantage when drinking from wells/rivers but a disadvantage when drinking from boreholes (pinteraction = 0.013). Resequencing the IL10 gene region did not uncover any additional common variants in the pro-inflammatory haplotype to those SNPs that were initially genotyped. Conclusions/Significance Altogether, these data lend strong arguments for the selection of pro-inflammatory host responses to overcome fatal infection and promote survival in adverse environments."

Active ERK increases expression and activity of the c-Jun transcription factor, linking ERK and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascades. Here, we show that c-Jun regulates transcription of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) with a concomitant impact on Akt and protein kinase C (PKC) activity and related substrates. Inhibition of c-Jun reduces PDK1 expression and attenuates Akt and PKC activity, which can be restored by exogenous PDK1. c-Jun regulation of PDK1 in melanoma contributes to growth rate and the ability to form tumors in mice. Correspondingly, increased levels of c-Jun in melanoma cell lines coincide with up-regulation of PDK1 and phosphorylation of PKC and Akt. The identification of c-Jun as a transcriptional regulator of PDK1 expression highlights key mechanisms underlying c-Jun oncogenic activity, and provides new insight into the nature of up-regulated Akt and PKC in melanoma.

https://openalex.org/W2026732419,"Senile plaques consisting of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau are major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Elucidation of factors that modulate Abeta generation and tau hyperphosphorylation is crucial for AD intervention. Here, we identify a mouse gene Rps23r1 that originated through retroposition of ribosomal protein S23. We demonstrate that RPS23R1 protein reduces the levels of Abeta and tau phosphorylation by interacting with adenylate cyclases to activate cAMP/PKA and thus inhibit GSK-3 activity. The function of Rps23r1 is demonstrated in cells of various species including human, and in transgenic mice overexpressing RPS23R1. Furthermore, the AD-like pathologies of triple transgenic AD mice were improved and levels of synaptic maker proteins increased after crossing them with Rps23r1 transgenic mice. Our studies reveal a new target/pathway for regulating AD pathologies and uncover a retrogene and its role in regulating protein kinase pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2039103092,"Background The extent to which actual movements and imagined movements maintain a shared internal representation has been a matter of much scientific debate. Of the studies examining such questions, few have directly compared actual full-body movements to imagined movements through space. Here we used a novel continuous pointing method to a) provide a more detailed characterization of self-motion perception during actual walking and b) compare the pattern of responding during actual walking to that which occurs during imagined walking. Methodology/Principal Findings This continuous pointing method requires participants to view a target and continuously point towards it as they walk, or imagine walking past it along a straight, forward trajectory. By measuring changes in the pointing direction of the arm, we were able to determine participants' perceived/imagined location at each moment during the trajectory and, hence, perceived/imagined self-velocity during the entire movement. The specific pattern of pointing behaviour that was revealed during sighted walking was also observed during blind walking. Specifically, a peak in arm azimuth velocity was observed upon target passage and a strong correlation was observed between arm azimuth velocity and pointing elevation. Importantly, this characteristic pattern of pointing was not consistently observed during imagined self-motion. Conclusions/Significance Overall, the spatial updating processes that occur during actual self-motion were not evidenced during imagined movement. Because of the rich description of self-motion perception afforded by continuous pointing, this method is expected to have significant implications for several research areas, including those related to motor imagery and spatial cognition and to applied fields for which mental practice techniques are common (e.g. rehabilitation and athletics)."
https://openalex.org/W2095000233,"Background Vibrio cholerae is the causal intestinal pathogen of the diarrheal disease cholera. It secretes the protease PrtV, which protects the bacterium from invertebrate predators but reduces the ability of Vibrio-secreted factor(s) to induce interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by human intestinal epithelial cells. The aim was to identify the secreted component(s) of V. cholerae that induces an epithelial inflammatory response and to define whether it is a substrate for PrtV. Methodology/Principal Findings Culture supernatants of wild type V. cholerae O1 strain C6706, its derivatives and pure V. cholerae cytolysin (VCC) were analyzed for the capacity to induce changes in cytokine mRNA expression levels, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion, permeability and cell viability when added to the apical side of polarized tight monolayer T84 cells used as an in vitro model for human intestinal epithelium. Culture supernatants were also analyzed for hemolytic activity and for the presence of PrtV and VCC by immunoblot analysis. Conclusions/Significance We suggest that VCC is capable of causing an inflammatory response characterized by increased permeability and production of IL-8 and TNF-α in tight monolayers. Pure VCC at a concentration of 160 ng/ml caused an inflammatory response that reached the magnitude of that caused by Vibrio-secreted factors, while higher concentrations caused epithelial cell death. The inflammatory response was totally abolished by treatment with PrtV. The findings suggest that low doses of VCC initiate a local immune defense reaction while high doses lead to intestinal epithelial lesions. Furthermore, VCC is indeed a substrate for PrtV and PrtV seems to execute an environment-dependent modulation of the activity of VCC that may be the cause of V. cholerae reactogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W1979819026,"In intestinal secretions, secretory IgA (SIgA) plays an important sentinel and protective role in the recognition and clearance of enteric pathogens. In addition to serving as a first line of defense, SIgA and SIgA·antigen immune complexes are selectively transported across Peyer's patches to underlying dendritic cells in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, contributing to immune surveillance and immunomodulation. To explain the unexpected transport of immune complexes in face of the large excess of free SIgA in secretions, we postulated that SIgA experiences structural modifications upon antigen binding. To address this issue, we associated specific polymeric IgA and SIgA with antigens of various sizes and complexity (protein toxin, virus, bacterium). Compared with free antibody, we found modified sensitivity of the three antigens assayed after exposure to proteases from intestinal washes. Antigen binding further impacted on the immunoreactivity toward polyclonal antisera specific for the heavy and light chains of the antibody, as a function of the antigen size. These conformational changes promoted binding of the SIgA-based immune complex compared with the free antibody to cellular receptors (FcαRI and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor) expressed on the surface of premyelocytic and epithelial cell lines. These data reveal that antigen recognition by SIgA triggers structural changes that confer to the antibody enhanced receptor binding properties.

Mucosal surfaces comprising the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital mucosae represent a large port of entry for most of the pathogens and thus have to be efficiently protected. This task is achieved through a combination of constitutive and innate mechanisms relying on mucus, lysozyme, lactoferrin, defensins (1Müller C.A. Autenrieth I.B. Peschel A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and induced specific immunity based, at the antibody (Ab) 2The abbreviations used are: Abantibody(ies)Agantigen(s)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayICimmune complex(es)J chainjoining chainM cellmicrofold cellMDCK cellsMadin-Darby canine kidney cellsPBSphosphate-buffered salinepIgApolymeric IgApIgRpolymeric Ig receptorSCsecretory componenthSChuman SCmSCmouse SCSIgAsecretory IgA. level, on the production of secretory IgA (SIgA). In secretions, SIgA binds antigen (Ag), thus preventing its adhesion to the luminal epithelial surface and facilitating its elimination by peristalsis or mucociliary movements (2Ogra P.L. Mestecky J. Lamm M.E. Strober W. Bienenestock J. McGhee J.R. Mucosal Immunology. American Press, San Diego2005Google Scholar), a phenomenon called immune exclusion (3Brandtzaeg P.

SIgA consists of two or four monomeric IgA linked through a joining (J) chain in association with secretory component (SC) (4Mestecky J. McGhee J.R. Adv. Immunol. 1987; 40: 153-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). SC is derived from the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) that ensures selective transport of polymeric IgA (pIgA) across the epithelium to the luminal environment (5Kaetzel C.S. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 206: 83-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). SIgA exhibits a remarkable stability in the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract (6Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another feature of SIgA is its capacity to adhere selectively to microfold (M) cells in Peyer's patches (7Mantis N.J. Cheung M.C. Chintalacharuvu K.R. Rey J. Corthésy B. Neutra M.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1844-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); these latter are subsequently able to transport SIgA Ab across the epithelium and to bring them in contact with dendritic cells in the underlying mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (8Rey J. Garin N. Spertini F. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3026-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the form of SIgA·Ag immune complexes (IC), this translates into the onset of mucosal and systemic responses associated with production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and limited activation of Ag-presenting cells (9Favre L. Spertini F. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2793-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In face of the large excess of SIgA in the intestinal lumen, intrinsic passage of the Ab or IC remains limited. In this context, we previously postulated that upon binding of the Ag, SIgA experiences conformational changes that result in increased binding to the so far unidentified IgA receptor on the apical surface of M cells (7Mantis N.J. Cheung M.C. Chintalacharuvu K.R. Rey J. Corthésy B. Neutra M.R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1844-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Conformational differences in pIgA- or SIgA-based IC compared with the corresponding free Ab may also explain differential mucus-binding properties and immune exclusion (10Phalipon A. Cardona A. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Edelman L. Sansonetti P.J. Corthésy B. Immunity. 2002; 17: 107-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To address the question of Ag-mediated structural changes in pIgA and SIgA, we focused our analysis on biochemical approaches comparing pIgA and SIgA either as free Ab molecules or in association with three antigenic structures of increased complexity, namely a protein (Clostridium difficile toxin A), a virus (rotavirus), and a bacterium (Shigella flexneri). In this study, we found that Ag-driven conformational changes can be evidenced by examining the differential sensitivity to intestinal proteases and immunoreactivity of IC compared with free Ab. Increased selective binding to known cellular receptors (FcαRI, pIgR) further revealed major changes in IC compared with free Ab. The data support the notion that binding to Ag of various sizes affects the structure of pIgA and SIgA molecules in such a manner that it makes Ag-complexed Ab molecules a better substrate for receptors that relay the function of the Ab. Chimeric IgAPCG-4 specific for C. difficile toxin A was produced as described (11Stubbe H. Berdoz J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Ascites fluid (30 ml) was obtained from BALB/c mice inoculated intraperitoneally with 2 × 106 IgA7D9 hybridoma cells (anti-VP6 rhesus monkey rotavirus) (12Burns J.W. Siadat-Pajouh M. Krishnaney A.A. Greenberg H.B. Science. 1996; 272: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). IgAC5 hybridoma (anti-S. flexneri 5a lipopolysaccharide) was cultured in a T flask (BD Falcon) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm folic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Supernatants were collected twice a week, filtered through 0.22-μm cartridges, and concentrated to a final volume of 10 ml. Both preparations were loaded onto two successive 1-m long columns filled with high resolution Sephacryl S-300 beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and run in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 116.3 mm NaCl, 10.4 mm Na2HPO4, 3.2 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)) and coupled to an Äktaprime automated fraction collector (13Favre L.I.

After separation by size exclusion chromatography, the fractions containing pIgA were pooled and concentrated using Centriplus 100 devices (Amicon, Millipore) and stored at 4 °C until further use. Purified pIgAPCG-4, pIgA7D9, and pIgAC5 were labeled with fluorescein using a commercial kit (NHS-fluorescein; Pierce). Mouse secretory component (mSC) was recovered from a stable cell line (clone 2H2) by affinity chromatography on a 2-ml M2-agarose column (14Crottet P. Peitsch M.C. Servis C. Corthésy B. J. Biol.

SIgA molecules were obtained by combining in vitro 10 μg of mouse pIgA molecules with 2 μg of hSC or mSC, respectively. Reassociation was performed in PBS for 30 min at room temperature as described previously (6Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrity and proper assembly of the molecule were examined by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and immunodetection using antisera specific for the α chain, the J chain, and SC (14Crottet P.

One colony was picked and cultured in Luria-Bertani medium (1% BactoTM tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-yeast extracts (Sigma-Aldrich)) and 1% NaCl for 1 h at 37 °C before being spread onto Luria-Bertani agar plates (1.5% BactoTM Agar in Luria-Bertani medium). Bacteria grown overnight as a lawn were recovered in 0.9% NaCl, and their concentration was determined by spectrophotometry (Ultrospec 300; Pharmacia Biotech) using the following correlation: 1 A600 corresponds to 5 × 108 bacteria/ml (17Phalipon A.

The bovine rotavirus (RF strain) was propagated in monkey kidney MA104 cells in presence of trypsin as described previously (18Ciarlet M. Estes M.K. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Virus titer present in the lysed cell supernatants was determined by plaque assay and expressed as plaque-forming units/ml. The virus was purified on a cesium chloride gradient as described before (19Perrier C. Sprenger N. Corthésy B. J. Biol.

For biochemical analyses, purified rotavirus solutions were desalted immediately before use by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 coarse beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the concentration was calculated by spectrophotometry (Ultrospec 300; Pharmacia Biotech) using the following correlation: 5.3 A260 corresponds to 1 mg/ml virus. IC were formed as follows. 100 ng of C. difficile toxin A was mixed with 50 ng of either pIgAPCG-4 or SIgAPCG-4 permitting neutralization in in vitro assays (11Stubbe H. Berdoz J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 60 ng of purified rotavirus was incubated with 100 ng of either pIgA7D9 or SIgA7D9 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, corresponding to ∼160 Ab molecules/virus (19Perrier C. Sprenger N. Corthésy B. J. Biol.

Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7751-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These conditions guarantee that no free pIgA/SIgA are found in the IC preparations. A laparotomy was performed on BALB/c mice (4–6 weeks old) purchased from Harlan (Den Horst, The Netherlands). The gut was cut, and the intestinal lumen was washed with 300 μl of PBS. Final aspiration resulted in the recovery of ∼200 μl of intestinal wash, which was immediately aliquoted and frozen in liquid nitrogen (6Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro digestion, 120 ng of purified pIgA or SIgA (pIgAPCG-4, SIgAPCG-4, pIgAC5, SIgAC5, pIgA7D9, SIgA7D9) or IC was mixed or not with 1 or 2 μl of intestinal washes in a final volume of 20 μl of PBS and incubated at 37 °C for either 3 or 21 h. Reactions were immediately stopped by the addition of 2 μl of CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). In Fig. 1, up to 400 ng of purified pIgA or SIgA was mixed in a final volume of 20 μl with SDS-sample buffer (100 mm Tris base, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) containing 100 mm dithiothreitol (Applichem, Darmstadt, Germany). Samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min and subjected to electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels. For digests originating from the free or Ag-bound pIgA or SIgA, 40 ng (α chain detection) or 80 ng (κ chain detection) per lane was separated onto 10% or 18% polyacrylamide gels, respectively. After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and blocking for 1 h in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, proteins were detected by incubation for 1 h with the following Ab or combination of primary and secondary Ab in PBS-T 0.5% nonfat dry milk: goat anti-human α chain IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1/3000; Sigma); goat anti-mouse IgA diluted 1/3000 (α chain-specific; Sigma) and rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1/3000; Sigma); rabbit anti-human κ chain antiserum (1/2000; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/3000; Sigma); goat anti-mouse κ chain IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Exalpha Biologicals, Watertown, MA); rabbit anti-hSC diluted 1/3000 (15Rindisbacher L.

After washing with PBS-T, membranes were developed with appropriate secondary Ab coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins on membranes were detected by chemiluminescence using Uptilight detection kit (Interchim, Montluçon, France) and exposed on autoradiographic films (Konica, Hevac Product, Villeneuve, Switzerland). 96-well plates (Nunc-immuno Plate Maxisorp surface; Nalge Nunc International, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with a range of 20–40 ng of either Ab, IC, or Ag in a final volume of 100 μl of coating buffer (PBS or NaHCO3 (pH 9.6)) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS-T, wells were blocked with PBS-T containing 1% of bovine serum albumin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) for 1 h at room temperature. Detection of human or mouse α- and κ chains was carried out for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl/well of the same primary/secondary Ab/antisera in PBS-T and 1% bovine serum albumin used in Western blot assays. After final washes, revelation was performed with a 0.1 m citrate sodium solution (pH 5.0) containing 1 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) and 0.01% H2O2. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm with 620 nm as reference. The human promyelocytic cell line U937 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were plated in 75-cm2 plastic flasks containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin, at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/air incubator. The cells were subcultured every third day, at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml. 18 h prior to binding experiments, cells were stimulated with 10−8 m phorbol myristate acetate because this was shown to increase surface expression of FcαRI (22Moura I.C.

Transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells overexpressing the human pIgR were cultured to 90% confluence on 6-well plastic culture dishes as described previously (23Røe M. Norderhaug I.N. Brandtzaeg P. Johansen F.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6046-6052PubMed Google Scholar). U937 or MDCK cells were washed twice with PBS. 2 × 105 cells in 100 μl of PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum (PBS-S) were preincubated with 50 μg/ml human or mouse IgG for 30 min at 4 °C to mask FcγRs. After washing with cold PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of PBS-S containing 2 μg of fluorescein-labeled pIgA or SIgA or the same amount of IgA in the form of IC thereof. Unbound Ab or complexes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were gently detached with a rubber policeman, allowing for viability above 90%, as determined by trypan blue staining. For binding inhibition studies, U937 cells were preincubated with 1 μg of anti-FcαRI mAb MIP8a (AbD Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany), and MDCK cells with 10 μl of rabbit antiserum to hSC prior to the addition of fluorescent IgA or IC. Cell-associated fluorescence intensity was evaluated by flow cytometry (FACScan flow cytometer; Becton-Dickinson). U937 and MDCK cell-associated radioactivity was determined. Moles of bound pIgAPCG-4, SIgAPCG-4, or IC formed with the toxin A were calculated, and equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) and number of binding sites per cell were determined by Scatchard analysis (24Kaetzel C.S. Robinson J.K. Chintalacharuvu K.R. Vaerman J.P. Lamm M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 8796-8800Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5. For all data, an unpaired Student' t test was applied, and the limit of significance was set at p = 0.05. To examine the consequences of the binding of Ag of various nature (protein, virus, bacterium) on IgA structure, we generated cognate monoclonal Ab in the two molecular forms relevant for mucosal immunity, i.e. pIgA and SIgA. Purified pIgA (IgAPCG-4, IgA7D9, and IgAC5) was analyzed by immunodetection following separation on polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1). Proper assembly and integrity of the molecules were checked using antisera specific for the α chain (lanes 1, 4, and 7) and the J chain (lanes 2, 5, and 8), which is essential for the association of the pIgA with SC. A combination of equimolar amounts of purified pIgA and hSC (IgAPCG-4) or mSC (IgA7D9 and IgAC5) for 1 h at room temperature resulted in the formation of covalent heterodimer complexes, as indicated by the detection of shifted SC to the position of pIgA (lanes 3, 6, and 9) when the protein was analyzed under nonreducing conditions. As reported previously, the percentage of covalence varied from one pIgA to another (11Stubbe H. Berdoz J. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Lüllau E. Heyse S. Vogel H. Marison I. von Stockar U. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16300-16309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as reflected by the appearance of free SC migrating as a band of 80 kDa. When loaded onto a molecular sieving column run in PBS, co-elution of SC and pIgA confirmed that the two proteins were indeed associated in the form of covalent and noncovalent SIgA complexes (15Rindisbacher L. Cottet S. Wittek R. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14220-14228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We have reported that binding of SC to pIgA protects the Ab from in vitro degradation by intestinal washes mimicking the protease-rich environment found in vivo (6Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used the same technical approach to evaluate the impact of C. difficile toxin A binding on the sensitivity of pIgAPCG-4 and SIgAPCG-4, as reflected by the appearance of α and κ chain degradation products assayed by immunodetection (Fig. 2, A and B). In time course experiments, the susceptibility of SIgAPCG-4 to intestinal washes was reduced compared with pIgAPCG-4, with integral α chain (62 kDa band) recovered after 21 h of incubation in addition to degradation products of 40 and 36 kDa (Fd fragment). Upon association with the toxin A Ag, the pattern of digestion of the two molecular forms of the Ab was the same, with undegraded α chain detected at the 21-h end point. The C-terminal cleavage of the α chain, yielding the 36- and 40-kDa fragments, was shown to occur upon incubation with intestinal washes (6Crottet P. Corthésy B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5445-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), some distance away from the Fab domains. This suggests that the susceptibility of the protein is reduced through the preferential action of conformational changes rather than masking of sensitive sites. In contrast, the integrity of the κ chain was not affected under any experimental conditions, arguing intramolecular and toxin A-mediated steric hindrance ensuring protection against the action of proteases (Fig. 2B). Changes in conformation and topography in pIgA and SIgA molecules have been assessed by analyzing the immunoreactivity of the constituting polypeptides in the Ab (26Bakos M.A. Kurosky A. Woodard C.S. Denney R.M. Goldblum R.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 162-168PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we compared the reactivity of free and toxin A-bound pIgAPCG-4 and SIgAPCG-4 with antisera specific for either the α or the κ chains by ELISA (Fig. 2C). We chose to use polyclonal antisera to permit to map the overall effect of toxin A binding on the availability of linear and conformational epitopes. For both chains, a weak (16–18%) yet highly reproducible reduction in reactivity was detected upon toxin A binding. The effect was slightly reinforced in the presence of SC in the Ab molecule (23–25% reduction), possibly accounted for by the capacity of SC to bind with toxin A (19Perrier C. Sprenger N. Corthésy B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14280-14287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or masking of epitopes on the α chain. Together, this reflects changes directly associated with the impact of the bound Ag. Furthermore, the assay is complementary to that based on exposure to protease because it also implicates the κ chain in the process. We next investigated whether the variability in protease sensitivity and immunoreactivity of pIgA/SIgA we observed after association with a protein Ag would similarly occur in the context of Ag of much bigger sizes and thus epitopic complexity. In comparison with the “naked” Ab that remained degradable into low molecular mass α chain products, incubation of rotavirus with VP6 (surface-exposed virus protein 6)-specific pIgA7D9 or SIgA7D9 led to the demonstration that the Ab in either molecular form was almost fully protected against the action of proteases in intestinal washes (Fig. 3A). However, for this particular IgA, the addition of SC did not offer a better protection against proteases; this might be due to the low percentage of covalent interaction between SC and the α chain, or alternatively, to the intrinsic stability of IgA7D9 in the assay (Fig. 1). Together, these features may partially mask the impact of Ag binding in this assay. In support of a less reduced protective effect of SC associated with IgA7D9, reduction of the κ chain signal was observed after 21 h of incubation both in the absence and in the presence of SC. Tight interaction with globular rotavirus in a Fab-dependent manner maintained a stable level of κ chain comparable between lanes (Fig. 3B). A clearer picture could be drawn from the immunoreactivity assay. Compared with IgAPCG-4, more marked changes in the capacity to be recognized by a chain-specific antiserum were measured for pIgA7D9 (30% reduction) and SIgA7D9 (34%) (Fig. 3C). The decrease in α chain reactivity can be explained by reduced access to the IgA-associated epitopes as well as by conformational effects limiting productive interactions with the antiserum, both resulting from coating of the virus particle by the Ab. In pIgA7D9, κ chain in close proximity with the virus Ag displayed a reduction in reactivity (18%), favoring the masking hypothesis over distant structural changes in this case. In SIgA7D9, the drop in immunoreactivity reached 22%, in support of the spatial distribution of SC wrapping the constant domains of the protein (27Bonner A. Almogren A. Furtado P.B. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. Mucosal. Immunol. 2009; 2: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Comparison of free pIgA/SIgA and the corresponding IC made of a protein or a viral Ag indicates that close interaction between partners on one hand and induced subtle modifications in the Ab structure on the other hand are differently affected as a function of the Ab·Ag couple. We further challenged this notion by extending our analysis to the effect of associating S. flexneri to IgAC5 specific for the bacterial surface lipopolysaccharide. Upon Ag binding, both molecular forms of the IgA Ab behaved the same, with a mixture of undigested α chain and 36- and 40-kDa degradation products detected at the two time points (Fig. 4A). This contrasted with the pattern obtained in the absence of S. flexneri, where unexpectedly, it appeared that pronounced degradation of the Ab took place at 21 h irrespective of bound SC (Fig. 4A). Although some cross-reactivity between the anti-α chain Ab and S. flexneri proteins could be observed, its contribution to the specific signal could be neglected in terms of interpretation of the results. The stability of the κ chain was demonstrated under all experimental conditions (Fig. 4B). The immunoreactivity of the α chain was about the same between pIgA and SIgA (Fig. 4C), suggesting a loose, although covalent association of SC, consistent with the limited protection observed in Fig. 4A. In contrast, a 26% reduction of κ chain reactivity occurred upon association with SC; this might result from a particular folding of the Fab domains in SIgAC5 because the first molecular model for SIgA shows surface exposure of two of four κ chains (27Bonner A. Almogren A. Furtado P.B. Kerr M.A. Perkins S.J. Mucosal. Immunol. 2009; 2: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The combination of the bacterium with the Ab led to a marked drop in α chain immunoreactivity for both the polymeric (91%) and secretory (92%) forms of IgAC5. A slightly less pronounced reduction for κ chain was measured for pIgAC5 (81%) and SIgAC5 (86%). In complexes with S. flexneri, these changes could be caused by enhanced epitope density recognized by the IgAC5 Ab or, alternatively, by masking of proteolytic sites in the α and κ chain. Results obtained by exposure to intestinal washes and immunoreactivity argue in favor of multiple consequences on the structure of the pIgA/SIgA Ab molecules following interaction with Ag of various sizes and nature. At the biochemical level, these combined approaches led us to conclude on the dichotomy between structural"

We asked whether modulation of these same signaling events extends to epithelial cells, a minimally phagocytic cell type. We used BU.MPT cells, a mouse kidney epithelial cell line, as our primary model, but we also evaluated several epithelial cell lines of distinct tissue origins. Like mϕ, mouse kidney epithelial cells recognized apoptotic and necrotic targets through distinct non-competing receptors, albeit with lower binding capacity and markedly reduced phagocytosis. Also, modulation of inflammatory activity and MAPK-dependent signaling by apoptotic and necrotic targets was indistinguishable in kidney epithelial cells and mϕ.

In kidney epithelial cells, modulation of Akt was linked to target cell recognition, independently of phagocytosis, whereas in mϕ, modulation was linked to phagocytosis.

The chromatin structure of lymphocytes undergoes a dramatic change when the lymphocytes receive an activating antigenic signal. Naïve resting cells contain small and compact nuclei with dense heterochromatin. In contrast, activated lymphocytes contain enlarged nuclei that are largely composed of euchromatin. After activation, T lymphocytes express immediate early genes, including the genes for transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun, NFAT, c-Myc, and NF-κB (1Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J.

The expression of these transcription factors induces the expression of additional genes that ultimately lead to the proliferation, differentiation, and effector function of T lymphocytes. Although the underlying mechanisms of these lymphocyte activation-induced rapid and dramatic changes in chromatin structure have not been elucidated, it is possible that several chromatin-remodeling complexes are involved in this process. Notably, the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex has been shown to rapidly associate with chromatin after T cell receptor signaling (4Zhao K. Wang W. Rando O.J. Xue Y. Swiderek K. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is an evolutionarily conserved multisubunit complex that uses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to modify nucleosomes and remodel chromatin structures. The SWI/SNF complex consists of 9–11 subunits; the actual number of subunits depends on the tissue and cell type. BRG1, BRM, BAF47/SNF5, BAF155/SRG3, and BAF170 are known to be the core components of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex (5Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the SWI/SNF complex plays an important role in the proliferation of peripheral T lymphocytes. In vitro antigen stimulation induces the binding of SWI/SNF complexes to the chromatin in lymphocytes (4Zhao K. Wang W. Rando O.J. Xue Y. Swiderek K. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R.

Muegge K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Lsh is a member of the SNF2 subfamily of helicases, which also includes BRG1. Moreover, effector CD4+ T cells that show changes in the chromatin structure at the cytokine gene loci show higher rates of cytokine gene transcription in comparison with the transcription in naïve cells (9Letimier F.A.

When naïve CD4+ T cells differentiate into either Th1 or Th2 effector cells, the chromatin structures of the interferon (IFN)-γ locus and the interleukin (IL)-4 locus, which are expressed in Th1 or Th2 cells, respectively, undergo epigenetic modifications (11Lee G.R.

The transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) is one of the earliest transcription factors induced in T cell activation. AP-1 is a dimer of the Fos and/or Jun proteins, and it regulates the expression of a broad variety of genes (12Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). The target genes of AP-1 play important roles in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (13Zenz R. Eferl R. Scheinecker C. Redlich K. Smolen J. Schonthaler H.B. Kenner L. Tschachler E. Wagner E.F. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2008; 10: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The expression of AP-1 is tightly linked to mitogenic stimulation, and this finding suggests that AP-1 performs essential functions in cell proliferation. Indeed, fibroblasts from c-Jun−/− embryos show completely defective proliferation (14Johnson R.S. van Lingen B. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). AP-1 regulates cell proliferation by inducing the transcription of the genes involved in cell cycle progression, such as cyclin D1, or by repressing the expression of negative regulators of the cell cycle, such as p53 and p16INK4A (13Zenz R. Eferl R. Scheinecker C. Redlich K. Smolen J. Schonthaler H.B. Kenner L. Tschachler E. Wagner E.F. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2008; 10: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). AP-1 is essential for the expression of the IL-2 gene in response to TCR/CD28 stimulation; therefore, AP-1 is intimately involved in T cell proliferation (15Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 16Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). AP-1 has been also shown to be involved in the inflammatory response and the expression of many cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ, is activated by AP-1 (13Zenz R. Eferl R.

AP-1 and other transcription factors such as NF-κB and NFAT have been implicated in several T cell-related chronic inflammatory diseases. Indeed, patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) show increased AP-1 activity, and the mononuclear cells of lupus patients showed abnormal expressions of AP-1 and NF-κB (19Tsokos G.C.

Whereas previous studies have implicated the SWI/SNF complex in the activation and proliferation of T cells, the direct target or the precise mechanism of the SWI/SNF complex-mediated regulation of peripheral T cell activation are not known. In this study, we demonstrate that the SWI/SNF complex controls the expression of the transcription factor AP-1 during peripheral T cell activation. Thus, the SWI/SNF complex may regulate cytokine production and proliferation of activated T cells. Our results also suggest that the complex is associated with the development of autoimmune diseases. C57BL/6 SRG3 transgenic (CD2-SRG3) mice were obtained by using previously described methods (23Han S. Choi H. Ko M.G. Choi Y.I. Sohn D.H. Kim J.K. Shin D. Chung H. Lee H.W. Kim J.B. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. The mice were bred and maintained under pathogen-free conditions, and the experiments were performed in accordance with institutional and national guidelines. The EL4 cell line was cultured in Iscove’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The L7 cell line was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using the Gene Pulse-II RF electroporator (Bio-Rad). Reporter assays were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize the luciferase results. Lymphocytes were isolated from the spleen and the lymph nodes of 4–8-week-old mice. For flow cytometry, the cells were stained with antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Routine fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis was performed on a FACSCantoII (Becton Dickinson) system. Intracellular staining and BrdU incorporation were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols (BD Pharmingen). Antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased from BD Pharmingen. To obtain peripheral CD4+ T cells (>90% pure) for proliferation assays and biochemical analyses, we performed negative selection on an AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotech). The GFP+-infected cells were sorted using FACSAria (Becton Dickinson). SRG3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (sequence, 5′-CATCCTGGTTTGATTATAA-3′) was cloned into an MDH1 retroviral vector. We prepared similar MDH1-shRNA constructs for BRG1 (sequence 5′-CCGTCAAGGTGAAGATCAA-3′) and Jun (sequence 5′-CAGCTTCCTGCCTTTGTAA-3′). Phoenix-eco cells were transfected with an empty MDH1 vector and either MDH1-shSRG, MDH1- shBrg1, or MDH1-shJun cDNA, and the culture supernatant containing high titers of retrovirus was collected 48 h after the transfection. Negatively purified CD4+ T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (2 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. The activated T cells were cultured in 1 ml of a retroviral supernatant containing 5 mg/ml polybrene (Sigma), centrifuged at 2600 rpm for 90 min at room temperature, and incubated for 48 h. The infected T cells were allowed to proliferate for 2 days in the presence of recombinant IL-2 (20 units/ml); then, they were restimulated for intracellular cytokine analysis or BrdU incorporation. In some experiments, the transduced cells were purified by cell sorting with a FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences). Total RNA from the cultured cells was purified by TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 μg of RNA and the SuperScriptIII RT System (Invitrogen). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) with the 2× SYBR Green MasterMix (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA (4 μl) was amplified in a 25 μl of PCR mixture containing 0.25 μm of the respective primers by using the following parameters: denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C and 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s annealing for 1 min, and extension at 60 °C. The sequences of the primer pairs are shown in supplemental Table S1. Purified T cells (105 cells/well in 96-well round bottom plates) were incubated either with medium alone, with plate-bound anti-CD3 (0.5–5 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml), or with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (125 ng/ml). The cells were cultured for 48 h and labeled with 1 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine for 16 h. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured using a MicroBeta JET (PerkinElmer). For the suppression assays, 105 responder CD4+CD25− T cells from each mouse were plated in 96-well plates. The indicated ratios of the sorted CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were added to each plate. The APCs consisted of splenocytes depleted of T cells and treated with mitomycin C. The cells were activated by ConA treatment for 48 h, labeled with 1 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine for 16 h, and proliferation was detected using the technique described above. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-(35–55) (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) was synthesized by Peptron (Seoul, Korea). Female C57BL/6 SRG3 transgenic (CD2-SRG3) and WT littermate mice (age 8–12 weeks) received subcutaneous injections of 200 μg of the peptide in 100 μl of sterile PBS emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund’s adjuvant (Difco) containing 4 mg/ml of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Difco). The mice also received an intravenous injection of 200 ng of Bordetella pertussis toxin (Sigma) in 100 μl of sterile PBS at the time of immunization, and another injection was administered 48 h later. Each day, the mice were scored for signs of clinical disease by using the following scale: 0, no signs of disease; 1, weakness of tail; 2, partial hind limb paralysis; 3, complete hind limb paralysis; 4, forelimb paralysis; 5, death. Mouse cages were coded, and individual mice were scored blindly. Primary CD4+ T cells were either kept unstimulated or stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. The nuclear extracts were prepared by using a previously described protocol (24Jeong S.M. Lee K.Y. Shin D. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34373-34379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A specific amount (2 μg) of each extract was used in each reaction. A 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 consensus site (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′) was used as a probe. For the detection of specific protein-DNA complexes, antibodies to c-Fos (sc-253X) and c-Jun (sc-1694X) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For the ChIP assays, EL4 cells were briefly fixed with formaldehyde, rinsed, and lysed. The samples were sonicated to a mean DNA length of 200–1000 bp, and the sonicated cell supernatants were diluted in dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and protease inhibitors (Roche)). To reduce nonspecific background phenomena, the cell supernatant was precleared by using 80 μl of a salmon sperm DNA/protein A agarose (50%:50%) slurry (Millipore) for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. Then, immunoprecipitation assays were performed at 4 °C overnight with 1 μg of normal mouse IgG, anti-SRG3, or anti-Brg1 antibodies. Immune complexes were collected using 60 μl of the salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. The beads were washed with a low salt buffer (0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), with high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and twice with TE buffer. The histone complexes were eluted by adding elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Then, 20 μl of 5 m NaCl were added to the pooled supernatants and the histione-DNA cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h. DNA fragments were purified with the QIAquick Spin kit (Qiagen, CA). IP products were amplified using primers within the c-Fos and c-Jun promoter regions: c-Fos (sense, 5′-TGTATGCCAAGACGGGGGTT-3′; antisense, 5′-AGAGCAGAGCTGGGTGGGAG-3′), c-Jun (sense, 5′-CGGGCGCGCGCCTGTGTGCA-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCTTGTGTTCCCGGGTTCC-3′). SRG3 (SWI3-related gene), a murine homolog of human BAF155, is a core component of the murine SWI/SNF complex (25Jeon S.H. Kang M.G. Kim Y.H. Jin Y.H. Lee C. Chung H.Y. Kwon H. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SRG3 functions as a scaffolding protein that controls the stability of the SWI/SNF complex by directly interacting with the other major components of the complex (26Sohn D.H. Lee K.Y. Lee C. Oh J. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10614-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, any alteration in the expression of SRG3 causes changes in the overall level of the SWI/SNF complex and the activity of the complex (26Sohn D.H. Lee K.Y. Lee C. Oh J. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10614-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Lee K.Y. Choi Y.I. Kim J. Choi J.W. Sohn D.H. Lee C. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 7088-7096Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In the transgenic mice that constitutively expressed SRG3 in the T lineage cells under the control of the human CD2 promoter (CD2-SRG3 mice), the expression of SRG3 in the peripheral T cells was 2-fold up-regulated in comparison with the expression in wild-type T cells (23Han S. Choi H. Ko M.G. Choi Y.I. Sohn D.H. Kim J.K. Shin D. Chung H. Lee H.W. Kim J.B. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in these mice, the levels of the other SWI/SNF components, including BRG1, SNF5, and BAF60a, were up-regulated, and the chromatin-remodeling activity had increased (26Sohn D.H. Lee K.Y. Lee C. Oh J. Chung H. Jeon S.H. Seong R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10614-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We observed that the levels of c-Fos and c-Jun transcripts in the naïve CD4+ T cells from the CD2-SRG3 transgenic mice were higher than the levels of these transcripts in the CD4+ T cells from the littermate control mice (Fig. 1A). When the T cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin, we observed a significant increase in the mRNA- (c-Fos, 2.5-fold increase; c-Jun, 2.3-fold increase) and protein level (c-Fos, 2.1-fold increase; c-Jun, 2.4-fold increase) expressions of these transcription factors in the CD4+ T cells from CD2-SRG3 mice, in comparison with the corresponding expressions in the cells from control mice (Fig. 1, A and B and supplemental Fig. S1). The expression of NF-κB (p50) also slightly increased in the CD2-SRG3 CD4+ T cells (1.7-fold increase). In contrast, the expressions of NFATc and NFATp were similar in the CD4+ T cells from transgenic and control mice. To determine whether the increased expression of AP-1 resulted in an increase in its transcriptional activity, we performed a gel mobility-shift assay. As seen in Fig. 1C, stimulation with PMA and ionomycin induce a significant increase in the AP-1 activity in the CD4+ T cells from CD2-SRG3 mice, in comparison with the corresponding levels in control cells. To confirm the role of the SWI/SNF complex in AP-1 expression, the SRG3 expression was decreased by transduction of retroviral vectors carrying a SRG3-targeting short hairpin sequence (shSRG3). Transduction of a shSRG3-encoding retrovirus into thymoma cell lines led to substantial depletion of SRG3 expression, in comparison with the expression in the controls (EL4 cells, 70% decrease; L7 cells, 75% decrease; data not shown). The expression of c-Fos and c-Jun in the EL4 and L7 thymoma cells that were transduced with the silencing construct were markedly lower than the expression in the cells transduced with a control vector (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the DNA binding activity of AP-1 in the shSRG3-expressing EL4 and L7 thymoma cells was lower than that in the control cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, when purified normal CD4+ T cells were infected with the retroviral construct, shSRG3 expression induced a reduction in the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun transcripts, in comparison with the expression in the control cells (Fig. 2C). Additionally, down-regulation of Brg1, the core ATPase component of the SWI/SNF complex, by RNA interference (shBRG1) also induced substantial depletion of c-Fos and c-Jun transcripts in the CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, we observed lower levels of NF-κB transcripts in the shSRG3- or shBRG1-expressing cells. Next, we investigated whether the SWI/SNF complex is required for AP-1 expression in other cell types. NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells were transduced with shSRG3 or shBRG1, and the cells were cultured without serum for 24 h. Then, serum was added, and AP-1 expression was measured. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 2D, we observed a reduction in the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun transcripts in the cells that were transduced with shSRG3 or shBRG1. Collectively, these results suggest that the SWI/SNF complex regulates the expression and DNA binding activity of the AP-1 transcription factor. It is known that the SWI/SNF complex regulates the expression of target genes by altering their chromatin structure. Therefore, to determine whether the SWI/SNF complex controls AP-1 expression by modifying the chromatin structures of c-Fos and c-Jun promoters, we performed ChIP assays using EL4 and L7 cells. Notably, SRG3 was found to associate with the c-Fos and c-Jun promoters in unstimulated cells, and although the total SRG3 protein level remained the same after stimulation, the recruitment of SRG3 to the promoters significantly increased (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The c-Fos and c-Jun promoters were also found to associate with Brg1, and this association substantially increased after stimulation. Furthermore, similar recruitment patterns were observed when chromatin from naïve CD4+ T cells was compared with samples from activated cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the SWI/SNF complex regulates AP-1 expression by modifying the chromatin structure of the AP-1 promoter region. AP-1 and NF-κB are inducible transcription factors involved in cytokine production and proliferation of T cells. We observed that the SWI/SNF complex controls the expression of AP-1 in the peripheral T cells; therefore, it is likely that the complex affects proliferation and cytokine production in T cells. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the T cell proliferations in 6–8-week-old SRG3 transgenic mice in response to various stimulations. Peripheral T cells from CD2-SRG3 mice and wild-type littermates were purified and stimulated with ConA in the presence of APCs. The proliferation in the T cells derived from CD2-SRG3 mice was higher than that in the cells derived from wild-type mice (Fig. 4A). The CD4+ and CD4+CD25− T cells purified from the CD2-SRG3 mice proliferated to a greater extent than those from the control mice. Even in the absence of APCs, CD4+ T cells from the CD2-SRG3 mice displayed increased proliferation in response to either anti-CD3 alone or anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (Fig. 4B). PMA and ionomycin stimulate the pathways mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium signaling, and can bypass the requirements for early TCR signaling. To test whether the SWI/SNF complex regulates T cell activation by affecting the downstream factors of PKC and the calcium signaling pathways, we analyzed the proliferation of T cells in response to PMA and ionomycin. Activation by treatment with PMA and ionomycin also resulted in increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in the CD4+ T cells from CD2-SRG3 mice (Fig. 4C). IL-2 is a key growth factor for the proliferation of T cells. The IL-2 expression in the T cells from CD2-SRG3 mice was significantly higher than that in the T cells from control mice (Fig. 4D). To exclude the possibility that the increased thymidine uptake by the T cells from CD2-SRG3 mice was due to reduction in cell death as opposed to accelerated proliferation, we investigated the level of cell death induced by the anti-CD3 treatment. We found that the percentage of annexin V-expressing T cells in CD2-SRG3 mice was only slightly higher than that in control mice (Fig. 4E). Next, we examined the effects of constitutive expression of the SWI/SNF complex on cytokine production in peripheral CD4+ T cells. Purified CD4+ T cells from CD2-SRG3 transgenic mice and littermate control mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies or PMA and ionomycin in the presence of Golgistop, and the activated cells were stained with antibodies against various cytokines. The IFN-γ- and IL-4-producing cell fractions in the CD4+ T cells from CD2-SRG3 mice were significantly higher than those in the cells from wild-type mice (Fig. 4F). Thus, these results show that the increased expression of the SWI/SNF complex amplified peripheral T cell proliferation and cytokine production. We next examined the activation status of CD4+ T cells in wild-type and CD2-SRG3 mice by analyzing the expression of activation markers. In older (5 months or more) mice, CD4+ T cells from CD2-SRG3 showed an increased expression of CD25, CD69, and CD44 compared with those from wild-type mice. These changes were not apparent in younger (4–6-week-old) mice (supplemental Fig. S2). These data suggest that there are increased numbers of activated or memory CD4+ T cells in aged CD2-SRG3 mice compared with normal mice. To further confirm the role of the SWI/SNF complex in peripheral T cell activation, we analyzed the T cell proliferation and cytokine production after the depletion of the SWI/SNF complex. Purified normal CD4+ T cells were activated to allow retrovirus-mediated transduction, and the expression of SRG3 was decreased by the transduction of shSRG3-carrying retroviral vectors. Then, the transduced CD4+ T cells were restimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 18 h and pulse-labeled with BrdU for 1 h. The population of the BrdU-incorporating cells among the CD4+ T cells transduced with the shSRG3-retrovirus was lower than that among the control cells (Fig. 5A, upper panel). BAF57 is the DNA-binding subunit of the SWI/SNF complex. BAF57ΔN, which is a dominant-negative form of BAF57, lacks the DNA-binding domain of BAF57 (28Chi T.H. Wan M. Zhao K. Taniuchi I. Chen L. Littman D.R. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). When BAF57ΔN was used in transduction experiments, the T cell proliferation was lower than that in the control (Fig. 5A, low panel). Similarly, EL4 thymoma cells transduced with shSRG3 grew more slowly than the control cells (data not shown). To explore the role of the SWI/SNF complex on IL-2 expression, purified CD4+ T cells"
https://openalex.org/W2020178978,"The central paradox of schizophrenia genetics is that susceptibility genes are preserved in the human gene-pool against a strong negative selection pressure. Substantial evidence of epidemiology suggests that nuclear susceptibility genes, if present, should be sustained by mutation-selection balance without heterozygote advantage. Therefore, putative nuclear susceptibility genes for schizophrenia should meet special conditions for the persistence of the disease as well as the condition of bearing a positive association with the disease.We deduced two criteria that every nuclear susceptibility gene for schizophrenia should fulfill for the persistence of the disease under general assumptions of the multifactorial threshold model. The first criterion demands an upper limit of the case-control difference of the allele frequencies, which is determined by the mutation rate at the locus, and the prevalence and the selection coefficient of the disease. The second criterion demands an upper limit of odds ratio for a given allele frequency in the unaffected population. When we examined the top 30 genes at SZGene and the recently reported common variants on chromosome 6p with the criteria using the epidemiological data in a large-sampled Finnish cohort study, it was suggested that most of these are unlikely to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia. The criteria predict that the common disease/common variant hypothesis is unlikely to fit schizophrenia and that nuclear susceptibility genes of moderate effects for schizophrenia, if present, are limited to 'rare variants', 'very common variants', or variants with exceptionally high mutation rates.If we assume the nuclear DNA model for schizophrenia, it should have many susceptibility genes of exceptionally high mutation rates; alternatively, it should have many disease-associated resistance genes of standard mutation rates on different chromosomes. On the other hand, the epidemiological data show that pathogenic genes, if located in the mitochondrial DNA, could persist through sex-related mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2068505576,"Background Crohn's Disease (CD) is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Although its pathogenesis is complex, we have recently shown that CD patients have a systemic defect in macrophage function, which results in the defective clearance of bacteria from inflammatory sites. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have identified a number of additional macrophage defects in CD following diacylglycerol (DAG) homolog phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) activation. We provide evidence for decreased DNA fragmentation, reduced mitochondrial membrane depolarization, impaired reactive oxygen species production, diminished cytochrome c release and increased IL-6 production compared to healthy subjects after PMA exposure. The observed macrophage defects in CD were stimulus-specific, as normal responses were observed following p53 activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Conclusion These findings add to a growing body of evidence highlighting disordered macrophage function in CD and, given their pivotal role in orchestrating inflammatory responses, defective apoptosis could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of CD."
https://openalex.org/W2066846031,"Previously we have identified the lipid mediator sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) as the first potentially endogenous inhibitor of the ubiquitous Ca2+ sensor calmodulin (CaM) (Kovacs, E., and Liliom, K. (2008) Biochem. J. 410, 427–437). Here we give mechanistic insight into CaM inhibition by SPC, based on fluorescence stopped-flow studies with the model CaM-binding domain melittin. We demonstrate that both the peptide and SPC micelles bind to CaM in a rapid and reversible manner with comparable affinities. Furthermore, we present kinetic evidence that both species compete for the same target site on CaM, and thus SPC can be considered as a competitive inhibitor of CaM-target peptide interactions. We also show that SPC disrupts the complex of CaM and the CaM-binding domain of ryanodine receptor type 1, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1, and the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump. By interfering with these interactions, thus inhibiting the negative feedback that CaM has on Ca2+ signaling, we hypothesize that SPC could lead to Ca2+ mobilization in vivo. Hence, we suggest that the action of the sphingolipid on CaM might explain the previously recognized phenomenon that SPC liberates Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Moreover, we demonstrate that unlike traditional synthetic CaM inhibitors, SPC disrupts the complex between not only the Ca2+-saturated but also the apo form of the protein and the target peptide, suggesting a completely novel regulation for target proteins that constitutively bind CaM, such as ryanodine receptors.

It plays a central role in cellular signaling, regulating the activity of numerous proteins, including kinases, phosphatases, ion channels, and pumps. Vertebrate CaM is a small (148 residue), acidic (pI 4.1), highly conserved protein comprised of four Ca2+-binding α-helical EF-hand motifs. The first two EF-hands combine to form a globular N-terminal domain separated by a short flexible linker from a highly homologous C-terminal domain consisting of the remaining EF-hands (2Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+ leads to structural rearrangements that result in exposure of hydrophobic groups in a methionine-rich crevice of each domain (3LaPorte D.C. Wierman B.M. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3814-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).

We provide a detailed kinetic model for Ca2+-saturated CaM binding to its targets, and we show that SPC is a strong competitive inhibitor of CaM-target peptide complexes. Our in vitro results give a plausible explanation to how SPC can lead to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in vivo.

Fluorescence time courses were recorded using an SX-20 (Applied Photophysics, UK) stopped-flow apparatus having 2-ms dead time. Dansyl fluorescence was excited at 340 nm and emission was selected with a 455-nm long-pass filter.

Bandwidths were set to 5 nm. Dansyl was excited at 340 nm, emission was monitored from 400 to 600 nm. Dansyl-CaM titration with melittin was carried out at 0.2 μm dansyl-CaM and the resulting curve was fitted with the above quadratic equation. When screening with lipids SPC, S1P, LPC, LPA, and LT-SPC, dansyl-CaM, RyR peptide, and lipid concentrations were 0.2, 0.5, and 100 μm, respectively. When measuring dose response for SPC, dansyl-CaM and RyR peptide concentrations were 0.2 and 0.5 μm, respectively, and the SPC concentration varied between 10 and 100 μm. In the complimentary set of experiments, the Trp residue of the RyR peptide was excited at 295 nm, and spectra were recorded from 310 to 400 nm. RyR peptide and CaM (unlabeled) concentrations were both 1 μm. In screening experiments, lipid concentrations were 100 μm, while measuring the dose response, SPC concentration varied between 10 and 100 μm. Experiments with dansyl-labeled apoCaM were carried out similarly to measurements with Ca2+-saturated CaM, only in buffer containing 1 mm EGTA instead of 1 mm CaCl2. Measurements with peptides derived from the IP3R1 and the PMCA were conducted as in the case of the RyR peptide. Mixed micelles were prepared by mixing the methanolic stock solutions of the two lipids, and then adding them to the appropriate assay buffer. Each spectrum was corrected for corresponding lipid, protein, peptide, and buffer effects by subtracting a matching buffer scan. The CaM-melittin complex is a widely used model to study the interaction between CaM and the effector proteins it regulates (34Comte M. Maulet Y. Cox J.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The details of the CaM-melittin binding mechanism, nevertheless, have not been revealed before to the degree we needed to study a composite system with both putative CaM binding partners, SPC and melittin, present. Previous kinetic studies focused on the mutual effect of Ca2+ and target peptide binding to CaM (35Brown S.E. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 36Murase T. Iio T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1618-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and did not aim at characterizing the CaM-peptide interaction at saturating Ca2+ concentration. Therefore, we performed melittin binding experiments both by equilibrium and transient kinetic methods using the fluorescence of dansyl-CaM. Dansyl labeling was performed in conditions to produce a 1:1 homogeneous labeling to avoid artifacts in the transient kinetics experiments. Time courses of fluorescence change after mixing dansyl-CaM with melittin are biphasic (Fig. 1A) indicating at least two biochemical transitions both characterized by the expected fluorescence increase (based upon previously determined spectral changes (37Lucas J.L. Wang D. Sadée W. Pharm. Res. 2006; 23: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Turner J.H. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30741-30750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) upon binding. Time courses were analyzed by double exponential fitting. The concentration dependence of the observed rate constants of the two phases (Fig. 1B) suggests that the fast phase is a second-order reaction followed by a slow first-order reaction reflecting some conformational reorganization of the CaM-melittin complex (k2,obs,M = 49 ± 13 s−1, Table 2). The association rate constant of the second-order reaction was determined from the linear phase of the kobs versus concentration curve, in which range the pseudo first-order approximation applies (k+1,M = 1004 ± 366 μm−1 s−1, Table 2). The dissociation rate constant could not be reliably extracted from the linear fit because of the large uncertainty of the y intercept. We could extract the dissociation constant of the first process of the binding from the concentration dependence of the fast phase amplitude (Fig. 1C, Kd1,M = 0.3 ± 0.15 μm, Table 2). The total amplitude describing the entire binding process is analogous to equilibrium binding data and yielded Kd1–2,M = 0.067 ± 0.044 μm. Consistently, equilibrium fluorescence titration of dansyl-CaM with melittin in a fluorimeter yielded Kd,eq,M = 0.054 ± 0.016 μm (Fig. 1D, Table 2) close to the previous Kd1–2,M value within error. Taking Equations 2 and 3 (derived in the supplemental equations) and Kd1–2,M into consideration, we calculated all remaining parameters of the two-step binding process summarized in Scheme 1. k2,obs,M=k+2,M+k-2,M(Eq. 2) Keq,M=Kd1,M1+K2,M(Eq. 3) Using the kinetic parameters in Scheme 1, we ran numerical simulations for the time courses shown in Fig. 1A to test the validity of our model. To model the experimentally observed time courses, we assumed that the two high fluorescence states have similar intensities and thus the observed fluorescence reflects the sum of the concentrations of the two populations (** in Scheme 1 and Fig. 8). The simulated time courses were subjected to the same analysis procedures as the experimental data. As a result, kobs values showed good agreement with the experimentally obtained ones (Fig. 1B) indicating that the established CaM-ME binding model is consistent with our experimental data.SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 8Schematic representation of the model by which SPC competes for CaM with target peptides.

Fluorescence time courses upon mixing dansyl-CaM with various concentrations of SPC proved to be extremely fast and yielded only small fluorescence changes. Even at the lowest SPC concentration the course of fluorescence change was lost in the 2-ms dead time of the stopped-flow apparatus and is therefore not shown. We can only put a lower estimate on the association rate constant (k+1,S > 40 μm−1 s−1, Table 2). Our previous observations suggested that the species interacting with CaM is the micelle not the monomer (14Kovacs E. Liliom K. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Above the critical micelle concentration (CMC = 33 ± 2 μm (14Kovacs E. Liliom K. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)) the fluorescence intensity change upon binding became completely saturated. As a result of these SPC binding experiments we conclude that Ca2+-saturated CaM binding to SPC is fast and saturated above the CMC, which is relevant for designing the competition experiments. We reacted pre-mixed dansyl-CaM-melittin complexes with various concentrations of SPC to investigate whether these two ligands compete with each other for the same CaM target site. Luckily, formation of the two different dansyl-CaM complexes display opposite fluorescence changes and thus transformation of one complex to the other is expected to be accompanied by a large signal change (CaM·ME** → CaM·SPC). The large fluorescence decrease upon mixing indicated that SPC replaced the previously bound melittin on dansyl-CaM (Fig. 2A). Time courses could be fitted with one (1st data point), two (2nd data point), or three exponentials. The slower kinetic phases have smaller amplitudes that may explain why they go unseen when the total amplitude is relatively small (first data points). The first, concentration-dependent, fast phase corresponds to SPC binding to dansyl-CaM and is characterized by a cooperative amplitude saturation curve (Fig. 2B), which probably reflects micelle formation (parameters in Table 2). As previously observed, above the CMC the fluorescence change becomes saturated. The kobs of the fast phase saturates at about 350 s−1 (Fig. 2C, k1,sat,SC in Table 2), close to the value of the rate constant estimated for CaM-melittin dissociation (k−1,M = 301 s−1, see Scheme 1). The first-order rate constant observed for the second phase (k2,obs,SC = 14 ± 6 s−1) is also almost equal to k−2,M (11 s−1, Scheme 1) in the melittin binding mechanism. These observations imply that SPC binding to CaM is limited by the dissociation of melittin. The initially melittin-saturated dansyl-CaM-melittin complex (mostly populated in the dCaM·ME** state in Scheme 1) must go through the kinetic steps characterized by k−2,M and k−1,M before SPC can associate with CaM. The apparent SPC-CaM association (k+1,SC = 2.4 ± 0.2 μm−1 s−1) is not as fast as in the case of SPC binding to pure dansyl-CaM because melittin re-binding occurs and the observed rates are set as a function of the concentration ratios and kinetic parameters of the two ligands. A third kinetic phase with a slow observed rate constant of k3,obs,SC = 0.9 ± 0.3 s−1 and an 18% relative amplitude appears at [SPC] > CMC possibly due to a conformational change in the dansyl-CaM-micelle complex. We also carried out the reverse chasing experiment in which dansyl-CaM saturated with SPC was mixed with various concentrations of melittin (Fig. 3). We again expected large fluorescence changes, a fluorescence increase this time, because SPC exchanges to melittin on dansyl-CaM (CaM·SPC → CaM·ME**). Time courses followed double exponentials (Fig. 3A) and the fluorescence change exhibited hyperbolic saturation with an apparent dissociation constant of 1 μm (Fig. 3B, Kd1–2,MC = 1.0 ± 0.3 μm, Table 2). The observed rate constants of both phases were dependent on melittin concentration in the measured concentration range (Fig. 3C). The fast phase exhibited a saturating character and could be fitted with a hyperbole that saturates at k1,sat,MC = 59 ± 13 s−1. This rate constant likely originates from the one observed for the second process in melittin binding that is in the same range within error (k+2, M + k−2,M = 49 ± 13 s−1). At infinite melittin concentration, the initial binding of melittin (characterized by k+1,M × [CaM]) will be fast and saturated, thus, the entire binding process will be limited by the second, slower kinetic step. The apparent half-maximal saturation of the fast phase (K1(app)MC = 5.4 ± 3.4 μm) is the result of an interplay between the three reversible processes shown in Fig. 8 and it appears to be close to the equilibrium constant calculated for the second CaM-melittin binding step. The slow phase (4–8 s−1) represents the smaller portion of the total amplitude. On the basis of our parallel binding model (Fig. 8), it should originate from the dissociation of the CaM-micelle complex (consistently with the relatively small signal change observed upon the CaM-SPC interaction) and is expected to reach saturation (kobs,sat = k−1,S). Because micelle binding to CaM was too fast to be measured, these observed rate constants are the only accessible parameters to indicate that k−1,S is relatively slow. We formulated a relationship between the thermodynamic parameters of CaM binding to either SPC or melittin and the apparent Kd-s of the chasing experiments (Equation 4; for details, see the supplemental equations). Kd(app)=Kc×LKL+Kc(Eq. 4) C represents the chaser, L represents the prebound ligand, and KL and KC indicate the dissociation constants for the ligand and the chaser. Substituting the previously determined values for KC (∼60 nm, Fig. 1, C and D, Kd1–2,M and Kd,eq,M in Table 2), Kd(app) (1 μm, Fig. 3B, and Kd1–2,MC in Table 2), and L (50 μm) into Equation 4, we calculate the experimentally inaccessible parameter, KL, to be 3 μm (in SPC monomer concentration). This corresponds to 3/n μm in SPC micelle concentration, where n is the number of monomers per micelle. We estimate the molecular ratio to be 100–200 monomers per micelle, 4E. Kovacs, V. Harmat, J. Tóth, B. G. Vértessy, K. Módos, J. Kardos, and K. Liliom, submitted for publication. which would imply that the Kd for the dansyl-CaM-micelle complex is 0.015–0.03 μm"

However, the role of p73 in the malignant process remains to be explored. We show here that p73 acts as a T cell-specific tumor suppressor in a genetically defined mouse model, and that concomitant ablation of p53 and p73 predisposes mice to an increased incidence of thymic lymphomas compared to the loss of p53 alone. Our results demonstrate a causal role for loss of p73 in progression of T cell lymphomas to the stage of aggressive, disseminated disease. We provide evidence that tumorigenesis in mice lacking p53 and p73 proceeds through mechanisms involving altered patterns of gene expression, defects in early T cell development, impaired apoptosis, and the ensuing accumulation of chromosomal aberrations. Collectively, our data imply that tumor suppressive properties of p73 are highly dependent on cellular context, wherein p73 plays a major role in T cell development and neoplasia."

https://openalex.org/W2078424229,"Disassembly of RecA protein subunits from a RecA filament has long been known to occur during DNA strand exchange, although its importance to this process has been controversial. An Escherichia coli RecA E38K/DeltaC17 double mutant protein displays a unique and pH-dependent mutational separation of DNA pairing and extended DNA strand exchange. Single strand DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis is catalyzed by this mutant protein nearly normally from pH 6 to 8.5. It will also form filaments on DNA and promote DNA pairing. However, below pH 7.3, ATP hydrolysis is completely uncoupled from extended DNA strand exchange. The products of extended DNA strand exchange do not form. At the lower pH values, disassembly of RecA E38K/DeltaC17 filaments is strongly suppressed, even when homologous DNAs are paired and available for extended DNA strand exchange. Disassembly of RecA E38K/DeltaC17 filaments improves at pH 8.5, whereas complete DNA strand exchange is also restored. Under these sets of conditions, a tight correlation between filament disassembly and completion of DNA strand exchange is observed. This correlation provides evidence that RecA filament disassembly plays a major role in, and may be required for, DNA strand exchange. A requirement for RecA filament disassembly in DNA strand exchange has a variety of ramifications for the current models linking ATP hydrolysis to DNA strand exchange."

But even as other nations seek to emulate the approach, domestic critics are calling into question its dominance over university life. A 20 year quantitative assessment of research in British universities has coincided with a renaissance in their international status. But even as other nations seek to emulate the approach, domestic critics are calling into question its dominance over university life. Christmas 2009 can't come quickly enough for senior British academics. This time last year, thanks to the release of the final results of the UK's Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), Christmas ended up canceled for many of them. The publication of the RAE results, craftily timed for December 18, 2008, ensured that British academics spent much of that particular festive season scouring detailed performance data profiles of every university department in the country (http://www.rae.ac.uk). These data were then used by the funding councils (The Higher Education Funding Council for England, HEFCE, and its three equivalent agencies in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) as the basis for distributing more than £1.5 billion, or about half of the money given to university research by the UK government in 2009. Under Britain's so-called “dual-support” system, the money from the funding councils provides a secure basis of support for researchers, who then bid to the seven research councils, including the Medical Research Council, for individual project grants. Unlike the grants, the funding council money comes to the universities' central administrative offices with few strings attached, making it all the more attractive to university vice-chancellors. “It's what you have if you don't have endowments,” explains David Eastwood, vice-chancellor of the University of Birmingham and former chief executive of HEFCE. Just as importantly, the RAE provides the universities with a solid, quantitative basis for their management decisions. Often, the data have become a mainstay of such decisions. That has brought the internationally admired system—now under major revision and set to re-emerge next year as the Research Excellence Framework (REF)—under surprisingly strident criticism at home. “We've become trapped in our own little self-reverential world of competition,” Nigel Thrift, vice-chancellor of the University of Warwick, told a conference on research assessment at the Royal Society in London on October 14 (http://www.hepi.ac.uk). “What started out as a quite sensible means of differentiation, which undoubtedly had real effects on quality, has become a damaging obsession with, I suspect, very little added value.” Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, one of Britain's newer universities, is even less charitable. “We've got a non-competitive system with pre-determined outcomes,” he told the meeting. “It obstructs planning and discourages risk-taking, discourages collaboration between institutions, and drives a wedge between teaching and research.” Such criticism matters because with a British general election likely next Spring, and widespread expectations that a new Conservative government will sweep into power, no one knows how much of the current plan for future research assessments will survive. The process for designing the new Research Excellence Framework or REF is well underway, but the ability of researchers to plan for it is inhibited by uncertainty over what form it will eventually take. Since the first RAE launched in 1986, and through subsequent iterations in 1989, 1992, 1996, 2001, and 2008, the process has steadily assumed momentum, sophistication, and international prestige. It began as an attempt by HEFCE's predecessor body, the University Grants Committee, to assure continued funding for research from the then-Conservative government but ended up helping to secure a windfall of public support for university research in the UK (Figure 1). This expansion—which has seen the UK science budget (which goes overwhelmingly to the universities) grow from £1.3 billion in 1997 to £3.7 billion this year—has been associated with a powerful revival in British academic research. A study undertaken for the UK government (International Comparative Performance of the UK Research Base) and published in September this year found that Britain produces more papers, and also more citations, per unit of expenditure than any other major economy (http://www.dius.gov.uk/science/science_funding/science_budget/uk_research_base). Only two smaller nations—Belgium and Switzerland—were found to be more productive. And in a comparison of international universities published last month by Times Higher Education in London, British universities—Cambridge, University College London, Imperial College London, and Oxford—occupied four of the top six places. (Other international league tables also rank British universities as second only to those of the United States, although concern about their methodologies led the European Commission to fund new rankings this year, which may produce different results.) “The RAE has allowed targeted investment in the best research and provided incentives to institutions,” says Lord Drayson, science minister in the UK government. “It has also been used as a benchmark of quality by universities. It's no surprise we now have four UK universities in the top six worldwide and our research is once again the most productive in the G8.” The 2008 RAE (http://www.rae.ac.uk) was, by any standard, an immense undertaking. It used 67 panels to sift through almost 2400 carefully prepared submissions from departments representing all disciplines in 159 British universities. The submissions included the four best publications from 52,500 research staff chosen to take part by their institutions. Between them, the panels subjectively rated every one of these items as world-leading, internationally excellent recognized internationally, recognized nationally, or unclassified. The panels then produced histograms summarizing the quality of each university department (Figure 2). This was a fresh approach to assessing research quality. Each time the RAE has been undertaken, its mechanisms have been adjusted—not just to better capture research quality, officials say, but to change the rules of the game before the universities learn to play it too well. In the 1996 and 2001 exercises, for example, university departments had each been given a single rating of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 5∗. This time, a more complex profile was generated for each department, and there was no official “league table” of performance in each discipline. In January 2009, HEFCE announced its funding formula, which converted these results into cash allocations. (The Scottish Funding Council and the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales later published their own, distinct funding formulae.) HEFCE had promised that the 2008 approach would support excellence “wherever it was found,” and the outcome was to find it more widely scattered than most observers had assumed. Whereas previous RAEs had strongly favored Britain's top research universities (especially the top 20; http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/), the 2008 RAE, unexpectedly, pointed to a greater dispersal of the available funds. “Successive RAEs have concentrated on research funding, and that has been incredibly successful for our country,” says Michael Arthur, vice-chancellor of the University of Leeds. “China, South Korea, Australia, France and Germany are all now trying to pull off the same trick. But the 2008 RAE reversed that trend. There was no recognition of critical mass. Funds are now spread significantly more thinly. Funding research excellence wherever it is found comes at a price.” In the end, cash allocations by the funding councils were adjusted to ensure that top institutions that might have lost out heavily from the bald results of RAE 2008—such as University College London—were protected. Even so, the results represented a kind of an impasse. As Jonathan Adams, the head of the Evidence consulting group, puts it: “It was a funding outcome that really irritated the top universities, without much helping those at the bottom.” Even as the 2008 results were sinking in, plans for the successor to the RAE were taking shape. In 2006, following a visit by university chiefs to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, the Treasury declared that this would be the last RAE. The replacement offering, the REF, was to be less onerous and cheaper—the 2008 RAE officially cost £60 million to conduct—and would make use of citation statistics, rather than peer review, to rank research excellence. Initially, HEFCE took these marching orders and began to design a REF, slated for completion in 2013, that would rely chiefly on citation data. It quickly conceded, however, that this was only feasible in science and engineering. But after pilot exercises this Spring exposed the weaknesses of the approach, such as inconsistencies in the data and the reluctance of researchers in several disciplines to accept that data as a reliable indicator of research quality, citations were sidelined. David Eastwood, the former HEFCE chief executive, now recalls the early development of the REF with something akin to horror. “I was at meetings in 2006 where we couldn't say ‘peer’ and ‘review’ in the same sentence,” he says. “We were very close to a very different outcome; we have traveled a long way since then.” But just as the universities succeeded in jettisoning the citations plan, a newer, and almost equally contentious approach came into view: the impact agenda. Again emanating from the Treasury, now under Chancellor Alistair Darling, the requirement to demonstrate “impact” beyond academia has, as the recession hits, rapidly emerged as the mainstay of government research policy. For the Treasury, officials say, “impact” equates simply to “economic impact.” But in presenting the impact agenda to the public, ministers have sought to include the impact on society as well. “The RAE has been a very useful tool, but I think it is time we improved on it,” says science minister Drayson. “Institutions will have to demonstrate how they have made a real impact on the outside world. In the past it has been enough to show that they have written high quality papers. I want to see researchers operate in a broader social context, not in an ivory tower.” In a 57-page consultation document published on September 23, HEFCE set out plans for the REF that reflect the impact agenda (http://www.hefce.ac.uk/pubs/hefce/2009/09_38/). In the 2013 exercise, it says, 60% of a university department's performance profile will depend on research quality, 25% on impact, and 15% on “research environment” (a measure of the quality of the overall research set-up in the laboratory or department). The main definition of research in the document has also changed, to cover “a process of investigation leading to new insights effectively shared,” with these last two words, officials say, laying further emphasis on “impact.” The proposed exercise would measure impact by asking panels of research users—such as business executives and government officials—as well as researchers, to review thousand-word “case studies” of how work done up to 15 years ago has benefited the economy and society. This idea has sparked a revolt among champions of curiosity-driven research, many of whom have signed petitions against the change. One of the petitions, organized by the University and College Union (https://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=4207), calls on the UK funding councils “to withdraw the current REF proposals” and create “a funding regime which supports and fosters basic research rather than discourages it.” By the end of October it had drawn more than four thousand signatures, including Nobel laureates such as Harry Kroto and this year's chemistry winner, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan. University officials are already concerned about the difficulty of assessing impact in a meaningful way. Thrift at Warwick derides the current impact proposal as “a call for people to send in nice essays.” Michael Arthur at Leeds called on HEFCE to show that such assessments are reproducible (in other words that two panels, faced with identical evidence, would come to similar conclusions) before implementing them. “If we're going to distribute £400 million a year on the basis of this, it is incumbent on us to show that we can reproduce it,” he says. But David Sweeney, head of research at HEFCE and the man chiefly responsible for the REF, says that such a demonstration is unnecessary: “We don't assess the reproducibility of our research output assessments,” he notes. Sweeney says that the results of the consultation on the proposal, which closes in December, will be swiftly taken into account and that “early next year” final details of the REF will be published. “Institutions want to get on with it, and they want to know the rules,” he says. “Our work now is to fine-tune the proposal. Its general structure is probably not up for discussion.” Bahram Bekhradnia, former head of policy at HEFCE and director of the Oxford-based Higher Education Policy Unit, which organized the Royal Society meeting, has welcomed HEFCE's current plan but voiced reservations about the size of the impact component. “We have important quibbles about impact,” he says, “but we can't agree with those who say that it should have no place in these proposals.” And many university chiefs believe that the proposal for the REF—which is now effectively a modified version of the RAE, rather than the sharply slimmed-down version that the government had in mind in 2006—will work satisfactorily. “I think people are getting too worked up about the impact proposal,” says Robert Allison, vice-chancellor of the University of Sussex. “It doesn't worry me at all. I think they've been sensible, allowing for the assessment of research that was done earlier on.” Edward Acton, vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia, adds that universities can ill-afford to come out in opposition to the impact agenda: “If the universities were to oppose it, that would come over as being so defensive.” Yet questions remain not just about the impact component but also about the overbearing role that the entire exercise has assumed in British academic life. As Thrift puts it: “The RAE/REF has, all protestations to the contrary, become not a means but an end.” He argues it has diverted UK university management from other goals, such as the need for more collaboration and for far more interdisciplinary work, and rendered them oblivious to the fresh challenges being posed by the deepening economic recession. Architects of the system concede that some of this is true but argue that much of the problem lies with how vice-chancellors and their administrative staffs have relentlessly used the figures generated by the RAE to tighten their grip on their institutions. Whenever an activity is terminated, a contract not renewed, or a department closed, managers tend to cite RAE results as the cause. Other criteria, such as teaching quality and the interaction between universities and the communities that they serve, are never quantified and therefore fail to compete effectively with RAE results for management attention. John Rogers, now director of research at the University of Stirling, managed the 2001 RAE at HEFCE and recalls his own surprise at the extent of this. “I thought at the time that the level of obsession at the universities was out of order,” he says. “I just found it astonishing.” Like other university research managers, Rogers is struck by how research excellence, quantified by the RAE, has driven out management emphasis on other facets of university life. “I don't think that the RAE is evil. It is what institutions do with it.” Dame Julia Higgins of Imperial College London, who chaired the chemistry panel for the 2008 RAE, concurs: “The vice-chancellors want to use it as a management tool; that's the problem.” David Willetts, Conservative Party spokesman on universities and research, has indicated that a Conservative government would focus its higher education policy on improving the quality of undergraduate teaching: a reflection, perhaps, of the keen sense, in middle-class Britain, that undergraduates aren't getting enough attention at world-beating British research universities. And despite the occasional floating of radical reform (such as the removal of HEFCE's role in the distribution of research funds, and their automatic allocation to universities in proportion to research council grant income), it is generally thought that the REF will survive a change of government next spring. The open question is whether the “impact agenda” will survive too. At a fringe meeting at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on October 5, Willetts disparaged the application of the “impact agenda” by the research councils. “We don't want to import that into the REF,” he says. However the impact agenda has powerful support, notably from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the country's most influential lobby group. “I think it is probably going to stay in there,” says Bekhradnia. British researchers, meanwhile, are already bracing for the arduous process of seeking a good result in the 2013 REF. David Finnegan, head of cell and molecular biology at the University of Edinburgh and chair of the Biological Sciences panel in the 2008 RAE, says that the process, while “demanding on the organizational structure of an institution,” need not distract bench scientists. “In the 2008 RAE, there was more evidence of it influencing institutional behavior, and recruitment, than ever before. But for individual researchers, I don't think it has such a big effect. My advice to them is—do good science and publish it, and you'll do all right.” However, as the senior members of each university department eye the REF proposals, there are already signs of behavior migrating to match its vociferous needs. At the University of Aberdeen, for example, which fared very well overall in the last RAE, the influence of the impact agenda is already making itself felt. “Some of the drug development work, that had been at an embryonic stage until now, has a little bit more impetus behind it, already,” says Colin McCaig, head of medical sciences at Aberdeen. But the impact agenda, he thinks, will cause less alarm among cell biologists than it will among, say, medieval historians. “There is a sense that it is just formalizing something that has been done before. The introduction and conclusion of our grant applications already has this stuff in it.” Of greater concern to McCaig and others may be the geography of the panels to which the university will submit its work. He thinks he made a mistake last time, for example, by electing to split his department's submission and put cell biology into a separate panel, for Pre-clinical and Human Biological Sciences. McCaig is convinced that the work submitted there was assessed more harshly, as things turned out, than it might have been in the more broad-ranging Biological Sciences panel. “I think we made a tactical mistake, which probably cost us quite a lot of money,” he says. That kind of calculation—how many researchers to include in the submission, what panels to submit to, what papers to put in, and how to convey impact in submissions—will feature prominently in the minds of department heads at British universities for the next 4 years. This imposition strikes some observers—especially those with experience abroad—as excessive. Additionally, the exercises have been accused of encouraging game playing, such as the submission of a small subsection of eligible researchers so as to elicit better scores, and of reinforcing gender discrimination. A September report for HEFCE (http://www.ecu.ac.uk/publications/files/equality-and-diversity-in-the-research-assessment-exercise-2008.pdf/view?searchterm=RAE) found that only 28% of eligible women researchers were included in submissions in 2008, compared with 45% of male researchers; the same disparity as in 2001. Yet the prevailing view remains that the RAE and its successor the REF provide necessary focus to a university system that, in the mid-1980s, was teetering on the brink of collapse. “For all of its faults, the RAE has had a very dynamic effect on the universities,” says Bekhradnia, “and it has strongly influenced behavior. Any new system will also have an impact on behavior, and we have to be very careful to make sure that it's a positive one, not a negative one.”"
