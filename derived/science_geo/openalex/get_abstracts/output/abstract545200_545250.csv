https://openalex.org/W2192556660,"Diverse repertoires of antigen-receptor genes that result from combinatorial splicing of coding segments by V(D)J recombination are hallmarks of vertebrate immunity. The (RAG1-RAG2)2 recombinase (RAG) recognizes recombination signal sequences (RSSs) containing a heptamer, a spacer of 12 or 23 base pairs, and a nonamer (12-RSS or 23-RSS) and introduces precise breaks at RSS-coding segment junctions. RAG forms synaptic complexes only with one 12-RSS and one 23-RSS, a dogma known as the 12/23 rule that governs the recombination fidelity. We report cryo-electron microscopy structures of synaptic RAG complexes at up to 3.4 Å resolution, which reveal a closed conformation with base flipping and base-specific recognition of RSSs. Distortion at RSS-coding segment junctions and base flipping in coding segments uncover the two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism. Induced asymmetry involving tilting of the nonamer-binding domain dimer of RAG1 upon binding of HMGB1-bent 12-RSS or 23-RSS underlies the molecular mechanism for the 12/23 rule."
https://openalex.org/W2131726621,"We performed untargeted metabolomics in plasma of B6 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) at the chronic phase of the disease in search of an altered metabolic pathway(s). Of 324 metabolites measured, 100 metabolites that mapped to various pathways (mainly lipids) linked to mitochondrial function, inflammation, and membrane stability were observed to be significantly altered between EAE and control (p < 0.05, false discovery rate <0.10). Bioinformatics analysis revealed six metabolic pathways being impacted and altered in EAE, including α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid metabolism (PUFA). The metabolites of PUFAs, including ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids, are commonly decreased in mouse models of multiple sclerosis (MS) and in patients with MS. Daily oral administration of resolvin D1, a downstream metabolite of ω-3, decreased disease progression by suppressing autoreactive T cells and inducing an M2 phenotype of monocytes/macrophages and resident brain microglial cells. This study provides a proof of principle for the application of metabolomics to identify an endogenous metabolite(s) possessing drug-like properties, which is assessed for therapy in preclinical mouse models of MS.

It is a classic example of chronic disease leading to physical, psychological, emotional, and financial burden for patients and their loved ones. Based on the disease course, MS can be classified into four categories, including relapsing-remitting MS, secondary-progressive MS, primary-progressive MS, and progressive-relapsing. Despite various therapeutic options for treatment, there is no cure for MS. Studies suggest that the most destructive changes from MS in the brain occur very early in the disease process and may cause considerable damage even before symptoms appear. MS treatments are more effective during the early course of the disease when symptoms are mild. Therefore, early diagnosis of MS is important to initiate treatments. However, no treatments have been able to delay progression of the disease, even though they improve the quality of a patient's life (1Miller J.R. The importance of early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.J. Manag. Care Pharm. 2004; 10: S4-S11PubMed Google Scholar) as a result of fewer exacerbations. Significant effort has been made to identify biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid to diagnose MS, and this endeavor has proven to be challenging without success (2Lourenço A.S. Baldeiras I. Grãos M. Duarte C.B. Proteomics-based technologies in the discovery of biomarkers for multiple sclerosis in the cerebrospinal fluid.Curr. Mol. Med. 2011; 11: 326-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The analysis of easily drawn bio-fluids, including blood for MS biomarkers, has only been minimally investigated but holds significant promise. The pathology of MS is associated with inflammatory response, glial activation, and scarring and demyelination that likely result in a systematic change in the circulatory metabolome. Thus, altered plasma metabolites may be a valuable approach as a surrogate for the disease. multiple sclerosis experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis resolvin D1 relapsing-remitting ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics eicosapentaenoic acid docosahexaenoic acid myeloid-derived suppressor cells myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein proteolipid protein T helper relative standard deviation. Recently, metabolic aberrations have been defined in various disease processes, as either contributing to the disease as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets (3Zhang A. Sun H. Yan G. Wang P. Wang X. Metabolomics for biomarker discovery: moving to the clinic.BioMed Res. Int. 2015; 2015: 354671PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolomics is the global exploration of endogenous small molecule metabolites of cellular processes in the biological system, including cell, tissue, organ, or organism (4Nicholson J.K. Lindon J.C. Systems biology: metabonomics.Nature. 2008; 455: 1054-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 5Zhang A.H. Sun H. Wang X.J. Recent advances in metabolomics in neurological disease, and future perspectives.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2013; 405: 8143-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, metabolic profiling can provide a window to the instantaneous physiological or pathological changes as a complement to transcriptomic and proteomic profiling for the systematic and functional study of living organisms (6Johnson C.H.

We have previously performed a comprehensive analysis of plasma metabolites in the RR preclinical mouse model of MS (SJL-experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE)) (14Mangalam A. Poisson L. Nemutlu E. Datta I. Denic A. Dzeja P. Rodriguez M. Rattan R. Giri S. Profile of circulatory metabolites in a relapsing-remitting animal model of multiple sclerosis using global metabolomics.J. Clin.

These metabolites were associated with alterations in lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, and xenobiotic metabolism (14Mangalam A. Poisson L. Nemutlu E. Datta I. Denic A. Dzeja P. Rodriguez M. Rattan R.

This study examined plasma from a chronic B6 mouse model of MS to determine the metabolic changes occurring in chronic EAE compared with the control B6 group. Bioinformatics analysis has revealed that metabolism of the PUFA pathway (ω-3 and ω-6 metabolism) is down-regulated in the plasma of EAE, which has also been reported in patients with MS (15Holman R.T.

We therefore examined the therapeutic potential of resolvin D1 (RvD1; 7S,8R,17S-trihydroxy-docosa-4Z,9E,11E,13Z,15E,19Z-hexaenoic acid) (20Serhan C.N. Hong S. Gronert K. Colgan S.P. Devchand P.R.

Female B6 and SJL mice (10–12 weeks old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in the pathogen-free animal facility of Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, according to the animal protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford Hospital. Murine myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG(35–55)) and proteolipid protein peptide (PLP(139–151)) were synthesized at New England Peptide, Inc. (Gardner, MA). Complete Freund's adjuvant and mycobacterium tuberculosis lyophilized powder were purchased from Difco. Labeled antibodies to anti-mouse CD4 (FITC; RM4-5), CD25 (PE; PC61), CD80 (Percp/cy5.5; 16-10A1), CD206 (APC; C068C2), and class II (I-Ab; FITC; KH74) for FACS analysis were purchased from BioLegend (San Diego). Anti-CD11b (PE-Cy7; M1/70), CD45 (eFluor 450; 30-F11), CD25 (APC-Cy7; PC61.5), IL17a (PerCp-Cy5.5; eBio17B7), IL4 (PE; 11B11), CD4 (APC; RM4–5), and FoxP3 (PE-Cy5; FJK-16s) were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego). Anti-Gr1 (APC-Cy7; RB6–8C5), CD86 (AF700; GL1), IFNγ (PE-CF594; XMG1.2), and class II (I-A/I-E; M5/114.15.2) were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-mouse scavenger receptor (PE; 214012) was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). ELISA kits for IFNγ, IL17a, IL6, IL23p19, and IL4 were purchased from BioLegend. RvD1 and its ELISA kit were purchased from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). The iScript complementary DNA synthesis kit and SYBR Green PCR master mix were purchased from Bio-Rad. B6 and SJL mice (10–12 weeks old) were immunized on day 0 by subcutaneous injections in the flank region with a total 200 μl of emulsion containing MOG(35–55) peptide (300 μg/mouse) or PLP(139–151) (100 μg/mouse), along with killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (400 μg) as described before (21Nath N. Khan M. Paintlia M.K. Singh I. Hoda M.N. Giri S. Metformin attenuated the autoimmune disease of the central nervous system in animal models of multiple sclerosis.J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 8005-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). B6 mice were given pertussis toxin (300 ng/mouse) in a volume of 200 μl in PBS intraperitoneally on days 0 and 2 post-immunization. Pertussis toxin was not injected in SJL mice. One set of mice was injected with complete Freund's adjuvant/pertussis toxin without peptide named as control. Clinical disease was monitored daily in a blinded fashion by measuring paralysis according to the following conventional grading system: 0, no disease; 1, complete loss of tail tonicity; 2, partial hind limb paralysis (uneven gate of hind limb); 3, complete hind limb paralysis; 4, complete hind and forelimb paralysis; and 5, moribund or dead. On day 45, blood was collected for plasma isolation for metabolomics. Cells isolated from lymph nodes (2 × 106/ml) of EAE and control mice were cultured in the presence or absence of peptide (20 μg/ml). Cell proliferation and the production of various cytokines (IFNγ and IL17a) were examined as described before (21Nath N. Khan M. Paintlia M.K. Singh I. Hoda M.N. Giri S. Metformin attenuated the autoimmune disease of the central nervous system in animal models of multiple sclerosis.J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 8005-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). On the same day, blood was drawn from both groups to isolate plasma for metabolomics analysis (in case of B6-EAE). For RvD1 treatment, RvD1 was given orally using a 22-gauge needle with a 1.25-mm ball diameter or intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 ng/mouse in the volume of 100 μl in PBS. In the control EAE group, 100 μl of PBS was given as vehicle. Following perfusion with Trump's fixative, spinal cords were processed for histology and pathology on day 45 post immunization as described before (14Mangalam A. Poisson L. Nemutlu E. Datta I.

Samples were stored at −80 °C until processed. Sample preparation was carried out as described previously (26Evans A.M. Bridgewater B.R. Liu Q. Mitchell M.W. Robinson R.J. Dai H. Stewart S.J. DeHaven C.D. Miller L.A. High resolution mass spectrometry improves data quantity and quality as compared to unit mass resolution mass spectrometry in high-throughput profiling metabolomics.Metabolomics. 2014; 4: 132Google Scholar) at Metabolon, Inc. Briefly, recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for quality control purposes. To remove protein, dissociated small molecules were bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2 min (Glen Mills Genogrinder 2000) followed by centrifugation. The resulting extract was divided into five fractions as follows: one for analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS; positive ionization), one for analysis by UPLC-MS/MS (negative ionization), one for the UPLC-MS/MS polar platform (negative ionization), one for analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and one sample was reserved for backup. Three types of controls were analyzed in concert with the experimental samples as follows: samples generated from a small portion of each experimental sample of interest served as technical replicate throughout the data set; extracted water samples served as process blanks; and a mixture of standards added to every analyzed sample allowed instrument performance monitoring. Instrument variability was determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the standards that were added to each sample prior to injection into the mass spectrometers (median RSDs were determined to be 4–5%, depending on the matrix tested; n ≥ 30 standards). Overall process variability was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites (i.e. non-instrument standards) present in 100% of the pooled human plasma or client matrix samples (median RSD = 6–12%, depending on the matrix tested; n = several hundred metabolites). Experimental samples and controls were randomized across the platform run. Non-targeted MS analysis was performed at Metabolon, Inc. Extracts were subjected to either GC-MS or UPLC-MS/MS (1Miller J.R. The importance of early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.J. Manag. Care Pharm. 2004; 10: S4-S11PubMed Google Scholar). The chromatography was standardized, and once the method was validated, no further changes were made. As part of Metabolon's general practice, all columns were purchased from a single manufacturer's lot at the outset of experiments. All solvents were similarly purchased in bulk from a single manufacturer's lot in sufficient quantity to complete all related experiments. For each sample, vacuum-dried samples were dissolved in injection solvent containing eight or more injection standards at fixed concentrations, depending on the platform. The internal standards were used both to ensure injection and chromatographic consistency. Instruments were tuned and calibrated for mass resolution and mass accuracy daily. The UPLC-MS/MS platform utilized a Waters Acquity UPLC with Waters UPLC BEH C18–2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7-μm columns and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and Orbitrap mass analyzer operated at 35,000 mass resolution. The sample extract was dried and then reconstituted in acidic or basic LC-compatible solvents, each of which contained eight or more injection standards at fixed concentrations to ensure injection and chromatographic consistency. The first aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion-optimized conditions, and the second aliquot was analyzed using basic negative ion-optimized conditions in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns (Waters UPLC BEH C18–2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm). Extracts reconstituted in acidic conditions were gradient-eluted using water and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, although the basic extracts, which also used water/methanol, contained 6.5 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The third aliquot was analyzed via negative ionization following elution from a HILIC column (Waters UPLC BEH amide 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7 μm) using a gradient consisting of water and acetonitrile with 10 mm ammonium formate. The MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS2 scans using dynamic exclusion, and the scan range was from 80 to 1000 m/z. The samples destined for analysis by GC-MS were dried under vacuum desiccation for a minimum of 18 h prior to being derivatized under dried nitrogen using bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide. Derivatized samples were separated on a 5% diphenyl, 95% dimethylpolysiloxane-fused silica column (20 m × 0.18 mm inner diameter; 0.18-μm film thickness) with helium as carrier gas and a temperature ramp from 60 to 340 °C in a 17.5-min period. All samples were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ fast-scanning single-quadrupole MS using electron impact ionization and operated at unit mass resolving power. The scan range was from 50 to 750 m/z. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of chemical standard entries that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as associated MS spectra and curated by visual inspection for quality control using software developed at Metabolon (23Evans A.M.

Cheminform. 2010; 2: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Identification of known chemical entities is based on comparison with metabolomic library entries of purified standards. Commercially available purified standard compounds have been acquired and registered into LIMS for distribution to the various UPLC-MS/MS platforms for determination of their detectable characteristics. Additional mass spectral entries have been created for biochemicals that have been identified by virtue of their recurrent nature (both chromatographic and mass spectral) and classical structural analysis but have not been confirmed with purified standards. Peaks were quantified using area-under-the-curve. Mouse plasma (100 μl) from control and EAE (B6 or SJL) was mixed with 9 volumes of sodium acetate (0.1 m, pH 5.0) and passed through solid-phase extraction (SeP-Pak; C-18 columns, Water). Samples were eluted with methanol and were dried under nitrogen. Samples were suspended in 500 μl of buffer (1 m phosphate solution containing 1% BSA, 4 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1% sodium azide), and 50 μl was used for ELISA as per the manufacturer's protocol (Cayman Chemicals). For staining surface markers, cells were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to CD4, CD11b, Gr1, CD206, scavenger receptor, CD45, CD25, FoxP3, CD80, CD86, and class II at the recommended dilution for antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. To analyze antigen-specific T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, spleen cells or CNS-infiltrating mononuclear cells were stimulated with 20 μg/ml of PLP(139–151) peptide for 18 h, followed by treatment with GolgiPlug for 5 h. Cells were surface-stained with monoclonal antibodies against CD4, then cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized with cytofix/cytoperm buffer, and intracellular cytokines were stained with antibodies against IFNγ and IL17A. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and results were analyzed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). SJL mice (8–10 weeks old) were immunized subcutaneously with 100 μg of PLP(139–151) per mouse in complete Freund's adjuvant. Post-10 days, we pressed spleen and lymph node cells through a 100-μm mesh into cold PBS to isolate them, and then cells were pelleted at 450 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Spleen/lymph node cells were resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer. Post-5 min incubation, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and counted with the hemocytometer using 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma). Spleen/lymph node cells were cultured in a 24-well plate (Corning Inc.) at 5 million cells/ml in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1.25% HEPES buffer, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 0.01% 2 mercaptoethanol (Sigma) for 72 h with PLP (20 μg/ml). PLP(139–151)-primed cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and counted using trypan blue to check cell viability, and 10 million cells were injected in a volume of 200 μl i.p. in each recipient SJL mouse. Mice received 200 ng of pertussis toxin at days 0 and 2 and were observed daily for disease onset and severity. CD4+ T cells were isolated from PLP(139–151)-immunized SJL mice using EasyStep mouse CD4+ve selection kit (92% pure) from Stemcell Technology (Vancouver, Canada). These cells (2 × 106/ml) were cocultured with adherent macrophages from RvD1-treated and untreated groups in a ratio of 1:5 and incubated for 72 h. Cell proliferation was examined using Wst1 reagent (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and cell supernatant was used for IFNγ and IL-17 analysis using an ELISA kit (BioLegend). Mouse brain microglial cells were cultured from 1- to 3-day-old pups, and microglia were isolated by shaking flasks of mixed glia at 100 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C. Suspended cells were 90% pure for macrophage/microglial cell-specific marker (Iba1). Primary microglial cells were treated with RvD1 (100 nm) or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) for 24 h, and cells were processed for the expression of arginase 1 and chitinase-3-like-3 (YM1)/2 by quantitative PCR, and data were normalized with ribosomal protein L27 (L27) housekeeping gene, whose expression did not change under any of the experimental conditions studied. For coculture study with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, treated and untreated microglial cells with RvD1 for 24 h were washed and cocultured with rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Post-24 h of coculture, cells were processed for expression of myelin genes, including myelin-associated glycoprotein, MOG, and myelin basic protein by quantitative PCR, and data were normalized to the control gene ribosomal L27 housekeeping gene. Metabolites with missing intensity scores, indicating low levels of the metabolite in the sample, were imputed with a small number (half of the minimum value for the study). Principal component analysis was used to detect outlying samples. Partial least squares discriminant analysis was used for assessment of separability of the samples. A z-score plot was drawn with the z-scores based on the mean and standard deviation of the control samples per metabolite. t tests, allowing unequal variance, were used to compare changes in mean expression per metabolite between the control and disease groups. An estimate of the false discovery rate (q-value) was calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons that occur in metabolomic studies. A metabolite was considered to be statistically different when p < 0.05 and q < 0.10. Those significant metabolites were included in a heat map using metabolite-level normalized data. Samples were clustered by complete linkage on Pearson's correlation, and rows are ordered by direction of change and then molecule type. Statistical analyses were conducted using log10-transformed data. Metaboanalyst was used to assess 82 murine-associated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways against differential metabolites and also for metabolite enrichment. Both over-representation analysis using the hypergeometric test and the impact of metabolite changes based on the pathway topology using the relative betweenness centrality measure (28Aittokallio T.

https://openalex.org/W2339017731,"In the last few decades a change in lifestyle has led to an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity and obesity-associated complications. Obese patients are at increased risk of developing hypertension, heart disease, insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes and renal disease. The excess calories are stored as triglycerides in adipose tissue, but also may accumulate ectopically in other organs, including the kidney, which contributes to the damage through a toxic process named lipotoxicity. Recently, the evidence suggests that renal lipid accumulation leads to glomerular damage and, more specifically, produces dysfunction in podocytes, key cells that compose and maintain the glomerular filtration barrier. Our aim was to analyze the early mechanisms underlying the development of renal disease associated with the process of lipotoxicity in podocytes. Our results show that treatment of podocytes with palmitic acid produced intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. This was accompanied by the development of inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress and insulin resistance. We found specific rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and slit diaphragm proteins (Nephrin, P-Cadherin, Vimentin) associated with this insulin resistance in palmitic-treated podocytes. We conclude that lipotoxicity accelerates glomerular disease through lipid accumulation and inflammation. Moreover, saturated fatty acids specifically promote insulin resistance by disturbing the cytoarchitecture of podocytes. These data suggest that renal lipid metabolism and cytoskeleton rearrangements may serve as a target for specific therapies aimed at slowing the progression of podocyte failure during metabolic syndrome."

Methods The population-based cross-sectional Beijing Eye Study 2011 included 3468 individuals. A detailed ophthalmic examination was carried out. Using fundus photographs, we measured the disc-fovea angle. Results Readable fundus photographs were available for 6043 eyes of 3052 (88.0%) individuals with a mean age of 63.6±9.3 years (range: 50–91 years) and a mean axial length of 23.2±1.0 mm (range: 18.96–28.87 mm). Mean disc-fovea angle was 7.76 ± 3.63° (median: 7.65°; range: -6.3° to 28.9°). The mean inter-eye difference was 4.01 ± 2.94° (median: 3.49°; range: 0.00–22.3°). In multivariate analysis, larger disc-fovea angle was associated (regression coefficient r2: 0.08) with older age (P = 0.009; standardized regression coefficient beta: 0.05), thinner RNFL in the nasal superior sector (P<0.001; beta: -0.17), superior sector (P<0.001; beta: -0.10) and temporal superior sector (P<0.001; beta: -0.11) and thicker RNFL in the inferior sector (P<001; beta: 0.13), nasal inferior sector (P<001; beta: 0.13) and nasal sector (P = 0.007; beta: 0.06), higher prevalence of retinal vein occlusion (P = 0.02; beta: 0.04), and with larger cylindrical refractive error (P = 0.04; beta: 0.04). Conclusions The optic disc-fovea angle markedly influences the regional distribution of the RNFL thickness pattern. The disc-fovea angle may routinely be taken into account in the morphological glaucoma diagnosis and in the assessment of structure-function relationship in optic nerve diseases. Future studies may address potential associations between a larger disc-fovea angle and retinal vein occlusions and between the disc-fovea angle and the neuroretinal rim shape."
https://openalex.org/W4210582335,"The majority of biosynthetic secretory proteins initiate their journey through the endomembrane system from specific subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum. At these locations, coated transport carriers are generated, with the Sar1 GTPase playing a critical role in membrane bending, recruitment of coat components, and nascent vesicle formation. How these events are appropriately coordinated remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Sar1 acts as the curvature-sensing component of the COPII coat complex and highlight the ability of Sar1 to bind more avidly to membranes of high curvature. Additionally, using an atomic force microscopy-based approach, we further show that the intrinsic GTPase activity of Sar1 is necessary for remodeling lipid bilayers. Consistent with this idea, Sar1-mediated membrane remodeling is dramatically accelerated in the presence of its guanine nucleotide-activating protein (GAP), Sec23-Sec24, and blocked upon addition of guanosine-5'-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate, a poorly hydrolysable analog of GTP. Our results also indicate that Sar1 GTPase activity is stimulated by membranes that exhibit elevated curvature, potentially enabling Sar1 membrane scission activity to be spatially restricted to highly bent membranes that are characteristic of a bud neck. Taken together, our data support a stepwise model in which the amino-terminal amphipathic helix of GTP-bound Sar1 stably penetrates the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, promoting local membrane deformation. As membrane bending increases, Sar1 membrane binding is elevated, ultimately culminating in GTP hydrolysis, which may destabilize the bilayer sufficiently to facilitate membrane fission."
https://openalex.org/W2142685451,"Recent studies have shown that despite crucially needing the creative talent of millennials (people born after 1980) organizations have been reluctant to hire young workers because of their supposed lack of diligence. We propose to help resolve this dilemma by studying the determinants of task performance and shirking behaviors of millennials in a laboratory work environment. We find that cognitive ability is a good predictor of task performance in line with previous literature. In contrast with previous research, personality traits do not consistently predict either task performance or shirking behaviors. Shirking behaviors, as measured by the time participants spent browsing the internet for non-work purposes (Cyberloafing), were only explained by the performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). This finding echoes recent research in cognitive psychology according to which conventional measures of cognitive ability only assess a narrow concept of rational thinking (the algorithmic mind) that fails to capture individuals' capacity to reflect and control their impulses. Our findings suggest that hiring diligent millennials relies on the use of novel cognitive measures such as CRT in lieu of standard personality and intelligence tests."
https://openalex.org/W2156180797,"Purpose We aimed to investigate mental health help-seeking intentions and preferences of rural Chinese adults and determine predictors of the intentions. Methods A total of 2052 representative rural residents aged 18–60 completed a cross-sectional survey by face-to-face interviews. The survey included seven questions asking about respondents’ help-seeking intentions and preferences, and a series of internationally validated instruments to assess self-perceived health status, depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, mental health literacy, and attitudes towards mental illness. Results Nearly 80% of respondents were willing to seek psychological help if needed, and 72.4% preferred to get help from medical organizations, yet only 12% knew of any hospitals or clinics providing such help. A multivariate analysis of help-seeking intention revealed that being female, having lower education, higher social health, higher mental health knowledge, and physical causal attribution for depression were positive predictors of help-seeking intention. Conclusion A huge gap exists between the relatively higher intention for help-seeking and significantly lower knowledge of helpful resources. Predictors of help-seeking intention for mental problems in the current study are consistent with previous studies. Interventions to increase help-seeking for mental problems by Chinese rural adults may be best served by focusing on increasing public awareness of help sources, as well as improving residents’ mental health literacy and social health, with special focus on males and those more educated."
https://openalex.org/W2221223651,"Calcium flux through store-operated calcium entry is a central regulator of intracellular calcium signaling. The two key components of the store-operated calcium release-activated calcium channel are the Ca2+-sensing protein stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and the channel pore-forming protein Orai1. During store-operated calcium entry activation, calcium depletion from the endoplasmic reticulum triggers a series of conformational changes in STIM1 that unmask a minimal Orai1-activating domain (CRAC activation region (CAD)). To gate Orai1 channels, the exposed STIM1-activating domain binds to two sites in Orai1, one in the N terminus and one in the C terminus. Whether the two sites operate as distinct binding domains or cooperate in CAD binding is unknown. In this study, we show that the N and C-terminal domains of Orai1 synergistically contribute to the interaction with STIM1 and couple STIM1 binding with channel gating and modulation of ion selectivity.

Whether the Orai1 NBD and CBD contribute to STIM1 binding independently or through a more complex manner is unknown. In this study, we determine the relative contribution of the Orai1 NBD and CBD to interaction with STIM1 by studying the effect of cycling mutations between the NBD and CBD on STIM1-Orai1 physical interaction and on channel gating. Our results reveal that STIM1 binding to the NBD and CBD of Orai1 occurs in a cooperative manner to control the gating and ion selectivity of CRAC channels. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM as described previously (21Palty R. Raveh A. Kaminsky I. Meller R. Reuveny E. SARAF inactivates the store operated calcium entry machinery to prevent excess calcium refilling.Cell. 2012; 149: 425-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Plasmid transfection of cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. For electrophysiological experiments, 6–8 h after plasmid transfection and 12–15 h before the start of experiments, cells were plated onto 18-mm coverglass coated with l-polylysine. For Ca2+ imaging, co-localization, and FRET experiments, cells were plated onto 18-mm coverglass coated with l-polylysine, and, 6–8 h after plasmid transfection, culture medium was replaced to wash off the transfection reagent. To avoid a constitutive calcium rise in cells expressing all forms of Orai1-SS or V102A mutants, cells were cultured in high-glucose, Ca2+-free DMEM supplemented with 50 μm La3+. Membrane currents were recorded under voltage clamp conditions using the whole-cell patch clamp configuration on an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass capillaries (5–8 MΩ). Signals were analog-filtered using a 2-kHz low-pass Bessel filter. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pCLAMP 10 software (Axon Instruments). Voltage protocols consisted of a 100-ms ramp from −100 to +100 mV delivered every 1 or 4 s from a holding potential of 0 mV. Current densities were calculated by normalizing currents measured at −90 mV to cell capacitance. The internal solution contained 150 mm cesium aspartate, 8 mm MgCl2, 8 mm BAPTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH). External Ringer's solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and either 10 mm CaCl or 10 mm MgCl2 was added to the external solution for high-Ca2+ or Ca-free solution, respectively. STIM1 activation was induced by passive store depletion, and currents measured from cells co-expressing STIM1 and Orai1 normally reached maximum within 2 min from cell break-in. Whole-cell recordings in cells co-expressing STIM1 with mutant Orai1 channels were therefore performed for a period of 4–10 min to ensure sufficient time for STIM-Orai1 activation. All data were leak-corrected using the current elicited in high Ca2+ Ringer's solution supplemented with 10–100 μm La3+ or in Ca2+ free Ringer's solution, as appropriate. For quantitation of relative expression of Orai1 constructs, we relied on fluorescence emitted by a tagged fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a quantitative reporter of cDNA expression (22Soboleski M.R. Oaks J. Halford W.P. Green fluorescent protein is a quantitative reporter of gene expression in individual eukaryotic cells.FASEB J. 2005; 19: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Images of cells expressing the indicated Orai1-SS constructs were collected with identical confocal settings. Images from untransfected cells (control) were used to assess background fluorescence values subsequently used to establish a threshold. All fluorescent pixels with more than five times the threshold value were recorded and normalized to the pixel area in the analyzed field. Transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated for 30 min with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies) in standard Ringer's solution (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 0.8 mm MgCl, 2.8 mm KCl, and 2 mm CaCl (pH 7.4)) and allowed to equilibrate for an additional 5–10 min without dye. Following dye loading, coverslips were mounted in a chamber, and emission (510-nm-long pass) images were collected during alternate excitation at 350 ± 5 nm and 380 ± 5 nm using a filter wheel (Lambda-10, Sutter Instruments). The imaging system consisted of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped with a ×20 objective and charge-coupled device camera (SenSys, Photometrics). Axon Imaging Workbench 4.0 (Axon Instruments) controlled both filters and collection of data. Cells co-expressing mCherry-Orai1 or various mCherry Orai1 mutants together with EGFP-S1C (an hSTIM1 fragment corresponding to residues 343–465) were plated and cultured as described above. Midplane sections of transfected cells were captured using an LSM 780 confocal microscope (Zeiss) controlled by Zen imaging software (Zeiss). EGFP was excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected from 493–540 nm, and mCherry was excited at 561 nm, and emission was collected from 583–685 nm. The parameters used for image acquisition were kept constant across all sets of experiments, and analysis was restricted to cells with similar EGFP and mCherry fluorescence to ensure similar ratios of S1C/Orai1 expression. Line scans of regions spanning the extracellular, plasma membrane and cytosol regions were analyzed from individual images using ImageJ. Each line had a total scan width of 36 pixels, corresponding to a length of 5 μm. The fluorescence intensity along each individual scan was normalized to the peak value. Finally, normalized line scans of both mCherry-Orai1 and EGFP-S1C from individual cells were aligned according to the peak maximum of mCherry-Orai1 to produce cellular intensity plots. Cells co-expressing mCherry-Orai1 or various mCherry-Orai1 mutants, together with EGFP-S1C, were plated and cultured as described above. Cells were fixed in 4% fresh paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed three times for 10 min with PBS. Cells were subsequently imaged in PBS on a LSM 780 confocal microscope (Zeiss). The donor (EGFP) was excited at 488 nm, and emission was collected from 493–524 nm, and the acceptor (mCherry) was excited at 561 nm, and emission was collected from 583–685 nm. EGFP-CAD donor fluorescence was imaged before and after bleaching a region of interest of mCherry-Orai1. Following bleaching, mCherry-Orai1 fluorescence was decreased to <10% of its initial intensity. FRET energy transfer (FRETefficiency) was calculated as % (FRETefficiency) = 100 × (Dpost − Dpre)/Dpost, where Dpre and Dpost are the donor (EGFP) intensities before and after acceptor (mCherry) bleaching, respectively. The STIM1-GFP construct has been described previously (21Palty R. Raveh A. Kaminsky I. Meller R. Reuveny E.

EGFP-S1C was created by insertion of the S1C fragment from mCherry-S1C into EGFP-C1 using BsrGI-BamHI sites. The mCherry-hOrai1 construct was obtained from the laboratory of Prof. Shmuel Muallem (National Institutes of Health). The Orai1-SS-EGFP and Orai1-S constructs were obtained from the laboratory of Prof. Tao Xu (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China). All point mutations were created by standard long-range PCR reaction, and all plasmids were sent to the DNA Sequencing Facility at University of California Berkeley for verification of the modified plasmid regions. Statistical significance of data was calculated using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) when comparing three or more dataset groups and unpaired two-tailed Student's t test when comparing two dataset groups (Microsoft Excel 2010). Predicted parameters for linear additive effects of double mutants were calculated by first scaling the measured parameters of each single mutant to the corresponding control. The resultant single mutation parameters were then multiplied pairwise to generate values for the relevant combinations of single mutations. To calculate the standard deviation of these predicted parameters, we employed standard propagation of error analysis using the standard deviation values derived from each single mutant dataset. The MSD (Mean, Size, Standard Deviation) format of the Student's t test analysis (SigmaPlot 11, Systat) was used to evaluate significance between measured and predicted parameters for double mutants. All data are reported as mean ± S.E.

Cell-based binding assays, however, showed that, although the NBD contributes to CAD-Orai1 interaction, it does not interact with CAD when key residues in the CBD are deleted (19McNally B.A. Somasundaram A. Jairaman A. Yamashita M. Prakriya M. The C- and N-terminal STIM1 binding sites on Orai1 are required for both trapping and gating CRAC channels.J. Physiol. 2013; 591: 2833-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This has been interpreted to indicate that the NBD-CAD interaction is of such low affinity that it cannot be detected. We wondered whether this observation could, instead, reflect a more complex interaction of CAD with the NBD and CBD in which it is more than a sum of NBD and CBD interactions. To investigate the functional interaction between the NBD and CBD, we introduced point mutations into the NBD, the CBD, or both and analyzed the effect on channel activation. Because several mutations in the Orai1 CBD abolish STIM1 binding, we forced a high local concentration of CAD near the channel by employing an earlier approach in which dimers of STIM1 C-terminal fragments (residues 340–485, S domain) are directly linked to Orai1 (Fig. 1A and Refs. 18Palty R.

Recent studies have suggested that pairs of Orai1 CBD from neighboring subunits interact in a conformation that is optimal for STIM1 binding. This raises the concern that the Orai1 CBD may be distorted simply by the covalent attachment of the STIM1 fragments. To verify that the Orai1-SS constructs represent a reliable framework to study the nature of interactions between STIM1 and Orai1, we asked whether tethering the STIM1 fragments to the Orai1 C terminus would prevent binding of untethered STIM1 fragments. Fig. 1 shows that tethering of the STIM1 fragment to the Orai1 C terminus does not prevent functional interaction between Orai1 and untethered STIM1 fragments. Despite its poor membrane expression, Orai1-SS R429C, which carries the loss-of-function mutation R429C in both of the tethered STIM1 fragments, is activated when co-expressed with a soluble STIM1 C-terminal fragment that is similar to CAD (S1C, residues 342–465 in hSTIM1; Fig. 1, C–E). Similarly, the Orai1 S channel, which displays submaximal channel activation when expressed alone, is maximally activated when co-expressed with the soluble S1C fragment (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the CBD of Orai1-SS retains the ability to bind to and be activated by STIM1. Having seen that STIM1 binding and activation are retained in the STIM1-tethered Orai1, we proceeded to ask how mutations in Orai1 that compromise activation by STIM1 interact in combination. We analyzed three mutants of Orai1 that are not activated by soluble STIM1 but retain activation by tethered STIM1, indicating that they weaken interaction with STIM1: K85E in the NBD and L276D and L273S in the CBD (data not shown and Refs. 18Palty R.

We reasoned that if each interaction contributed separately to STIM1 binding, then the effect of NBD/CBD double mutants would reflect the sum of the effects of the single mutations (Fig. 2B, dashed red columns) but that a cooperative process would result in a deviation from linearity. We found that even though the single mutants had normal or almost normal channel activation in Orai1-SS, as assessed either by the density of membrane current or by intracellular Ca2+ levels, channel activation was abolished in both double NBD-CBD mutants (K85E/L273S or K85E/L276D) (Figs. 2B). Expression profiles of the single and double mutants were comparable with that of WT channels (Fig. 2, C and D), and the conductance of the double mutant channels could be restored by the constitutively activating V102A mutation (Fig. 4), indicating that the effect of the mutations was on their ability to be activated by CAD and not on their expression levels or their ability to conduct large currents when the gate is constitutively open. These supralinear effects therefore suggest that the Orai1 NBD and CBD operate synergistically during channel activation by CAD.FIGURE 4.Cooperative interaction between STIM1 fragments and the N and C termini of Orai1 controls regulation of ion selectivity.

Physiol. 2008; 586: 5383-5401Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) have shown that NBD or CBD point or deletion mutations at positions Trp-76 or Leu-276, respectively, introduce mild to strong effects on channel activation and physical interaction between Orai1 and full-length unlinked STIM1. We therefore examined the effect of combining mutations in these positions on activation of Orai1 by STIM1 or by tethered STIM1 fragment (Orai1-S). We recorded similar current densities from cells that co-expressed STIM1 together with WT Orai1 or with the individual Orai1 mutants W76C or L276C (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, cells that expressed WT Orai1-S or Orai1-S carrying the W76C or L276C mutations displayed similar current densities. Although all WT and mutant Orai1 or Orai1-S displayed similar expression levels and plasma membrane localization (Figs. 3, C, D, G, and H, and 4A), a significant decrease in current density was measured for the double NBD/CBD mutant Orai1-S W76C/L276C or when STIM1 was co-expressed with the Orai1 W76C/L276C (Fig. 3, A and B). Therefore, non-linear interaction with the Orai1 NBD and CBD is not only a characteristic of activation by tethered CAD fragments but also of normal activation by full-length STIM1. Activation of Orai1 channels by STIM1 has been shown earlier to occur in a stepwise manner that involves a non-linear dependence on the number of STIM1s that bind to the channel (27Li Z. Liu L. Deng Y. Ji W. Du W. Xu P. Chen L. Xu T. Graded activation of CRAC channel by binding of different numbers of STIM1 to Orai1 subunits.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Hoover P.J. Lewis R.S. Stoichiometric requirements for trapping and gating of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2011; 108: 13299-13304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), leading to the proposal that Orai1 subunits operate cooperatively (30Hoover P.J. Lewis R.S. Stoichiometric requirements for trapping and gating of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2011; 108: 13299-13304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Having observed a non-linear interaction in channel activation by STIM1 or its C-terminal fragment S1C with the NBD and CBD of Orai1, we wondered whether cooperativity was restricted to the activation process. We therefore asked whether the regulation of ion selectivity in constitutively active channels follows the same rules. We analyzed the ion selectivity of V102A Orai1-SS mutants that contain the NBD point mutation K85E, the CBD point mutations L273S or L276D, or the double NBD/CBD mutations K85E/L273S or K85E/L276D by quantifying the reversal potentials of mutant channel currents in a calcium-containing solution. Reversal potentials recorded from cells expressing V102A Orai1-SS channels with wild-type NBD/CBD or with a single mutation in either the NBD (K85E) or CBD (L273S or L276D) were of similar values of about 40–50 mV (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, even when directly linked to CAD, the double NBD/CBD mutations (K85/L273S and K85/L276D) displayed non-selective currents with a reversal potential of 19.5 ± 4 mV for K85E/L273S and 6.2 ± 1.2 mV for K85E/L276D. These findings indicate that, as shown above for gating, the regulation of ion selectivity of constitutively active Orai1 channels by STIM1 also involves non-linear interaction with the NBD and CBD of Orai1. Having studied functional coupling between S1C and the Orai1 NBD and CBD, we turned to investigate their molecular association. We expressed WT Orai1 or Orai1 with mutations in either the NBD (W76C or K85E), TM4-CBD linker region (S263P), CBD (L276C), or with combination NBD/linker/CBD mutations (W76C/S263P, K85E/S263P, W76C/L276C, or K85E/L276C) and performed co-localization and FRET analyses. We found that two of the single mutants, W76C (NBD) and L276C (CBD), did not significantly change the interaction with S1C, whereas the K85E (NBD) mutation and S263P (TM4-CBD linker) moderately weakened this interaction (Fig. 5, A–C). Combining either NBD mutation W76C or K85E or CBD mutation L276C with the linker mutation S263P yielded an additive reduction in S1C-Orai1 association in each double mutant. In contrast, the double mutant Orai1 W76C/L276C, which combined an NBD mutant with a CBD mutant that individually had no significant effect, exhibited a substantially reduced S1C-Orai1 association (Fig. 5, A–C). Similarly, interaction was nullified in the Orai1 K85E/L276C double mutant (Fig. 5B-C). The results were also compared with the co-localization and FRET values predicted for the additive effects of these combined mutations (Fig. 5, B and C, dashed red columns). Therefore, just as we observed supralinear effects on gating and on regulation of ion selectivity of combining NBD and CBD mutations, as above, so too did combining NBD and CBD mutations have a supralinear effect on association with S1C. Our finding that STIM1-Orai1 protein association, channel activation, as well as modulation of ion selectivity are governed by cooperative interactions between STIM1 and the Orai1 N- and C-terminal regions sheds new light on important aspects of CRAC channel gating and permeation mechanisms. First, it implies that cooperativity in Orai1 channel activation by STIM1 begins in the binding step and is imparted to the subsequent gating and permeation processes. Second, it provides new evidence to support directs roles for both the Orai1 N- and C-terminal domains in channel gating. Importantly, they also suggest that CRAC channel activation involves simultaneous binding of STIM1 to both the Orai1 N- and C-terminal domains. Third, although alternative scenarios can be considered, as detailed below, taken together with earlier reports (1Park C.Y. Hoover P.J. Mullins F.M. Bachhawat P. Covington E.D. Raunser S. Walz T.

Green fluorescent protein is a quantitative reporter of gene expression in individual eukaryotic cells.FASEB J. 2005; 19: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the findings from this work support the idea that the Orai1 NBD and CBD assemble to form a distinct binding site for STIM1 and that STIM1 binding to this site controls channel gating and modulation of ion selectivity. A recent NMR structure of the STIM1 CC2 and the Orai1 CBD regions added structural insights on the interacting residues within the CAD-CBD complex (25Stathopulos P.B. Schindl R. Fahrner M. Zheng L.

Commun. 2013; (10.1038/ncomms3963)Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Notably, several of these residues have been shown to play important roles in channel activation. The exact regions in the Orai1 NBD and the corresponding residues in CAD that contribute to NBD-CAD interactions remain, however, poorly defined. Although our results suggest that CAD directly interacts with the Orai1 NBD through interactions with Trp-76 and Lys-85, we cannot rule out other interpretations. First, through allosteric coupling between the Orai1 NBD and CBD, a conformational change in the NBD, induced by the mutations employed in this work, may affect the affinity of the CBD for CAD, and second, the Orai1 NBD may indirectly contribute to communication with CAD through interactions with additional regulatory components, like calmodulin (31Mullins F.M.

They are characterized by a pseudocyclic backbone with two to four prolines and three disulfides arranged in a knotted motif. Similar to other knottins, cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors are highly resistant to degradation by heat and protease treatments. Thus far, only the α-amylase inhibition activity has been described for members of this family. Here, we show that cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors named alstotides discovered from the Alstonia scholaris plant of the Apocynaceae family display antiviral activity. The alstotides (As1–As4) were characterized by both proteomic and genomic methods. All four alsotides are novel, heat-stable and enzyme-stable and contain 30 residues. NMR determination of As1 and As4 structures reveals their conserved structural fold and the presence of one or more cis-proline bonds, characteristics shared by other cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors. Genomic analysis showed that they contain a three-domain precursor, an arrangement common to other knottins. We also showed that alstotides are antiviral and cell-permeable to inhibit the early phase of infectious bronchitis virus and Dengue infection, in addition to their ability to inhibit α-amylase. Taken together, our results expand membership of cystine knot α-amylase inhibitors in the Apocynaceae family and their bioactivity, functional promiscuity that could be exploited as leads in developing therapeutics."

Surprisingly, most of the genetic variants associated with plasma lipid levels fall within intronic sequences and putative 5′ and 3′ regulatory regions instead of the coding sequences. These observations raise the possibility that common genetic variants may influence plasma lipid traits through modulating the expression of nearby candidate genes as illustrated by the regulation of Sortilin 1 (Sort1) transcription by a noncoding polymorphism (27Musunuru K.

LDL receptor (LDLR) is required for the uptake and clearance of LDL cholesterol from circulation; its mutations cause familial hypercholesterolemia (20Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

LDLR expression is regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. The abundance of LDLR protein on plasma membrane is modulated by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which promotes endocytosis and subsequent degradation of LDLR (34Horton J.D.

In this study, we investigated circadian regulation of lipid-associated GWAS candidate genes in mouse liver. Our analyses identified two groups of genes exhibiting rhythmic and non-rhythmic expression patterns. We demonstrated that conditional ablation of the liver clock resulted in elevated plasma LDL/VLDL cholesterol due to a disruption of the PCSK9/LDLR pathway. At the mechanistic level, we revealed an unexpected mechanism through which the biological clock modulates cholesterol metabolism by targeting Trib1, a non-rhythmically expressed gene in the liver. A list of GWAS loci associated with plasma lipid traits was obtained from the Teslovich et al. (24Teslovich T.M. Musunuru K. Smith A.V. Edmondson A.C. Stylianou I.M. Koseki M. Pirruccello J.P.

A total of 27 candidate genes were included in our analysis with the exception of CETP, which is not present in the mouse genome.

Clustering analysis of the rhythmic and non-rhythmic genes was performed using Cluster 3.0 and visualized using TreeView software. All animal experiments were performed according to procedures approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals. Mice were fed ad lib and maintained in 12-h/12-h light-dark cycles. Bmal1 flox/flox mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (stock number 007668) and crossed with albumin-Cre transgenic mice (stock number 003574) to obtain the liver-specific Bmal1 knock-out mice. For in vivo adenoviral transduction, Bmal1 flox/flox and Bmal1 liver-specific knock-out (LKO) mice (three to five per group) were transduced with purified adenoviruses through tail vein injection (0.2 OD per mouse) as described previously (30Li S.

The titers of all adenoviruses were determined based on the expression of GFP and adenoviral gene AdE4 before use to ensure that similar doses were administered. Total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured using Cholesterol LiquidColor test kits (StanBio Laboratory) and a triglyceride assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. Lipoprotein profile analysis was performed using pooled plasma samples from two to three mice by the FPLC method. Plasma HDL and VLDL/LDL cholesterol concentrations were measured using an assay kit (Biovision). For the VLDL secretion assay, plasma samples were collected at different time points following intravenous injection of tyloxapol (500 mg/kg) and analyzed for total triglycerides. For the measurements of cholesterol biosynthesis rate, mice were injected with D2O containing 0.9% NaCl at a dose of 4.5% of estimated body water content for a period of 6 h starting at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 (6 a.m.) or ZT 12 (6 p.m.). Newly synthesized cholesterol was estimated by mass isotopomer distribution analysis. Plasma PCSK9 concentrations were measured using a Quantikine ELISA kit from R&D Systems. Total RNA was isolated from mouse livers and analyzed by quantitative PCR using the SYBR Green method as described previously (30Li S. Liu C. Li N. Hao T. Han T. Hill D.E. Vidal M. Lin J.D.

Data were normalized to the internal control 36B4. LDLR antibody was purchased from Abcam. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with vector or FLAG-PCSK9 plasmid with or without Trib1. Total cell lysates and conditioned media were collected for immunoblotting and ELISA analyses, respectively. Data were analyzed using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test for independent groups. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The biological clock orchestrates major aspects of nutrient and energy metabolism in mammals. Despite this, whether circadian timing cues impinge on the expression of genes associated with blood lipid traits and disease risk has not been explored.

https://openalex.org/W2112741960,"Inhibitors of Wnt signaling have been shown to be involved in prostate cancer (PC) metastasis; however the role of Sclerostin (Sost) has not yet been explored. Here we show that elevated Wnt signaling derived from Sost deficient osteoblasts promotes PC invasion, while rhSOST has an inhibitory effect. In contrast, rhDKK1 promotes PC elongation and filopodia formation, morphological changes characteristic of an invasive phenotype. Furthermore, rhDKK1 was found to activate canonical Wnt signaling in PC3 cells, suggesting that SOST and DKK1 have opposing roles on Wnt signaling in this context. Gene expression analysis of PC3 cells co-cultured with OBs exhibiting varying amounts of Wnt signaling identified CRIM1 as one of the transcripts upregulated under highly invasive conditions. We found CRIM1 overexpression to also promote cell-invasion. These findings suggest that bone-derived Wnt signaling may enhance PC tropism by promoting CRIM1 expression and facilitating cancer cell invasion and adhesion to bone. We concluded that SOST and DKK1 have opposing effects on PC3 cell invasion and that bone-derived Wnt signaling positively contributes to the invasive phenotypes of PC3 cells by activating CRIM1 expression and facilitating PC-OB physical interaction. As such, we investigated the effects of high concentrations of SOST in vivo. We found that PC3-cells overexpressing SOST injected via the tail vein in NSG mice did not readily metastasize, and those injected intrafemorally had significantly reduced osteolysis, suggesting that targeting the molecular bone environment may influence bone metastatic prognosis in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2133217810,"Cancer has become a major problem worldwide due to its increasing incidence and mortality rates. Both the 37kDa/67kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) and telomerase are overexpressed in cancer cells. LRP/LR enhances the invasiveness of cancer cells thereby promoting metastasis, supporting angiogenesis and hampering apoptosis. An essential component of telomerase, hTERT is overexpressed in 85-90% of most cancers. hTERT expression and increased telomerase activity are associated with tumor progression. As LRP/LR and hTERT both play a role in cancer progression, we investigated a possible correlation between LRP/LR and telomerase. LRP/LR and hTERT co-localized in the perinuclear compartment of tumorigenic breast cancer (MDA_MB231) cells and non-tumorigenic human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. FLAG® Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed an interaction between LRP/LR and hTERT. In addition, flow cytometry revealed that both cell lines displayed high cell surface and intracellular LRP/LR and hTERT levels. Knock-down of LRP/LR by RNAi technology significantly reduced telomerase activity. These results suggest for the first time a novel function of LRP/LR in contributing to telomerase activity. siRNAs targeting LRP/LR may act as a potential alternative therapeutic tool for cancer treatment by (i) blocking metastasis (ii) promoting angiogenesis (iii) inducing apoptosis and (iv) impeding telomerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2221693143,"TNF is central to inflammation and may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma. The 3′-untranslated region of the TNF transcript contains AU-rich elements (AREs) that are targeted by the RNA-binding protein, tristetraprolin (also known as zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36)), which is itself up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli, to promote mRNA degradation. Using primary human bronchial epithelial and pulmonary epithelial A549 cells, we confirm that interleukin-1β (IL1B) induces expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), ZFP36, and TNF. Whereas IL1B-induced DUSP1 is involved in feedback control of MAPK pathways, ZFP36 exerts negative (incoherent) feed-forward control of TNF mRNA and protein expression. DUSP1 silencing increased IL1B-induced ZFP36 expression at 2 h and profoundly repressed TNF mRNA at 6 h. This was partly due to increased TNF mRNA degradation, an effect that was reduced by ZFP36 silencing. This confirms a regulatory network, whereby DUSP1-dependent negative feedback control reduces feed-forward control by ZFP36. Conversely, whereas DUSP1 overexpression and inhibition of MAPKs prevented IL1B-induced expression of ZFP36, this was associated with increased TNF mRNA expression at 6 h, an effect that was predominantly due to elevated transcription. This points to MAPK-dependent feed-forward control of TNF involving ZFP36-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In terms of repression by dexamethasone, neither silencing of DUSP1, silencing of ZFP36, nor silencing of both together prevented the repression of IL1B-induced TNF expression, thereby demonstrating the need for further repressive mechanisms by anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids. In summary, these data illustrate why understanding the competing effects of feedback and feed-forward control is relevant to the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapies.Background:ZFP36 negatively regulates AU-rich element-containing mRNAs.Results:DUSP1 silencing increases ZFP36 expression and enhances negative feed-forward control of TNF.Conclusion:MAPK inhibition initially attenuates TNF mRNA, but reduced feed-forward control subsequently produces an increase.Significance:Understanding such networks is essential to develop novel anti-inflammatory therapies or understand TNF repression by glucocorticoids, which may not require DUSP1 or ZFP36 expression. TNF is central to inflammation and may play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma. The 3′-untranslated region of the TNF transcript contains AU-rich elements (AREs) that are targeted by the RNA-binding protein, tristetraprolin (also known as zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36)), which is itself up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli, to promote mRNA degradation. Using primary human bronchial epithelial and pulmonary epithelial A549 cells, we confirm that interleukin-1β (IL1B) induces expression of dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), ZFP36, and TNF. Whereas IL1B-induced DUSP1 is involved in feedback control of MAPK pathways, ZFP36 exerts negative (incoherent) feed-forward control of TNF mRNA and protein expression. DUSP1 silencing increased IL1B-induced ZFP36 expression at 2 h and profoundly repressed TNF mRNA at 6 h. This was partly due to increased TNF mRNA degradation, an effect that was reduced by ZFP36 silencing. This confirms a regulatory network, whereby DUSP1-dependent negative feedback control reduces feed-forward control by ZFP36. Conversely, whereas DUSP1 overexpression and inhibition of MAPKs prevented IL1B-induced expression of ZFP36, this was associated with increased TNF mRNA expression at 6 h, an effect that was predominantly due to elevated transcription. This points to MAPK-dependent feed-forward control of TNF involving ZFP36-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

In summary, these data illustrate why understanding the competing effects of feedback and feed-forward control is relevant to the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapies. ZFP36 negatively regulates AU-rich element-containing mRNAs. DUSP1 silencing increases ZFP36 expression and enhances negative feed-forward control of TNF. MAPK inhibition initially attenuates TNF mRNA, but reduced feed-forward control subsequently produces an increase."
https://openalex.org/W2151598800,"The impact of consuming biologically active compounds is often dose-dependent, where small quantities can be medicinal while larger doses are toxic. The consumption of plant secondary compounds can be toxic to herbivores in large doses, but can also improve survival in parasitized herbivores. In addition, recent studies have found that consuming nectar secondary compounds may decrease parasite loads in pollinators. However, the effect of compound dose on bee survival and parasite loads has not been assessed. To determine how secondary compound consumption affects survival and pathogen load in Bombus impatiens, we manipulated the presence of a common gut parasite, Crithidia bombi, and dietary concentration of anabasine, a nectar alkaloid produced by Nicotiana spp. using four concentrations naturally observed in floral nectar. We hypothesized that increased consumption of secondary compounds at concentrations found in nature would decrease survival of uninfected bees, but improve survival and ameliorate parasite loads in infected bees. We found medicinal effects of anabasine in infected bees; the high-anabasine diet decreased parasite loads and increased the probability of clearing the infection entirely. However, survival time was not affected by any level of anabasine concentration, or by interactive effects of anabasine concentration and infection. Crithidia infection reduced survival time by more than two days, but this effect was not significant. Our results support a medicinal role for anabasine at the highest concentration; moreover, we found no evidence for a survival-related cost of anabasine consumption across the concentration range found in nectar. Our results suggest that consuming anabasine at the higher levels of the natural range could reduce or clear pathogen loads without incurring costs for healthy bees."
https://openalex.org/W2230768852,"In support of the RNA world hypothesis, previous studies identified trimetaphosphate (Tmp) as a plausible energy source for RNA world organisms. In one of these studies, catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) that catalyze the triphosphorylation of RNA 5'-hydroxyl groups using Tmp were obtained by in vitro selection. One ribozyme (TPR1) was analyzed in more detail. TPR1 catalyzes the triphosphorylation reaction to a rate of 0.013 min-1 under selection conditions (50 mM Tmp, 100 mM MgCl2, 22°C). To identify a triphosphorylation ribozyme that catalyzes faster triphosphorylation, and possibly learn about its secondary structure TPR1 was subjected to a doped selection. The resulting ribozyme, TPR1e, contains seven mutations relative to TPR1, displays a previously unidentified duplex that constrains the ribozyme's structure, and reacts at a 24-fold faster rate than the parent ribozyme. Under optimal conditions (150 mM Tmp, 650 mM MgCl2, 40°C), the triphosphorylation rate of TRP1e reaches 6.8 min-1."
https://openalex.org/W2153213542,"We have demonstrated that the activation of apoptosis-like programmed cell death (AL-PCD) was a secondary result of caffeine (CF) induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC) in hydroxyurea-synchronized Vicia faba root meristem cells. Initiation of the apoptotic-like cell degradation pathway seemed to be the result of DNA damage generated by treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) [double-stranded breaks (DSBs) mostly] and co-treatment with HU/CF [single-stranded breaks (SSBs) mainly]. A single chromosome comet assay was successfully used to study different types of DNA damage (neutral variant-DSBs versus alkaline-DSBs or SSBs). The immunocytochemical detection of H2AXS139Ph and PARP-2 were used as markers for DSBs and SSBs, respectively. Acridine orange and ethidium bromide (AO/EB) were applied for quantitative immunofluorescence measurements of dead, dying and living cells. Apoptotic-type DNA fragmentation and positive TUNEL reaction finally proved that CF triggers AL-PCD in stressed V. faba root meristem cells. In addition, the results obtained under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) further revealed apoptotic-like features at the ultrastructural level of PCC-type cells: (i) extensive vacuolization; (ii) abnormal chromatin condensation, its marginalization and concomitant degradation; (iii) formation of autophagy-like vesicles (iv) protoplast shrinkage (v) fragmentation of cell nuclei and (vi) extensive degeneration of the cells. The results obtained have been discussed with respect to the vacuolar/autolytic type of plant-specific AL-PCD."
https://openalex.org/W2223289539,"Lianas (woody vines) are particularly abundant in tropical forests, and their abundance is increasing in the neotropics. Lianas can compete intensely with trees for above- and belowground resources, including water. As tropical forests experience longer and more intense dry seasons, competition for water is likely to intensify. However, we lack an understanding of how liana abundance affects soil moisture and hence competition with trees for water in tropical forests. To address this critical knowledge gap, we conducted a large-scale liana removal experiment in a seasonal tropical moist forest in central Panama. We monitored shallow and deep soil moisture over the course of three years to assess the effects of lianas in eight 0.64 ha removal plots and eight control plots. Liana removal caused short-term effects in surface soils. Surface soils (10 cm depth) in removal plots dried more slowly during dry periods and accumulated water more slowly after rainfall events. These effects disappeared within four months of the removal treatment. In deeper soils (40 cm depth), liana removal resulted in a multi-year trend towards 5-25% higher soil moisture during the dry seasons with the largest significant effects occurring in the dry season of the third year following treatment. Liana removal did not affect surface soil temperature. Multiple and mutually occurring mechanisms may be responsible for the effects of liana removal on soil moisture, including competition with trees, and altered microclimate, and soil structure. These results indicate that lianas influence hydrologic processes, which may affect tree community dynamics and forest carbon cycling."

It is different from the bacterial (ϵ) and mitochondrial (IF1) inhibitors. The N terminus of ζ blocks rotation of the γ subunit of the F1-ATPase of P. denitrificans (Zarco-Zavala, M., Morales-Rios, E., Mendoza-Hernandez, G., Ramirez-Silva, L., Perez-Hernandez, G., and Garcia-Trejo, J. J. (2014) FASEB J. 24, 599-608) by a hitherto unknown quaternary structure that was first modeled here by structural homology and protein docking. The F1-ATPase and F1-ζ models of P. denitrificans were supported by cross-linking, limited proteolysis, mass spectrometry, and functional data. The final models show that ζ enters into F1-ATPase at the open catalytic αE/βE interface, and two partial γ rotations lock the N terminus of ζ in an inhibition-general core region, blocking further γ rotation, while the ζ globular domain anchors it to the closed αDP/βDP interface. Heterologous inhibition of the F1-ATPase of P. denitrificans by the mitochondrial IF1 supported both the modeled ζ binding site at the αDP/βDP/γ interface and the endosymbiotic α-proteobacterial origin of mitochondria. In summary, the ζ subunit blocks the intrinsic rotation of the nanomotor by inserting its N-terminal inhibitory domain at the same rotor/stator interface where the mitochondrial IF1 or the bacterial ϵ binds. The proposed pawl mechanism is coupled to the rotation of the central γ subunit working as a ratchet but with structural differences that make it a unique control mechanism of the nanomotor to favor the ATP synthase activity over the ATPase turnover in the α-proteobacteria."

Although melamine is not considered to be acutely toxic with a high LD50 in animals, food contaminated with melamine expose risks to the human health. Melamine has been reported to be responsible for the renal impairment in mammals, its toxicity on the reproductive system, however, has not been adequately assessed. In the present study, we examined the effect of melamine on the follicle development and ovary formation. The data showed that melamine increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and induced granulosa cell apoptosis as well as follicle atresia. To further analyze the mechanism by which melamine induces oxidative stress, the expression and activities of two key antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathi-one peroxidase (GPX) were analyzed, and the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) were compared between control and melamine-treated ovaries. The result revealed that melamine changed the expression and activities of SOD and GPX in the melamine-treated mice. Therefore, we demonstrate that melamine causes damage to the ovaries via oxidative stress pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2215325438,"Rapid resistance detection is necessary for the adaptive management of acaricide-resistant populations of Tetranychus urticae. Detection of phenotypic and genotypic resistance was conducted by employing residual contact vial bioassay (RCV) and quantitative sequencing (QS) methods, respectively. RCV was useful for detecting the acaricide resistance levels of T. urticae, particularly for on-site resistance detection; however, it was only applicable for rapid-acting acaricides (12 out of 19 tested acaricides). QS was effective for determining the frequencies of resistance alleles on a population basis, which corresponded to 12 nonsynonymous point mutations associated with target-site resistance to five types of acaricides [organophosphates (monocrotophos, pirimiphos-methyl, dimethoate and chlorpyrifos), pyrethroids (fenpropathrin and bifenthrin), abamectin, bifenazate and etoxazole]. Most field-collected mites exhibited high levels of multiple resistance, as determined by RCV and QS data, suggesting the seriousness of their current acaricide resistance status in rose cultivation areas in Korea. The correlation analyses revealed moderate to high levels of positive relationships between the resistance allele frequencies and the actual resistance levels in only five of the acaricides evaluated, which limits the general application of allele frequency as a direct indicator for estimating actual resistance levels. Nevertheless, the resistance allele frequency data alone allowed for the evaluation of the genetic resistance potential and background of test mite populations. The combined use of RCV and QS provides basic information on resistance levels, which is essential for choosing appropriate acaricides for the management of resistant T. urticae."

The cause of this association remains unknown. Mutations in disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) increase the risk of developing psychiatric disorders [logarithm (base 10) of odds = 7.1]. Here, we identified DISC1 as a major player controlling pancreatic β-cell proliferation and insulin secretion via regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). DISC1 expression was enriched in developing mouse and human pancreas and adult β- and ductal cells. Loss of DISC1 function, through siRNA-mediated depletion or expression of a dominant-negative truncation that models the chromosomal translocation of human DISC1 in schizophrenia, resulted in decreased β-cell proliferation (3 vs. 1%; P < 0.01), increased apoptosis (0.1 vs. 0.6%; P < 0.01), and glucose intolerance in transgenic mice. Insulin secretion was reduced (0.5 vs. 0.1 ng/ml; P < 0.05), and critical β-cell transcription factors Pdx1 and Nkx6.1 were significantly decreased. Impaired DISC1 allowed inappropriate activation of GSK3β in β cells, and antagonizing GSK3β (SB216763; IC50 = 34.3 nM) rescued the β-cell defects. These results uncover an unexpected role for DISC1 in normal β-cell physiology and suggest that DISC1 dysregulation contributes to T2D independently of its importance for cognition."

We performed race-specific multiple logistic regression analyses between SNPs imputed to 1000 genomes in relation to POP (grade 0 vs 1–3; grade 0 vs 2–3) adjusting for age at diagnosis, body mass index, parity, and genetic ancestry. There were 1274 controls and 1427 cases of any POP and 317 cases of moderate/severe POP. Although none of the analyses reached genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8), we noted variants in several loci that met p<10−6.

First-line treatment for drug-susceptible TB requires the administration of a combination of four drugs during a period of 6 months: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Lengthy treatment regimens, unpleasant side effects, and patient noncompliance have provided conditions for the generation of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant cases of TB (2Zumla A.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6119-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Several lines of experimental evidence strongly support the notion that Rv2466c is a thioredoxin-like reductase that transfers reducing equivalents from intracellular thiols to substrates. Initial velocities recorded at different TP053 concentrations in the presence of the reductant 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and catalytic amounts of Rv2466c were consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics (kcat = 0.0403 s−1; Km = 6.489 μm) indicating that Rv2466c catalyzes the reduction of TP053 by DTT. This conclusion was supported by the observation that Rv2466c in its oxidized state and in the absence of DTT was unable to metabolize TP053 (9Albesa-Jové D. Chiarelli L.R. Makarov V. Pasca M.R. Urresti S. Mori G. Salina E. Vocat A. Comino N. Mohorko E. Ryabova S. Pfieiffer B. Lopes Ribeiro A.L. Rodrigo-Unzueta A. Tersa M. Zanoni G. Buroni S. Altmann K.H. Hartkoorn R.C. Glockshuber R.

Biol. 2014; 9: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle of Rv2466c, in the presence of 1 mm DTT, is the reduction of TP053 by reduced Rv2466c, and not the reduction of oxidized Rv2466c by DTT. The experimental data support a model in which the oxidized form of Rv2466c accepts electrons from a thiol reductant (DTT in the in vitro experiments), whereas the reduced form of Rv2466c, directly or indirectly, transfers the electrons to TP053 (Fig. 1). In combination with structure-activity relationship studies, it is suggested that the nitro group is being reduced to generate toxic anion radicals and/or a variety of other highly reactive compounds including nitroso and hydroxylamine derivatives (9Albesa-Jové D.

The crystal structure of reduced Rv2466c has been solved recently, revealing a unique homodimer in which a β-strand is swapped between the thioredoxin domains of each subunit, and an α-helical subdomain inserted into each thioredoxin domain (9Albesa-Jové D.

A large, mostly hydrophobic groove harbors a redox active-site motif CPWC, typical of the thioredoxin superfamily of oxidoreductases (13Holmgren A.

Using a combination of x-ray crystallography, small angle x-ray scattering, limited proteolysis, circular dichroism, site-directed mutagenesis and activity measurements, we show that Rv2466c undergoes significant conformational changes upon formation of its oxidized state, providing unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanism of TP053 activation. Recombinant Rv2466c wild-type and mutants were produced in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity as previously described (9Albesa-Jové D. Chiarelli L.R. Makarov V. Pasca M.R.

Rv2466c-C19S, Rv2466c-C22S, and Rv2466c-H99A, mutants were synthetized by GenScript using the pET29a-Rv2466c construct as template. Activity measurements were performed as previously described (9Albesa-Jové D. Chiarelli L.R. Makarov V. Pasca M.R. Urresti S. Mori G. Salina E. Vocat A. Comino N. Mohorko E. Ryabova S. Pfieiffer B.

Rv2466c mediates the activation of TP053 to kill replicating and non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis.ACS Chem. Biol. 2014; 9: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Rv2466c gene was amplified by standard PCR using oligonucleotide primers Rv2466c_CT_His_NdeI_TEV_Fwd (5′-GGAATTCCATATGCTCGAGAAGGCCCCCCAGAAGTCTGTCGCCG-3′) and Rv2466c_CT_His_HindIII_TEV_Rev (5′-CCCAAGCTTGTCGAACTGAGGCGGCTCGGTGCG-3′), Phusion DNAPolymerase (New England Biolabs), and genomic DNA from M. tuberculosis H37Rv as DNA template. The PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated to the expression vector pET23b (Novagen) generating pET23b-Rv2466c-CT-His. The recombinant Rv2466c-CT-His (220 residues) has an additional peptide of 13 amino acids (KLAAALEHHHHHH) at the C terminus that includes a histidine tag (Fig. 3). E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with pET23b-Rv2466c-CT-His were grown in 3000 ml of 2× YT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml of carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml of chloramphenicol at 37 °C. When the culture reached an A600 value of 0.8, the Rv2466c-CT-His expression was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (MIP). After ∼16 h at 18 °C, cells were harvested and resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm imidazol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl (solution A), containing protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche). Cells were disrupted by sonication (five cycles of 1 min) and the suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatant was applied to a HisTrap chelating column (1 ml, GE HealthCare) equilibrated with solution A. The column was washed with solution A until no absorbance at 280 nm was detected. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 20–500 mm imidazole in 40 ml of solution A at 1 ml/min. Fractions containing Rv2466c-CT-His were pooled and loaded into a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE HealthCare) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (solution B). Aliquots of 12 μl were mixed with 3 μl of 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 500 mm DTT, and 0.01% bromphenol blue at the indicated times. Samples were boiled for 3 min and run onto a NuPAGE® 4–12% gel (Invitrogen). Protein bands were visualized by staining the gel with SimplyBlueTM SafeStain (Invitrogen). The resulting preparation displayed a single protein band. Purified Rv2466c-CT-His was concentrated to 10–50 mg ml−1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C. Rv2466c-CT-His was crystallized in the presence of the 13-residue long C-terminal tag containing 6 histidine residues (Fig. 3). Two crystal structures were obtained, referred thereafter as Rv2466c-HT1 and Rv2466c-HT2. Rv2466c-HT1 was obtained by mixing 0.25 μl of Rv2466c-CT-His at 10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.25 μl of a solution containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 25% (w/v) PEG MME 2,000. Crystals grew in 7–8 days as rhomboid prisms to maximum dimensions of 140 × 80 × 80 μm and cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen using 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 10% (w/v) PEG MME 2,000, and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline ID29 (European Sychrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) and processed with XDS program (17Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11232) Google Scholar) to a maximum resolution of 1.70 Å. Rv2466c-HT1 crystallized in space group P21 with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). The second structure, Rv2466c-HT2, was obtained by mixing 0.25 μl of Rv2466c at 10.0 mg/ml with 0.25 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 m magnesium chloride, and 17% (w/v) PEG 20,000. Crystals grew in 1–2 days as rhomboid prisms to maximum dimensions of 100 × 50 × 50 μm. Prior to data collection the crystals were cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen by using 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 m magnesium chloride, and 10% (w/v) PEG 20,000 and 20% ethylene glycol as cryo-protectant solution. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline I04 (Diamond Light Source, United Kingdom) and processed with XDS program (17Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Oxidation of Rv2466c was accomplished with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma) in 100 mm NaH2PO4-NaOH, pH 8.0. To prepare oxidized Rv2466c (Rv2466cOX), 0.5 mg of protein at 1 mg/ml was mixed with 5 times molar excess of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) followed by purification with illustra NAP-5 columns (GE Healthcare). To test whether Rv2466c was fully oxidized, we repeated the incubation of Rv2466cOX with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). We could no longer detect the release of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid via an absorbance increase at 412 nm, confirming the absence of free thiol groups. Recombinant purified Rv2466cRED (25 μg) was incubated with 0.25 μg of trypsin (Sigma) in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence of 1 mm DTT and 1 mm CaCl2 for 0–90 min at 37 °C. 12-μl aliquots were mixed with 6 μl of 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 500 mm DTT, and 0.01% bromphenol blue at the indicated times. Samples were boiled for 3 min and run in a NuPAGE®12% gel (Invitrogen). Protein bands were visualized by staining the gel with SimplyBlueTM SafeStain (Invitrogen). The proteolysis of recombinant Rv2466cOX was essentially performed following the same protocol as for Rv2466cRED but using 0.05 μg of trypsin, and in the absence of DTT. The proteolysis of Rv2466cRED in the presence of TP053 (110 μm) was carried out by using 0.05 μg of trypsin, and in the absence of DTT. Samples were run in a NuPAGE®12% gel (Invitrogen). The gel was washed for 10 min with Milli-Q-purified water twice and then with NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen) during 15 min at room temperature. Proteolytic fragments were electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane using the iBlot dry blotting system (Invitrogen) during 7 min. The PVDF membrane was washed for 5 min with Milli-Q-purified water three times and bands were then stained with a solution containing 0.1 g/liter of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 40% methanol, and 1% glacial acetic acid. N-terminal sequence analysis was performed using an Applied Biosystems 494 procise cLC protein sequencer, in the Functional Genomics Center Zurich at the ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Far- and near-UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-715 CD spectropolarimeter at protein concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml (Far-UV CD spectra) and 0.2 mg/ml (Near-UV CD spectra) in 5 mm NaH2PO4-NaOH, pH 7.0, at 20 °C. Spectra of the reduced proteins were recorded in the same buffer containing 1 mm DTT. Thermal unfolding transitions were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a computer controlled water bath. Thermal unfolding was recorded at 222 nm in 5 mm NaH2PO4-NaOH at pH 7.0 between 20 and 90 °C with a heating rate of 1 °C/min. Transitions were tentatively fitted according to Equation 1 to obtain the apparent melting temperature (Tm; 25Sotomayor-Pérez A.C. Subrini O. Hessel A. Ladant D. Chenal A.

Curve fitting was performed with Prism GraphPad. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction data for recombinant purified WT Rv2466c and mutants were collected on the P12 beamline of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (storage ring Petra-3, DESY, Hamburg) on a pixel Pilatus 2M detector. Scattering patterns were measured with a 1-s exposure time for protein samples at a minimum of three different protein concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg/ml. Samples were incubated with 2 mm DTT or 2 mm ascorbic acid in the case of WT Rv2466cOX before data collection. To check for radiation damage, 20 50-ms exposures were compared; no radiation damage was observed. Using the sample-to-detector distance of 3.1 m, the range of momentum transfer values is 0.008 < s < 0.47 Å−1 (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ = 1.5 Å is the x-ray wavelength). Data were processed using standard procedures and extrapolated to infinite dilution by the program package PRIMUS (26Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I.

https://openalex.org/W2134154388,"The eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) states have differential effects on BOLD-fMRI signal dynamics, affecting both the BOLD oscillation frequency of a single voxel and the regional homogeneity (ReHo) of several neighboring voxels. To explore how the two resting-states modulate the local synchrony through different frequency bands, we decomposed the time series of each voxel into several components that fell into distinct frequency bands. The ReHo in each of the bands was calculated and compared between the EO and EC conditions. The cross-voxel correlations between the mean frequency and the overall ReHo of each voxel’s original BOLD series in different brain areas were also calculated and compared between the two states. Compared with the EC state, ReHo decreased with EO in a wide frequency band of 0.01–0.25 Hz in the bilateral thalamus, sensorimotor network, and superior temporal gyrus, while ReHo increased significantly in the band of 0–0.01 Hz in the primary visual cortex, and in a higher frequency band of 0.02–0.1 Hz in the higher order visual areas. The cross-voxel correlations between the frequency and overall ReHo were negative in all the brain areas but varied from region to region. These correlations were stronger with EO in the visual network and the default mode network. Our results suggested that different frequency bands of ReHo showed different sensitivity to the modulation of EO-EC states. The better spatial consistency between the frequency and overall ReHo maps indicated that the brain might adopt a stricter frequency-dependent configuration with EO than with EC."
https://openalex.org/W2149766241,"Diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) remains a challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of T-SPOT.TB test on cerebrospinal fluid mononuclear cells (CSFMCs) for suspected TBM patients. 43 consecutive patients with suspected TBM were enrolled in the study from June 2011 to September 2014. T-SPOT.TB was performed on both CSFMCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The final diagnosis of TBM was independent of the T-SPOT.TB result. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, predictive value, and likelihood ratio of T-SPOT.TB on CSFMCs and PBMCs were analyzed. Of the 43 patients, 12 (27.9%) were finally diagnosed with TBM, 28 (65.1%) with non-TBM, and 3 (7.0%) with indeterminate diagnoses. Of 40 cases with definite diagnoses, the sensitivity and specificity were 92.0% and 96.0% for T-SPOT.TB on CSFMCs, and 83.0% and 82.0% for T-SPOT.TB on PBMCs, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of T-SPOT.TB on CSFMCs were 85.0% and 96.0%, respectively. The PPV and NPV were 67.0% and 92.0% for T-SPOT.TB on PBMCs. The difference of T-SPOT.TB between CSFMCs and PBMCs was not significant so far as sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were concerned (P>0.05 for each). However, T-SPOT.TB on CSFMC andPBMC in TBM cases seemed higher than that in non-TBM cases. Our study further showed that T-SPOT.TB on CSFMCs might be a rapid and accurate diagnostic test for TBM.PBMC T-SPOT.TB ratio might be useful for the early diagnosis of TBM."
https://openalex.org/W2228129041,"Most bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAP) contain five conserved subunits, viz. 2α, β, β', and ω. However, in many Gram-positive bacteria, especially in fermicutes, RNAP is associated with an additional factor, called δ. For over three decades since its identification, it had been thought that δ functioned as a subunit of RNAP to enhance the level of transcripts by recycling RNAP. In support of the previous observations, we also find that δ is involved in recycling of RNAP by releasing the RNA from the ternary complex. We further show that δ binds to RNA and is able to recycle RNAP when the length of the nascent RNA reaches a critical length. However, in this work we decipher a new function of δ. Performing biochemical and mutational analysis, we show that Bacillus subtilis δ binds to DNA immediately upstream of the promoter element at A-rich sequences on the abrB and rrnB1 promoters and facilitates open complex formation. As a result, δ facilitates RNAP to initiate transcription in the second scale, compared with minute scale in the absence of δ. Using transcription assay, we show that δ-mediated recycling of RNAP cannot be the sole reason for the enhancement of transcript yield. Our observation that δ does not bind to RNAP holo enzyme but is required to bind to DNA upstream of the -35 promoter element for transcription activation suggests that δ functions as a transcriptional regulator."

Methods In a single center observational retrospective study, 3712 subjects were diagnosed with lung cancer from 2003 to 2013 (EBUS was introduced in 2008). Thus, we divided the data into two periods: the conventional bronchoscopy period (2003 to 2007) and the EBUS period (2008 to 2013). Results A total of 3712 patients were included in the analysis. Comparing the conventional bronchoscopy period with the EBUS period data, there has been a significant reduction in the use of diagnostic modalities: CT-guided biopsy (P < 0.0001) and pleural effusion cytology (P < 0.0001). The proportion of subjects diagnosed using bronchoscopy significantly increased from 39.4% in the conventional period to 47.4% in the EBUS period (P < 0.0001). In the EBUS period, there has also been a significant increase in the proportion of patients proceeding directly to diagnostic surgery (P < 0.0001). Compared to bronchoscopy, the incidence of complications was higher in those who underwent CT guide biopsy. The incidence of iatrogenic pneumothorax significantly decreased in the EBUS period. Conclusions Advanced bronchoscopic techniques are widely used in the diagnosis of lung cancer. At our institution, the increasing use of EBUS for providing lung cancer diagnosis has led to a significant reduction in other diagnostic modalities, namely CT-guided biopsy and pleural effusion cytology. These changes in practice also led to a reduction in the incidence of complications."
https://openalex.org/W2138635051,"What distinguishes a competent decision maker and how should the issue of decision quality be approached in a real-life context? These questions were explored in three studies. In Study 1, using a web-based questionnaire and targeting a community sample, we investigated the relationships between objective and subjective indicators of real-life decision-making success. In Study 2 and 3, targeting two different samples of professionals, we explored if the prevalent cognitively oriented definition of decision-making competence could be beneficially expanded by adding aspects of competence in terms of social skills and time-approach. The predictive power for each of these three aspects of decision-making competence was explored for different indicators of real-life decision-making success. Overall, our results suggest that research on decision-making competence would benefit by expanding the definition of competence, by including decision-related abilities in terms of social skills and time-approach. Finally, the results also indicate that individual differences in real-life decision-making success profitably can be approached and measured by different criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2209847851,"The Macrophage Receptor with COllagenous structure (MARCO) protein is a plasma membrane receptor for un-opsonized or environmental particles on phagocytic cells. Here, we show that MARCO was internalized either by ruffling of plasma membrane followed by macropinocytosis or by endocytosis followed by fusion with autophagosome in CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with GFP-MARCO. The macropinocytic process generated large vesicles when the plasma membrane subsided. The endocytosis/autophagosome (amphisome) generated small fluorescent puncta which were visible in the presence of glutamine, chloroquine, bafilomycin, ammonia, and other amines. The small puncta, but not the large vesicles, co-localized with LC3B and lysosomes. The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio increased in the presence of glutamine, ammonia, and chloroquine in various cells. The small puncta trafficked between the peri-nuclear region and the distal ends of cells back and forth at rates of up to 2–3 μm/sec; tubulin, but not actin, regulated the trafficking of the small puncta. Besides phagocytosis MARCO, an adhesive plasma membrane receptor, may play a role in incorporation of various extracellular materials into the cell via both macropinocytic and endocytic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2123736958,"The thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is member of the leucine-rich repeat subfamily (LGR). In the absence of crystal structure, the success of rational design of ligands targeting the receptor internal cavity depends on the quality of the TSHR models built. In this subfamily, transmembrane helices (TM) 2 and 5 are characterized by the absence of proline compared to most receptors, raising the question of the structural conformation of these helices. To gain insight into the structural properties of these helices, we carried out bioinformatics and experimental studies. Evolutionary analysis of the LGR family revealed a deletion in TM5 but provided no information on TM2. Wild type residues at positions 2.58, 2.59 or 2.60 in TM2 and/or at position 5.50 in TM5 were substituted to proline. Depending on the position of the proline substitution, different effects were observed on membrane expression, glycosylation, constitutive cAMP activity and responses to thyrotropin. Only proline substitution at position 2.59 maintained complex glycosylation and high membrane expression, supporting occurrence of a bulged TM2. The TSHR transmembrane domain was modeled by homology with the orexin 2 receptor, using a protocol that forced the deletion of one residue in the TM5 bulge of the template. The stability of the model was assessed by molecular dynamics simulations. TM5 straightened during the equilibration phase and was stable for the remainder of the simulations. Our data support a structural model of the TSHR transmembrane domain with a bulged TM2 and a straight TM5 that is specific of glycoprotein hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2125728554,"Obesity is an important medical problem affecting humans and animals in the developed world, but the evolutionary origins of the behaviours that cause obesity are poorly understood. The potential role of occasional gluts of food in determining fat-storage strategies for avoiding mortality have been overlooked, even though animals experienced such conditions in the recent evolutionary past and may follow the same strategies in the modern environment. Humans, domestic, and captive animals in the developed world are exposed to a surplus of calorie-rich food, conditions characterised as ‘constant-glut’. Here, we use a mathematical model to demonstrate that obesity-related mortality from poor health in a constant-glut environment should equal the average mortality rate in the ‘pre-modern’ environment when predation risk was more closely linked with foraging. It should therefore not be surprising that animals exposed to abundant food often over-eat to the point of ill-health. Our work suggests that individuals tend to defend a given excessive level of reserves because this level was adaptive when gluts were short-lived. The model predicts that mortality rate in constant-glut conditions can increase as the assumed health cost of being overweight decreases, meaning that any adaptation that reduced such health costs would have counter-intuitively led to an increase in mortality in the modern environment. Taken together, these results imply that efforts to reduce the incidence of obesity that are focussed on altering individual behaviour are likely to be ineffective because modern, constant-glut conditions trigger previously adaptive behavioural responses."
https://openalex.org/W2160807111,"Objective This study aimed to describe the ways social support works in the daily life of patients with type 2 diabetes living in conditions of social and economic marginality, in order to understand how that support relates to treatment compliance. Methods Sequential mixed methods research was used. The sample of patients was obtained from primary health care units and selected considering regional representativeness, and levels of morbidity and mortality for type 2 diabetes. Results Results point to the nuclear family as the main source of support. Regardless of the area of residence, four main dimensions of support were identified: economic support, help with treatment compliance, emotional support, and material aid. Conclusions We conclude that the support network assists the patient in different ways and helps cope with the disease, but in conditions of social and economic marginality, does not guarantee the quality of attention nor enable the self-management of treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2168715814,"Managing stairs is a challenging aspect of daily activities of living for older people. We assessed whether older adults with visual impairment (VI) have greater difficulties of managing stairs in daily lives.The study was designed as a community-based cross-sectional study based on a Chinese cohort aged 60 years and older in rural China. Visual acuity (VA) was measured in both eyes using a retro-illuminated Snellen chart with tumbling-E optotypes. VI (including blindness) was defined as presenting VA of worse than 20/60 in either eye. Having any difficulties in managing stairs was self-reported based on a question drawn from the Barthel Index. Information on participants' socioeconomic status, lifestyle-related factors, diseases histories and medication intake was collected using a questionnaire.The Barthel Index, Activities of Daily Living questionnaire was completed by 4597 (99.7%) participants including 2218 men and 2379 women. The age of the participants ranged from 60 to 93 years with a mean of 67.6 ± 6.3 years. In age and gender adjusted models, adults with VI had a higher likelihood of having difficulties in managing stairs (odds ratio [OR] = 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0, 3.7) compared with those without. The association of VI with the likelihood of having difficulties in managing stairs was stronger in older adults who lived alone (OR = 3.2; 95%CI 1.8, 4.5) compared with those who lived with other family members (OR = 2.0; 95%CI 1.3, 4.3). Compared with hypertension, diabetes, obesity and cognitive dysfunction, VI had the greatest impact on people's abilities of managing stairs.VI was associated with an increased likelihood of having difficulties in managing stairs, especially in those who lived alone. However, whether the finding could be extrapolated to other populations warrants further studies as different environmental exposures such as illumination and types of stairs may alter the association observed in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2106226987,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maintained within nucleoprotein complexes known as nucleoids. These structures are highly condensed by the DNA packaging protein, mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM). Nucleoids also include RNA, RNA:DNA hybrids, and are associated with proteins involved with RNA processing and mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. Here we characterize the ability of TFAM to bind various RNA containing substrates in order to determine their role in TFAM distribution and function within the nucleoid. We find that TFAM binds to RNA-containing 4-way junctions but does not bind appreciably to RNA hairpins, internal loops, or linear RNA:DNA hybrids. Therefore the RNA within nucleoids largely excludes TFAM, and its distribution is not grossly altered with removal of RNA. Within the cell, TFAM binds to mitochondrial tRNAs, consistent with our RNA 4-way junction data. Kinetic binding assays and RNase-insensitive TFAM distribution indicate that DNA remains the preferred substrate within the nucleoid. However, TFAM binds to tRNA with nanomolar affinity and these complexes are not rare. TFAM-immunoprecipitated tRNAs have processed ends, suggesting that binding is not specific to RNA precursors. The amount of each immunoprecipitated tRNA is not well correlated with tRNA celluar abundance, indicating unequal TFAM binding preferences. TFAM-mt-tRNA interaction suggests potentially new functions for this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2129475272,"Background Associations between carotid artery longitudinal displacement, cardiovascular disease risk factors, and events were evaluated in a large, multi-ethnic cohort. Materials and Methods A novel, reproducible protocol was developed for measuring right common carotid artery longitudinal displacement using ultrasound speckle-tracking. Total longitudinal displacement was measured in 389 randomly selected participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis that were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Univariate analyses and Pearson Correlations were used to define relationships between longitudinal displacement with traditional cardiovascular risk factors and traditional measures of arterial stiffness. Hazard ratios of longitudinal displacement for cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease events were compared using Cox proportional hazards models. Results Participants were a mean (standard deviation) 59.0 (8.7) years old, 48% female, 39% White, 26% Black, 22% Hispanic, and 14% Chinese. They had 19 (4.9%) cardiovascular disease and 14 (3.6%) coronary heart disease events over a mean 9.5 years of follow-up. Less longitudinal displacement was associated with Chinese (β = -0.11, p = 0.02) compared to White race/ethnicity and greater longitudinal displacement was associated with higher carotid intima-media thickness (β = 0.26, p = 0.004). Longitudinal displacement was not associated with other cardiovascular disease risk factors or markers of arterial stiffness. After adjustment for age and sex, and heart rate, Chinese race/ethnicity (β = -0.10, p = 0.04) and carotid intima-media thickness (β = 0.30 p = 0.003) were associated independently with longitudinal displacement. Longitudinal displacement predicted coronary heart disease (Hazard ratio [HR] 3.3, 95% Confidence intervals [CI] 0.96–11.14, p = 0.06) and cardiovascular disease (HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.6–7.3, p = 0.23) events. Conclusions Less longitudinal displacement is associated with Chinese ethnicity and greater carotid artery longitudinal displacement is associated with thicker intima-media thickness. Longitudinal displacement may predict adverse coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events."

https://openalex.org/W2199301547,"In vitro neuronal cultures have become a popular method with which to probe network-level neuronal dynamics and phenomena in controlled laboratory settings. One of the key dynamics of interest in these in vitro studies has been the extent to which cultured networks display properties indicative of learning. Here we demonstrate the effects of a high frequency electrical stimulation signal in training cultured networks of cortical neurons. Networks receiving this training signal displayed a time-dependent increase in the response to a low frequency probing stimulation, particularly in the time window of 20–50 ms after stimulation. This increase was found to be statistically significant as compared to control networks that did not receive training. The timing of this increase suggests potentiation of synaptic mechanisms. To further investigate this possibility, we leveraged the powerful Cox statistical connectivity method as previously investigated by our group. This method was used to identify and track changes in network connectivity strength."
https://openalex.org/W2235385530,"The dysregulation of miR-137 plays vital roles in the oncogenesis and progression of various types of cancer, but its role in prognosis of gastric cancer patients remains unknown. This study was designed to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of miR-137 in gastric cancer patients after radical gastrectomy. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the expression of miR-137 in human gastric cancer cell lines and tissues in patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. Results were assessed for association with clinical factors and overall survival by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Prognostic values of miR-137 expression and clinical outcomes were evaluated by Cox regression analysis. The results exhibited that the expression level of miR-137 was decreased in human gastric cancer cell lines and tissues, and down-regulated expression of miR-137 was associated with tumor cell differentiation, N stage, and TNM stage. Decreased miR-137 expression in gastric cancer tissues was positively correlated with poor overall survival of gastric cancer patients. Further multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that miR-137 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for gastric cancer except for TNM stage. Applying the prognostic value of miR-137 expression to TNM stage III group showed a better risk stratification for overall survival. In conclusion, the results reinforced the critical role for the down-regulated miR-137 expression in gastric cancer and suggested that miR-137 expression could be a prognostic indicator for this disease. In addition, these patients with TNM stage III gastric cancer and low miR-137 expression might need more aggressive postoperative treatment and closer follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2262906890,"To investigate the protective role of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling associated with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in a mouse model.Male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, LPS, LPS-cyclopamine group and cyclopamine group. ALI was induced by LPS ip injection (5 mg/kg). The sonic hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine (50 mg/kg) was given to the LPS-cyclopamine group at 30 min after LPS injection as well as normal mice as control. Lung injury was observed histologically in hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained tissue sections, semi-quantified by lung tissue injury score, and the lung tissue mass alteration was measured by wet to dry weight ratio (W/D). mRNA expression levels of TNF-α, SHH, Patched (PTC) and GLI1 in lung tissue were studied with real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR), while the protein expression of SHH and GLI1 was determined by western blot analysis.Lung tissue injury score, thickness of alveolar septa, W/D, and TNF-α mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in the ALI mice than the normal mice (P<0.05). The mRNA expression levels of SHH, PTC, and GLI1 in the ALI mice were significantly higher at 12h and 24h after LPS injection, but not at the 6h time point. Protein production of SHH and GLI1 at 6h, 12h, and 24h in the lungs of ALI mice significantly increased, in a time-dependent manner, compared with that in normal mice. Cyclopamine alone has no effect on pathological changes in normal mice. Intervention with cyclopamine in ALI mice led to a reduction in mRNA levels of SHH, PTC, and GLI1 as well as SHH and GLI1 protein levels; meanwhile, the pathological injury scores of lung tissues, thickness of alveolar septa, W/D, and mRNA expression levels of TNF-α increased compared with mice receiving LPS only.The SHH signaling pathway was activated in response to LPS-induced ALI, and up-regulation of SHH expression could alleviate lung injury and be involved in the repair of injured lung tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2142869937,"Introduction Vibration perception threshold (VPT) examination using a neurothesiometer provides objective, sensitive and specific information, and has been utilized mainly in patients with diabetic polyneropathy. Objectives Explore the utility of VPT examination in CIDP patients. Methods CIDP subjects attending the Neuromuscular clinic between 01/2013 and 12/2014 were evaluated. Demographic data, clinical history, physical examination, VPT values, and electrophysiologic data from their charts were extracted. Results 70 charts were reviewed. 55 CIDP patients had elevated VPT, associated with higher frequency of abnormal sensory testing for various modalities (92.7% vs. 46.7%, p<0.0001), lower sensory and motor amplitudes and reduced conduction velocities on nerve conduction studies, and lower treatment response rates (54% vs. 93%, p = 0.01). Conclusion VPT examination is a simple tool, which is a reliable and sensitive measure not only for diabetic neuropathy, but also for CIDP. Moreover, in CIDP, elevated VPT values are also associated with lower treatment response rates."

Following the arrival of a new digital detector in a radiology department, all the staff involved should adapt the procedure parameters to the properties of the detector, in order to achieve an optimal result in terms of correct diagnostic information and minimum radiation risks for the patient. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a software capable of simulating a digital X-ray imaging system, using graphics processing unit computing. All radiological image components were implemented in this application: an X-ray tube with primary beam, a virtual patient, noise, scatter radiation, a grid and a digital detector. Three different digital detectors (two digital radiography and a computed radiography systems) were implemented. In order to validate the software, we carried out a quantitative comparison of geometrical and anthropomorphic phantom simulated images with those acquired. In terms of average pixel values, the maximum differences were below 15%, while the noise values were in agreement with a maximum difference of 20%. The relative trends of contrast to noise ratio versus beam energy and intensity were well simulated. Total calculation times were below 3 seconds for clinical images with pixel size of actual dimensions less than 0.2 mm. The application proved to be efficient and realistic. Short calculation times and the accuracy of the results obtained make this software a useful tool for training operators and dose optimisation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2109477645,"The impermeability of the adult blood-brain barrier (BBB) to lysosomal enzymes impedes the ability to treat the central nervous system manifestations of lysosomal storage diseases. Here, we found that simultaneous stimulation of the alpha1 and alpha2 adrenoreceptor restores in adult mice the high rate of transport for the lysosomal enzyme P-GUS that is seen in neonates but lost with development. Beta adrenergics, other monoamines, and acetylcholine did not restore this transport. A high dose (500 microg/mouse) of clonidine, a strong alpha2 and weak alpha1 agonist, was able to act as monotherapy in the stimulation of P-GUS transport. Neither use of alpha1 plus alpha2 agonists nor the high dose clonidine disrupted the BBB to albumin. In situ brain perfusion and immunohistochemistry studies indicated that adrengerics act on transporters already at the luminal surface of brain endothelial cells. These results show that adrenergic stimulation, including monotherapy with clonidine, could be key for CNS enzyme replacement therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2129240838,"Currently, considerable interest exists with regard to the dissociation of close packed aminoacids within proteins, in the course of unfolding, which could result in either wet or dry moltenglobules. The progressive disjuncture of residues constituting the hydrophobic core ofcyclophilin from L. donovani (LdCyp) has been studied during the thermal unfolding of the molecule, by molecular dynamics simulations. LdCyp has been represented as a surface contactnetwork (SCN) based on the surface complementarity (Sm) of interacting residues within themolecular interior. The application of Sm to side chain packing within proteins make it a very sensitive indicator of subtle perturbations in packing, in the thermal unfolding of the protein. Network based metrics have been defined to track the sequential changes in the disintegration ofthe SCN spanning the hydrophobic core of LdCyp and these metrics prove to be highly sensitive compared to traditional metrics in indicating the increased conformational (and dynamical) flexibility in the network. These metrics have been applied to suggest criteria distinguishing DMG, WMG and transition state ensembles and to identify key residues involved in crucial conformational/topological events during the unfolding process."

This enzyme is functionally distinct from plasmin. Thrombolytic action of the enzyme was demonstrated in rat model. The potency of the plant enzyme in degrading fibrin and fibrin-plasma protein (Aβ, human serum albumin, lysozyme, transthyretin and fibronectin) co-aggregates was demonstrated by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy that showed better potency of the plant enzyme as compared to plasmin. Moreover, the plant enzyme inhibited localization of the co-aggregate inside SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and also co-aggregate induced cytotoxicity. Plasmin was inefficient in this respect. In the background of limited options for fragmentation of these co-aggregates, the plant enzyme may appear as a potential proteolytic enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2116752075,"Our possibility to appropriately detect, interpret and respond to climate-driven phenological changes depends on our ability to model and predict the changes. This ability may be hampered by non-linearity in climate-phenological relations, and by spatiotemporal variability and scale mismatches of climate and phenological data. A modeling methodology capable of handling such complexities can be a powerful tool for phenological change projection. Here we develop such a methodology using citizen scientists’ observations of first flight dates for orange tip butterflies (Anthocharis cardamines) in three areas extending along a steep climate gradient. The developed methodology links point data of first flight observations to calculated cumulative degree-days until first flight based on gridded temperature data. Using this methodology we identify and quantify a first flight model that is consistent across different regions, data support scales and assumptions of subgrid variability and observation bias. Model application to observed warming over the past 60 years demonstrates the model usefulness for assessment of climate-driven first flight change. The cross-regional consistency of the model implies predictive capability for future changes, and calls for further application and testing of analogous modeling approaches to other species, phenological variables and parts of the world."
https://openalex.org/W2255599438,"Subcutaneously growing tumors are widely utilized to study tumor angiogenesis and the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies in mice. To additionally assess functional and morphologic alterations of the vasculature in the periphery of a growing tumor, we exploited the easily accessible and hierarchically organized vasculature of the mouse auricle. By site-specific subcutaneous implantation of a defined preformed mouse B16/F0 melanoma aggregate, a solid tumor nodule developed within 14 d. Growth of the tumor nodule was accompanied by a 4-fold increase in its perfusion as well as a 2- to 4-fold elevated diameter and perfusion of peripheral blood vessels that had connected to the tumor capillary microvasculature. By transdermal application of the anticancer drug bortezomib, tumor growth was significantly diminished by about 50% without provoking side effects. Moreover, perfusion and tumor microvessel diameter as well as growth and perfusion of arterial or venous blood vessels supplying or draining the tumor microvasculature were decreased under these conditions by up to 80%. Collectively, we observed that the progressive tumor growth is accompanied by the enlargement of supplying and draining extratumoral blood vessels. This process was effectively suppressed by bortezomib, thereby restricting the perfusion capacity of both extra and intratumoral blood vessels."
