https://openalex.org/W3000319248,"Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder in which neuroinflammation has a critical function1. However, little is known about the contribution of the adaptive immune response in Alzheimer's disease2. Here, using integrated analyses of multiple cohorts, we identify peripheral and central adaptive immune changes in Alzheimer's disease. First, we performed mass cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and discovered an immune signature of Alzheimer's disease that consists of increased numbers of CD8+ T effector memory CD45RA+ (TEMRA) cells. In a second cohort, we found that CD8+ TEMRA cells were negatively associated with cognition. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that T cell receptor (TCR) signalling was enhanced in these cells. Notably, by using several strategies of single-cell TCR sequencing in a third cohort, we discovered clonally expanded CD8+ TEMRA cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we used machine learning, cloning and peptide screens to demonstrate the specificity of clonally expanded TCRs in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease to two separate Epstein-Barr virus antigens. These results reveal an adaptive immune response in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid in Alzheimer's disease and provide evidence of clonal, antigen-experienced T cells patrolling the intrathecal space of brains affected by age-related neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2999810289,"KRAS GTPases are activated in one-third of cancers, and KRAS(G12C) is one of the most common activating alterations in lung adenocarcinoma1,2. KRAS(G12C) inhibitors3,4 are in phase-I clinical trials and early data show partial responses in nearly half of patients with lung cancer. How cancer cells bypass inhibition to prevent maximal response to therapy is not understood. Because KRAS(G12C) cycles between an active and inactive conformation4-6, and the inhibitors bind only to the latter, we tested whether isogenic cell populations respond in a non-uniform manner by studying the effect of treatment at a single-cell resolution. Here we report that, shortly after treatment, some cancer cells are sequestered in a quiescent state with low KRAS activity, whereas others bypass this effect to resume proliferation. This rapid divergent response occurs because some quiescent cells produce new KRAS(G12C) in response to suppressed mitogen-activated protein kinase output. New KRAS(G12C) is maintained in its active, drug-insensitive state by epidermal growth factor receptor and aurora kinase signalling. Cells without these adaptive changes-or cells in which these changes are pharmacologically inhibited-remain sensitive to drug treatment, because new KRAS(G12C) is either not available or exists in its inactive, drug-sensitive state. The direct targeting of KRAS oncoproteins has been a longstanding objective in precision oncology. Our study uncovers a flexible non-uniform fitness mechanism that enables groups of cells within a population to rapidly bypass the effect of treatment. This adaptive process must be overcome if we are to achieve complete and durable responses in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2999978880,"More than twelve morphologically and physiologically distinct subtypes of primary somatosensory neuron report salient features of our internal and external environments1–4. It is unclear how specialized gene expression programs emerge during development to endow these subtypes with their unique properties. To assess the developmental progression of transcriptional maturation of each subtype of principal somatosensory neuron, we generated a transcriptomic atlas of cells traversing the primary somatosensory neuron lineage in mice. Here we show that somatosensory neurogenesis gives rise to neurons in a transcriptionally unspecialized state, characterized by co-expression of transcription factors that become restricted to select subtypes as development proceeds. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of sensory neurons from mutant mice lacking transcription factors suggest that these broad-to-restricted transcription factors coordinate subtype-specific gene expression programs in subtypes in which their expression is maintained. We also show that neuronal targets are involved in this process; disruption of the prototypic target-derived neurotrophic factor NGF leads to aberrant subtype-restricted patterns of transcription factor expression. Our findings support a model in which cues that emanate from intermediate and final target fields promote neuronal diversification in part by transitioning cells from a transcriptionally unspecialized state to transcriptionally distinct subtypes by modulating the selection of subtype-restricted transcription factors. Neuronal targets mediate the emergence of somatosensory neuron subtypes by altering the expression of neuronal transcription factors."

https://openalex.org/W3000568230,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are phenotypic plasticity processes that confer migratory and invasive properties to epithelial cells during development, wound-healing, fibrosis and cancer1-4. EMTs are driven by SNAIL, ZEB and TWIST transcription factors5,6 together with microRNAs that balance this regulatory network7,8. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a potent inducer of developmental and fibrogenic EMTs4,9,10. Aberrant TGF-β signalling and EMT are implicated in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis and cancer4,11. TGF-β depends on RAS and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inputs for the induction of EMTs12-19. Here we show how these signals coordinately trigger EMTs and integrate them with broader pathophysiological processes. We identify RAS-responsive element binding protein 1 (RREB1), a RAS transcriptional effector20,21, as a key partner of TGF-β-activated SMAD transcription factors in EMT. MAPK-activated RREB1 recruits TGF-β-activated SMAD factors to SNAIL. Context-dependent chromatin accessibility dictates the ability of RREB1 and SMAD to activate additional genes that determine the nature of the resulting EMT. In carcinoma cells, TGF-β-SMAD and RREB1 directly drive expression of SNAIL and fibrogenic factors stimulating myofibroblasts, promoting intratumoral fibrosis and supporting tumour growth. In mouse epiblast progenitors, Nodal-SMAD and RREB1 combine to induce expression of SNAIL and mesendoderm-differentiation genes that drive gastrulation. Thus, RREB1 provides a molecular link between RAS and TGF-β pathways for coordinated induction of developmental and fibrogenic EMTs. These insights increase our understanding of the regulation of epithelial plasticity and its pathophysiological consequences in development, fibrosis and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3000631101,"The segmental organization of the vertebral column is established early in embryogenesis, when pairs of somites are rhythmically produced by the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). The tempo of somite formation is controlled by a molecular oscillator known as the segmentation clock1,2. Although this oscillator has been well-characterized in model organisms1,2, whether a similar oscillator exists in humans remains unknown. Genetic analyses of patients with severe spine segmentation defects have implicated several human orthologues of cyclic genes that are associated with the mouse segmentation clock, suggesting that this oscillator might be conserved in humans3. Here we show that human PSM cells derived in vitro-as well as those of the mouse4-recapitulate the oscillations of the segmentation clock. Human PSM cells oscillate with a period two times longer than that of mouse cells (5 h versus 2.5 h), but are similarly regulated by FGF, WNT, Notch and YAP signalling5. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that mouse and human PSM cells in vitro follow a developmental trajectory similar to that of mouse PSM in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FGF signalling controls the phase and period of oscillations, expanding the role of this pathway beyond its classical interpretation in 'clock and wavefront' models1. Our work identifying the human segmentation clock represents an important milestone in understanding human developmental biology."
https://openalex.org/W3000083217,"Class B G-protein-coupled receptors are major targets for the treatment of chronic diseases, including diabetes and obesity1. Structures of active receptors reveal peptide agonists engage deep within the receptor core, leading to an outward movement of extracellular loop 3 and the tops of transmembrane helices 6 and 7, an inward movement of transmembrane helix 1, reorganization of extracellular loop 2 and outward movement of the intracellular side of transmembrane helix 6, resulting in G-protein interaction and activation2–6. Here we solved the structure of a non-peptide agonist, TT-OAD2, bound to the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor. Our structure identified an unpredicted non-peptide agonist-binding pocket in which reorganization of extracellular loop 3 and transmembrane helices 6 and 7 manifests independently of direct ligand interaction within the deep transmembrane domain pocket. TT-OAD2 exhibits biased agonism, and kinetics of G-protein activation and signalling that are distinct from peptide agonists. Within the structure, TT-OAD2 protrudes beyond the receptor core to interact with the lipid or detergent, providing an explanation for the distinct activation kinetics that may contribute to the clinical efficacy of this compound series. This work alters our understanding of the events that drive the activation of class B receptors. The structure of GLP-1R and its G protein in complex with the small molecule TT-OAD2 sheds light on how the TT-OAD2 agonist can activate the receptor and provides insights into the development of therapeutic agents for metabolic disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2999001800,"The partial pressure of CO2 in the oceans has increased rapidly over the past century, driving ocean acidification and raising concern for the stability of marine ecosystems1-3. Coral reef fishes are predicted to be especially susceptible to end-of-century ocean acidification on the basis of several high-profile papers4,5 that have reported profound behavioural and sensory impairments-for example, complete attraction to the chemical cues of predators under conditions of ocean acidification. Here, we comprehensively and transparently show that-in contrast to previous studies-end-of-century ocean acidification levels have negligible effects on important behaviours of coral reef fishes, such as the avoidance of chemical cues from predators, fish activity levels and behavioural lateralization (left-right turning preference). Using data simulations, we additionally show that the large effect sizes and small within-group variances that have been reported in several previous studies are highly improbable. Together, our findings indicate that the reported effects of ocean acidification on the behaviour of coral reef fishes are not reproducible, suggesting that behavioural perturbations will not be a major consequence for coral reef fishes in high CO2 oceans."
https://openalex.org/W3000138169,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired through homology-directed repair (HDR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). BRCA1/2-deficient cancer cells cannot perform HDR, conferring sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). However, concomitant loss of the pro-NHEJ factors 53BP1, RIF1, REV7-Shieldin (SHLD1-3) or CST-DNA polymerase alpha (Pol-α) in BRCA1-deficient cells restores HDR and PARPi resistance. Here, we identify the TRIP13 ATPase as a negative regulator of REV7. We show that REV7 exists in active 'closed' and inactive 'open' conformations, and TRIP13 catalyses the inactivating conformational change, thereby dissociating REV7-Shieldin to promote HDR. TRIP13 similarly disassembles the REV7-REV3 translesion synthesis (TLS) complex, a component of the Fanconi anaemia pathway, inhibiting error-prone replicative lesion bypass and interstrand crosslink repair. Importantly, TRIP13 overexpression is common in BRCA1-deficient cancers, confers PARPi resistance and correlates with poor prognosis. Thus, TRIP13 emerges as an important regulator of DNA repair pathway choice-promoting HDR, while suppressing NHEJ and TLS."

https://openalex.org/W3000478494,"Although maternal antibodies protect newborn babies from infection1,2, little is known about how protective antibodies are induced without prior pathogen exposure. Here we show that neonatal mice that lack the capacity to produce IgG are protected from infection with the enteric pathogen enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by maternal natural IgG antibodies against the maternal microbiota when antibodies are delivered either across the placenta or through breast milk. By challenging pups that were fostered by either maternal antibody-sufficient or antibody-deficient dams, we found that IgG derived from breast milk was crucial for protection against mucosal disease induced by enterotoxigenic E. coli. IgG also provides protection against systemic infection by E. coli. Pups used the neonatal Fc receptor to transfer IgG from milk into serum. The maternal commensal microbiota can induce antibodies that recognize antigens expressed by enterotoxigenic E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae species. Induction of maternal antibodies against a commensal Pantoea species confers protection against enterotoxigenic E. coli in pups. This role of the microbiota in eliciting protective antibodies to a specific neonatal pathogen represents an important host defence mechanism against infection in neonates."
https://openalex.org/W2999129979,"Precise protein sequencing and folding are believed to generate the structure and chemical diversity of natural channels1,2, both of which are essential to synthetically achieve proton transport performance comparable to that seen in natural systems. Geometrically defined channels have been fabricated using peptides, DNAs, carbon nanotubes, sequence-defined polymers and organic frameworks3-13. However, none of these channels rivals the performance observed in their natural counterparts. Here we show that without forming an atomically structured channel, four-monomer-based random heteropolymers (RHPs)14 can mimic membrane proteins and exhibit selective proton transport across lipid bilayers at a rate similar to those of natural proton channels. Statistical control over the monomer distribution in an RHP leads to segmental heterogeneity in hydrophobicity, which facilitates the insertion of single RHPs into the lipid bilayers. It also results in bilayer-spanning segments containing polar monomers that promote the formation of hydrogen-bonded chains15,16 for proton transport. Our study demonstrates the importance of the adaptability that is enabled by statistical similarity among RHP chains and of the modularity provided by the chemical diversity of monomers, to achieve uniform behaviour in heterogeneous systems. Our results also validate statistical randomness as an unexplored approach to realize protein-like behaviour at the single-polymer-chain level in a predictable manner."
https://openalex.org/W2999148389,"Possible involvement of complement (C) systems in the pathogenesis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) was investigated by quantifying Cproteins in plasma astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) of subjects with sports-related TBI (sTBI) and TBI in military veterans (mtTBI) without cognitive impairment. All sTBI subjects (n = 24) had mild injuries, whereas eight of the mtTBI subjects had moderate, and 17 had mild injuries. Plasma levels of ADEs were decreased after acute sTBI and returned to normal within months. Cprotein levels in ADEs were from 12- to 35-fold higher than the corresponding levels in neuron-derived exosomes. CD81 exosome marker-normalized ADE levels of classical pathway C4b, alternative pathway factor D and Bb, lectin pathway mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and shared neurotoxic effectors C3b and C5b-9 terminal C complex were significantly higher and those of C regulatory proteins CR1 and CD59 were lower in the first week of acute sTBI (n = 12) than in controls (n = 12). Most C abnormalities were no longer detected in chronic sTBI at 3-12 months after acute sTBI, except for elevated levels of factor D, Bb, and MBL. In contrast, significant elevations of ADE levels of C4b, factor D, Bb, MBL, C3b and C5b-9 terminal C complex, and depressions of CR1 and CD59 relative to those of controls were observed after 1-4 years in early chronic mtTBI (n = 10) and persisted for decades except for normalization of Bb, MBL, and CD59 in late chronic mtTBI (n = 15). Complement inhibitors may be useful therapeutically in acute TBI and post-concussion syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2999938474,"Changes in behaviour resulting from environmental influences, development and learning1–5 are commonly quantified on the basis of a few hand-picked features2–4,6,7 (for example, the average pitch of acoustic vocalizations3), assuming discrete classes of behaviours (such as distinct vocal syllables)2,3,8–10. However, such methods generalize poorly across different behaviours and model systems and may miss important components of change. Here we present a more-general account of behavioural change that is based on nearest-neighbour statistics11–13, and apply it to song development in a songbird, the zebra finch3. First, we introduce the concept of ‘repertoire dating’, whereby each rendition of a behaviour (for example, each vocalization) is assigned a repertoire time, reflecting when similar renditions were typical in the behavioural repertoire. Repertoire time isolates the components of vocal variability that are congruent with long-term changes due to vocal learning and development, and stratifies the behavioural repertoire into ‘regressions’, ‘anticipations’ and ‘typical renditions’. Second, we obtain a holistic, yet low-dimensional, description of vocal change in terms of a stratified ‘behavioural trajectory’, revealing numerous previously unrecognized components of behavioural change on fast and slow timescales, as well as distinct patterns of overnight consolidation1,2,4,14,15 across the behavioral repertoire. We find that diurnal changes in regressions undergo only weak consolidation, whereas anticipations and typical renditions consolidate fully. Because of its generality, our nonparametric description of how behaviour evolves relative to itself—rather than to a potentially arbitrary, experimenter-defined goal2,3,14,16—appears well suited for comparing learning and change across behaviours and species17,18, as well as biological and artificial systems5. A new method for analysing change in high-dimensional data is based on nearest-neighbour statistics and is applied here to song dynamics during vocal learning in zebra finches, but could potentially be applied to other biological and artificial behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2999294672,"Sestrins represent a family of stress-inducible proteins that prevent the progression of many age- and obesity-associated disorders. Endogenous Sestrins maintain insulin-dependent AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) activation during high-fat diet–induced obesity, and overexpressed Sestrins activate AKT in various cell types, including liver and skeletal muscle cells. Although Sestrin-mediated AKT activation improves metabolic parameters, the mechanistic details underlying such improvement remain elusive. Here, we investigated how Sestrin2, the Sestrin homolog highly expressed in liver, induces strong AKT activation. We found that two known targets of Sestrin2, mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and AMP-activated protein kinase, are not required for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Rather, phosphoinositol 3-kinase and mTORC2, kinases upstream of AKT, were essential for Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. Among these kinases, mTORC2 catalytic activity was strongly up-regulated upon Sestrin2 overexpression in an in vitro kinase assay, indicating that mTORC2 may represent the major link between Sestrin2 and AKT. As reported previously, Sestrin2 interacted with mTORC2; however, we found here that this interaction occurs indirectly through GATOR2, a pentameric protein complex that directly interacts with Sestrin2. Deleting or silencing WDR24 (WD repeat domain 24), the GATOR2 component essential for the Sestrin2–GATOR2 interaction, or WDR59, the GATOR2 component essential for the GATOR2–mTORC2 interaction, completely ablated Sestrin2-induced AKT activation. We also noted that Sestrin2 also directly binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT and induces AKT translocation to the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W3000238224,"Climate change in the Arctic is occurring rapidly, and projections suggest the complete loss of summer sea ice by the middle of this century1. The sensitivity of permanently frozen ground (permafrost) in the Northern Hemisphere to warming is less clear, and its long-term trends are harder to monitor than those of sea ice. Here we use palaeoclimate data to show that Siberian permafrost is robust to warming when Arctic sea ice is present, but vulnerable when it is absent. Uranium-lead chronology of carbonate deposits (speleothems) in a Siberian cave located at the southern edge of continuous permafrost reveals periods in which the overlying ground was not permanently frozen. The speleothem record starts 1.5 million years ago (Ma), a time when greater equator-to-pole heat transport led to a warmer Northern Hemisphere2. The growth of the speleothems indicates that permafrost at the cave site was absent at that time, becoming more frequent from about 1.35 Ma, as the Northern Hemisphere cooled, and permanent after about 0.4 Ma. This history mirrors that of year-round sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, which was largely absent before about 0.4 Ma (ref. 3), but continuously present since that date. The robustness of permafrost when sea ice is present, as well as the increased permafrost vulnerability when sea ice is absent, can be explained by changes in both heat and moisture transport. Reduced sea ice may contribute to warming of Arctic air4-6, which can lead to warming far inland7. Open Arctic waters also increase the source of moisture and increase autumn snowfall over Siberia, insulating the ground from low winter temperatures8-10. These processes explain the relationship between an ice-free Arctic and permafrost thawing before 0.4 Ma. If these processes continue during modern climate change, future loss of summer Arctic sea ice will accelerate the thawing of Siberian permafrost."
https://openalex.org/W2999017921,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a frequently occurred microvascular complication associated with type I and type II diabetes mellitus. The participation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in diabetes-related microvascular complications has been reported extensively. We attempted to unveil the possible regulatory mechanism of lncRNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), an important inflammatory protein, in the progression of DN. A rat DN model was induced by streptozocin (STZ). The low expression of GAS5 and high expression of MMP9 in DN rats with DN was then determined by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis, and lentivirus-mediated GAS5 overexpression was shown to ameliorate STZ-induced renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) and inflammatory reaction in the kidney of DN rats. Moreover, MMP9 was found to be upregulated in STZ-induced DN, while MMP9 silencing induced by lentivirus expressing shRNA against MMP9 reduced RIF and suppressed inflammation in the kidney of DN rats. RIP, RNA pull-down, and ChIP assays demonstrated that GAS5 downregulated MMP9 via recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in the promoter region of MMP9. Overall, our study reveals that GAS5 downregulates MMP9 expression through recruiting EZH2 to MMP9 promoter region and alleviates the progression of renal fibrosis in DN rats, which sheds new light on the therapeutic potential of GAS5-targeted therapies in combating that disease."
https://openalex.org/W2999341063,"Sphingolipids are multifunctional lipids. Among the sphingolipid-component sphingoid bases, 4,14-sphingadiene (SPD) is unique such that it has a cis double bond with a bent structure. Although SPD was discovered half a century ago, its tissue distribution, biosynthesis, and degradation remain poorly understood. Here, we established a specific and quantitative method for SPD measurement and found that SPD exists in a wide range of mammalian tissues. SPD was especially abundant in kidney, where the amount of SPD was ~2/3 of sphingosine, the most abundant sphingoid base in mammals. Although SPD is metabolized to ceramides and SPD 1-phosphate with almost the same efficiency as sphingosine, it is less susceptible to degradation by a cleavage reaction, at least in vitro. We identified the fatty acid desaturase family protein FADS3 as a ceramide desaturase that produces SPD ceramides by desaturating ceramides containing sphingosine. SPD sphingolipids were preferentially localized outside lipid microdomains, suggesting that SPD has different functions compared to other sphingoid bases in the formation of lipid microdomains. In summary, we revealed the biosynthesis and degradation pathways of SPD and its characteristic membrane localization. Our findings contribute to the elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying the generation of sphingolipid diversity."

The aim of this study is to investigate whether socioeconomic and demographic factors are associated with gender differences in insomnia and subtypes in Korean population. Method The present study used data from the nationwide, cross-sectional study on sleep among all Koreans aged 19 to 69 years. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was used to classify insomnia symptoms and their subtypes (cutoff value: 9.5). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Goldberg Anxiety Scale (GAS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to measure sleep quality, anxiety and depression. Results A total of 2695 participants completed the survey. The overall prevalence of insomnia symptoms was 10.7%, including difficulty in initiating sleep (DIS) (6.8%), difficulty in maintaining sleep (DMS) (6.5%) and early morning awakening (EMA) (6.5%), and these symptoms were more prevalent in women than in men. Multivariate analysis showed that female gender, shorter sleep time and psychiatric complications were found to be independent predictors for insomnia symptoms and subtypes. After adjusting for covariates among these factors, female gender remained a significant risk factor for insomnia symptoms and their subtypes. As for men, low income was related to insomnia. Conclusion Approximately one-tenth of the sample from the Korean general population had insomnia symptoms. The prevalence of insomnia symptom and the subtypes were more prevalent in women than men. Gender is an independent factor for insomnia symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2999645974,"Dilated eye exams are the standard of care to detect advancing, vision threatening, but often asymptomatic retinopathy in a timely fashion, allowing for vision preserving treatments. Annual exam rates are suboptimal, especially in underserved populations. Although teleophthalmology programs tremendously improve annual exam rates in low income/under resourced settings, widespread adoption is limited. Using a mixed methods approach, three focus groups and individual interviews were conducted for patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 23) who had a teleophthalmology exam or a dilated eye exam. A survey and discussion assessed patients’ perspectives and value of teleophthalmology, including willingness to pay (WTP). Financial, transportation, and motivational barriers to obtaining an annual dilated eye exam were identified. Patients greatly valued having primary care (PC) based teleophthalmology for its convenience and ability to detect disease to allow for timely treatment and would recommend such a service. Although their WTP was at least the amount of their usual copay, cost was universally cited as a concern. Having a conveniently offered PC based teleophthalmology exam was valued. Educating patients on the value and costs of having such exams may be helpful to encourage informed discussions on eye care, especially in low income, underserved populations. Our study is among the few to provide insight on the value and perceptions of teleophthalmology in US low income, urban minority populations needed to help increase uptake of this innovation. Using surveys followed by facilitated discussion allowed for richer and more varied responses."
https://openalex.org/W2999910324,"The major milestones in mouse placental development are well described, but our understanding is limited to how the placenta can adapt to damage or changes in the environment. By using stereology and expression of cell cycle markers, we found that the placenta grows under normal conditions not just by hyperplasia of trophoblast cells but also through extensive polyploidy and cell hypertrophy. In response to feeding a low protein diet to mothers prior to and during pregnancy, to mimic chronic malnutrition, we found that this normal program was altered and that it was influenced by the sex of the conceptus. Male fetuses showed intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) by embryonic day (E) 18.5, just before term, whereas female fetuses showed IUGR as early as E16.5. This difference was correlated with differences in the size of the labyrinth layer of the placenta, the site of nutrient and gas exchange. Functional changes were implied based on up-regulation of nutrient transporter genes. The junctional zone was also affected, with a reduction in both glycogen trophoblast and spongiotrophoblast cells. These changes were associated with increased expression of Phlda2 and reduced expression of Egfr. Polyploidy, which results from endoreduplication, is a normal feature of trophoblast giant cells (TGC) but also spongiotrophoblast cells. Ploidy was increased in sinusoidal-TGCs and spongiotrophoblast cells, but not parietal-TGCs, in low protein placentas. These results indicate that the placenta undergoes a range of changes in development and function in response to poor maternal diet, many of which we interpret are aimed at mitigating the impacts on fetal and maternal health."
https://openalex.org/W2999943660,"Receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is a one-pass transmembrane protein upregulated in cancers and associated with lower survival and therapy resistance. AXL can be cleaved by the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinases (ADAM)10 and ADAM17, yielding a soluble version of the protein. Elevated soluble AXL (sAXL) has been reported to be associated with disease progression in hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cancer, neurofibromatosis type 1 and inflammatory diseases. In the present work, we analyzed sAXL levels in blood from melanoma patients and showed that sAXL increases with disease progression. Additionally, increased sAXL levels were found correlated with shorter two-year survival in stage IV patients treated with ipilimumab. Furthermore, we showed that sAXL levels were related to the percentage of cells expressing AXL in resected melanoma lymph node metastases. This finding was verified in vitro, where sAXL levels in the cell media corresponded to AXL expression in the cells. AXL inhibition using the small-molecular inhibitor BGB324 reduced sAXL levels, while the cellular expression was elevated through increased protein stability. Our findings signify that quantification of sAXL blood levels is a simple and easily assessable method to determine cellular AXL levels and should be further evaluated for its use as a biomarker of disease progression and treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W3000396395,"Late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with four well-established risk factors: age, APOE4 genotype, female chromosomal sex, and maternal history of AD. Each risk factor impacts multiple systems, making LOAD a complex systems biology challenge. To investigate interactions between LOAD risk factors, we performed multiple scale analyses, including metabolomics, transcriptomics, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and beta-amyloid assessment, in 16 months old male and female mice with humanized human APOE3 (hAPOE3) or APOE4 (hAPOE4) genes. Metabolomic analyses indicated a sex difference in plasma profile whereas APOE genotype determined brain metabolic profile. Consistent with the brain metabolome, gene and pathway-based RNA-Seq analyses of the hippocampus indicated increased expression of fatty acid/lipid metabolism related genes and pathways in both hAPOE4 males and females. Further, female transcription of fatty acid and amino acids pathways were significantly different from males. MRI based imaging analyses indicated that in multiple white matter tracts, hAPOE4 males and females exhibited lower fractional anisotropy than their hAPOE3 counterparts, suggesting a lower level of white matter integrity in hAPOE4 mice. Consistent with the brain metabolomic and transcriptomic profile of hAPOE4 carriers, beta-amyloid generation was detectable in 16-month-old male and female brains. These data provide therapeutic targets based on chromosomal sex and APOE genotype. Collectively, these data provide a framework for developing precision medicine interventions during the prodromal phase of LOAD, when the potential to reverse, prevent and delay LOAD progression is greatest."

Here we present improved molecular assays developed for detection of ChHV5, in combination with a robust molecular and phylogenetic analysis of ChHV5 variants. This approach utilised a multi-gene assay to detect ChHV5 in all FP tumors sampled from 62 marine turtles found at six foraging grounds along the Great Barrier Reef. Six distinct variants of ChHV5 were identified and the distribution of these variants was associated with host foraging ground. Conversely, no association between host genetic origin and ChHV5 viral variant was found. Together this evidence supports the hypothesis that marine turtles undergo horizontal transmission of ChHV5 at foraging grounds and are unlikely to be contracting the disease at rookeries, either during mating or vertically from parent to offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2999240916,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the most deadly cancer of the female reproductive system. To date, there is no effective screening method for early detection of OC and current diagnostic armamentarium may include sonographic grading of the tumor and analyzing serum levels of tumor markers, Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) and Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4). Microorganisms (bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells) residing in mucosal tissues including the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts can be altered by different disease states, and these shifts in microbial dynamics may help to diagnose disease states. We hypothesized that the peritoneal microbial environment was altered in patients with OC and that inclusion of selected peritoneal microbial features with current clinical features into prediction analyses will improve detection accuracy of patients with OC. Blood and peritoneal fluid were collected from consented patients that had sonography confirmed adnexal masses and were being seen at SIU School of Medicine Simmons Cancer Institute. Blood was processed and serum HE4 and CA-125 were measured. Peritoneal fluid was collected at the time of surgery and processed for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) using 16S V4 exon bacterial primers and bioinformatics analyses. We found that patients with OC had a unique peritoneal microbial profile compared to patients with a benign mass. Using ensemble modeling and machine learning pathways, we identified 18 microbial features that were highly specific to OC pathology. Prediction analyses confirmed that inclusion of microbial features with serum tumor marker levels and control features (patient age and BMI) improved diagnostic accuracy compared to currently used models. We conclude that OC pathogenesis alters the peritoneal microbial environment and that these unique microbial features are important for accurate diagnosis of OC. Our study warrants further analyses of the importance of microbial features in regards to oncological diagnostics and possible prognostic and interventional medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2998755343,"Black patinas are very common biological deterioration phenomena on lapideous artworks in outdoor environments. These substrates, exposed to sunlight, and atmospheric and environmental agents (i.e. wind and temperature changes), represent extreme environments that can only be colonized by highly versatile and adaptable microorganisms. Black patinas comprise a wide variety of microorganisms, but the morphological plasticity of most of these microorganisms hinders their identification by optical microscopy. This study used Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) (including shotgun and amplicon sequencing) to characterize the black patina of the travertine embankments (muraglioni) of the Tiber River in Rome (Italy). Overall, the sequencing highlighted the rich diversity of bacterial and fungal communities and allowed the identification of more than one hundred taxa. NGS confirmed the relevance of coccoid and filamentous cyanobacteria observed by optical microscopy and revealed an informative landscape of the fungal community underlining the presence of microcolonial fungi and phylloplane yeasts. For the first time high-throughput sequencing allowed the exploration of the expansive diversity of bacteria in black patina, which has so far been overlooked in routine analyses. Furthermore, the identification of euendolithic microorganisms and weathering agents underlines the biodegradative role of black patina, which has often been underestimated. Therefore, the use of NGS to characterize black patinas could be useful in choosing appropriate conservation treatments and in the monitoring of stone colonization after the restoration interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2999721487,"The enzyme glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) is involved in detoxifying chemicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we provide a significant insight into the role of GSTT1 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We identified decreased expression of GSTT1 in inflamed colons from IBD patients compared to controls. We intrarectally or intraperitoneally delivered Gstt1 gene to mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and noted attenuation of colitis through gene transfer of Gstt1 via an IL-22 dependent pathway. Downregulation of GSTT1 by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of microbes reduced innate defense responses and goblet cell differentiation. The GSTT1 mutation in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and IBD patients decreased its dimerization, which was connected to insufficient phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase by their common activator, IL-22. GSTT1 ameliorated colitis and contributed as a modulator of goblet cells through sensing pathogens and host immune responses. Its mutations are linked to chronic intestinal inflammation due to its insufficient dimerization. Our results provide new insights into GSTT1 mutations that are linked to chronic intestinal inflammation due to its insufficient dimerization and their functional consequences in IBDs."
https://openalex.org/W2999921467,"Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a natural pigment, found in many colorful fruits and vegetables. It has many health benefits, including anti-inflammation, cancer prevention, and anti-diabetes. Although C3G is assumed to be an antioxidant, it has been reported to affect cell-matrix adhesions. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that the expression of talin1, a key regulator of integrins and cell adhesions, negatively correlated with the survival rate of colon cancer patients and that depletion of talin1 inhibited 3D spheroid growth in colon cancer cells. Interestingly, C3G bound to talin and promoted the interaction of talin with β1A-integrin. Molecular docking analysis shows that C3G binds to the interface of the talin-β-integrin complex, acting as an allosteric regulator and altering the interaction between talin and integrin. Moreover, C3G promoted colon cancer cell attachment to fibronectin. While C3G had no significant effect on colon cancer cell proliferation, it significantly inhibited 3D spheroid growth in fibrin gel assays. Since C3G has no or very low toxicity, it could be potentially used for colon cancer prevention or therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2999933654,"ISOC is a cation current permeating the ISOC channel. In pulmonary endothelial cells, ISOC activation leads to formation of inter-endothelial cell gaps and barrier disruption. The immunophilin FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), in conjunction with the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 5C (PPP5C), inhibits ISOC . Free PPP5C assumes an autoinhibitory state, which has low ""basal"" catalytic activity. Several S100 protein family members bind PPP5C increasing PPP5C catalytic activity in vitro. One of these family members, S100A6, exhibits a calcium-dependent translocation to the plasma membrane. The goal of this study was to determine whether S100A6 activates PPP5C in pulmonary endothelial cells and contributes to ISOC inhibition by the PPP5C-FKBP51 axis. We observed that S100A6 activates PPP5C to dephosphorylate tau T231. Following ISOC activation, cytosolic S100A6 translocates to the plasma membrane and interacts with the TRPC4 subunit of the ISOC channel. Global calcium entry and ISOC are decreased by S100A6 in a PPP5C-dependent manner and by FKBP51 in a S100A6-dependent manner. Further, calcium entry-induced endothelial barrier disruption is decreased by S100A6 dependent upon PPP5C, and by FKBP51 dependent upon S100A6. Overall, these data reveal that S100A6 plays a key role in the PPP5C-FKBP51 axis to inhibit ISOC and protect the endothelial barrier against calcium entry-induced disruption."
https://openalex.org/W3000442179,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) is common clinical complication, which represents significant challenge in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) diseases. Interleukin 35 (IL-35) exhibits anti-inflammatory properties via the engagement of the gp130, IL-12Rβ2 and IL-27Rα receptors. However, whether IL-35 plays a beneficial role in the treatment of MIRI and potential underling mechanism are unclear. We showed that IL-35 conferred protection from MIRI as demonstrated by reduced infarct size and cardiac troponin T, improved cardiac function and decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a mouse model. Despite activation of both STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in the heart by IL-35, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) was essential for mediating the IL-35-mediated protective effect on MIRI using cardiomyocyte-specific STAT3 deficient mice. Furthermore, gp130 was required for the STAT3 activation and cardio-protection induced by IL-35. Interestingly, IL-35 induced gp130 homodimer and gp130/IL-12Rβ2 heterodimers in cardiomyocyte. Our results indicate that IL-35 can execute a protective role against MIRI through a novel signaling pathway, IL-35-gp130-STAT3 pathway, in cardiomyocytes, which may be beneficial for the development of novel and effective therapeutic approaches to treat the MIRI."
https://openalex.org/W2999835227,"Vitamin B1 (thiamin) deficiency is an issue periodically affecting a wide range of taxa worldwide. In aquatic pelagic systems, thiamin is mainly produced by bacteria and phytoplankton and is transferred to fish and birds via zooplankton, but there is no general consensus on when or why this transfer is disrupted. We focus on the occurrence in salmon (Salmo salar) of a thiamin deficiency syndrome (M74), the incidence of which is highly correlated among populations derived from different spawning rivers. Here, we show that M74 in salmon is associated with certain large-scale abiotic changes in the main common feeding area of salmon in the southern Baltic Sea. Years with high M74 incidence were characterized by stagnant periods with relatively low salinity and phosphate and silicate concentrations but high total nitrogen. Consequently, there were major changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton, with, e.g., increased abundances of Cryptophyceae, Dinophyceae, Diatomophyceae and Euglenophyceae and Acartia spp. during high M74 incidence years. The prey fish communities also had increased stocks of both herring and sprat in these years. Overall, this suggests important changes in the entire food web structure and nutritional pathways in the common feeding period during high M74 incidence years. Previous research has emphasized the importance of the abundance of planktivorous fish for the occurrence of M74. By using this 27-year time series, we expand this analysis to the entire ecosystem and discuss potential mechanisms inducing thiamin deficiency in salmon."
https://openalex.org/W2999267010,"Most eukaryotic cells generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) to support cellular activities. In cultured cell-based experiments, we recently identified the hypoxia-inducible protein G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0s2) as a positive regulator of OXPHOS, and showed that G0s2 protects cultured cardiomyocytes from hypoxia. In this study, we examined the in vivo protective role of G0s2 against hypoxia by generating both loss-of-function and gain-of-function models of g0s2 in zebrafish. Zebrafish harboring transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated knockout of g0s2 lost hypoxic tolerance. Conversely, cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic zebrafish hearts exhibited strong tolerance against hypoxia. To clarify the mechanism by which G0s2 protects cardiac function under hypoxia, we introduced a mitochondrially targeted FRET-based ATP biosensor into zebrafish heart to visualize ATP dynamics in in vivo beating hearts. In addition, we employed a mosaic overexpression model of g0s2 to compare the contraction and ATP dynamics between g0s2-expressing and non-expressing cardiomyocytes, side-by-side within the same heart. These techniques revealed that g0s2-expressing cardiomyocyte populations exhibited preserved contractility coupled with maintained intra-mitochondrial ATP concentrations even under hypoxic condition. Collectively, these results demonstrate that G0s2 provides ischemic tolerance in vivo by maintaining ATP production, and therefore represents a promising therapeutic target for hypoxia-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2999950621,"Torque teno virus (TTV) is an unenveloped, circular, single stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 3.8 kb. Previous studies have demonstrated varying grades of association between TTV DNA levels and immune deficiencies related to age, chronic infections and cancer. Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been related to persistent viral infections such as HSV-1 and CMV, but it is not known whether TTV viral load could serve as a functional biomarker of cellular immunity in this setting. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether TTV infection and viral load is related to AD status, CMV immunity, systemic inflammation or HLA types connected to anti-viral immunity. A total of 50 AD subjects and 51 non-demented controls were included in the study. AD subjects were diagnosed according to NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria and neuroradiologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis. TTV viral load was analyzed in plasma samples using a quantitative real-time PCR. Using a cut-off for TTV status at 200 copies/ml, 88% (89/101) of the study subjects were classified as TTV positive. TTV viral load significantly increased with age (beta 0.049 per year, p<0.001) but significantly decreased in relation to CMV IgG levels (beta -0.022 per 1000 units, p = 0.005) and HLA-B27 positivity (beta -0.53, p = 0.023). In conclusion, TTV immune control is not significantly affected by AD status, but appears related to age, CMV humoral immune response and HLA type."
https://openalex.org/W3000543357,"Ty1 is one of the many transposons in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The life-cycle of Ty1 shows numerous similarities with that of retroviruses, e.g. the initially synthesized polyprotein precursor undergoes proteolytic processing by the protease. The retroviral proteases have become important targets of current antiretroviral therapies due to the critical role of the limited proteolysis of Gag-Pol polyprotein in the replication cycle and they therefore belong to the most well-studied enzymes. Comparative analyses of retroviral and retroviral-like proteases can help to explore the key similarities and differences which may help understanding how resistance is developed against protease inhibitors, but the available information about the structural and biochemical characteristics of retroviral-like, and especially retrotransposon, proteases is limited. To investigate the main characteristics of Ty1 retrotransposon protease of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, untagged and His6-tagged forms of Ty1 protease were expressed in E. coli. After purification of the recombinant proteins, activity measurements were performed using synthetic oligopeptide and fluorescent recombinant protein substrates, which represented the wild-type and the modified forms of naturally occurring cleavage sites of the protease. We investigated the dependence of enzyme activity on different reaction conditions (pH, temperature, ionic strength, and urea concentration), and determined enzyme kinetic parameters for the studied substrates. Inhibitory potentials of 10 different protease inhibitors were also tested. Ty1 protease was not inhibited by the inhibitors which have been designed against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease and are approved as antiretroviral therapeutics. A quaternary structure of homodimeric Ty1 protease was proposed based on homology modeling, and this structure was used to support interpretation of experimental results and to correlate some structural and biochemical characteristics with that of other retroviral proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2998847231,"Pulmonary edema associated with increased vascular permeability is a severe complication of Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa-induced acute lung injury. The mechanisms underlying P aeruginosa-induced vascular permeability are not well understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of neuronal Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) in modulating P aeruginosa-induced vascular permeability. Using lung microvascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells, we demonstrated that N-WASP downregulation attenuated P aeruginosa-induced actin stress fiber formation and prevented paracellular permeability. P aeruginosa-induced dissociation between VE-cadherin and β-catenin, but increased association between N-WASP and VE-cadherin, suggesting a role for N-WASP in promoting P aeruginosa-induced adherens junction rupture. P aeruginosa increased N-WASP-Y256 phosphorylation, which required the activation of Rho GTPase and focal adhesion kinase. Increased N-WASP-Y256 phosphorylation promotes N-WASP and integrin αVβ6 association as well as TGF-β-mediated permeability across alveolar epithelial cells. Inhibition of N-WASP-Y256 phosphorylation by N-WASP-Y256F overexpression blocked N-WASP effects in P aeruginosa-induced actin stress fiber formation and increased paracellular permeability. In vivo, N-WASP knockdown attenuated the development of pulmonary edema and improved survival in a mouse model of P aeruginosa pneumonia. Together, our data demonstrate that N-WASP plays an essential role in P aeruginosa-induced vascular permeability and pulmonary edema through the modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2999171829,"In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), leukocyte infiltration of the pancreatic islets and the resulting immune-mediated destruction of beta cells precede hyperglycemia and clinical disease symptoms. In this context, the role of the pancreatic endothelium as a barrier for autoimmunity- and inflammation-related destruction of the islets is not well studied. Here, we identified Robo4, expressed on endothelial cells, as a regulator of pancreatic vascular endothelial permeability during autoimmune diabetes. Circulating levels of Robo4 were upregulated in mice subjected to the Multiple Low-Dose Streptozotocin (MLDS) model of diabetes. Upon MLDS induction, Robo4-deficiency resulted in increased pancreatic vascular permeability, leukocyte infiltration to the islets and islet apoptosis, associated with reduced insulin levels and faster diabetes development. On the contrary, in vivo administration of Slit2 in mice modestly delayed the emergence of hyperglycaemia and ameliorated islet inflammation in MLDS-induced diabetes. Thus, Robo4-mediated endothelial barrier integrity reduces insulitis and islet destruction in autoimmune diabetes. Our findings highlight the importance of the endothelium as gatekeeper of pancreatic inflammation during T1DM development and may pave the way for novel Robo4-related therapeutic approaches for autoimmune diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3000136066,"Background Coinfections of HIV patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are mayor public health problems, contributing to the emerging burden of HIV-associated hepatic mortality. Coinfection rates vary geographically, depending on various factors such as predominant transmission modes, HBV vaccination rates, and prevalence of HBV and HCV in the general population. In South America, the epidemiology of coinfections is uncertain, since systematic studies are scarce. Our study aimed to analyze rates of HBV and HCV infection in people living with HIV attending centers of the public and private health system in Chile. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study including a public university hospital and a private health center in Santiago, Metropolitan Region in Chile. Serum samples were used to determine serological markers of hepatitis B (HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc total, HBeAg, anti-HBe) and anti-HCV. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from medical records. Results 399 patients were included (353 from public, 46 from private health center). Most (92.8%) were male, with a median age of 38.3 years; 99.4% acquired HIV through sexual contact (75.0% MSM); 25.7% had AIDS and 90.4% were on ART. In 78.9%, viral loads were <40 cps/mL; the median CD4 cell count was 468 cells/mm3. According to their serological status, 37.6% of patients were HBV naïve (susceptible), 6.5% were vaccinated, 43.6% had resolved HBV infection, and 5.8% were chronically infected. The rate of vaccination was 4.5% in the public and 21.7% in the private system. HCV coinfection was found in 1.0% of all patients. Conclusion HBV coinfection rate was within the range of other South American countries, but lower than in non-industrialized regions in Asia and Africa. A low percentage of patients were HBV vaccinated, especially within the public system. HCV coinfection rate was very low, most probably due to the rareness of injecting drug use."
https://openalex.org/W2999319999,"There was an explosion in the amount of commercially available DNA in sequence repositories over the last decade. The number of such plasmids increased from 12,000 to over 300,000 among three of the largest repositories: iGEM, Addgene, and DNASU. A challenge in biodesign remains how to use these and other repository-based sequences effectively, correctly, and seamlessly. This work describes an approach to plasmid design where a plasmid is specified as simply a DNA sequence or list of features. The proposed software then finds the most cost-effective combination of synthetic and PCR-prepared repository fragments to build the plasmid via Gibson assembly®. It finds existing DNA sequences in both user-specified and public DNA databases: iGEM, Addgene, and DNASU. Such a software application is introduced and characterized against all post-2005 iGEM composite parts and all Addgene vectors submitted in 2018 and found to reduce costs by 34% versus a purely synthetic plasmid design approach. The described software will improve current plasmid assembly workflows by shortening design times, improving build quality, and reducing costs."
https://openalex.org/W3000289799,"Ultrasensitive detection of heavy metal ions in available water around us is a great challenge for scientists since long time. We developed an optical technique that combines Rayleigh scattering of UV light (365 nm) and post-sample fluorescence detection from colloidal silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) having a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 420 nm. The efficacy of the technique is tested by the detection of several model toxic ions, including mercury, lead, and methylmercury in aqueous media. The light scattering from the Hg-included/inflated Ag NPs at 395 nm was observed to saturate the light sensor even with ppm-order concentrations of Hg ions in the water sample. However, the pollutant is not detected at lower concentrations at this wavelength. Instead, the fluorescence of a high-pass filter (cut-off at 400 nm) at 520 nm is applied to detect pollutant concentrations of up to several hundreds of ppm in the water sample. We also detected lead and methylmercury as model pollutants in aqueous media and validated the efficacy of our strategy. Finally, we report the development of a working prototype based on the strategy developed for efficient detection of pollutants in drinking/agricultural water."
https://openalex.org/W2999629664,"Participants in the Ultimatum Game will often reject unfair resource allocations at personal cost, reflecting a trade-off between financial gain and maintenance of social standing. Although this rejection behavior is linked to executive control, the exact role of cognitive regulation in relation to status cues is unclear. We propose that the salience of status cues affects how cognitive regulation resolves the conflict between financial gain and social status considerations. Situations that tax executive control by limiting available cognitive resources should increase acceptance rates for unfair offers, particularly when the conflict between economic self-interest and social reputation is high. Here, participants rated their own subjective social status, and then either mentally counted (Load) or ignored (No Load) simultaneously-presented tones while playing two rounds of the Ultimatum Game with an online (sham) ""Proposer"" of either high or low social status. A logistic regression revealed an interaction of Proposer status with cognitive load. Compared to the No Load group, the Load group showed higher acceptance rates for unfair offers from the high-status Proposer. In contrast, cognitive load did not influence acceptance rates for unfair offers from the low-status Proposer. Additionally, Proposer status interacted with the relative social distance between participant and Proposer. Participants close in social distance to the high-status Proposer were more likely to accept the unfair offer than those farther in social distance, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for offers from the low-status Proposer. Although rejection of unfair offers in the Ultimatum Game has previously been conceptualized as an intuitive response, these results instead suggest it reflects a deliberative strategy, dependent on cognitive resources, to prioritize social standing over short-term financial gain. This study reveals the dynamic interplay of cognitive resources and status concerns within this paradigm, providing new insights into when and why people reject inequitable divisions of resources."
https://openalex.org/W2999785545,"Periodontitis has been associated with diabetes and poor health. While clear associations have been identified for the diabetes-oral health link, less is known about the implications of poor oral health status for incident complications of diabetes. This study investigated the risk of diabetes complications associated with self-reported ""poor to fair"" and ""good to excellent"" oral health among diabetics living in Ontario, Canada.This was a cohort study of diabetics who took part in the Canadian Community Health Survey (2003 and 2007-08). Self-reported oral health was linked to electronic health records held at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Participants aged 40 years and over, who self-reported oral health status in linked databases were included (N = 5,183). Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the risk of diabetes complications. Participants who did not experience any complications were censored. Models were adjusted for age and sex, followed by social characteristics and behavioural factors. The population attributable risk of diabetes complications was calculated using fully adjusted hazard ratios.Diabetes complications differed by self-reported oral health; 35% of the total sample experienced a complication and 34% of those reporting ""good to excellent"" oral health (n = 4090) experienced a complication in comparison to 38% of those with ""fair to poor"" oral health (n = 1093). For those reporting ""poor to fair"" oral health, the hazard of a diabetes complication was 30% greater (HR 1.29; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.61) than those reporting ""good to excellent"" oral health. The population level risk of complications attributable to oral health was 5.2% (95% CI: 0.67, 8.74).Our findings indicate that reporting ""poor to fair"" oral health status may be attributed to health complications among diabetics, after adjusting for a wide range of confounders. This has important public health implications for diabetics in Ontario, Canada."
https://openalex.org/W3000287565,"Serum markers that differentiate between tuberculous and non-tuberculous pneumonia would be clinically useful. However, few serum markers have been investigated for their association with either disease. In this study, serum levels of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 9 (MMP-1 and MMP-9, respectively), and periostin were compared between 40 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and 28 non-tuberculous pneumonia (non-PTB) patients. Diagnostic performance was assessed by analysis of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and classification trees. Serum IFN-γ and MMP-1 levels were significantly higher and serum MMP-9 levels significantly lower in PTB than in non-PTB patients (p < 0.001, p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was observed in serum periostin levels between groups. ROC curve analysis could not determine the appropriate cut-off value with high sensitivity and specificity; therefore, a classification tree method was applied. This method identified patients with limited infiltration into three groups with statistical significance (p = 0.01), and those with MMP-1 levels < 0.01 ng/mL and periostin levels ≥ 118.8 ng/mL included only non-PTB patients (95% confidence interval 0.0–41.0). Patients with extensive infiltration were also divided into three groups with statistical significance (p < 0.001), and those with MMP-9 levels < 3.009 ng/mL included only PTB patients (95% confidence interval 76.8–100.0). In conclusion, the novel classification tree developed using MMP-1, MMP-9, and periostin data distinguished PTB from non-PTB patients. Further studies are needed to validate our cut-off values and the overall clinical usefulness of these markers."
https://openalex.org/W3000289054,"Smoking is known as a powerful predictor of pathological coronary atherosclerosis. Thoracic aortic calcification (TAC), an alternative marker for pathological atherosclerosis, has also been shown to be associated unfavorable cardiovascular outcomes. We aimed to investigate the dose-response relationship between cigarette use and calcification burden in subjects free from clinical symptoms. Among 3109 patients enrolled in this analysis, we categorized study participants according to smoking exposure pattern as: non-smokers, ex-smokers and current smokers. Smoking dose (cigarette/day), duration (years) and pack-years were semi-quantified as smoking dose exposure variables. Thoracic aortic calcification burden (including TAC score, plaque volume and plaque density) were determined and related to smoking dose and pattern information. TAC burdens (including TAC score, plaque volume and density) were highest in current smoker compared to non-smoker group, with ex-smoker showing TAC burdens in-between (all ANOVA p<0.05). Linear regression models consistently demonstrated that TAC burdens as continuous variables were independently higher in a dose-dependent manner with smoking exposure, particularly in high-dose (> 10 cigarettes/day) and the long-duration (> 3 years) smokers, even after adjusting for baseline demographic differences (all p<0.05). By logistic regression, subjects who never smoke consistently demonstrated reduced risk of TAC existence (adjusted OR: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.48-0.86], P = 0.003) in contrary to those current smokers (adjusted OR: 1.47 [95% CI: 1.10-1.89], P = 0.009). A dose-response relationship between active cigarette use and TAC burden was observed, with those who never exposed to smoking or quitted demonstrating partial protective effects. Our data provided imaging-based evidence about the potential deleterious biological hazards of long-term and high-dose cigarette consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2998831927,"To better understand factors contributing to underutilization of laboratory services for health care delivery in sub-Saharan Africa, we conducted a study in Senegalese Antenatal Care clinics (ANC) and laboratories to determine the extent of underutilization, contributing factors, and bottlenecks in the cascade of care from first ANC visit, test uptake, to availability of test results and appropriate clinical management.At 16 health facilities, pregnant women attending for their first ANC visit were consecutively recruited and information was prospectively collected on the request, execution, results and clinical management of seven nationally recommended laboratory screening tests for normal pregnancy: hemoglobin concentration (Hb), syphilis serology, HIV serology, determination of proteinuria (PU), determination of blood group and Rhesus factor, Emmel test to detect sickle cell disease, and glycaemia. Health facility staff were interviewed on human resource capacity, management of the ANC and the laboratory, and availability and use of guidelines.Of 1246 ANC attendants, 400 (32%) had complete results. Completeness varied between facilities from 0-99%. In multilevel logistic regression analysis of women nested in facilities, complete uptake was lower if women started ANC later in pregnancy; very low in rural ANC attendants who ever delivered compared to urban primigravidae (OR 0.064; 95%CI 0.00-0.52); and higher if the facility routinely recommended all seven tests. In the cascade from test request to clinical management, the most frequent bottleneck was non-execution of requested tests, while unavailability of results for executed test was uncommon (<2%). Overall, of 525 abnormal test results 97(18%) had a record of adequate clinical management.Our study illustrates challenges to test uptake even when laboratory testing capacity is in place, with large differences between facilities, and underscores the importance of management, policy, and the importance of considering local context in order to improve service delivery to expectant mothers."
https://openalex.org/W2999549494,"This study develops an information-input interface in which a visual stimulus targeted by a user's eye gaze is identified based on the pupillary light reflex to periodic luminance modulations of the object. Experiment 1 examines how pupil size changes in response to periodic luminance modulation of visual stimuli, and the results are used to develop an algorithm for information input. Experiment 2a examines the effectiveness of interfaces with two objects. The results demonstrate that 98% accurate identification of the gaze targeted object is possible if the luminance modulation frequencies of two objects differ by at least 0.12 Hz. Experiment 2b examines the accuracy of a gaze directed information input method based on a keyboard configuration with twelve responses. The results reveal that keyboard input is possible with an average accuracy of 85% for luminance modulation frequencies from 0.75 to 2.75 Hz. The proposed pupillometry based information-input interface offers several advantages, such as low burden on users, minimal invasiveness, no need for training or experience, high theoretical validity, and no need for calibration. Thus, the pupillometry method presented herein has advantages for practical use without requiring the eye's position to be calibrated. Additionally, this method has a potential for the design of interfaces that allow patients with severely limited motor function to communicate with others."
