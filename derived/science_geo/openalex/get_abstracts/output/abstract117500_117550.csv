These neurons express two types of sodium current, which differ in their inactivation kinetics and sensitivity to tetrodotoxin. Here, we report the cloning of the α-subunit of a novel, voltage-gated sodium channel (PN3) from rat DRG. Functional expression in Xenopus oocytes showed that PN3 is a voltage-gated sodium channel with a depolarized activation potential, slow inactivation kinetics, and resistance to high concentrations of tetrodotoxin. In situ hybridization to rat DRG indicated that PN3 is expressed primarily in small sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system.

Voltage-gated sodium channels play a fundamental role in the regulation of neuronal excitability. In addition to differences in primary structure and kinetic properties(1.Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these channels can be distinguished pharmacologically on the basis of their relative sensitivity to the neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin (TTX)( 1The abbreviations used are: TTXtetrodotoxinDRGdorsal root ganglionPCRpolymerase chain reactionRTreverse transcriptionSCNβ1sodium channel β1-subunithhumanrrat.)(2.White J.A.

Two types of sodium currents are expressed by sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), a fast inactivating TTX-sensitive current and a slow inactivating, TTX-resistant current that appears to be expressed by a high proportion of the small afferent neurons(3.Kostyuk P.G.

Of the large and small neurons of the DRG, the latter is of primary importance in the processing of nociceptive information within the somatosensory system(9.Coderre T.J. Katz J. Vaccarino A.L.

In order to define the molecular basis of sodium channel conductance in sensory neurons, we have attempted to identify and clone novel sodium channel α-subunits. As described here, this work has led to the isolation and functional expression of PN3, a novel voltage-gated, TTX-resistant sodium channel expressed predominantly by small sensory neurons within the peripheral nervous system. tetrodotoxin dorsal root ganglion polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription sodium channel β1-subunit human rat. EcoRI-adapted cDNA was prepared from normal adult male Sprague-Dawley rat DRG poly(A)+ RNA using the SuperScript Choice System (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA (>4 kilobases) was selected by sucrose gradient fractionation (11.Kieffer B.L. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) ligated into the Zap Express vector (Stratagene) and packaged with the Gigapack II XL lambda packaging extract (Stratagene). Phage (3.5 × 105) were screened by filter hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe (bases 4637-5868 of rBIIa)(12.Auld V.J. Goldin A.L. Krafte D.S. Marshall J. Dunn J.M. Catterall W.A. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Dunn R.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 449-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Filters were hybridized in 50% formamide, 5 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 50 mM sodium phosphate at 42°C and washed in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50°C. Positive clones were excised in vivo into pBK-CMV using the ExAssist/XLOLR system (Stratagene). Southern blots of EcoRI-digested plasmids were hybridized with a 32P-labeled DNA probe representing a novel domain IV segment amplified from DRG RNA by PCR with degenerate oligonucleotide primers. Southern filters were hybridized in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42°C and were washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. A cDNA clone, 7.3, containing a full-length insert, was identified and sequenced on both strands. In addition, several other PN3 clones were partially sequenced. Sequence analyses were done using the Gap, BestFit, PileUp, and Distances programs of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.). For oocyte expression analysis, the PN3 cDNA was excised from the vector and, after blunting the ends, subcloned into pBSTA. Tissues were isolated from anesthetized, normal adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and were immediately frozen at −80°C. RNA was isolated from tissue samples using RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc.). Random-primed cDNA was reverse-transcribed from 500 ng of RNA from each tissue. PCR primers targeted the 3′-untranslated region of PN3 and defined a 410-base pair amplicon. Thermal cycler parameters were: 30 s/94°C, 30 s/57°C, 1 min/72°C (24 cycles); 30 s/94°C, 30 s/57°C, 5 min/72°C (1 cycle). A positive control (1 ng of pBK-CMV/PN3) and a no-template control were also included. cDNA from each tissue was also PCR amplified using primers specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (13.Tso J.Y. Sun X.-H. Kao T.-H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar) to demonstrate template viability. PN3 PCR amplicons from nodose ganglia and sciatic nerve were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Oligonucleotide probe sequences were synthesized from the unique 3′-untranslated region of PN3 (sense and antisense probes were complementary to each other). Normal rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde; L4-L5 DRG were removed, postfixed in the same solution, and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose. Frozen sections (10 μm) were cut and hybridized overnight at 39°C in a solution containing 35S-ATP-labeled oligonucleotides (specific activity, 5 × 107-1 × 108 cpm/μg), 50% formamide, 4 × SSC, 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 × Denhardt's solution. Sections were washed over a period of 6 h in 2 ×-0.1 × SSC containing 0.1%β-mercaptoethanol, dehydrated in a series of ethanols (50-100%) containing 0.3 M ammonium acetate, and apposed to sheet film (Amersham Bmax) or dipped in liquid emulsion (Amersham LM-1) and then developed for 2 and 5 weeks, respectively. The cell area of neurons (hybridized and non-hybridized) with a distinct nucleolus was measured from sections through the lumbar ganglia with the aid of a Macintosh Quadra 840 using the public domain NIH Image Program (W. Rasband, NIH). Capped cRNA was prepared from the linearized plasmid using a T7 in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, mMessage mMachine) and injected into stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes (14.Goldin A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) using a Nanojector (Drummond). After 2.5 days at 20°C, oocytes were impaled with agarose-cushion electrodes (0.3-0.8 megaohm) (15.Schreibmayer W. Lester H.A. Dascal N. Pflügers Arch. 1994; 426: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and voltage-clamped with a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) in TEV (two-electrode voltage clamp) mode. Stimulation and recording were controlled by a computer running pClamp (Axon Instruments). Oocytes were perfused with a solution containing (in mM): 81 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, 20 Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5). The data in Fig. 5A were collected using the Geneclamp hardware leak subtraction, filtered at 5 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter, and sampled at 50 kHz. For the experiment in Fig. 5C, the oocytes were depolarized from −100 mV to +20 mV for approximately 10 ms at 0.1 Hz; P/-4 leak subtraction was used(16.Bezanilla F. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). There was a slow “rundown” of the current with time, and a correction was made for the resulting sloping baseline. Varying concentrations of TTX (Sigma) in bath solution were perfused over the oocyte, and the current amplitude was allowed to attain steady state before the effect was recorded. To identify novel sodium channel α-subunits from the peripheral nervous system, we used degenerate oligonucleotide-primed RT-PCR analysis of RNA from rat DRG and homology cloning from a rat DRG cDNA library. PCR fragments from domain I and interdomain I-II were cloned and sequenced. The sequences matched those of clones 7.3 and 17.2 that were isolated from the rat DRG cDNA library by homology cloning. Clone 7.3 (PN3, peripheral nerve sodium channel 3) was sequenced entirely. Several other full-length and partial clones for PN3 were isolated. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PN3 cDNA identified a 5868-base open reading frame, coding for a 1956-amino acid protein. In common with other sodium channels, there is an ATG 5 base pairs upstream of the genuine ATG. The deduced amino acid sequence of PN3 (Fig. 1) exhibited the primary structural features of an α-subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel. PN3 contains four homologous domains (I-IV), each consisting of six putative α-helical transmembrane segments (S1-S6). The positively charged residues in the voltage sensor (S4 segments) and the inactivation gate between IIIS6 and IVS1 are highly conserved in PN3; sites for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and N-linked glycosylation shown to exist in other sodium channels (1.Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are also present in PN3. In PN3, however, there are two unique consensus sites for cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites, one in domain II between S3 and S4 and another in the interdomain II-III (Fig. 1). Modulation of rBIIa channel function by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A has been demonstrated(1.Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18.Murphy B.J. Rossie S. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the unique cAMP-dependent protein kinase A consensus sites in PN3 in vitro and in vivo remains to be demonstrated. In addition, there is an insertion of an additional Gln between Pro583 and Ala584 in several partial clones. The significance of the glutamine insertion has not been determined. Fig. 2A shows an amino acid homology comparison of PN3 with other cloned rat sodium channels. The higher sequence homology between PN3 and the TTX-insensitive cardiac channel and their slow inactivation kinetics (discussed below) suggest that they belong to a unique subfamily of sodium channels. Indeed, the Distance paradigm of the GCG program classifies PN3 and the cardiac sodium channel as a subfamily of sodium channels (Fig. 2A). In addition to PN3, partial clones for the following known sodium channels were isolated: rBI, rBIII, glial channel(19.Gautron S. Dos Santos G. Pinto-Henrique D. Koulakoff A. Gros F. Berwald-Netter Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7272-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and a rat ortholog of the human and mouse atypical sodium channels(20.George Jr., A.L. Knittle T.J. Tamkun M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4893-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21.Felipe A. Knittle T.J. Doyle K.L. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30125-30131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A β1-subunit was also cloned from the rat DRG by PCR. The rat DRG β1-subunit and rat brain sodium channel β1-subunit (rSCNβ1) have identical amino acid sequences. Human sodium channel β1-subunit (hSCNβ1) and rSCNβ1 (22.Isom L.L. De Jongh K.S. Patton D.E. Reber B.F. Offord J. Charbonneau H. Walsh K. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Science. 1992; 256: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) are 96% identical. Northern blot analysis using the RT-PCR fragments and the 3′-untranslated region of clone 7.3 as probes showed that PN3 is encoded by a 7.5-kilobase transcript (data not shown). This band was absent in both brain and spinal cord. Analysis of RNA from selected rat tissues by RT-PCR (Fig. 2B) suggests that PN3 mRNA expression was limited to DRG, nodose ganglia, and to a lesser extent, sciatic nerve of the peripheral nervous system (35 cycles of PCR). No signal was present in the sciatic nerve after 25 cycles of amplification. PN3 mRNA was not detected in brain, spinal cord, superior cervical ganglia, heart, or skeletal muscle after 35 cycles of amplification. Additional RT-PCR analyses of DRG mRNA have detected other sodium channels including rBI(23.Noda M. Ikeda T. Kayano T. Suzuki H. Takeshima H. Kurasaki M. Takahashi H. Numa S.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3231-3242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and other novel sodium channel α-subunits (data not shown). In situ hybridization using PN3-specific oligonucleotide probes showed that PN3 mRNA was expressed predominantly by small neurons in rat DRG (Fig. 3). Approximately 76% of the small cell population (400-1000 μm2) and 33% of the large cell population (1400-2000 μm2) were hybridized with probes for PN3 (Fig. 4). Recently, Akopian and Wood (28.Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21264-21270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) isolated a partial cDNA clone, G7, from a rat DRG cDNA library with homology to known sodium channels and specific expression in subsets of sensory neurons. Whether PN3 and G7 are the same gene is unknown at present.Figure 4:Frequency distribution histogram of somal areas from sections through lumbar DRG. The number of neurons hybridized with PN3 is shown by filled bars (n = 246). The number of non-hybridized neurons is shown by hatched bars (n = 215).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes injected with PN3 cRNA indicated that expression of PN3 produced an inward current with slow inactivation kinetics (Fig. 5A). This current was voltage-dependent (Fig. 5B) and is carried by sodium ions; reduction of extracellular sodium ion concentration (by substituting N-methyl-D-glucamine) from 91 to 50 and 21 mM resulted in hyperpolarizing shifts in the reversal potential from +43 mV to +12 mV and −22 mV, respectively. Examination of the current-voltage relationship for PN3 (Fig. 5B) reveals a strikingly depolarized activation potential. In this expression system, PN3 exhibits little or no activation at −10 mV, whereas most cloned sodium channels begin to activate between −60 and −30 mV(29.Cribbs L. Satin J. Fozzard H.A. Rogart R.B. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30.Patton D.E. Goldin A.L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31.Trimmer J.S.

Neuron. 1989; 3: 33-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The currents produced by injection of PN3 cRNA had slow inactivation kinetics (Fig. 5A). rBIIa, rBIII, and rSkM1 sodium channels also produce currents with slow inactivation kinetics when injected into Xenopus oocytes; coexpression of the β1-subunit greatly accelerates the inactivation kinetics of these channels(22.Isom L.L. De Jongh K.S. Patton D.E. Reber B.F. Offord J. Charbonneau H. Walsh K. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Science. 1992; 256: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 32.Cannon S.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17649-17655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, coinjection of 1.3 ng of human sodium channel β1-subunit (hSCNβ1) (36.McClatchey A.L. Cannon S.C. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Gusella J.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) cRNA, which is homologous to the rat brain and DRG SCNβ1, with PN3 cRNA did not accelerate the inactivation kinetics (data not shown). In contrast, coexpression of this quantity of hSCNβ1 cRNA with rSkM1 cRNA was sufficient to accelerate the inactivation kinetics of rSkM1 maximally. Therefore, PN3 may possess inherently slow kinetics. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the PN3 sodium current is highly resistant to TTX (IC50≥ 100 μM) (Fig. 5C). The TTX-sensitive brain and skeletal muscle sodium channels are blocked by nanomolar TTX concentrations, whereas the TTX-insensitive cardiac sodium channels are blocked by micromolar TTX concentrations(2.White J.A. Alonso A. Kay A.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In rat heart sodium channel 1 (rH1), Cys374 is a critical determinant of TTX insensitivity (37.Backx P.H. Yue D.T. Lawrence J.H. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Science. 1992; 257: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 38.Chen L.-Q. Chahine M. Kallen R.G. Barch R.L. Horn R.

Science. 1992; 256: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar); in the TTX-sensitive rBI, rBII, rBIII, and rSkM1, the corresponding residue is an aromatic amino acid, either Phe or Tyr, the aromatic ring of which facilitates the binding of TTX to the protein. In PN3, this position is occupied by a Ser residue (Ser356), which may explain the unique response to TTX. Site-directed mutagenesis of this residue to Phe/Tyr or Cys will determine whether this amino acid residue is solely responsible for TTX resistance. TTX-resistant sodium currents have been implicated in peripheral and central neuronal sensitization mediated by the C-fibers of small neurons following peripheral tissue damage and nerve injury. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of PN3 suggest that it contributes to the TTX-resistant sodium currents in small neurons of DRG. PN3 may, therefore, play a role in the the sensory function and dysfunction that is characteristic of pathophysiological pain processing. In addition, we suggest that PN3 may conduct TTX-resistant sodium currents in other sensory ganglia of the peripheral nervous system such as nodose ganglia(40.Ikeda S.R. Schofield G.G. Weight F.F. J. Neurophysiol. 1986; 55: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We thank C. Yee, P. Zuppan, and C. Bach for sequence analysis and oligonucleotide synthesis. L. Hedley and G.

https://openalex.org/W2001963326,"Interactions between transcription factors are an important means of regulating gene transcription. The present study describes the mutual repression of two transcription factors, the RelA(p65) subunit of NF-κB and the progesterone receptor (PR). This trans-repression is shown to occur independent of PR isoform, reporter construct, or cell type used. Together with the demonstration of an interaction between PR and RelA in vitro, these findings suggest that the mutual repression is due to a direct interaction between these proteins. Furthermore, activation of NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor-α also results in repression of PR, while PR is able to repress tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB activity. Since NF-κB-regulating cytokine receptors are expressed in progesterone target tissues, like breast and endometrium, the mutual repression of PR and RelA could play an important role in a wide variety of physiological processes in these tissues, including maintenance of pregnancy, immunosuppression, and tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2058382351,"The reuptake of glutamate in neurons and astrocytes terminates excitatory signals and prevents the persistence of excitotoxic levels of glutamate in the synaptic cleft. This process is inhibited by oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we show that another biological oxidant, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), formed by combination of superoxide (O2-) and nitric oxide (NO), potently inhibits glutamate uptake by purified or recombinant high affinity glutamate transporters reconstituted in liposomes. ONOO- reduces selectively the Vmax of transport; its action is fast (reaching > or = 90% within 20 s), dose-dependent (50% inhibition at 50 microM), persistent upon ONOO- (or by product) removal, and insensitive to the presence of the lipid antioxidant vitamin E in the liposomal membranes. Therefore, it likely depends on direct interaction of ONOO- with the glutamate transporters. Three distinct recombinant glutamate transporters from the rat brain, GLT1, GLAST, and EAAC1, exhibit identical sensitivity to ONOO . H2O2 also inhibits reconstituted transport, and its action matches that of ONOO- on all respects; however, this is observed only with 5-10 mM H202 and after prolonged exposure (10 min) in highly oxygenated buffer. NO, released from NO donors (up to 10 mM), does not modify reconstituted glutamate uptake, although in parallel conditions it promotes cGMP formation in synaptosomal cytosolic fraction. Overall, our results suggest that the glutamate transporters contain conserved sites in their structures conferring vulnerability to ONOO- and other oxidants."
https://openalex.org/W1986335023,"Numerous epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptide binding members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases have been described. While several EGF agonists bind and activate ErbB-1/EGF receptor, neu differentiation factor (NDF) functions as a ligand for ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. However, it is currently unknown which specific subsets of ErbB receptors become activated in response to each of these ligands. The present study addresses this issue using the T47D breast tumor cell line, which expresses moderate levels of all the presently known ErbB receptors. We show that all the EGF agonists, but not NDF, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-1. In contrast, all the EGF-related factors except amphiregulin were able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2. The ability to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-3 varied dramatically among the different EGF-related peptides. While EGF, transforming growth factor (TGF)-α, and amphiregulin only had a moderate effect, NDF dramatically increased the ErbB-3 phosphotyrosine content. Most notably, heparin binding EGF-related growth factor (HB-EGF) and betacellulin (BTC) were more effective than other EGF agonists. Consequently, only NDF, HB-EGF, and BTC significantly stimulated association of phosphatidylinositol kinase activity with ErbB-3. Among the EGF agonists, HB-EGF induced a low level of ErbB-4 tyrosine phosphorylation, while BTC was as efficient as NDF in activating ErbB-4. The BTC activation of ErbB-4 appears to be independent of ErbB-1, as shown by pretreatment of cells with an antibody that inhibits binding of EGF agonists to ErbB-1. As a result of the differential activation of ErbB receptors, most of the EGF-related growth factors had distinguishable biological activities on cultured mammary epithelial cell lines. Numerous epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptide binding members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases have been described.

The BTC activation of ErbB-4 appears to be independent of ErbB-1, as shown by pretreatment of cells with an antibody that inhibits binding of EGF agonists to ErbB-1. As a result of the differential activation of ErbB receptors, most of the EGF-related growth factors had distinguishable biological activities on cultured mammary epithelial cell lines. INTRODUCTIONMany polypeptide growth factors exert their function by binding cell surface receptors with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated residues serve as high affinity binding sites for SH2 or phosphotyrosine binding domain containing proteins and allow for the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways(2.Koch C.A.

Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). RTKs play a fundamental role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. A large number of RTK subclasses has been described, among which the type I/ErbB family of RTKs is of particular interest due to their frequent involvement in human cancer. Four members of this family are currently known: epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor/ErbB-1, ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4(4.Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J.

Med. Bull. 1991; 47: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ErbB-2 in the presence or absence of gene amplification is frequently found in tumors arising at many sites, especially of the breast and ovary where it correlates with poor patient prognosis(9.Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). High levels of ErbB-3 have been described both in breast tumor cell lines (10.Kraus M.H. Fedi P.

In order to fully understand the normal function of ErbB receptors as well as their role in neoplastic transformation it is crucial that their regulation by growth factors be elucidated in detail.Regulation of ErbB receptor activity appears to be very complex since a large number of ErbB ligands have been described. All of these peptides are derived from transmembrane precursors and are cleaved to give rise to the mature, soluble ligands. Depending on their binding specificities, they can be subdivided into two classes. The first group of ligands binds to the EGFR and includes EGF itself, transforming growth factor (TGF) α, amphiregulin (AR), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and betacellulin (BTC)(12.Savage Jr., C.R.

Another family of EGF-related peptides is composed of the neu differentiation factors (NDFs)/heregulins(18.Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S.S. Luo Y. Trail G. Hu S. Silbiger S.M.

Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). There are at least 12 different isoforms arising from a single gene by alternative splicing and depending on the sequence of their EGF-like repeat they are classified as either α or β isoforms(22.Peles E. Yarden Y. Bioassays. 1993; 15: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, despite the large number of NDFs no differences in receptor binding specificities appear to exist: ErbB-3 functions as a low affinity receptor for all NDF isoforms while ErbB-4 serves as a high affinity receptor(23.Tzahar E. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran G. Yi L. Peles E. Lavi S. Chang D. Liu N. Yayon A. Wen D. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25226-25233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).An additional level of complexity in ErbB-mediated signaling has been brought forward by the finding that binding of a specific ligand not only triggers the formation of receptor homodimers, but also heterodimers. For instance, EGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 through formation of ErbB-1/ErbB-2 dimers(24.King C.R. Borrello I. Bellot F. Comoglio P. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25.Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, NDF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2, presumably through formation of ErbB-3/ErbB-2 and ErbB-4/ErbB-2 dimers(21.Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 26.Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M.

Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6496-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). An important consequence of heterodimerization of EGF and NDF receptors with ErbB-2 is a dramatically increased affinity for the respective ligand(26.Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Wada T. Qian X.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). However, heterodimerization may also serve to diversify the nature of the intracellular signal elicited by a specific growth factor. The prototype example supporting this notion is the recent observation that EGF stimulates the association of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase with ErbB-3, presumably through EGFR/ErbB-3 heterodimerization followed by cross-phosphorylation(30.Soltoff S.P.

Thus, the present study was designed as a comparative analysis of all the currently available EGF-related growth factors with respect to activation of ErbB receptors and biological activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSGrowth Factors and AntibodiesRecombinant human EGF and bovine pancreatic insulin were purchased from Sigma, recombinant human TGFα from Saxon Biochemicals, and recombinant human HB-EGF, AR, and BTC from R& Systems. The recombinant human β3 isoform of NDF used for all the experiments described in this paper was a generous gift from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA. The antibodies used in this study were: ErbB-1-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 225(32.Sunada H. Magun B.E. Mendelsohn J. MacLeod C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1989; 321: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).Cell CultureT47D and MDA MB 468 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5 μg/ml insulin. MCF10A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml EGF, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μM dexamethasone. HC11 cells were grown in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml EGF, and 5 μg/ml insulin. Prior to growth factor stimulation cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free medium containing 1 mg/ml fetuin (Sigma) and 10 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma).Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisCells were solubilized in Triton X-100 extraction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM EGTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 nM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium molybdate, 20 μM phenylarsine oxide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 10 min on ice. The lysates were collected, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. For immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of protein (usually 1-2 mg) were incubated with specific antibodies for 2 h on ice. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), washed three times with extraction buffer, and once with TNE (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA). Bound proteins were released by heating 10 min at 95°C in sample buffer. Total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and proteins were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 20% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in TTBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), filters were probed with specific antibodies and proteins visualized with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody using the ECL detection system (Amersham). Filters were stripped in a buffer containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 65°C, washed three times in TTBS, blocked, and reprobed with the indicated antibodies.Assay for ErbB-3-associated PtdIns Kinase ActivityCells were lysed as described above and ErbB-3 was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total protein extract. The immune complexes were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, twice in 0.1 M Tris, pH 6.8, 0.5 M LiCl, once in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and resuspended in 30 μl of a kinase mixture containing 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 μM ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of sonicated PtdIns (Sigma). After 10 min at 30°C the reaction was stopped and extracted by the addition of 0.4 ml of 1 M HCl and 0.8 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:1 (v/v) mixture). The lipid containing organic phase was extracted with 0.32 ml of 1 M HCl, methanol (1:1 (v/v) mixture), dried down in a Speed Vac, redissolved in 20 μl of chloroform, and resolved on thin-layer chromatography plates (Silica Gel 60; Merck) developed in chloroform, methanol, 4 M ammonium hydroxide (9:7:2 (v/v/v) mixture). Radiolabeled spots corresponding to PtdIns phosphate were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Cell Growth AssaysMCF10A cells were plated in triplicate in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 1 mg/ml fetuin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μM dexamethasone) in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml EGF-related growth factors (2 × 103 cells/well/96-well dish). MDA MB 453 cells were plated in triplicate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of 5 nM EGF-related growth factors (104 cells/well/96-well dish). HC11 cells were plated in triplicate in RPMI supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum and either 5 μg/ml insulin or 100 ng/ml EGF in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml EGF-related growth factors (2 × 103 cells/well/96-well dish). Growth was monitored after 3 days (MCF10A and HC11 cells) or 4 days (MDA MB 453 cells) using the Cell Titer AQTM kit (Promega).Soft Agar Growth AssayT47D cells (3 × 103) were plated in duplicate in 6-cm dishes in 6 ml of culture medium supplemented with 0.35% Noble agar (Difco) overlaying a 0.7% agar layer. For growth stimulation, 1 nM EGF-related growth factor was added to the medium. The cells were incubated for 4 weeks at 37°C, after which colonies were stained by adding 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mg/ml of nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) for 24 h. Colonies larger than 200 μm were counted with an Artek 880 colony counter (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.).RESULTSEGF-related Growth Factors Differentially Induce Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ErbB-1 and ErbB-2The T47D breast tumor cell line has proven to be an invaluable model system for the study of ErbB-mediated signaling, since the cells express moderate levels of all the currently known ErbB receptors(25.Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Beerli R.R. Graus-Porta D. Woods-Cook K. Chen X. Yarden Y. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6496-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). T47D cells were treated with EGF, TGFα, HB-EGF, AR, BTC, or NDF, and ErbB-1 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed for its phosphotyrosine content by Western blotting with a specific antibody (Fig. 1A). All the EGF agonists induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-1. While EGF, TGFα, HB-EGF, and BTC showed similar activities, AR was remarkably less effective. In striking contrast to the EGF agonists, NDF had no effect on ErbB-1 phosphorylation.Previously, NDF and several EGF agonists have been shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2(19.Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel G.V. Vandlen R.L.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2924-2931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, BTC- or HB-EGF-induced phosphorylation has not been reported so far. Thus, we compared all the factors with respect to activation of ErbB-2. With the exception of AR, the EGF agonists, as well as NDF, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 to a similar extent, presumably due to the ability of both EGF- and NDF-receptors to heterodimerize with this receptor (Fig. 1B).EGF-related Growth Factors Differentially Induce Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ErbB-3 and Association with PtdIns Kinase ActivityBoth EGF and NDF have been reported to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-3. However, little is known about activation of ErbB-3 by the various EGF agonists. Thus, T47D cells were stimulated with each of the peptides and ErbB-3 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed for its phosphotyrosine content by Western blotting with a specific antibody (Fig. 2A). Treatment with both NDF and EGF led to an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-3. Compared to NDF, however, EGF only had a very small effect on ErbB-3. This may be due to the relatively low ErbB-1 levels expressed in these cells. In ErbB-1 overexpressing MDA MB 468 cells a much more pronounced effect on ErbB-3 phosphorylation has been observed(31.Kim H.-H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EGF agonists differed significantly in their ability to activate ErbB-3. While TGFα and AR were similar to EGF, HB-EGF and BTC had a much stronger effect on ErbB-3 phosphorylation. This observation is of particular interest since it implies a potential for differential activation of ErbB-3-specific pathways by EGF agonists.Figure 2:Tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-3 and association with PtdIns kinase activity. After 24 h starvation in serum-free medium, T47D cells were treated for 10 min at room temperature with 100 ng/ml of the indicated factors, lysed, and ErbB-3 was immunoprecipitated with antibody C17. A, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with a phosphotyrosine-specific mAb (upper panel). Filters were stripped and reprobed with antibody C17 (lower panel). B, associated PtdIns kinase activity was determined in an immune complex kinase assay using PtdIns as a substrate. Bars show the fold stimulation of PtdIns kinase activity in comparison to untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ErbB-3 is unique among subclass I RTKs due to the presence of several Tyr-X-X-Met motifs in its intracellular domain, the consensus binding site for the p85 subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase(37.Fedi P. Pierce J.H. DiFiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, both EGF and NDF induce the association of PtdIns 3-kinase activity with ErbB-3(30.Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 31.Kim H.-H. Sierke S.L. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24747-24755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the differential effects of EGF agonists on ErbB-3 phosphorylation, we analyzed their ability to induce association of PtdIns-kinase activity with this receptor. T47D cells were stimulated with the various peptides, ErbB-3 was immunoprecipitated, and the associated PtdIns kinase activity was measured in an in vitro kinase assay using PtdIns as a substrate (Fig. 2B). In good correlation with the effects on tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-3, NDF dramatically induced ErbB-3 association of PtdIns kinase activity, while the EGF agonists were generally less active. Significantly, HB-EGF and BTC stimulated PtdIns kinase activity more strongly than the other EGF agonists. Thus, by differentially inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-3, EGF-related growth factors have different abilities to couple to ErbB-3-specific pathways.EGF-related Growth Factors Differentially Induce Tyrosine Phosphorylation of ErbB-4Little is known about the potential interaction of EGF agonists and ErbB-4, another receptor for NDF(21.Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Thus, T47D cells were stimulated with each of the EGF-related peptides, and ErbB-4 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). As shown before(27.Beerli R.R. Graus-Porta D. Woods-Cook K. Chen X. Yarden Y. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6496-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), NDF rapidly induces phosphorylation of ErbB-4 in T47D cells. Among the EGF agonists HB-EGF induced a low level of ErbB-4 phosphorylation, while BTC was found to be as efficient as NDF in activating ErbB-4.Figure 3:A, tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-4. T47D cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free medium and treated for 10 min at room temperature with 100 ng/ml of the indicated factors prior to lysis. ErbB-4 was immunoprecipitated with antibody C18, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with a phosphotyrosine-specific mAb (upper panel). Filter was stripped and reprobed with antibody C18 (lower panel). B, competition of mAb 225 with EGF and BTC. T47D cells were starved for 24 h in serum-free medium and either left untreated or pretreated with 10 μg/ml mAb 225 (+mAb) for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of 1 nM EGF or BTC. ErbB-4 (left panel) and ErbB-1 (right panel) were immunoprecipitated with, respectively, antibody C18 or a 1:1 mixture of mAb EGFR1 and mAb 528, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)There are at least two possibilities for the strong BTC-induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-4. Either BTC directly binds and activates ErbB-4, or BTC binds to ErbB-1 and induces the formation of ErbB-1/ErbB-4 heterodimers followed by cross-phosphorylation. To test these possibilities, T47D cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml mAb 225, which competes with EGF for binding to ErbB-1, prior to stimulation with EGF or BTC (Fig. 3B). While mAb 225 readily abolished both EGF- and BTC-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-1, it only partially inhibited BTC-induced phosphorylation of ErbB-4. Thus, BTC appears to directly bind and activate ErbB-4, although the availability of ErbB-1 seems to enhance the activation of ErbB-4, presumably through ErbB-1/ErbB-4 heterodimerization.EGF-related Growth Factors Differ in Their Biological ActivityTo characterize the biological properties of the various EGF-related growth factors, each of the peptides was tested for its ability to stimulate the growth of mammary epithelial cell lines (Fig. 4). First, the factors were tested for their ability to replace EGF in the growth medium of MCF10A cells, a spontaneously immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line that requires EGF for growth (38.Soule H.D. Maloney T.M. Wolman S.R. Peterson Jr., W.D. Brenz R. McGrath C.M. Russo J. Pauley R.J. Jones R.F. Brooks S.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6075-6086PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Under serum-free conditions, most of the EGF agonists had similar activities and caused approximately a 3-fold stimulation in growth. In contrast, NDF and AR stimulated growth significantly less, showing that the activation of ErbB-1 is important for a mitogenic effect on MCF10A cells. Second, the factors were tested on MDA MB 453 cells, a human breast tumor cell line that does not contain detectable amounts of ErbB-1 (39.Yarden Y. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3179-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Most of the EGF agonists had only a marginal effect on the growth of these cells. In contrast, NDF was significantly more active, obviously due to the fact that NDF signaling does not involve ErbB-1. Most importantly, BTC was comparable to NDF, in agreement with the ability of BTC to elicit ErbB-1-independent signaling (see Fig. 3B).Figure 4:Effect of EGF-related peptides on the growth of cultured mammary epithelial cells. A, growth stimulation of MCF10A cells. B, growth stimulation of MDA MB 453 cells. Cells were plated in triplicate in the presence or absence of the indicated factors and growth was monitored after 3 days (MCF10A cells) or 4 days (MDA MB 453 cells) using the Cell Titer AQTM kit (Promega).

https://openalex.org/W2036969473,"A minor class of introns with noncanonical splice (AT-AC) and branch site sequences exists in metazoan protein coding genes. We have established a HeLa cell in vitro system that accurately splices a pre-mRNA substrate containing such an intron from the human P120 gene. Splicing occurs via a lariat intermediate whose branch site A residue is predicted to bulge from a duplex formed with the low abundance U12 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which we confirm by psoralen cross-linking. Native gel electrophoresis reveals that U11, U12, and U5 snRNPs assemble onto the P120 pre-mRNA to form splicing complexes. Inhibition of P120 splicing by 2'-O-methyl oligonucleotides complementary to U12 or U5 demonstrates that U12 and U5 snRNPs perform essential roles in the AT-AC spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W2090863366,"Mitochondria undergo at least two types of structural alteration in response to various physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. One type is nonreversible and is associated with mitochondrial lysis. The second is reversible and appears to be associated with calcium-mediated activation of a specific inner mitochondrial membrane channel. The mechanisms underlying the induction of this second alteration, termed a mitochondrial permeability transition (PT), have been the subject of a great deal of recent research. Using rat liver mitochondria, our data demonstrate that calcium-mediated PT induction can be affected by the lipid peroxidation byproducts 4-hydroxynonenal and 4-hydroxyhexenal (HHE). 4-Hydroxynonenal appears inactive at concentrations <1 uM but displays both stimulatory and inhibitory effects as part of a biphasic dose response between approximately 1 and 200 uM. In contrast, HHE consistently enhances calcium-mediated induction of the PT, even at femtomolar concentrations. The exquisite specificity and sensitivity of HHE led to further studies to examine the nature of this induction. Studies showing that HHE-mediated induction could be prevented by cyclosporin A confirmed PT involvement. Further studies showed that induction was dependent on both calcium and electron transport chain function. Pretreatment of the HHE with glutathione also prevented PT induction, but simultaneous addition of the thiol reagents dithiothreitol or glutathione, which often prevents PT induction, was ineffective, attesting to the effectiveness of HHE as an inducer.

Exposure to oxidants or to phosphate, especially in the presence of calcium, has long been known to lead to mitochondrial swelling and damage. In the past 15 years it has become increasingly appreciated that this swelling is due to the induction of a specific proteinaceous channel now termed the permeability transition pore (PTP)( 1The abbreviations used are: PTPpermeability transition poret-BuOOHtert-butyl hydroperoxidePTpermeability transitionGSHglutathioneHNE4-hydroxynonenalHHE4-hydroxyhexenal.)(1.Gunter T.E.

In vitro, induction of the channel may be observed in the presence of calcium. The addition of phosphate (3.Rigobello M.P. Toninello A. Siliprandi D. Bindoli A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1276-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or oxidants such as tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) (4.Masaki N. Kyle M.E. Serroni A. Faber J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) greatly enhances the rate of induction. Induction may also be achieved by respiratory uncouplers(5.Takeyama N. Matsuo N. Tanaka T. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), some fatty acids (e.g. palmitoyl CoA(2.Bernardi P. Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. J Bioenerg.

Channel opening by some inducers may also be inhibited by other compounds such as magnesium (believed to compete with calcium)(10.Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Brierley G.P. Pfeiffer D.R. Arch. Biochem.

Acta. 1994; 1187: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and effectors of lipid structure also appear to play roles in PT induction (e.g. phospholipase A2) (20.Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and its prevention (e.g. trifluroperazine)(21.Pereira R.S. Bertocchi A.P.F. Vercesi A.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1795-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The potential lethality of PT induction, coupled with the apparent roles of phosphate, calcium, and oxidants in this induction, have suggested to many that activation of this pore may play roles in ischemia reperfusion injury(1.Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Duchen M.R. McGuiness O. Brown L.A. Crompton M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1790-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Initial support for this concept comes from long standing observations of swollen mitochondria in ischemia reperfusion injury and the observation that free radical scavengers and anti-oxidants exhibit partial protective activity. More recently, direct support has come from studies of the protective activity of PT inhibitors in models of anoxia, hypoxia, and ischemia reperfusion injury(1.Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Duchen M.R. McGuiness O. Brown L.A. Crompton M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1790-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that the synergistic effects of oxidants and calcium on PT induction appear to represent a major way in which free radicals and uncontrolled calcium can damage cellular homeostasis. Another major way in which calcium and oxidative stress impact on cellular physiology is through the induction of lipid peroxidation reactions. Lipid peroxidation, via its chain reaction processes, serves to propagate and amplify oxidant-mediated damage. Lipid peroxidation reactions have been associated with acute pathologic occurrences (e.g. ischemia reperfusion injury) (23.Kramer J.H. Misik V. Weglicki W.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 723: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and chronic pathological conditions (e.g. diabetes) (24.Sukalski K.A. Pinto K.A. Berntson J.L. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 14: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), ( 2Kristal, B. S., Koopmans, S. J., Jackson, C. T., Ikeno, Y., Park, B.-J., and Yu, B. P., submitted for publication.) as well as the aging process(26.Choe M. Jackson C. Yu B.P. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 18: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is currently believed that the byproducts of lipid peroxidation reactions, including malondialdehyde and the hydroxyalkenals, mediate many of the detrimental effects associated with lipid peroxidation reactions(27.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar). Although malondialdehyde has been considered as the major deleterious lipid peroxidation byproduct, much of the current work on the toxicity of lipid peroxidation byproducts focuses on the more reactive hydroxyalkenals, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) and 4-hydroxyhexenal (HHE)(27.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar). These products are readily generated in vivo following application of various biological/biochemical insults. These compounds are highly reactive to amino acids, especially those containing thiol groups, and highly toxic to many cellular systems, such as mitochondria(27.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar). For example, HNE has been shown to impair both mitochondrial transcription (28.Kristal B.S. Chen J.J. Yu B.P. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 16: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and respiration(29.Dianzani M.U. McBrian D.C.H. Slater T.F. Free Radicals, Lipid Peroxidation, and Cancer. Academic Press, London1982: 129-158Google Scholar), decrease mitochondrial membrane fluidity(30.Chen J.J. Yu B.P. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1994; 17: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and impair function of the adenine nucleotide translocase(31.Chen J.J. Bertrand H. Yu B.P. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1995; 19: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consideration of the biochemical natures of HNE in conjunction with the current body of understanding of PT inducers (e.g. thiol cross-linkers, calcium, a possible role for lipid peroxidation in irreversible induction), led to the hypothesis that the hydroxyalkenals would be potent inducers of the PT. This possibility was further supported by the observed ability of HNE to inhibit the adenine nucleotide translocator, a protein whose functional status is believed to interact with the PT. In the current work, we therefore directly tested the prediction that hydroxyalkenals would induce the PT. The HHE and HNE used in these experiments were generous gifts of Dr. Herman Esterbauer. Both chemicals are now commercially obtainable from Bioxytech. Male Fischer 344 rats were obtained from Charles River at 4 weeks of age and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Animals were allowed ad libitum access to water and a soy protein-based semi-synthetic diet (21% RP101 soy protein isolate, 15% sucrose, 3% solka floc, 3.33% RP vitamin mix, 5% mineral mix with reduced sodium, 0.35% DL-methionine, 0.33% choline chloride, 6% corn oil, and 45.99% dextrin, (Purina)). Animals used in the studies described were between 4 and 10 months of age. Following decapitation, livers were rapidly dissected out and placed in ice-cold buffer 1 (250 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 100 uM EDTA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 500 uM EGTA. Livers were homogenized with a motor-driven teflon pestle. Following homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. This and all other centrifugation steps used a Beckman JA-20 rotor and Beckman J21B centrifuge. Supernatants were removed and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were washed twice in buffer 1 supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma A-6003) and respun at 10,000 rpm. Following the final wash, mitochondria were resuspended in buffer 1. Protein was estimated spectrophotometrically as described previously(32.Layne E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 447-451Crossref Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). Changes in the status of the PT pore were assessed spectrophotometrically as described previously(4.Masaki N. Kyle M.E. Serroni A. Faber J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 1 mg of mitochondria was resuspended at room temperature in 1 ml of 215 mM mannitol, 71 mM sucrose, 3 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5 mM succinate (3.Rigobello M.P. Toninello A. Siliprandi D. Bindoli A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1276-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Induction of a permeability transition was monitored following exposure to calcium alone or in combination with other inducers as described in specific figure legends. Changes in absorbances were followed until they dropped and restabilized, and the time at which one-half of the absorbance was lost was determined. Unless otherwise noted, samples were processed as follows. 1) Calcium was added to the buffer, and the solution was mixed. 2) 1 mg of mitochondria was added, and the solution was mixed. 3) The remaining solutions were added, and the solution was mixed. To maximize clarity throughout this paper, all traces presented within a given figure are redrawn to start at exactly the same point, so absolute absorbances are not given. Adjustments for a given figure were always less than 3%. Absorbances for 1 mg/ml mitochondria were generally in the range of 1.25-1.5, and the total loss of absorbance was approximately 40-50% of the initial value. All traces within a given figure were done on the same day with identical mitochondria. The ability of lipid peroxidation byproducts such as HHE and HNE to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition was directly addressed through comparison with well characterized systems. As most systems that induce the PT require calcium, we tested HHE and HNE in the presence of 25 uM Ca2+. As can be seen in Fig. 1, 180 uM HNE appears to reduce the induction time of the PT compared with induction by calcium alone, but a decreased rate of propagation leads to an overall slowing of the time required for half-maximal induction. In contrast, 60 uM HHE speeds up calcium-mediated induction by about 30%. We addressed of each of these products separately. HNE dose response analysis (Fig. 2) revealed that HHE displays a complex biphasic dose response curve. It is inactive at concentrations <1 uM. In the preparation shown in Fig. 2, we noted that 1.8 uM and 180 uM HNE enhanced calcium-mediated PT induction, whereas 18 uM and 60 uM inhibited it. The general form of this dose response appears consistent, but the absolute values at which the noted effects occur is variable (e.g. compare Fig. 1, trace a, with Fig. 2A, trace A). The remainder of Fig. 2 shows that the effect of HNE is mediated through effects on the rate of propagation. Fig. 2B shows how the slope (rate of propagation) relative to that obtained with calcium alone is modulated by dose. Fig. 2C shows how the time of half-maximal induction relative to that obtained with calcium alone is modulated by dose. Fig. 2D shows the tight inverse relationship between these two parameters. The regression analysis in Fig. 2E shows that the inverse of the slope is indeed a strong predictor of the overall time to half-maximal induction. In the dose response curve shown in Fig. 2, lag also appears correlated, but note that Fig. 1(trace B) shows that this is not always the case. Thus, although alterations in lag may be associated with overall response to HNE, they appear to play minor roles in its effects on PT induction kinetics. HHE dose response analysis (Fig. 3) revealed that HHE enhanced calcium-mediated PT induction at concentrations as low as 60 fM. Enhancement was regularly seen at femtomolar concentrations (n = 9 of 9). Attomolar concentrations were also occasionally seen to increase PT induction (not shown), but this result was not consistent. Analysis of HHE-mediated PT induction showed two distinct phases. At concentrations in the micromolar range, HHE consistently reduces lag time (Fig. 1, trace c, and Fig. 3, trace B) but has a variable effect on slope (compare Fig. 1, trace c, with Fig. 3, trace B), which leads to a marked variability in the time until maximal induction. This variability at high doses makes determination of a true EC50 for HHE both impractical and uninformative. In contrast to both this data and the data on HNE presented above, submicromolar concentrations of HHE act predominantly or exclusively by decreasing lag time (Fig. 3, B and C). HHE-mediated induction was next compared with other effectors of PTP opening. As shown in Fig. 4A, HHE-mediated effects on PT induction by nanomolar and femtomolar HHE, although consistently more rapid than calcium alone, are slower than induction by either 2 mM inorganic phosphate or 75 uMt-BuOOH. As pointed out above, however, induction by higher HHE concentrations (e.g. 60 uM) is extremely sample-specific and may be nearly as rapid as phosphate normally is (e.g.Fig. 3, trace B) or roughly the level of enhancement seen with t-BuOOH (e.g.Fig. 1 and 4B). Note the different effects on lag and slope in Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:B, suggesting that the effects of micromolar concentrations of HHE may also differ from sample to sample. We next began characterization of the HHE-mediated response through the use of compounds known to slow or prevent PT induction. To confirm that response to HHE represented PT induction, we examined the ability to block induction with cyclosporin A, a well characterized specific inhibitor of the PT. As shown in Fig. 5, cyclosporin prevents the loss of absorbance induced by HHE. To further evaluate factors involved in HHE-mediated PT induction, we examined the ability of several compounds to affect HHE-mediated induction. EGTA, myxothiazol, and antimycin A (data not shown, identical to myxothiazol) were all able to inhibit PT induction by Ca2+ and HHE (Fig. 5), but glutathione (Fig. 6) and dithiothreitol (2 mM, data not shown, identical to glutathione) were not. In contrast, pretreatment of HHE with glutathione did prevent induction (Fig. 6). Because of the variability observed with micromolar concentrations of HHE, EGTA, cyclosporin, and myxothiazol were tested against 60 nM HHE. Because these inhibitors were effective against this concentration, lower HHE doses were not tested. In the glutathione experiment, the use of femtomolar HHE allowed us to determine if GSH could block induction by even the lowest effective HHE dose, which, as seen in Fig. 6, it could not.Figure 6:Preincubation with glutathione inactivates HHE.

In trace c, the glutathione and HHE were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature (6 μl of 10 pM HHE, 10 μl of 10 mM GSH, 10 μl of the buffer used in the PT assay) prior to addition to the reaction.

Although much early work focused on the damage done to the lipids themselves, more recent work has also addressed the roles that the byproducts of these peroxidation reactions play in ongoing cellular function and dysfunction. Because of its prevalence and its ability to cross-link biomolecules, malondialdehyde was the focus of initial studies on the effects of lipid peroxide byproducts. As understanding of the field grew, however, more emphasis began to be placed on the hydroxyalkenals, especially HNE (27.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar). HNE is produced in during lipid peroxidation reactions from the breakdown of linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and 15-hydroperoxyarachidonic acid(27.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar, 33.Esterbauer H. McBrian D.C.H. Slater T.F. Free Radicals, Lipid Peroxidation, and Cancer.

Acta. 1986; 876: 154-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar); it is far more reactive than malondialdehyde, often impairing biological function in the low micromolar range. HHE is similarly reactive and can be formed through both lipid peroxidation (by the degradation of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, e.g. 22:6) and through nonperoxidative mechanisms, such as the metabolism of the alkaloid senecionine(27.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar, 35.Segall H.J. Wilson D.W. Dallas J.L. Haddon W.F.

Interestingly, the mechanism underlying senecionine poisoning has been shown to be HHE-mediated disruption in calcium homeostasis (38.Griffin D.S. Segall H.J. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1987; 2: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note the comparison between our observations and the commonly held belief that the chemical similarity between HHE and HNE means that they are also biologically similar. HHE, which is only recently beginning to be studied in detail, enhanced calcium-mediated induction of the PT at femtomolar concentrations. Higher levels of HHE (micromolar) can give extremely rapid induction, but for reasons we have been unable to determine, effects are highly variable. These observations are especially interesting given the known effect of HHE to disrupt calcium homeostasis(38.Griffin D.S. Segall H.J. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1987; 2: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast to HHE, the effects of HNE are extremely dose-dependent, thus indicating a reactivity distinct from that evidenced by HHE. For example, HNE can slow induction at ~10-100 uM, whereas no inhibitory effects have ever been observed with HHE at micromolar concentrations (data not shown). Notably, Richter and Meier (25.Richter C.H. Meier P.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have shown that concentrations of HNE that we find slow PT induction (~10-100 uM) can prevent pro-oxidant-induced calcium release from mitochondria, apparently by interfering with pyridine nucleotide hydrolysis(25.Richter C.H. Meier P.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar), which can favor PT induction(1.Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the PT were used to further probe the mitochondrial alterations induced by HHE and calcium. The cyclosporin A studies confirmed that we were indeed studying induction of PT, as opposed to nonspecific swelling. The EGTA studies demonstrate that calcium is required for PT induction by HHE, as it is for most other inducers. The studies with respiratory inhibitors (e.g. myxothiazol, antimycin A) confirmed the role of respiration in PT induction (probably through a free radical-mediated mechanism). The failure of both GSH and dithiothreitol to protect when added just prior to addition of HHE was unexpected, as the major known chemical activity of HHE is as a thiol-oxidant, and both GSH and dithiothreitol have been previously demonstrated to prevent PT induction by blocking oxidation of a critical thiol. Coupled with the consideration that neither endogenous mitochondrial GSH (millimolar concentrations versus femtomolar HHE concentrations) nor exogenous GSH added prior to HHE prevented PT induction by HHE, these data show that HHE is far more reactive with the channel than with GSH and that GSH is thus relatively inactive in protecting mitochondria from HHE-mediated damage. Evidence has suggested that the hydroxyalkenals such as HHE and HNE have approximately equal reactivity to GSH and have approximately a 2-min half-life in the mitochondria. This relatively long half-life in the presence of vast excess of GSH is due to the relatively low frequency of the form of GSH (GS-) (27.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar) that reacts with the hydroxyalkenals. Thus, if the channel is commonly in a state in which it can react with HHE, the critical reactions may be far less unlikely than they seem at first. Studies showing that 15-min pretreatments of HHE with GSH prior to the addition of this reaction mixture to the mitochondria provided evidence supporting this kinetic explanation. Our data further understanding of the observations of Richter and Meier (25.Richter C.H. Meier P.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) on HNE-mediated effects on mitochondria and help to explain the earlier observations on the toxicity of HHE and senecionine(38.Griffin D.S. Segall H.J. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1987; 2: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Beyond this, the observations that HHE and HNE can alter the effects of calcium on PTP function raises the question of the implication of this interaction between calcium and hydroxyalkenals in vivo. Certainly HHE can reach femtomolar levels in vivo, and higher concentrations of both HHE and HNE may exist locally, especially during times of increased oxidative stress. Because ischemia reperfusion injury is associated with both calcium influx and free radical-generated lipid peroxidation, our data provide a potentially testable mechanism for the putative role of PT induction in ischemia reperfusion injury(1.Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Duchen M.R. McGuiness O. Brown L.A. Crompton M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1790-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This interaction may become even more important should cellular and mitochondrial defenses become compromised due to progressive age or disease status. In conclusion, it is important to note that the potent effects of HHE on the PT suggest that the time has come to focus more attention on the lipids that comprise the inner mitochondrial membrane and how these lipids may play roles in PT induction. Free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation and the associated production of both HHE and HNE may affect PT function during aging, chronic disease, and acute events such as ischemia reperfusion injury. Membranes may also affect PT function in other ways, because alterations in membrane structure and function, such as those that occur with age, may alter calcium balance or membrane potential, both of which can affect the PT. We gratefully acknowledge the generous gift of HHE and HNE from Dr. Herman Esterbauer and the assistance of Dr. Hae-Young Chung."

One signal transduction pathway that leads to induction of target gene expression after cytokine stimulation is the recently described Janus kinase (Jak)-STAT pathway (for reviews, see (2.Darnell J.E.

Stat3 can be activated by a number of different cytokines and growth factors, including the IL-6 family of cytokines (IL-6, IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor) that share the common gp130 receptor subunit, and epidermal growth factor (1.Kishimoto T.

We report here the construction of a dominant negative form of Stat3 capable of competitively interfering with wild type Stat3 activation by IL-6. This dominant negative mutation will prove to be a useful tool to investigate the role of Stat3 in cytokine-dependent induction of target genes. Human Stat3 cDNA was inserted in the expression vector pTL1, a derivative of pSG5(13.Green S. Issemann I. Scheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The Stat3 mutation Y705F was constructed by a two-step polymerase chain reaction procedure changing the TAC codon for tyrosine, at position 705, to TTC encoding phenylalanine. FLAG-tagged versions of Stat3 and Y705F were constructed by polymerase chain reaction, with an 8-amino acid epitope (FLAG) inserted just prior to the stop codon (encoding the amino acids DYKDDDDK). Expression of the FLAG recombinant proteins was verified by Western analysis with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. All constructions were verified by DNA sequencing. The HepG2 cell line was obtained from the ATCC. The cells were cultured in Eagle's basal medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). 6 × 106 cells were seeded/10-cm dish, for transfections or immunopreciptations. IL-6 was purchased from R & D Systems. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the calcium phosphate procedure (as described in (14.Durand B. Saunders M. Leroy P. Leid M. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar)). IIP6-tk-cSPAP was used for gene reporter studies. A control reporter plasmid RSV-lactamase was cotransfected in the gene reporter studies. The lactamase gene product is secreted into the medium along with secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SPAP). When indicated in the text Stat3, Y705F, or empty (pTL1) expression vectors were cotransfected with the reporters. SPAP and lactamase were quantitated by colorimetric assays(15.Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes, and the next day were trypsinized and replated on 96 wells (30,000 cells/well). After 24 or 48 h, IL-6 was added at varying doses for indicated periods of time prior to SPAP and lactamase assays. SPAP activity was normalized against lactamase activity as a control for interwell variation. Individual time points were performed in quadruplicate. HepG2 cells were transfected with DNA (30 μg/6 × 106 cells) using the calcium phosphate procedure. After 14-16 h of incubation with the precipitate, cells were maintained on standard medium for 2 days to allow the expression of Stat3, Y705F, Stat3-FLAG, or Y705F-FLAG. Following this incubation cells were incubated overnight on RPMI 1640 containing 1% fetal bovine serum. The Hep G2 cells were then treated for 10 min with the latter medium in the presence or absence of IL-6 (25 ng/ml), washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before being lysed for 20 min in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol, 1 mM Na3 VO4, 1 mM NaF, 1 μg/ml AEBSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). After a pretreatment of the cell lysate with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma), the lysate was incubated with the antibody M2 against the FLAG-tagged protein, which was precipitated using protein G-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer, without Nonidet P-40 and glycerol, then boiled for 3 min in sample loading buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 5%β-mercaptoethanol). Precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% gel), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the antibody indicated in the figures. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Kodak SIS. On the basis of alignment with Stat1, in which tyrosine 701 is the residue phosphorylated upon IFN-γ treatment(8.Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.-J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 16.Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E.

A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), we have identified tyrosine 705 of Stat3 as the likely site of phosphorylation by Jak kinases during signal transduction. To confirm the importance of tyrosine 705 in Stat3 activation, a mutation was made in which this tyrosine has been replaced by a phenylalanine (Fig. 1, mutation Y705F). We then determined whether Stat3 and Y705F were tyrosine-phosphorylated in HepG2 cells after IL-6 treatment. For this experiment expression plasmids were constructed containing the Stat3 or Y705F cDNA tagged at the carboxyl-terminal site with the FLAG epitope (Fig. 1). HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for Stat3-FLAG or Y705F-FLAG, and subsequently treated with IL-6. The M2 monoclonal antibody directed against the FLAG epitope, was used to specifically immunoprecipitate the expressed FLAG-tagged protein, but not endogenous STATs. As illustrated in Fig. 2A (M2 anti-FLAG immunoblot), Stat3-FLAG- and Y705F-FLAG-tagged proteins are expressed and immunoprecipitated. In HepG2 cells transfected with Stat3-FLAG, treatment with IL-6 resulted in a clear stimulation of the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (Fig. 2A, anti-Tyr(P) immunoblot). In untreated HepG2 cells transfected with Stat3-FLAG a very weak tyrosine phosphorylated Stat3-FLAG is observed, indicating that a low amount of phosphorylated Stat3 is constitutively present. In cells transfected with Y705F-FLAG and treated with IL-6, only a low level of tyrosine phosphorylated protein is observed. This suggests that tyrosine at position 705 of Stat3 is phosphorylated in response to IL-6 treatment. However, the faint band revealed by the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in the IL-6-treated Y705F lane in Fig. 2A suggests that Y705F-FLAG might be weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated at an additional site following IL-6 treatment (either within the FLAG epitope, DYKDDDDK, that includes a tyrosine residue, or on an endogenous tyrosine).Figure 2:Phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 of Stat3 upon activation by IL-6. A, Hep G2 cells, transiently transfected with 8 μg of pTL1 or expression vectors containing FLAG-tagged Stat3 or Y705F cDNA, were incubated 10 min in the presence or absence of IL-6 (25 ng/ml). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody directed against FLAG (M2) and after SDS-PAGE and blotting, probed with the antibody to FLAG or an anti- phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr) monoclonal antibody (4G10). B, Hep G2 cells transiently transfected with 1 μg of the expression vector containing FLAG-tagged Stat3 cDNA, together with 10 μg of pTL1 or the Y705F expression vector. Conditions were as described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next investigated whether Y705F could inhibit phosphorylation of endogenous Stat3 following IL-6 stimulation of transfected HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors containing the cDNA for Stat3-FLAG in combination with a 10-fold excess of either the empty expression vector pTL1 or Y705F (without the FLAG epitope). Using M2 anti-FLAG antibody, wild type Stat3-FLAG is precipitated (see Fig. 2B, M2 anti-FLAG immunoblot). In the cotransfection with pTL1, Stat3 is still phosphorylated upon IL-6 treatment (Fig. 2B, anti-Tyr(P) immunoblot). However, in the co-transfection with Y705F, although Stat3-FLAG is expressed normally, only a weak band is observed in IL-6 treated cells in the anti-Tyr(P) immunoblot, showing that phosphorylation of Stat3-FLAG is inhibited. This indicates that the Stat3 mutant Y705F acts in a dominant negative manner to inhibit Stat3 phosphorylation and activation. Transfection of increasing amounts of Y705F gives a dose-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of Stat3 (data not shown), suggesting that Y705F competitively inhibits Stat3 phosphorylation by competing for the binding to the phosphotyrosine(s) on gp130. An IL-6-responsive reporter construct, IIP6-tk-cSPAP containing six copies of the palindromic sequence TTCCGGGAA placed upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter and the SPAP cDNA sequence was used to study IL-6 signaling via Stat3. The palindromic sequence chosen has been reported as the sequence with the highest affinity in binding of phosphorylated Stat3(18.Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies using an oligonucleotide containing this palindromic sequence together with nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells treated or not with IL-6 reveal the presence of three complexes that correspond to Stat3 homodimers, Stat1-Stat3 heterodimers and Stat1 homodimers (data not shown, and (18.Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar)). Co-transfection of the IIP6-tk-cSPAP reporter construct and the Stat3 expression vector in HepG2 cells resulted in a more elevated promoter activation by IL-6, measured in a SPAP assay, as compared to HepG2 cells co-transfected with the empty expression vector pTL1 and the SPAP reporter construct (Fig. 3A, IL-6 dose response, 9.4-fold versus 5.6-fold maximal induction; and 3B, time course after IL-6 addition). When Y705F was transfected in HepG2 cells a strong inhibition is observed in the IL-6-induced promoter activation (Fig. 3A, activation is reduced to ∼ 2-fold). These results indicate that phosphorylation of tyrosine at position 705 of STAT3 is essential in IL-6 signaling and that the mutant Y705F reduces the signal transduction via endogenous Stat3. Transfection of HepG2 cells with increasing amounts of Y705F expression vector inhibits IL-6 induction of the SPAP reporter in a dose-dependent manner, indicating competition of Y705F with endogenous Stat3 upon IL-6 activation (Fig. 4). Stat3 and Y705F have no effect on expression of a cotransfected control reporter construct RSV-lactamase whose expression remains unaltered by IL-6 treatment (data not shown).Figure 4:Y705F competitively inhibits IL-6 induction of IIP6-tk-SPAP reporter. Hep G2 cells were transiently transfected with 8 μg of IIP6-tk-cSPAP, 4 μg of RSV-lactamase, and with increasing amounts of Y705F expression vector as indicated. Total amounts of expression vector was standardized throughout by adding various quantities of pTL1. SPAP activity is calculated as in Fig. 3A, normalized for lactamase secretion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mutation of tyrosine 705 to phenylalanine in Stat3 leads to reduced levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated mutant protein following IL-6 treatment, indicating that this residue is a site of phosphorylation. This is in accordance with the alignment with other members of the Stat family, in particular Stat1, where tyrosine 701, and Stat2 where tyrosine 690 are phosphorylated, respectively, following cytokine treatment(16.Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 17.Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Moreover, immunoprecipitation studies show that Y705F inhibits phosphorylation of Stat3-FLAG following IL-6 treatment in cotransfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, the Y705F mutation of Stat3 acts in a dominant negative manner to inhibit IL-6 activation of the IIP6-tk-cSPAP reporter construct in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). Y705F competitively inhibits IL-6 signal transduction as measured in our transcriptional assay (Fig. 4) and in immunoprecipitation experiments measuring Stat3-FLAG tyrosine phosphorylation in cotransfections with increasing quantities of Y705F (data not shown). This demonstrates that tyrosine 705 in Stat3 is critical for activation by IL-6. Recent studies indicate that Stat1 and Stat6 bind directly to tyrosine phosphopeptides derived from the IFN-γ receptor and the IL-4 receptor, respectively(20.Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 20.Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that inactive cytoplasmic STATs are recruited to the activated receptor by docking of the STAT SH2 domain to selected receptor tyrosine phosphopeptides, where they are in turn phosphorylated on a single tyrosine by Jak kinases(10.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulous G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 19.Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H.

Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Stat1 is phosphorylated on Tyr-701, and mutation of this tyrosine to phenylalanine inactivates this mutant Stat1(16.Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Domain swapping experiments between Stat1 and Stat2 demonstrate that the SH2 domain is critical for selective recruitment to activated receptor chains(21.Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine dictate substrate recruitment via specificity of SH2 domain/tyrosine phosphopeptide interactions ((22.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar); see (23.Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) for review). Recent work indicates that Stat3 can be activated via receptor tyrosine phosphopeptides with glutamine in the +3 position (Y∗XXQ) (10.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulous G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The glutamine at +3 is believed to play a critical role in Stat3 recruitment since its alteration to alanine prevents Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in chimeric receptor constructs(10.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell J.E. Yancopoulous G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this target sequence differs from the internal Stat3 tyrosine phosphopeptide sequence that may be used in back-to-back Stat3 homodimer formation (Y∗LKT). This finding also applies to Stat1α, which is recruited by a Y∗DKPH motif on the IFN-γ receptor(19.Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Shreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 24.Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Shreiber R.D.

The tyrosine 705 residue that is phosphorylated during Stat3 activation is thought to be immediately distal to the carboxy boundary of the SH2 domain, a distance too short to allow an intramolecular interaction between the SH2 domain and the phosphotyrosine residue(25.Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This close proximity suggests that phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 may lead to a conformational change of the Stat3 SH2 domain that alters its selectivity for tyrosine phosphopeptides. After tyrosine phosphorylation, such an induced conformational change might encourage dissociation of Stat3 from the receptor and enhance formation of Stat dimers by altering selectivity from Y∗XXQ, the receptor sites that are likely to be bound by non-activated Stat3, to Y∗LKT the tyrosine phosphopeptide present in Stat3 that allows STAT dimerization by interacting with the SH2 domain of the dimeric partner. Such an alteration in the selectivity of an SH2 domain for target tyrosine phosphopeptides has been reported for the tyrosine kinase p56lck(26.Joung I. Kim T. Stolz L.A. Payne G. Winkler D.G. Walsh C.T. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5778-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our current model for the dominant negative action of Y705F (Fig. 5) implies that the mutated Stat3 can still bind to IL-6-activated gp130 tyrosine phosphopeptides, since the SH2 domain is unaltered, but the critical residue at position 705 can no longer be tyrosine-phosphorylated by Jak kinases. Consequently, Y705F may block recruitment of Stat3 to receptor phosphopeptide docking sites and hence prevent activation of wild type Stat3. If phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 of Stat3 leads to a conformational change of its SH2 domain leading to reduced affinity for the receptor docking sites, then the Stat3 mutant Y705F/receptor complex may have a longer half-life than its wild type homolog. It cannot be excluded that Y705F may also form heterodimers with activated Stat3 through a single SH2/phosphotyrosine interaction (Fig. 5B, bottom). Such putative heterodimers with weakened molecular interactions may be susceptible to phosphatase deactivation or may simply be unable to bind DNA target sequences. By altering the tyrosine residue that is phosphorylated in the different STATs, it should be possible to create similar dominant negative mutations, that will allow investigation of the role of individual STATs in the cellular responses to various cytokines and growth factors.

The predominant species trapped in all cases are the corresponding sulfur-centered radicals, i.e. glutathionyl radical (GS) from glutathione (GSH), N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine thiyl radical (S-NAP) from N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (NAP) and sulfate anion radical (SO3-) from sulfite. These radicals consume molecular oxygen forming either peroxyl or superoxide anion radicals. GS, S-NAP, and (SO3-)-derived radicals react with ammonium formate to form the carbon dioxide anion radical (CO2-). Further support of spin adduct assignments and radical reactions are obtained from photolysis of S-nitrosoglutathione and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine. We conclude that the direct reaction of peroxynitrite with thiols and sulfate forms thiyl and sulfate anion radicals, respectively, by a hydroxyl radical-independent mechanism. Pathological implications of thiyl radical formation and subsequent oxyradical-mediated chain reactions are discussed. Oxygen activation by thiyl radicals formed during peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation of glutathione may limit the effectiveness of GSH against peroxynitrite-mediated toxicity in cellular systems."

These amino acids contain the highly conserved BH1 and BH2 regions, which have been used to define the Bcl-2 family. We show that both Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS are able to regulate cell survival in a dose-dependent fashion. Bcl-xL is able to increase the cellular apoptotic threshold and is able to form stable complexes with Bax both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, Bcl-xS can effectively inhibit the protective effects of Bcl-xL following growth factor withdrawal and chemotherapeutic drug treatment. However, compared with Bax, Bcl-xS binds to Bcl-xL weakly when assessed by in vitro binding assays. Coimmunoprecipitation from mammalian cells demonstrates that Bcl-xS does not show an observable ability to form heterodimers with other Bcl-2 family members.

The crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of EBNA1 bound to an 18 bp binding site was solved at 2.4 A resolution. EBNA1 comprises two domains, a flanking and a core domain. The flanking domain, which includes a helix that projects into the major groove and an extended chain that travels along the minor groove, makes all of the sequence-determining contacts with the DNA. The core domain, which is structurally homologous to the complete DNA-binding domain of the bovine papilloma virus E2 protein, makes no direct contacts with the DNA bases.

Since many receptors that mediate IRS protein phosphorylation do not contain NPXY motifs, the IH1PH domain or some other mechanism must be involved. To search more precisely for other regions of interaction between IRS proteins and the insulin receptor, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid system. Our results reveal an novel region in IRS-2 that interacts with the kinase domain of the insulin receptor. Unlike the IH2PTB domain, this region interacts with tyrosine residues in the regulatory loop of the kinase domain. Since an equivalent region was not detected in IRS-1, our results reveal an important difference between IRS-1 and IRS-2, which may play a role in signaling specificity between those two IRS proteins. For the two-hybrid system we used the yeast strain L40 (MAT a, trp1, leu2, his3, LYS2::lex A-HIS3, URA3::lex A-lacZ) and the yeast expression plasmid pBTM116. Both reagents were provided by A.

Individual transformants were patched on SC medium lacking tryptophan and leucine and then replicated on Whatman No. 40 paper laid on an SC medium without tryptophan and leucine. After 24 h, a β-galactosidase assay was performed by a color filter assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) as described(26.Bartel P.L. Chien C. Sternglanz R. Fields S.

A blue coloration of colonies reflects the occurrence of interaction with the two hybrid proteins. Cotransformants were also tested for histidine prototrophy after replica plating on SC medium without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. For quantitative studies of the β-galactosidase activity, a liquid culture assay using o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside as a substrate was carried out according to (26.Bartel P.L. Chien C.

Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Since the transcription of these genes is under the control of LexA upstream-activating sequences, when the two fused proteins associate, the reporter genes are transcribed, and cotransformants produce β-galactosidase and grow in the absence of histidine. To establish whether IRS-2 binds to IRβ and IGF-IRβ, we tested the interaction of LDBD-IRβ and LDBD-IGF-IRβ with GAD-IRS-2. When IRS-2 was expressed with IRβ or IGF-IRβ, cotransformants were blue in the X-Gal assay (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when IRS-2 was coexpressed with lamin, the X-Gal assay was negative as expected. Moreover, no interaction occurred between GAD-IRS-2 and the kinase inactive receptor in which lysine 1018 was replaced with alanine (LDBD-IRβ K1018A) (Fig. 1B). Thus, we conclude that, like for IRS-1(17.O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the interaction between IR and IRS-2 is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. The insulin receptor undergoes tyrosine autophosphorylation in three regions including the regulatory loop (Tyr-1146, Tyr-1150, Tyr-1151), the COOH terminus (Tyr-1316, Tyr-1322), and the juxtamembrane region (Tyr-960)(28.White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the requirement for tyrosines 1316 and 1322 of the IR in this association by coexpressing GAD-IRS-2 with LDBD-IRβΔ1316-1322. This mutant IR lacked two autophosphorylation sites (tyrosines 1316 and 1322) because of the deletion of residues 1316-1322. This mutant receptor interacted normally with IRS-2, demonstrating that the tyrosine residues 1316 and 1322 do not mediate the interaction (Fig. 1B). Since tyrosine 960 of the juxtamembrane domain of IR has been shown to correspond to a key binding site of IRS-1, we investigated whether this residue plays a role in the association with IRS-2. To do this we coexpressed GAD-IRS-2 with LDBD-IRβ Y960F, which contains phenylalanine in place of tyrosine 960. Surprisingly, this mutation did not prevent the interaction between the LDBD-IRβ and the full-length GAD-IRS-2 (Fig. 1B). These results were unexpected because the IH2PTB domain in IRS-2 binds specifically to phosphorylated NPXY motifs with similar characteristics to those of IRS-1. ( 2L. Yenush and M. F. White, manuscript in preparation.) Furthermore, a GAD hybrid protein containing the IH2PTB domain from IRS-2 and IRS-1 interacted specifically with the wild type IR but not with the IR Y960F (Fig. 2). Thus, the interaction of IRS-2 and IRS-1 with the IR involves their PTB domain, and both IRS proteins seem to interact in a similar fashion. However, our finding that IRS-2 still associates with IR Y960F suggests that another domain of IRS-2 interacts with a cytoplasmic region of the IR, which is different from the juxtamembrane NPXY motif. To identify the novel interaction domain of IRS-2, which is distinct from the PTB, we examined the interaction between LDBD-IRβ and different deletion hybrids of IRS-2. Unlike IRS-1, the COOH terminus of IRS-2 (residues 591-1325) interacts specifically with the IR. The existence of such a domain may explain why intact IRS-2 bound to the Y960F IR construct. To localize more precisely this newly identified domain, we made two constructs: (i) GAD-IRS-2 containing amino acids 591-786; and (ii) GAD-IRS-2 containing amino acids 994-1324. The region of IRS-2 comprising amino acids 591-786 interacted with the IR, whereas the construct containing amino acids 994-1324 did not (Fig. 3B). Moreover, co-expression of these IRS-2 regions with LDBD-IRβ K1018A and LDBD-IRβ Y960F revealed that the interaction of IRS-2591-786 required IR kinase activity but was independent of Tyr-960 (Fig. 3B). Finally, we investigated whether the interaction between IRS-2591-786 and IR required the autophosphorylation sites in the regulatory loop (Tyr-1146, −1150, and −1151). To address this issue we replaced individually Tyr-1146, Tyr-1150, and Tyr-1151 with phenylalanine in the LDBD-IRβ. We found a reduced but persistent interaction of the different constructs of IR with GAD-IRS-1 and GAD-IRS-2 (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the autophosphorylation sites in the regulatory loop regulated the association of IR with both IRS proteins. These data are similar to our observations made with IRS-1 and the IGF-IR(19.Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23456-23460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Next, we coexpressed the different autophosphorylation tyrosine mutants with the IRS-2591-786 regions (Fig. 3C). Each point mutation completely inhibited the interaction. However, the corresponding region of IRS-1(494-746) did not bind to wild type IR (data not shown). Thus, the tyrosine autophosphorylation sites Tyr-1146, Tyr-1150, and Tyr-1151 in the IR kinase domain play an active role in the regulation of the interaction with IRS-2 by associating directly with IRS-2591-786. To gain insight into the role of the two known IRS-2 domains in the interaction with IR, we coexpressed LDBD-IRβ with GAD-IRS-2, GAD-IH2PTB-(191-350), or GAD-IRS-2-(591-786). We quantitated the interaction by measuring the β-galactosidase activity using a liquid test (Fig. 4A). We found that the level of the β-galactosidase activity, obtained when the native IRS-2 construct is expressed with the IR, was additive to that obtained when the receptor was expressed with the two domains separately. Interestingly, we observed that the IRS-2-(591-786) domain exhibited a 5-fold higher β-galactosidase activity than the PTB domain when coexpressed with the IR. These data suggest that the domain of IRS-2 comprising amino acids 591-786 interacts with the IR in a tighter fashion compared with the IH2PTB domain. Finally, to investigate whether for IRS-2, the PTB domain and the newly identified domain 591-786 are the only two regions through which binding to the insulin receptor takes place, we constructed an IR mutated on both Tyr-1150 and/or Tyr-1151, and on Tyr-960. Co-expression of these mutants with GAD-IRS-2 indicates that the interaction between IR and IRS-2 is entirely lost (Fig. 4B). To verify the expression of IR mutants in yeast, we coexpressed the LDBD-IRβ Y960F/Y1150F and LDBD-IRβ Y960F/Y1150F/Y1151F with the GAD-p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The transformation with p85 can be considered as a positive control because the SH2 domains of p85 interact with the COOH-terminal tyrosines 1316 and 1322 of the IR(29.Tartare-Deckert S. Murdaca J. Sawka-Verhelle D. Holt K.H. Pessin J.E. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137 (in press)Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Taking our results together, we conclude that IRS-2 interacts with the IR with two domains, i.e. the PTB domain and the domain comprising amino acids 591-786. In summary, using the yeast two-hybrid system we have shown that IRS-2 binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated IR and IGF-IR. The analysis of IRS-2 binding to IR shows that IRS-2 associates via its PTB domain to the IRβ-subunit at the level of the NPXY960 motif in the juxtamembrane domain. However, the key observation of our study is that IRS-2 interacts with the IR via a second domain comprising amino acids 591-786, which is different from the PTB domain. This newly identified domain associates with the catalytic domain of IR containing Tyr-1146, Tyr-1150, and Tyr-1151 residues. The IR interaction of IRS-2 through its PTB domain appears to be less tight compared with the interaction through the other IRS-2 domain (Fig. 4A). In addition, the interaction through the PTB domain does not abolish the binding of native IRS-2 to the IR (Fig. 1). Taking these observations together we would like to suggest that the two domains might have different functions. Indeed, the IRS-2 domain comprising amino acids 591-786 would be the primary anchor of IRS-2 to the insulin receptor, while the PTB domain would have a stabilizing action on the interaction with the insulin receptor.

The downstream signaling events mediating Ha-Ras and Gα13 stimulation of NHE1 have not been identified. Ha-Ras and Gα13 regulate two parallel MAP kinase signaling cascades, and these cascades include serine/threonine protein kinases that could potentially modulate exchange activity.Stimulation of one of these cascades, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade, by activated growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases is mediated by the GTPase Ras. GTP-bound Ras recruits an immediate downstream effector, Raf1, to the plasma membrane, where it is activated by an unidentified mechanism(16.Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M.

Although morphological studies suggest that Cdc42 acts upstream of Rac1 and Rac2(41.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar, 42.Kozma R.

Coexpression of a dominant negative Rac1N17 with constitutively activated Cdc42V12 does not inhibit(38.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

The ability of these GTPases to constitutively stimulate NHE1 activity and the correlation of increased exchange activity with transformed phenotypes indicate the importance of determining the mechanisms mediating GTPase regulation of NHE1. In this study, we used dominant interfering alleles of kinases and GTPases to determine the mechanisms by which Ha-Ras and Gα13 activate NHE1. Although Ha-Ras and Gα13 regulate both the ERK and JNK cascades, our results indicate that Ha-Ras stimulates the exchanger through a Raf1- and MEK1-dependent mechanism that is independent of MEKK1. In contrast, Gα13 activates NHE1 through a MEKK1-dependent mechanism that requires Cdc42, but not Rac1. Gα13, but not Ras, also stimulates exchange activity through a Rho-dependent mechanism that is independent of MEKK1.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and TransfectionsChinese hamster lung CCL39 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. 18 h prior to transfections, cells were plated at a density of 0.8 × 10+6 in 60-mm dishes. Cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine method (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1-3 μg of DNA. pcDNA empty vector was used to maintain total transfected DNA constant. 18 h after transfection, cells were reseeded in serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium onto glass coverslips, allowed to adhere, and then maintained for an additional 18-24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium until used for measuring NHE1 activity.Expression PlasmidsHa-RasV12, Gα13QL, Gα13/αz, and D2-dopamine receptor subcloned into pcDNAI were obtained from T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya and H. Bourne and were previously described(13.Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol.

These Raf1 constructs have a 5′-untranslated sequence from the human Raf1 gene and a KT3 epitope tag at their 3′-ends(43.MacNicol A.M. Muslin A.J. Williams L.T.

The kinase-inactive form of mouse MEK, referred to as MEK-Km (K343M point mutation), was subcloned into pcDNA3 at BamHI/EcoRV sites with a BamHI-blunted HindIII fragment. Wild-type MEKK1 and its kinase-inactive form, MEKK1-Km (K432A point mutation), were subcloned into pcDNA3 at EcoRI/XhoI sites. The constitutively activated MEKK1Δ allele contains an N terminus truncation (amino acids 1-352), but retains an intact catalytic domain (amino acids 353-674). The MEKK1Δ construct was made by placing a NcoI-SspI fragment into a SmaI site of pCMV. Both MEKKΔ and MEKK1-Km were C-terminally tagged with a HA epitope. pEXV-MycRac1V12 and pEXV-MycRac1N17 were previously described (44.Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M.

Fluorescence ratios were calibrated with 10 μM nigericin in 105 mM KCl(47.Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Cells were acid-loaded by the application (10 min) and removal of 20 mM NH4Cl (48.Boron W.F. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1976; 67: 91-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Rates of recovery from this acid load (dpHi/dt) were determined by evaluating the derivative of the slope of the pHi tracing at pHi intervals of 0.05. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of separate cell transfections.ImmunoblottingImmunoblot analyses were made from cells prepared for pHi determinations to ensure that samples used for Western blots and pHi determinations had similar levels of protein expression. After the glass coverslips were removed for fluorescence measurements, cell lysates were prepared from the remaining adherent cells. Samples were normalized for protein content, and 25 μg of protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resolved proteins were transferred to nylon-supported nitrocellulose (Alameda Chemicals & Science, Inc.). After nonspecific binding sites were blocked, the filters were incubated with an anti-Myc antibody at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunopositive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.).Microinjection and ImmunofluorescenceCCL39 cells were microinjected with plasmids in the nucleus, incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for ~5 h, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Immunofluorescence procedures using anti-Myc antibodies to visualize injected cells were carried out essentially as described previously(16.Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Cells were also stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) at 0.5 μg/ml.RESULTSRas and Gα13 Use Distinct Kinase Cascades to Stimulate NHE1Both Ras and Gα13 regulate ERK and JNK. To determine whether the kinase cascades leading to ERK and JNK activation mediate stimulation of NHE1, we transiently expressed constitutively active kinases and GTPases and dominant negative kinases in CCL39 fibroblasts. NHE1 activity was determined by monitoring the rate of pHi recovery from an acute acid load induced by 20 mM NH4Cl. We first studied the role of Raf1, an immediate downstream effector of Ras(49.Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Expression of constitutively active v-Raf, RasV12, and α13QL stimulated NHE1 activity (Fig. 1A). The resting pHi of 6.97 ± 0.02 (mean ± S.E.) in vector controls also increased, to 7.18 ± 0.02 with v-Raf, to 7.11 ± 0.02 with RasV12, and to 7.12 ± 0.01 with α13QL (n = four separate transfections). We then cotransfected a kinase-deficient Raf1 (Naf) allele with these GTPases. This dominant interfering kinase specifically blocks activation of endogenous Raf1 activity(43.MacNicol A.M. Muslin A.J. Williams L.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 571-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Naf completely inhibited RasV12-activated exchange activity (Fig. 1A) and decreased RasV12-induced resting pHi to 6.97 ± 0.03 (n = 4). Coexpression of wild-type Raf1 at a 1:1 ratio with Naf rescued the Naf-inhibited activation by RasV12 (Fig. 1A). Naf, however, had no effect on α13QL-stimulated exchange activity (Fig. 1A) or on α13QL-induced resting pHi (7.11 ± 0.03 in the presence of Naf; n = 4). In three separate transfections, coexpression of Naf also failed to inhibit activation of NHE1 by mutationally active GαqRC (data not shown). These findings suggested that Ras, but not Gα13 or Gαq, stimulates NHE1 through a Raf1-dependent mechanism.Although Raf1 may act on several substrates, the MAP kinase kinase proteins MEK1 and MEK2 are its preferred targets(18.Kyriakis J.M. Force T.L. Rapp U.R. Bonventre J.V. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16009-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used a catalytically inactive MEK-Km allele (35.Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) to investigate MEK-dependent activation of NHE1. Coexpression of MEK-Km completely inhibited RasV12 activation of NHE1 (Fig. 1B) and lowered RasV12-induced resting pHi from 7.13 ± 0.02 to 6.97 ± 0.03 (n = 4). Ras therefore activates NHE1 by the same pathway as it activates ERK. MEK-Km, however, had no effect on α13QL-induced NHE1 activity (Fig. 1B) or on resting pHi (data not shown).Ras (29.Derijard B.

The lack of suitable dominant interfering or constitutively active alleles of JNK and its upstream regulator JNK kinase limited our study to the role of MEKK1, an upstream regulator of JNK(36.Yan M.

Expression of a constitutively active carboxyl-terminal truncated MEKK1 (MEKK1Δ) increased NHE1 activity (Fig. 1C) and increased the resting pHi from 7.00 ± 0.02 in vector controls to 7.16 ± 0.04 (n = 3). Coexpression of a kinase-inactive MEKK1-Km with RasV12 had no effect on Ras-stimulated exchange activity (Fig. 1C) or on Ras-induced increases in pHi (7.12 ± 0.02 in the absence and 7.11 ± 0.01 in the presence of MEKK1-Km; n = 4). Coexpression of MEKK1-Km with α13QL, however, completely inhibited G13-stimulated exchange activity (Fig. 1C) and reduced the G13-induced resting pHi from 7.12 ± 0.02 to 7.00 ± 0.03 (n = 5). Gα13, but not Ras, therefore uses a MEKK1-dependent pathway to stimulate NHE1.Members of the Rho Family of GTPases Couple to the Activation of NHE1Recently, two members of the Rho subfamily of GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42, were determined to activate the JNK cascade(38.Coso O.A.

Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). To examine whether these GTPases can regulate NHE1 activity, we transiently expressed the constitutively active alleles Rac1V12, Cdc42V12, and RhoAV14 in CCL39 fibroblasts. In three separate transfections, expression of each constitutively active GTPase resulted in an increase in exchange activity (Fig. 2). Additionally, the resting pHi of 6.98 ± 0.01 in vector controls increased to 7.14 ± 0.02 with Rac1V12, to 7.18 ± 0.04 with Cdc42V12, and to 7.09 ± 0.02 with RhoAV14. Coexpression of MEK-Km had no effect on Rac1V12 or Cdc42V12 stimulation of NHE1 (Fig. 2). Coexpression of MEKK1-Km with these alleles, however, completely inhibited their activation of the exchanger (Fig. 2) and reduced resting pHi to 7.01 ± 0.02 with Rac1V12 and to 7.02 ± 0.03 with Cdc42V12. In contrast, MEKK1-Km failed to reduce increases in either NHE1 activity (Fig. 2) or resting pHi induced by RhoAV14, confirming the specificity of its inhibitory effects on Rac1V12 and Cdc42V12. Hence, the mechanism whereby these small G proteins activate the exchanger is different, as Rac1 and Cdc42, but not RhoA, act through a MEKK1-dependent pathway. The MEKK1-independent effects of both Ras and Rho on NHE1 suggested that"

https://openalex.org/W1991608880,"The mechanism of cytotoxicity of the NO donor 3-morpholino-sydnonimine toward a human ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR) was examined. It was found that the NO-mediated loss of cell viability was dependent on both NO and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Somewhat surprisingly, superoxide (O2) and its reaction product with NO, peroxynitrite (-OONO), did not appear to be directly involved in the observed NO-mediated cytotoxicity against this cancer cell line. The toxicity of NO/H2O2 may be due to the production of a potent oxidant formed via a trace metal-, H2O2-, and NO-dependent process. Because the combination of NO and H2O2 was found to be particularly cytotoxic, the effect of NO on cellular defense mechanisms involving H2O2 degradation was investigated. It was found that NO was able to inhibit catalase activity but had no effect on the activity of the glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx)-glutathione reductase system. It might therefore be expected that cells that utilize primarily the GSHPx-glutathione reductase system for degrading H2O2 would be somewhat resistant to the cytotoxic effects of NO. Consistent with this idea, it was found that ebselen, a compound with GSHPx-like activity, was able to protect cells against NO toxicity. Also, lowering endogenous GSHPx activity via selenium depletion resulted in an increased susceptibility of the target cells to NO-mediated toxicity. Thus, a possible NO/H2O2/metal-mediated mechanism for cellular toxicity is presented as well as a possible explanation for cell resistance/susceptibility to this NO-initiated process.

The cytotoxic actions of activated macrophages against human cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo have been, at least partially, attributed to their ability to generate nitric oxide (NO) ( 1The abbreviations used are: NOnitric oxideGSHglutathioneGSHPxglutathione peroxidaseSNAPS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamineSIN-13-morpholino-sydnonimine.)(for example see Hibbs et al.(1988), Stuehr and Nathan(1989), and Farias-Eisner et al.(1994)). Although the cytotoxic/cytostatic activity of NO is well established, the chemical mechanism by which NO elicits its cytotoxic action is less well understood. NO is capable of degrading certain iron-containing prosthetic groups, which results in an inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, DNA synthesis, and aconitase activity (Hibbs et al., 1988). Along with NO generation, activated macrophages also produce superoxide (O2). The reaction of NO with O2 is extremely rapid (Huie and Padmaja, 1993) and results in the generation of peroxynitrite (-OONO), which is a potent chemical oxidant when in the protonated form (Koppenol et al., 1992). It has been demonstrated that -OONO can be formed from macrophage-derived NO (Ischiropoulus et al., 1992) and is capable of, for example, lipid peroxidation (Radi et al., 1991a), oxidation of sulfhydryl functions (Radi et al., 1991b) and aconitase inhibition (Hausladen and Fridovich, 1994; Castro et al., 1994). It has therefore been proposed that -OONO is responsible for a significant portion of macrophage derived cytotoxicity through a direct reaction of -OONO with critical cellular components (Koppenol et al., 1992). However, a recent report utilizing NO donor compounds indicated that NO was particularly tumoricidal in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and not O2. Thus, it has been suggested that -OONO may not be the only mechanism responsible for the cytotoxic actions of NO (at least in the hepatoma cell line utilized in that study) (Ioannidis and de Groot, 1993). nitric oxide glutathione glutathione peroxidase S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine 3-morpholino-sydnonimine. H2O2 is formed as an indirect product of macrophage activation (via the dismutation of O2). Therefore, we have performed a detailed examination of the chemistry and enzymology of possible NO/H2O2 interactions with tumor cell components in order to evaluate the possible role of NO/H2O2 in macrophage-mediated tumoricidal activity. Herein, we present evidence confirming the original observations of Ioannidis and de Groot(1993) indicating that the combination of NO and H2O2 was particularly cytotoxic to a human ovarian cancer cell line, and we propose a mechanism, based on a novel chemical process involving both NO and H2O2, for macrophage and/or NO-mediated tumoricidal activity. Furthermore, we present evidence supporting a hypothesis that may explain cell susceptibility/resistance toward NO-mediated cytotoxicity. Superoxide dismutase (bovine erythrocytes), catalase (bovine liver), glutathione peroxidase (bovine erythrocytes) (GSHPx), glutathione reductase (Bakers' yeast), glutathione (GSH), NADPH, sodium azide, EDTA, 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), epidermal growth factor, transferrin, insulin, and endothelial cell growth supplement were all purchased from Sigma. Selenious acid (H2SeO3) and all organic chemicals were obtained from Aldrich and were of the highest purity available. Ebselen was purchased from Biomol Research Labs (Plymouth Labs, PA). 3-Morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1) was obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) was synthesized by the method of Field et al.(1978). Potassium phosphate, ferric chloride, ferrous sulfate, and H2O2 (30%) were purchased from Fisher. NO gas was purchased from Matheson (Cucamunga, CA) and passed through aqueous base prior to utilization. All chemical reactions and manipulations were performed under strict anaerobic conditions. Oxygen was purged from all systems by utilizing several vacuum-N2 purge cycles on a high vacuum line, and manipulations of gas and liquid samples were carried out using N2-purged gas-tight syringes. Introduction of reactants to reaction solutions was accomplished via injection through rubber septa. Water was purified by distillation in an all-glass apparatus. H2O2 concentrations in stock solutions were determined by iodometric titration (Jeffery et al., 1989). The human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line NIH:OVCAR-3 (OVCAR) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell manipulation was performed as described previously (Farias-Eisner et al., 1994). Cell viability was determined by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity in the cell media by a method previously described (Wroblewski and LaDue, 1955). Briefly, lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured in cell culture supernatants after a 48-h incubation in the absence and the presence of the NO donors. Cytotoxicity was expressed as the percentage of total lactate dehydrogenase activity present in the 0.5 × 106 OVCAR cells/well incubated with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 23°C. SIN-1 solutions were made up and manipulated as described previously (Kroncke et al., 1993). The time course of toxicity was determined for 5 mM SIN-1. Thus, cell viability was monitored by the method described above over a time period of 48 h with time points at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h. OVCAR cell viability was determined as described above in the presence and the absence of catalase (400 units/ml), superoxide dismutase (200 units/ml), and H2O2 (100 μM). The concentration of superoxide dismutase was chosen on the basis of previous observations by Darley-Usmar et al. (1992), who demonstrated that superoxide dismutase was able to compete with NO for O2 at a similar SIN-1/superoxide dismutase ratio. Catalase-mediated degradation of H2O2 in the presence and the absence of NO was determined. H2O2 loss was measured by the general method of Beers and Sizer(1952). Thus, 2.9 ml of an 18 mM solution of H2O2 in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was added to a 4-ml cuvette. The cuvette was then degassed. To start the reaction, 0.100 ml of a degassed solution of catalase (2.5 μg/ml) in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was introduced to the H2O2 solution. The loss of H2O2 in solution was then determined by monitoring the loss of absorbance at 240 nm over a 1-min period. In the sample containing NO, 10 μl of pure NO gas (approximately 0.45 μmol) was introduced into the 1-ml headspace of the degassed H2O2 solution. The solution was then shaken vigorously prior to the introduction of catalase. Catalase activity was calculated by the method recommended by the supplier (Sigma). Briefly, the time (t) required for a decrease in absorbance, at 240 nm, of 0.05 absorbance units was recorded (in the linear portion of the curve). This corresponds to the decomposition of 3.45 μmol of H2O2. Thus, 3.45 μmol/t/mg catalase = the reported enzyme activity. The concentration of NO in the catalase solution was determined by analyzing a 1-ml aliquot from the cuvette using a previously described procedure (Fukuto et al., 1992). Briefly, the 1-ml sample was introduced into a 10-ml flask, the gaseous contents of the solution were sparged with N2, and the gas stream was passed into a chemiluminescence detector (Antek 720, Houston, TX). Quantitation of the NO evolved was accomplished by comparison of the detector response with that of known standards of authentic NO. Also, the expected concentration of NO in the catalase solution was calculated using Henry's law and Henry's coefficient for NO previously reported (Shaw and Vosper, 1977). The two values were found to be in close agreement, 15.5 μM (experimentally determined) and 20 μM (calculated). The activity of GSHPx was determined by the general method of Wendel(1981). Thus, 1 ml of a 0.3 units/ml solution of GSHPx in 0.25 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2.5 mM EDTA and 2.5 mM sodium azide, was placed into a 4-ml cuvette. Then 200 μl each of the following solutions were added to the cuvette: glutathione reductase (6 units/ml in the above buffer solution), GSH (10 mM in distilled water), and NADPH (2.5 mM in 0.1% NaHCO3 solution). The cuvette was sealed with a rubber septum and degassed. The solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min (to allow reduction of GSHPx by GSH). The reaction was run at room temperature and started by the addition of 200 μl of a degassed 12 mM solution of H2O2. The decrease in the NADPH level was then determined by monitoring the absorbance at 366 nm. The effect of NO on NADPH consumption was determined in two ways. First, 50 μl of NO gas (approximately 2.2 μmol) was introduced to the enzyme solution prior to the addition of H2O2. The solution was then shaken, and then hydrogen peroxide was added. In another experiment, the rate of NADPH loss was monitored for 2 min in the absence of NO. Then 50 μl of NO gas was added, and the rate of NADPH loss was monitored afterwards. As controls, spontaneous NADPH loss in both the presence and the absence of NO was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 366 nm in the absence of GSHPx and was subtracted from values obtained in the presence of GSHPx. Note: The addition of 50 μl of NO to the control experiments either prior to the addition of H2O2 or after 2 min of incubation did not significantly affect the rate of spontaneous NADPH loss. The same procedure described above for measuring GSHPx activity was utilized except that a 50 μM solution of ebselen in buffer was utilized in place of GSHPx (final ebselen concentrations in the incubations was 28 μM). Ebselen was solubilized by first dissolving it in a minimum amount of Me2SO prior to the addition to the 0.25 M phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0, containing 2.5 mM EDTA and 2.5 mM sodium azide (Me2SO concentration in the incubations was always <0.25%). As described above, all solutions were degassed on a vacuum line prior to the initiation of the reaction. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 μl of a 12.5 mM degassed solution of H2O2. In incubations carried out in the presence of NO, 50 μl of pure NO gas was injected into the headspace of the degassed cuvette containing all the reaction components except H2O2. The cuvette was then vigorously shaken before the addition of H2O2. The reactions were followed over 90 s by monitoring the absorbance at 366 nm. Control experiments were performed in the absence of ebselen to determine the spontaneous rate of NADPH degradation. These control values were subtracted from the values obtained in the presence of ebselen. OVCAR cell viability was determined by performing the above experiments measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity in the presence and the absence of ebselen (10 μM). This concentration of ebselen was chosen on the basis of prior observations by others (Leurs et al., 1990; Chaudiere et al., 1984). Following a general method previously described by Julian et al.(1992), cells were cultured in the absence of serum using instead an artificial serum extender. Thus, minimum essential medium was utilized in the presence of the following medium supplements: epidermal growth factor (2 ng/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), insulin (2.5 μg/ml), and endothelial cell growth supplement (7.75 μg/ml). In instances where the effect of added selenium was examined, selenious acid was added to the artificial serum extender at a 25 nM concentration (note: selenious acid has been previously determined to be a bioavailable and relatively nontoxic form of selenium at this concentration (Hocman, 1988)). The exposure of these cells to SIN-1 was performed identically to those described above for the serum-cultured OVCAR cells. Cytotoxicity was monitored by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release from these cells as described above. The determination of GSHPx activity in these cells was performed using the method of Paglia and Valentine(1967). Into three 25-ml round bottom flasks equipped with septum-sealed stopcocks were added 15 ml of purified water. To two flasks was then added 0.1 mmol of H2O2. Nothing was added to the third flask. All three flasks were then degassed. To all flasks 2.4 ml of pure NO gas was then added. 200 μl of headspace gas was then sampled from each flask at 5-10-min intervals and analyzed by injection into the chemiluminescence detector. After 35 min, 0.01 mmol of ferric chloride taken up in a minimal amount of degassed water was added. Monitoring of headspace NO levels then continued for another 30 min. Spectroscopic studies were carried out on a Uvikon 810 spectrophotometer (San Diego, CA) operating at 200-800 nm. In a typical experiment, 2 ml of a 1 mM solution of either FeCl3•6H2O or FeSO4•7H2O in N2-degassed water (final pH values of these solutions were approximately 3.1 and 5.4, respectively) was placed into a 3-ml quartz cuvette equipped with a gas tight rubber septum. The solution was then degassed, and the cuvettes were left under N2 for the duration of the experiments. Pure NO gas and/or H2O2 were added to the cuvettes, and changes in absorbance of these solutions were recorded on a strip chart recorder. Nitrite and nitrate determinations were performed as described previously (Bush et al., 1992) using the general methods of Braman and Hendrix(1989). Briefly, measurement of NO2- levels were made by monitoring NO evolution via chemiluminescence detection from a measured sample placed into a refluxing solution of iodide/acetic acid (this solution will only reduce NO2- and not NO3- to NO). Total NOx (NO2- plus NO3-) determinations were made by monitoring NO evolution from a measured sample placed into a boiling VCl3/HCl solution (this solution will reduce both NO2- and NO3- to NO). The determination of NO3- levels was made by simply subtracting the value for NO2- from the NOx value from duplicate samples analyzed by both methods. Quantitation was accomplished using a standard curve made up of known amounts of NO2- and NO3-. Thus, in a typical experiment, the appropriate metal salt was placed into a 10-ml flask equipped with a serum-capped stopcock. The salt was then taken up in 2 ml of water and degassed. Then NO gas was injected into the reaction headspace. When required, the addition of H2O2 to these solutions was also made via injection of a degassed stock solution in water. Reaction times were chosen on the basis of the spectroscopic studies described above. That is, because the reduction of Fe(III) by NO was found to be slow, such reactions were allowed to run for 15 min, whereas the reaction between H2O2 and Fe(II), which was found to be extremely fast, was run for only 1 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of strong base (NO2- is unstable under acidic conditions, especially in the presence of H2O2). The reaction flask was then degassed again to remove any unreacted NO. Aliquots of the solution were then analyzed immediately. Control experiments were performed to assure the stability of measured species, NO2- and NO3-, under the assay and reaction conditions. In a typical experiment, 0.3 mmol of benzene in 15 ml of purified water (20 mM, the approximate maximum solubility in water) containing 0.3 mmol of H2O2 (20 mM) and 3.6 μmol of ferric chloride (0.2 mM) was oxidized in the presence of 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 equivalent of NO (based on benzene) for the appropriate time under anaerobic conditions. The reactions were terminated by immediate extraction of the organic products and reactant with 2 × 25 ml of ethyl ether containing internal standard (phenethyl alcohol). The organic extract was then dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction products was accomplished using a Hewlett-Packard 5880 gas chromatograph utilizing a 25 meter, 5% phenylmethyl silicone column, 0.32 micron film, 0.2-mm inner diameter operating at a flow of approximately 0.8 ml/min with the following temperature program: initial temperature, 100°C; initial time, 5 min; program rate, 10°C/min; final temperature, 225°C; final time, 5 min. Reaction products were identified on the basis of the comparison of the retention time with authentic standards (phenol, 4.77 min). Reaction products were also characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectral analysis on a Hewlett-Packard 5971A, operating at 70 eV and utilizing a 12.5-m HP-1 column. Reaction product identification was confirmed by comparison of the mass spectra with published spectra (McLafferty and Stauffer, 1988). Quantitation of reaction products was accomplished by standard curve analysis using phenethyl alcohol as an internal standard. SIN-1 is a well known NO donor (for example, see Ioannidis and de Groot(1993)) and was found to cause a significant loss of OVCAR cell viability (as measured by lactate dehydrogenase release into the media) (Fig. 1). 5 mM SIN-1 resulted in a release of over 75% of total lactate dehydrogenase into the cell media. Similar results were also observed using another NO donor, SNAP, as well (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that NO derived from these NO donors is indeed cytotoxic to OVCAR cells. It should be noted that NO and/or the NO donors were determined to have no effect on the lactate dehydrogenase assay (data not shown). Also, the time course for toxicity was determined for 5 mM SIN-1, and little or no toxicity was observed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h following initial exposure to SIN-1. Significant toxicity was only observed after 48 h. Therefore, cell viability was determined 48 h after initial exposure to SIN-1. The duration of exposure of the OVCAR cells to NO released from SIN-1 at 2.5 and 5 mM initial concentrations is somewhat difficult to determine because previous kinetic studies of NO release from SIN-1 show a nonlinear relationship with concentration (Ioannidis and deGroot, 1993; Feelisch and Noack, 1987). However, the most conservative estimate using the available kinetic data would indicate that NO release from SIN-1 at either 2.5 or 5 mM should be >94% complete after 24 h. Superoxide dismutase was found to enhance the cytotoxic effect of 2.5 mM SIN-1 (Fig. 1), whereas protection against SIN-1-mediated cytotoxicity was observed when catalase was added. The addition of only H2O2 (100 μM in the absence of SIN-1) to the cell incubation did not result in a significant loss of cell viability. However, 100 μM H2O2 was found to be cytotoxic in the presence of SNAP (that is, SNAP cytotoxicity was significantly enhanced in the presence of 100 μM H2O2; data not shown). The above data implicate both NO and H2O2 as being involved in the observed cytotoxicity. Because cells are normally able to keep H2O2 levels at a minimum by utilizing enzymes that specifically degrade H2O2 to innocuous species, the effect of NO on these enzymes, catalase and the GSHPx-glutathione reductase system, was examined. Under anaerobic conditions (to assure a significant lifetime for NO under the experimental conditions), the effect of NO on catalase activity was determined. When approximately 0.45 μmol of pure NO gas was introduced to an incubation consisting of 5 units of catalase (0.25 μg) in 3 ml of 18 mM H2O2, the enzyme activity decreased to approximately 23% of the control value (Table 1). The concentration of NO in the catalase/H2O2 solution was determined to be 15.5 μM (which is in close agreement with the value calculated from Henry's law of 20 μM).Tabled 1 The catalytic reduction of H2O2 by GSH requires two enzymes, GSHPx, which reduces H2O2 to H2O using GSH, and glutathione reductase, which converts the GSH disulfide (glutathione) back to the reduced form at the expense of NADPH (Wendel, 1980). Because NADPH is consumed in this system, the activity of the GSHPx-glutathione reductase system can be monitored by measuring NADPH consumption. Thus, the effect of NO on NADPH consumption by the GSHPx-glutathione reductase system was examined. To assure a significant lifetime for NO under the experimental conditions, the incubations were carried out under anaerobic conditions. When NO was added to the GSHPx-glutathione reductase system (containing NADPH and GSH) either prior to or 2 min after initiating the reaction with hydrogen peroxide addition, no effect on the rate of NADPH consumption was observed when compared with controls run in the absence of NO (data not shown). Significantly, in control experiments where the rate of NADPH consumption was monitored in the absence of GSHPx (a value subtracted from the values obtained in the complete system), the addition of NO did not alter the spontaneous rate of NADPH degradation. This indicates that the decrease in NADPH was not due to a reaction with the NO/H2O2 but rather was due to the GSHPx-glutathione reductase enzyme system. It is also worth noting that in reactions carried out aerobically, NO did not affect GSHPx activity. Thus, NO does not affect the ability of the GSHPx-glutathione reductase system to degrade H2O2. The effect of ebselen was examined for its ability to protect against SIN-1/superoxide dismutase. As expected, the addition of ebselen to OVCAR cells resulted in a dramatic increase in resistance to SIN-1-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 2). Also, like the GSHPx-glutathione reductase system, NO was found to have no effect on the peroxidase activity of ebselen. Because GSHPx is a selenium-dependent enzyme, depletion of selenium from cultured cells results in a decrease in their GSHPx activity. In tissue culture, the source of selenium is serum. Therefore, OVCAR cells were cultured using an artificial serum mixture in which the concentration of selenium (in the form of selenious acid) could be manipulated. It was found that cells cultured in the absence of selenium exhibited a 28% decrease in GSHPx activity compared with cells cultured with 25 nM selenium. Significantly, the selenium deplete cells also exhibited an increased susceptibility to the cytotoxicity associated with SIN-1 compared with cells cultured in the presence of selenium (Fig. 3). Selenium depletion appeared to have little or no effect on the overall viability of the cells in the absence of SIN-1. Because it appears that the combination of NO and H2O2 is particularly cytotoxic to OVCAR cells, studies were then undertaken to attempt to determine if chemistry between NO and H2O2 exists that may be responsible for these observations. Under anaerobic conditions, NO did not react with H2O2. That is, when 2.4 ml of gaseous NO (approximately 0.1 mmol) was added to a flask containing 15 ml of 6.7 mM H2O2, no loss of NO from the reaction headspace was found after 35 min. However, the addition of 0.01 mmol of ferric chloride resulted in a rapid consumption of NO as evidenced by a drop in NO levels in the reaction headspace. 25 min after the addition of ferric ion, over 50% of the NO was consumed (Fig. 4). Moreover, analysis of the aqueous phase of the reaction mixture showed that no NO remained in solution (data not shown). The loss of NO exceeded the amount of iron added, indicating that the reaction was catalytic in ferric ion. Control reactions that lacked either hydrogen peroxide or ferric ion addition showed no loss of NO gas in the headspace (Fig. 4) and a significant amount of dissolved NO (data not shown). Spectroscopic studies were then performed to determine the possible interactions of NO and iron in solution. Thus, the addition of excess NO gas to a 1 mM Fe(III) (FeCl3) solution resulted in the gradual formation of an apparent NO adduct as indicated by the appearance of absorbances at 436 and 578 nm. Significantly, the addition of NO to a 1 mM Fe(II) (FeSO4) solution resulted in the rapid formation of the same adduct as evidenced by the identical UV-visible spectrum. The absorbance spectrum of the apparent NO adduct is identical to that of the so-called “brown ring” complex, Fe(II)NO(H2O)5 with λmax = 436 and 578 nm (Littlejohn and Chang, 1982). Thus, it is apparent that NO is able to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II) in water to generate an +NO (or equivalent) species. Reaction of +NO with water should yield, as the nitrogen oxide product, NO2- (and). Complexation of Fe(II) by another equivalent of NO would then give the observed brown ring complex (). NO + Fe(III) →[Fe(III)-NO ↔ Fe(II)-+NO][Fe(III)-NO ↔ Fe(II)-+NO] + H2O → Fe(II) + NO2−+2H+Fe(II)-(H2O)5 + NO → Fe(II)-NO(H2O)5 (brown ring complex) In the absence of any oxidizing agents, the Fe(II)-NO complex would be the terminal product. However, the formation of an Fe(II) species in the presence of an oxidizing agent like H2O2 should lead to the formation of a potent oxidizing species like •OH via a Fenton process (). (Note: the addition of H2O2 to the brown ring complex results in a rapid disappearance of the complex as evidenced by the immediate loss of the absorbances at 436 and 578 nm; data not shown.) Fe(II) + H2O2 → Fe(III) + HO- + ⋅ OH Therefore, a solution of Fe(III), NO, and H2O2 should be capable of reacting by the process defined by the sum of, and ().overall NO + H2O2 → NO2−+⋅OH+H+ Thus, represents a process by which NO and H2O2 can react, in the presence of a catalytic amount of a trace metal, to generate a potent oxidizing species like •OH. As indicated in, the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) should result in NO2- generation exclusively. This was tested when 5 ml of NO gas (approximately 220 μmol) was introduced into the headspace of a 10-ml flask containing a 2-ml solution of Fe(III)Cl3 (2 mM) in water under anaerobic conditions, followed by the addition of NaOH after 30 min (to quench the reaction and stabilize the nitrogen oxide products) and degassing (to remove the excess NO). Analysis of the inorganic nitrogen products showed exclusive generation of NO2-. Only trace amounts of NO3- were detected. Also, a 2 mM, anaerobic solution of Fe(III)Cl3 in water was reacted with NO gas (5 ml in the reaction headspace as described above) and 1 equivalent of H2O2. After 15 min, the reaction was quenched with base, degassed and the levels of NO2- and NO3- determined. Again, NO2- was the primary nitrogen oxide product with only trace amounts of NO3- detected. If, indeed, •OH were generated in solution, it may be expected that excess NO could trap this reactive species to give NO2- (). ⋅ OH + NO → NO2−+ H+ This is apparently the case under the conditions of these experiments because a 0.2 mM solution of Fe(II)SO4 in water was found to react under anaerobic conditions with NO (excess) and H2O2 (1 equivalent) to give NO2- as the primary nitrogen oxide with NO3- present in only trace amounts. The results of these studies are summarized in Table 2.Tabled 1 Aromatic ring hydroxylation is an established reaction of •OH (Kaur and Halliwell, 1994). Therefore, the oxidation of benz"
https://openalex.org/W2140355533,"Insulin activation of Ras is mediated by the plasma membrane targeting of the guanylnucleotide exchange factor SOS associated with the small adapter protein Grb2. SOS also lies in an insulin-stimulated feedback pathway in which the serine/threonine phosphorylation of SOS results in disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex thereby limiting the extent of Ras activation. To examine the relative role of the mitogen-activated protein kinases in the feedback phosphorylation of SOS we determined the signaling specificity of insulin, osmotic shock, and anisomycin to activate the ERK (extracellular-signal regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun kinase) pathways. In Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human insulin receptor and murine 3T3L1 adipocytes, insulin specifically activated ERK with no significant effect on JNK, whereas anisomycin specifically activated JNK but was unable to activate ERK. In contrast, osmotic shock was equally effective in the activation of both kinase pathways. Insulin and osmotic shock, but not anisomycin, resulted in SOS phosphorylation and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex, demonstrating that the JNK pathway was not involved in the insulin-stimulated feedback uncoupling of the Grb2-SOS complex. Both the insulin and osmotic shock-induced activation of ERK was prevented by treatment of cells with the specific MEK inhibitor (PD98059). However, expression of dominant-interfering Ras (N17Ras) inhibited the insulin- but not osmotic shock-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK and SOS.

Thus, the tyrosine phosphorylation of transmembrane receptors and/or Shc results in the formation of a ternary complex (i.e. Shc-Grb2-SOS) that targets SOS to the plasma membrane location of Ras (8.Buday L.

The carboxyl-terminal domain of SOS is proline-rich and contains multiple MAP kinase consensus phosphorylation sites suggestive of an insulin-stimulated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK feedback phosphorylation cascade. However, growth factors have been reported to activate the stress-activated protein kinases and their role in the regulation of SOS phosphorylation and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex has not yet been addressed. In this article, we have demonstrated that the ERK pathway is specifically responsible for the feedback phosphorylation of SOS and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that, in contrast to insulin, osmotic shock activates ERK via a MEK-dependent but Ras-independent pathway. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human insulin receptor (CHO/IR) and 3T3L1 adipocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously(20.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 4 h in serum-free media and in some experiments were then pretreated 1 h with vehicle (0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide) or 100 μM PD98059 (Parke-Davis, Warner-Lambert, Co). The cells were then incubated with and without 100 nM insulin, 50 μg/ml anisomycin, or 600 mM sorbitol for various times, followed by lysis in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 2 μM pepstatin, 0.5 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μM leupeptin. Grb2 was immunoprecipitated from the whole cell lysates by incubation with a Grb2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4°C. The resultant immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4°C. The pellets were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl), resuspended in SDS sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and heated at 100°C for 5 min. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on reducing 5-10% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes using 1 A for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoblotting of the whole cell lysates or Grb2 immunoprecipitates was performed using a ERK monoclonal antibody (Zymed), a pp90rsk polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a SOS polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc). The immunoblots were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). All the immunoblots presented are representative of at least two experiments. We have recently demonstrated that electroporation can be used to express various cDNAs in CHO/IR with 85-100% transfection efficiency (22.Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31107-31114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO/IR cells were electroporated with a total of 40 μg of the dominant-interfering Ras mutant (N17Ras) or the empty parent vector (CMV5) at 340 volts and 960 microfarads in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Following electroporation, the cells were plated in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% serum. Cell debris was removed by replacing media with fresh media 12 h later. Cells were harvested in 200 μl lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.3 M NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μM pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The cleared extract was diluted with 200 μl of lysis buffer (minus Triton X-100 and NaCl) plus the addition of 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and 3.5 mM MgCl2. To determine ERK activity, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with an ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose. The pellets were incubated with 40 μg of myelin basic protein plus [γ-32P]ATP (20 μM, 6 μCi/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and the proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. JNK activity was determined by incubation of the diluted whole cell extracts with 10 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun1-79 conjugated to glutathione-agarose beads (prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions, Pharmacia) for 4 h at 4°C. The agarose beads were pelleted by quick microcentrifugation, and the protein complexes were washed three times with HEPES binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100). The final wash was in kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 2 mM dithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was initiated by resuspending the pelleted beads in 30 μl of kinase buffer plus [γ-32P]ATP (20 μM, 5 μCi/reaction) for 20 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold HEPES binding buffer, the beads were pelleted, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Previous studies have demonstrated that various stress-related stimuli activate the JNK pathway(18.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakakl E. Dal T. Ruble E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). To determine the relative effect of cellular stress and insulin on ERK activation, we treated Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human insulin receptor (CHO/IR) with a protein synthesis inhibitor (Anisomycin), osmotic shock (Sorbitol), and insulin (Fig. 1). As previously reported(19.Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), insulin treatment resulted in a time-dependent reduction in SOS electrophoretic mobility characteristic of serine/threonine phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, top). The time course of SOS phosphorylation paralleled an increase in ERK activity as determined by p90rsk phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, middle) and decreased electrophoretic mobility of the two ERK isoforms (Fig. 1A, bottom). Similarly, osmotic shock induced by 600 mM sorbitol treatment resulted in a time-dependent phosphorylation of SOS which paralleled the phosphorylation of p90rsk and ERK (Fig. 1B). However, the effect of osmotic shock to stimulate these events was significantly slower but more persistent than that of insulin. For example, maximal ERK phosphorylation occurred by 2-5 min following insulin treatment and almost completely returned to the basal state by 60 min (Fig. 1A, bottom). However, osmotic shock required approximately 10-30 min for near-maximal phosphorylation of ERK which was persistently phosphorylated up to 60 min (Fig. 1B, bottom). In contrast to insulin and osmotic shock, the stress inducing agent anisomycin had no significant effect on SOS, p90rsk, or ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). To ensure that these effects on the ERK pathway were not unique to CHO/IR cells, we also determined the effect of insulin, osmotic shock, and anisomycin in differentiated murine 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2). Compared to control cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1) insulin treatment for 5 or 30 min resulted in the characteristic transient decrease in ERK mobility (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 6). Similar to the CHO/IR cells, osmotic shock also induced a greater extent of ERK phosphorylation at 30 than at 5 min (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 7), whereas anisomycin treatment was without effect (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5). These findings were recapitulated when we examined the effect of insulin, osmotic shock, and anisomycin on SOS phosphorylation. Treatment of cells with insulin for 5 or 30 min resulted in the phosphorylation of SOS (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 6). Osmotic shock also induced SOS phosphorylation but with a slower time course being indiscernible at 5 min and clearly gel shifted by 30 min (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 7). Again, anisomycin treatment was unable to induce SOS phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 5) compared to untreated 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2B, lane 1). The phosphorylation of ERK detected by decreased electrophoretic mobility is an indirect assessment of stimulated ERK enzymatic activity. We therefore directly examined the effect of insulin, osmotic shock, and anisomycin to increase ERK protein kinase activity using myelin basic protein as a convenient in vitro substrate in ERK immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A, top). As expected, treatment of CHO/IR cells with insulin for 5 min resulted in a large increase in ERK activity (Fig. 3A, lane 6) which returned to near the control level after 30 min (Fig. 3A, lane 3). On the other hand, osmotic shock had only a small effect at 5 min (Fig. 3A, lane 7) but markedly increased myelin basic protein phosphorylation at 30 min (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Consistent with the changes in ERK phosphorylation, anisomycin treatment had no significant effect on ERK activity (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 5) compared to the control cells (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Osmotic shock and anisomycin treatment have been previously reported to be potent activators of the JNK pathway(15.Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.-H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 24.Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the activation of JNK under these conditions using the amino-terminal domain of c-Jun (c-Jun) as a specific substrate (Fig. 3A, bottom). In contrast to ERK, insulin was unable to induce any significant increase in JNK activity (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 6). However, 5 min following osmotic shock there was a small increase in JNK activity which was dramatically increased by 30 min (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 7). Although anisomycin was unable to increase ERK phosphorylation or activity, 30 min of anisomycin treatment activated JNK as potently as did osmotic shock (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Essentially identical results were recapitulated in the 3T3L1 adipocytes except that anisomycin was not as strong a stimulator of JNK activity compared to osmotic shock (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, taken together these data demonstrate that insulin is a relatively potent activator of ERK and does not appreciably stimulate the JNK pathway in either CHO/IR or 3T3L1 adipocytes. In contrast, anisomycin is a strong activator of JNK but a relatively poor stimulator of the ERK pathway. Furthermore, osmotic shock can stimulate both pathways to the same relative extent, albeit with a slightly slower time course than the insulin activation of ERK. Having established the signaling pathway specificity and phosphorylation of SOS by these stimuli, we next determined their effect on the interaction of Grb2 with SOS (Fig. 4). We and others have reported that insulin stimulation induces a disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex(19.Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous findings, immunoprecipitation of Grb2 from CHO/IR cells treated with insulin for 5 or 30 min resulted in a reduction in the amount of co-immunoprecipitated SOS (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 6) compared to control cells (Fig. 4, lane 1). In parallel to the extent of SOS phosphorylation, osmotic shock for 5 min had no significant effect on the amount of Grb2 immunoprecipitated SOS protein (Fig. 4, lane 7), whereas osmotic shock for 30 min resulted in a disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (Fig. 4, lane 4). Even though anisomycin was a potent activator of JNK, neither 5 nor 30 min of anisomycin treatment had any effect on the Grb2-SOS complex (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 5). As a control for immunoprecipitation, Grb2 immunoblotting of these immunoprecipitates demonstrated identical amounts of Grb2 protein (data not shown). It should also be noted that in the insulin-stimulated cells the small amount of SOS remaining associated with Grb2 had a similar mobility compared to the Grb2 immunoprecipitated SOS protein from unstimulated cells. This could reflect a small population of SOS that was not phosphorylated and remained tightly bound to Grb2 under these conditions. In any case, these data indicate that the signaling events mediating the disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex was independent of the JNK pathway. Receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation of ERK activity requires a MEK-dependent phosphorylation of ERK on threonine and tyrosine residues in a consensus TEY motif(25.Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). To determine whether osmotic shock utilized a MEK-dependent phosphorylation event, we took advantage of the recently identified MEK inhibitor, PD98059(21.Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.J. Guan K.L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20883-20886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). In mock treated cells (Fig. 5, Vehicle), insulin and osmotic shock both stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-7), whereas anisomycin was without effect (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3). Pretreatment of the cells with 100 μM of the MEK inhibitor (PD98059) substantially reduced both the insulin and osmotic shock stimulated phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 5A, lanes 11-14). Similar to Figure 1:, Figure 2:, in the absence of PD98059 maximal SOS phosphorylation occurred within 5 min of insulin treatment (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 5). Although a small SOS gel shift was detected following 5 min of osmotic shock, maximal SOS phosphorylation required 30 min (Fig. 5B, lanes 6 and 7). In parallel, the insulin and osmotic shock stimulated SOS phosphorylation was partially inhibited by PD98059 pretreatment (Fig. 5B, lanes 11-14). Since anisomycin did not stimulate SOS phosphorylation (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 3), PD98059 treatment had no effect on the mobility of SOS in anisomycin-stimulated cells (Fig. 5B, lanes 9 and 10). This blockade of ERK and SOS phosphorylation by PD98059 directly correlated with the partial inhibition of ERK protein kinase activity following stimulation with both insulin and osmotic shock (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 4-7 with lanes 11-14). In contrast, anisomycin activation of JNK activity (Fig. 5D, lanes 2 and 3) was unaffected by the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 5D, lanes 9 and 10). Similarly, the stimulation of JNK activity by osmotic shock (Fig. 5D, lanes 6 and 7) was unchanged by pretreatment with PD98059 (Fig. 5D, lanes 13 and 14). These data demonstrate that PD98059 is a relatively effective inhibitor of ERK activation without significantly affecting the JNK pathway. In addition, the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PD98059 indicates that both osmotic shock and insulin activate ERK through a MEK-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, these results are consistent with SOS phosphorylation requiring a MEK-dependent phosphorylation cascade independent of the JNK pathway. In the case of growth factor stimulated tyrosine kinase activity, Ras functions upstream of MEK in the kinase cascade leading to ERK phosphorylation(27.Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 5: 1288-1299PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether osmotic shock activation of ERK also utilizes a Ras-dependent pathway, we transfected cells with the dominant-interfering N17Ras mutant (Fig. 6). CHO/IR cells transfected with the empty expression plasmid (Vector) demonstrated a transient insulin stimulation of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 3) whereas osmotic shock induced a slower but more persistent phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 6A, lanes 4 and 5). Expression of dominant-interfering Ras (N17Ras) partially inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 7 and 8). Surprisingly, however, expression of dominant-interfering Ras had no effect on osmotic shock activation of ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 9 and 10). As previously observed, osmotic shock resulted in SOS phosphorylation but which occurred at a later time than the SOS phosphorylation induced by insulin treatment (Fig. 6B, lanes 1-5). Consistent with the ability of dominant-interfering Ras to partially inhibit insulin-stimulated ERK phosphorylation there was a concomitant partial inhibition of SOS phosphorylation (Fig. 6B, lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, the inability of dominant-interfering Ras to prevent osmotic shock induced ERK phosphorylation also directly correlated with its inability to prevent SOS phosphorylation (Fig. 6B, lanes 9 and 10). Previous studies have also demonstrated that JNK activation primarily occurs through a Ras-independent pathway(28.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 29.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, expression of dominant-interfering Ras had no effect on the osmotic shock stimulation of JNK activity (Fig. 6C). Thus, these data demonstrate that although insulin utilizes a Ras-dependent mechanism leading to the activation of ERK and SOS phosphorylation, stimulation of these events by osmotic shock occurs independent of Ras function. Previous studies have reported that insulin treatment results in the serine/threonine phosphorylation of SOS and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex(19.Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20883-20886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). SOS contains a carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region which has several consensus sites for the MAP kinase family of protein kinase(30.Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4717-4720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since ERK can phosphorylate SOS in vitro and overexpression of ERK results in the hyperphosphorylation of SOS in vivo, it has been speculated that ERK is the physiological kinase responsible for the serine/threonine phosphorylation of SOS(20.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30.Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15756-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other MAP kinase family members such as JNK or p38/HOG1 have overlapping substrate specificities and stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase also results in SOS phosphorylation as well as activation of both the ERK and JNK pathways(32.Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of these other MAP kinases in SOS phosphorylation and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex has not been addressed. The objectives of this study were to determine whether insulin could also signal through the JNK pathway and whether this phosphorylation cascade contributed to the regulation of SOS phosphorylation and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex. To address these issues, we compared the signaling specificities of insulin, osmotic shock, and anisomycin to activate the ERK and JNK kinase cascades in CHO/IR and 3T3L1 adipocytes. These data demonstrated that insulin was relatively specific for the ERK pathway with essentially no activation of JNK. In contrast, osmotic shock was capable of activating both pathways to comparable extents, although ERK activation was prolonged as compared to insulin. On the other hand, anisomycin was a potent activator of the JNK pathway which did not appreciably stimulate the ERK pathway. This latter finding is somewhat different than that recently reported for anisomycin-treated HeLa cells (33.Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Kracht M. Sachsenmaier C. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this study, in-gel protein kinase assays demonstrated both the anisomycin and cycloheximide stimulation of p55 and p45 protein kinases (JNK1 and JNK2) as well as p42 and p44 protein kinases (ERK1 and ERK2). The basis for this discrepancy is not clear at present but probably reflects the use of different cell types (HeLa versus CHO/IR and 3T3L1 adipocytes) in these two studies. Nevertheless, in both CHO/IR and 3T3L1 adipocytes only the agents which activated the ERK pathway were capable of inducing SOS phosphorylation and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex. Thus, these data demonstrate that SOS is not a JNK substrate and that this pathway does not play a significant role in the desensitization phase following Ras activation. Since osmotic shock was a potent stimulus for ERK activation, we anticipated that this would result from the well established Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. To test this hypothesis, the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 (21.Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.J. Guan K.L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20883-20886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) was used to prevent MEK, hence ERK, activation following both insulin and osmotic shock stimulation. Under these conditions there was a partial inhibition in the reduction of SOS mobility indicating a requirement for MEK activation to achieve the full extent of SOS phosphorylation. Surprisingly, however, expression of dominant-interfering Ras (N17Ras) had no effect on either ERK or SOS phosphorylation induced by osmotic shock. The functional effectiveness of N17Ras expression was demonstrated by the inhibition of insulin-stimulated ERK and SOS phosphorylation. Thus, these data support the presence of an osmotic shock stimulated pathway that integrates into the ERK cascade downstream of Ras. Our data are consistent with recent studies demonstrating that some cell types have both tyrosine kinase receptor and trimeric G-protein-coupled receptor-stimulated pathways that lead to MEK activation, and hence ERK activation, independent of both Ras and Raf function(34.Faure M. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35.Burgering B.M.T. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Medema R.H. van Weeren P.C. Tertoolen L.G.J. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Recently, we have observed that the insulin stimulation of both SOS phosphorylation and disassociation of the Grb2-SOS complex occurs by a MEK-dependent mechanism. Consistent with this model, inhibition of MEK activation prevented both ERK and SOS phosphorylation in response to insulin and osmotic shock. However, it is important to recognize that the data presented in this article do not distinguish between MEK or a MEK-dependent kinase as being responsible for SOS phosphorylation. In any case, since MEK activation requires phosphorylation on serine residues by a MAP kinase kinase kinase, we speculate that the osmotic shock signaling pathway(s) converge at the level of MEK, independent of Ras. Currently, the Raf kinase family members have been shown to be immediate upstream activators of MEK(37.Macdonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R. Erikson R.L. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6615-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 38.Huang W.D. Alessandrini A. Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10947-10951Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, several studies have also identified other MAP kinase kinase kinase activities which function as MEK kinases or activators (39.Haystead C.M.M. Gregory P. Shirazi A. Fadden P. Mosse C. Dent P. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12804-12808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Russell M. Lange-Carter C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11757-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We therefore speculate that osmotic shock activates a Ras-independent pathway which integrates at the level of a MAP kinase kinase kinase that is distinct from Raf. This kinase, in turn, functions to activate MEK which subsequently stimulates both ERK and SOS phosphorylation. Currently, we are attempting to determine the nature of this osmotic shock regulated MAP kinase kinase kinase and the upstream effectors which mediate the osmotic shock activation of this kinase. We thank Diana Boeglin and Daniel Cahoy for excellent technical assistance."

Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence based on a wide range of methods such as electrophysiology (4.Simon S.M. Blobel G.

Although the environment of nascent translocating polypeptide chains has thus been quite well characterized, their conformation during passage through the ER translocase is not known. In mitochondria, it has been shown that nascent chains traverse the two mitochondrial membranes in a largely extended conformation(9.Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). endoplasmic reticulum oligosaccharyl transferase polymerase chain reaction signal recognition particle. Previously, we have found that the lumenally oriented active site of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) enzyme (itself part of the translocation complex; (10.Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar)), is positioned at a well defined distance above the surface of the ER membrane and can thus be used as a fixed point of reference against which the location of various parts of a nascent polypeptide in the translocase can be determined(11.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We now report measurements of the minimum length of polypeptide chain required to bridge the distance between the ribosomal peptidyl transferase site (P-site) on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane and the OST active site on the lumenal side. The minimum distance has been measured both for nascent chains corresponding to a globular protein domain that normally becomes fully translocated to the lumen of the ER and for nascent chains containing a hydrophobic stop-transfer sequence which interrupts translocation and ultimately becomes integrated into the lipid bilayer. Our results suggest that non-hydrophobic nascent chains may adopt a fully extended conformation during passage through the ribosome/translocase complex, whereas the hydrophobic stop transfer sequence appears to form a more compact, possibly helical, structure when located in the translocase. Unless otherwise stated, all enzymes as well as plasmid pGEM1 and wheat germ lysate were from Promega Biotech (Madison, WI). SP6 DNA polymerase, ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, dideoxyribonucleotides, and the cap analog m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G were from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Proteinase K was from Merck Sharpe and Dohme. [35S]Methionine was from Amersham Corp. Puromycin was from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Kebo Lab (Stockholm, Sweden). Insertion of the stop transfer sequence QQQL17VKKKK into the P2 domain of Lep was performed by introducing BclI and NdeI restriction sites in codons 214 and 220, respectively. Double-stranded oligonucleotides coding for the above amino acid sequence were then cloned between the BclI and NdeI restriction sites. Site-specific mutagenesis used to introduce an Asn-Ser-Thr glycosylation acceptor site in position 200 of Lep and to introduce restriction enzyme cleavage sites was performed according to the method of Kunkel(13.Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar), as modified by Geisselsoder et al.(14.Geisselsoder J. Witney F. Yuckenberg P. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 786-791Google Scholar). For cloning into and expression from the pGEM1 plasmid, the 5′ end of the lep gene was modified, first, by the introduction of an XbaI site, and second, by changing the context 5′ to the initiator ATG codon to a “Kozak consensus” sequence(15.Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5073-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus the 5′ region of the gene was modified to: … ATAACCCTCTAGAGCCACCATGGCGAATATG … (XbaI site and initiator codon underlined). Mutants of Lep made in phage M13 were cloned into pGEM1 behind the SP6 promoter as an XbaI-SmaI fragment. All constructs in pGEM1 were confirmed by sequencing of the plasmid DNA. Templates for in vitro transcription of truncated mRNA were prepared using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify fragments from pGEM1 plasmids containing the desired DNA constructs. The 5′ primer was the same for all PCR reactions and had the sequence 5′-TTCGTCCAACCAAACCGACTC-3′. This primer is situated 210 bases upstream of the translational start, and all amplified fragments thus contained the SP6 transcriptional promoter from pGEM1. The 3′ primers were chosen according to the positions of the truncations and were designed to have approximately the same annealing temperature as the 5′ primer. None of the 3′ primers contained translational stop codons. Amplification was performed with a total of 30 cycles using an annealing temperature of 59°C. The amplified DNA products were separated on a low melting-point agarose gel, excised, and purified using Wizard PCR purification resin (Promega) as described in the manufacturers protocol. Truncated mRNAs were transcribed from the SP6 promoter. The reaction mixture was as follows: 10 μl of 5 × Promega transcription buffer, 5 μl of 100 mM dithiothreitol, 2 μl of 25 mM ribonucleotide triphosphates (A, U, C, and G), 5 μl of 5 mM m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, 3.5 μl of H2O, 20 μl of DNA template, 2.5 μl (50 units) of RNasin, 2 μl (40 units) of SP6 RNA polymerase. Transcriptions were carried out at 37°C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by extracting with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) followed by extraction with chloroform. Samples were precipitated by the addition of NaCl to 50 mM and 2 volumes of ethanol. The precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at 4°C. The pellets were washed in 70% and then 99% ethanol and dried. The pellets were redissolved in 100 μl of H2O, and 5 μl were run on a 1% agarose gel to verify that the RNA band was at least 5-10 times more intense than the DNA template band. In vitro translation of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from the in vitro synthesized mRNA were carried out in 50-μl reactions using wheat germ extract according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Translation reactions were performed at 25°C for 1 h. When relevant, the translation mixes were supplemented with 1 μl (2 A280 equivalents) of EDTA-washed dog pancreas microsomes (16.Sakaguchi M. Tomiyoshi R. Kuroiwa T. Mihara K. Omura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17.Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and 1 μl of canine SRP (20 nM final concentration) prepared as described(18.Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For puromycin-treated samples, translation in the presence of microsomes and SRP was performed as above, followed by the addition of 2 μl of 30 mM puromycin and incubation at 25°C for another 10 min. At the end of the reaction, samples were acid precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid and then processed for immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antiserum against Lep. Gels were visualized on a Fuji BAS1000 phosphorimager and quantitated using the MacBas 2.1 software. Translation in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes was performed as described(19.Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of polypeptides to the lumenal side of the microsomes was assayed by resistance to exogenously added proteinase K and by prevention of N-linked glycosylation through competitive inhibition by addition of a glycosylation acceptor tripeptide (N-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-Thr-N-methylamide) as described(11.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A well characterized model protein (Lep) (Fig. 1), normally located in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli, was used to measure the number of residues required to bridge the distance between the P-site and the OST active site (the “minimum glycosylation length”). When expressed in vitro in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes, Lep inserts in an SRP-dependent manner with the same orientation as in E. coli, i.e. with both the N-terminal tail and the C-terminal P2 domain in the lumen (Refs. 11 and 20; data not shown). Lep is efficiently glycosylated on Asn214 when expressed as a full-length protein in the presence of microsomes(20.Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To measure the minimum glycosylation length, mRNAs truncated in the P2 domain of Lep at various defined positions C-terminal to the potential glycosylation acceptor site (Asn214-Ser-Thr) were generated by PCR and in vitro transcription. When translated in a wheat germ lysate expression system in the presence of SRP, the resulting truncated proteins (which do not contain a translational stop codon) remain bound to the ribosomal P-site at their C-terminal end (21.Gilmore R. Collins P. Johnson J. Kellaris K. Rapiejko P. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), while the more N-terminal parts of the P2 domain extend through the ribosome/translocase complex into the lumen of the ER. As shown in Fig. 2(panel B, lanes 1-3), when the truncation was 39 amino acid residues C-terminal to the acceptor site, no glycosylation was seen unless the nascent chain was released from the ribosome by treatment with puromycin, indicating that the protein had been correctly targeted to the ER membrane but did not extended sufficiently far from the P-site for the potential glycosylation site to reach the OST active site. Similar results were obtained for nascent chains truncated 51, 56, 61, 63, and 64 residues away from the potential glycosylation acceptor site (lanes 4-18). Finally, for truncations 65 and 66 residues away from the potential glycosylation acceptor site, a sharp increase in the amount of glycosylation in the absence of puromycin was observed (lanes 19-24). We conclude that a minimum of 65 amino acid residues is required to span the distance between the ribosomal P-site and the OST active site. Based on the results of a previous study where the number of residues between the lumenal end of a hydrophobic transmembrane segment and the OST active site was measured, we suggested that transmembrane segments may be lipid-exposed and have a helical conformation when located in the ER translocase(12.Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since the results reported above indicated that a nascent chain not containing any extensive hydrophobic stretches may traverse the translocase in an extended conformation (see “Discussion”), we considered the possibility that the minimum glycosylation length may be different if a hydrophobic segment is present in the nascent chain between the glycosylation acceptor site and the C terminus. We thus constructed a protein, Lep-ST (Fig. 3A), that contains an engineered glycosylation site Asn200-Ser-Thr replacing amino acids 200-202 and the stop-transfer sequence QQQL17VKKKK inserted between amino acid residues 215 and 220. When expressed in the presence of microsomes, Lep-ST was efficiently glycosylated on Asn200 (Fig. 3B, lane 2) and glycosylation was inhibited by inclusion of a glycosylation acceptor peptide (N-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-Thr-N-methylamide) in the reaction mixture (lane 3). A short fragment representing the glycosylated loop between the second transmembrane segment and the hydrophobic stop-transfer sequence was protected from proteinase K digestion (lanes 4 and 5), demonstrating that the topology of Lep-ST was as depicted in Fig. 3A. Truncations were made at different sites downstream of the stop-transfer segment, and glycosylation in the presence of microsomes was assayed as above. As shown in Fig. 4, for truncations 52, 66, and 69 residues away from the potential glycosylation acceptor site no glycosylation was seen in the absence of puromycin (lanes 1-9). For truncations 70 and 71 residues away from the potential glycosylation site, there was a sharp increase in the amount of glycosylation observed in the absence of puromycin (lanes 10-15), and complete glycosylation was observed when the truncation was 74 and 91 residues away (lanes 16-21). It thus appears that the presence of a long hydrophobic stretch makes the nascent chain spanning the translocase complex more compact. By measuring the minimum number of residues required to bridge the distance between the ribosomal P-site and the OST active site, we have sought to indirectly determine the conformation of a nascent chain in transit through the ER membrane. Our data show that a translocating nascent chain corresponding to a globular domain of a protein needs to be extended by a minimum of 65 amino acid residues from the P-site in the ribosome to be able to interact with the OST active site (Fig. 5). This length is increased to 71 residues when a 18-residue-long hydrophobic stop-transfer sequence is present in the nascent chain. These results are broadly consistent with previously reported data, but have a significantly higher precision. An early study provided a rough estimate of the P-site/OST distance of 45-95 residues(22.Glabe C.G. Hanover J.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that protease digestion of nascent secretory polypeptides in detergent permeabilized microsomes results in protected fragments of around 70 amino acid residues(23.Matlack K.E.S. Walter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6170-6180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and that photochemically induced cross-linking between a nascent chain and Sec61α is possible at a maximum distance of ~70 residues away from the ribosomal P-site(6.Mothes W. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3937-3982Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that disulfide bonds can form in a translocating nascent chain when it reaches a length of 50-60 residues(24.Bergman L. Kuehl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8869-8876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that at least 15 spacer amino acid residues are needed after the end of the hydrophobic core of a Nlumen-Ccyt-oriented transmembrane segment in order for a potential acceptor site for N-glycosylation to be glycosylated(11.Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, around 40 amino acid residues of a nascent chain are protected by free ribosomes from protease digestion (23.Matlack K.E.S. Walter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6170-6180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 25.Wang S. Sakai H. Wiedmann M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and photochemical cross-links to Sec61α can be seen at positions in a nascent chain only 30 residues away from the P-site(6.Mothes W. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3937-3982Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Taken at face value, these results together imply the geometrical relationships depicted in Fig. 6. However, depending on the dimensions of the putative ribosome/translocase channel and the conformational flexibility of the nascent chain, a precise match between the results of the different assays may not be expected. Electron microscopy studies of intact ribosomes suggest that nascent chains exit the large ribosomal subunit at a point ~150 Å from the P-site(26.Milligan R. Unwin P. Nature. 1986; 319: 693-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27.Bernabeua C. Tobin E. Fowler A. Zabin I. Lake J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28.Yonath A. Wittmann H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 329-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assuming a typical 50-Å-thick membrane, this gives a first-order approximation to the physical P-site/OST distance of ~200 Å, suggesting that the nascent chain must be able to bridge the distance between the ribosomal P-site and the OST active site in a largely extended conformation (~3.1 Å/residue, to be compared with 3.5 and 1.5 Å/residue in fully extended and α-helical conformations, respectively). Since these physical dimensions are only rough numbers, we cannot formally exclude that a short segment of the nascent chain is in fact helical, although we consider this unlikely. In agreement with the suggestion of an extended conformation, we find that the introduction of an 18-residue-long hydrophobic stop-transfer segment between the glycosylation acceptor site and the end of the nascent chain leads to an increase in the minimum glycosylation length of ~6 residues, suggesting a more compact conformation of the nascent chain. Since the hydrophobic segment is located only 19 residues downstream of the glycosylation acceptor site and since the acceptor site must be at least 17 residues away from the hydrophobic segment for glycosylation to be possible in this construct, ( 2I. Nilsson, H. Andersson, P. Whitley, G. von Heijne, manuscript in preparation.) the stop-transfer segment is located within the translocase complex in the critical constructs (truncations 69-74 residues away from the acceptor site). In the translocase, stop-transfer segments are believed to be in a partially lipid-exposed environment (12.Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29.Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and thus most likely in a helical conformation. Indeed, if 18 residues in a nascent chain were forced from a fully extended to an α-helical conformation, ~10 extra residues would need to be added to the chain in order to bridge a defined end-to-end distance. The 6-residue shift in the minimum glycosylation length that we observe is thus in reasonable agreement with an extended conformation for polar nascent chains and a helical conformation for hydrophobic segments. In summary, a model where the nascent polypeptide chains passes through a water-accessible translocase channel in a largely extended conformation is consistent with all the available data. Further, hydrophobic stop-transfer sequences appear to have a more compact, possibly helical conformation when located within the translocase, suggesting a more lipid-exposed environment.

https://openalex.org/W2013452351,"Several recent studies have demonstrated that Grb2, composed entirely of SH2 and SH3 domains, serves as an adaptor protein in tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Cbl, the protein product of c-cbl proto-oncogene, has been reported to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon T cell receptor (TCR) engagement. Here we show that in unstimulated Jurkat cells Cbl is co-immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against Grb2. However, in lymphocytes activated through the TCR, Cbl loses its ability to bind to Grb2 precipitated either with anti-Grb2 antibody or with an immobilized tyrosine phosphopeptide, Y1068-P, derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor. In vitro studies confirm that the ability of Cbl to bind to both SH3 domains of Grb2 is strongly reduced in activated T lymphocytes. Investigation of the time course of Cbl dissociation from Grb2 reveals that it is transient and correlates with the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. Moreover, Cbl is co-immunoprecipitated with Crk, another SH2/SH3 domain-containing protein, upon TCR stimulation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl binds exclusively to the SH2 domain of Crk.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 52-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein is identical with Shc adaptor protein(19.Ravichandran K. Lee K. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Burn P. Burakoff S. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The 75-kDa tyrosine kinase substrate, that has been recently cloned and referred to as SLP-76, interacts with the SH3 domains of Grb2(17.Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a 116-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein implicated in the TCR signaling pathway binds to the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2(18.Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Jackman J.N. Sun Q. Olson A.L. Findell P.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21608-21613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a 120-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein which in vitro binds to SH3 domains of Fyn, Lck, and Grb2, has been identified as Cbl(21.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The v-cbl oncogene is the transforming gene of the murine Cas NS-1 retrovirus which induces pre-B cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemias(22.Langdon W.Y. Hartley J.W. Klinken S.P. Ruscetti S.K. Morse H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1168-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The homologue of v-cbl in mammalian cells is the c-cbl proto-oncogene that encodes Cbl, a 120-kDa protein predominantly localized in the cytoplasm(23.Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo association of Nck, another SH2 and SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein with Cbl, was also demonstrated(24.Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we characterize the in vivo interaction of Cbl with two adaptor proteins, Grb2 and Crk. We report that, upon T cell activation, Cbl rapidly and transiently dissociates from Grb2. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl then binds to the SH2 domain of Crk. We provide evidence that Grb2 and Crk have a critical role in the regulation of Cbl proto-oncogene product. Jurkat cells were obtained from Cell Culture Bank of ICRF and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum. 5 × 106 cells were used per point (1 ml of lysis buffer) stimulated with 10 μg/ml monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody UCHT1. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 s and then lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml each of leupeptin, trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, and pepstatin A. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Anti-CD3 antibody UCHT1 was from D. A. Cantrell, ICRF. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal anti-Grb2 antibody immobilized on Sepharose beads and polyclonal anti-Cbl antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-GRF antibody was raised against a peptide corresponding to a region of the carboxyl-terminal domain (74-91) of GRF. Polyclonal anti-Crk antibody was generated against the first SH3 domain of Crk II. c-DNA encoding full-length GST fusion proteins c-Crk II and c-Crk II ΔSH2 (SH2-deleted mutant) were donated by Dr. H. Hanafusa(25.Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The SH2 fragment of c-Crk (amino-terminal 146 amino acids) was isolated by BamHI/BglII digestion of full-length c-Crk II and subsequent ligation into BamHI-digested pGEX2TK (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The GST fusion proteins encoding both SH3 domains of Grb2 have been described previously(17.Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Y1068 phosphopeptide derived from the autophosphorylated EGF receptor was synthesized with the sequence PVPEY(phos)INQS. The unphosphorylated peptide, PVPEYINQS, was also made(1.Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 15.Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously(15.Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose, then proteins were immunoprecipitated with either 10 μg of polyclonal anti-Grb2 antibody, or 5-5 μg of anti-Crk and anti-Cbl antibodies. All immunoprecipitating antibodies were cross-linked to protein A-agarose. Washing was performed with ice-cold 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM Na3VO4. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (in 7.5 and 12% gels), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham). For precipitation with GST fusion proteins, 4 μg of different Grb2 and Crk fusion proteins were used as noncovalently bound adducts to glutathione-agarose beads. Separation of bound proteins and immunoblotting were performed as described above. We have recently used an immobilized tyrosine phosphopeptide derived from the Y1068 autophosphorylation site of the EGF receptor, to precipitate the complex of Grb2 and Sos from the lysates of T lymphocytes(15.Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the phosphopeptide, Y1068-P binds to the SH2 domain of Grb2 with high affinity, whereas the SH3 domains of Grb2 are available for protein-protein interaction(1.Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 15.Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test if the phosphopeptide could precipitate proteins other than Sos in complex with Grb2, both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of Y1068 peptide immobilized on beads were incubated with lysates from untreated and TCR cross-linked Jurkat cells. Probing of Y1068-P precipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10, demonstrates that a 120-kDa phosphoprotein is present in the lysate of unstimulated cells (Fig. 1). Interestingly, upon T cell activation, the amount of this phosphoprotein is strongly decreased in the Y1068-P precipitate, while the appearance of a 75-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein was detected in the same precipitate. Immunoblotting with an antibody against the 120 kDa c-cbl proto-oncogene product shows the presence of Cbl in the Y1068-P precipitates from unstimulated cells and a decreased amount of Cbl in the precipitates from UCHT1-stimulated cells (Fig. 1). These data suggest that the 120-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein observed in our experiment is identical with Cbl or at least Cbl is a component of the 120-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein band. The Y1068-P phosphopeptide precipitates equal amounts of Grb2 from either unstimulated or activated T lymphocytes(15.Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the decreased amount of Cbl in the precipitates indicates that the association of Grb2 with Cbl is strongly inhibited in the lysates of activated cells. Identical results were obtained using human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts (data not shown). It is noteworthy that while Cbl disappeared from the Grb2 complex, in the 4G10 blot a relatively large amount of a 120-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein still bound to Grb2 even in stimulated cells. It is likely that another tyrosine phosphoprotein exists in stimulated T cells with a molecular mass of 115-120 kDa. Analysis of the partial amino acid sequence of an unidentified 116-kDa phosphoprotein, that can also bind to Grb2, suggests that it is different from Cbl(20.Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To prove the interaction of Grb2 with Cbl in another experimental system, immunoprecipitations with anti-Grb2 antibody covalently bound to Sepharose beads were performed. Jurkat cells were stimulated with UCHT1 antibody for 2 min or left untreated, proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2, and then probed with anti-Cbl antibody. Fig. 2 demonstrates that in the lysate of resting cells Cbl co-immunoprecipitates with Grb2. In contrast, in the lysate of activated cells, Cbl is not associated with Grb2. Immunoblotting of whole cell lysates from quiescent or activated T cells with anti-Cbl antibody shows equal quantities of immunoreactive bands (Fig. 2). This excludes the possibility that the disappearance of Cbl from the Grb2 immunoprecipitates is due to the proteolytic degradation of the protein. For control immunoprecipitates, an antipeptide antibody raised against the guanine nucleotide releasing factor (GRF) that is exclusively present in neuron cells was used (Fig. 2)(26.Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Faig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). T cell stimulation results in a rapid and significant phosphorylation of Cbl detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody(21.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Donovan et al.(21.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated Cbl phosphorylation only in whole cell lysates of Jurkat cells. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated Cbl and then performed immunoblotting with 4G10. Fig. 3 demonstrates that Cbl has a certain level of basal phosphorylation in quiescent cells. However, in response to TCR activation, Cbl is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Maximal phosphorylation is seen after 5 min of stimulation, with a reduction to background levels by 45 min. We also investigated the kinetics of Cbl dissociation from Grb2 upon T cell activation. Jurkat cells were treated with UCHT1 antibody for 0, 5, 15, and 45 min; then Cbl was immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 antibody. Fig. 4 shows that after 5 min of stimulation Cbl is not co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2. However, after 15 min of UCHT1 treatment, the amount of Cbl is slightly increased in the Grb2 immunoprecipitate and returns to the level seen in unstimulated cells after 45 min. These data demonstrate a marked correlation between the kinetics of Cbl phosphorylation (Fig. 3) and the kinetics of dissociation of Cbl from Grb2 (Fig. 4A). To ensure that the loss of Cbl from Grb2 immunoprecipitates is not an artifact due to different amounts of Grb2 present in the immunocomplexes, Grb2 immunoprecipitates with monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody were probed. The result clearly demonstrates that Grb2 precipitates contain equal immunoreactive bands (Fig. 4B). Grb2 was not found to undergo any phosphorylation on either tyrosine or serine/threonine residues in T lymphocytes activated via their TCR(15.Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the inability of phosphorylated Cbl to bind to Grb2 in T cells activated for a short time is due to conformational changes in the structure of Cbl upon increased tyrosine phosphorylation, although at present definitive proof of this hypothesis is not available. It has been reported that only the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 can bind Cbl(21.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the in vitro binding of Cbl to GST fusion proteins of Grb2. Lysates of quiescent and activated Jurkat cells were mixed with both SH3 domains of GST-Grb2 immobilized on beads, and then protein precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Cbl antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, both SH3 domains are able to bind to Cbl in lysates of unstimulated cells, although based on our several experiments, Cbl has an in vitro preference for the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. In addition, Fig. 5 demonstrates that in UCHT1-treated cells the amount of Cbl associated with both SH3 domains of Grb2 is decreased. Donovan et al.(21.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also reported that the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 binds less Cbl from the lysate of vanadate-treated Jurkat cells than from the lysate of unstimulated cells(21.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that in activated Jurkat cells the affinity of tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl for the SH3 domains of Grb2 is strongly reduced (Fig. 5). It has been reported recently that Crk adaptor proteins associate via their SH2 domain with a tyrosine-phosphorylated 116-kDa protein and thus implicated in TCR signaling(27.Sawasdikosol S. Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Chang J.H. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2893-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One of the possible candidate proteins of this size is Cbl. Therefore, we probed immunoprecipitates of Crk with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10, and anti-Cbl. As shown in Fig. 6, although some amount of Cbl is co-immunoprecipitated with Crk from the lysates of unstimulated cells, activation of Jurkat cells induces increased complex formation of Cbl with Crk. Immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody confirms the increased association of Crk with the 120-kDa phosphoprotein (Fig. 6). Using different GST fusion proteins of Crk II, we have investigated which domain of Crk II interacts with Cbl. Lysates of unstimulated and activated Jurkat cells were mixed with fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, and then protein precipitates were probed with anti-Cbl antibody. Consistent with the in vivo data, the full-length Crk II protein was able to precipitate a small amount of Cbl from unstimulated cells. Following TCR activation, we could detect an increased association of Crk II GST fusion protein with Cbl (Fig. 7). The SH2 domain of Crk interacted in a manner similar to the full-length protein with Cbl. Although we added equal amounts (4 μg) of GST fusion proteins to cell lysates, the experiment shows that in activated cells the SH2 domain alone can bind more Cbl than the full-length protein. The affinity of the single SH2 domain of Crk for Cbl could be higher than that of the full-length Crk. Finally, the SH2-deleted Crk II fusion protein (ΔSH2) was unable to bind to Cbl either from the lysate of activated or unstimulated T cells (Fig. 7). Using full-length GST protein of Crk-L, we have detected inducible association of Crk-L with Cbl upon T cell activation (data not shown), suggesting that all members of the Crk family are able to form complexes with Cbl via their SH2 domains.Figure 7:Crk SH2 domain interacts with Cbl from activated T cell lysates. T cells were activated with UCHT1 antibody for 2 min. GST, GST-Crk II, GST-Crk SH2, and GST-Crk II SH2 mutant fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were added to cell lysates. Proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-7.5% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-Cbl antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cbl, the protein product of the c-cbl proto-oncogene, has recently been implicated in several tyrosine kinase signaling pathways(21.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Tanaka S. Neff L. Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Cbl can bind to two adaptor proteins, Grb2 and Nck, via their SH3 domains in T lymphocytes and HL60 cells, respectively(21.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Sameshima J.H. Marcilla A. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17363-17366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with these reports in that Cbl associates with Grb2 in unstimulated T cells in vitro and in vivo, in an SH3 domain-dependent manner. However, upon CD3 activation of Jurkat cells, Cbl rapidly and transiently dissociates from Grb2 (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 4A). Agonist-induced dissociation of a proline-rich domain-containing protein from Grb2 has not previously been reported for any protein in any cell type. Donovan et al.(21.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Cbl undergoes a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in response to TCR stimulation. We have demonstrated that the kinetics of Cbl phosphorylation correlate remarkably with the kinetics of Grb2/Cbl dissociation. The mechanism by which Cbl dissociates from Grb2 upon T cell activation is unknown but may relate to tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. Phosphorylation of Sos exchange protein on serine/threonine residues has been reported (30.Cherniak A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) to result in the disassembly of Sos from Grb2. This finding suggests that conformational changes in the structure of a proline-rich domain-containing protein due to phosphorylation may cause its dissociation from Grb2. In the case of Sos phosphorylation either in fibroblasts or in T cells, this mechanism seems to be involved in the negative feedback regulation of Ras signaling pathway(30.Cherniak A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1485-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

By contrast, we show here that a TCR agonist induces a rapid and transient phosphorylation of Cbl and its dissociation from Grb2. Therefore, functionally the dissociation of Cbl from Grb2 is completely different from the disassembly of Sos from Grb2. While this manuscript was in preparation, association of Cbl with Grb2 and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase in Jurkat cells has been reported (33.Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartey D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In contrast with our results, Cbl and Grb2 have been shown to form a constitutive complex regardless of the activation state of Jurkat cells. One possible explanation is that we stimulated the cells via their TCR, while Meisner et al.(33.Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartey D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) used co-stimulation of the TCR and CD4 receptors. Cross-linking of both the TCR and CD4 receptors may result in a more intensive phosphorylation of Cbl, or alternatively, phosphorylation may occur on different sites. Based on in vitro data with SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 GST fusion proteins, tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl can bind to both SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 in fully activated cells(33.Meisner H. Conway B.R. Hartey D. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3571-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In CD3-activated Jurkat cells, we have not detected binding of Cbl to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (data not shown). In addition, we show that tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl binds to another SH2/SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein, Crk, via its SH2 domain. Sawasdikosol et al.(27.Sawasdikosol S. Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Chang J.H. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2893-2896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have reported that in activated T lymphocytes a phosphotyrosine protein with a molecular mass of 116 kDa binds to the SH2 domain of Crk. Therefore, it is highly likely that this 116-kDa phosphotyrosine protein is identical with Cbl. Using SH2 mutant Crk for protein precipitation, we failed to detect the association of Cbl with the Crk SH3 domains. This suggests that the mechanism by which Cbl binds to Crk is completely different from the association of Cbl with Grb2 and Nck. At present, the role of Crk in regulation of Cbl is unclear. Two other phosphotyrosine proteins have been shown to be associated with Crk, in a similar SH2-dependent manner, paxillin and the Crk-associated substrate p130CAS(11.Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 12.Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Reichman C. Shoelson S.E. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In addition, Crk proteins can be associated, via their SH3 domains, with two Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange proteins, Sos and C3G(8.Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 9.ten Hoeve J.

Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylated Cbl in complex with Crk/Sos or Crk/C3G might be involved in Ras signaling pathways in T cells. It has been suggested that Cbl is a nuclear protein which may function as a transcripton factor(23.Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) : it contains a possible nuclear localization sequence, a putative leucine zipper at the carboxyl terminus, and a zinc finger-related protein motif(29.Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cbl or tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl could be transported into the nucleus. This is supported by the fact that the truncated form of Cbl, the protein product of v-cbl oncogene, can enter the nucleus and bind DNA(23.Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been recently suggested that the carboxyl terminus of Cbl is involved in the retention of Cbl in the cytoplasm and the inhibition of DNA binding(23.Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The truncation in the sequence of v-Cbl occurs at the carboxyl-terminal domain which contains several proline-rich motifs. These motifs are likely to be responsible for the interaction with the SH3 domains of Grb2. Taken together, this suggests that Grb2 might have a role in the regulation of Cbl in quiescent cells by acting as a retention factor. However, every effort so far to detect Cbl in the nucleus has been unsuccessful. Tanaka et al.(28.Tanaka S. Neff L. Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) have very recently reported that in macrophages stimulated via their Fcγ receptor or in HER14 cells activated with EGF, Cbl was found to translocate from the cytoplasm to the trans-Golgi region of the cells.

Six separate inhibitors of tyrosine kinase each inhibited 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid formation by HL-60 cells stimulated with calcium ionophore, in the presence or absence of exogenous arachidonic acid substrate, indicating that they modulated cellular 5-lipoxygenase activity. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors also blocked the translocation of 5-lipoxygenase from cytosol to membranes during cellular activation, consistent with their effects on its catalytic activity. These results fit a model which postulates that Src homology domain interactions are a molecular determinant of the processes which coordinate the subcellular localization and functions of 5-lipoxygenase. In addition, we demonstrate that activated leukocytes contain two molecularly distinct forms of 5-lipoxygenase: a phosphorylated form and a nonphosphorylated form. In activated HL-60 cells the pool of phosphorylated 5-lipoxygenase accumulates in the nuclear fraction, not with the membrane or cytosolic fractions. The amount of phosphorylated 5-lipoxygenase is a small fraction of the total. Overall, equilibrium reactions involving the nuclear localizing sequence, the proline-rich SH3 binding motif, and the phosphorylation state of 5-lipoxygenase may each influence its partnership with other cellular proteins and any novel functions derived from such partnerships.

We now report that exposure of platelets to PKC-activating β-phorbol myristate acetate (βPMA) does not stimulate PI 3-Kγ, but rather stimulates p85/PI 3-K, which associates with the cytoskeleton. Wortmannin is an inhibitor of both PI 3-Ks, known to act with more potency on p85/PI 3-K. βPMA-stimulated 3-PPI accumulation is more sensitive to wortmannin (IC50 = 1.3 nM) than is SFLLRN- or thrombin-stimulated 3-PPI accumulation (IC50 = 10 nM). The activity of p85/PI 3-K in immunoprecipitates or in cytoskeletal fractions is inhibited more potently by exposure of platelets to wortmannin than is the activity of PI 3-Kγ. βPMA or SFLLRN promotes the conversion of platelet integrin αIIbβ3 into a fibrinogen-binding form required for platelet aggregation. Activation of αIIbβ3 in response to βPMA or SFLLRN is inhibited by wortmannin with an IC50 of 1 nM in each case. Wortmannin inhibits neither activation of αIIbβ3 by ligand-induced binding site antibody (anti-LIBS6 Fab) nor anti-LIBS6 Fab-induced platelet aggregation in the presence of fibrinogen, indicating that this type of “outside-in” signaling by αIIbβ3 is largely PI 3-K-independent.

To determine the mechanism of action of cryptophycin, its effects on tubulin function in vitro were analyzed. Cryptophycin reduced the in vitro polymerization of bovine brain microtubules by 50% at a drug:tubulin ratio of 0.1. Cryptophycin did not alter the critical concentration of tubulin required for polymerization, but instead caused substoichiometric reductions in the amount of tubulin that was competent for assembly. Consistent with its persistent effects on intact cells, cryptophycin-treated microtubule protein remained polymerization-defective even after cryptophycin was reduced to sub-inhibitory concentrations. The effects of cryptophycin were not due to denaturation of tubulin and were associated with the accumulation of rings of microtubule protein.The site of cryptophycin interaction with tubulin was examined using functional and competitive binding assays. Cryptophycin blocked the formation of vinblastine-tubulin paracrystals in intact cells and suppressed vinblastine-induced tubulin aggregation in vitro. Cryptophycin inhibited the binding of [3H]vinblastine and the hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP by isolated tubulin, but did not block the binding of colchicine.

Microtubules are extraordinarily dynamic assemblies, which are involved in many cellular activities including maintenance of cell structure and regulation of cell motility, membrane transport processes and cell proliferation (reviewed in (1.Cleveland D.W. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 101-105Google Scholar)). The process of continuous addition and loss of tubulin dimers from microtubule ends, termed dynamic instability(2.Mitchison T. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar), allows rapid remodeling of these structures, but also makes them susceptible to chemical agents that disrupt microtubule structure and function. Inhibition of microtubule dynamics in the mitotic spindle is thought to be the basis for the anticancer activities of drugs that promote the depolymerization of microtubules, e.g. Vinca alkaloids, or that stabilize microtubules, e.g. taxanes(3.Rowinsky E.K.

These compounds are widely used clinically; however, the ability of tumor cells to develop resistance to these, and most other, natural product anticancer drugs often limits their ultimate efficacy (reviewed in (8.Endicott J.A.

We have recently described the ability of a cyanobacterial cytotoxic macrolide, termed cryptophycin, to induce the depletion of microtubules in intact cells(11.Smith C.D. Zhang X. Mooberry S.L. Patterson G.M.L. Moore R.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3779-3785PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, cryptophycin is able to circumvent a common form of multiple drug resistance, i.e. P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of natural product anticancer drugs. This confers a significant theoretical advantage to this compound over currently utilized antimitotic drugs in that tumors should be less able to develop resistance to cryptophycin. Cryptophycin has demonstrated excellent in vivo activity against several types of tumor xenografts, including those of cells that are poorly inhibited by Vinca alkaloids(12.Trimurtulu G. Ohtani I.

Because of the potential usefulness of cryptophycin as an anticancer drug, we have now examined the molecular mechanism of its antimicrotubule actions. These studies have revealed that cryptophycin interacts with the Vinca alkaloid binding domain of tubulin; however, a number of unique molecular details of cryptophycin binding have been identified.

[3H]Colchicine (67 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol), and [3H]thymidine (20 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN; [3H]vinblastine (9 Ci/mmol) was from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA). Bovine brains were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and kept at 4°C for approximately 1 h before cleaning and homogenization. Microtubule protein (MTP) ( 1The abbreviations used are: MTPmicrotubule protein (consisting of tubulin and MAPs)bisANSbis(8-anilinonaphthalene 1-sulfonate)MAPmicrotubule-associated proteinMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid.) was isolated by two cycles of polymerization-depolymerization as described by Vallee (15.Vallee R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and consisted of approximately 75% tubulin and 25% microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), as estimated by Coommassie Brilliant Blue staining of MTP after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown).

In the standard polymerization assay (17.Bai R. Pettit G.R. Hamel E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), samples (0.25 ml) containing 2.5 mg of MTP/ml (20 μM tubulin) in MTP polymerizing buffer (0.1 M MES, pH 6.4, containing 0.5 mM MgCl2) were incubated with drug at 4°C for 15 min before the addition of 0.5 mM GTP. The samples were then rapidly warmed to 37°C in a water-jacketed cuvette holder of a Pharmacia Ultraspec III spectrophotometer, and the absorbance at 350 nm was monitored for approximately 30 min. For studies with purified tubulin, 0.25-ml samples containing 2 mg of tubulin/ml (20 μM) in 1 M glutamate, pH 6.6, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 4% dimethyl sulfoxide, and drug were incubated at 4°C for 15 min. Tubulin polymerization was initiated and monitored as indicated above. The following variations of this polymerization assay were used in certain studies. 1) To examine the effects of drugs on microtubule depolymerization, MTP was polymerized in the absence or presence of 10 μM paclitaxel for 30 min under the conditions described above. Cryptophycin or vinblastine was then added, and the A350 was monitored for approximately 30 min. 2) To examine the effects of drugs on microtubule morphology, MTP samples were incubated with drug under polymerizing conditions for 30 min. The samples were then fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde, absorbed onto carbon-coated grids, and stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate for electron microscopy. 3) To test the effects of cryptophycin on the critical concentration of tubulin, the amount of MTP was varied from 0.25 to 5 mg/ml (2-40 μM tubulin) and cryptophycin concentrations were varied from 0 to 10 μM. Polymerization was initiated and monitored as indicated above. 4) To test the reversibility of the inhibitory effect of cryptophycin, MTP was incubated with 5 μM cryptophycin for 30 min at room temperature in MTP polymerizing buffer (without GTP). The samples were then diluted 10-fold with cold MTP polymerizing buffer and concentrated 10-80-fold by ultrafiltration using Centricon-10 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA), which contain Mr 10,000 cut-off filters. After measurement of the volume of the concentrate, the samples were diluted to their original volume (0.25 ml) so that the MTP was restored to its original concentration and cryptophycin was reduced to ≤0.5 μM. A 0.2-ml aliquot was then combined with 0.5 mM GTP and warmed to 37°C, and polymerization was monitored as indicated above. The remainder of the sample was combined with 9 volumes of cold EtOH, and precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was serially diluted and tested for cytotoxicity toward MCF-7 cells as described previously (11.Smith C.D. Zhang X. Mooberry S.L. Patterson G.M.L. Moore R.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3779-3785PubMed Google Scholar). The actual amount of cryptophycin in each centrifuged sample was determined by comparison with the cytotoxicities of cryptophycin standards. The ability of cryptophycin to interact with tubulin was also examined by determining its ability to modulate the binding of colchicine, [3H]vinblastine, [3H]GTP, and bisANS, and the hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP according to the following protocols. 1) In the colchicine binding assay(18.Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), triplicate samples of bovine brain MTP (10 μM tubulin) were incubated with cryptophycin, podophyllotoxin or vinblastine in 0.1 M MES, pH 6.6, containing 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM GTP, 100 mM glucose 1-phosphate(19.Borisy G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 13: 373-385Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar), for 5 min before the addition of 10 μM colchicine. After 30 min, the fluorescence of the MTP mixture were determined using an excitation wavelength of 357 nm and an emission wavelength of 435 nm. Increased fluorescence of colchicine is observed upon its binding to tubulin (18.Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Samples without colchicine or without MTP were utilized as blanks. 2) In the [3H]vinblastine binding assay(20.Bai R. Pettit G.R.

The samples (0.15 ml) were then applied to 0.5-ml columns of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with incubation buffer without vinblastine and centrifuged at 100 × g for 2 min. Additional buffer (0.3 ml) was then added to each column, and the samples were centrifuged again. An aliquot of the filtrate (0.25 ml) containing bound [3H]vinblastine was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Blank samples did not contain MTP, and their counts were subtracted from test samples. 3) In the [3H]GTP binding assay, triplicate samples of MTP (20 μM tubulin) were incubated in 0.1 M MES, pH 6.9, containing 0.5 mM MgCl2, 2% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.1 mM [3H]GTP (0.2 μCi) with several concentrations of test drugs for 30 min at 21°C. Bound [3H]GTP was determined by centrifugal filtration on Sephadex G-50 as described above. Blank samples did not contain MTP, and their counts were subtracted from test samples. 4) In the GTPase assay(21.Heusele C. Carlier M.-F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), triplicate samples of 20 μM purified tubulin were incubated in 1 M glutamate, pH 6.9, containing 0.5 mM MgCl2, 2% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.1 mM [γ-32P]GTP (0.1 μCi) (22.Hamel E. Lin C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11060-11069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with several concentrations of test drugs for 5 min at 37°C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 300 mM perchloric acid containing 10 mg of activated charcoal (23.Smith C.D. Wells W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11890-11894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were then incubated at room temperature for 5 min to allow adsorption of the nucleotide to the charcoal, followed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. An aliquot (0.25 ml) of the supernatant was removed and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to determine the amount of released 32PO4. Blank samples did not contain MTP, or were stopped immediately after the addition of [γ-32P]GTP, and their counts were subtracted from test samples. 5) To quantify the rates of tubulin denaturation(24.Prasad A.R.S. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), purified tubulin (5 μM) was incubated at 37°C in 100 mM MES, pH 6.4, containing 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM GTP, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol in the absence or presence of cryptophycin. At 30-min intervals, samples were combined with 25 μM bisANS and the fluorescence was determined using an excitation wavelength of 385 nm and an emission wavelength of 490 nm (24.Prasad A.R.S. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Samples without bisANS or without tubulin were utilized as blanks. Human ovarian carcinoma cells (SKOV3) were grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously(25.Smith C.D. Mooberry S.L. Zhang X. Helt A.-M. Cancer Lett. 1994; 79: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with the indicated concentration of cryptophycin, colchicine, or rhizoxin for 3 h (which is sufficient to cause complete loss of microtubules) and then exposed to 5 μM vinblastine for 18 h. Cells were fixed with cold methanol and stained with an anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody, followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as described previously(11.Smith C.D. Zhang X. Mooberry S.L. Patterson G.M.L. Moore R.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3779-3785PubMed Google Scholar). Images were collected by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 6000) and processed using Voxel View(™) software. Similar to the procedure of Uppuluri et al.(26.Uppuluri S. Knipling L. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), MTP (10 μM tubulin) was incubated in the dark for 15 min with 2 μM [3H]colchicine (2 μCi/assay) in the buffer utilized for the colchicine binding experiments in flat-bottomed polystyrene microtiter plates. The plates were then exposed to 365 nm light at 1 milliwatt/cm2 for 10 min. MTP samples were then dissolved in Tris/glycine loading buffer and were electrophoresed on 10-20% gradient gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The gel was then soaked in Amplify (Amersham Corp.), dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm-MP x-ray film for up to 14 days, as necessary. Band intensities on the fluorograms were quantified using the program NIH-Image. To test the effects of drugs on topoisomerase II-mediated cleavage of supercoiled pBR322, 0.6 μg of the plasmid was incubated alone or in the presence of 20 units of calf thymus topoisomerase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) for 40 min at 30°C. Reactions were conducted in the presence of EtOH (as a solvent control), 10 μM amsacrine, 10 μM cryptophycin, or 50 μM camptothecin. Samples were then electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel (Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.9) and stained with ethidium bromide for visualization of DNA. Additionally, the K+/SDS precipitation assay was used to test the effects of drugs on topoisomerases in intact cells(27.van der Graaf W.T.A. de Vries E.G.E. Timmer-Bosscha H. Meersma G.J. Mesander G. Vellenga E. Mulder N.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5368-5373PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, SKOV3 cells were grown for 24 h in the presence of [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) in 24-well tissue culture plates. At that time, the medium was replaced with unlabeled medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cells were exposed to multiple doses of test drugs for 45 min. The cells were then lysed with 1.25% SDS, and protein-complexed DNA was precipitated by the addition of 325 mM KCl. Pellets were washed twice, and the amount of precipitated 3H was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The effects of equal concentrations of colchicine, vinblastine and cryptophycin on the in vitro assembly of MTP are demonstrated in Fig. 2. Microtubule assembly from MTP was inhibited by approximately 50% by 5 μM colchicine, while this concentration of vinblastine and cryptophycin strongly reduced microtubule polymerization. The initial rate of microtubule assembly was unaffected by 5 μM colchicine, most likely reflecting the relatively slow binding of this drug(4.Hamel E. Avila J. Microtubule Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 89-191Google Scholar). In contrast, both vinblastine and cryptophycin suppressed the rate as well as the extent of microtubule assembly. Substoichiometric doses of cryptophycin (with respect to tubulin) suppressed microtubule assembly (Fig. 3A), such that polymerization was decreased by approximately 50% by a cryptophycin:tubulin ratio of 0.1. Cryptophycin concentrations of 0.5 μM and below did not affect microtubule assembly. In contrast with vinblastine(4.Hamel E. Avila J. Microtubule Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 89-191Google Scholar), high doses of cryptophycin (up to at least 40 μM) did not promote the formation of aberrant tubulin aggregations that result in increased light scattering (data not shown). Cryptophycin also suppressed the ability of purified tubulin to assemble into microtubules (Fig. 3B), indicating that the molecular target of the compound is tubulin rather than a MAP. To examine the polymerization of tubulin in the absence of MAPs, it is necessary to utilize reaction conditions which strongly promote microtubule assembly, i.e. 1 M glutamate, pH 6.6, containing 4% dimethyl sulfoxide(4.Hamel E. Avila J. Microtubule Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 89-191Google Scholar). The reduced effect of cryptophycin on purified tubulin most likely reflects the difficulty in blocking assembly under these conditions. Experiments in which the concentrations of both tubulin and cryptophycin were varied indicated that the compound altered the percentage of tubulin which was competent for assembly, but did not alter the critical concentration of tubulin required for assembly (Fig. 4). These effects of cryptophycin are clearly substoichiometric with respect to tubulin, e.g. increasing tubulin from 10 to 40 μM allowed only a small increase in assembly in the presence of 5 μM cryptophycin. Electron microscopy revealed that MTP incubated with cryptophycin accumulated as rings (Fig. 5). The scattered aggregates of protein do not have structural similarity with spirals formed in the presence of vinblastine ((28.Himes R.C. Kersey R.N. Heller-Bettinger I. Samson F.E. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 3798-3802PubMed Google Scholar) and data not shown). Pretreatment of intact cells with paclitaxel prevents microtubule depletion upon exposure to cryptophycin or vinblastine(11.Smith C.D. Zhang X. Mooberry S.L. Patterson G.M.L. Moore R.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3779-3785PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effects of paclitaxel in vitro, microtubules were assembled in the absence or presence of 10 μM paclitaxel and then exposed to cryptophycin or vinblastine. As demonstrated in Fig. 6, addition of cryptophycin to microtubules assembled in the absence of paclitaxel led to rapid, partial disassembly, manifested as a decrease in turbidity. In contrast, vinblastine was ineffective in reducing the state of microtubule assembly. Paclitaxel enhanced microtubule assembly, in agreement with previous studies(29.Schiff P.B. Fant J. Horwitz S.B. Nature. 1979; 277: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (2999) Google Scholar), and markedly reduced the ability of cryptophycin to induce disassembly. Treatment of cells with cryptophycin results in irreversible depletion of microtubules(11.Smith C.D. Zhang X. Mooberry S.L. Patterson G.M.L. Moore R.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3779-3785PubMed Google Scholar). To test the reversibility of the in vitro effects of the compound, MTP was treated with 5 μM cryptophycin, concentrated 10- or 30-fold by ultrafiltration, and then diluted to the original volume. Residual concentrations of cryptophycin in the MTP sample were quantified by a bioassay for cytotoxicity and were found to amount to 0.16 and 0.085 μM. Results from six samples indicated that actual residual cryptophycin concentrations averaged 48 ± 8% of the theoretical residual concentration, i.e. calculated on the basis of the dilution factor, suggesting limited binding to the concentrator. The polymerization ability of MTP incubated in the absence of cryptophycin was reduced by approximately 50% by these manipulations. However, MTP that had been incubated with cryptophycin was unable to assemble (Fig. 7), even when residual levels of cryptophycin were reduced to 0.085 μM. This concentration of cryptophycin has no effect on MTP assembly, indicating that treatment with cryptophycin caused persistent inhibition of assembly. Incubation of tubulin at 37°C results in time-dependent denaturation that can be monitored as increased binding of bisANS to hydrophobic sites(24.Prasad A.R.S. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 739-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cryptophycin (5 μM or greater) completely blocked the spontaneous increase in the ability of tubulin to bind bisANS (data not shown). This stabilization of tubulin supports the hypothesis that cryptophycin binds directly to tubulin and indicates that the persistence of the inhibitory effect of cryptophycin of polymerization is not due to nonspecific denaturation of tubulin. Interaction of cryptophycin with the colchicine and Vinca alkaloid domains of tubulin was assessed by determining its ability to compete with colchicine and [3H]vinblastine binding, respectively. As indicated by Fig. 8A, cryptophycin, rhizoxin, and vinblastine were essentially equally efficient at inhibiting [3H]vinblastine binding to MTP, indicating that cryptophycin interacts with the Vinca domain of tubulin with high affinity. Neither colchicine nor podophyllotoxin reduced binding of [3H]vinblastine, showing that occupancy of the colchicine binding site does not modulate the Vinca binding site. In these experiments, the stoichiometry of [3H]vinblastine binding was >0.75, with respect to tubulin dimer. Colchicine binding to tubulin can be monitored by an increase in its fluorescence at 435 nm(18.Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of MTP with podophyllotoxin strongly reduced colchicine binding, whereas neither vinblastine nor cryptophycin altered the increased fluorescence of colchicine upon its interaction with tubulin (Fig. 8B). Cryptophycin alone did not alter fluorescence at 435 nm (open triangles), or the absorption spectrum of the MTP (data not shown). In a complimentary assay, the effects of these agents on the photolabeling of tubulin by [3H]colchicine (26.Uppuluri S. Knipling L. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) were determined. Covalent incorporation of [3H]colchicine into tubulin dimers upon exposure to UV light was inhibited by pretreatment of the MTP with 20 μM of either podophyllotoxin or unlabeled colchicine (to 57 and 51% of the control value, respectively). In contrast, pretreatment with 20 μM vinblastine or rhizoxin did not have reduce the photolabeling of tubulin by [3H]colchicine, and cryptophycin reduced labeling to only 79% of the control value. Cryptophycin and vinblastine caused virtually parallel dose-dependent inhibitions of the hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP by purified tubulin, each reaching 10% of the control activity at 10 μM (data not shown). Neither cryptophycin nor vinblastine altered [3H]GTP binding to MTP (data not shown). To verify the ability of cryptophycin to modulate the Vinca binding domain of tubulin, its effects on the formation of vinblastine-tubulin paracrystals in intact cells were examined. Treatment of ovarian carcinoma (SKOV3) cells with 5 μM vinblastine resulted in the depletion of microtubules and the formation of large paracrystals of vinblastine-tubulin (Fig. 9). Treatment of cells with 5 μM colchicine, 5 μM rhizoxin, or 25 nM cryptophycin depleted microtubules, resulting in diffuse cytoplasmic staining of β-tubulin. Addition of vinblastine to colchicine-treated cells resulted in the formation of paracrystals; however, no paracrystals were formed in cells pretreated with either rhizoxin or cryptophycin. Similarly, pretreatment of MTP in vitro with 10 μM cryptophycin blocked the ability of high doses of vinblastine (up to at least 80 μM) to cause tubulin aggregation (data not shown). Since several antimitotic agents are cytotoxic through inhibition of topoisomerases, we directly tested the effects of cryptophycin on topoisomerases in vitro and in intact cells. In vitro cleavage of supercoiled plasmid pBR322 by topoisomerase II was blocked by 10 μM amsacrine, whereas 10 μM cryptophycin and 50 μM camptothecin did not inhibit topoisomerase II activity (data not shown). Inhibition of topoisomerases in intact cells is associated with the accumulation of “cleavable complexes” consisting of drug, topoisomerase, and DNA which can be easily monitored in [3H]thymidine-labeled cells. Treatment of [3H]thymidine-labeled SKOV3 cells with 50 μM etoposide or 5 μM camptothecin caused approximately 5-fold increases in the amount of K+/SDS-precipitable [3H]DNA, whereas exposure of the cells to cryptophycin up to at least 10 μM did not elevate the levels of [3H]DNA-protein cross-links (data not shown). The doses of cryptophycin used in these experiments was approximately 106 times the IC50 for the cells, indicating that the cytotoxic effects are not mediated by inhibition of a topoisomerase. Our initial descriptions of the actions of cryptophycin were limited to cellular studies in which this cyanobacterial natural product demonstrated extremely potent cytotoxicity, which was closely correlated with mitotic arrest, and pronounced, irreversible depletion of cellular microtubules(11.Smith C.D. Zhang X. Mooberry S.L. Patterson G.M.L. Moore R.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3779-3785PubMed Google Scholar). A"

https://openalex.org/W2002915668,"We have recently shown that a four-amino acid epitope (VTIL) on the m2 muscarinic receptor (corresponding to Val385, Thr386, Ile389, and Leu390) is essential for Gi/o coupling specificity and Gi/o activation (Liu, J., Conklin, B. R., Blin, N., Yun, J., and Wess, J.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 11642-11646). Because this sequence element is thought to be located at the junction between the third intracellular loop and the sixth transmembrane helix (TM VI), we speculated that agonist binding to the m2 receptor protein results in conformational changes that enable the VTIL motif to interact with Gi/o proteins. To test the hypothesis that such structural changes might involve a relative movement of TM VI toward the cytoplasm, we created a series of mutant m2 muscarinic receptors in which one to four extra Ala residues were inserted into TM VI immediately after Leu390. Based on the geometry of an α-helix, such mutations are predicted to “push” the VTIL sequence away from the lipid bilayer. Consistent with our working hypothesis, second messenger assays with transfected COS-7 cells showed that all mutant m2 receptors containing extra Ala residues C-terminal of Leu390 could activate the proper G proteins even in the absence of agonist. However, replacement of the VTIL motif in such constitutively active m2 receptors with the corresponding m3 muscarinic receptor sequence (AALS) or deletion of Ala391 from the wild type m2 receptor completely abolished G protein coupling. Interestingly, introduction of extra Ala residues C-terminal of the AALS motif in the m3 muscarinic receptor completely abolished functional activity. Mutant m2 and m3 receptors that contained extra Ala residues immediately N-terminal of the VTIL and AALS motif, respectively, displayed wild type-like coupling properties.

https://openalex.org/W2044670939,"Heparin binding to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5) leads to a 17-fold decrease in its affinity for IGF-I, and a region that contains several basic amino acids (Arg201-Arg218) may be involved in this affinity shift. In the present study, mutagenesis was used to analyze the effect of substitutions for basic amino acids in the Arg201-Arg218 region of IGFBP-5 on heparin-binding and the heparin-induced affinity shift. Nine mutant forms were prepared. Their association constants (Ka) for IGF-I were similar to native IGFBP-5. When 10 μg/ml of heparin was added, the Ka of native IGFBP-5 decreased 17-fold, and the Ka of the K134A/R136A mutant decreased 16-fold. In contrast, substitutions for specific basic amino acids in the Arg201-Arg218 region decrease the affinity shift to 1.1-3.2-fold. Lys211 was especially important. When a mutant containing that single substitution was tested, heparin caused only a 2.5-fold reduction in IGF-I affinity. Affinity cross-linking studies showed that heparin was equipotent in inhibiting the formation of 125I-IGF-I•K134A/R136A mutant complexes compared to native IGFBP-5. In contrast, heparin had minimal effects on the formation of complexes between 125I-IGF-I and the other mutants. The heparin-binding activity of each mutant was determined. Four mutants, R201A/K202N, K202A/K206A/R207A, R201A/K202N/K206N/K208N, and K211N/R214A/K217A/R218A, had reduced heparin binding compared to native IGFBP-5. The other five mutants, including the K211N mutant, showed no change in heparin binding. The four mutants with reduced heparin binding could be dissociated from heparin-Sepharose with much lower NaCl concentrations, indicating that they had reduced affinity. These findings suggest that Arg201, Lys202, Lys206, and Arg214 are important for heparin binding. In contrast, Lys211 is not important for the binding of IGFBP-5 to heparin, but substitution for it reduced the heparin-induced affinity shift. Heparin binding to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5) leads to a 17-fold decrease in its affinity for IGF-I, and a region that contains several basic amino acids (Arg201-Arg218) may be involved in this affinity shift. In the present study, mutagenesis was used to analyze the effect of substitutions for basic amino acids in the Arg201-Arg218 region of IGFBP-5 on heparin-binding and the heparin-induced affinity shift. Nine mutant forms were prepared. Their association constants (Ka) for IGF-I were similar to native IGFBP-5. When 10 μg/ml of heparin was added, the Ka of native IGFBP-5 decreased 17-fold, and the Ka of the K134A/R136A mutant decreased 16-fold. In contrast, substitutions for specific basic amino acids in the Arg201-Arg218 region decrease the affinity shift to 1.1-3.2-fold. Lys211 was especially important. When a mutant containing that single substitution was tested, heparin caused only a 2.5-fold reduction in IGF-I affinity. Affinity cross-linking studies showed that heparin was equipotent in inhibiting the formation of 125I-IGF-I•K134A/R136A mutant complexes compared to native IGFBP-5. In contrast, heparin had minimal effects on the formation of complexes between 125I-IGF-I and the other mutants. The heparin-binding activity of each mutant was determined. Four mutants, R201A/K202N, K202A/K206A/R207A, R201A/K202N/K206N/K208N, and K211N/R214A/K217A/R218A, had reduced heparin binding compared to native IGFBP-5. The other five mutants, including the K211N mutant, showed no change in heparin binding. The four mutants with reduced heparin binding could be dissociated from heparin-Sepharose with much lower NaCl concentrations, indicating that they had reduced affinity. These findings suggest that Arg201, Lys202, Lys206, and Arg214 are important for heparin binding. In contrast, Lys211 is not important for the binding of IGFBP-5 to heparin, but substitution for it reduced the heparin-induced affinity shift."
https://openalex.org/W2111363882,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) exhibits paracrine action on numerous epithelia, including skin. We have found that cultures of normal human keratinocytes must attain confluence before KGF promotes an increase in cell number relative to untreated controls. In postconfluent cultures, treatment with KGF promoted tight packing of keratinocytes with a small basal cell morphology. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that KGF increased cell number in postconfluent cultures by affecting the ability of normal keratinocytes to undergo terminal differentiation and/or programmed cell death. In support of this hypothesis, keratinocytes treated with KGF produced fewer cross-linked envelopes and exhibited reduced membrane-associated transglutaminase activity relative to cells treated with epidermal growth factor or untreated controls. We also found that nucleosomal fragmentation was reduced in postconfluent cultures of KGF-treated keratinocytes. Furthermore, KGF-treated keratinocytes were more resistant to suspension-induced nucleosomal fragmentation than control or epidermal growth factor-treated cultures. Therefore, it appears that KGF modulates aspects of keratinocyte terminal differentiation which share features with programmed cell death. We propose that stromally-derived KGF may act as a paracrine survival factor in skin and perhaps other renewal tissues.

Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF-7), ( 1The abbreviations used are: KGFkeratinocyte growth factorKGFRkeratinocyte growth factor receptorFGFfibroblast growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorCEcross-linked envelopeBSAbovine serum albuminTGF-αtransforming growth factor αPBSphosphate-buffered salineTGasetransglutaminaseBrdUrd5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.) synthesized and secreted by stromally-derived cells, is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) superfamily (Rubin et al., 1989). The FGFs are a family of structurally related polypeptide growth factors found to modulate proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cell types (reviewed by Basilico and Moscatelli(1992) and Mason(1994)). Early experiments with KGF demonstrated that it differs from other members of the FGF family by virtue of its production in cells of mesenchymal origin and its target cell specificity for epithelial cells (Finch et al., 1989). The 2.4-kilobase KGF transcript has been detected in the dermal layer of rodent skin as well as in several fibroblast cell lines; however, transcripts were not detected in epithelial cell lines, endothelial cells, or melanocytes (Finch et al., 1989). The KGF receptor (KGFR) is a splice variant of FGF receptor-2 (FGFR2) encoded by the fgfr-2 gene (Miki et al., 1991, 1992). In skin, KGFR is localized to the spinous cells directly adjacent to the basal cell layer (LaRochelle et al., 1995). The expression pattern of KGF and KGFR, as well as the known biological activities of KGF, suggest that it functions as a paracrine mediator of epithelial cell growth in numerous tissues (reviewed by Rubin et al.(1995)). KGF-mediated mesenchymal-epithelial communication has been shown to play a role in regeneration of epidermis during wound healing (Werner et al., 1992; Tsuboi et al., 1993; Brauchle et al., 1994; Staiano-Coico et al., 1993; Pierce et al., 1994) and appears to be critical for the establishment of normal skin architecture during development (Guo et al., 1993; Werner et al., 1994; Finch et al., 1995). In developing mouse skin, KGF expression targeted to the basal layer by the keratin 14 promoter results in hyperthickening of the epidermis and a pronounced increase in cell density of inner cell layers (Guo et al., 1993). Conversely, blocking KGFR function by targeted expression of a dominant-negative KGFR to basal keratinocytes of transgenic mice results in severe atrophy of the epidermis, with basal cells becoming flattened and exhibiting pyknotic nuclei (Werner et al., 1994). keratinocyte growth factor keratinocyte growth factor receptor fibroblast growth factor epidermal growth factor cross-linked envelope bovine serum albumin transforming growth factor α phosphate-buffered saline transglutaminase 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The epidermis is a multilayered renewal tissue composed primarily of keratinocytes. Differentiated keratinocytes are continuously lost from the surface and replaced by the proliferation of basal keratinocytes. The rate at which a basal cell initiates and completes its differentiation program appears to be tightly regulated, although the molecular controls responsible for such regulation are ill-defined (reviewed by Fuchs(1993)). In vivo, the final stages of the terminal differentiation process are characterized by numerous changes including filaggrin-mediated keratin intermediate filament bundling (Dale et al., 1978), release of lipids from membrane-coating granules into the intercellular space (reviewed by Schurer et al.(1991)), and formation of the cornified envelope which consists of several proteins that are covalently cross-linked by isodipeptide bonds catalyzed by the action of calcium-dependent transglutaminases found in keratinocytes (reviewed by Aeschlimann and Paulsson(1994) and Reichert et al.(1993)). Ultimately, keratinocytes lose intracellular organelles and enucleate in the upper layers of the epidermis. Molecular mechanisms which govern keratinocyte enucleation and terminal differentiation are poorly understood. Recent studies in our laboratory ( 2K. F. Sachsenmeier and B. L. Allen-Hoffmann, submitted for publication.) and those of others (reviewed by Fesus et al.(1991), Haake and Polakowska(1993), and Polakowska et al.(1994)) suggest that terminal differentiation in keratinocytes may constitute a specialized form of apoptosis. Although several studies have suggested a link between specific mediators of apoptosis and inherited or induced dermatopathologies in humans (Bianchi et al., 1994; Nakagawa et al., 1994; reviewed by Haake and Polakowska(1993), Paus et al.(1993), and Polakowska and Hake(1994)) it has only recently been demonstrated that apoptosis is a naturally occurring process in normal human skin (Polakowska et al., 1994). In the present study, we have investigated the effects of KGF on terminal differentiation and features of apoptosis in cultured epidermal keratinocytes. We examined the effect of KGF on several aspects of terminal differentiation in vitro, including cross-linked envelope (CE) formation and membrane-associated transglutaminase activity, as well as nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a classical marker of apoptosis. Our studies suggest that KGF can forestall the ability of normal human keratinocytes to both initiate terminal differentiation and undergo features of apoptosis in vitro. Recombinant human KGF was a generous gift from Drs. Stuart Aaronson (Ruttenberg Cancer Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York City, NY) and Jeffrey Rubin (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda) or purchased from Promega Corp. Recombinant human EGF was purchased from R& Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Normal human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskin as described previously (Allen-Hoffmann and Rheinwald, 1984). Primary keratinocyte cultures (strain MH-8-Ep) were established using mitomycin-C treated Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblast feeder cells. Complete growth medium was composed of 3 parts Ham's F-12 plus 1 part Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (0.66 mM calcium final concentration) containing the following additives: 2.5% fetal calf serum, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 8.4 ng/ml cholera toxin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 24 μg/ml adenine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Standard medium contains all components of complete growth medium with the exception of EGF. Cells from primary cultures were frozen in standard growth medium and 10% glycerol to create keratinocyte stocks. EGF-free stocks of keratinocytes were generated by thawing and serially cultivating cells in standard growth medium. For experiments, cells (strain MH-8-Ep) were plated in standard growth medium without 3T3 feeder cells. Normal keratinocytes were not used beyond fifth passage. All cell cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Upon thawing, normal human keratinocytes were cultivated for one passage without EGF in the presence of a mitomycin-C-treated 3T3 feeder cell layer. For all experiments, keratinocytes were plated in standard growth medium without 3T3 feeder cells. After 24 h, the medium was changed to remove nonadherent cells and treatments were started. Treatment media consisted of standard medium supplemented with 0.5 nM EGF, 0.5 nM KGF, or 10 μl of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/ml medium (Sigma) unless noted otherwise. Medium was replaced every other day with the appropriate growth factor-containing medium. For suspension studies, preconfluent cultures from each treatment group described above were removed from culture dishes with 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% trypsin and washed in serum-containing medium to inactivate any residual trypsin. After a short centrifugation (440 × g for 3 min), cells were resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free and additive-free semi-solid medium supplemented with BSA, 0.5 nM EGF, or 0.5 nM KGF as indicated and incubated for 18-20 h at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2 incubators. Semi-solid medium was prepared as described previously (Sadek and Allen-Hoffmann, 1994) and consisted of 1.68% methylcellulose (4,000 centipoises, Fisher Scientific) in 3 parts Ham's F-12 plus 1 part Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum or additives. Cells were recovered from suspension by repeated dilution with serum-free medium and centrifugation (440 × g for 10 min). Following two rinses with phosphate-buffered saline (0.137 M NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2) (PBS), cells were either resuspended in PBS (pH 7.2) to assay for CE formation or lysed in SLS buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% (w/v) sodium lauryl sarcosine) to determine DNA fragmentation. Adherent controls consisted of keratinocytes treated for similar times in serum- and additive-free medium supplemented with the indicated growth factor, rinsed twice with PBS (pH 7.2), and scraped into the appropriate buffer. For confluence experiments, keratinocytes were removed from tissue culture plates with 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% trypsin at the desired level of confluence. Cultures typically became confluent 5 days following plating at a density of ~1.5 × 104 cells/cm2. Preconfluent cultures were harvested for assay ~4 days postplating. Postconfluent cultures were maintained in various treatment groups for the indicated times. Keratinocytes were washed in serum-containing medium, rinsed twice with PBS (pH 7.2) to remove residual culture medium, and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.2) or lysed in SLS buffer to assay CE formation and DNA fragmentation, respectively. For transglutaminase enzyme assays, treatment groups at different stages of confluence were rinsed with PBS, scraped, and enzyme activity was immediately assayed. For growth experiments, keratinocytes were plated in 6-well cluster dishes at 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in defined KBM growth medium supplemented with BSA, 0.5 nM EGF, or 0.5 nM KGF. Defined KBM growth medium (0.15 mM calcium; Clonetics, San Diego, CA) contained 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and ~30 mg of protein/ml of bovine pituitary extract. All treatments were performed in quadruplicate. Medium was replaced every other day. At various times, adherent cells were removed from culture plates with 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% trypsin, resuspended in standard medium and counted with a hemacytometer. Keratinocytes were removed from culture plates with 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% trypsin as described above and rinsed with PBS (pH 7.2). Each treatment group contained 3 replicate plates. Cells from each plate were counted and resuspended in triplicate at 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in PBS (pH 7.2) containing 10% SDS and 20 mM dithiothreitol. For suspension experiments, cells were recovered as described previously and triplicate samples assayed. Samples were boiled for 2 min in a sand heating block (Model 137925, Sybron/Thermolyne Systems, Dubuque, IA) and cooled to room temperature. DNase (1 mg/ml) was added and CEs counted using a hemacytometer. CE formation was calculated as a percentage of input cells. Membrane-associated transglutaminase was isolated as outlined (Jetten et al., 1990). Briefly, cultures were rinsed with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and scraped into 200 μl of cold PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were briefly sonicated and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Membrane-associated TGase was isolated by resuspending the pellet in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM dithiothreitol and 0.1% Emulgen 911 (generously provided by Dr. Colin Jefcoate, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). To determine the activity of TGase isolated from keratinocytes, we used a modified non-radioactive microtiter plate assay (Slaughter et al., 1992). The procedure specifically measures TGase activity using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay in high binding microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) coated with N,N′-dimethylcasein (Sigma). The amine substrate, 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (Pierce), was covalently linked to N,N′-dimethylcasein in the presence of calcium and active TGase. The biotinylated product was detected by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) followed by addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate to yield a colorimetric product whose absorbance was measured at 405 nm following a 30-min incubation at 37°C. Triplicate samples were analyzed for each treatment. The lower limit of detection for this assay is 4 activity units (OD/μg of protein/h using ~0.05 μg/ml TGase on the standard curve). Guinea pig liver transglutaminase (Sigma) was used to generate a standard activity curve for each experiment. The protein concentration of the membrane-associated TGase fraction was determined by the Pierce BCA assay (Pierce). Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Sample means were corrected for protein concentration. DNA fragments were recovered from genomic DNA samples using a modified protocol for the QIAamp Blood Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Twenty-three μl of a 20 mg/ml Proteinase K solution and 200 μl of reagent AL (QIAGEN) were added to the cell lysate prepared in SLS buffer. Following a 10-min incubation at 70°C, lysates were treated with 1 mg/ml DNase-free RNase at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequent steps were followed as specified in the manufacturer's instructions. Intact and fragmented DNA were 3′-end labeled with [α-32P]ddATP using a terminal dideoxytransferase procedure as described (Tilly and Hsueh, 1993). Each reaction mixture was comprised of 1 × reaction buffer (0.2 M potassium cacodylate, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.6), 2.5 mM cobalt chloride, terminal dideoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme (from calf thymus, 25 units; Boehringer Mannheim), 4.25 pmol of [α-32P]ddATP (specific activity 3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham), and 12.75 pmol of unlabeled ddATP. Dideoxynucleotides were utilized to ensure that only one labeled molecule was incorporated per 3′ end. Briefly, DNA (~360 ng) was added to 29 μl of reaction mixture to yield a final volume of 50 μl and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.25 M EDTA (pH 8.0). Using 50 μg of yeast tRNA (Sigma) as a carrier, labeled DNA was separated from unincorporated nucleotides by two rounds of precipitation with 3 × volume of cold 100% ethanol in the presence of 2 M ammonium acetate at −85°C. DNA was collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C and dissolved in 40 μl of TE buffer. One quarter of each sample was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel at 60 V for 4 h. Gels were dried without heat for 8 h (SE 1200 Eazy Breeze; Hoefer Scientific, San Fransisco, CA) and visualized by autoradiography. Preconfluent cultures of keratinocytes were maintained in designated treatment media for 3 days. To label DNA, all treatment groups were incubated for 6 h with 10 μM 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) followed by rinses with serum-free, additive-free medium. Following BrdUrd incorporation, cells from each treatment group were suspended in their corresponding serum- and additive-free semi-solid medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.5 nM EGF, or 0.5 nM KGF for 18 h. Adherent cultures from each treatment group were incubated for 18 h in serum- and additive-free medium supplemented with the appropriate growth factor. Adherent and suspended keratinocytes were rinsed with PBS and resuspended in concentrated incubation buffer (Boehringer Mannheim) at 3.0 × 104 cells/100 μl. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min to lyse the cells. Labeled DNA fragments were separated from labeled intact genomic DNA by centrifugation (10 min at 325 × g). Soluble DNA fragments present in the supernatant were quantified using the Cellular DNA Fragmentation ELISA (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, anti-DNA antibody was adsorbed in the wells of a microtiter plate. Supernatants containing BrdUrd-labeled DNA fragments were allowed to bind the immobilized anti-DNA antibody. After washing, the immuno-complexed BrdUrd-labeled DNA fragments were denatured and fixed to the surface of the microtiter plate by microwave irradiation. Labeled fragments were detected using an anti-BrdUrd antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The amount of peroxidase bound to the immune complex was determined by addition of a 3′,3′,5′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate. Color development progressed for 20 min and the reaction was terminated by addition of 1 M H2SO4. Absorbance of the colorimetric product was measured at 450 nm. To investigate the role of KGF in regulation of terminal differentiation of normal human keratinocytes, we cultured cells in the presence or absence of KGF. For comparison, keratinocytes were also cultured with EGF, a well studied mediator of keratinocyte growth (Rheinwald and Green, 1977; Barrandon and Green, 1987; Pittelkow et al., 1993). Consistent with findings in transgenic mice overexpressing KGF (Guo et al., 1993) and in cultured keratinocytes (3ese et al., 1990), KGF treatment increased the cell density of keratinocyte cultures. However, we observed that this occurred only after cultures attained confluence (Fig. 1). Postconfluent control keratinocyte cultures maintained in standard medium supplemented with BSA were composed predominantly of flat, granular cells some of which have achieved a suprabasal position due to stratification of the culture (Fig. 1A). Keratinocytes cultured with 0.5 or 1.6 nM EGF and allowed to become postconfluent were morphologically indishinguishable from postconfluent control cultures (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cells cultured in the presence of 0.5 nM KGF appeared remarkably different from control or EGF-treated cultures at postconfluence (Fig. 1C). Keratinocytes that became postconfluent in the presence of KGF were more tightly packed and maintained their basal cell morphology (Fig. 1C). Surprisingly, morphological differences were not readily apparent between rapidly growing control, KGF, or EGF-treated cells in preconfluent or newly confluent cultures (data not shown). Cultivation with KGF promoted tight packing of keratinocytes with a small basal cell morphology in postconfluent cultures. Based upon these observations, we asked if KGF promoted accumulation of keratinocytes at confluence by sustaining cell growth. To examine this possibility, control keratinocytes were plated at a preconfluent density in defined growth medium. Twenty-four h after plating, cells were treated with 0.5 nM KGF, 0.5 nM EGF, or BSA. Keratinocytes were counted for up to 12 days. Prior to confluence, keratinocyte cell numbers were similar, regardless of treatment, and all treatment groups achieved confluence 7 days after plating (Fig. 2). However, once confluence was attained, KGF-treated cultures accumulated over 2-fold more cells than did EGF-treated or control cultures. We have observed KGF-induced accumulation of keratinocytes following confluence in serum-containing standard medium (0.66 mM calcium) as well. EGF-treatment induced membrane ruffling in preconfluent keratinocyte cultures (data not shown), but did not promote accumulation of keratinocytes in postconfluent cultures. These findings suggest that KGF does not simply act as a mitogen but may affect the balance between proliferation and differentiation once cells have achieved confluence. We next investigated whether KGF promotes maintenance of a basal cell morphology and accumulation of keratinocytes in postconfluent cultures by altering the ability of the cells to terminally differentiate. Culture confluence induces committment to terminal differentiation which is accompanied by loss of proliferative potential and the induction of early differentiation markers such as keratins 1 and 10 (Poumay and Pittelkow, 1995). We monitored a separate marker of squamous differentiation, the formation of CE. In cultured human keratinocytes, early stages of CE assembly result in the formation of an immature cornified envelope composed of involucrin, cystatin-α, and other proteins, which represent the innermost third of the mature cornified envelope (Rice and Green, 1979; Steven and Steinert, 1994; Steinert, 1995; reviewed by Steinert and Marekov (1995)). We examined CE formation in control, KGF-treated, and EGF-treated keratinocyte cultures at different stages of confluence. In control keratinocyte cultures, the percentage of cells producing a CE increased 3-fold following confluence (Fig. 3). At confluence, keratinocytes produced comparable percentages of CE regardless of treatment group. However, in postconfluent cultures, both KGF- and EGF-treated cultures produced fewer envelopes than control cultures. In the KGF-treated culture, the reduction in CE production is sustained during the entire 5-day postconfluent period, unlike EGF-treated cultures. To confirm that KGF specifically affects CE formation, preconfluent cultures of keratinocytes cultured with or without equimolar concentrations of KGF or EGF were triggered to undergo differentiation by suspension for 18 h in medium made semi-solid with methylcellulose. Many aspects of terminal differentiation, including differential expression of keratins (Drozdoff and Pledger, 1993) and CE formation (Green, 1977), can be triggered in vitro by loss of keratinocyte cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion. We found that regardless of treatment group, <5% of all adherent preconfluent keratinocytes produce a CE (Table 1). Following 18 h of suspension, control cultures readily produced CEs. However, keratinocytes cultured with KGF and to a lesser extent, with EGF, exhibited an attenuated ability to form CE following suspension. These findings are consistent with our observations that postconfluent keratinocytes cultured in the presence of KGF produced fewer CE when compared to control or EGF-treated postconfluent cultures.Tabled 1 Because CE formation, both in vivo and in vitro, is tightly controlled by the enzymatic action of one or more of three calcium-dependent TGases found in the epidermis (reviewed by Aeschlimann and Paulsson(1994) and Reichert et al.(1993)), we determined if KGF treatment alters membrane-associated TGase activity in keratinocytes. Membrane-bound TGase 1 is localized exclusively to stratified squamous epithelia and is expressed in the suprabasal layers of skin (Thatcher and Rice, 1985; Eckert et al., 1993; Kim et al., 1995). TGase 1 is the most abundant TGase in skin (Kim et al., 1993) and its expression is associated with squamous differentiation (Greenberg et al., 1991; Thatcher and Rice, 1985). Membrane-associated TGase was isolated from control cells and cultures cultivated in the presence of KGF or EGF. All treatment groups were harvested at the indicated stages of confluence and enzyme activity measured. In control cultures, TGase activity increased approximately 10-fold as cultures attained confluence (Fig. 4). Postconfluent control cultures exhibited a 14- and 23-fold greater TGase activity at 8 and 10 days, respectively, than did preconfluent control cells. Cultivation with KGF did not alter the level of membrane-associated TGase activity in preconfluent or confluent cultures (Fig. 4). However, postconfluent KGF cultures possessed approximately half the activity found in postconfluent control cultures. Cultivation with EGF did not alter membrane-associated TGase activity in preconfluent or confluent cultures and was not as effective as KGF in maintaining low levels of TGase in postconfluent cultures, even at higher concentrations (data not shown). These data are consistent with our findings that cultivation with KGF results in attenuation of CE production and accumulation of cells with a basal phenotype. Taken together, our findings indicated that KGF may be functioning more as a survival factor than a mitogen for normal human keratinocytes. We next examined the effect of KGF on keratinocyte apoptosis by assaying internucleosomal cleavage of DNA. Specific DNA cleavage into oligonucleosomal fragments is a hallmark of apoptosis (Arends et al., 1990; Wyllie, 1980). Cells were cultured with or without equimolar concentrations of KGF or EGF and assayed for nucleosomal fragmentation patterns when preconfluent, newly confluent, or postconfluent (Fig. 5A). DNA from each treatment group was 3′ end-labeled with [32P]ddATP. Preconfluent cultures exhibited little nucleosomal fragmentation regardless of treatment (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-3). At confluence, similar amounts of nucleosomal fragmentation were observed in all treatment groups (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-6). In contrast, KGF treatment forestalled nucleosomal cleavage in postconfluent cultures of keratinocytes relative to untreated controls or EGF-treated cultures (Fig. 5A, lanes 7-9). We also assessed the ability of keratinocytes cultured in KGF or control medium to undergo nucleosomal fragmentation following suspension. Cultured keratinocytes undergo morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis when deprived of cell-cell and cell-substratum attachment by suspension in semi-solid medium.2 Preconfluent keratinocyte treated with KGF or BSA for 3 days were suspended in the appropriate serum-free, semi-solid medium containing KGF or BSA for 20 h. Adherent cells were treated for an identical time with serum-free, additive-free medium supplemented with KGF or BSA. Adherent, preconfluent cultures in both treatment groups exibited no detectable DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2). Control keratinocytes suspended in semi-solid medium exhibited DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5B, lane 3). However, keratinocytes cultivated in KGF-containing medium exhibited less suspension-induced nucleosomal fragmentation compared to controls cells (Fig. 5B, lane 4). DNA fragmentation was also assayed by a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and BrdUrd. Following BrdUrd incorporation, keratinocytes from treatment groups remained adherent or were suspended in serum-free, additive-free semi-solid medium containing 0.5 nM KGF, 0.5 nM EGF, or BSA for 18 h. Adherent cells were treated with serum-free medium containing KGF, EGF, or BSA for the identical time. Similar to the results obtained with 3′ end labeling, adherent cultures exhibited little fragmented DNA regardless of the presence or absence of growth factors (Fig. 6). However, keratinocytes cultivated in KGF-containing medium and suspended in semi-solid medium exhibited substantially less DNA fragmentation compared to suspended control cells. Cultivation in an equimolar concentration of EGF resulted in a modest attenuation of DNA fragmentation in this assay. Taken together, these findings suggest that a novel paracrine effect of KGF is to forestall keratinocyte nucleosomal fragmentation following confluence or suspension-induced differentiation. We have found that cultivation with KGF sustains proliferation of human keratinocytes after cultures have achieved confluence. Following confluence, KGF-treated cultures exhibit both a decreased capacity to form CEs and reduced membrane-associated TGase activity compared to control or EGF-treated cultures. Furthermore, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation of keratinocyte DNA, a hallmark of apoptosis, is reduced by cultivation with KGF. Our findings suggest that KGF plays an important role in modulating features of terminal differentiation that may be related to programmed cell death. Little is known about the specific biological activities of KGF in human keratinocytes. It is generally accepted that KGF, which is produced by dermal fibroblasts, acts in a paracrine manner on keratinocytes in the overlying epidermis (Finch et al., 1989). It has been previously shown that KGF is a potent mitogen for differentiation-defective murine keratinocytes, BALB/MK, inducing up to a 500-1000-fold increase in thymidine incorporation (Rubin et al., 1989). In normal murine keratinocytes, KGF has been shown to increase cell number approximately 2-fold following 7 days of treatment (Dlugosz et al., 1994). 3ese and co-workers(1990) also reported that KGF produced increases in human keratinocyte proliferation as measured by cumulative cell number. In both reports, the cell growth experiments were plated at high cell densities which likely resulted in cultures reaching confluence early during the treatment periods. We found that neither KGF nor EGF enhanced cell proliferation in low density cultures. Prior to confluence, there was no difference in cumulative cell numbers between control, EGF-treated, and KGF-treated keratinocytes. Following confluence, only KGF-treated cultures continued to accumulate cells while cell numbers in EGF-treated or control cultures appeared to plateau. Our findings with cultured human keratinocytes are consistent with a recent report on skin abnormalities exhibited by transgenic mice overexpressing KGF targeted to basal cells by the human keratin 14 promoter (Guo et al., 1993). Specifically, KGF expression resulted in an unusually high density of tightly packed keratinocytes in the epidermis. These mice had a pronounced thickening of the epidermis, primarily the result of an increase of cells in the spinous and granular layers. Taken together, these data suggest that KGF promotes accumulation of keratinocytes that have retained proliferative potential. We observed that EGF did not affect the rate of cell growth or increase the accumulation of keratinocytes into tightly packed cell monolayers after confluence. Early experiments by Rheinwald and Green(1977) and subsequent studies by Barrandon and Green(1987) also found that multiplication of small colonies of keratinocytes undergoing exponential growth was unaffected by EGF or TGF-α. They concluded that the effects of EGF and TGF-α on multiplication are dependent upon stimulation of migration. More recently, Dlugosz and co-workers (1994) demonstrated that KGF increases steady state TGF-α mRNA levels and secretion of TGF-α in primary cultures of keratinocytes isolated from newborn BALB/c mice. Given these data, it is reasonable to postulate that KGF-induced TGF-α expression may contribute to the accumulation of keratinocytes we have observed in postconfluent cultures by activating EGF receptor signaling. However, our studies show that EGF treatment does not promote tightly packed monolayers in postconfluent cultures as does KGF treatment. Furthermore, mice overexpressing TGF-α driven by the keratin 14 promoter also do not exhibit the increase in cell density or cell packing observed in KGF transgenic mice (Vassar and Fuchs, 1991; Guo et al., 1993). Given the divergent patterns of cell density and cell packing exhibited by KGF and TGF-α transgenic mice and our similar findings with KGF and EGF-treated human keratinocyte cultures, it is unlikely that KGF action is mediated solely through increased production of keratinocyte TGF-α. The present study shows that KGF treatment reduces nucleosomal fragmentation in postconfluent cultures of keratinocytes. Furthermore, we found that KGF-treated preconfluent cultures exhibit decreased nucleosomal fragmentation following loss of cell-cell and cell-substratum adhesion. It has been well documented that keratinocytes from all species studied to date can undergo apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro (Marthinuss et al., 1995a, 1995b; McCall and Cohen, 1991; Bianchi et al., 1994; Frisch and Francis, 1994; Sayama et al., 1994; Schwarz et al., 1995). Epidermal keratinocytes are destined to enucleate and lose metabolic activity as part of their differentiation pathway. As basal keratinocytes of intact skin proliferate, cells which leave the basal compartment progress upwards through a program of terminal differentiation. Fully differentiatied cells are eventually shed from the skin surface. A balance between basal cell proliferation and cell loss is required for the maintenance of normal epidermal architecture. Budtz and Spies(1989) studied the natural deletion of skin cells in the African toad, Bufo bufo, and demonstrated that apoptosis was one of the mechanisms by which surplus cells were lost. Using TUNEL analysis, Polakowska and co-workers(1994) demonstrated that intact tissue from developing fetal and adult human skin contains cells with DNA breaks in their nuclei. Keratinocytes that exhibited nuclear changes associated with apoptosis were located primarily in the upper granular layer and only occasionally in the spinous layer of epidermis. Because KGF-treated postconfluent cultures exhibited reduced nucleosomal fragmentation, it is reasonable to postulate that KGF promotes accumulation of cells by inhibiting basal cell loss through cell death pathways, such as apoptosis. Many parallels exist between keratinocyte terminal differentiation and apoptosis. For example, mature cornified envelopes and apoptotic bodies are transglutaminase cross-linked end-products of terminal differentiation and programmed cell death pathways, respectively. The amino acid composition of cornified envelopes from human skin and apoptotic bodies from liver are very similar and show almost identical peptide mapping patterns (Tarcsa et al., 1992). It has been suggested that terminal differentiation of keratinocytes may actually be a specialized form of apoptosis (Polakowska and Hake, 1994; Polakowska et al., 1994; Fesus et al., 1991; Paus et al., 1993; Alison and Sarraf, 1992). We found that KGF reduced CE and membrane-associated TGase activity in postconfluent but not subconfluent cultures. These finding may, in part, explain the basal-like, tightly packed morphology of KGF-treated postconfluent cultures in contrast to the large, flattened cells observed in control and EGF-treated cultures. Equimolar concentrations of EGF were not as effective as KGF in reducing CE formation and membrane-associated TGase activity in postconfluent keratinocyte cultures. 3ese and co-workers(1990) reported that EGF, but not KGF, forestalls expression of the differentiation-specific keratin K1 as well as filaggrin in response to calcium-induced differentiation. This report, in conjunction with the phenotypes exhibited by TGF-α and KGF transgenic mice suggest that these two growth regulatory factors most likely have differing biological activities in keratinocytes. Werner and co-workers (1994) recently reported that mice expressing a dominant-negative KGF receptor transgene targeted to basal epidermal keratinocytes exhibited severe atrophy of the epidermis. Specifically, the transgenic basal keratinocytes contained pyknotic nuclei and premature onset of cornification. It was concluded that addition of the dominant-negative KGF receptor disturbed the balance between proliferation and differentiation. Our findings of reduced nucleosomal fragmentation, CE formation, and membrane-associated TGase activity in postconfluent or suspended keratinocyte cultures suggest that KGF, and to a lesser extent EGF, promotes survival of keratinocytes signalled to differentiate. We propose that KGF may be functioning, in part, as a survival factor, thus affecting those aspects of keratinocyte differentiation which share features with cell death, such as enucleation and formation of CE (cornification). We extend our sincere thanks to Dr. Stuart Aaronson and Dr. Jeffrey Rubin for providing recombinant human KGF in the early stages of these studies; Dr. Thomas Slaughter for technical comments and suggestions on the transglutaminase assay; and Dr. Christine Sadek, Kris Sachsenmeier, Margaret Weitzel, and Sandy Schlosser for critically reviewing the manuscript."

We also evaluated the possible alterations, induced by E1A oncogene transformation on the intracellular pathways mediating somatostatin inhibition of cell proliferation. We showed that somatostatin was able to powerfully inhibit insulin- and insulin + TSH-dependent cell proliferation by inducing a block in the G1/S progression in the cell cycle. These cytostatic effects were completely reverted by vanadate, suggesting that somatostatin may induce antiproliferative effects through the modulation of phosphotyrosine phosphatases. In the E1A-transformed cell line, somatostatin was completely ineffective. The lack of somatostatin inhibitory effects on cell proliferation were not due to alterations in the expression of somatostatin receptors, which were regularly expressed and coupled to adenylyl cyclase activity, but were dependent on an alteration in their coupling with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase. In fact, although in PC Cl3 cells somatostatin increased by 100% phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity, it was completely ineffective in E1A-expressing cells. In conclusion we demonstrated that somatostatin activates phosphotyrosine phosphatases in PC Cl3 thyroid cells to inhibit cell proliferation and that the stable expression of E1A oncogene in these cells completely abolishes this antiproliferative effect.

The signal transduction pathways utilized by Fas are currently unknown, although tyrosine kinase activity has recently been strongly implicated. Here, we report that the tyrosine kinase p59fyn physically associates with Fas in Fas-sensitive cells. In addition, we show that activated T lymphocytes from fyn knockout mice exhibit elevated lifespans and reduced apoptosis in vitro compared to their normal counterparts. Furthermore, activated T lymphocytes from the fyn- deficient mice are less sensitive to killing by both anti-Fas antibody and Fas-ligand cytotoxic T cells.

INTRODUCTIONThe recruitment of leukocytes from the blood compartment to the site of inflammation represents one of the characteristic elements of the inflammatory process(1.Mantovani A. Bussolino F. Dejana E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Locally produced chemotactic agonists are believed to play a crucial role in the “multistep paradigm” of leukocyte accumulation in tissues(2.Butcher E.C.

Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6372) Google Scholar).In the past few years a new superfamily of chemotactic cytokines, named chemokines, was described. The hallmark of this family is a four conserved cysteine motif(4.Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 99-179Google Scholar, 5.Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Crit. Rev.

According to the relative position of the first two cysteines it is possible to distinguish two families: the C-X-C (or α) chemokines, active on neutrophils and T lymphocytes (4.Baggiolini M.

This protein is characterized by the absence of the first and third cysteines and is active on T lymphocytes (10.Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A.

Activated chemotactic receptors induce remodeling of membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipases (C, D, and A2) and these events ultimately lead to the induction of different biological responses: chemotaxis, activation of the oxidative burst, and release of lysosomal enzymes(12.Murphy P.M.

Because of the lack of specific inhibitors, the relative contribution of these enzymes in arachidonic acid metabolism in human monocytes is still uncertain.In this paper we report that MCP-1-stimulated monocytes selectively released [3H]arachidonic acid; no detectable release of [14C]oleic acid was observed. This effect paralleled the phosphorylation of cPLA2 evaluated by Western blot analysis. In addition, by the use of a specific antisense oligonucleotide, we show that cPLA2 plays a crucial role in the chemotactic response of human monocytes to C-C chemokines.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemoattractantsHuman recombinant MCP-1 and RANTES were from PeproTech Inc.

Cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.3 mM EDTA (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), layered on top of Ficoll (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), and centrifuged at 800 × g at room temperature for 25 min. Mononuclear cells were recovered, diluted, and washed twice in PBS at 4°C. To remove platelets specifically adherent to monocytes, mononuclear cells were resuspended in fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone, Logan, UT) containing 5 mM EDTA and subjected to two sequential incubations (15 min) at 37°C. Platelet-free mononuclear cells were recovered by centrifugation at 400 × g at room temperature for 15 min. Monocytes were further purified (>90% pure) by centrifugation at 600 × g on a 46% isoosmotic Percoll (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) gradient, as described previously(30.Sozzani S. Luini W. Molino M.

The monocyte preparation obtained did not release [3H]arachidonic acid when challenged with 10 units/ml thrombin (Sigma).Oligonucleotide TreatmentA 16-base-long antisense oligonucleotide (Duotech, Milan, Italy) was designed originating just downstream from the initiation site of the cPLA2 cDNA (26.Clark J.D.

As control, the same oligonucleotide with four mismatched bases (5′-GTGCTCCTAAGTTTCTAT-3′) or an unrelated c-myb antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GCAGCGCGTCCGCCGAGA-3′) (31.Arsura M. Introna M. Passerini F. Mantovani A. Golay J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2708-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used. Human monocytes (0.7 × 106/ml) were cultured in Petriperm dishes (Haereus, Vienna, Austria) in the presence of different concentrations of oligonucleotides in RPMI 1640 (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) for 4 h. A final concentration of 5% FCS was then added, and monocytes were kept in culture for additional 24-40 h(31.Arsura M. Introna M. Passerini F. Mantovani A. Golay J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2708-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide treatment and culture conditions were not toxic for monocytes as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion (cell viability, >95%).Immunoblot Analysis of cPLA2Control and activated monocytes (2 × 107/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) or oligonucleotide-treated cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μM leupeptin, 2000 units/ml aprotinin, 50 μM pepstatin A, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, 200 μM NaF). After the addition of sample buffer (0.625 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.5 M 1,4-dithiothreitol, 20% SDS), samples were boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20 mA/gel) using a 60:1 ratio of acrylamide:bisacrylamide. Electrophoresis was stopped 4 h after the tracking dye had left the gel as described previously(32.Sa G. Murugesan G. Jaye M. Ivashchenko Y. Fox P.L. J. Biol.

Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose paper (BA 83, Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting (120 mA overnight at room temperature). The quality of the transfer was evaluated by staining the nitrocellulose paper with Ponceau S (0.5% in 5% trichloroacetic acid). Nitrocellulose paper was incubated for 1 h in TNE (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-human cPLA2 (1:2000 dilution) kindly donated by Dr. L. Marshall (SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA) and Dr. J. D. Clark (Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, MA). The two antisera were used with identical results. Immunoreactivity was detected by ECL (Amersham Corp.) and quantitated by densitometric analysis (IBAS 2 Kontron, Milan, Italy). In some experiments, monocytes were resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μM leupeptin, 2000 units/ml aprotinin, 50 μM pepstatin A, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, 200 μM NaF) and disrupted by sonication. Sonicated cells were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4°C for 1 h. Supernatants and pellets obtained with this procedure were used as cytosol and membrane fractions, respectively(33.Sozzani S. Agwu D.E. McCall C.E. O'Flaherty J.T. Schmitt J.D. Kent J.D. McPhail L.C.

Incubation did not affect cell viability (>95%, by trypan blue dye exclusion) nor the ability of monocytes to migrate in response to MCP-1. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed twice and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.2% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Monocytes (107/ml) were prewarmed at 37°C for 5 min and then stimulated. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform/methanol/formic acid (1:2:0.2, v/v/v) followed by agitation. Cell extracts were transferred to centrifuge tubes, and 1 ml of water and 2 ml of chloroform were added. Chromatographic separation of lipids was performed by evaporating the organic phase under a stream of nitrogen, redissolving the residue in chloroform, and loading the extract on silica gel G plates (Merck). Fatty acids were separated by thin layer chromatography using hexane/ethyl ether/formic acid (15:10:1, v/v/v) as a solvent system for 30 min as reported previously (18.Locati M. Zhou D. Luini W. Evangelista V. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4746-4753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free fatty acids position on TLC plates was determined as comigration with commercially available standards after exposure to iodine vapors. Quantitative determination was obtained by scraping portions of the silica gel into scintillation vials followed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The results are expressed as the percentage of radioactivity in the fatty acid band on the total radioactivity recovered from each lane. For phospholipid analysis, TLC plates (silica gel H) were resolved with solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:25:8:2, v/v/v) for 15 cm. Phospholipids were identified based on comigration with commercially available standards, and quantitative evaluation was performed by liquid scintillation spectrometry(18.Locati M. Zhou D. Luini W.

The two compartments were separated by a 5-μm pore size PVP membrane (Nucleopore). Chambers were incubated at 37°C in air with 5% CO2 for 90 min. At the end of the incubation, filters were removed, fixed, and stained with Diff-Quik (Baxter s.p.a., Rome, Italy). Migrated monocytes in five high power oil immersion fields were counted.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for MCP-1MCP-1 levels in monocyte culture supernatants were evaluated by a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay exactly as described previously(35.Peri G. Milanese C. Matteucci C. Ruco L. Zhou D. Sozzani S. Coletta I. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The lower limit of sensitivity for this assay is 40 pg/ml.RESULTSEffect of MCP-1 on the Release of [3H]Arachidonic Acid and [14C]Oleic Acid from Labeled Human MonocytesInitial studies were designed to examine the selectivity of MCP-1-induced PLA2 activity(s) for arachidonic acid. Monocytes cultured in nonadherent conditions in the presence of both [3H]arachidonic acid and [14C]oleic acid for 18 h showed a comparable uptake of the two labels (47.4 ± 2.5 and 46.9 ± 1.9%, respectively; n = 4) with more than 90% of the labels incorporated in the phospholipid pools (data not shown). Distribution of the labels in phospholipids was: 60 ± 3.6 and 72 ± 2.6% phosphatidylcholine, 11 ± 2.0 and 9 ± 1.8% phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidyletanolamine, and 31 ± 4.7 and 12 ± 2.9% phosphatidylserine for [3H]arachidonic acid and [14C]oleic acid, respectively (n = 3). Maximal chemotactic activity of MCP-1 is observed at 50-100 ng/ml (6-12 nM; 30) and these concentrations were used throughout this study. As shown in Fig. 1, 100 ng/ml MCP-1 induced a rapid accumulation of [3H]arachidonic acid that peaked between 3 and 10 min and, at 3 min, corresponded to 196 ± 18% (n = 4) of control group activity (Fig. 1). MCP-1 activation appeared to be specific for arachidonic acid because no detectable release of [14C]oleic acid was observed up to 30 min of stimulation. In the same experimental conditions, 10-7 M fMLP for 3 min resulted in the release of 577 ± 128% and 163 ± 11% of control cells for [3H]arachidonic acid and [14C]oleic acid, respectively (n = 4).Effect of MCP-1 on cPLA2 PhosphorylationAgonist-triggered cPLA2 activation, including that mediated by seven transmembrane domain receptors, is associated with increased phosphorylation of the protein on serine residues resulting in a stable 3-4-fold increase of cPLA2 catalytic activity(36.Nemenoff R.A.

In agreement with previous reports (40.Nakamura T. Lin L.L. Kharbanda S. Knopf J. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4917-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 41.Xu X.X. Rock C.O. Qiu Z.H. Leslie C.C. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31693-31700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Western blot analysis of resting human monocytes shows that in these cells cPLA2 migrates as a doublet (Fig. 2). Three min of stimulation with 100 ng/ml MCP-1 caused a decrease of the intensity of the faster migrating band and an increase in the intensity of the slower migrating species. Similar results were obtained with fMLP (Fig. 2) and with MCP-3 (data not shown). A short (1 min) preincubation of monocytes with 100 nM platelet-activating factor, before MCP-1 stimulation, resulted in the complete loss of the faster migrating band (Fig. 2). These results parallel the synergism observed between platelet-activating factor and MCP-1 in terms of [3H]arachidonic acid release from prelabeled cells(18.Locati M. Zhou D. Luini W. Evangelista V.

The relative changes in the two immunoreactive bands could be quantified by densitometry and expressed as the ratio of the slower over the faster migrating band: 1.5 ± 0.2 and 4.1 ± 0.6 for control and MCP-1-stimulated cells, respectively (n = 3; p < 0.05 by paired Student's t test). Fig. 3 shows that a shift in the ratio of cPLA2 immunoreactive bands was present in both cytosolic and membrane fractions. The effect was time-dependent, detectable 1 min after stimulation, reaching statistical significance in both cytosol and membrane between 3 and 5 min and declining to basal levels thereafter (data not shown).Figure 2:Effect of MCP-1 stimulation on the electrophoretic mobility of cPLA2 in human monocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1792398103,"To delineate the regions of liver glucokinase that are involved in the binding of its regulatory protein and have therefore been conserved throughout evolution, we have cloned the cDNA of the Xenopus laevis enzyme. It contains an open reading frame of 1374 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 458 amino acids, which displays 78 and 79% overall identity to rat and human liver glucokinases, respectively. The conserved regions are predicted to be present mainly in the small domain and the hinge region of glucokinase, and the nonconserved regions in the large domain of the enzyme.We constructed five mutants of Xenopus glucokinase by replacing sets of 2-5 glucokinase-specific residues with their counterparts in the C-terminal half of rat hexokinase I. The affinity for the regulatory protein was not markedly changed for mutants B, D, and E despite a decreased affinity for glucose in mutants B and D. Two other mutants (A and C) were 9- and 250-fold less sensitive to the rat regulator and 40- and 770-fold less sensitive to the Xenopus regulator, respectively, but presented a normal affinity for glucose. The double mutant (A-C) was completely insensitive to inhibition by the regulatory protein. A control mutant (F), obtained by replacing 3 residues that were not conserved in all glucokinases, had a normal affinity for glucose and for the regulatory protein. The property of glucokinase to be inhibited by palmitoyl-CoA was not affected by the mutations described. It is concluded that His-141 to Leu-144, which are located close to the tip of the small domain, as well as Glu-51 and Glu-52, which are present in the large domain of the enzyme close to the hinge region, or nearby residues participate in the binding of the regulatory protein.

The hexokinase family consists of several evolutionarily related enzymes, all of which catalyze the phosphorylation of glucose. In this family, animal glucokinases (also called hexokinase D or IV) are characterized by a number of kinetic properties that are not shared with the other hexokinases: 1) a low affinity for glucose, 2) a sigmoidal saturation curve for this substrate, and 3) the property to be inhibited by a regulatory protein as well as by 4) long chain acyl-CoAs(1.Randle P.J. Diabetologia. 1993; 36: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2.Iynedjian P.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 3.Van Schaftingen E. Detheux M. Veiga-da-Cunha M. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Kinetic evidence indicates that these two types of inhibitors bind to a site distinct from the catalytic site despite the fact that their action is competitively counteracted by glucose. The four properties mentioned above appear to be shared by all animal glucokinases(4.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that the amino acid residues participating in these regulatory functions have been conserved. Therefore, it is of interest to identify the amino acid sequences that have been specifically conserved in the glucokinase subfamily. The sequence of glucokinase is only known for a few enzymes that are relatively close from an evolutionary point of view. These are rat liver glucokinase (5.Andreone T.L. Printz R.L. Pilkis S.J.

Liver and islet glucokinases are encoded by the same gene, which has two promoters and from which two types of mRNA are derived. These mRNAs differ by the first exon and give rise to two proteins that differ by 15 amino acids in their amino-terminal region(2.Iynedjian P.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Glucokinases show 32-34% identity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae hexokinases A and B (9.Fothergill-Gilmore L. Michels P.A.M. Prog.

To determine the regions specifically conserved in the glucokinase family, we decided to clone a glucokinase that was relatively distant from mammalian glucokinase. The glucokinase from Xenopus liver seemed appropriate since the separation of amphibians from mammals probably occurred some 350 million years ago(12.Doolittle R.F. Anderson K.L. Feng D.F.

Sequencing was done on both strands after alkaline denaturation by the dideoxy method (20.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) using T3 and T7 primers on progressive deletion subclones generated by exonuclease III (21.Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2828) Google Scholar) or using insert-specific primers. The recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli in the expression system of Studier and Moffatt(22.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). PCR ( 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s).) mutagenesis was used to introduce in pBS-XGK2.1 an NdeI restriction site at the initial ATG codon and a BamHI restriction site after the termination codon; the primers used were 5′-GTGCATATGGAAACATTTGA-3′ and 5′-ACGGATCCACTAGTGACCAAT-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). After purification by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, the PCR-amplified fragment was cloned in the EcoRV site of the pBlueScript KS+ vector to generate pBS-XGK1374. The amplified DNA was sequenced to rule out any PCR errors. The coding region was then excised from pBS-XGK1374 with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the expression vector pET3a to generate pET-XGK. This plasmid was used to transform the E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS strain. These cells were grown in M9 medium containing 1% glucose, 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, and 0.03 mg/ml chloramphenicol until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. The inducer isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.4 mM, and the cultures were incubated in an orbital shaker for 23 h at 22°C. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously(13.Veiga-da-Cunha M. Detheux M. Watelet N. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23.Lange A.J. Li L. Vargas A.M. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8078-8084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Slightly more than half of the recombinant glucokinase was soluble when the expression was performed under these conditions, whereas all of the recombinant glucokinase was present as an insoluble form when the culture and the induction were carried out at 37°C. polymerase chain reaction kilobase pair(s). For the purification of the recombinant glucokinase, a cell pellet derived from a 1-liter culture was resuspended in 50 ml of lysing buffer(13.Veiga-da-Cunha M. Detheux M. Watelet N. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the fraction of protein precipitating between 30 and 60% (NH4)2SO4 was prepared. The pellet was resuspended in 3.5 ml of buffer A (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.1, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, and 1 μg/ml antipain) and gel-filtered on a Sephadex G-25 fine column equilibrated with buffer A. The fractions containing glucokinase activity (6 ml) were then chromatographed on a 1.6 × 13-cm DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and the retained glucokinase was eluted with a linear KCl gradient (20-500 mM in 2 × 100 ml of buffer A). The fractions with the highest specific activities were pooled (17 ml), and this preparation was used for kinetic investigation. The mutants of Xenopus liver glucokinase (XGK-A, XGK-B, XGK-C, XGK-D, XGK-E, and XGK-F) were constructed by an adaptation of the PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis procedure described in (24.Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). For each mutant, the plasmid pBS-XGK1374 was amplified using Pwo DNA polymerase and two “back-to-back” primers phosphorylated at their 5′-ends. One or both primers contained the mismatches needed to generate the site-directed mutations (see Table 1 for primer sequences). The PCR-amplified plasmids were purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, ligated, and amplified in E. coli XL1Blue. PCR errors were ruled out, and the mutations introduced were checked by sequencing the amplified DNA either 1) between the start codon (NdeI restriction site) and a unique internal NcoI restriction site (581 base pairs) for mutants XGK-A, XGK-B, XGK-C, and XGK-D or 2) between the NcoI site and the BamHI site that flanks the stop codon for mutants XGK-E and XGK-F. These nucleotide sequences were then excised from the amplified DNA and introduced in pET-XGK to replace the non-mutated sequences and to generate pET-XGK-A, pET-XGK-B, pET-XGK-C, pET-XGK-D, pET-XGK-E, and pET-XGK-F. The double mutant, pET-XGK-A-C, was constructed by inserting an NsiI-NcoI fragment of pET-XGK-A in the appropriate position in pET-XGK-C. The expression and the purification of the recombinant proteins were performed as described above.Tabled 1 Glucokinase was assayed by a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay(14.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The regulatory protein was assayed by its ability to inhibit glucokinase. One unit of both rat and Xenopus regulatory protein is defined as the amount causing 50% inhibition of 15 milliunits of rat glucokinase in 1 ml in the presence of 5 mM glucose and, in the case of the rat regulator, of also 200 μM fructose 6-phosphate (25.Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Protein was measured according to Bradford (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. From the screening of the Xenopus liver cDNA library, three positive clones were isolated, two of which were identical. The latter, termed pBS-XGK2 and pBS-XGK7, contained an insert of ~5.0 kb total length, with four EcoRI fragments of 0.24, 0.95, 0.75, and 3.0 kb. The insert of the third clone (pBS-XGK1) had a total length of 2.9 kb and contained two EcoRI fragments of 0.15 and 2.7 kb. Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-restricted plasmids revealed that the 3.0-kb fragment of pBS-XGK2 and pBS-XGK7 as well as the 2.7-kb fragment of pBS-XGK1 were homologous to the rat glucokinase cDNA. These fragments were subcloned, and the longest, termed pBS-XGK2.1, was completely sequenced on both strands. Fig. 1 shows that it has a total length of 3005 base pairs and contains an open reading frame of 1374 base pairs, encoding a protein of 458 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 51,154 Da (including the initiator methionine). The initiator codon (nucleotide 350) is preceded by an in-frame stop codon at nucleotide 278, indicating that the coding region of the isolated clone is complete at its 5′-end. This cDNA also contains a polyadenylation signal (nucleotides 2970-2975) followed by a short polyadenylation tail. The 2.7-kb fragment of pBS-XGK1 was partially sequenced and found to correspond to nucleotides 355-2987 of the sequence shown in Fig. 1, with a poly(A) tail of 20 nucleotides. The other inserts present in clones pBS-XGK1 and pBS-XGK2 (or pBS-XGK7) presumably correspond to unrelated cDNAs that were ligated during the construction of the cDNA library. This is indicated by the fact that the glucokinase cDNAs were flanked on both sides by sequences that are typical of EcoRI linkers. Furthermore, the 0.15-kb EcoRI fragment of pBS-XGK1 contained a poly(A) tail (data not shown). The isolated cDNA was expressed in E. coli to verify if it encoded a protein with the properties of glucokinase. The recombinant glucokinase was purified by a procedure involving ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion-exchange chromatography. It was eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose column at a KCl concentration of 0.32 M and was nearly homogeneous at this stage. From 1 liter of culture, the yield was 800 units of glucokinase, with a specific activity of 10 units/mg of protein (25 units/mg of protein if the protein assay was carried out with bovine serum albumin as a standard); this value is comparable to those observed for other recombinant glucokinases(23.Lange A.J. Li L. Vargas A.M. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8078-8084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Liang Y. Kesavan P. Wang L. Niswender K. Tanizawa Y. Permutt M.A. Magnuson M.A. Matschinsky F.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recombinant Xenopus glucokinase displayed a sigmoidal saturation curve for glucose, with an S0.5 of 2.3 mM, and was inhibited competitively by palmitoyl-CoA as well as by rat and Xenopus liver regulatory proteins (see Table 1 and Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with non-recombinant Xenopus liver glucokinase (data not shown), confirming that the cloned cDNA encoded the latter enzyme. In Fig. 2, the sequence of Xenopus liver glucokinase has been aligned with those of rat liver and human beta cell glucokinases and with those of hexokinases that are insensitive to the regulatory protein (4.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ( 2A. Vandercammen and E. Van Schaftingen, unpublished results.) These sequences are of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of rat hexokinases I and II (28.Schwab D.A. Wilson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3220-3224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Schwab D.A. Wilson J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. 1991; 286: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and of S. cerevisiae hexokinases A and B(31.Stachelek C. Stachelek J. Swan J. Botstein D. Konigsberg W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 945-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 also shows the secondary structure assigned to yeast hexokinase B and to human glucokinase and the amino acid residues implicated in the binding of glucose(10.Charles St., R. Harrison R.W. Bell G.I. Pilkis S.J. Weber I.T. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11.Anderson C.M. McDonald R.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The overall identity of Xenopus glucokinase to the rat and human glucokinases is 78 and 79%, respectively. As previously observed for other glucokinases(7.Tanizawa Y. Koranyi L.I. Welling C.M. Permutt M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7294-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the amino-terminal end of glucokinase, corresponding to the residues encoded by the first exon, is not conserved; it is 6 and 7 amino acids shorter in the Xenopus enzyme than in its rat and human counterparts, respectively. When the sequence encoded by the remaining exons is considered, the identity to the rat and human enzymes amounts to 80 and 81%, which is much less than the 98% value observed when comparing rat to human glucokinase. As expected, the residues involved directly in glucose binding (10.Charles St., R. Harrison R.W. Bell G.I. Pilkis S.J. Weber I.T. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) are the same in Xenopus glucokinase as in other hexokinases. To locate the conserved and nonconserved residues in the three-dimensional structure of glucokinase, a space-filling model (Fig. 3) was used because it emphasizes the surface residues, which are most likely involved in protein-protein interaction. Three different color codes identify the amino acids according to their degree of conservation. Residues that are different among glucokinases are green; these residues are most likely unimportant for glucokinase function. Those that are present in all glucokinases but not in the C-terminal half of hexokinase I or II are orange; these residues are likely to be involved in the glucokinase-specific functions, including the binding of the regulatory protein. The remaining residues are yellow; they correspond to residues that are conserved among glucokinases and in the C-terminal halves of hexokinases I and II. They are presumed to be important for hexokinase function in general, but they could also play an auxiliary role in the glucokinase-specific functions. The model shows the two domains of glucokinase connected by the hinge region, which comprises the catalytic cleft (Fig. 3, a and b). It appears that the green (nonconserved) residues are spread over most of the surface of glucokinase. There is, however, a large region that is almost free of green residues: it extends on the front face of glucokinase from the tip of the small domain to the hinge region and the neighboring part of the large domain. Since this large region is made up of a number of glucokinase-specific (orange) residues, we hypothesized that it contained the binding site for the regulatory protein. To test the latter hypothesis, we have constructed several mutants (XGK-A, XGK-B, XGK-C, XGK-D, and XGK-F) of Xenopus glucokinase (see Fig. 2) in which we have replaced glucokinase-specific residues with the equivalent ones in the C-terminal half of rat hexokinase I (see Table 1). To increase the probability of having a significant effect, we chose mutations that resulted in a change in the electric charge. In addition, we have made a control mutant (XGK-E) in a region that is not conserved among glucokinases. The mutated glucokinase proteins were all expressed and purified as described above, except for mutant XGK-F, which proved to be insoluble and could therefore not be further investigated. The kinetic properties of the five soluble mutants were compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. Table 1 shows that the S0.5 was not significantly affected for mutants XGK-A, XGK-C, and XGK-E, but that it was increased ~2- and 10-fold for mutants XGK-B and XGK-D, respectively. This last mutant also showed a decrease in the sigmoidicity of the saturation curve for glucose. The decrease in affinity for glucose of mutant XGK-D is not surprising since the five consecutive mutations (Val-154 to Asp-158) introduced are close to the glucose-binding residue Ser-151 (Figure 2:, Figure 3:)(32.Xu L.Z. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Pilkis S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9939-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Like the wild-type enzyme, all mutants were 50% inhibited at a concentration of ~2 μM palmitoyl-CoA (Table 1). We then investigated the sensitivity of the various mutants to inhibition by the regulatory proteins both from rat liver and from Xenopus liver (Fig. 4). Mutants XGK-B, XGK-D, and XGK-E had the same sensitivity as the wild-type enzyme for rat regulatory protein and a slightly (1.5-2-fold) decreased sensitivity to Xenopus regulatory protein. In contrast, mutants XGK-A and XGK-C showed a reduction of 9- and 250-fold in their affinity for rat regulatory protein (Fig. 4b) and of 40- and 770-fold for Xenopus regulatory protein (Fig. 4a), respectively. Because of the important effect of these mutations, we also constructed the double mutant (XGK-A-C). This mutant proved to be insensitive to the highest concentration of regulatory proteins used (~1 μM). Remarkably, it had conserved the same affinity for glucose and for palmitoyl-CoA as the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). Furthermore, all mutants and the wild-type protein had a similar heat stability, except for mutant XGK-E, which was half-maximally inactivated at 32°C as compared with 35°C (5-min incubation) for the other proteins. This result, as well as the fact that the affinities for glucose and palmitoyl-CoA and the Vmax were unchanged, indicates that the lower affinity of mutants XGK-A, XGK-C, and XGK-A-C for the regulatory protein is not due to gross structural changes(33.Plapp B.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 3(c and d) shows the locations of the mutations in the glucokinase model as well as of Asn-166, a residue that, when mutated to arginine, results in a severalfold decrease in the affinity of human beta cell glucokinase for rat liver regulatory protein. ( 3M. Veiga-da-Cunha, L. Z. Xu, Y. H. Lee, D. Marotta, S. J. Pilkis, and E. Van Schaftingen, unpublished results.) The residues mutated in XGK-D, which has a lower affinity for glucose (S0.5 = 19 mM), are in the vicinity of the catalytic cleft, whereas those mutated in XGK-F, an insoluble protein, are internal residues present inside the large domain. The residues mutated in XGK-A and XGK-C, which have a lower affinity for the regulatory protein, are situated at two extremities of the broad glucokinase-specific conserved region, whereas Asn-166 is closer to the center of this same region. The fact that region D, which lies between regions A and C, does not appear to participate in the binding of the regulatory protein suggests that the binding site for the regulatory protein is bipartite or that it has a complex shape. A remarkable feature of the residues mutated in XGK-C, the mutant most affected in its affinity for the regulatory protein, is that they form a basic loop with two protruding side chains (His-141 and Lys-142). We have tested the possibility that a peptide of glucokinase containing residues 139-146 was able to compete with the enzyme for the inhibition by the regulatory protein. However, there was no release of inhibition at peptide concentrations up to 10−4M. This lack of effect could be due to the fact that the peptide does not adopt the appropriate conformation to bind to the regulatory protein (see also below). Whether residues 51, 52, and 141-144 are directly implicated in the binding of the regulatory protein cannot be decided at present. An alternative explanation for the decreased affinity for the regulatory protein induced by the mutations could be that they result in localized changes in the three-dimensional arrangement of adjacent residues that would be directly involved in the binding of the regulatory protein. Such structural changes, if present, diminish with distance(33.Plapp B.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which allows us to conclude that the regulatory protein binds, if not to residues 51-52 and 141-144, to nearby residues. The fact that the regulatory protein binds to the small domain of glucokinase and to its hinge region is in agreement with the idea that it interacts with a site distinct from the catalytic site(4.Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We speculate that this binding results in competitive inhibition because it prevents the conformational changes that occur during catalysis. It is indeed well known that glucose binding induces closure of the catalytic cleft in the case of yeast hexokinase(34.Bennett Jr., W.S. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4848-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The fact that the mutations affecting the inhibition by the regulatory protein do not affect the sensitivity to palmitoyl-CoA indicates that the binding sites for these two inhibitors either are different or do not entirely coincide.

https://openalex.org/W2017737951,"Abstract The protonophoretic function of uncoupling protein (UCP) is activated by fatty acids. According to the “docking site” hypothesis (Jezek, P., and Garlid, K. D., J. Biol. Chem. 265, 19303-19311, 1990), the fatty acid binding site is identical with the anion channel of UCP. Skulachev (Skulachev, V. P. (1991) FEBS Lett. 294, 158-162) extended this hypothesis by suggesting that fatty acid anions are transported by UCP and that H are delivered by back-diffusion of the protonated fatty acid through the lipid bilayer. In this model, UCP does not transport H at all but rather enables fatty acids to act as cycling protonophores. New evidence supports this mechanism (Garlid, K. D., Orosz, D. E., Modrianský, M., Vassanelli, S., and Jezek, P. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 2615-2620). To help elucidate these hypotheses, we synthesized a photoreactive analog of dodecanoic acid, 12-(4-azido-2-nitrophenylamino)dodecanoic acid (AzDA), and studied its effect on transport in mitochondria and proteoliposomes. AzDA behaved in every respect like a typical fatty acid. In micromolar doses, AzDA activated H translocation and inhibited Cl and hexanesulfonate uniport through UCP. After UV light exposure, however, activation of H transport was inhibited, whereas inhibition of anion transport was preserved. These effects were irreversible. Photolabeling of mitochondria with [3H]AzDA resulted in a prominent 32 kDa band of UCP, and few other proteins were labeled. The results indicate that AzDA can be ligated to the protein at or near the docking site, causing irreversible inhibition of both H and anion transport. The finding that fatty acid-induced H transport disappears along with anion transport supports the fatty acid-protonophore mechanism of H transport by UCP."

Because paxillin is a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that may play a role in regulating cell morphology, we examined its expression in neuronal cells and how its tyrosine phosphorylation is related to neurite outgrowth. Paxillin was identified in several neuronal cell lines with an increased level upon differentiation. In SH-SY5Y cells, paxillin was localized along with actin filaments where processes extended from the cell body and in neuritic growth cones. Furthermore, paxillin was tyrosine-phosphorylated in SH-SY5Y cells upon adhesion to laminin. Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled that of focal adhesion kinase and occurred as cell spreading, and neurite formation was initiated. Colchicine blocked neurite outgrowth but had no effect on cell spreading or on paxillin or focal adhesion kinase tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, cytochalasin D eliminated neurite outgrowth, cell spreading, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. These results show that paxillin is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon integrin ligand binding in neuronal cells.

Additionally, tyrosine kinase activity is associated with growth cone glycoproteins(9.Cheng N. Sahyoun N. J. Biol.

Wayner E.A. Srour M.L. Clegg D.O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that ECM-integrin binding results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in non-neuronal cells such as fibroblasts (13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). extracellular matrix focal adhesion kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media actin filaments laminin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis monoclonal antibody. Paxillin is another protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon ECM-integrin binding in fibroblasts(13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Paxillin binds to vinculin, α-actinin, and talin and therefore, like FAK, may help direct actin filament (F-actin)-membrane interactions(13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 14.Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Based on this background and the fact that changes in the actin cytoskeleton are required for neurite formation and growth cone guidance(2.Smith C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 384-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we suspected that paxillin might be tyrosine-phosphorylated during laminin-stimulated neurite outgrowth. Indeed, we found that adhesion to laminin induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in SH-SY5Y cells. Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be linked to F-actin redistribution during cell spreading and neurite formation and thus to the generation of a differentiated neuronal phenotype. We also found that, compared with undifferentiated cells, differentiated neuronal cells possess an increased level of paxillin protein. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum and were differentiated for 48-72 h with 10 μM retinoic acid(15.Rossino P. Defilippi P. Silengo L. Tarone G. Cell Regul. 1994; 2: 1021-1033Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% non-essential amino acids and were differentiated for 48 h with 5 mM dibutyryl cAMP(16.Kimhi Y. Palfrey C. Spector I. Barak Y. Littauer U.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). N1E-115 rat neuroblastoma cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and differentiated for 72 h with 1.5% Me2 SO(17.Chakraborty M. Anderson G.M. Chakraborty A. Chatterjee D. Brain Res. 1993; 625: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). LN-coated tissue culture plates were obtained from Collaborative-Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). SH-SY5Y cells were removed with trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in DMEM (serum free). Cells were then collected immediately or added to tissue culture plates. After 15-120 min, non-adherent cells were removed, and neurite outgrowth (percent of cells extending the process >10 μm) was determined in five random fields. As described previously(18.Leventhal P.S. Randolph A.E. Vesbit T.E. Schenone A. Windebank A.J. Feldman E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), cell lysates were then directly analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), or proteins were first immunoprecipitated from lysates (500 μg of protein/sample) using 4 μg/ml anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Transduction Laboratories), 10 μg/ml anti-FAK mAb 2A7 (gift of Dr. J. T. Parsons, University of Virginia), or 10 μg/ml polyclonal anti-FAK antibody BC3 (Upstate Biochemicals, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting was performed as described previously (18.Leventhal P.S. Randolph A.E. Vesbit T.E. Schenone A. Windebank A.J. Feldman E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using a combination of 1 μg/ml mAb PY20 (Transduction Laboratories) and 0.4 μg/ml mAb 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). For anti-paxillin immunoblotting, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with 25 ng/ml anti-paxillin mAb (Transduction Laboratories). Molecular mass was estimated by comparison with prestained molecular weight standards. SH-SY5Y cells were grown for 2 h on LN/polylysine-coated coverslips (Collaborative-Becton Dickinson). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100, and costained for F-actin and paxillin using 25 μg/ml anti-paxillin mAb and 3 units/ml rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Cells were imaged with a Nikon Diaphot microscope in conjunction with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser scanning confocal system. To explore the role of paxillin in neurons, we first examined the expression of this protein in neuronal cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1A, paxillin was expressed in the neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y (human), N1E-115 (rat), and Neuro-2a (mouse). On immunoblots, paxillin migrated as a doublet of ∼ 70-kDa proteins. This agrees with the characteristics of paxillin in non-neuronal cells(13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 14.Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In each cell line, neuronal differentiation increased the level of immunodetectable paxillin (Fig. 1B). We also examined the subcellular localization of paxillin in SH-SY5Y cells. Shown in panels A and B of Fig. 2 is a cell that is beginning to extend neurites and in panels C and D is a cell that has already extended neurites. In both cells, staining for paxillin (panels A and C) and F-actin (panels B and D) was most intense at the periphery of SH-SY5Y cells, especially in neuritic growth cones (panels C and D) or where processes extended from the cell body (panels A and B). Because paxillin is tyrosine-phosphorylated during ECM-integrin binding in fibroblasts(13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), we suspected that it would be tyrosine-phosphorylated in SH-SY5Y cells during the rapid outgrowth of neurites on LN(12.Choi E.S.-H. Rettig W.J. Wayner E.A. Srour M.L. Clegg D.O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15.Rossino P. Defilippi P. Silengo L. Tarone G. Cell Regul. 1994; 2: 1021-1033Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Analyses of whole cell lysates revealed two groups of proteins that were tyrosine-phosphorylated in LN adherent cells but not in suspension cells (Fig. 3). One set of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins migrated in the 110-135-kDa range. Another group migrated at ∼ 70 kDa, consistent with the characteristics of paxillin that we observed (see Fig. 1). An identical pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation was induced by adhesion to fibronectin (not shown). We next immunoprecipitated paxillin from SH-SY5Y cells in suspension and from LN-adherent SH-SY5Y cells to analyze its tyrosine phosphorylation more directly. We also compared the effect of cellular adhesion to uncoated plastic tissue culture plates wherein there is little cell spreading or neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4A). Finally, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, which typically accompanies paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation (13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 14.Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and has been reported to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in SH-SY5Y cells during LN-stimulated neurite outgrowth(11.Bozzo C. Defilippi P. Silengo L. Tarone G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In cells left in suspension, there was almost no detectable tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin or FAK (Fig. 4B). Adhesion to LN for 1 h greatly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin as well as FAK. Adhesion to plastic resulted in a lower level of FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, addition of 10 μg/ml soluble LN to SH-SY5Y cells did not stimulate these tyrosine phosphorylations (not shown). Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced within 15 min after addition of the cells to LN-coated tissue culture plates (Fig. 5A). The tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin reached a maximum 30-60 min after addition to the plates, and in some experiments, a slight decrease in the level of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was observed at the 2-h time point. This time course of paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled that of FAK. Time points earlier than 15 min were not analyzed because of weak cell adhesion. The level of paxillin and FAK in SH-SY5Y cells did not change during the course of these experiments (not shown). Rapid changes in morphology were readily observable by neurite outgrowth measurements (Fig. 5B). After 30 min, measurable neurite outgrowth (processes > 10 μm) was detected, and within 2 h over 80% of the cells had neurites. Adhesion of neuronal cells to LN results in a remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton as well as polymerization and redistribution of microtubules(2.Smith C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 384-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to address the relationship between paxillin and these cytoskeletal changes, we examined paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of colchicine, which inhibits microtubule polymerization(2.Smith C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 384-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also assessed the effects of cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin filaments(2.Smith C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 384-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of 10 μM colchicine had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin or FAK (Fig. 5C). However, 0.5 μM cytochalasin D eliminated the LN-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both paxillin and FAK. In contrast, both colchicine and cytochalasin D blocked LN-stimulated neurite outgrowth (Fig. 5D). Additionally, cytochalasin D reduced spreading of the cells on LN, whereas colchicine had no effect on cell spreading (not shown). Paxillin is a cytoskeletal protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated during growth factor-stimulated and integrin-mediated remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in non-neuronal cells such as fibroblasts(13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 14.Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we demonstrate that paxillin is also tyrosine-phosphorylated upon ECM-integrin binding in neuronal cells. This tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is not simply due to cell adhesion because cell attachment to plastic resulted in a much lower level of tyrosine phosphorylation than attachment to LN. In general, paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be related to both cell spreading and neurite formation, morphological changes that are necessary for the generation of a differentiated neuronal phenotype. Finally, consistent with a role for paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation in neurite formation and cell spreading, we found an enhanced level of paxillin in several chemically differentiated neuronal cell lines. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is necessary for neurite formation (2.Smith C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 384-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cell spreading (13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) while microtubule polymerization is required for elongation of neurites(2.Smith C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 384-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that colchicine blocked neurite outgrowth but had no effect on paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation suggests that the phosphorylation of paxillin is not dependent on later stages of neurite outgrowth that require microtubule polymerization. Rather, the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin appears to be associated with the redistribution of F-actin. First, cytochalasin D, a disrupter of F-actin(2.Smith C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 384-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), prevented laminin-stimulated neurite outgrowth and cell spreading and eliminated the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Second, we found that paxillin was colocalized with F-actin in SH-SY5Y cells. Third, paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation occurred as the cells spread on the substrate and began to form neurites, processes that are known to be driven by remodeling of F-actin(2.Smith C.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 384-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Finally, in fibroblasts, paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation is thought to help direct reorganization of F-actin(13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). FAK appears to play a related role in these cells because the time course and cytochalasin D sensitivity of FAK phosphorylation paralleled that of paxillin. Such a relationship between FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation has been identified in several non-neuronal cell lines(13.Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 14.Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because laminin-stimulated neurite outgrowth in SH-SY5Y cells is mediated by α1 β1 and α3 β1 integrins(12.Choi E.S.-H. Rettig W.J. Wayner E.A. Srour M.L. Clegg D.O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), these findings implicate paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation in integrin signaling by neuronal cells. It is clear, though, that paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation is not limited to a role in integrin-dependent neuronal differentiation because nerve growth factor has also been shown to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in PC12 cells(19.Khan M.A. Okumura N. Okada M. Kobayashi S. Nakagawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In agreement with our findings, the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in response to nerve growth factor is associated with F-actin redistribution(19.Khan M.A. Okumura N. Okada M. Kobayashi S. Nakagawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20.Melamed I. Turner C.E. Aktories K. Kaplan D.R. Gelfand E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These studies also support the idea that paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation is not strictly related to neuronal cell adhesion. In the SH-SY5Y cells, paxillin colocalized with F-actin in the growth cones, suggesting a possible role for paxillin in growth cone guidance. Likewise, vinculin, a protein that binds to paxillin and F-actin(14.Turner C.E. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), is concentrated in growth cones of PC12 cells(21.Arregui C.O. Carbonetto S. McKerracher L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6967-6977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore suspect that paxillin is one of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that has been identified in growth cones of Aplysia neurons (10.Wu D.Y. Goldberg D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 653-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In summary, paxillin expression is increased during neuronal differentiation. In parallel, paxillin is colocalized with F-actin in growth cones and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon adhesion to laminin. Laminin-stimulated paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation corresponded to the initiation of cell spreading and neurite formation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is clearly not only an integrin-mediated response as nerve growth factor also stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in PC12 cells(12.Choi E.S.-H. Rettig W.J. Wayner E.A. Srour M.L. Clegg D.O. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest a connection between paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and F-actin remodeling which, in turn, leads to cell spreading and neurite outgrowth and, thus, the expression of a differentiated neuronal phenotype.

In these cells, nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml) evoked a novel ~3-fold increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, while no measurable Ca2+ response was observed in wild type or mock-transfected cells lacking a functional trkA receptor. K-252a, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which prevents nerve growth factor-mediated responses in C6-2B cells expressing trkA, also blocked the rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration by nerve growth factor. Moreover, basic fibroblast growth factor, which in these cells elicits biochemical changes similar to nerve growth factor, failed to affect cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, further supporting the specificity of nerve growth factor/trkA receptor in mediating a Ca2+ response. While insensitive to chelation of extracellular Ca2+, the response was abolished following depletion of Ca2+ stores or blockade of intracellular Ca2+ release, providing strong evidence that intracellular Ca2+ is the main source for nerve growth factor-evoked cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration increase.

A great deal of information is now available on the various biological responses elicited by NGF. However, at present, the role played by either receptor component in the NGF signal transduction mechanism(s) as well as the second messenger(s) leading to specific NGF responses are still under investigation. Controversial results have been reported showing that a number of second messengers are affected by NGF, such as cAMP(7.Knipper M. Beck A. Rylett J.

The role of Ca2+ as a putative mediator of NGF responses has also been investigated; however, the data gathered so far are highly contradictory. The original report that NGF caused a small Ca2+ efflux (23.Schubert D. La Corbiere M. Whitlock C. Stallcup W. Nature. 1978; 273: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was not supported by subsequent studies (24.Landreth G. Cohen P. Shooter E.M. Nature. 1980; 283: 202-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Likewise, the more recent findings (25.Pandiella-Alonso A. Malgaroli A. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J.

Borden L.A. Greene L.A. Maxfield F. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, NGF has been proposed to increase Ca2+ uptake, possibly through a unique Ca2+ channel(28.Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci.

All of the above studies have been performed in PC12 cells (a pheochromocytoma cell line widely used as a model for studying NGF-induced responses) which express both low and high affinity NGF receptor components(30.Green S.H. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15316-15326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C6-2B cells, a rat glioma cell line expressing p75NGFR(31.Yakovlev A.G. DeBernardi M.A. Fabrazzo M. Brooker G. Costa E. Mocchetti I. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 116: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but devoid of the high affinity receptor trkA(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), are unresponsive to NGF. Upon stable transfection with trkA rat cDNA, C6-2B cells (C6trk+) exhibit novel NGF-mediated biochemical responses (c-fos induction and phosphorylation of trkA) and morphological changes (increased length of process extension)(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells, devoid of p75NGFR(9.Klein R. Jing S. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar), display a novel responsiveness to NGF when expressing trkA (trkA NIH3T3)(33.Cordon-Cardo C. Tapley P. Jing S.

Therefore, we reasoned that C6trk+ and trkA NIH3T3 cells could represent two useful models to evaluate the role played by either receptor component in the modulation of the intracellular Ca2+ dynamics by NGF. The data presented indicate that (i) in both C6trk+ and trkA NIH3T3 cell lines NGF increases [Ca2+]i by mobilizing intracellular Ca2+, and (ii) trkA, but not p75NGFR, is essential for the NGF-evoked Ca2+ response. C6-2B glioma cells (34.De Vellis J. Brooker G. Sato G. Tissue Cultures of the Nervous System. Plenum Press, New York1973: 231-245Google Scholar) were grown as monolayer cultures in Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% donor calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. C6-2B stably transfected with trkA cDNA (32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to maintain selective pressure. NIH3T3 cells overexpressing trkA receptor (a generous gift from Dr. D. R. Kaplan, NCI, Frederick, MD) were grown as described previously(33.Cordon-Cardo C. Tapley P. Jing S. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E.

Incubations with ATP, EGTA, dantrolene (Sigma), ionomycin (Calbiochem), thapsigargin (Research Biochemicals Inc., Natick, MA), NGF (Collaborative Research Inc., Bedford, MA), human recombinant basic FGF (Farmitalia Carlo Erba s.p.a., Milan, Italy), K-252a (a gift from Dr. G. Guroff, NICHHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were carried out in serum-free medium. Single cell fluorescence Ca2+ imaging was performed as described previously (35.DeErausquin G. Manev H. Guidotti A. Costa E. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using an Attofluor RatioVision digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments Inc., Rockville, MD). Briefly, cells were grown on 25-mm round, 1-mm thick glass coverslips and loaded with 5 μM cell-permeable acetoxymethylester of Fura-2 (Fura-2AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min at 37°C in serum-free Ham's F-10 medium buffered with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. Cells were washed, given 10 min to allow Fura-2 deesterification, and imaged in the same buffer either at room temperature or at 30-32°C with a Zeiss Axiovert TV 135 microscope and a 40× achrostigmat oil immersion objective. Fura-2 was excited at 334 and 380 nm with its emission monitored at 510-530 nm. The 334/380 nm excitation ratio increases as a function of the [Ca2+]i. Before each day's experiments, the instrument was calibrated (calibration was done in vitro with Fura-2 pentapotassium salt in the presence of high concentration of Ca2+ or EGTA), and the 334/380 nm excitation ratio was converted to [Ca2+]i values(35.DeErausquin G. Manev H. Guidotti A. Costa E. Brooker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8017-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For each experimental condition the [Ca2+]i response was studied in a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 32 coverslips with 10-50 cells/field being imaged in each coverslip. Cultures of C6trk+ cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) and lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, 20 μM leupeptin, 1 mM sodium vanadate) at 4°C. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with pan-trk polyclonal antibody at 4°C for 2 h as described previously(8.Kaplan D.R. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Science. 1991; 252: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The precipitate was then washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and water before resuspension in 10 μl of sample buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) for electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed overnight at 4°C with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 (Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY), diluted with Tris-buffered saline with a final concentration of 0.2% Tween 20. Blots were analyzed by using ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Lysates were prepared as described above. After removal of cellular debris by centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with pan-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) monoclonal antibody (Transduction Labs.) at 4°C for 2 h. The precipitate was then washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and water before resuspension in 10 μl of sample buffer as described above for electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed overnight at 4°C with monoclonal antibody PY20. Blots were analyzed as described above. Treatment with NGF (1-100 ng/ml) failed to elicit a measurable [Ca2+]i increase in either wild type (data not shown) or mock-transfected C6-2B cells (Fig. 1, open squares) expressing p75NGFR but lacking trkA(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, Ca2+ responses comparable to those previously described were observed when these cells were challenged with either ATP, a purinergic receptor agonist which, in C6-2B cells, has been shown to mobilize intracellular Ca2+(36.Munshi R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, open squares), or the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin (data not shown). Three independent C6trk+ cell clones were tested (nos. 41, 43, and 44) and found to display a novel [Ca2+]i increase upon exposure to NGF. Shown in Fig. 1(solid squares) is the Ca2+ response to NGF in cells from clone no. 43. Single cell fluorescence Ca2+ imaging revealed heterogeneity in the Ca2+ response such that, upon NGF treatment, 80% of the cells from clone no. 43, while only 20% of the cells from clone no. 41, displayed a measurable [Ca2+]i increase. For this reason, clone no. 43 was used in the majority of the experiments described in this study. The degree of NGF responsiveness among the three C6trk+ clones correlated with the degree of trkA mRNA expression in each clone, with clone no. 43 exhibiting higher levels of trkA mRNA than clone no. 41(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, the heterogeneity of Ca2+ responses is likely the result of the differential expression of trkA receptor in each clone. In line with this interpretation, it was also found that C6trk+ clone no. 43 responded to NGF with a greater induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of trkA and Erk, an NGF target protein(37.Tsao H. Aletta J.M. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15471-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), than clone no. 41 (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Induction of trkA and Erk tyrosine phosphorylation by NGF in two C6trk+ clones. C6trk+ cells from two separate clones (nos. 41 and 43) were incubated in serum-free medium in the absence(-) or presence (+) of 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 min at 37°C and then lysed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The lysates were immunoprecipitated with either pan-trk polyclonal (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or pan-Erk monoclonal (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. M= molecular mass standards in kDa. Lanes 1-4, clone no. 41; lanes 5-8, clone no. 43. The positions of trkA, Erk2, and IgG are indicated by the arrows on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Upon exposure to NGF (50 ng/ml), C6trk+ cells displayed a 3.0 ± 0.6-fold increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1). [Ca2+]i rise was delayed, showing a lag phase of about 30 s, relatively slow (t½ for NGF-induced peak of [Ca2+]i increase was 52.8 ± 9.1 s), and long lasting, with [Ca2+]i remaining elevated above resting levels (basal [Ca2+]i = 85 ± 18.6 nM) for at least 8 min. The lowest dose of NGF that yielded a measurable [Ca2+]i rise, although in a very exiguous number of cells (<2%), was 1 ng/ml (38 pM) (Fig. 3). The extent of the [Ca2+]i response evoked in these cells by 1 ng/ml NGF was about 58% of the maximal response elicited by 50 ng/ml NGF. The response reached a plateau at NGF doses of greater than 5 ng/ml (0.2 nM). Unless otherwise indicated, NGF working concentration used in all experiments was 50 ng/ml (2 nM). To investigate whether the NGF-evoked [Ca2+]i increase was of intracellular or extracellular origin, C6trk+ cells were challenged with NGF either in the absence or presence of EGTA. When the cells were pretreated with 2 mM EGTA for 30-90 s and then exposed to NGF always in the presence of EGTA, the peak [Ca2+]i was minimally affected (from an average of 250 ± 39 nM in the absence to 216 ± 48 nM in the presence of EGTA, Fig. 4). These data indicate that the NGF-evoked [Ca2+]i rise primary involves the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores rather than Ca2+ influx. However, while the rate of onset of the Ca2+ response was comparable in the absence and in presence of EGTA, the decay kinetics of [Ca2+]i were much faster in Ca2+ depleted medium than in Ca2+-containing medium with an apparent t½ for [Ca2+]i to return to resting levels of 85 ± 20 s and >181 s, respectively. This is consistent with the notion that a large component of the decay phase of the [Ca2+]i rise involves a capacitative entry of external Ca2+ triggered by the depletion of intracellular stores(38.Alonso M.T. Alavarez J. Montero M. Sanchez A. Garcia-Sancho J. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 39.Berridge M. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar). Further support for the hypothesis that intracellular Ca2+ is the main source for the peak response to NGF was provided by experiments in which either the internal stores were depleted of Ca2+ with the microsomal Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) (40.Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2997) Google Scholar) or the release of Ca2+ from the stores was blocked with dantrolene, a muscle relaxant widely used as an inhibitor of intracellular [Ca2+]i mobilization (36.Munshi R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Ward A. Chaffman M.O. Sorkin E.M. Drugs. 1986; 32: 130-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 42.De Bernardi M.A. Munshi R. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 451-458PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of C6trk+ cells to 100 nM TG elicited a [Ca2+]i increase similar in magnitude and kinetics to that previously described in wild type C6-2B cells(36.Munshi R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar, 42.De Bernardi M.A. Munshi R. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 451-458PubMed Google Scholar). When TG-pretreated cells were challenged with NGF (50-100 ng/ml), no increase in [Ca2+]i was observed (Fig. 5). Because the response to the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (5 μM) was unaffected by TG (Fig. 5), these data provide strong evidence that NGF increases [Ca2+]i by mobilizing the cation from intracellular stores. In line with the above results, when C6trk+ cells were exposed to NGF first and subsequently to ATP, which in C6-2B cells induces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation and releases Ca2+ from internal stores(36.Munshi R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar), the Ca2+ response to ATP was reduced by about 50% in those cells which had responded to NGF, compared to NGF-unresponsive cells (Fig. 6). Likewise, TG evoked a 2.6 ± 0.1-fold increase in [Ca2+]i in cells which previously responded to NGF, while it elicited a 5.7 ± 0.8-fold increase in NGF-unresponsive cells (n = 3). The results obtained with ATP and TG indicate that NGF evokes Ca2+ release from intracellular stores which are included in the IP3- and TG-sensitive Ca2+ pools. This is consistent with previous findings showing that, in PC12 cells, NGF induces hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (7.Knipper M. Beck A. Rylett J. Breer H FEBS Lett. 1993; 32: 147-152Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 19.Contreras M.L. Guroff G. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1466-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 43.Szeberenyi J. Erhardt P. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2105-2113PubMed Google Scholar) with consequent production of IP3 which is known to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores(39.Berridge M. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar). Last, dantrolene, which in C6-2B cells prevents the [Ca2+]i increase evoked by either agonists of receptors coupled to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis or TG(36.Munshi R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar, 42.De Bernardi M.A. Munshi R. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 451-458PubMed Google Scholar), abolished NGF-induced Ca2+ transient in C6trk+ cells without appreciably affecting the ability of ionomycin to elicit a Ca2+ entry response (Fig. 7).Figure 6:Effect of NGF on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by ATP. C6trk+ cells were exposed to NGF (50 ng/ml) and subsequently to ATP (100 μM). Data are the mean [Ca2+]i responses recorded from five cells which responded (open squares) and five cells which did not respond (solid squares) to NGF.

NGF (50 ng/ml) was then added and [Ca2+]i monitored. Ionomycin (5 μM) was also added to dantrolene-treated cells. A 6.3× objective was used to follow simultaneously the [Ca2+]i changes in 80-100 cells in a field. Data are the population means from one coverslip and are representative of six coverslips per experimental condition (80-100 cells/coverslip in a single field).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) K-252a, an alkaloid-like protein kinase inhibitor(44.Kase H. Iwahashi K. Nakanishi S. Matsuda Y. Yamada K. Takahashi M. Murakata C. Kato A. Kaneko M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 142: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), has been shown to specifically inhibit many of the actions of NGF in PC12 cells, including IP3 formation, increase in intracellular Ca2+, and neurite outgrowth(26.Lazarovici P. Levi B-Z. Lelkers P. Koizumi S. Fuijta K. Matsuda Y. Ozato K. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 23: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 45.Koizumi S. Contreras M.L. Matsuda Y. Hama T.

In C6trk+ cells, inhibition of trkA tyrosine phosphorylation activity by K-252a blocked NGF-elicited responses(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), such as c-fos induction and phosphorylation of trkA and suc-associated neurotrophic factor-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated target (SNT)(47.Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+]i increase evoked by NGF in C6trk+ cells appears to be mediated by the newly expressed trkA receptor, as neither wild type nor mock-transfected C6-2B cells (expressing p75NGFR but lacking trkA) respond to NGF with a [Ca2+]i rise. Therefore, we investigated whether the inhibition of the kinase activity associated with trkA, could affect the Ca2+ response to NGF. As shown in Fig. 8, pretreatment of C6trk+ cells with 200 nM K-252a for 20 min virtually abolished NGF-evoked [Ca2+]i rise. In K-252a-treated cells, TG did induce [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 8), although to a lesser extent than in K-252a-untreated cells (see Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8:, Figure 9: for comparison). A recent report shows that, in human fibroblasts, tyrosine kinase inhibitors affect the Ca2+ entry triggered by the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with TG(48.Lee K.M. Toscas K. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9945-9948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar effect by K-252a could account for the reduced TG response observed also in C6trk+ cells. bFGF is a well known trophic factor which exerts its biological effects by binding to a tyrosine kinase receptor(49.Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In C6trk+ cells, bFGF, similarly to NGF, elicits c-fos expression (32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and induces phosphorylation of various target proteins, such as SNT and Erk2 kinase (50.Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two trophic factors trigger a similar transduction pathway. In the attempt to characterize whether Ca2+ signaling, rather than being a common step in tyrosine kinase receptor activation, is unique for NGF, we investigated the effect of bFGF on the [Ca2+]i. Neither mock-transfected C6-2B nor C6trk+ cells displayed a measurable [Ca2+]i increase when challenged with bFGF (Fig. 9, A and B) at concentrations (10-50 ng/ml) which, in parallel experiments, were able to induce phosphorylation of PLC-γ or Erk2 kinase in both cell types (data not shown). Elevation of [Ca2+]i following addition of either ATP to C6-2B cells or NGF to C6trk+ cells was observed in the same cells previously exposed to bFGF (Fig. 9), suggesting that the mechanisms involved in Ca2+ mobilization were functional. Because C6trk+ cells also express p75NGFR(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the possibility exists that the low affinity receptor component might play a necessary or permissive role in the NGF-evoked trkA-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Therefore, the effect of NGF on the intracellular Ca2+ dynamics was evaluated in another cell line, trkA NIH3T3 cells which overexpress trkA but are devoid of p75NGFR(9.Klein R. Jing S. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 33.Cordon-Cardo C. Tapley P. Jing S. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Lamballe F. Kovary K. Klein K. Jones K.R. Reichardt L.F. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). trkA NIH3T3 cells responded to NGF with a ~3-fold increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 10). The Ca2+ response was similar in magnitude and kinetics to that observed in C6trk+ cells. Also, NGF increased [Ca2+]i even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 10A) while it failed to do so when internal Ca2+ stores were depleted with TG (Fig. 10B), suggesting that NGF mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ in trkA NIH3T3. These results, taken together, provide evidence that p75NGFR is not required for NGF-induced Ca2+ signaling. Similar to C6trk+ cells, the Ca2+ response appears to be a specific NGF-induced event rather than a result of generalized tyrosine kinase pathway activation because bFGF failed to increase [Ca2+]i in trkA NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). We have previously shown that C6-2B cells express only the low affinity component (p75NGFR) of the NGF receptor complex(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that trkA is required for the biological activity of NGF(14.Loeb D.M. Maragos J. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Parada L.F. Greene L.A. Cell. 1991; 66: 961-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15.Loeb D.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2919-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C6-2B cells are unresponsive to NGF, as demonstrated by the lack of induction of c-fos, phosphorylation of NGF target proteins, and morphological changes, following NGF treatment(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All of these responses, which are among NGF-mediated biological effects, can be observed in PC12 cells, an NGF responsive cell line expressing both trkA and p75NGFR receptors(30.Green S.H. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15316-15326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we have shown that wild type and mock-transfected C6-2B cells expressing p75NGFR but lacking a functional trkA receptor (32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) failed to display a measurable Ca2+ response upon NGF treatment. However, upon exposure to ATP, which in C6-2B cells mobilize Ca2+ from internal stores(36.Munshi R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar), or ionomycin, which induces Ca2+ entry, Ca2+ responses comparable to those previously described (36.Munshi R. De Bernardi M.A. Brooker G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1185-1191PubMed Google Scholar) were observed, implying that the lack of changes in the [Ca2+]i following NGF cannot be ascribed to inefficiency of the mechanisms involved in either intracellular Ca2+ release or Ca2+ influx. The novel expression of trkA in C6-2B cells induces NGF responsiveness(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). C6trk+ cells undergo a transient [Ca2+]i increase when exposed to NGF. Although the kinetics of the [Ca2+]i rise by NGF are similar to those previously described in PC12 cells(25.Pandiella-Alonso A. Malgaroli A. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), both the potency and the efficiency of NGF in increasing [Ca2+]i were greater in C6trk+ cells (+200% at ≥0.2 nM) than in PC12 cells (+50% at >3 nM). In C6trk+ cells, the expression of p75NGFR mRNA is nearly equivalent to that found in PC12 cells(30.Green S.H. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15316-15326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Yakovlev A.G. DeBernardi M.A. Fabrazzo M. Brooker G. Costa E. Mocchetti I. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 116: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), while trkA mRNA levels are at least 5-10-fold higher than in PC12 cells(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the overexpression of the newly synthesized high affinity receptor in C6trk+ cells could explain the greater Ca2+ response evoked by NGF in these cells compared to PC12 cells. Previous findings in PC12 cells showed that the small and transient increase in [Ca2+]i evoked by NGF was mainly due to Ca2+ entry(25.Pandiella-Alonso A. Malgaroli A. Vicentini L.M. Meldolesi J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28.Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), possibly through a unique Ca2+ channel(29.Nikodijevic B. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our study shows that NGF evokes an increases in [Ca2+]i also in Ca2+-depleted medium, but it fails to do so when intracellular Ca2+ cannot be mobilized due to either depletion of the stores with TG or blockade of the release from the stores with dantrolene. We therefore propose that, in C6trk+ cells, NGF elicits [Ca2+]i rise by causing intracellular Ca2+ mobilization rather than extracellular Ca2+ influx. However, we cannot rule out the involvement of Ca2+ channels in the NGF mediated [Ca2+]i rise in other systems because C6-2B cells do not express functional voltage dependent Ca2+ channels as KCl depolarization failed to change [Ca2+]i. ( 2M. A. De Bernardi, S. J. Rabin, A. M. Colangelo, G. Brooker, and I. Mocchetti, unpublished results.) The exact mechanism utilized by NGF in evoking Ca2+ response does not appear to be easily definable. In C6trk+ cells, K-252a, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity associated with trkA(12.Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 51.Tapley P. Lamballe F. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 371-381PubMed Google Scholar), blocked NGF-evoked [Ca2+]i rise. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the novel Ca2+ response to NGF observed in C6trk+ cells is mediated by trkA. NGF stimulates phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ on tyrosine as well as serine residues (52.Kim U-H. Fink Jr., D. Kim H.S. Park D.J. Contreras M. Guroff G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1359-1362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by a kinase activity associated with trkA (53.Vetter M.L. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Bishop J.M. Kaplan D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5650-5654Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Activated phospholipase C-γ is known to lead to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis with accumulation of diacylglycerol and IP3. The latter, acting at receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum, induces release of Ca2+(39.Berridge M. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar), suggesting that phospholipase C-γ signaling might mediate the NGF-evoked [Ca2+]i rise. However, bFGF, which, similarly to NGF, activates phospholipase C-γ in C6trk+ and trk NIH3T3 cells (data not shown), failed to induce an appreciable Ca2+ response in these same cells. Thus, it appears that [Ca2+]i rise is a unique response to trkA activation. Interestingly enough, in C6trk+ cells, NGF elicits morphological changes and is a weaker mitogen than bFGF(32.Colangelo A.M. Fink D.W. Rabin S.J. Mocchetti I. Glia. 1994; 12: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, although only speculative at present, the hypothesis that [Ca2+]i rise elicited by NGF could be a crucial player in triggering the cascade of molecular events leading to cell differentiation is appealing. Recent data have shown that, although p75NGFR is not required for NGF biological activity(54.Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany Y.G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.R. Persson H. Cell. 1992; 69: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the low affinity receptor appears to be involved in the binding of NGF and signal transduction of trkA(55.Hempstead B.L.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 733-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). From our results, trkA appears to be solely responsible and sufficient for NGF-evoked [Ca2+]i increase since Ca2+ signaling triggered by NGF occurs also in trkA NIH3T3 cells lacking p75NGFR. In a recent report(7.Knipper M. Beck A. Rylett J. Breer H FEBS Lett. 1993; 32: 147-152Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), p75NGFR has been proposed to mediate, through a pertussis toxin sensitive G-protein, the increase in cAMP accumulation caused by NGF in PC12 cells. p75NGFR is also involved in the NGF-mediated activation of sphingomyelin cycle(60.Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Thus, p75NGFR might be involved in signal transduction pathways other then Ca2+, while trkA in signaling other then cAMP. Interestingly, and in agreement with our interpretation, K-252a blocked NGF-induced IP3 accumulation(7.Knipper M. Beck A. Rylett J. Breer H FEBS Lett. 1993; 32: 147-152Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 45.Koizumi S. Contreras M.L. Matsuda Y. Hama T. Lazarovici P. Guroff G. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 715-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while it did not affect the NGF-elicited cAMP formation(7.Knipper M. Beck A. Rylett J. Breer H FEBS Lett. 1993; 32: 147-152Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that (i) NGF is able to largely modulate [Ca2+]i by a mechanism which involves mobilization of intracellullar Ca2+ and (ii) trkA and not p75NGFR is required and sufficient to mediate this response. Important questions which could be addressed using C6trk+ cells as a model include the relationship (if any) between Ca2+ signal and morphological changes, as well as cell differentiation. We thank Dr. D. R. Kaplan for trkA NIH3T3 cells and for pan-trk antibody, and Dr. G. Guroff for K-252a."

It frequently occurs in developing countries, causes amebic dysentery, and may lead to the formation of tumor-like abscesses in liver and spleen(1.Walsh J.A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1986; 8: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). As to its cell biology, E. histolytica is a low eukaryote that lacks mitochondria and a well defined endoplasmatic reticulum/Golgi apparatus. Morphologically conspicuous is the enormous amount of vacuoles in the amebae. These occupy about 40% of the total cell volume and are functionally equivalent to both the lysosomes and the cytotoxic vesicles of higher eukaryotic cells(2.Löhden U. Bakker-Grunwald T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3.Bakker-Grunwald T. Coombs G. North M. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis, London1991: 367-376Google Scholar). Besides its function in cellular metabolism, protein degradation is essential for a range of regulatory processes and for the elimination of unstable or abnormal proteins(4.Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the last decade, new insights have emerged into the mechanisms of intracellular protein metabolism. Generally, there appear to be two major pathways for protein degradation: one is lysosomal and employs the action of thiol- and aspartyl-dependent cathepsins (5.Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and the other is cytosolic and functions with the aid of high molecular weight proteases. The latter are represented by the Lon and ClpAP proteases in prokaryotes and the 20 S proteasome or multicatalytic protease (MCP), ( 1The abbreviations used are: MCPmulticatalytic proteaseCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidE-64epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butaneSuc-LLVY-MCAsuccinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amideN-t-Boc-LSTR-MCAN-tert-butoxycarbony-leucyl-seryl-threonyl-arginyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) which is the proteolytic core of a 26 S protease, in eukaryotes(4.Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The 20 S proteasome has also been found in some Archaea(7.Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) and in at least one Eubacterium(8.Lupas A. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 533-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Protein degradation by Lon, ClpAP, and the 26 S protease is ATP dependent, and protein substrates generally have to be ubiquitinated prior to degradation by the 26 S protease(9.Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). By contrast, small peptides are cleaved by Lon, ClpP, and the 20 S protease in the absence of ATP and, as to the latter, without the need for ubiquitin tagging(10.McGuire M.J. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 873: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consequently, fluorogenic peptides have been used for screening purposes and as model substrates to probe the specificity of these high molecular weight proteases(11.Chu-Ping M. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12.Tanaka K. Ii K. Ichihara A. Waxman L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15197-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For proteasomes, the pattern of activity toward the different substrates is variable. In particular, upon stimulation by γ-interferon, mammalian proteasomes exhibit an increase in chymotryptic activity, which may serve to generate peptides for antigen presentation and appears to be due both to the replacement of certain proteasomal β-subunits by others and to an enhanced response to activator protein(6.Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 13.Ustrell V. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14.Frentzel S. Pesold-Hurt B. Seelig A. Kloetzel P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of an archaeal 20 S proteasome, which should be similar to its eukaryotic counterpart, has recently been solved(7.Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). It consists of four stacked rings with seven subunits each: two rings of 22.3-kDa β-subunits sandwiched between two rings of 25.8-kDa α-subunits. Remarkably, the bacterial ClpP seems to possess a similar 7-fold symmetry(15.Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The active site residue of the proteasome has been identified as a β-chain threonine both by site-directed mutagenesis (16.Seemüller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Löwe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and by N-terminal modification(17.Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar).In E. histolytica, a range of cysteine proteinases of the papain type has been extensively characterized both on the genomic and on the protein level(18.Scholze H. Coombs G. North M. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis, London1991: 251-256Google Scholar, 19.McKerrow J.H. Bouvier J. Sikes A. Reed S. Keene W.E. Coombs G. North M. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis, London1991: 245-250Google Scholar). These enzymes are localized in the lysosome-like vacuoles mentioned above. By contrast, nothing is known yet about cytoplasmic protein degradation in this organism or about the proteases involved. In this study, we present evidence indicating that E. histolytica contains both proteasomes and a novel, unrelated high molecular weight protease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureE. histolytica, strain HM1:IMSS, was cultured at 37°C in TYI-S-33 medium (20.Diamond L.S. Ravdin J.I. Amebiasis. Human Infection by Entamoeba histolytica. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 27-40Google Scholar) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. After 3 days, cells were chilled on ice and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64 (final concentration, 0.1 μM) and disrupted by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the supernatant (soluble extract) was used for further experiments.Peptidase and Protease AssaysRoutinely, peptidolytic activity was measured with Suc-LLVY-MCA as a substrate(21.Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. Ikai A. Nishigai M. Kameyama K. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16209-16217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a fluorescence cuvette, 10 μl of substrate (5 mM dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide), up to 40 μl of 1% (w/v) SDS, and 5-20 μl of sample were added to 1 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, at 25°C. The rate of release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was determined by following the increase of fluorescence at 380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. The cleavage of N-t-Boc-LSTR-MCA was determined under identical conditions. With benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-leucyl-glutamyl-2-naphthylamide as substrate (end concentration, 0.1 mM), wavelengths were adjusted to 333 nm excitation and 410 nm emission, respectively(11.Chu-Ping M. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Proteolytic activity was determined at 37°C with azocasein (final concentration, 10 mg/ml) as a substrate(22.Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar).Density Gradient CentrifugationSucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed in 37-ml polyallomer tubes using a swing rotor (SW 28, Beckman). Soluble extract containing E-64 was loaded onto a linear gradient of 15-40% sucrose and centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 42 h at 4°C. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed for enzymatic activity and protein content.Purification of the 11 S PeptidaseSoluble extract containing E-64 was applied onto a column of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman; bed volume, 30 ml) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in the same buffer. Suc-LLVY-MCA hydrolyzing activity was desorbed at about 220 mM NaCl (Fig. 1A). Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Filtron), and subjected to gel filtration by fast protein liquid chromatography using Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; bed volume, 120 ml) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.1 M NaCl. As shown in Fig. 1B, fractions containing peptide-hydrolyzing activity eluted as a major peak followed by a second peak of lower activity at higher retention time. The active fractions of the major peak were equilibrated to 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, by ultrafiltration and dilution and then submitted to fast protein liquid chromatography anion exchange chromatography over a MonoQ column equilibrated with the same buffer. The protease was eluted by a broken linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl as indicated in Fig. 1C and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min over a time range of 55 min. Fractions containing Suc-LLVY-MCA hydrolyzing activity, which desorbed at about 240 mM NaCl, were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and chromatographed twice on a Superose 6 column (bed volume, 24 ml) with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.1 M NaCl. As shown in Fig. 1D, the Suc-LLVY-MCA cleaving fractions corresponded to a distinct peak of protein absorption and were clearly separated from a residual impurity of lower retention time. These fractions were concentrated and stored at −20°C in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8.Analytical Molecular Sieve ChromatographyThe apparent molecular weight of the native 11 S enzyme was determined by molecular sieve chromatography over Sephacryl S-300 after calibration of the column with the high molecular weight standards thyroglobulin (Mr 669,000), apoferritin (Mr 443,000), catalase (Mr 240,000), and aldolase (Mr 158,000).Electron MicroscopyDrops of the purified 11 S protease were applied to carbon film-covered glow-discharged grids and negatively stained with aqueous 1% uranyl acetate(23.Peters J.-M. Cejka Z. Harris J.R. Kleinschmidt J.A. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were recorded with a Philips EM 420.Gel ElectrophoresesSDS-PAGE was carried out in 15% polyacrylamide gels according to (24.Douglas M. Finkelstein D. Butow R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 734-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Native gels (7.5% polyacrylamide) were run at 4°C with a Tris/glycine system, pH 8.9, according to (25.Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15919) Google Scholar). The Suc-LLVY-MCA hydrolyzing activity was detected by overlaying the gel strip with 2 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 40 μl of a 5 mM substrate solution, and visualizing the fluorescence of the released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin on a UV fluorescent table equipped with a 354-nm lamp.N-terminal SequencingThe purified 11 S enzyme was subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The protein band was cut out and N-terminally sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer.ImmunoblottingGels were blotted on nitrocellulose sheets in 0.1 M CAPS-HCl, pH 11.5, and the immunoreaction was performed according to a protocol of Hoefer Scientific Instruments. Antibodies against proteasomes of Thermoplasma acidophilum, Dictyostelium discoideum, and rat proteasome were kindly provided by A. Grziwa and M. Nesper (Martinsried) and B. Dahlmann (Düsseldorf), respectively. The MCP231 antibody against proteasome α-chains (26.Hendil K.B. Kristensen P. Uerkvitz W. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of K. Hendil (Copenhagen).RESULTSIdentification of Two High Molecular Weight ProteasesTo test for the presence of non-thiol proteases in E. histolytica, a soluble amebic extract (100,000 × g supernatant) containing the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64 was incubated with the fluorogenic chymotrypsin substrate, Suc-LLVY-MCA. A release of fluorophore could readily be observed. As shown in Fig. 2, this peptidolytic activity was stimulated by over 60% by SDS, with an optimum at an SDS concentration of about 0.4 mg/ml. Beyond the optimum, the curve exhibited a flat declining plateau and then decreased steeply at concentrations exceeding 0.8 mg/ml SDS.Figure 2:Effect of SDS on Suc-LLVY-MCA hydrolyzing activity in amebic extract. Samples were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of SDS, and enzyme activity was measured fluorimetrically as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are given as percent activity of a control without SDS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Stimulation of peptidolytic activity by SDS has typically been found for proteasomes(27.Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Ichihara A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to investigate whether these complexes were present in E. histolytica. To this end, a soluble amebal extract was subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the fractions were tested for chymotryptic activity. As shown in Fig. 3(closed circles), two Suc-LLVY hydrolyzing peaks with sedimentation velocities of approximately 11 and 20 S were clearly separated. Only the second peak exhibited significant activity toward the tryptic substrate, BOC-LSTR-MCA (Fig. 3, open squares). The SDS-electrophoretic pattern of the 20 S peak (Fig. 3, inset A) was restricted to a series of bands between 25 and 30 kDa and roughly corresponded to that found for proteasomes from a number of organisms(21.Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. Ikai A. Nishigai M. Kameyama K. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16209-16217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the 11 S fraction exhibited bands over a much wider range (data not shown) and obviously contained a crude mixture of proteins. In immunoblot experiments, we tested the reactions of a cell homogenate and of the 11 and 20 S peaks with an antibody (MCP231) against a sequence motif common to α-chains of proteasomes(26.Hendil K.B. Kristensen P. Uerkvitz W. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, inset B, the 20 S peak (lane 3) exhibited a series of cross-reacting bands around 30 kDa. By contrast, neither the 11 S fraction (lane 2) nor the purified 11 S protease (lane 1; see below) cross-reacted with the antibody. These findings indicated that E. histolytica contained both 20 S proteasomes and an 11 S peptidase.Figure 3:Density gradient centrifugation of a soluble amebic extract. •, Suc-LLVY-MCA hydrolyzing activity; □, Boc-LSTR-MCA hydrolyzing activity.

To distinguish between these two possibilities, we set out to purify and characterize the 11 S enzyme. Purification was achieved by two anion exchange and two molecular sieve chromatography steps (Fig. 1; Table 1). Overall, specific activity toward the chymotrypsin peptide substrate went up by a factor 320, and 730 mg of protein (from approximately 5 × 108 amebae) yielded about 100 μg of peptidase (Table 1). To test for the purity of the isolated enzyme, an aliquot was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Under these conditions, the protein appeared as a single band with an apparent Mr of 62,000 (Fig. 4A, right) and yielded a single N-terminal sequence; this sequence (DNXVNVKNQLS) did not exhibit significant similarity to any other N-terminal sequence in the EMBL data base. Under non-denaturing conditions, the enzyme migrated as a single, peptidolytically active complex between the marker proteins catalase (Mr 240,000) and apoferritin (Mr 443,000; Fig. 4A, left). In agreement both with this observation and with its sedimentation constant, we determined its apparent Mr by molecular sieve chromatography as 385,000 ± 10% (n = 3; see “Experimental Procedures”). Finally, under weakly denaturing conditions (1 mg/ml SDS, no boiling or reduction) the protein, which was still peptidolytically active, exhibited an apparent Mr of about 180,000 (Fig. 4A, middle). From these data, we infer that the native protease is probably composed of six identical or very similar subunits of 60-65 kDa. Under weakly denaturing conditions, three of these subunits remained associated as a metastable, active trimer half the size of the native complex. A cartoon illustrating these inferred relationships is given in Fig. 4B. An electron micrograph of the purified 11 S protease revealed compact particles with an average diameter of about 9 nm (Fig. 5).Tabled 1Figure 4:Gel electrophoresis of the purified 11 S protease and interpretation of the data.

Table 2 lists its relative activity toward a range of fluorogenic substrates. It can be seen that the enzyme had relatively high chymotryptic activity (i.e. it preferred aromatic residues at the P1 position), much lower trypsin-like activity (Arg at the P1 position; see also Fig. 1), and did not accept any of the other peptides offered as a substrate. In particular, whereas the rough extract had considerable peptidylglutamyl peptidase activity (up to 20% of the chymotryptic activity; data not shown), the purified enzyme lacked this activity altogether. Table 3 presents the kinetic parameters of the 11 S enzyme toward the chymotrypsin substrate. Both Km and Vmax were within the range reported for proteasomes(10.McGuire M.J. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 873: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13.Ustrell V. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The 11 S enzyme also acted as a protease, albeit a rather inefficient one (Table 4). It shares this latter property with 20 S proteasomes(10.McGuire M.J. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 873: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); we suppose that, as with proteasomes, its proteolytic activity may in vivo be activated by accessory proteins. The pH optimum of both peptidolytic and proteolytic activity (a broad optimum around 6.0-7.0; data not shown) was lower than that of proteasomes (≥8; e.g.(28.Scholze H. Tannich E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 512-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), Fig. 5). In agreement with its specificity, the enzyme was completely inhibited by chymostatin, a chymotrypsin inhibitor (Table 5). Also the calpain inhibitor I was very effective, much more so than the other inhibitors of serine and cysteine proteases that we tested. Whereas EDTA and ATP had no or little effect, enzyme activity increased by about 40% in the presence of MgCl2 or CaCl2 (both at 10 mM; Table 5). Under all conditions tested, activity was increased up to 2-fold by the addition of 0.4 mg/ml SDS (data not shown).Tabled 1Tabled 1Tabled 1Tabled 1DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified two high molecular weight (11 and 20 S) proteases in E. histolytica. The heavier enzyme appears proteasome-like both from its subunit composition and from its cross-reactivity with an antibody against proteasomal α-subunits. By contrast, the lighter enzyme exhibited several novel characteristics. Clearly, its activity cannot be ascribed to the vesicular cysteine proteinases described in a series of earlier reports (18.Scholze H. Coombs G. North M. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis, London1991: 251-256Google Scholar, 19.McKerrow J.H. Bouvier J. Sikes A. Reed S. Keene W.E. Coombs G. North M. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis, London1991: 245-250Google Scholar) because it was not inhibited by E-64, a specific inhibitor of these enzymes. In addition, its high molecular weight and its substrate specificity (preferred cleavage of the peptide bond of hydrophobic residues at the P1 position) distinguish this enzyme from the known amebic proteases histolysain and amebapain, which favor arginine in P1 and P2(28.Scholze H. Tannich E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 512-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also, although peptidolytic activity was effectively inhibited by a calpain inhibitor and stimulated by Ca2+ (Table 5), we obviously were not dealing with a calpain, as these enzymes have a very different subunit composition and are blocked by EDTA and E-64(29.Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). We originally thought the 11 S enzyme might correspond to part (specifically, to the β-core) of the proteasome. Indeed, apart from its complete lack of peptidylglutamyl activity, the substrate specificity, kinetics, and effector profile of the 11 S enzyme (Table 2-V) were not that different from those found for proteasomes; SDS at low concentrations stimulated activity to a comparable degree, and in electron-optical images the 11 S complex had a similar diameter (Fig. 5). However, a very strong argument against the 11 S enzyme being part of the proteasome is its radically different subunit composition (identical or very similar 62-kDa subunits rather than a range of bands between 25 and 30 kDa). Of course, we cannot at present exclude a distant relationship between the two complexes. For instance, the 62-kDa subunits might be the product of natural gene duplications of sequences coding for far relatives (with deviating N-terminal ends) of proteasomal β-chains. However, the inferred symmetry of the 11 S particle (3-fold rather than 7-fold, see Fig. 4B) would seem to argue even against a distant relationship. Evidence has recently been reported (30.Hua S. Li X. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10264-10271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) that Trypanosoma brucei, another parasitic protozoon that branched off relatively early from the main eukaryotic line(31.Sogin M.L. Am. Zool. 1989; 29: 487-499Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar), contains a high molecular weight protease that migrates faster than mammalian 20 S proteasomes and that exhibits a deviating substrate specificity. This enzyme could possibly be related to the E. histolytica 11 S protease. INTRODUCTIONEntamoeba histolytica is a parasitic protozoon that resides in the human gut. It frequently occurs in developing countries, causes amebic dysentery, and may lead to the formation of tumor-like abscesses in liver and spleen(1.Walsh J.A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1986; 8: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). As to its cell biology, E. histolytica is a low eukaryote that lacks mitochondria and a well defined endoplasmatic reticulum/Golgi apparatus. Morphologically conspicuous is the enormous amount of vacuoles in the amebae. These occupy about 40% of the total cell volume and are functionally equivalent to both the lysosomes and the cytotoxic vesicles of higher eukaryotic cells(2.Löhden U. Bakker-Grunwald T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 3.Bakker-Grunwald T. Coombs G. North M. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor & Francis, London1991: 367-376Google Scholar). Besides its function in cellular metabolism, protein degradation is essential for a range of regulatory processes and for the elimination of unstable or abnormal proteins(4.Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the last decade, new insights have emerged into the mechanisms of intracellular protein metabolism. Generally, there appear to be two major pathways for protein degradation: one is lysosomal and employs the action of thiol- and aspartyl-dependent cathepsins (5.Dice J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and the other is cytosolic and functions with the aid of high molecular weight proteases. The latter are represented by the Lon and ClpAP proteases in prokaryotes and the 20 S proteasome or multicatalytic protease (MCP), ( 1The abbreviations used are: MCPmulticatalytic proteaseCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidE-64epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butaneSuc-LLVY-MCAsuccinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amideN-t-Boc-LSTR-MCAN-tert-butoxycarbony-leucyl-seryl-threonyl-arginyl-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) which is the proteolytic core of a 26 S protease, in eukaryotes(4.Gottesman S.

The C4 and S1 mutants contain a single amino acid substitution in the largest and second largest subunits, respectively. Compared with wild type, C4 had a lower elongation rate and was less efficient at reading through intrinsic elongation blocks. S1 had a higher elongation rate than wild type and was more efficient at reading through the same blocks. During elongation, C4 and wild type responded similarly to DmS-II and NH4+, whereas the S1 mutant was less responsive to both. Differences between the two mutants also appeared during DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage and pyrophosphorolysis. During extended pyrophosphorolysis, S1 polymerase was fastest and C4 polymerase was slowest at generating the final pattern of shortened transcripts. S1 and wild type were equal in the rate of extended DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage, and C4 was slower. Our results suggest that the S1 mutation increases the time spent by the polymerase in elongation competent mode and that the C4 mutation may affect the movement of the polymerase.

Our results suggest that the S1 mutation increases the time spent by the polymerase in elongation competent mode and that the C4 mutation may affect the movement of the polymerase. Recent studies have revealed that the control of transcription elongation is an important target for the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression(1.Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kerppola T.M. Kane C.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2833-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As the central component of the mRNA transcription machinery, RNA polymerase II itself is the final receptor of various kinds of interactions that activate or inactivate transcription elongation, and it carries out the fundamental catalysis of RNA chain elongation. However, functional roles played by its individual subunits during the process of elongation have not been thoroughly illuminated. A number of mutations in RpII215 and RpII140, the genes encoding the two large subunits of Drosophila RNA polymerase II have been mapped at the DNA sequence level. Among them, the C4 mutation in RpII215 changes amino acid 741 from Arg to His in the largest subunit(3.Chen Y. Weeks J. Mortin M.A. Greenleaf A.L. MCB. 1993; 13: 4214-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the S1 mutation in RpII140 changes amino acid 728 from Ser to Cys in the second largest subunit(4.Kim W.J. Burke L.P. Mortin M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In vivo, the C4 mutation induces α-amanitin resistance and the Ubx effect(5.Greenleaf A.L. Weeks J.R. Voelker R.A. Ohnishi S. Dickson B. Cell. 1980; 21: 785-792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6.Mortin M.A. Kim W.J. Huang J. Genetics. 1988; 119: 863-873PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the S1 mutation suppresses the temperature-sensitive mutant phenotype caused by another mutation (WJK1) in the largest subunit(7.Mortin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4864-4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Little is known about what functions of RNA polymerase II are altered and how transcription is affected by these and other mapped mutations, except that it was shown previously that the C4 mutant enzyme is resistant to α-amanitin and is slower in elongation in vitro(8.Coulter D.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1945-1952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Coulter D.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13190-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Having previously mapped mutations in both RpII215 and RpII140, we next initiated biochemical studies of a subset of the mutant enzymes that are amenable to purification(10.Chen, Y. 1995 Structural and Functional Studies of Drosophila RNA Polymerase II Mutants. Ph.D. thesis, Duke UniversityGoogle Scholar). In our studies, we found that as for the C4 mutant enzyme, the S1 mutant enzyme is also different from wild type in elongation. Because the C4 mutation alters the largest subunit, whereas the S1 mutation alters the second largest subunit of Drosophila RNA polymerase II, the availability of C4 and S1 RNA polymerase II mutant enzymes provides an opportunity possibly to identify functional roles for the two large subunits during elongation and to dissect the molecular mechanism by which RNA polymerase II achieves efficient elongation. Using cell-free transcription systems in which elongation complexes can be assembled, a number of factors have been identified that affect elongation properties of RNA polymerase II. For example, the Drosophila transcription factor, DmS-II, which was initially purified from Drosophila Kc cell nuclear extracts, has been shown to have a stimulatory effect on elongation in vitro(11.Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8963-8969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). DmS-II is a 36-kDa protein that is the Drosophila counterpart for mammalian S-II (TFIIS); the gene encoding DmS-II has been cloned and sequenced(13.Marshall T.K. Guo H. Price D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6293-6298Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DmS-II has been shown to reduce the time spent by RNA polymerase II at a subset of the numerous pause sites encountered on a dC-tailed ( 1The abbreviations used are: dCpolydeoxycytidineDTTdithiothreitolROrun-off transcript(s)CTDC-terminal repeat domain.) template, but it does not stably bind to the elongation complex(11.Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8963-8969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DmS-II has also been shown to be necessary and sufficient to activate nascent transcript cleavage by Drosophila RNA polymerase II during transcription of a dC-tailed template, and the C-terminal half of DmS-II is required for its cleavage-activating function. A mechanism for pause suppression by DmS-II has been proposed. DmS-II binds to the paused polymerase, causes one cleavage event, and is then released from the complex. Elongation by the polymerase then allows a second encounter with the pause site and a second chance of passing the site. Complete pause suppression may require multiple transcript shortening events for some polymerase molecules(14.Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18762-18770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). polydeoxycytidine dithiothreitol run-off transcript(s) C-terminal repeat domain. In the study presented here, we investigate several elongation-related properties of wild type and mutant RNA polymerase II, namely recognition of intrinsic blocks to elongation, read-through in response to DmS-II, DmS-II-stimulated cleavage of nascent transcripts, and pyrophosphorolysis. We demonstrate that the C4 and S1 mutations affect different functional processes during elongation, and we discuss the implications of our observations. Polymin P was purchased from ICN Biochemicals. Lyophilized ribonucleoside triphosphates were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. α-Amanitin, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and restriction enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [5′,6′-3H]UTP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]CTP were purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. Miracloth was purchased from Chicopee Mills. DNA size standards 50-2000-base pair ladder, 5.0-ml Econo-Pac heparin column, and Bio-Spin 30 columns were purchased from Bio-Rad. DEAE cellulose (DE52 pre-swollen cellulose) was from Whatman. 1.0-ml Mono-Q fast protein liquid chromatography column was from Pharmacia. All other materials were reagent grade. RNA polymerase II was purified from P2, C4, and S1 embryos, respectively. Embryos were collected from expanded stocks at 12-h intervals, dechorionated, and quickly frozen for later use(15.Greenleaf A.L. Borsett L.M. Jiamachello P.F. Coulter D.E. Cell. 1979; 18: 613-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Embryo buffer was 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 15 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, plus 1 mM DTT, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (saturated solution in isopropanol at 25°C), 1 mM sodium bisulfite (Na2S2O5), and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, which were added immediately before each use. HGE was 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 15% glycerol, and 0.1 mM EDTA, plus additions described above for embryo buffer. HGKE was HGE plus KCl of indicated concentration. HGAE was HGE plus (NH4)2SO4 of indicated concentration. All purification steps were carried out at 0-4°C. Frozen dechorionated embryos (50 g) were suspended in 100 ml of embryo buffer and homogenized using a Waring blender for 45 s at low speed and 30 s at high speed. Following the addition of 100 ml of HGE, homogenization was continued for 45 s each at low and high speed. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (16,000 × g) for 30 min in a GSA rotor (Sorvall), and the resulting supernatant was collected after being filtered through one layer of Miracloth. One hundredth volume of a 10% (w/v) solution of Polymin P was stirred in dropwise. After 20 min of gentle stirring, the precipitated material was collected by centrifugation in the GSA rotor at 8,500 rpm (12,000 × g) for 20 min. The polymin P precipitate was washed in 50 ml of 0.1 M HGKE using a glass-glass Dounce homogenizer to obtain uniform resuspension, followed by recentrifugation at 8,000 rpm (10,000 × g) for 20 min in the GSA rotor. RNA polymerase II activity was then extracted from the pellet into 50 ml of 0.3 M HGAE using a Dounce homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (25,000 × g) for 20 min in the SA-600 rotor (Sorvall). The resulting polymin P eluate was filtered through one layer of Miracloth. Solid (NH4)2SO4 (0.3 g/ml of polymin P eluate) was added and dissolved in by gentle stirring over 30-40 min. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm (140,000 × g) for 30 min in a T-865 ultracentrifuge rotor (Sorvall). The pellet was resuspended in 10-15 ml of HGE with a Dounce homogenizer to yield ammonium sulfate enzyme, which was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The thawed ammonium sulfate enzyme was loaded onto a 30-ml DE-52 column equilibrated in 0.12 M HGAE and was eluted with a 0.3 M HGAE step. The peak of RNA polymerase II activity was pooled and was loaded onto a 5.0 ml Econo-Pac heparin column equilibrated in 0.18 M HGAE, and was eluted with a 0.5 M HGAE step. The RNA polymerase II activity peak was pooled and loaded onto a 1.0 ml Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated in 0.15 M HGKE. After extensive washing of the column with 0.15 M HGKE, the enzyme was eluted with a 22.5 ml 0.15 M to 0.6 M HGKE gradient. RNA polymerase II activity eluted around 0.45 M KCl and was collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. RNA polymerase II activity (in units) was determined for each enzyme preparation under standard assay conditions(16.Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3244-3255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that under these conditions wild type and S1 enzymes have almost identical specific activities and that the C4 enzyme's specific activity is approximately 40% lower (e.g.(9.Coulter D.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13190-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and “Results”). Full-length DmS-II was expressed and purified as described in Guo and Price(14.Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18762-18770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pPCP was constructed by subcloning a EcoRI-BamHI fragment containing the Drosophila actin 5C promoter into the pSP73 vector (Promega). The 3.6-kilobase pair pPCP was linearized by PstI, and dC tails were added to the 3′ ends with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, 1 mM CoCl2, and 1 mM dCTP at 37°C for 45 min. The plasmid pGEMTerm (obtained from Dr. Caroline Kane, University of California, Berkeley) contains a TaqI fragment of human histone H3.3 gene (17.Reines D. Wells D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) subcloned in the AccI site of the pGEM-2 vector. pGEMTerm was linearized with SmaI, dC-tailed at 37°C for 2 h, and then digested by PstI and EcoRI. Immobilized dC-3025 template was prepared as described(18.Chafin D.R. Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19114-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A pulse-chase protocol was applied to study the elongation of RNA polymerase II from dC-pPCP. A 30-μl pulse reaction contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 600 uM GTP, UTP, and ATP, 30 uM CTP, 1.5 uM [α-32P]CTP, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml dC-pPCP, KCl, or (NH4)2SO4, and RNA polymerase II. RNA polymerase II was first preincubated with dC-pPCP for 5 min in chase buffer minus UTP. UTP was then added to allow elongation and incorporation of labeled CTP for 1 or 3 min as specified. Following the pulse period, 10 μl of chase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 600 uM GTP, UTP, and ATP, and 4.8 mM CTP) was added to raise the cold CTP concentration. The chase reaction was continued for the indicated time and stopped by removing aliquots into 100 μl of ice-cold sarkosyl solution (1% sarkosyl, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, and 250 μg/ml tRNA). The solution was phenol extracted, and RNAs were ethanol precipitated. A pulse-chase protocol was also applied to study the ability of RNA polymerase II to read through elongation blocks from dC-pGEMTerm. A 30-μl pulse reaction contained 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, 600 uM GTP, UTP, and ATP, 1.0 uM [α-32P]CTP, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml dC-pGEMTerm, 100 mM KCl, and 180 units of RNA polymerase II. RNA polymerase II was first preincubated in this mixture minus UTP and CTP for 5 min. [α-32P]CTP and UTP were then added together, and labeling was allowed to proceed for 2 min. Finally, 10 μl of chase buffer (as described above for the elongation assay) was added. The chase reactions were continued in the presence of indicated reagents and stopped at the indicated times, and RNAs were recovered as described above. Two kinds of elongation complexes were employed. Elongation complexes formed on dC-pGEMTerm were isolated by Bio-Spin 30 columns. The columns were equilibrated by overlaying each column with 200 μl of 1 × reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT, and 5 mM MgCl2) and spinning for 2 min in an International Equipment Corp. tabletop/clinical centrifuge with a swinging bucket rotor at a setting of 4 (approximately 1000 × g). This procedure was repeated four times. Reactions were set up as described for the read-through assay. After 10 min of chase, the reaction mixtures were directly applied to the equilibrated columns and centrifuged for 4 min at a setting of 4. This was repeated with a second column. Reactions containing immobilized dC-3025 were carried out in the following manner. In order to generate comparable amounts of the 13-mers before the elongation complexes were isolated, different unit amounts of P2, S1, and C4 enzymes were used. In a typical 15-μl preincubation, 178 units of P2, 238 units of S1, and 400 units of C4 RNA polymerase II were incubated with 70 μg of dC-3025 beads (200 ng of DNA) for 10 min. in the presence of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Transcripts were pulse labeled by adding 35 μl of a labeling mix containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM GTP and ATP, 75 mM NH4Cl, and 100 μCi of [α-32P]CTP for 30 s. Elongation complexes were concentrated and washed 3 times with 200 μl of HMK buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Transcripts were chased further by resuspending the beads in 50 μl of a nonlabeling transcription mix containing 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, and 0.6 mM NTPs for 8 min. Final elongation complexes were washed and resuspended in HMK buffer. Isolated elongation complexes were then incubated in the presence of indicated reagents. Reactions were stopped at indicated times, and RNAs were recovered as described above. RNAs were resuspended in 6 μl of RNA loading buffer: 0.25 × TBE (89 mM Tris base, 89 mM boric acid, and 0.2 mM EDTA), 8.75 M urea, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol, heated for 5 min at 75°C and analyzed by electrophoresis in 5% (30:1 acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide) or 18 (60:1 acrylamide/Bis-acrylamide) polyacrylamide/6 M urea/1 × TBE gels. Quantitation of radioactivity in polyacrylamide gels was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system, except that a Bio-Rad GS-670 densitometer was used to quantitate the results in Fig. 7. To compare the elongation rates of mutant enzymes with wild type enzyme, we used a dC-tailed template that allows the study of elongation in the absence of a physiological promoter and initiation factors(19.Kadesh T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The size distribution of radioactively labeled transcripts produced during a specific time period gives a measure of the elongation rate. Fig. 1A shows the RNA profiles for P2 and S1 enzymes when elongation assays were carried out with 100 mM KCl, Fig. 1B shows the RNA profiles when elongation assays were carried out with 50 mM KCl plus 80 mM (NH4)2SO4, and Fig. 1C plots the maximum lengths of RNA produced by P2 or S1 at each time point under the two different salt conditions. We found that the S1 mutant enzyme was 2-fold faster in elongation than the P2 wild type enzyme when no NH4+ was present. Under the same assay conditions, however, the C4 mutant enzyme was 50% slower in elongation (data not shown). In the presence of NH4+, the elongation rate of P2 was increased by about 2-fold, but the elongation rate of S1 was almost not changed. On the other hand, the elongation rate of C4 was also increased by about 2-fold in the presence of NH4+ (data not shown), although it remained 50% slower than P2(9.Coulter D.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13190-13198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During in vitro transcription from various dC-tailed templates, RNA polymerase II pauses or is blocked at numerous sites along the template, as revealed by discrete bands in the RNA profile. Reines et al.(17.Reines D. Wells D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) characterized three sequence specific sites (TIa, TIb, and TII) in the first intron of the human histone H3.3 gene that efficiently block elongation by mammalian RNA polymerase II. Later, Christie et al.(20.Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that these three sites also block the elongation of purified yeast RNA polymerase II. Because C4 and S1 mutant enzymes showed abnormal elongation rates when transcribing a dC-tailed template (Fig. 1), we used dC-pGEMTerm, which contains TIa, TIb, and TII, to investigate if the two mutations would affect RNA polymerase II in recognizing and reading through the characterized intrinsic elongation blocks. We found that both wild type and mutant Drosophila RNA polymerases II could be blocked at TIa, TIb, and TII in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2A, after a 5-min chase, besides the run-off transcripts (RO), transcripts with 3′ ends at TII, TIb, and TIa also accumulated for both wild type and mutant enzymes. However, in the absence of any elongation factors the mutant and wild type polymerases displayed differences in the relative amounts of enzyme reaching the end of the template (RO) versus the amount held up at the intrinsic elongation blockage sites (principally TIa and TIb). Thus, the ratios of RO/(RO + TIa) and (RO + TIa)/(RO + TIa + TIb) were different for wild type and mutant enzymes. As compared in Fig. 2B, after 5 min of chase, the ratios of RO/(RO + TIa) were 34, 11, and 54% for P2, C4, and S1, respectively; after 60 min of chase, the ratios increased to 58, 49, and 62%, respectively. After 5 min of chase, the ratios of (RO + TIa)/(RO + TIa + TIb) were 64, 53, and 71% for P2, C4, and S1, respectively; after 60 min of chase, the ratios increased to 82, 78, and 82%, respectively. In these experiments, the ratios of RO/(RO + TIa) and (RO + TIa)/(RO + TIa + TIb) reflect the half-life of pausing at TIa and TIb, respectively, but they are also influenced by the timing of the arrival of polymerases from other earlier pause sites and by the number of polymerases that become arrested (unable to proceed) at TIa and TIb. The different ratios clearly indicate a functional difference between the polymerases. Compared with P2 wild type, the C4 mutant enzyme reads less efficiently through TIa and TIb, whereas the S1 mutant enzyme reads more efficiently through the same blocks. Mammalian TFIIS or the yeast TFIIS analog, P37, has been shown to stimulate mammalian or yeast RNA polymerase II to read through TIa, TIb, and TII(20.Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because C4 and S1 mutants were different from wild type in reading through TIa and TIb when no elongation factors were present, we further investigated how they would respond to DmS-II. We found that DmS-II was able to promote Drosophila RNA polymerase II to read through intrinsic elongation blocks, but although P2 and C4 were stimulated by DmS-II to a similar degree, S1 was much less responsive to the action of DmS-II. A time course of elongation is shown in Fig. 3A and the quantitation is shown in Fig. 3B. After 5 min of chase in the presence of 2.2 nM DmS-II (note that before DmS-II was added there was a 5-min initial chase in the absence of DmS-II), the ratio of RO/(RO + TIa) for P2 was 79%, increasing from 45% after 10 min of chase in the absence of DmS-II (Fig. 2A, 10-min point); this represents a 1.8-fold stimulation. Within the period of 60 min, the presence of DmS-II resulted in an average of 1.7-fold increase in read-through of TIa by P2 (n-min points in Fig. 3versus n + 5-min points in Fig. 2). Similarly, DmS-II resulted in an average of 1.7-fold increase in read-through of TIa by C4, although compared with P2, the C4 mutant remained less efficient at reading through TIa. In contrast, the same amount of DmS-II only resulted in an average of 1.2-fold increase in read-through of TIa by S1 mutant enzyme (compare Fig. 3 and Fig. 2). The experiment shown in Fig. 4 also examines the effect of DmS-II by comparing the RNA profile generated in its absence or presence. For P2 wild type, although the maximum elongation rate (determined from the leading edge of the transcript distribution at each time point) was not stimulated very much, the quantity of pulse-labeled transcripts was greater in the presence of DmS-II, indicating that DmS-II increased the number of P2 polymerase molecules that passed through early pause sites (compare lanes 5, 6, 7, and 8 with lanes 1, 2, 3, and 4). Although there was generally much more labeled RNA after an 8-min chase in the presence of DmS-II than in the absence of DmS-II, an RNA of about 140 nucleotides (Fig. 4, indicated by the arrow) diminished when DmS-II was present (compare lane 8 with lane 4), indicating pausing of P2 at this specific site was reduced by DmS-II. However, for the S1 mutant, there was not much increase in the amount of labeled RNA when DmS-II was present (compare lanes 13, 14, 15, and 16 with lanes 9, 10, 11, and 12), and there was not much decrease in the 140-nucleotide RNA (compare lane 16 with lane 12), confirming that S1 was less responsive to the action of DmS-II. Mammalian or yeast TFIIS has been shown to stimulate nascent transcript cleavage in elongation complexes stalled at the TIa site(20.Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Reines D. Ghanouni P. Li Q. Mote Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15516-15522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cleavage precedes and is necessary for efficient read-through. In order to determine how the two mutations would affect RNA polymerase II in DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage, we initiated transcription from dC-pGEMTerm and isolated elongation complexes stalled at TIa, TIb, or TII using gel filtration spin columns. As shown in Fig. 5, for both wild type and mutant polymerases, when isolated elongation complexes were incubated with DmS-II, transcript shortening was observed and the patterns of cleaved transcripts were similar. When NTPs were added back to the elongation complexes that had been incubated with DmS-II for 60 min and had undergone extensive transcript cleavage, elongation of the shortened transcripts back to the TIa, TIb, or TII site was also observed (lanes 6, 12, and 18). These results indicate that the ternary elongation complex formed with either C4 or S1 mutant RNA polymerase II is still able to carry out DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage and suggest that the shortened transcripts remain stably associated with the complex. Quantitation of the remaining transcripts with 3′ ends at TIa revealed that after 10 min, 90% of the TIa transcripts in the P2 or C4 containing elongation complexes were cleaved, whereas only 57% were cleaved in the S1 containing complexes, consistent with S1 being different in interacting with DmS-II. In order to look in more detail at DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage and compare it with pyrophosphorolysis, we isolated elongation complexes stalled at a major elongation block after the incorporation of 13 nucleotides with immobilized dC-3025 template. When isolated elongation complexes were incubated with 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate or 1 nM DmS-II, transcript shortening from the 13-mer was observed for all three polymerases (Fig. 6). The pattern of the transcripts shortened by DmS-II mediated cleavage was similar to that shortened by pyrophosphorolysis, with the 13-mer decreasing and transcripts of 11, 9, 7, and 5 nucleotides appearing(14.Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18762-18770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of run-off transcripts found with the three polymerases (compare lanes 1, 6, and 11 in Fig. 6A and lanes 1, 7, and 13 in Fig. 6B) indicates that S1 passes the pause site after incorporation of 13 nucleotides more easily than wild type, whereas C4 has more difficulty, consistent with findings obtained with the dC-pGEMTerm template. In the presence of 1 mM pyrophosphate (Fig. 6A), 70-75% of the 13-mers in the P2 or S1 complexes were shortened after 90 min of pyrophosphorolysis, whereas 90% were shortened in the C4 complexes. In reaching the final pattern of 9-mer, 7-mer, or 5-mer, S1 was fastest, and C4 was slowest (compare lanes 4, 9, and 14 and compare lanes 5, 10, and 15). In the presence of 1 nM DmS-II (Fig. 6B), 90% of the 13-mers were shortened in the P2 or C4 complexes in 10 min, whereas 55% were shortened in the S1 complexes. In reaching the 9-mer, 7-mer, or 5-mer, S1 was similar to P2, but C4 was significantly slower (compare lanes 4, 10, and 16). These results confirm that relative to wild type and C4, S1 is different in its interaction with DmS-II. The results also suggest that C4 is altered in its ability to move backward along the template. We have examined the properties of two Drosophila RNA polymerase II mutants in elongation, recognition of intrinsic elongation blocks, read-through in response to DmS-II, transcript cleavage in response to DmS-II, and pyrophosphorolysis. Our results show that the two mutations affect distinct functions associated with the two large subunits of RNA polymerase II. The C4 mutation in the largest subunit probably affects the translocation of the polymerase such that the forward and backward movement of the mutant elongation complex is slowed down. The S1 mutation in the second largest subunit probably affects the conformation of the polymerase and increases the time spent by the polymerase in the elongation competent mode such that the mutant enzyme is less responsive to the action of DmS-II and NH4+. It has been shown previously that the C4 mutant polymerase is resistant to α-amanitin in RNA polymerization due to decreased binding affinity to the toxin(8.Coulter D.E. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1945-1952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that in the presence of 1 μg/ml of α-amanitin, the DmS-II-stimulated cleavage of nascent transcripts by wild type polymerase was not observed within 60 min, confirming the inhibitory effect of α-amanitin on this process(14.Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18762-18770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 25.Wang D. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cleavage by C4 mutant was still observed (data not shown), consistent with C4 not binding α-amanitin normally. Although the detailed inhibitory mechanism of α-amanitin is yet to be elucidated, recent studies suggest that α-amanitin inhibits pyrophosphorolysis and DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage differently. For example, the toxin allows (slowed) pyrophosphorolysis within a paused elongation complex but completely blocks DmS-II action(26.Chafin D.R. Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19114-19119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because the response of C4 to DmS-II and NH4+ parallels that of the wild type, the structural features involved in interacting with DmS-II and NH4+ are probably not affected by the C4 mutation. Furthermore, because C4 carries out initial DmS-II-mediated transcript cleavage and pyrophosphorolysis as well as the wild type enzyme, the catalytic steps during these two processes may not be affected, either. It is possible that although the C4 mutation reduces the affinity of the enzyme for α-amanitin, it also introduces certain functional changes similar to those that would be caused by α-amanitin binding. One possibility is that the forward and backward translocation is slowed. This possibility is consistent with our observations that C4 is slower in reading through elongation blocks and is also slower in extended transcript shortening. Three regions of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II have been implicated previously in binding of TFIIS. Sawadogo et al.(27.Sawadogo M. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 12-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) analyzed the interaction of yeast TFIIS with RNAPII0, RNAPIIA, and RNAPIIB, enzyme whose C-terminal repeated domain (CTD) is phosphorylated, not phosphorylated, or proteolyzed, respectively. With glycerol gradients and electrophoresis under native conditions, they found that TFIIS binds preferentially to II0 and IIA, suggesting the CTD is involved in binding TFIIS. However, TFIIS can stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II in which the entire CTD has been proteolyzed during purification. Furthermore, Christie et al.(20.Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that for Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II the CTD and subunits four and seven, which are essential in vivo, are not required in vitro for read-through of intrinsic elongation blocks and nascent transcript cleavage in response to TFIIS. Rappaport et al.(28.Rappaport J. Cho K. Saltzman A. Prenger J. Golomb M. Weinmann R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed that a fusion protein containing a portion of the largest subunit of human RNA polymerase II is able to inhibit the stimulatory effect of TFIIS. A monoclonal antibody against this fusion protein can also inhibit the stimulation by TFIIS. However, TFIIS binds only weakly to the fusion protein they used, suggesting the protein domain around conserved region B in the largest subunit may be only part of the TFIIS-binding site. Archambault et al.(29.Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) isolated seven mutations in the gene encoding the largest subunit of S. cerevisiae RNA polymerase II (rpo21) that confer increased growth inhibition by the uracil analog, 6-azauracil, which is also a mutant phenotype associated with yeast mutants lacking TFIIS. The 6-azauracil-sensitive phenotype of RNA polymerase II mutants can be suppressed by overexpression of TFIIS, suggesting that the region identified by the 6-azauracil-sensitive rpo21 mutations, which is located between conserved regions G and H, may be involved in interacting with TFIIS. Our results with S1 mutant enzyme demonstrate the involvement of the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II in responding to the action of DmS-II. One simple explanation for the S1 mutant biochemical phenotypes would be that the S1 mutation, which results in changing Ser-728 to Cys, directly affects the binding of DmS-II. However, the observations that S1 mutant enzyme has a higher elongation rate and is more efficient at reading through elongation blocks in the absence of DmS-II suggest that if DmS-II binding is affected, it is not the only property altered. The stimulatory effect of NH4+ on transcription has been reported in several studies(10.Chen, Y. 1995 Structural and Functional Studies of Drosophila RNA Polymerase II Mutants. Ph.D. thesis, Duke UniversityGoogle Scholar, 30.Sluder A.E. Price D.H. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was speculated that NH4+ stimulates transcription through an effect on the conformation of the polymerase. The observation that NH4+ has a much weaker effect on S1 mutant enzyme suggests that the polymerase conformation is probably altered by the S1 mutation. Price et al.(12.Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) proposed that during the elongation cycle the polymerase can be in a paused conformation or an elongation-competent conformation, and the conversion from a paused to an elongation-competent conformation can be promoted by the action of an elongation factor, such as Drosophila Factor 5 (TFIIF). From a TFIIS mutant that was able to stimulate cleavage but that failed to promote read-through, Cipres-Palacin and Kane (31.Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8087-8091Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) suggested that conformational changes in the polymerase, in addition to transcript cleavage, are probably necessary for efficient read-through. It is possible that conformational changes can be induced by different mechanisms depending on the interacting factors and that several steps are involved, some of which may be common for different pathways. The S1 mutation may slow one of the intermediate steps, so that even though the ternary complex can physically interact with DmS-II (or NH4+) and carry out transcript cleavage, the final conformational change can not be reached normally. At the same time, the S1 mutation may alter the basal conformation of the polymerase in a way that it is already more competent for elongation in the absence of elongation factors. Comparative physical studies of elongation complexes containing wild type or mutant polymerase should provide additional insights into conformation changes involved in transcript elongation and may reveal how the regions of the subunits affected by the C4 and S1 mutations are involved in these processes."

Previously, the C-terminal region of CPE has been shown to participate in the binding of the protein to membranes and to also contribute to the sorting of CPE into the regulated pathway. In this study, the role of the C-terminal region of CPE was further examined using several approaches. A series of CPE mutants with C-terminal deletions was expressed in the baculovirus system; constructs with a deletion of 14 or 23 residues were expressed at levels comparable to wild-type CPE. In contrast, deletion of 33 or more residues eliminated CPE activity, and the resulting protein was not secreted from the cells. Even though CPE mutants with a deletion of 14 or 23 residues were expressed normally, the resulting protein was mainly soluble, whereas approximately 55% of wild-type CPE was membrane associated. When expressed in AtT-20 cells, CPE with a deletion of 43 C-terminal amino acids was not secreted, whereas CPE with a deletion of 23 residues was secreted via the regulated pathway. Pulse-chase analysis revealed the protein with a deletion of 43 residues to be degraded in a non-acidic intracellular compartment. To investigate whether the C-terminal region of CPE can confer membrane binding and regulated pathway sorting to another protein, portions of the CPE C-terminal region were attached to the C terminus of albumin and the fusion proteins expressed in AtT-20 cells. Of the constructs examined, only the protein containing 51 amino acids of CPE was sorted to the regulated pathway, although with reduced efficiency compared to endogenous CPE. Although the C-terminal 14 amino acids of CPE are sufficient to target albumin to membranes, this fusion protein is not sorted into the regulated pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that the C-terminal 14 amino acids of CPE are important for membrane binding and that membrane binding and sorting require distinct signals.

Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) ( 1The abbreviations used are: CPEcarboxypeptidase EHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salinedansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl.)(EC 3.4.17.10), which is also known as carboxypeptidase H and enkephalin convertase, functions in the production of a large number of bioactive peptides(1.Fricker L.D.

Further evidence of the physiological role of CPE comes from the recent finding that a mouse strain with an inactive form of CPE (due to a point mutation) does not efficiently convert proinsulin into insulin(9.Naggert J.K.

However, the amino acid sequence (deduced from the DNA sequence) does not show any potential transmembrane-spanning helical regions, suggesting that CPE is membrane-bound through another mechanism(11.Fricker L.D.

Also, the binding of CPE to membranes is pH-dependent, with maximal binding occurring at pH 5-6 and minimal binding at pH values greater than 8 (13.Fricker L.D. J. Cell.

Although CPE has also been found to aggregate at acidic pH values, this process appears to be distinct from the membrane-binding process(15.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the C-terminal region of CPE contributes to the membrane binding of this protein. First, the C-terminal region of CPE is predicted to form an amphiphilic α-helix(14.Fricker L.D. Das B. Angeletti R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, synthetic peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of CPE are able to bind to membranes in a pH-dependent manner(14.Fricker L.D. Das B. Angeletti R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the only difference found between the soluble and membrane-bound forms of CPE is within the C-terminal region; antisera directed against the C-terminal region of CPE show much stronger binding to the membrane forms of CPE compared to the soluble forms(14.Fricker L.D. Das B. Angeletti R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Guest P.C. Ravazzola M. Davidson H.W. Orci L. Hutton J.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, this point is controversial as it has been reported that the soluble and membrane forms of CPE show comparable binding of C-terminally directed antisera(17.Parkinson D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 86: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, one focus of the present study was to further examine the role of the C-terminal region of CPE in membrane binding. The pH-dependent membrane binding of CPE has been proposed to be a mechanism for the sorting of CPE(14.Fricker L.D. Das B. Angeletti R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, the interaction of CPE with membranes in the trans Golgi network, with an internal pH in the 6-6.5 range, would help drive the sorting of CPE into the regulated pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis was our recent finding that fusion proteins containing 51 amino acids of the C-terminal region of CPE attached to albumin are both membrane bound and partially sorted into the regulated pathway (18.Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another focus of the present study was to investigate whether the sorting and membrane-binding regions within the C-terminal region of CPE were the same or distinct. Several approaches were used to study the C-terminal region of CPE. The first approach used deletion mutations within the C-terminal region to address the role of this domain in protein expression and membrane binding. In the second approach, fusion proteins consisting of albumin with small portions of CPE attached to the C terminus were expressed in AtT-20 cells and examined for sorting and membrane binding. The results of these analyses indicate that the membrane-binding and sorting domains within the C-terminal region are distinct. Our results support the hypothesis that the putative amphiphilic helical region of CPE contributes to the membrane binding but does not support the hypothesis that this region is also involved with intracellular routing of CPE. CPE C-terminal deletions were generated using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). Rat CPE cDNA was subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the vector pALTER-1, and mutagenic oligonucleotides with stop codons in different positions were used to generate C-terminally truncated forms of CPE. The hemagglutinin (HA) sequence recognized by the monoclonal antisera 12CA5 (HA tag, Fig. 1) was inserted into the N-terminal PstI site of wild-type CPE by ligation of the appropriate oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides introduce an XbaI site on the N-terminal side of the HA sequence. The Δpro CPE construct (Fig. 1) was created using polymerase chain reaction to introduce an XbaI site at the junction between the pre-domain and the pro-domain and then to ligate this small fragment encoding the pre-region into the expression vector, replacing the prepro-region of wild-type CPE. The construct with the N-terminal HA tag and the deletion of the 23 C-terminal residues was created by piecing together the cDNA encoding the N-terminal fragment (BamHI/SacI) of HA-tagged wild-type CPE and the cDNA encoding the C-terminal fragment (SacI/EcoRI) of CPEΔ23. The constructs were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (PharMingen) to express it under polyhedrin promoter control in the baculovirus system. For expression in a mammalian cell line, constructs were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen). Human albumin cDNA in pGEM7zf (Promega) was used to generate albumin/CPE fusion proteins. Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate fragments of CPE encoding the various C-terminal regions, with a Bsu36I site on the 5′-end and a SacI site on the 3′-end. These fragments were subcloned into the appropriate sites within the albumin/pGEM plasmid; there is a Bsu36I site at the C terminus of albumin and a SacI site in the pGEM7zf vector. For the expression in AtT-20 cells, the constructs were subcloned into the BamHI and NsiI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA/NEO (Invitrogen). Dideoxynucleotide sequencing was performed to confirm the sequence of the C-terminal regions of all constructs and the N-terminal region of the Δpro and HA-tagged constructs. The expression plasmids containing the sequences encoding albumin/CPE fusion proteins, CPEΔ43, and HA-tagged wild-type and CPEΔ23 were transfected into AtT-20 cells using the standard calcium phosphate procedure(19.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Stable cell lines were selected using 0.6 mg/ml geneticin (G418). For the albumin/CPE fusion proteins and the CPEΔ43 constructs, 80-100 colonies were isolated per construct and grown in 35-mm plates. Cells expressing the various constructs were identified by immunoprecipitation (for the albumin/CPE constructs) or by Western blot analysis (for CPEΔ43), as described(18.Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For each of these constructs, several positive clones were selected and analyzed as described below; the data shown are representative of two to five separate clones. HA-tagged wild-type and CPEΔ23 were similarly transfected into the AtT-20 cells, but individual cell lines were not isolated. Instead, G418 was used to select for stably transformed cells, and after 3 weeks in culture, the mixed population of cells was analyzed for regulated secretion as described below. Recombinant baculovirus expressing the various constructs was generated using the Baculogold system (PharMingen), using the procedure recommended by the supplier. Sf9 cells (25 ml at 1.6 × 106/ml) in a 250-ml flask were infected with the recombinant baculovirus, and cells were incubated for 72 h at 27°C. Cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The cells were homogenized (Polytron, Brinkman) in 12.5 ml of 100 mM NaAc buffer, pH 5.5. Aliquots of cell homogenate and media were assayed for carboxypeptidase activity using 0.1 mM dansyl-Phe-Ala-Arg in 100 mM NaAc buffer, pH 5.5 (without CoCl2), in a final volume of 250 μl as described(20.Fricker L.D. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 23: 237-250Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the Bradford reagent. Aliquots were also analyzed on a Western blot as described below. To determine the amount of CPE that was membrane-associated, the cell homogenates were centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was homogenized (Polytron) in 0.1 M NaAc buffer, pH 5.5, and centrifuged as above. Then, the pellet was homogenized (Polytron) in 1 M NaCl in NaAc buffer and centrifuged as above. This step was repeated, and then the pellet was homogenized in 1% Triton X-100 and 1 M NaCl in NaAc buffer and centrifuged as above. This step was repeated, and the final pellet was resuspended in 0.1 M NaAc buffer. Aliquots of each fraction were assayed for CPE activity as described above. In a separate series of experiments, cells were extracted directly with 1% Triton X-100 and 1 M NaCl in 0.1 M NaAc buffer, pH 5.5, and the extract was applied to a p-aminobenzoyl Arg-Sepharose 6B affinity column as described(14.Fricker L.D. Das B. Angeletti R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the various CPE constructs to bind to the column was assessed by Western blot analysis. AtT-20 cells expressing the various fusion proteins were grown as described previously for wild-type AtT-20 cells(21.Klein R.S. Das B. Fricker L.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells from four 15-cm plates were scraped into 5 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then pelleted at low speed. The pellet was gently resuspended in 3 ml of cold 0.25 M sucrose in 10 mM Tris, 1 mM MgAc2, pH 7.4, and passed through a cold steel ball-bearing homogenizer several times(22.Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The homogenate was diluted with 2.3 M sucrose in the same buffer to give a final concentration of 1.4 M sucrose. A step sucrose gradient was created using the following solutions: 5 ml of 2 M sucrose, 8 ml of 1.4 M sucrose containing the cell lysate, 18 ml of 1.2 M sucrose, and 6 ml of 0.8 M sucrose. The tubes were centrifuged in a SW-28 rotor for 12 h at 26,000 rpm at 4°C. Fractions (2-3 ml) were collected and diluted 10 times with 0.2 M sucrose and centrifuged using the Ti-42 rotor at 32,000 rpm for 6 h at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended and sonicated in 1 ml of 10 mM NaAc buffer, pH 5.5, and stored frozen at −20°C. CPE activity was determined as described(23.Fricker L.D. Neuroprotocols. 1994; 5: 151-156Google Scholar). Acid phosphatase, a lysosomal marker, and α-mannosidase II, a Golgi marker, were assayed as described(24.Fricker L.D. Reaves B.J. Das B. Dannies P.S. Neuroendocrinology. 1990; 51: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25.Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the Bradford assay. Western blot analysis was performed to identify fractions with CPE and albumin immunoreactivity. The fraction collected from the interface of the 0.8 and 1.2 M sucrose layers, which is enriched in Golgi and secretory vesicles (22.Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and contains a large amount of immunoreactive CPE and albumin (not shown), was used for further studies on the soluble/membrane distribution of the proteins. A 100-μl aliquot of the resuspended Golgi/vesicle fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were removed (“soluble” fraction), and the pellets were resuspended and sonicated in 100 μl of 1 M sodium chloride in 10 mM NaAc buffer following centrifugation again at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The second supernatants (“membrane-1” extracts) were removed, the pellets were sonicated in 100 μl of 1 M sodium chloride and 1% Triton X-100 in the same buffer and centrifuged again, and the supernatants were removed (“membrane-2” extracts). Aliquots of each of the three supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting as described below. Protein samples were combined with SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer, heated to 95°C for 5 min, cooled, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The CPE was detected using the standard enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham). The antiserum raised against an N-terminal peptide of bovine CPE has been previously described(14.Fricker L.D. Das B. Angeletti R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another antiserum was raised against the peptide SETLNF, which corresponds to the predicted C-terminal sequence of CPE, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the glutaraldehyde procedure, as described(26.Parkinson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17101-17105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was produced against this peptide (Hazleton Research Products, Denver, PA). This antiserum was additionally purified on an affinity column consisting of the same peptide conjugated to Sepharose 6B using the epichlorohydrin method(27.Porath J. Axen R. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 44: 19-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified antiserum was used at a dilution corresponding to 1:1000 of initial antiserum. An antiserum against human serum albumin (Cappel) was used at a dilution of 1:1000. The monoclonal antisera 12CA5, which recognizes the HA epitope, was a gift of Dr. John Backer (Albert Einstein College of Medicine) and was used at a dilution of 1:5000. To examine whether the albumin/CPE fusion proteins are secreted via the regulated pathway, the cells expressing these proteins were grown on 15-cm cell culture dishes to 90% confluency. The cells were washed twice with PBS, then treated with secretagogue (5 μM forskolin) or control media for 30 min, and the secreted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. AtT-20 cells expressing the HA-tagged wild type and CPEΔ23 were similarly treated, except that the cells were treated with control media, media containing 10 μM forskolin, or media containing 0.1 μg/ml tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Wild-type AtT-20 cells and AtT-20 cells expressing CPEΔ43 were labeled (pulse) with [35S]Met (100 μCi/ml) for 30 min, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 0, 30, or 180 min. Media were removed, and cells were washed with PBS and then frozen in 10 mM NaAc, pH 5.5, with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells and the media were then subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously(18.Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of different conditions and agents on the secretion of CPE, AtT-20 cells were labeled as described above and then during the 3-h chase subjected to different treatments including incubation at 15 and 20°C, brefeldin A (5 μg/ml), chloroquine (100 μM), and NH4Cl (10 mM). Media were collected, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and frozen in 10 mM NaAc, pH 5.5. Both cells and media were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the antisera raised against the N-terminal region of CPE as described(18.Mitra A. Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19876-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the portion of the C-terminal region of CPE that is involved with membrane binding and to test if this region is also involved with intracellular routing, a series of deletion mutants was created (Fig. 1). Using the baculovirus expression system, all of the constructs were expressed in the Sf9 insect cell line in comparable levels (Fig. 2, left). However, the two constructs with the largest C-terminal deletions (Δ33 and Δ43) were not secreted from the Sf9 cells (Fig. 2, right). These two constructs also did not appear to be enzymatically active; the levels of CPE-like activity in either cells or media after infection with Δ33- and Δ43-expressing baculovirus were not substantially different from control virus-infected cells (Fig. 2, bottom). The other two C-terminal deletions (Δ14 and Δ23) as well as a construct with the N-terminal pro-region deleted (Δpro) showed enzyme activities comparable to that of wild-type CPE (Fig. 2, bottom). The ability of the various constructs to bind to a Sepharose benzoyl-Arg substrate affinity column correlated with the presence of enzyme activity; all of the constructs except CPEΔ33 and Δ43 bound to this column (data not shown). To examine whether the various deletions altered the soluble/membrane distribution of the active forms of CPE, cells expressing the constructs that showed enzyme activity were sequentially extracted with NaAc at pH 6.0 (soluble), with 1 M NaCl in NaAc buffer (membrane-1), and then with a combination of 1% Triton X-100 and 1 M NaCl in NaAc buffer (membrane-2). To ensure that each extraction was complete, two extractions with each buffer were performed and assayed separately. Typically, the second extraction with each buffer contained much less CPE activity than the first extraction (Fig. 3), indicating that the apparent membrane binding is not due to incomplete tissue disruption or to revesiculation. Approximately 40-50% of the total wild-type CPE and ΔproCPE activity was detected in the two soluble extracts, 30-40% was detected in the membrane-1 extracts, and 15-20% was detected in the membrane-2 extracts (Fig. 3). Membranes after the extractions contained very little CPE activity (not shown). In contrast to the results with wild-type CPE and ΔproCPE, the two C-terminal deletion mutants (CPEΔ14 and Δ23) were much more abundant in the soluble fraction and virtually absent from the membrane-2 fraction (Fig. 3). This finding supports the hypothesis that the C-terminal region, which is predicted to form an amphiphilic helix, is important for the NaCl/Triton X-100-dependent binding of CPE to membranes. Removal of the C-terminal 14 amino acids has a minor effect on the net charge, with the elimination of two acidic groups and one basic group (Fig. 1). In contrast, removal of the C-terminal 23 residues has a larger effect on the net charge. To test whether the decrease in membrane binding of CPEΔ23 is due to an alteration in the net charge, which affects the ability of the protein to aggregate, we examined the pH-dependent aggregation of wild-type CPE and CPEΔ23. CPE was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and tested for aggregation as described previously(15.Song L. Fricker L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7963-7967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Wild-type CPE and CPEΔ23 showed substantial aggregation at pH 5.0, less aggregation at pH 5.5, and virtually no aggregation at pH 6.0 or higher (data not shown). The similar pH-dependent aggregation of the two forms of CPE implies that this aggregation is not responsible for the membrane-binding properties of CPE, which show substantial differences between wild-type CPE and CPEΔ23 (Fig. 3). To test whether the C-terminal 23 residues of CPE contributes to the efficient sorting of this protein into the regulated pathway, the HA-epitope tag sequence was introduced in the N-terminal region (to distinguish the mutant CPE from endogenous CPE) and the protein expressed in AtT-20 cells. The N-terminal HA sequence does not interfere with the enzymatic properties of CPE or the sorting of this protein into the regulated pathway (data not shown). AtT-20 cells expressing HA-tagged CPEΔ23 were stimulated with secretagogues for 30 min, and the amount or protein in the media was analyzed by Western blot analysis. The monoclonal antisera that recognizes the HA sequence binds to a single protein in the media of transfected AtT-20 cells (Fig. 4); untransfected cells do not show any signal with this antisera (data not shown). Treatment of the cells with either forskolin or tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulates the levels of HA-tagged CPEΔ23 in the media approximately 2-3-fold (Fig. 4). The same media samples were also analyzed for endogenous CPE, which was detected using an antisera directed against the C-terminal region (i.e. the region missing from the CPEΔ23 construct). The endogenous CPE that reacts with the C-terminally directed antisera is stimulated by the two secretagogues to the same extent as the CPEΔ23 (Fig. 4), indicating that the C-terminal region is not necessary for the efficient sorting of CPE into the regulated pathway. CPE with a deletion of 43 C-terminal amino acids was expressed in AtT-20 cells to examine whether the C-terminal region is required for secretion in a mammalian cell line that normally expresses CPE. Immunoprecipitation of the [35S]Met-labeled extract from cells expressing CPEΔ43 showed a major band of approximately 44 kDa and a minor band of 50 kDa, in addition to the endogenous proCPE (56 kDa) and various minor bands that were also detected with wild-type AtT-20 cells (Fig. 5). Analysis of 5 separate clones by [35S]Met labeling and immunoprecipitation and 30 separate clones by Western blot analysis showed a similar presence of two additional proteins of approximately 44 and 50 kDa. Both forms of CPEΔ43 do not change during the 30-min chase but then largely disappear from the cells after 180 min of chase (Fig. 5). Neither form of CPEΔ43 appears in the media, indicating that the mutant is degraded during the 180-min chase. In contrast, the endogenous CPE becomes slightly smaller and shows a weaker signal after 30 min of chase. This is consistent with the removal of Met-containing N-terminal (propeptide) and C-terminal sequences from a portion of the molecules; altogether, 4 out of the 9 total Met residues in mouse proCPE are located within 13 residues of the N and C termini (GenBank accession no. X61232). After 180 min of chase, the endogenous CPE is detected in the media in amounts equal to those in the cells (Fig. 5). To further investigate the fate of CPEΔ43 in the AtT-20 cells, the cells were labeled with [35S]Met and then either analyzed directly or chased under a variety of conditions that block various cellular processes. After 3 h of chase, both the endogenous CPE and the two bands of CPEΔ43 were substantially decreased relative to the levels before the chase (Fig. 6). Analysis of the media showed the CPE, but not the CPEΔ43, to be secreted (not shown) as found for Fig. 5. The degradation of CPEΔ43 that occurs during the 3-h chase is blocked when the chase is performed at either 15 or 20°C (Fig. 6). Brefeldin A, which blocks transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, does not block the degradation of CPEΔ43, although this"

In mitochondria, the bis-heme cytochrome b is largely membrane-intercalated and contains a low potential heme bL (EM~−90 mV) near the outside surface of the inner membrane and a high potential heme bH (EM~+40 mV) at the center of the membrane about 20 Å away from heme bL(5.Brandt U.

Cytochrome c1 has an EM,7 = +230 mV(12.Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ISP and cytochrome c1 are largely extramembranous on the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. ISP is bound to the complex by a hydrophobic helix, and cytochrome c1 is anchored to the membrane via a single hydrophobic helix at its COOH terminus(5.Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus complex III can be thought of as being composed of a low potential center (hemes bL and bH) and a high potential center (ISP and cytochrome c1). iron-sulfur protein of complex III electron paramagnetic resonance oxidized and reduced ubiquinone, respectively the high and low potential hemes, respectively, of the bis-heme cytochrome b of complex III cytochrome c1 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (E)-methyl-3-methoxy-2-(4′-trans-stilbenyl)acrylate submitochondrial particles. Early work on the mechanisms of electron transfer and proton translocation by complex III revealed certain peculiar features that generated various hypothetical mechanisms(12.Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, the protonmotive Q-cycle, originally proposed by Mitchell(13.Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 56: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 14.Mitchell P. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 15.Mitchell P. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), has become the generally accepted hypothesis for the mechanisms of electron transfer and proton translocation by complex III. Fig. 1 shows the Q-cycle scheme as presented by Trumpower(3.Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It consists of four principal steps: (i) single electron transfer from QH2 to ISP and then to cytochromes c1 and c; (ii) a second electron transfer from the one-electron oxidized quinol (Q) to bL (oxidation of QH2 at this site (Qo) involves the translocation of 2H+ outward); (iii) electron transfer from bL to bH; (iv) electron transfer from bH to Q. This site of Q reduction is referred to as the Qi site. A second cycle of one-electron Q reduction at the Qi site together with acquisition of 2H+ from the inside reforms QH2. The net result in two cycles is transfer of two electrons from QH2 out to cytochrome c and translocation of 4H+ across the membrane. Two sets of inhibitors are known, which are classified as Qoand Qi site inhibitors(5.Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 16.von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 17.Link T.A. Haase U. Brandt U. von Jagow G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Myxothiazol (and other inhibitors containing a β-methoxyacrylate moiety), stigmatellin, mucidin, and undecylhydroxydioxobenzothiazole are considered inhibitors of QH2 oxidation at the Qo site, and antimycin, diuron, and 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO) are considered inhibitors of Q reduction at the Qi site (5.Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 16.von Jagow G. Link T.A.

Biomembr. 1993; 25: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Q cycle scheme incorporates the peculiar features of complex III, which were considered incompatible with a linear electron transfer pathway. For example (i) all of the inhibitors mentioned above phenomenologically interrupt electron transfer between the low and the high potential centers, resulting in the reduction of the b and the oxidation of the c cytochromes. However, if a Qi site inhibitor (e.g. antimycin) and a Qosite inhibitor (e.g. myxothiazol) are added together, then the reduction of bH and bL by respiratory substrates would also be inhibited(3.Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The Q cycle shows that addition of either a Qi or a Qo site inhibitor leaves an uninhibited path open for b reduction, but when both sites are blocked, the b reduction is inhibited. (ii) A second early observation was that in antimycin and QH2-treated preparations, oxidation of the high potential center by potassium ferricyanide resulted in a transitory extra reduction of cytochrome b(18.Rieske J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 145: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19.Chance B. Ernster L. Estabrook R.W. Slater E.C. Dynamics of Energy-Transducing Membranes. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1974: 553-578Google Scholar). The Q cycle shows that the high potential center must be oxidized in order to accept an electron from QH2 and yield Q, which is the electron donor to bL at the Qo site. (iii) The proton stoichiometry of 4H+/2e determined for complex III is accounted for by the Q cycle, which shows that for every electron transferred from QH2 to the high potential center, two protons are translocated from QH2 to the outside (for other experimental observations in support of the Q cycle, see the excellent recent review by Brandt and Trumpower(5.Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar)). However, we showed in 1982 that in SMP the antimycin block leaks at a rate of 20-40 nmol of substrate (NADH or succinate) oxidized per min/mg of protein and that the post-steady-state oxidation of the b hemes through the leak in the antimycin block is biphasic, with reduced bL undergoing oxidation 10 times faster than reduced bH(20.Hatefi Y. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1982; 24: 6614-6618Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results are difficult to reconcile with the Q cycle, because antimycin appears to inhibit the oxidation of both bL and bH, and the faster oxidation of bL than bH requires that the path of electrons from these hemes through the leak in the antimycin block to be either separate or bH→ bL→ acceptor, with the first step being considerably slower than the second. Neither possibility agrees antimycin with the path being bL→ bH→antimycin Q, as specified by the Q cycle. This paper reports the results of experiments, which shed new light on the mechanism of electron transfer by complex III, as well as on the effects of antimycin, myxothiazol, and other related inhibitors on the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme. Antimycin A, HQNO, and FCCP were obtained from Sigma. Myxothiazol was from Boeringer Mannheim. Stigmatellin, ascorbic acid, and TMPD were from Fluka. ATP was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. MOA-stilbene was a generous gift of Dr. G. von Jagow, Universitatsklinikum, Frankfurt, Germany. The sources of other chemicals were as indicated elsewhere(21.Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol.

SMP were prepared from bovine heart mitochondria in the presence of 1.5 mM ATP during sonication as described previously(22.Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14424-14427Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al.(23.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type yeast strain (D273-10B) and the ubiquinone-deficient strain E3-24 (24.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were generous gifts of Dr. Diana Beattie, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV. Each strain was spread on an agar plate, and the cells were grown from a single colony in a medium containing galactose as carbon source as described in the literature(25.Clejan L. Beattie D.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7984-7991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were prepared in a medium containing 0.6 M sorbitol and 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, after treatment of the cells with zymolyase according to Daum et al.(26.Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SMP were prepared in a medium containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, 120 mM KCl, and 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.5, as reported by Clejan et al.(27.Clejan L. Sidhu A. Beattie D.S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome b was monitored spectrophotometrically at 563 - 575 nm in a buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0. SMP concentration was 1-1.5 mg/ml. Results were essentially the same at 565 - 575 nm. KCN, ascorbic acid (neutralized with NaOH), and TMPD were added at 10 mM, 10 mM, and 0.2 mM, respectively. Inhibitors of complex III were added from an ethanolic solution, and the concentrations used are indicated in the figure legends. Ethanol concentration never exceeded 1%. Absorbance changes and spectra were recorded using an SLM DW2000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer. The data shown were collected and stored in a computer on-line to the spectrophotometer. Assay temperature was 30°C throughout. Ubiquinone was extracted from saponified SMP as described previously(28.Hatefi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine or yeast SMP (10-50 mg) were saponified with 10% ethanolic KOH in the presence of pyrogallol to prevent Q destruction. Then Q was extracted with spectrograde cyclohexane. After washing with water, cyclohexane was removed under vacuum, and the extracted Q dissolved in a small volume of ethanol. The concentration of Q was determined from its oxidized minus KBH4-reduced absorption spectrum at 275 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 12.26 mM− cm−(29.Hatefi Y. Adv. Enzymol. 1963; 25: 275-328PubMed Google Scholar). In our experience, this procedure is more reliable than direct solvent extraction for correct determination of the Q content of particles. The studies reported here were performed on SMP from bovine and yeast mitochondria rather than on purified complex III for the following reasons: (i) to avoid possible complications due to the presence of detergents in purified complex III; (ii) to be able to use respiratory substrates such as NADH and succinate, rather than added quinols, as electron donors to complex III; and (iii) to take advantage of the energy-coupling capability of bovine SMP. However, because the bovine SMP used in these studies were well coupled, it was necessary in certain experiments to add an uncoupler to the reaction mixture in order to release the kinetics of electron transfer from coupling constraints. As controls, experiments were carried out in the absence of uncouplers, using a different type of bovine SMP preparation that is inherently uncoupled. It was thus ascertained that other than releasing respiratory control, the added uncoupler had no effect on the redox reactions studies. It should also be added here that all the complex III inhibitors used (except HQNO, see below) were separately checked to determine the concentration at which they exerted their maximal inhibitory effects. They were then used at slightly or several times higher than their maximal effective concentration (or mol/mol of complex III in SMP) in the experiments reported below. Most inhibitors of complex III are generally divided into two groups, the “Qi site” and the “Qo site” inhibitors, as explained in the Introduction. However, for reasons that will become apparent, the functional connotation of these designations is apt to confuse this report. Therefore, we will simply refer here to the two groups of inhibitors, respectively, as I-side inhibitors (as represented by antimycin) and O-side inhibitors (as represented by myxothiazol), in conformity with the positions of point mutations on the cytochrome b molecule of R. capsulatus and R. sphaeroides that result in resistance to one or another set of inhibitors(4.Gennis R.B. Barquera B. Hacker B. Van Doren S.R. Arnaud S. Crofts A.R. Davidson E. Gray K.A. Daldal F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is well known that an I-side or an O-side inhibitor blocks the oxidation, but not the substrate-induced reduction, of bH and bL. However when the two types of inhibitors are added together, the reduction of these hemes by respiratory substrates is also inhibited(3.Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For the purpose at hand, we have used here antimycin and HQNO as examples of I-side inhibitors and myxothiazol and MOA-stilbene as examples of O-side inhibitors. Antimycin, myxothiazol, and MOA-stilbene exert their maximal inhibitory effects at a concentration comparable with that of cytochrome b or c1 of complex III. The concentration of HQNO required for maximal inhibition is 20-40 μM(20.Hatefi Y. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1982; 24: 6614-6618Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, even at concentrations greater than that required for maximal inhibition, none of these inhibitors caused complete inhibition. Consequently, when an I-side and an O-side inhibitor were added together, bH and bL could still be reduced by succinate or NADH, albeit at a slow rate (Fig. 2). The combination of antimycin and myxothiazol caused the greatest inhibition of b reduction, MOA-stilbene was not as effective as myxothiazol when used together with antimycin, and HQNO at 20-40 μM caused the least inhibition of b reduction when used in combination with either myxothiazol or MOA-stilbene (Fig. 2, traces A-D, respectively). Traces E and F in Fig. 2 show the extent of b reduction by succinate when a single inhibitor (antimycin in E, myxothiazol in F) was added. The heavy bars show the extent of b reduction at 563 - 575 nm after the addition of Na2S2O4. In agreement with previous results(3.Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 30.Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 639: 129-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), it is clear from Fig. 2 that there appear to be two pathways for reduction of bH and bL by respiratory substrates, one pathway sensitive to I-side and the other to O-side inhibitors. However, these data also show that the available inhibitors (including diuron and stigmatellin) do not cause complete inhibition of either pathway, and depending on the electron leak allowed by the combination of an I-side and an O-side inhibitor at their maximal inhibitory concentrations, the b hemes could be reduced at a faster or a slower rate. As will be seen below, inhibition of the reoxidation of reduced bH and bL by the above inhibitors also leaks. However, the fact that in the experiments of Fig. 2 reduced b accumulated in the presence of an I-side and an O-side inhibitor indicates that these reagents inhibit the oxidation of the b hemes more than their reduction. As was shown earlier(20.Hatefi Y. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1982; 24: 6614-6618Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the post-steady-state reoxidation of the b hemes of complex III through the leak in the antimycin block is biphasic, with bL undergoing reoxidation 10 times faster than bH. Consistent with these results, we also showed that in antimycin-treated SMP, the attenuation of the rate of electron flow from complex I or II to complex III (by using as respiratory substrate NADH in the presence of 2 mM Seconal, succinate at a concentration below its Km, or NADPH that is slowly oxidized by complex I) resulted in the appearance mainly of reduced bH, presumably because the faster oxidation rate of bL through the leak in the antimycin block kept its steady-state level highly oxidized(20.Hatefi Y. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1982; 24: 6614-6618Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). An example of these results is shown in Fig. 3A as a point of reference. It is seen that in antimycin-treated SMP, addition of NADH (solid trace) resulted in roughly twice as much cytochrome b reduction as the addition of NADPH (dashed trace). After near exhaustion of NADH, b was reoxidized at a fast initial rate followed by a slower rate. When the slow NADPH oxidation was inhibited at the level of complex I by the addition of rotenone, the species of b reduced by NADPH was oxidized at a rate comparable with the rate of the slow reoxidation phase of the NADH-treated sample. Fig. 3B shows the absorption spectrum of the α peak of the slow oxidizing b heme species reduced by NADPH (mainly bH, λmax = 563 nm) and the remainder of b reduced in addition to bH by NADH (mainly bL, λmax = 565 nm). In SMP, the inhibition of reoxidation of bH and bL by HQNO, stigmatellin, myxothiazol, or MOA-stilbene also leaked. The reoxidation pattern of the b hemes in the presence of 20-40 μM HQNO was similar to that in the presence of antimycin, except that the leak through the HQNO block was greater (Fig. 3C). ( 2At concentrations ≥60 μM, HQNO caused rapid oxidation of both bL and bH. This effect could not be prevented by pretreatment of SMP with antimycin.) The reoxidation of b through the leak in the stigmatellin block showed two distinct phases, with the decay of reduced bL beginning to plateau before the reoxidation of bH started (data not shown). In this case, the second reoxidation phase was much faster than that shown in Fig. 3A. The patterns of b reduction and reoxidation in the presence of myxothiazol and MOA-stilbene were similar. Heme bL was only partially reduced with either succinate (Fig. 2F) or NADH (Fig. 3, D and E), and when NADH was the substrate, myxothiazol and MOA-stilbene also caused partial inhibition of complex I at the concentrations these inhibitors were used to effect maximal inhibition of complex III. This is shown in Fig. 3, D and E, where the NADH concentration was the same but the myxothiazol concentration was 1 μM in D and 2 μM in E. It is seen that the duration of the b hemes maintained reduced at steady state was longer in E because of the greater inhibition of NADH oxidation by 2 μM myxothiazol at the level of complex I. However, in both experiments D and E, the b hemes underwent a biphasic reoxidation when the concentration of NADH decreased and the rate of electron transfer from complex I to complex III fell below the reoxidation rates of the b hemes. A double exponential analysis of the reoxidation kinetics of b in Fig. 3D is shown in Fig. 4. This is qualitatively similar to the analysis published previously for the reoxidation kinetics of the b hemes of complex III through the leak in the antimycin block(20.Hatefi Y. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1982; 24: 6614-6618Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that regardless of whether the inhibitor is antimycin (an I-side inhibitor) or myxothiazol (an O-side inhibitor), the b hemes reoxidize through the leak in the block by either of these inhibitors in a biphasic manner, with bL undergoing reoxidation at least 10 times faster than bH. It is perhaps important to add that, unlike the combined effects of an I-side and an O-side inhibitor on the reduction of the b hemes, the addition of both types of inhibitors did not cause greater inhibition of the reoxidation of these hemes. This is shown in Fig. 3F, where SMP were treated sequentially with antimycin and NADH and monitored at 563 - 575 nm. After reduction of the b hemes as shown, myxothiazol was added followed by rotenone to inhibit complex I. The addition of rotenone was necessary, because the combination of antimycin and myxothiazol results in a very slow rate of electron transfer to the b hemes (see Fig. 2A), not allowing NADH to become rapidly exhausted. Therefore, electron transfer from complex I to complex III had to be inhibited by rotenone to curtail the otherwise prolonged steady-state phase and demonstrate the reoxidation pattern of the b hemes. We have, however, checked the effect of rotenone added during the steady-state reduction phase in experiments similar to those of Fig. 3, A and D. In either case, the b hemes underwent a biphasic reoxidation, and the only difference was that in the former the reoxidation of bL was faster than that shown in Fig. 3A, which is understandable because of the strong inhibitory effect of rotenone on complex I. It is well known that ascorbate plus TMPD feed electrons to the respiratory chain of SMP at the level of cytochromes c + c1 and possibly the Rieske iron-sulfur protein. As seen in Fig. 5A, when added to bovine SMP, ascorbate + TMPD also partially reduced bH, and when ATP was added to energize SMP, a further reduc"

https://openalex.org/W2017357802,"Several lines of evidence indicate that serine/threonine protein phosphatases may act as negative regulators of cellular growth. For example, treatment of cells with the tumor-promoter okadaic acid, an inhibitor of certain types of these phosphatases, resulted in the increased expression of several proto-oncogenes, indicating a negative role of the respective phosphatases in gene regulation. However, it was puzzling to find that okadaic acid-treated cells, even in the presence of highly expressed proto-oncogenes, did not proliferate, but were arrested at certain points of the cell cycle. To further analyze this discrepancy, we investigated the involvement of protein phosphatases in the control of other cell cycle regulatory genes, such as cdc2, which encodes an essential cell cycle regulatory kinase. We found that cdc2 gene expression was blocked by okadaic acid, but stimulated by protein phosphatase 2A. Protein phosphatase 2A is shown to be a positive regulator of cdc2 gene activity and to be required for cdc2 expression. Thus, our findings identify protein phosphatase 2A as a positive regulator of a major cell cycle regulatory gene and therefore suggest a stimulatory role of this enzyme in this aspect of cellular growth control.

INTRODUCTIONReversible protein phosphorylation appears to be one of the most important reactions contributing to cellular growth control and carcinogenesis. While the role of protein kinases in these processes has been well established, the contribution of protein phosphatases (PPs) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PPprotein phosphatasehGHhuman growth hormoneCMVcytomegalovirusCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay.) is much less clear and has only recently gained more widespread attention.The majority of intracellular phosphatase activity has been attributed to the serine/threonine protein phosphatases type 1 (PP-1) and type 2A (PP-2A)(1.Cohen P.

Daily S.L. Khatra B.S. Dukelow M. Boynton A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6614-6619PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 8.Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Since okadaic acid is a tumor promoter(9.Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Hirota M. Nakayasu M. Ojika M. Wakamatsu K. Yamada K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), it has been concluded that inhibition of these phosphatases may contribute to the tumorigenic transformation of cells. This idea was supported by the finding that the treatment of cells with okadaic acid led to the increased expression of several proto-oncogenes, such as c-fos and c-jun (see detailed references in the review by Schönthal(10.Schönthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar)). Moreover, when added to cells synchronized in the S phase of the cell cycle, okadaic acid caused an increase in the enzymatic activity of histone H1 kinase, an enzyme that is necessary for cell cycle progression(11.Yamashita K. Yasuda H. Pines J. Yasumoto K. Nishitani H. Ohtsubo M. Hunter T. Sugimura T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The drug also stimulated premature mitosis and increased phosphorylation of mitosis-specific proteins(10.Schönthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar).However, while the above referenced evidence demonstrates that okadaic acid is stimulatory for various aspects of cellular growth control, and thus indicates a negative role of the respective phosphatases in these processes, there is also some evidence to the contrary. In many experiments it has been shown that okadaic acid-treated cells do not proliferate, but are blocked at certain stages of the cell cycle(12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Ishida Y. Furukawa Y. DeCaprio J.A. Saito M. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14.Vandré D.D. Wills V.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 79-91PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Sugarman J.L. Thompson A.R. Scavetta R. Glass C.K. Schönthal A.H. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1995; 3: 51-71Google Scholar). Therefore, these latter findings actually may indicate a positive function of the respective phosphatases. Moreover, treatment of cells with okadaic acid blocks the proliferation of cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (16.Dean N.M. Mordan L.J. Tse K. Mooberry S.L. Boynton A.L. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), reverts raf and ret-II oncogene-transformed cells(17.Sakai R. Ikeda I. Kitani H. Fujiki H. Takaku F. Rapp U. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9946-9950Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and induces apoptosis in certain primary as well as transformed cells(18.B⊘e R. Gjertsen B.T. Vintermyr O.K. Houge G. Lanotte M. D⊘skeland S.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). At least some of the growth-inhibitory effects of okadaic acid may be mediated via its block of cdc2 and cyclinA gene expression(12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar). The gene products of cdc2 (= cyclin-dependent kinase, cdk1) and cyclins constitute the catalytic and regulatory subunits of histone H1 kinase, a group of enzymes necessary for cell cycle progression (19.Hu V.W. The Cell Cycle-Regulators, Targets, and Clinical Applications. Plenum Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). Because okadaic acid blocks the synthesis of H1 kinase, there is no H1 kinase activity, and consequently no phosphorylation (inactivation) of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene product(12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Hu V.W. The Cell Cycle-Regulators, Targets, and Clinical Applications. Plenum Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar, 20.Kim T.A. Velasquez B.R. Wenner C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5460-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As a result, the cells are arrested in the cell cycle. However, because okadaic acid affects the activity of several phosphatases, these experiments did not reveal the identity of the phosphatase(s) mediating these effects.Because the negative effect of okadaic acid on cdc2 gene expression indicated a positive role of the respective okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase, we used this system to further define the role of protein phosphatases in the regulation of growth-regulatory genes. We describe here that okadaic acid blocks cdc2 promoter activity. This control is exerted via the inhibition of transcription factor binding to a CCAAT box located at −80 with respect to the start site of transcription. Transfected PP-2A is able to stimulate cdc2 promoter activity and to diminish the negative effect of okadaic acid. Thus, our results identify PP-2A as a positive regulator of a major cell cycle regulatory gene and therefore suggest a stimulatory role of this enzyme in this aspect of cellular growth control.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsOkadaic acid and calyculin A were obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA) and dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 100 μM. Synthetic oligonucleotides were provided by the Core Facility of the K. Norris Jr. Comprehensive Cancer Center.Cell Culture and TransfectionNIH3T3 cells were grown in 10% calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described elsewhere(12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed in 10-cm tissue culture dishes using the calcium-phosphate-DNA precipitation technique (21.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). Briefly, the precipitate was added into the medium, and the cells were incubated over night. Then the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fresh medium with or without okadaic acid.Transfection AnalysisTransiently transfected cells were harvested and analyzed for either luciferase or CAT activity exactly as described(21.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). After lysis and clearing by centrifugation, the protein concentration of each lysate was determined, and the same amount of total cellular protein was used for each assay. Each plasmid was tested by transfection and luciferase assay at least three times. For the determination of transfection efficiency, an expression vector for human growth hormone (hGH) was co-transfected in some of the experiments(22.Selden R.F. Burke Howie K. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The amount of hGH that was secreted into the growth medium was determined with the hGH-TGES 100T Kit (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kit essentially is a solid-phase two-site immunoradiometric assay that uses 125I-labeled and biotin-coupled monoclonal hGH antibodies in combination with avidin-coated polystyrene beads. After a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed to remove unbound components, and the radioactivity bound to the solid phase was measured in a gamma counter. Then the luciferase activity was normalized to the counts/min indicative of hGH expression.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)Nuclear extracts from 108 cells per point were prepared exactly as previously described(21.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). The sequences used for the double-stranded, in vitro synthesized oligonucleotides were as follows: cdc2 CAAT box and neighboring sequences from −100 to −75: 5′-gatccGCTGGGCTCTGATTGGCTGCTTTGa-3′ (the CAAT box, in the reverse, antisense orientation, is underlined); mutated CAAT box: 5′-gatccGCTGGGCTCTGACGATCTGCTTTGa-3′ (mutated box underlined); AP-1 binding site: 5′-gatccGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGCa-3′. In all cases, the 5′-ends of the oligos were BamHI recognition sites and the 3′-ends were BglII sites (lower case letters). For the EMSA, the double-stranded, gel-purified oligos were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extract.Plasmid ConstructsA genomic clone of the human cdc2 gene was obtained from Steven Dalton(23.Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-171804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The cdc2-luciferase deletion mutants are described in Sugarman et al.(24.Sugarman J.L. Schönthal A.H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To generate −74/CAAT, −74/mCAAT, and −74/AP-1, the respective oligonucleotides (see above) were cloned as BamHI/BglII fragments into the BamHI site that was located at the 5′-end of the cdc2 promoter in construct −74. Construct −74 contains cdc2 promoter sequences from −74 to +75 (with respect to the start of transcription), fused to the luciferase reporter gene(24.Sugarman J.L. Schönthal A.H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3282-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The full-length cDNAs encoding the catalytic subunits of PP-1 (25.Berndt N. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. da Cruz e Silva E.F. da Cruz e Silva O.B. Cohen P.T.W. Isolation and sequence analysis of a cDNA clone encoding a type-1 protein phosphatase catalytic subunit: homology with protein phosphatase 2A.FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and PP-2A (26.Wadzinski B.E. Eisfelder B.J. Peruski L.F. Mumby M.C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16883-16888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cloned into the multiple cloning site of pCMV to generate pCMV-PP-1 and pCMV-PP-2A. Plasmid pCMV was generated by Sheay et al.(27.Sheay W. Nelson S. Martinez I. Chu T.-H. T. Bhatia S. Dornburg R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 856-861PubMed Google Scholar) (there it is called pWS-4) and contains the tripartite leader sequence of an adenovirus in order to enhance translation efficiency.Phosphatase Activity AssaysLysates from NIH3T3 cell cultures that were treated with various concentrations of okadaic acid for 24 h were analyzed essentially as described previously(1.Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Serial dilutions of the respective lysates were incubated in buffer containing [32P]phosphorylase a as a substrate (1.0 μg/μl in a 30-μl total reaction volume) for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of trichloroacetic acid (10% solution), and the released radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The ratio of PP-1 and PP-2A activity was determined by the inclusion of various concentrations of okadaic acid and calyculin A in the in vitro dephosphorylation reaction(1.Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar).RESULTSWe have shown earlier that the treatment of cells with okadaic acid resulted in the inhibition of cdc2 mRNA accumulation(12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze whether this effect could be mediated via the promoter of the gene, we transiently transfected the cdc2 promoter, linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, into NIH3T3 cells. Fig. 1 shows that the CAT activity from cells that were treated with okadaic acid was greatly reduced as compared to untreated control cells. In contrast, okadaic acid did not reduce CAT activity when the promoters of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), c-fos, or the human β-actin gene were analyzed (Fig. 1).Several regulatory elements in the cdc2 promoter have been identified(23.Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-171804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 28.Shimizu M. Ichikawa E. Inoue U Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Nojima H. Okayama H. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2882-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29.Ku D.-H. Wen S.-C. Engelhard A. Nicolaides N.C. Lipson K.E. Marino T.A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2255-2259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such as a high affinity binding site for transcription factor E2F and a consensus CAAT box. Because the E2F binding site appears to be regulated by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), and because the activity of Rb is strictly controlled by its phosphorylation status, we speculated that inhibition of cdc2 transcription by okadaic acid might be mediated via E2F. To analyze this in more detail, we generated various deletion mutants of the cdc2 promoter that were linked to a luciferase reporter construct and analyzed their response to okadaic acid treatment.As summarized in Fig. 2, the CAAT box at −80 is the major element that mediates the negative effects of okadaic acid. Construct −245, which contained cdc2 promoter sequences from −245 to +75, was as strongly down-regulated by okadaic acid as the full-length construct −3200, which is shown in Fig. 1. Deletion of two putative transcription factor binding sites, an E-box and a SP-1 site, did not affect the okadaic acid response (construct −129). Further deletion of the E2F site (construct −92), or mutation of the E2F site (construct −245 mE2F), likewise had only a weak effect. However, when the CAAT box was deleted (construct -74), or mutated (construct -245 mCAAT), the down-regulation of cdc2 promoter activity by okadaic acid was lost (Fig. 2). A double mutant, where both the E2F site and the CAAT box were mutated (construct -245 mEmC), also was not affected by okadaic acid.Figure 2:Repression of various cdc2 deletion mutants by okadaic acid (OA). Cells were transiently transfected with luciferase-reporter constructs harboring various portions of the cdc2 promoter. Then cells were treated with 50 nM okadaic acid and harvested 24 h later. Luciferase activity was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Repetitions of this experiment yielded similar results. The luciferase activity of construct −245 in the absence of okadaic acid was arbitrarily set to 100. Numbers to the right indicate fold reduction of luciferase activity in the presence of okadaic acid. The boxes in the promoter region indicate transcription factor binding sites. Crossed boxes indicate that the respective site has been inactivated by mutation. In the bottom three constructs the sites for CAAT, mutated CAAT, and AP-1 were generated with synthetic oligonucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm the importance of the CAAT box in mediating the negative effects of okadaic acid, we generated synthetic oligonucleotides representing either the CAAT box, an AP-1 binding site, or a mutated form of the CAAT box. Each oligo was inserted into the construct −74 in place of the original CAAT box. As shown in Fig. 2, insertion of the synthesized CAAT box (construct -74/CAAT) restored the negative effect of okadaic acid, whereas the mutated form (construct -74/mCAAT) did not. In contrast, insertion of the AP-1 binding site was not able to restore the negative effects of okadaic acid (Fig. 2, construct -74/AP-1).We then used EMSAs to study whether okadaic acid would affect the binding of transcription factors to the CAAT box. For that purpose, cells were treated with okadaic acid for various times, and nuclear extracts were analyzed for their binding activity toward oligonucleotides representing the CAAT box of the cdc2 promoter. A representative result of several repetitions of this experiment is shown in Fig. 3. Okadaic acid caused a time-dependent reduction of binding activity. After 12 h, binding activity was reduced to less than half, whereas after 24 h a reduction to 1-10% was typically observed. In contrast, the use of an AP-1 oligonucleotide in the EMSA resulted in a transient stimulation of binding activity. Taken together, this indicated that okadaic acid reduced cdc2 promoter activity by preventing the binding of a transcription factor(s) to the CAAT box.Figure 3:Band shift analysis (EMSA) of transcription factor binding during okadaic acid treatment. Cells were treated with okadaic acid for the indicated times, then nuclear extracts were prepared. The extracts were incubated with an oligonucleotide representing either the CAAT box of the cdc2 promoter or a consensus AP-1 binding site, and separated by PAGE. Shown is only the part of the gel that contained protein-DNA complexes. The weak band below the major band with the CAAT oligo was not consistently observed. In some repetitions of the experiment the reduction in binding activity to the CAAT oligo at 24 h was even stronger or lost completely.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because okadaic acid is able to affect the activity of several phosphatases, we next set out to determine which one might be involved in the regulation of the cdc2 promoter. First, we used increasing concentrations of okadaic acid to compare the kinetics of phosphatase inhibition with the down-regulation of cdc2-promoter activity. Cells were treated with okadaic acid and the activity of PP-1 and PP-2A was measured in parallel to cdc2-luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 4A, okadaic acid concentrations of up to 50 nM did not affect PP-1 activity. However, the activity of PP-2A was gradually reduced and paralleled the down-regulation of cdc2-luciferase activity that is shown in Fig. 4B.Figure 4:Effects of various concentrations of okadaic acid on phosphatase and luciferase activity. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of okadaic acid for 24 h and analyzed for A, PP-1 and PP-2A phosphatase activity, and B, luciferase activity of a transiently transfected cdc2-luciferase construct(−245). See “Experimental Procedures” for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The results above indicated that PP-2A might be involved in positive cdc2 promoter regulation. To confirm this, we co-transfected cdc2-luciferase together with an expression vector for the catalytic subunit of PP-2A. Because okadaic acid inhibits phosphatase activity and down-regulates cdc2 promoter activity, we expected to see increased cdc2 promoter activity in the presence of elevated PP-2A levels. Indeed, co-transfected PP-2A stimulated cdc2-luciferase activity (Fig. 5A). This effect was specific for this type of phosphatase, as co-transfected PP-1 catalytic subunit did not stimulate, but rather weakly reduced, cdc2 promoter activity (Fig. 5A).Figure 5:Effects of co-transfected phosphatases on cdc2-luciferase activity. A, plasmid −245 (cdc2-luciferase, 3 μg) was co-transfected with 10 μg of an expression vector containing the cDNA of the catalytic subunit of either PP-2A or PP-1 (CMV PP-2A and CMV PP-1, respectively). As a control, the expression vector without the insert (CMV control), or small denatured salmon sperm DNA (s.d. DNA), was co-transfected. In B, the indicated cdc2-luciferase constructs were co-transfected with either an expression vector for PP-2A (+PP2A) or with the vector without the PP-2A insert (Control). Numbers reflect the fold induction of luciferase activity in the presence of co-transfected PP-2A. In C, construct −245 was co-transfected with PP-2A (+PP2A) or vector without PP-2A insert (-PP2A), and then cells were treated with increasing concentrations of okadaic acid. The luciferase activity of construct −245 without okadaic acid treatment was arbitrarily set to 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next sought to define the promoter elements that mediated the stimulatory effect of PP-2A. Various mutants of the cdc2 promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene were co-transfected with the catalytic subunit of PP-2A. As shown in Fig. 5B, the stimulatory effect was somewhat reduced when the E2F binding site was mutated (construct -245 mE2F). However, it was lost completely when the CAAT box was inactivated (construct -245 mCAAT), indicating that the positive regulation by PP-2A was mainly mediated via the CAAT box element.To further confirm the stimulatory effect of PP-2A on cdc2 promoter activity, we investigated whether elevated levels of PP-2A could counteract the negative effects of okadaic acid. We therefore co-transfected cdc2-luciferase with PP-2A in the presence of various concentrations of okadaic acid. As shown in Fig. 5C, co-transfected PP-2A significantly reduced the negative effects of okadaic acid. At 50 nM okadaic acid treatment, cdc2-luciferase activity was 2.5-fold higher when PP-2A was co-transfected. Taken together, these results identify PP-2A as a positive regulator of cdc2 promoter activity.DISCUSSIONThe tumor promoter okadaic acid has proven very useful to study various aspects of serine/threonine protein phosphatase function. However, even at low concentrations this drug inhibits several of these enzymes simultaneously, making it difficult to ascribe a certain effect to a single phosphatase(6.Konkanen R.E. Zwiller J. Daily S.L. Khatra B.S. Dukelow M. Boynton A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6614-6619PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Brewis N.D. Street A.J. Prescott A.R. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 8.Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Moreover, even though several experiments demonstrated stimulatory effects of okadaic acid on certain aspects of cell growth, there are also findings to the contrary. For example, okadaic acid treatment of cells differentially affects the expression of two genes that are required for cellular growth: it induces expression of c-fos(10.Schönthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar), but inhibits expression of cdc2(12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar) (this study). The latter finding is particularly intriguing because it suggests a positive role of the respective phosphatase in growth-regulatory gene expression.In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of cdc2 expression by okadaic acid occurs at the promoter level, and that the phosphatase involved in this regulation is PP-2A. These results indicate that PP-2A acts as a positive regulator of cdc2 expression. This finding is somewhat puzzling, because it has been shown earlier that PP-2A is identical to INH, an inhibitor of histone H1 (cdc2/cyclin) kinase activity(30.Lee T.H. Solomon M.J. Mumby M.C. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 64: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, one needs to keep in mind that these two antagonistic effects of PP-2A occur at different levels and at different stages of the cell cycle. First, inhibition of the enzymatic activity of histone H1 kinase by INH is posttranslational, whereas stimulation of the cdc2 promoter by PP-2A is transcriptional. Second, INH activity is present in G2(30.Lee T.H. Solomon M.J. Mumby M.C. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 64: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas transcriptional regulation occurs throughout the cell cycle, but mainly in late G1 and S (12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that PP-2A activity, on one side, contributes to the elevated expression of cdc2 and, on the other side, participates in keeping the kinase activity in check until sufficient amounts have accumulated.Several consensus transcription factor binding sites have been identified in the cdc2 promoter, such as E2F, CAAT, and SP-1 sites(23.Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-171804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 28.Shimizu M. Ichikawa E. Inoue U Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Nojima H. Okayama H. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2882-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29.Ku D.-H. Wen S.-C. Engelhard A. Nicolaides N.C. Lipson K.E. Marino T.A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2255-2259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show that the effects of okadaic acid and PP-2A on cdc2 promoter activity are mediated mainly via the inverted CAAT box element located at −80 (with respect to the start of transcription). The E2F binding site, which is the main element to confer induction of cdc2 transcription during G1 to S phase progression(23.Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-171804Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 28.Shimizu M. Ichikawa E. Inoue U Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Nojima H. Okayama H. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2882-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), appears to play only a minor role in this regulation by PP-2A.The mechanisms by which the CAAT box serves as a target for negative regulation in response to okadaic acid remain to be determined. The observation that treatment of cells with okadaic acid results in decreased levels of CAAT box binding activity suggests the possibility that inhibition simply reflects the loss of a critical activator. While this mechanism may contribute to negative regulation, additional mechanisms are likely to be involved, because mutation of the CAAT box in the context of the −245-base pair cdc2 promoter (construct −245 mCAAT) does not result in decreased promoter activity. Thus, it remains possible that an active repressive function is mediated through a CAAT box binding protein via interactions with a co-repressor molecule. This scheme would be analogous to the mechanisms by which the retinoblastoma protein actively represses transcription through the E2F binding site(31.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). Testing this hypothesis will require the identification of the relevant CAAT box binding proteins that mediate negative regulation in response to okadaic acid.The finding that PP-2A participates in the control of cdc2 gene expression further supports the idea that this enzyme plays an important role in cellular growth regulation and potentially carcinogenesis. However, it also underscores the notion that protein phosphatases cannot be readily classified as negative regulators of growth. It appears that these types of enzymes play positive as well as negative roles in these processes. The respective function may depend on many variables, such as associated subunits, intracellular distribution, posttranslational modifications, and cell cycle stages (32.Kamibayashi C. Estes R. Slaughter C. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13251-13260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L.

INTRODUCTIONReversible protein phosphorylation appears to be one of the most important reactions contributing to cellular growth control and carcinogenesis. While the role of protein kinases in these processes has been well established, the contribution of protein phosphatases (PPs) ( 1The abbreviations used are: PPprotein phosphatasehGHhuman growth hormoneCMVcytomegalovirusCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assay.) is much less clear and has only recently gained more widespread attention.The majority of intracellular phosphatase activity has been attributed to the serine/threonine protein phosphatases type 1 (PP-1) and type 2A (PP-2A)(1.Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 2.Shenolikar S. Narin A.C. Adv.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar). These two enzymes have generally been considered as negative regulators of cellular growth. They are assumed to be necessary to revert growth-stimulatory phosphorylation cascades initiated by binding of growth factors to their cognate cell surface receptors. Further support for this view came from the use of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP-1 and PP-2A(5.Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar), and of other recently discovered serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP-3, PP-4, and PP-5) (6.Konkanen R.E. Zwiller J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4278-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Since okadaic acid is a tumor promoter(9.Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Hirota M. Nakayasu M. Ojika M. Wakamatsu K. Yamada K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), it has been concluded that inhibition of these phosphatases may contribute to the tumorigenic transformation of cells. This idea was supported by the finding that the treatment of cells with okadaic acid led to the increased expression of several proto-oncogenes, such as c-fos and c-jun (see detailed references in the review by Schönthal(10.Schönthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar)). Moreover, when added to cells synchronized in the S phase of the cell cycle, okadaic acid caused an increase in the enzymatic activity of histone H1 kinase, an enzyme that is necessary for cell cycle progression(11.Yamashita K. Yasuda H. Pines J. Yasumoto K. Nishitani H. Ohtsubo M. Hunter T. Sugimura T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The drug also stimulated premature mitosis and increased phosphorylation of mitosis-specific proteins(10.Schönthal A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar).However, while the above referenced evidence demonstrates that okadaic acid is stimulatory for various aspects of cellular growth control, and thus indicates a negative role of the respective phosphatases in these processes, there is also some evidence to the contrary. In many experiments it has been shown that okadaic acid-treated cells do not proliferate, but are blocked at certain stages of the cell cycle(12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Ishida Y. Furukawa Y. DeCaprio J.A. Saito M. Griffin J.D. J. Cell.

Glass C.K. Schönthal A.H. Mol. Cell. Differ. 1995; 3: 51-71Google Scholar). Therefore, these latter findings actually may indicate a positive function of the respective phosphatases. Moreover, treatment of cells with okadaic acid blocks the proliferation of cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (16.Dean N.M. Mordan L.J. Tse K. Mooberry S.L. Boynton A.L. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), reverts raf and ret-II oncogene-transformed cells(17.Sakai R. Ikeda I. Kitani H. Fujiki H. Takaku F. Rapp U. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9946-9950Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and induces apoptosis in certain primary as well as transformed cells(18.B⊘e R. Gjertsen B.T. Vintermyr O.K. Houge G. Lanotte M. D⊘skeland S.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). At least some of the growth-inhibitory effects of okadaic acid may be mediated via its block of cdc2 and cyclinA gene expression(12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar). The gene products of cdc2 (= cyclin-dependent kinase, cdk1) and cyclins constitute the catalytic and regulatory subunits of histone H1 kinase, a group of enzymes necessary for cell cycle progression (19.Hu V.W. The Cell Cycle-Regulators, Targets, and Clinical Applications. Plenum Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). Because okadaic acid blocks the synthesis of H1 kinase, there is no H1 kinase activity, and consequently no phosphorylation (inactivation) of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene product(12.Schönthal A. Feramisco J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 433-441PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Hu V.W. The Cell Cycle-Regulators, Targets, and Clinical Applications. Plenum Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar, 20.Kim T.A. Velasquez B.R. Wenner C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5460-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As a result, the cells are arrested in the cell cycle. However, because okadaic acid affects the activity of several phosphatases, these experiments did not reveal the identity of the phosphatase(s) mediating these effects.Because the negative effect of okadaic acid on cdc2 gene expression indicated a positive role of the respective okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase, we used this system to further define the role of protein phosphatases in the regulation of growth-regulatory genes. We describe here that okadaic acid blocks cdc2 promoter activity. This control is exerted via the inhibition of transcription factor binding to a CCAAT box located at −80 with respect to the start site of transcription. Transfected PP-2A is able to stimulate cdc2 promoter activity and to diminish the negative effect of okadaic acid. Thus, our results identify PP-2A as a positive regulator of a major cell cycle regulatory gene and therefore suggest a stimulatory role of this enzyme in this aspect of cellular growth control."

Bleomycin (Blm) ( 1The abbreviations used are: BlmbleomycinNOEnuclear Overhauser effectNOESYNOE spectroscopy.) is an antitumor agent used to treat human cancer. It is comprised of metal- and DNA-binding domains linked by a peptide and a disaccharide unit (Fig. 1). Fe(II)-Blm reacts with O2 and reductants to generate HO2−-Fe(III)-Blm, which initiates single and double strand DNA cleavage and base release (Burger et al., 1981; Petering et al., 1990; Sam et al., 1994; Stubbe and Kozarich, 1987). Efficient reaction is due, in part, to the binding of the drug to DNA through the bithiazole and positively charged R group (Chien et al., 1977). There is definite site selectivity for the reactions of Fe-Blm with DNA to produce strand cleavage or base release. The drug prefers initial attack on the deoxyribose unit of the sequences 5′-GpT-3′ and 5′-GpC-3′ (McLean et al., 1989; Steighner and Povirk, 1990). bleomycin nuclear Overhauser effect NOE spectroscopy. The redox chemistry of Fe-Blm in solution or bound to DNA can be modeled closely by Co-Blm (Xu et al., 1992a, 1992b). Both form dioxygenated complexes, which undergo dimerization to reach a peroxyl species, HO2−-Co(III)-Blm (Form I) and Co(III)-Blm (Form II) or the corresponding iron species. However, in contrast to HO2−-Fe(III)-Blm, its cobalt analog is stable in the presence of DNA. The three-dimensional conformations of the two Co-Blm structures have been determined by NMR spectroscopy (Xu et al., 1994). Both forms display extensively folded structures in which the peptide linker is close-packed against the metal domain. In addition, in Form I the bithiazole moiety is folded back over the metal domain. These structures also bind tightly to DNA, offering the opportunity to examine them complexed with DNA as models for the related Fe-Blms (Xu et al., 1992b). Recent communications have begun to reveal how metallobleomycins bind to DNA. NMR data on the interaction of Form I with DNA 10-mer, d(CCAGGCCTGG)2 showed that the complex binds in slow exchange with DNA and that the bithiazole moiety partially intercalated into the base pair structure between C6 and C7 directly adjacent to the GpC cleavage site (Wu et al., 1994). Based on provisional NOE assignments, it was proposed that the pyrimidine methyl group of Form I was in the proximity of a 2-amino proton of G5 at the site. Another study on the interaction of Zn-Blm with DNA concluded that Blm binds in the minor groove in rapid exchange with oligomeric DNA (Manderville et al., 1994; Manderville et al., 1995). The finding that Form I and Zn-Blm bind differently to DNA oligomers despite containing the same linker and DNA binding domains suggests that metal domain properties play a key role in the binding process. From NMR studies and associated molecular dynamic calculations, it appears that the metal domains of Forms I and II Co-Blm bind Co(III) with opposite chiralities (Xu et al., 1994). Therefore, it was hypothesized that Forms I and II should associate differently with DNA. The present study compares the interaction of Forms I and II with a DNA 10-mer containing a GpC site to test this hypothesis. It also examines the binding of Form I to another DNA oligomer bearing a GpT site to determine whether the features of binding of Form I to DNA are common to different preferential binding sites. Syntheses of d(GGAAGCTTCC) and d(AAACGTTT) were accomplished using a Millipore Cyclone Plus DNA synthesizer and nucleotide amidites from Millipore as starting materials. The method followed directions provided by the manufacturer except as modified below (Millipore, 1989). After synthesis of 30 mmol of either oligomer, each was cleaved from the support and fully deprotected by incubation for 48 h in 30% ammonium hydroxide. Purification of the oligomers was done with a Millipore C8 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm). Solvent A contained 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 6.5, and 5% acetonitrile. Solvent B was a mixture of 0.1 M sodium acetate and 65% acetonitrile. The gradient began with 100% solvent A and reached 100% solvent B in 45 min with a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min. Finally, to remove trityl groups, 6 ml of 80% acetic acid was incubated for 1 h with oligomer. To separate the dimethoxytrityl groups from the oligomer, a Sephadex G-15 desalting column was used with 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4, as the eluate buffer. Blenoxane, the clinical mixture primarily of Blm A2 and B2, was a gift of Bristol Myers Co. Bleomycin A2 was isolated from Blenoxane as described previously (Xu et al., 1994). Then, a one-to-one mixture of Form I and Form II was made by reacting Blm A2 with Co(II)Cl2 with stirring under aerobic conditions. The mixture was separated by high pressure liquid chromatography using a 250 × 4.6-mm C18 reverse phase semipreparative column (Bio-Rad) with the following gradient. Solvent A contained water and 0.2% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Solvent B was methanol. The gradient changed linearly from 70% solvent A and 30% solvent B to 63% solvent A and 37% solvent B within 10 min at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. When 200-μl fractions were collected, two peaks appeared in the chromatogram representing Form II and Form I with characteristic retention times of 7.8 and 8.9 min, respectively. In order to remove trifluoroacetic acid and methanol from the isolated Form I or Form II mixtures, the samples were lyophilized several times in water. The Form I or Form II DNA adducts were made by mixing isolated Co-Blm species with DNAa or DNAb. Proton NMR spectra were acquired at 500 MHz on a GE GN500 NMR spectrometer. Phase-sensitive two-dimensional spectra were acquired using TPPI-States phase cycling (Marion et al., 1989). NOESY spectra were acquired in D2O with a mixing time of 250 ms at 15 and 25°C (Jeener, et al., 1979; Macura et al., 1981). TOCSY spectra were acquired in D2O at 15°C with a mixing time of 80 ms using a WALTZ-17y mixing scheme (Bax, 1989; Braunschweiler and Ernst, 1983). The proton sweep widths in the D2O spectra were set to 6024 Hz, centered on the water resonance, with 2048 complex points acquired in t2, and 256 complex t1 increments collected, corresponding to acquisition times of 340 and 42 ms in the two dimensions. The residual HOD peak was suppressed with an on resonance DANTE pulse sequence applied during the second half of the 1-s recovery delay between scans. NOESY spectra in 90% H2O, 10% D2O were acquired with mixing times of 200 ms at 5 and 15°C. The water resonance was suppressed using a “jump and return” read pulse, with an 80-μs delay between pulses, corresponding to excitation maxima of ± 3125 Hz from the carrier frequency centered on the water resonance (Plateau and Gueron, 1982). A 45° phase shift was added to the normal mixing pulse-phase cycling scheme to minimize radiation damping (Driscoll et al., 1989). The proton sweep widths were set to 12,048 Hz, with 2048 complex points acquired in t2, and 256 complex t1 increments collected, corresponding to acquisition times of 170 and 21 ms in the two dimensions. The delay between scans was 1 s. Typically 96 scans were obtained per free induction decay in all two-dimensional experiments. The NMR data were processed on a Silicon Graphics INDY workstation using Felix 2.3 software (Biosym Technologies, Inc.). Sine-bell squared window functions shifted by 60° followed by 2-Hz exponential multiplication were applied in both dimensions, and the data were zero-filled to 2048 points in t1 prior to Fourier transformation. Polynomial base-line correction was applied to the F2 and F1 dimensions to obtain flat base lines. One-dimensional spectra of samples in 90% H2O, 10% D2O were also acquired using jump and return water suppression. Fluorescence spectra of Co(III)-Blm A2 were recorded with an SLM AMINO 4800C spectrofluorimeter. Excitation at 300 nm produces an intense emission from the bithiazole moiety at 350 nm, which is quenched upon interaction with DNA. Titration of Form I, the DNA 10-mer, with DNAa was carried out in 20 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 and 25°C. Plots of the reduction in fluorescence intensity of the drug molecule as a function of added oligomer were analyzed as described previously using the assumption that Co(III)-Blm A2 binds to equivalent, noninteracting sites on DNA (Chien et al., 1977). From the analysis one can determine K, the association constant, and n, the number of base pairs/binding site, using the following equation, 1/[Form II ⋅ DNAa] = 1/nK[DNAo][Form II] + 1/n[DNAo](Eq. 1) in which [DNAo] represents the total concentration of DNA base pairs. A combination of two-dimensional NMR techniques has been used to examine the complexes of Form I and II bound to two DNA oligomers incorporating either the GpC or GpT sites of cleavage (Petering et al., 1990). The formation of 1:1 complexes of Form I and DNA was monitored by following the disappearance of DNA imino proton resonances. Both drug-DNA oligomer complexes were in slow exchange on the NMR time scale as illustrated by the observation of distinct resonances for free and bound DNA in the imino region of the spectrum at intermediate drug-to-DNA concentrations for the titration of d(GGAAGCTTCC) with Form I (Fig. 2). The binding of Form I lifts the 2-fold symmetry of the DNA and thereby splits the degeneracy of its 1H NMR spectra. Fig. 3 illustrates this for the fingerprint region in the NOESY spectrum of the Form I-DNAa complex, showing a sequential NOE pathway for each DNA strand. The sequential cross-peak between C6-H1′ and T7-H6 protons is missing in this region, suggesting that the drug has substantially perturbed this part of the structure. In addition, the sequential cross-peaks between the G15 and T7 imino protons are missing in the H2O NOESY spectrum, and these protons are significantly shifted upfield. These results are consistent with the intercalation of the drug between C6-G15 and T7-A14 (Wüthrich, 1986). A list of intermolecular NOEs involving the bithiazole B5 and B5′ protons in Table 1 confirms this interpretation by showing that these protons interact with several protons in the C6-G15 and T7-A14 base pairs. Together with the upfield shifts in position of the bithiazole B5 and B5′ resonances from 8.11 and 7.77 ppm to 7.04 and 6.97 ppm, respectively, these results confirm that the sulfur-containing edge of the bithiazole intercalates between C6-G15 and T7-A14. Similar data have been obtained from an analysis of the Form I-DNAc adduct, leading to the same interpretation (Wu et al., 1994).Tabled 1 Form I itself retains almost all of the intramolecular NOEs seen in the absence of DNAa at positions similar to those previously reported (Table 2) (Xu et al., 1994). Thus, in the DNAa adduct, extensive folding exists in the peptide linker region, which generates a close-packed structure involving the metal domain and linker similar to that in free Form I. However, the NOE between B5 and pyrimidinyl (P) methyl hydrogens is missing. In the unbound form this NOE shows that the metal domain is folded over the DNA domain (Xu et al., 1994). Evidently, this interaction is lost upon intercalation of the bithiazole into DNA.Tabled 1 The PCH3 protons at 2.55 ppm display NOE interactions with an exchangeable base proton at 10.22 ppm. Although highly shifted, this proton is identified as a G5 2-amino proton on the basis of its NOE connections with G5 1-imino and G5 2-amino hydrogens, which are its nearest neighbor protons (Fig. 4A). Thus, the metal domain is closely associated with the guanine base at the specific cleavage site and within a few angstroms of the binding site for the DNA domain. A large shift of imidazole H2 upon binding to DNA from 8.61 to 9.05 ppm also signals that the metal domain interacts with the oligomer. With the bithiazole intercalated between C6-G15 and T7-A14, the metal domain-linker structure intact, and the metal domain in proximity to G5, it appears that Form I retains a compact, folded structure when bound to DNA. Evidently, Form I can bind to a GpC site of cleavage without substantial reorganization of its solution structure, bringing the minor groove cleavage site of the drug into apposition with the DNA and metal domains. A similar picture is emerging from an examination of the Form I-DNAb adduct. The bithiazole B5 and B5′ proton resonances are shifted to a higher field (8.11 and 7.77 ppm to 6.85 and 6.73 ppm, respectively) upon binding of Form I to DNAb. Correspondingly, the T6 and T7 imino protons are upfield shifted, consistent with the intercalation of the B5-B5′ edge of the bithiazole between T6-A14 and T7-A13. Intermolecular NOEs between these parts of the two molecules also support the binding of the bithiazole to this region of DNAb (Table 1). In addition, as with the Form I-DNAa complex, the folded structure of the metal domain-linker remains in the DNA complex, but the B5-PCH3 NOE is missing (Table 2). Instead, the PCH3 protons make an NOE connection with a G5 2-amino proton (Fig. 4B). Also, the imidazole H2 is highly shifted from 8.69 to 9.14 ppm as in Form I-DNAa. Clearly, Form I binds to both sites, GpC and GpT, with closely related conformations. Form II binds to DNAa in faster exchange than Form I and does not break the 2-fold symmetry of the DNAa NOESY spectrum (Fig. 5 and 6). In data not shown, the fast exchange regions for the adduct existed over the temperature ranges of 5-35°C. Nevertheless, small perturbations in chemical shifts of protons throughout both the drug and DNA structures indicate that a binding interaction does occur. The maintenance of the degenerate, uninterrupted NOE pathway in Fig. 4 shows that Form II does not intercalate into the DNA base structure like Form I. Still, the B5 and B5′ protons are shifted upon interaction with DNAa. As with Form I, almost all of the NOEs seen in solution remain unperturbed in the DNA-bound structure (Table 1). There is no NOE connection between PCH3 and the DNA minor groove as is present in the Form I-DNA structures. Nor have any other intermolecular NOEs been assigned. Furthermore, the highly shifted G5 2-amino proton and H2 proton resonances detected in Form I-DNA adducts are not seen with Form II; instead, they are only modestly perturbed from their solution values (8.58-8.79 and 6.75-6.85 ppm, respectively for H2 and G5 2-amino). Interestingly, the DNA protons in the fingerprint region which are most perturbed by the presence of Form II are those in the GC base pairs at the ends of the 10-mer. Thus, the H6, H5, and H1′ protons of C9 are shifted downfield 0.05, 0.05, and 0.06 ppm, respectively, and, correspondingly, those of C10 are shifted, 0.26, 0.29, and 0.09 ppm. Evidently, Form II-DNAa adopts a different conformation than Form I-DNAa-c, while maintaining much, if not all, of the solution conformation of this form of the drug. The strikingly different properties of binding of Form I and Form II to DNAa prompted the measurement of the association constant of Form II with DNAa. Following a method used previously, Form II was titrated with DNAa and the extent of their interaction determined by the degree of quenching of the bithiazole fluorescence upon binding to the oligomer (Chien et al., 1977). Fig. 7a shows fluorescence emission spectra of Form II in the absence and presence of DNAa. The quenching that was observed is qualitatively similar to that observed when metal-free Blm interacts with DNA (Chien et al., 1977). In Fig. 7, b and c, a summary of the fluorescence titrations is presented, together with the a sample plot of data from one titration based on. Its linearity validates the simple binding model described in. From four titrations the average and standard deviation for the association constant and number of base pairs per binding site were 1.6 ± 0.2 × 105M−1 and 10.2 ± 0.6, respectively. The latter figure indicates that a maximum of one drug molecule associated with each 10-mer. Considering the magnitude of this equilibrium constant and the concentrations used in the NMR experiments under similar conditions, virtually all of the Form II added to DNAa during the NMR titration study became bound to the oligomer. Detailed structural information is beginning to appear about metallobleomycins bound to DNA. The structure of a Zn-Blm DNA oligomer has been published (Manderville et al., 1995). NMR information about a Form I adduct with 10-mer DNA has also been described (Wu et al., 1994). Although a structure for this complex is not yet in hand, comparative NMR studies offer the opportunity to survey how variations in drug structure and DNA sequences affect adduct formation. Previous studies have suggested that the DNA and metal domains of ON-Fe(II)-Blm, OC-Fe(II)-Blm, O2-Fe(II)- and O2-Co(II)-Blm-DNA, and Fe(III)-Blm interact with DNA (Albertini and Garnier-Suillerot, 1984; Antholine and Petering, 1979; Antholine et al., 1981; Chikira et al., 1989; Fulmer and Petering, 1994). Features of the Form I-oligonucleotide structure described above confirm the intimate interaction of both drug domains with DNA. Indeed, in each of the three Form I-DNA structures that have been examined, it is an element of the metal domain that associates with the G5 part of the preferred GpC or GpT site of cleavage. The DNA domain also intercalates between several stacks of base pairs, involving C6-T7, T6-T7, and C6-C7, so the site of the primary interaction of bithiazole is not unique but does include a member of the cleavage site on the 3′ side (Wu et al., 1994). Knowledge of Form I-DNA conformation is derived from several types of NMR information. The intramolecular NOEs in Table 2 show that Form I retains its solution conformation for the linker and metal domain when bound to DNAa and DNAb. The intermolecular NOEs as well as the upfield chemical shifts of the bithiazole protons and protons of the base pairs involving bases at positions 6 and 7 indicate that the bithiazole intercalates into the base pair structure of all three Form I-DNA structures (Table 1 and Wu et al.(1994)). The finding that the PCH3 group in the metal domain is in close proximity to G5 in each structure supports the close association of the metal domain with DNA (Fig. 4). In the Form I complex with d(CCAGGCCTGG)2, the assignment of this NOE to an interaction between a G4 or G5 2-amino proton and PCH3 protons could not be distinguished (Wu et al., 1994). The presence of the same NOE in all three Form I-DNA complexes now supports the identification of this NOE as a G5 2-amino proton-PCH3 proton interaction in each complex. A synthesis of these structural determinants shows that Form I exists in each DNA complex as a structure in which the metal domain and linker are folded similarly to those found in the absence of DNA. Using the unbound structure as a model, the metal domain is in close association with G5, the peroxide coordinated to Co occupies a position between G5 and T6 or C6, and the bithiazole interacts between the base pairs at positions 6 and 7. Evidently, the metal domain as well as the DNA domain interacts with DNA as previously hypothesized and participates in site selectivity at the guanine residue of the GpC and GpT pairs (Xu et al., 1994). This conclusion is buttressed by the finding that the chemical shift of the histidine H2 proton, part of the metal domain, is markedly perturbed in all of the DNA adducts. A role for the metal domain in site selectivity has been previously hypothesized (Carter et al., 1990; Kane and Hecht, 1994). The Form I-DNA conformation is not unique among metallobleomycins bound to DNA; a different one has been reported for Zn-Blm-DNA (Manderville et al., 1994, 1995). On the basis of the present experiments, the binding mode of Form II to DNAa is also distinct from that of Form I. Furthermore, Form II associates with DNA in a conformation that includes extensive folding in the linker region that has not been observed for Zn-Blm either in solution or when bound to DNA (Akkerman et al., 1988, Manderville et al., 1994, 1995). Fluorescence titration experiments have shown that Form II binds to DNAa with an association constant comparable with ones measured for bleomycin and similar to or 10-fold larger than values for Cu-Blm under conditions of low ionic strength (Chien et al., 1977; Povirk et al., 1981; Roy et al., 1981). At 1.7 × 105M−1, it is sufficiently large to insure that virtually all of the detectable drug binds to DNA with the concentrations and ionic strength used in the NMR experiments (Fig. 7). It is also large enough to question whether the fast exchange behavior of Form II in the NMR experiments seen in Fig. 5 results from rapid exchange of Form II either bound to a particular site on the 10-mer or free in solution. An attractive alternative is that Form II slides along the 10-mer such that drug exchanges rapidly between sites on the oligomer while bound to it. Other examples of sliding by ligands binding to DNA oligomers have been hypothesized based on NMR studies in which association between ligand and DNA does not break the symmetry of the DNA NMR spectrum (Leupin et al., 1986; Pelton and Wemmer, 1990). In the present study, the finding that DNA proton chemical shifts were most perturbed in the GC base pairs at the ends of the molecule may also be consistent with this interpretation (data not shown). The lack of any assignable intermolecular NOEs suggests that sliding is very fast, thereby reducing the intensity of NOEs related to any particular drug-site interaction. Because the fast exchange binding of Form II to DNA is qualitatively similar to that of Zn-Blm, the latter complex may also be able to slide along the DNA molecule (Manderville et al., 1994, 1995). The possibility that Form II can slide quickly along DNA stands in contrast to the apparent static binding of O2-Co(II)-Blm to DNA (Xu et al., 1992b). The latter permits such molecules in close proximity along the DNA structure to exist for extended periods without undergoing bimolecular oxidation reduction to produce Form I and Form II (Xu et al., 1992a). It is hypothesized that O2-Co(II)-Blm is folded, possibly like Form I, when bound to DNA (Chikira et al., 1989). The hypothesis that Form II may move along the DNA structure while bound to it suggests that sliding by extended metallobleomycin structures might play a role in the mechanism by which sites are selected for DNA cleavage by the drug. A major question arises from these findings: why does Form II not bind to DNA like Form I? Each contains the same DNA domain structure with its bithiazole and positively charged tail, which provides electrostatic stabilization for the drug-DNA adduct. The net charge on the metal domain of Form I is 1+; the charge of the metal domain of Form II is either 1 or 2+, depending on the charge on the ligand occupying its sixth coordination position, probably either water or hydroxide. Therefore, the positively charged metal domains of both forms should interact favorably with the negative charge of the DNA polymer and not be an obvious source of discrimination between them. A possible answer to this question relates to the fact that Forms I and II may adopt different structures in solution; the first has the bithiazole folded over the metal domain, and the second has the bithiazole tail region extended from the folded metal domain-linker region (Xu et al., 1994). Apparently, these conformations substantially remain in their DNA adducts. According to molecular dynamics calculations on Form I and Form II, the ligand structure in each wraps oppositely about Co(III) to yield two chiral metal domains (Xu et al., 1994). One result of such differential folding is that the two metal domains cannot identically interact with DNA (Xu et al., 1994). This conclusion is consistent with the differential behavior of the H2 and G5 2-amino protons in the two DNA adducts and the lack of an NOE connection between the PCH3 protons and a G5 2-amino proton in the Form II-DNA complex. A related outcome is that the position of the bulky disaccharide is different in the two conformations. A third consequence of the different chiralities is that only in Form I can the bithiazole fold back upon the metal domain in Form I, placing the peroxide between them. In contrast, in Form II it is only possible to fold the DNA domain over the metal domain such that the sixth ligand position is on an outer face of the metal domain, not between them, making it impossible for those two structures to bind similarly to DNA. Therefore, it is suggested that intercalation by the bithiazole requires a specific metal domain configuration, which permits a particular folded conformational relationship to exist between the metal and DNA domains. The reason for this requirement needs further study. We appreciate the use of the spectrofluorimeter in the laboratory of Dr. Sally Twining."

The side chain modified analogs, in which the glycine side chain, R = CH2NH2, has been replaced by R = CH2NHCH3 and R = CH2CH2NH2, are substrates, with V/K (relative intensity) of 2.4% and 16.3%, respectively. Several carbocyclic analogs of glycinamide ribonucleotide, including the phosphonate derivative of carbocyclic glycinamide ribonucleotide, did not serve as substrates, but were inhibitors of the enzyme, competitive against glycinamide ribonucleotide, with K values ranging from 7.4 to 23.6 times the K for glycinamide ribonucleotide. However, the O-phosphonate analog of carbocyclic glycinamide ribonucleotide did support enzymatic activity, with V/K (relative intensity) of 0.8%. In addition, glycinamide ribonucleoside was neither a substrate for, nor an inhibitor of, glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase. Furthermore, α-glycinamide ribonucleotide had no effect on enzyme activity. These studies have begun to define the structural features of the nucleotide substrate required to support enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2080499609,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) binds the heavy chain of the alpha2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). To understand the significance of this interaction, novel toxin-derived gene fusions were constructed with two ligands that also bind this receptor. A 39-kDa cellular protein, termed RAP, binds LRP with high affinity and often co-purifies with it. Two RAP toxins were constructed, one with PE and one with diphtheria toxin (DT). RAP, which replaced the toxins binding domains, was combined with each of the corresponding translocating and ADP-ribosylating domains. Both RAP-toxins bound LRP with an apparent higher affinity than native PE. Despite this, RAP-PE and DT-RAP were less toxic than native PE. Apparently, RAP-toxin molecules bound and entered cells but used a pathway that afforded only low efficiency of toxin transport to the cytosol. This was evident because co-internalization with adenovirus increased the toxicity of RAP-toxins by 10-fold. We speculate that the high affinity of RAP binding may not allow the toxin's translocating and ADP-ribosylating domains to reach the cytosol but rather causes the toxin to take another pathway, possibly one that leads to lysosomes. To test this hypothesis, additional RAP-PE fusions were constructed. N-terminal or C-terminal fragments of RAP were joined to PE to produce two novel fusion proteins which were likely to have reduced affinity for LRP. Both of these shorter fusion proteins exhibited greater toxicity than full-length RAP-PE. A second ligand-toxin gene fusion was constructed between plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and DT. DT-plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 formed a complex with tissue-type plasminogen activator and inhibited its proteolytic activity. However, like the RAP-toxins, this hybrid was less toxic for cells than native PE."
