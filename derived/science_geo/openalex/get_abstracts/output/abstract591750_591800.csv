https://openalex.org/W2584998015,"Neurons in the brain behave as nonlinear oscillators, which develop rhythmic activity and interact to process information. Taking inspiration from this behaviour to realize high-density, low-power neuromorphic computing will require very large numbers of nanoscale nonlinear oscillators. A simple estimation indicates that to fit 108 oscillators organized in a two-dimensional array inside a chip the size of a thumb, the lateral dimension of each oscillator must be smaller than one micrometre. However, nanoscale devices tend to be noisy and to lack the stability that is required to process data in a reliable way. For this reason, despite multiple theoretical proposals and several candidates, including memristive and superconducting oscillators, a proof of concept of neuromorphic computing using nanoscale oscillators has yet to be demonstrated. Here we show experimentally that a nanoscale spintronic oscillator (a magnetic tunnel junction) can be used to achieve spoken-digit recognition with an accuracy similar to that of state-of-the-art neural networks. We also determine the regime of magnetization dynamics that leads to the greatest performance. These results, combined with the ability of the spintronic oscillators to interact with each other, and their long lifetime and low energy consumption, open up a path to fast, parallel, on-chip computation based on networks of oscillators."
https://openalex.org/W2949439905,"Therapeutic options for the treatment of an increasing variety of cancers have been expanded by the introduction of a new class of drugs, commonly referred to as checkpoint blocking agents, that target the host immune system to positively modulate anti-tumor immune response. Although efficacy of these agents has been linked to a pre-existing level of tumor immune infiltrate, it remains unclear why some patients exhibit deep and durable responses to these agents while others do not benefit. To examine the influence of tumor genetics on tumor immune state, we interrogated the relationship between somatic mutation and copy number alteration with infiltration levels of 7 immune cell types across 40 tumor cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Levels of cytotoxic T, regulatory T, total T, natural killer, and B cells, as well as monocytes and M2 macrophages, were estimated using a novel set of transcriptional signatures that were designed to resist interference from the cellular heterogeneity of tumors. Tumor mutational load and estimates of tumor purity were included in our association models to adjust for biases in multi-modal genomic data. Copy number alterations, mutations summarized at the gene level, and position-specific mutations were evaluated for association with tumor immune infiltration. We observed a strong relationship between copy number loss of a large region of chromosome 9p and decreased lymphocyte estimates in melanoma, pancreatic, and head/neck cancers. Mutations in the oncogenes PIK3CA, FGFR3, and RAS/RAF family members, as well as the tumor suppressor TP53, were linked to changes in immune infiltration, usually in restricted tumor types. Associations of specific WNT/beta-catenin pathway genetic changes with immune state were limited, but we noted a link between 9p loss and the expression of the WNT receptor FZD3, suggesting that there are interactions between 9p alteration and WNT pathways. Finally, two different cell death regulators, CASP8 and DIDO1, were often mutated in head/neck tumors that had higher lymphocyte infiltrates. In summary, our study supports the relevance of tumor genetics to questions of efficacy and resistance in checkpoint blockade therapies. It also highlights the need to assess genome-wide influences during exploration of any specific tumor pathway hypothesized to be relevant to therapeutic response. Some of the observed genetic links to immune state, like 9p loss, may influence response to cancer immune therapies. Others, like mutations in cell death pathways, may help guide combination therapeutic approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2737174875,"The origin of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides and the nature of the 'normal' state above the critical temperature are widely debated. In underdoped copper oxides, this normal state hosts a pseudogap and other anomalous features; and in the overdoped materials, the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer description fails, challenging the idea that the normal state is a simple Fermi liquid. To investigate these questions, we have studied the behaviour of single-crystal La2-xSrxCuO4 films through which an electrical current is being passed. Here we report that a spontaneous voltage develops across the sample, transverse (orthogonal) to the electrical current. The dependence of this voltage on probe current, temperature, in-plane device orientation and doping shows that this behaviour is intrinsic, substantial, robust and present over a broad range of temperature and doping. If the current direction is rotated in-plane by an angle ϕ, the transverse voltage oscillates as sin(2ϕ), breaking the four-fold rotational symmetry of the crystal. The amplitude of the oscillations is strongly peaked near the critical temperature for superconductivity and decreases with increasing doping. We find that these phenomena are manifestations of unexpected in-plane anisotropy in the electronic transport. The films are very thin and epitaxially constrained to be tetragonal (that is, with four-fold symmetry), so one expects a constant resistivity and zero transverse voltage, for every ϕ. The origin of this anisotropy is purely electronic-the so-called electronic nematicity. Unusually, the nematic director is not aligned with the crystal axes, unless a substantial orthorhombic distortion is imposed. The fact that this anisotropy occurs in a material that exhibits high-temperature superconductivity may not be a coincidence."
https://openalex.org/W2737422248,"Experimental and computed nuclear magnetic resonance data and an iterative synthetic strategy have revealed the correct structures of the baulamycins, potentially important antimicrobial compounds, allowing them to be chemically synthesized. Molecules are often drawn as though they are static chemical structures, but of course in reality they adopt a number of different conformations. The structures of flexible compounds are especially difficult to pin down by conventional means as they can appear as a mixture of conformational isomers. Baulamycins, polyketide antibiotics with long, flexible carbon chains, are one such example and, although they have been the target of synthetic efforts, the true structure of the natural product is unclear. Here, Varinder Aggarwal and colleagues elucidate the structure of the baulamycins by a method based on the correlation of experimental and computed nuclear magnetic resonance data and an iterative synthetic strategy to the target compounds. This approach allowed the unambiguous and correct assignment of the stereocentres and the structure of these natural products and could be applied to other such complex, flexible systems. Small-molecule, biologically active natural products continue to be our most rewarding source of, and inspiration for, new medicines1. Sometimes we happen upon such molecules in minute quantities in unique, difficult-to-reach, and often fleeting environments, perhaps never to be discovered again. In these cases, determining the structure of a molecule—including assigning its relative and absolute configurations—is paramount, enabling one to understand its biological activity. Molecules that comprise stereochemically complex acyclic and conformationally flexible carbon chains make such a task extremely challenging2. The baulamycins (A and B) serve as a contemporary example. Isolated in small quantities and shown to have promising antimicrobial activity, the structure of the conformationally flexible molecules was determined largely through J-based configurational analysis3,4, but has been found to be incorrect. Our subsequent campaign to identify the true structures of the baulamycins has revealed a powerful method for the rapid structural elucidation of such molecules. Specifically, the prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters through density functional theory—combined with an efficient sequence of boron-based synthetic transformations, which allowed an encoded (labelled) mixture of natural-product diastereomers to be prepared—enabled us rapidly to pinpoint and synthesize the correct structures."
https://openalex.org/W2736990389,"The prompt optical flash produced by the γ-ray burst GRB 160625B is highly linearly polarized, suggesting that it is produced by fast-cooling synchrotron radiation in a large-scale magnetic field. γ-ray bursts are thought to be powered by collimated jets of material at relativistic energies. Previous observations have revealed ordered magnetic fields associated with the initial afterglow, but measurements of the prompt flash using polarized light, which is sensitive to the presence of magnetic fields, have been ambiguous. Eleonora Troja and colleagues report significant and variable linear polarization of the prompt optical flash from γ-ray burst GRB 160625B. They conclude that the polarization arises in fast-cooling synchrotron radiation in a large-scale magnetic field. They infer that the field is being advected from a black hole created in the stellar collapse that led to the burst. Newly formed black holes of stellar mass launch collimated outflows (jets) of ionized matter that approach the speed of light. These outflows power prompt, brief and intense flashes of γ-rays known as γ-ray bursts (GRBs), followed by longer-lived afterglow radiation that is detected across the electromagnetic spectrum. Measuring the polarization of the observed GRB radiation provides a direct probe of the magnetic fields in the collimated jets. Rapid-response polarimetric observations of newly discovered bursts have probed the initial afterglow phase1,2,3, and show that, minutes after the prompt emission has ended, the degree of linear polarization can be as high as 30 per cent—consistent with the idea that a stable, globally ordered magnetic field permeates the jet at large distances from the central source3. By contrast, optical4,5,6 and γ-ray7,8,9 observations during the prompt phase have led to discordant and often controversial10,11,12 results, and no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the origin of the prompt radiation or the configuration of the magnetic field. Here we report the detection of substantial (8.3 ± 0.8 per cent from our most conservative simulation), variable linear polarization of a prompt optical flash that accompanied the extremely energetic and long-lived prompt γ-ray emission from GRB 160625B. Our measurements probe the structure of the magnetic field at an early stage of the jet, closer to its central black hole, and show that the prompt phase is produced via fast-cooling synchrotron radiation in a large-scale magnetic field that is advected from the black hole and distorted by dissipation processes within the jet."
https://openalex.org/W2740803597,"Most of the thermal tolerance studies on fish have been performed on juveniles and adults, whereas limited information is available for larvae, a stage which may have a particularly narrow range in tolerable temperatures. Moreover, previous studies on thermal limits for marine and freshwater fish larvae (53 studies reviewed here) applied a wide range of methodologies (e.g. the static or dynamic method, different exposure times), making it challenging to compare across taxa. We measured the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax) of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae using the dynamic method (ramping assay) and assessed the effect of warming rate (0.5 to 9°C h-1) and acclimation temperature. The larvae of herring had a lower CTmax (lowest and highest values among 222 individual larvae, 13.1-27.0°C) than seabass (lowest and highest values among 90 individual larvae, 24.2-34.3°C). At faster rates of warming, larval CTmax significantly increased in herring, whereas no effect was observed in seabass. Higher acclimation temperatures led to higher CTmax in herring larvae (2.7 ± 0.9°C increase) with increases more pronounced at lower warming rates. Pre-trials testing the effects of warming rate are recommended. Our results for these two temperate marine fishes suggest using a warming rate of 3-6°C h-1: CTmax is highest in trials of relatively short duration, as has been suggested for larger fish. Additionally, time-dependent thermal tolerance was observed in herring larvae, where a difference of up to 8°C was observed in the upper thermal limit between a 0.5- or 24-h exposure to temperatures >18°C. The present study constitutes a first step towards a standard protocol for measuring thermal tolerance in larval fish."

CD33 generates two splice variants: a full-length CD33M transcript produced primarily by the “LOAD-risk” allele and a shorter CD33m isoform lacking the sialic acid-binding domain produced primarily from the “LOAD-protective” allele. An SNP that modulates CD33 splicing to favor CD33m is associated with enhanced microglial activity. Individuals expressing more protective isoform accumulate less brain β-amyloid and have a lower LOAD risk. How the CD33m isoform increases β-amyloid clearance remains unknown. We report that the protection by the CD33m isoform may not be conferred by what it does but, rather, from what it cannot do. Analysis of blood neutrophils and monocytes and a microglial cell line revealed that unlike CD33M, the CD33m isoform does not localize to cell surfaces; instead, it accumulates in peroxisomes. Cell stimulation and activation did not mobilize CD33m to the surface. Thus, the CD33m isoform may neither interact directly with amyloid plaques nor engage in cell-surface signaling. Rather, production and localization of CD33m in peroxisomes is a way of diminishing the amount of CD33M and enhancing β-amyloid clearance. We confirmed intracellular localization by generating a CD33m-specific monoclonal antibody. Of note, CD33 is the only Siglec with a peroxisome-targeting sequence, and this motif emerged by convergent evolution in toothed whales, the only other mammals with a prolonged post-reproductive lifespan.

Subsequent studies led to isolation of four-subunit active forms of Pol ζ in three different laboratories (34.Makarova A.V. Stodola J.L. Burgers P.M.

The crystal structure of the yeast Pol α B subunit in complex with the cognate CTD reported by the Pellegrini group (27.Klinge S. Núñez-Ramírez R. Llorca O.

Biol. 2009; 10: 82Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, some putatively important details are missing in the structure of the yeast B subunit, because the construct used lacked its 247 N-terminal amino acid residues. Here we report the crystallization, structure determination, and comparative structural analysis of the full-length human Pol α B-subunit in complex with p180C. The cDNA encoding for p180 (1–1462) was generously provided by Dr. Motoshi Suzuki (Nagoya University), and the cDNA for p70 (1–598) was purchased from the Open Biosystems (clone ID 2822514). A pETHSUL vector expressing the first 98 residues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SMT3 (SUMO) with an N-terminal His tag and a pSUPER vector expressing SUMO-specific protease dtUD1 (doubly tagged UD1) were a generous gift from Dr. Patrick Loll (Drexel University). dtUD1 was expressed and purified as described in Ref. 37.Weeks S.D. Drinker M. Loll P.J. Ligation independent cloning vectors for expression of SUMO fusions.Protein Expr. Purif. 2007; 53: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar. The genes for the full-length p70 and p180C (1265–1444) with an N-terminal His8-SUMO tag were subcloned into the pETDuet-1 vector (Novagen) using NcoI/BamHI and NdeI/KpnI (TaKaRa) restriction sites, respectively. The DNA coding for the His8-SUMO tag was amplified from a pETHSUL vector (two histidines were added to original His6 tag at that time) and attached to the fragment encoding p180C by fusion PCR (38.Shevchuk N.A.

Construction of long DNA molecules using long PCR-based fusion of several fragments simultaneously.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e19Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The human His-SUMO-p180C-p70 complex was expressed for 16 h (18 °C) in Escherichia coli strain Rosetta-2(DE3) in LB medium after induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After cell disruption using Emulsiflex-C5, the protein complex was purified using sequential Ni-IDA (Bio-Rad), HiTrap Q, and HiTrap SP (GE Healthcare) columns. His6-tagged dtUD1 protease was added at a 1:200 molar ratio in the process of purification to cleave the His8-SUMO tag. Finally, the protein solution was applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), and peak fractions were combined and concentrated to 9.7 mg ml−1 in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. The concentrated protein solution was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 193 K until use. The aliquots of protein solution were defrosted and centrifuged to remove the precipitate, and the sample monodispersity was verified with dynamic light scattering. The screening of crystallization conditions was performed with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 295 K by mixing 1 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution. The reservoirs contained 2-fold diluted Crystal Screen and Crystal Screen 2 (Hampton Research) solutions with the addition of 2 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, pH 7.5. Needle-shaped crystal clusters appeared in the ninth condition of the Crystal Screen kit containing 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 15% (w/v) PEG 4000. Optimization of the condition was performed with variation of the PEG 4000 concentration and an Additive Screen kit (Hampton Research). The diffraction quality elongated plate crystals that began growing in 2–3 weeks were obtained at 295 K in 100 mm ammonium acetate, 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 10–10.4% (w/v) PEG 4000, 2 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride, and 50 mm guanidine HCl. For diffraction data collection, the crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 10% (w/v) PEK 4000, and 15% (v/v) PEG 200) for a few seconds, scooped in a nylon fiber loop, and flash-cooled in a dry nitrogen stream at 100 K. Preliminary characterizations of crystal were performed on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV imaging plate using Osmic VariMaxTM HR mirror-focused CuKα radiation from a Rigaku FR-E rotating anode operated at 45 kV and 45 mA. Complete diffraction data sets were collected using synchrotron x-rays on the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon source Beamline 24ID-E with the Area Detector Systems Corporation Quantum 315 detector. All intensity data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL-2000 program package (39.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The crystals belong to monoclinic space group P21 and diffract up to 2.5 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit contains four independent p180C-p70 molecules with a solvent content of 53.48%.

The extreme C-terminal region of p180 (residues 1445–1462) that interacts with DNA primase (45.Kilkenny M.L. De Piccoli G. Perera R.L. Labib K. Pellegrini L.

The density was absent for the N-terminal residues 1–150 of p70 in molecule 2 and residues 1–156 in other three molecules, for the loop region 203–206 of p70 in molecules 2 and 4 and for the residues 487–491 in all four molecules of p70. The human p180C-p70 complex adopts a slab-like structure with overall dimensions of 85 Å × 75 Å × 35 Å (Fig. 1). It is similar to the yeast CTD-B subunit complex (27.Klinge S. Núñez-Ramírez R.

Zn1 contains two antiparallel β strands, β1 and β2, that together with the β1β2 loop hold the first two zinc-coordinating cysteines, Cys-1283 and Cys-1286. The rest of Zn1 is a coil that continues with a short 310 helix. The position of Zn1 is well anchored by a number of hydrophobic interactions with helices α2 to α5. The structure of Zn1 in the human complex is different than in the yeast complex (Fig. 2B). Instead of folding as an extended coil and a 310 helix, the corresponding sequences in the yeast complex are folded as an antiparallel β sheet with three strands. The majority of Zn1 hydrophobic interactions formed between the extended coil and the helices α4 and α5 in the human complex are substituted by interactions of Zn1 with an extended loop that is inserted between helices α4 and α5 in the yeast complex. The Zn2 module contains a small antiparallel β sheet with strands β3, β4, and β5. The α2 and α3 helices together with the Zn2 module are well superimposed with the corresponding region of the yeast complex (rmsd is 0.82 Å for 62 superimposed α carbons) (Fig. 2A). The relatively small difference in the overall shape of human Zn2 compared with Zn2 in yeast is caused by a four-residue insertion between β4 and the third zinc-coordinating cysteine (Cys-1371), as well as by deletion of two residues prior to and one residue insertion after the fourth zinc-coordinating cysteine (Cys-1374) (Fig. 3A). These results coincide with previous sequence analysis of CTDs in eukaryotes showing that Zn2 modules exhibit higher amino acid sequence conservation than Zn1 (17.Tahirov T.H. Makarova K.S.

https://openalex.org/W2737707294,"Climate conditions tend to differ along an altitudinal gradient, resulting in some species groups' patterns of lower species richness with increasing altitude. While this pattern is well understood for tropical mountains, studies investigating possible determinants of variation in beta-diversity at its different altitudes are scarce. We sampled bee and wasp communities (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) along an altitudinal gradient (1,000-2,000 m.a.s.l.) in a tropical mountainous region of Brazil. Trap nests and Moericke traps were established at six sampling points, with 200 m difference in altitude between each point. We obtained average climate data (1970-2000) from Worldclim v2 for altitudes at each sampling site. Nest traps captured 17 bee and wasp species from six families, and Moericke traps captured 124 morphospecies from 13 families. We found a negative correlation between altitude and species richness and abundance. Temperature, precipitation, water vapor pressure, and wind speed influenced species richness and abundance, and were correlated with altitude. β-diversity was primarily determined by species turnover as opposed to nestedness, and Aculeate community similarity was higher for more similar altitudinal ranges. Moericke traps seem to be more efficient for altitudinal surveys compared to nest traps. We found high occurrence of singleton and doubleton species at all altitudes, highlighting the need for long-term studies to efficiently assess hymenopteran diversity in these environments."
https://openalex.org/W2736995548,"Historically, dehumanization has enabled members of advantaged groups to ‘morally disengage’ from disadvantaged group suffering, thereby facilitating acts of intergroup aggression such as colonization, slavery and genocide. But is blatant dehumanization exclusive to those at the top ‘looking down’, or might disadvantaged groups similarly dehumanize those who dominate them? We examined this question in the context of intergroup warfare in which the disadvantaged group shoulders a disproportionate share of casualties and may be especially likely to question the humanity of the advantaged group. Specifically, we assessed blatant dehumanization in the context of stark asymmetric conflict between Israelis (Study 1; N = 521) and Palestinians (Study 2; N = 354) during the 2014 Gaza war. We observed that (a) community samples of Israelis and Palestinians expressed extreme (and comparable) levels of blatant dehumanization, (b) blatant dehumanization was uniquely associated with outcomes related to outgroup hostility for both groups, even after accounting for political ideologies known to strongly predict outgroup aggression, and (c) the strength of association between blatant dehumanization and outcomes was similar across both groups. This study illuminates the striking potency and symmetry of blatant dehumanization among those on both sides of an active asymmetric conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2737043043,"Disentangling the role of competition in regulating the distribution of sympatric species can be difficult because species can have different habitat preferences or time use that introduce non-random patterns that are not related to interspecific interactions. We adopted a multi-step approach to systematically incorporate habitat preferences while investigating the co-occurrence of two presumed competitors, morphologically similar, and closely related ground-dwelling birds: the brown tinamou (Crypturellus obsoletus) and the tataupa tinamou (C. tataupa). First, we used single-species occupancy models to identify the main landscape characteristics affecting site occupancy, while accounting for detection probability. We then used these factors to control for the effect of habitat while investigating species co-occurrence. In addition, we investigated species present-time partitioning by measuring the degree of overlap in their activity time. Both species were strictly diurnal and their activity time highly overlapped (i.e., the species are not present-time partitioning). The distribution of the two species varied across the landscape, and they seemed to occupy opposite portions of the study area, but co-occurrence models and species interaction factors suggested that the tinamous have independent occupancy and detection. In addition, co-occurrence models that accounted for habitat performed better than models without habitat covariates. The observed co-occurrence pattern is more likely related to habitat preferences, wherein species segregated by elevation. These results provide evidence that habitat characteristics can play a bigger role than interspecific interactions in regulating co-existence of some species. Therefore, exploring habitat preferences while analyzing co-occurrence patterns is essential, in addition to being a feasible approach to achieve more accurate estimation of parameters reflecting species interactions. Occupancy models can be a valuable tool in such modeling."

We describe maternal metabolic risk and inflammation by maternal weight status, and evaluate the association of metabolic and inflammatory markers with birthweight in a group of pregnant Mexican women.This study derived from a prospective cohort of healthy pregnant women <14 weeks of gestation, receiving prenatal care at National Institute of Perinatology (Mexico, 2009-2013). Metabolic and inflammatory markers were measured in maternal serum in all three pregnancy trimesters (1st: 11.42±1.7; 2nd: 21.06±2.4; 3rd: 32.74±2.3 weeks). Pregestational weight was self-reported, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Gestational weight gain was evaluated in the third trimester. Newborn´s weight was measured at birth. We carried out correlations, general mixed linear model and regression analyses, based on pregestational weight (self-reported), body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain (evaluated in the third trimester) and newborn weight (measured at birth).Of the 177 women included in the study (mean age = 26.93±8.49), thirty-eight percent (n = 67) were overweight or had obesity, and 32.8% (n = 58) showed excessive gestational weight gain. We found insulin, lipids (including total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides-TG), leptin and interleukin 1b (IL-1b) all increased significantly (p<0.05) during pregnancy. Pregestational maternal weight status altered longitudinal concentrations of insulin, leptin, adiponectin, TG and C reactive protein. Excessive gestational weight gain was associated with higher maternal insulin in the third trimester (p<0.05). Early pregnancy leptin and TNFα were determinants of birthweight in women with normal weight, but not in overweight or obese women.Maternal weight status affected the concentrations of insulin, leptin, adiponectin, triglycerides and C reactive protein throughout pregnancy. The role of early leptin and TNFα in fetal growth need further study given the association was only observed in normal weight women. This study presents data distribution of metabolic and inflammatory markers of normal weight and overweight/obese women that did not develop GDM, preeclampsia nor macrosomia."

This reaction is the first step in the biosynthesis of the quinaldic acid moiety of the thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton, which exhibits potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens. TsrM is a member of the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily of enzymes, but it does not catalyze the formation of 5′-deoxyadenosin-5′-yl or any other SAM-derived radical. In addition to a [4Fe–4S] cluster, TsrM contains a cobalamin cofactor that serves as an intermediate methyl carrier in its reaction. However, how this cofactor donates a methyl moiety to the Trp substrate is unknown. Here, we showed that the unmodified N1 position of Trp is important for turnover and that 1-thia-Trp and 1-oxa-Trp serve as competitive inhibitors. We also showed that β-cyclopropyl-Trp undergoes C2 methylation in the absence of cyclopropyl ring opening, disfavoring mechanisms that involve unpaired electron density at C3 of the indole ring. Moreover, we showed that all other indole-substituted analogs of Trp undergo methylation at varying but measurable rates and that the analog 7-aza-Trp, which is expected to temper the nucleophilicity of C2 in Trp, is a very poor substrate. Last, no formation of cob(II)alamin or substrate radicals was observed during the reaction with Trp or any molecule within a tested panel of Trp analogs. In summary, our results are most consistent with a mechanism that involves two polar nucleophilic displacements, the second of which requires deprotonation of the indole nitrogen in Trp during its attack on methylcobalamin.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of anemia on STEMI patients.From January 2005 to December 2014, 1751 patients experienced STEMI checked serum hemoglobin initially before any administration of fluids or IV medications. 1751 patients then received primary percutaneous intervention immediately. A total of 1388 patients were enrolled in the non-anemia group because their serum hemoglobin level was more than 13 g/L in males, and 12 g/L in females. A total of 363 patients were enrolled in the anemia group because their serum hemoglobin level was less than 13 g/L in males, and 12 g/L in females. Higher incidences of major adverse cerebral cardiac events (22.9% vs. 33.8%; p<0.001) were also noted in the anemia group, and these were related to higher incidence of cardiovascular mortality (6.5% vs. 20.4%; p<0.001). A higher incidence of all-cause mortality (8.6% vs. 27.7%; p<0.001) was also noted in the anemia group.

https://openalex.org/W2741502592,"Sodium pumping rhodopsins (NaRs) are a unique member of the microbial-type I rhodopsin family which actively transport Na+ and H+ depending on ionic condition. In this study, we surveyed 12 different NaRs from various sources of eubacteria for their electrophysiological as well as spectroscopic properties. In mammalian cells several of these NaRs exhibited a Na+ based pump photocurrent and four interesting candidates were chosen for further characterization. Voltage dependent photocurrent amplitudes revealed a membrane potential-sensitive turnover rate, indicating the presence of an electrically-charged intermediate(s) in the photocycle reaction. The NaR from Salinarimonas rosea DSM21201 exhibited a red-shifted absorption spectrum, and slower kinetics compared to the first described sodium pump, KR2. Although the ratio of Na+ to H+ ion transport varied among the NaRs we tested, the NaRs from Flagellimonas sp_DIK and Nonlabens sp_YIK_SED-11 showed significantly higher Na+ selectivity when compared to KR2. All four further investigated NaRs showed a functional expression in dissociated hippocampal neuron culture and hyperpolarizing activity upon light-stimulation. Additionally, all four NaRs allowed optical inhibition of electrically-evoked neuronal spiking. Although efficiency of silencing was 3-5 times lower than silencing with the enhanced version of the proton pump AR3 from Halorubrum sodomense, our data outlines a new approach for hyperpolarization of excitable cells without affecting the intracellular and extracellular proton environment."
https://openalex.org/W2739426285,"The visual photopigment rhodopsin (Rh) is a prototypical G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) responsible for initiation of the phototransduction cascade in rod photoreceptors. Similar to other GPCRs, Rh can form dimers or even higher oligomers and tends to have a supramolecular organization that is likely important in the dim light response. Rh also exhibits high affinity for lipid rafts (i.e. raftophilicity) upon light-dependent binding with the cognate G protein transducin (Gt), suggesting the presence of lipid raft-like domains in the retinal disk membrane and their importance in phototransduction. However, the relationship between Rh oligomerization and lipid rafts in the disk membrane remains to be explored. Given previous findings that Gt binds to dimeric Rh and that Rh is posttranslationally modified with two highly raftophilic palmitoyl moieties, we hypothesized that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Here, using biochemical assays, we found that Rh*–Gt complexes in the detergent-resistant membrane are partially resistant to cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin and that the Rh-to-Gt stoichiometry in this methyl-β-cyclodextrin–resistant complex is 2:1. Next, we found that IgG-mediated Rh–Rh cross-linking renders Rh highly raftophilic, supporting the premise that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Rh depalmitoylation via reduction of thioester linkages blocked the translocation of IgG–cross-linked Rh to the detergent-resistant membrane, highlighting that the two palmitoyl moieties are important for the dimerization-dependent raftophilicity of Rh. These results indicate that palmitoylated GPCRs such as Rh can acquire raftophilicity upon G protein–stabilized dimerization and thereby organize receptor-cluster rafts by recruiting raftophilic lipids. The visual photopigment rhodopsin (Rh) is a prototypical G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) responsible for initiation of the phototransduction cascade in rod photoreceptors. Similar to other GPCRs, Rh can form dimers or even higher oligomers and tends to have a supramolecular organization that is likely important in the dim light response. Rh also exhibits high affinity for lipid rafts (i.e. raftophilicity) upon light-dependent binding with the cognate G protein transducin (Gt), suggesting the presence of lipid raft-like domains in the retinal disk membrane and their importance in phototransduction. However, the relationship between Rh oligomerization and lipid rafts in the disk membrane remains to be explored. Given previous findings that Gt binds to dimeric Rh and that Rh is posttranslationally modified with two highly raftophilic palmitoyl moieties, we hypothesized that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization. Here, using biochemical assays, we found that Rh*–Gt complexes in the detergent-resistant membrane are partially resistant to cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin and that the Rh-to-Gt stoichiometry in this methyl-β-cyclodextrin–resistant complex is 2:1. Next, we found that IgG-mediated Rh–Rh cross-linking renders Rh highly raftophilic, supporting the premise that Rh becomes raftophilic upon dimerization.

https://openalex.org/W2739927634,"NASA's periodic selection of astronauts is a highly selective process accepting applications from the general population, wherein the mechanics of selection are not made public. This research was an effort to determine if biases (specifically age) exist in the process and, if so, at which points they might manifest. Two sets of analyses were conducted. The first utilized data requested via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) on NASA astronaut applicants for the 2009 and 2013 selection years. Using a series of multinomial and logistic regressions, the data were analyzed to uncover whether age of the applicants linearly or nonlinearly affected their likelihood of receiving an invitation, as well as their likelihood of being selected into the astronaut program. The second used public data on age at selection and age at other career milestones for every astronaut selected from 1959 to 2013 to analyze trends in age over time using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression and Pearson's correlation. The results for the FOIA data revealed a nonlinear relationship between age and receiving an interview, as well as age and selection into the astronaut program, but the most striking observation was the loss of age diversity at each stage of selection. Applicants younger or older than approximately 40 years were significantly less likely to receive invitations for interviews and were significantly less likely to be selected as an astronaut. Analysis of the public-source data for all selections since the beginning of the astronaut program revealed significant age trends over time including a gradual increase in selectee age and decreased tenure at NASA after last flight, with average age at retirement steady over the entire history of the astronaut program at approximately 48 years."
https://openalex.org/W2737763054,"Background Hand and face vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is an evolving and challenging field with great opportunities. During VCA, massive surgical damage is inflicted on both donor and recipient tissues, which may contribute to the high VCA rejection rates. To segregate between the damage-induced and rejection phase of post-VCA responses, we compared responses occurring up to 5 days following syngeneic versus allogeneic vascularized groin flap transplantations, culminating in transplant acceptance or rejection, respectively. Methods The immune response elicited upon transplantation of a syngeneic versus allogeneic vascularized groin flap was compared at Post-operative days 2 or 5 by histology, immunohistochemistry and by broad-scope gene and protein analyses using quantitative real-time PCR and Multiplex respectively. Results Immune cell infiltration began at the donor-recipient interface and paralleled expression of a large group of wound healing-associated genes in both allografts and syngrafts. By day 5 post-transplantation, cell infiltration spread over the entire allograft but remained confined to the wound site in the syngraft. This shift correlated with upregulation of IL-18, INFg, CXCL9, 10 and 11, CCL2, CCL5, CX3CL1 and IL-10 in the allograft only, suggesting their role in the induction of the anti-alloantigen adaptive immune response. Conclusions High resemblance between the cues governing VCA and solid organ rejection was observed. Despite this high resemblance we describe also, for the first time, a damage induced inflammatory component in VCA rejection as immune cell infiltration into the graft initiated at the surgical damage site spreading to the entire allograft only at late stage rejection. We speculate that the highly inflammatory setting created by the unique surgical damage during VCA may enhance acute allograft rejection."
https://openalex.org/W2738124505,"For various experimental applications, microbial cultures at defined, constant densities are highly advantageous over simple batch cultures. Due to high costs, however, devices for continuous culture at freely defined densities still experience limited use. We have developed a small-scale turbidostat for research purposes, which is manufactured from inexpensive components and 3D printed parts. A high degree of spatial system integration and a graphical user interface provide user-friendly operability. The used optical density feedback control allows for constant continuous culture at a wide range of densities and offers to vary culture volume and dilution rates without additional parametrization. Further, a recursive algorithm for on-line growth rate estimation has been implemented. The employed Kalman filtering approach based on a very general state model retains the flexibility of the used control type and can be easily adapted to other bioreactor designs. Within several minutes it can converge to robust, accurate growth rate estimates. This is particularly useful for directed evolution experiments or studies on metabolic challenges, as it allows direct monitoring of the population fitness."
https://openalex.org/W2741727249,"Background Acquired drug resistance to the chemotherapeutic drug irinotecan (the active metabolite of which is SN-38) is one of the significant obstacles in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). The molecular mechanism or targets mediating irinotecan resistance are still unclear. It is urgent to find the irinotecan response biomarkers to improve CRC patients’ therapy. Methods Genetic Omnibus Database GSE42387 which contained the gene expression profiles of parental and irinotecan-resistant HCT-116 cell lines was used. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between parental and irinotecan-resistant cells, protein-protein interactions (PPIs), gene ontologies (GOs) and pathway analysis were performed to identify the overall biological changes. The most common DEGs in the PPIs, GOs and pathways were identified and were validated clinically by their ability to predict overall survival and disease free survival. The gene-gene expression correlation and gene-resistance correlation was also evaluated in CRC patients using The Cancer Genomic Atlas data (TCGA). Results The 135 DEGs were identified of which 36 were upregulated and 99 were down regulated. After mapping the PPI networks, the GOs and the pathways, nine genes (GNAS, PRKACB, MECOM, PLA2G4C, BMP6, BDNF, DLG4, FGF2 and FGF9) were found to be commonly enriched. Signal transduction was the most significant GO and MAPK pathway was the most significant pathway. The five genes (FGF2, FGF9, PRKACB, MECOM and PLA2G4C) in the MAPK pathway were all contained in the signal transduction and the levels of those genes were upregulated. The FGF2, FGF9 and MECOM expression were highly associated with CRC patients’ survival rate but not PRKACB and PLA2G4C. In addition, FGF9 was also associated with irinotecan resistance and poor disease free survival. FGF2, FGF9 and PRKACB were positively correlated with each other while MECOM correlated positively with FGF9 and PLA2G4C, and correlated negatively with FGF2 and PRKACB after doing gene-gene expression correlation. Conclusion Targeting the MAPK signal transduction pathway through the targeting of the FGF2, FGF9, MECOM, PLA2G4C and PRKACB might increase tumor responsiveness to irinotecan treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2739908890,"Clinical evaluation of scapular dyskinesis (SD) aims to identify abnormal scapulothoracic movement, underlying causal factors, and the potential relationship with shoulder symptoms. The literature proposes different methods of dynamic clinical evaluation of SD, but improved reliability and agreement values are needed. The present study aimed to evaluate the intrarater and interrater agreement and reliability of three SD classifications: 1) 4-type classification, 2) Yes/No classification, and 3) scapular dyskinesis test (SDT). Seventy-five young athletes, including 45 men and 30 women, were evaluated. Raters evaluated the SD based on the three methods during one series of 8–10 cycles (at least eight and maximum of ten) of forward flexion and abduction with an external load under the observation of two raters trained to diagnose SD. The evaluation protocol was repeated after 3 h for intrarater analysis. The agreement percentage was calculated by dividing the observed agreement by the total number of observations. Reliability was calculated using Cohen Kappa coefficient, with a 95% confidence interval (CI), defined by Kappa coefficient ±1.96 multiplied by the measurement standard error. The interrater analyses showed an agreement percentage between 80% and 95.9% and an almost perfect reliability (k>0.81) for the three classification methods in all the test conditions, except the 4-type and SDT classification methods, which had substantial reliability (k<0.80) in shoulder abduction. Intrarater analyses showed agreement percentages between 80.7% and 89.3% and substantial reliability (0.67 to 0.81) for both raters in the three classifications. CIs ranged from moderate to almost perfect categories. This indicates that the three SD classification methods investigated in this study showed high reliability values for both intrarater and interrater evaluation throughout a protocol that provided SD evaluation training of raters and included several repetitions of arm movements with external load during a live assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2739914115,"The DNA damage checkpoint is activated in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We had previously shown that chromatin assembly mediated by the histone chaperone Asf1 triggers inactivation of the DNA damage checkpoint in yeast after DSB repair, also called checkpoint recovery. Here we show that chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) also contributes to chromatin reassembly after DSB repair, explaining its role in checkpoint recovery. Towards understanding how chromatin assembly promotes checkpoint recovery, we find persistent presence of the damage sensors Ddc1 and Ddc2 after DSB repair in asf1 mutants. The genes encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex Rtt101Mms1 are epistatic to ASF1 for survival following induction of a DSB, and Rtt101Mms1 are required for checkpoint recovery after DSB repair but not for chromatin assembly. By contrast, the Mms22 substrate adaptor that is degraded by Rtt101Mms1 is required for DSB repair per se. Deletion of MMS22 blocks loading of Rad51 at the DSB, while deletion of ASF1 or RTT101 leads to persistent Rad51 loading. We propose that checkpoint recovery is promoted by Rtt101Mms1-mediated ubiquitylation of Mms22 in order to halt Mms22-dependent loading of Rad51 onto double-stranded DNA after DSB repair, in concert with the chromatin assembly-mediated displacement of Rad51 and checkpoint sensors from the site of repair."
https://openalex.org/W2740168435,"There is an urgent need to develop new drug treatment strategies to control the global spread of drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). The ß-lactam class of antibiotics is among the safest and most widely prescribed antibiotics, but they are not effective against M. tuberculosis due to intrinsic resistance. This study shows that 2-aminoimidazole (2-AI)-based small molecules potentiate ß-lactam antibiotics against M. tuberculosis. Active 2-AI compounds significantly reduced the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of ß-lactams by increasing M. tuberculosis cell envelope permeability and decreasing protein secretion including ß-lactamase. Metabolic labeling and transcriptional profiling experiments revealed that 2-AI compounds impair mycolic acid biosynthesis, export and linkage to the mycobacterial envelope, counteracting an important defense mechanism reducing permeability to external agents. Additionally, other important constituents of the M. tuberculosis outer membrane including sulfolipid-1 and polyacyltrehalose were also less abundant in 2-AI treated bacilli. As a consequence of 2-AI treatment, M. tuberculosis displayed increased sensitivity to SDS, increased permeability to nucleic acid staining dyes, and rapid binding of cell wall targeting antibiotics. Transcriptional profiling analysis further confirmed that 2-AI induces transcriptional regulators associated with cell envelope stress. 2-AI based small molecules potentiate the antimicrobial activity of ß-lactams by a mechanism that is distinct from specific inhibitors of ß-lactamase activity and therefore may have value as an adjunctive anti-TB treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2738502674,"The respiratory tract and lungs are subject to diverse pathologies with wide-ranging implications for both human and animal welfare. The development and detailed characterization of cell culture models for studying such forms of disease is of critical importance. In recent years the use of air-liquid interface (ALI)-cultured airway epithelial cells has increased markedly, as this method of culture results in the formation of a highly representative, organotypic in vitro model system. In this study we have expanded on previous knowledge of differentiated ovine tracheal epithelial cells by analysing the progression of differentiation over an extensive time course at an ALI. We observed a pseudo-stratified epithelium with ciliation and a concurrent increase in cell layer thickness from 9 days post-ALI with ciliation approaching a maximum level at day 24. A similar pattern was observed with respect to mucus production with intensely stained PAS-positive cells appearing at day 12. Ultrastructural analysis by SEM confirmed the presence of both ciliated cells and mucus globules on the epithelial surface within this time-frame. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) peaked at 1049 Ω × cm2 as the cell layer became confluent, followed by a subsequent reduction as differentiation proceeded and stabilization at ~200 Ω × cm2. Importantly, little deterioration or de-differentiation was observed over the 45 day time-course indicating that the model is suitable for long-term experiments."

To thoroughly characterize this model, and to better understand how closely it recapitulates human disease, we performed a high resolution longitudinal analysis of renal disease progression in ZSF1 rats spanning from early disease to end stage renal disease. Analyses included metabolic endpoints, renal histology and ultrastructure, evaluation of a urinary biomarker of fibrosis, and transcriptome analysis of glomerular-enriched tissue over the course of disease.

https://openalex.org/W2741834610,"A one-step multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) based on TaqMan probes was developed for the simultaneous detection of Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), Apple stem pitting virus (ASPV) and Apple stem grooving virus (ASGV) in total RNA of pome trees extracted with a CTAB method. The sensitivity of the method was established using in vitro synthesized viral transcripts serially diluted in RNA from healthy, virus-tested (negative) pome trees. The three viruses were simultaneously detected up to a 10−4 dilution of total RNA from a naturally triple-infected apple tree prepared in total RNA of healthy apple tissue. The newly developed RT-qPCR assay was at least one hundred times more sensitive than conventional single RT-PCRs. The assay was validated with 36 field samples for which nine triple and 11 double infections were detected. All viruses were detected simultaneously in composite samples at least up to the ratio of 1:150 triple-infected to healthy pear tissue, suggesting the assay has the capacity to examine rapidly a large number of samples in pome tree certification programs and surveys for virus presence."
https://openalex.org/W2742107672,"A solution for the nuclear waste problem is the key challenge for an extensive use of nuclear reactors as a major carbon free, sustainable, and applied highly reliable energy source. Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) promises a solution for improved waste management. Current strategies rely on systems designed in the 60's for the massive production of plutonium. We propose an innovative strategic development plan based on invention and innovation described with the concept of developments in s-curves identifying the current boundary conditions, and the evolvable objectives. This leads to the ultimate, universal vision for energy production characterized by minimal use of resources and production of waste, while being economically affordable and safe, secure and reliable in operation. This vision is transformed into a mission for a disruptive development of the future nuclear energy system operated by burning of existing spent nuclear fuel (SNF) without prior reprocessing. This highly innovative approach fulfils the sustainability goals and creates new options for P&T. A proof on the feasibility from neutronic point of view is given demonstrating sufficient breeding of fissile material from the inserted SNF. The system does neither require new resources nor produce additional waste, thus it provides a highly sustainable option for a future nuclear system fulfilling the requests of P&T as side effect. In addition, this nuclear system provides enhanced resistance against misuse of Pu and a significantly reduced fuel cycle. However, the new system requires a demand driven rethinking of the separation process to be efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2739769699,"Vitamin D deficiency is a common health problem with consequences not limited to bone and calcium hemostasis. Low levels have also been linked to tuberculosis and other respiratory infections as well as autoimmune diseases. We have previously shown that supplementation with vitamin D can induce the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin during ex vivo infection of human urinary bladder. In rodents, however, cathelicidin expression is not linked to vitamin D and therefore this vitamin D-related effect fighting bacterial invasion is not relevant. To determine if vitamin D had further protective mechanisms during urinary tract infections, we therefore used a mouse model. In vitamin D-deficient mice, we detected more intracellular bacterial communities in the urinary bladder, higher degree of bacterial spread to the upper urinary tract and a skewed cytokine response. Furthermore, we show that the vitamin D receptor was upregulated in the urinary bladder and translocated into the cell nucleus after E. coli infection. This study supports a more general role for vitamin D as a local immune response mediator in the urinary tract."

About 2000 children in China, who were on average aged 6 years, were assessed for both informal math (e.g., basic number concepts such as counting objects) and formal math (calculations including addition and subtraction) skills, language abilities and nonverbal intelligence.Correlation analysis showed that language abilities were more strongly associated with informal than formal math skills, and regression analyses revealed that children's language abilities could uniquely predict both informal and formal math skills with age, gender, and nonverbal intelligence controlled. Mediation analyses demonstrated that the relationship between children's language abilities and formal math skills was partially mediated by informal math skills.The current findings indicate 1) Children's language abilities are of strong predictive values for both informal and formal math skills; 2) Language abilities impacts formal math skills partially through the mediation of informal math skills."

An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid linear ion trap triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQLIT-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the estimation of quantitative variation of eight major bioactive phenolics in the rhizomes (150 samples) of four species of this herb, Bergenia (B. ciliata, B. ligulata, B. purpurascens and B. stracheyi). Chromatographic separation was obtained on a Waters ACQUITY UPLCTM BEH (ethylene bridged hybrid) C18 column with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile under a gradient elution manner. A hybrid linear ion trap triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in negative electrospray ionization mode with multiple reactions monitoring for detection and quantification of the eight compounds. The validated method demonstrated good linearity (r2 ≥ 0.9991), precision (RSD ≤ 1.87%) and accuracy (95.16-102.11%, RSD ≤ 1.83%) for all reference analytes. The quantitative results revealed that B. ligulata contains the highest amount of the major active marker-bergenin. The results also suggest that sensitive UHPLC-QqQLIT-MS/MS method, a sensitive, accurate and convenient one, could be helpful in identification of potential accession(s), rapid quality control and establishing authenticity of Bergenia species as raw material for pharmaceutical industries."
https://openalex.org/W2741812905,"Backgrounds Malaria is a leading cause of imported febrile illnesses in pediatric travelers, but few studies have addressed severe imported pediatric malaria. We aimed to determine the risk factors and the features of imported pediatric severe malaria. Methods We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study using the French National Reference Center for Imported Malaria database, in children aged 0–15 years who were hospitalized with a falciparum malaria from January 1st 1996 to December 31th 2005. Uncomplicated and severe cases of falciparum malaria were compared to identify risk factors for severe cases. In the hospitals that reported more than five severe cases during the study period, we evaluated severe cases for prognostic factors and assessed the accuracy WHO criteria for predicting severity. Given the rarity of deaths, adverse outcomes were defined as requiring major therapeutic procedures (MTPs)—e.g., sedation, mechanical ventilation, nasal oxygen therapy, blood transfusions, hemodialysis, fluid resuscitation—or pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. Results Of 4150 pediatric malaria cases included in the study, 3299 were uncomplicated and 851 (20.5%) were severe. Only one death was recorded during this period. Predictors for severe falciparum malaria were: age <2 years (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 2.5–4.0, p <0.0001) and a travel in the Sahelian region (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.3–2.0, p = 0.0001). Of 422 severe malaria cases, a stay in a Sahelian region, lack of chemoprophylaxis, age <2 years or thrombocytopenia <100 x 10^3/mm^3 predicted adverse outcomes. Except for the hyperparasitemia threshold of 4%, the main WHO 2000 criteria for severe malaria reliably predicted adverse outcomes. In our study, the threshold of parasitemia most predictive of a poor outcome was 8%. Conclusion In imported pediatric malaria, children younger than 2 years deserve particular attention. The main WHO 2000 criteria for severity are accurate, except for the threshold of hyperparasitemia, which should be revised."
https://openalex.org/W2742077344,"Heightened inflammation, including expression of COX-2, is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is reduced in COPD-derived lung fibroblasts. The AhR also suppresses COX-2 in response to cigarette smoke, the main risk factor for COPD, by destabilizing the Cox-2 transcript by mechanisms that may involve the regulation of microRNA (miRNA). Whether reduced AhR expression is responsible for heightened COX-2 in COPD is not known. Here, we investigated the expression of COX-2 as well as the expression of miR-146a, a miRNA known to regulate COX-2 levels, in primary lung fibroblasts derived from non-smokers (Normal) and smokers (At Risk) with and without COPD. To confirm the involvement of the AhR, AhR knock-down via siRNA in Normal lung fibroblasts and MLE-12 cells was employed as were A549-AhRko cells. Basal expression of COX-2 protein was higher in COPD lung fibroblasts compared to Normal or Smoker fibroblasts but there was no difference in Cox-2 mRNA. Knockdown of AhR in lung structural cells increased COX-2 protein by stabilizing the Cox-2 transcript. There was less induction of miR-146a in COPD-derived lung fibroblasts but this was not due to the AhR. Instead, we found that RelB, an NF-κB protein, was required for transcriptional induction of both Cox-2 and miR-146a. Therefore, we conclude that the AhR controls COX-2 protein via mRNA stability by a mechanism independent of miR-146a. Low levels of the AhR may therefore contribute to the heightened inflammation common in COPD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2741571156,"Determinants of nonfunctional arteriovenous (AV) access, including timing of AV access creation, have not been sufficiently described. We studied 29 945 patients who had predialysis AV access placement and were included in the French REIN registry from 2005 through 2013. AV access was considered nonfunctional when dialysis began with a catheter. We estimated crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of nonfunctional versus functional AV access associated with case-mix, facility characteristics, and timing of AV access creation. Analyses were stratified by dialysis start condition (planned or as an emergency) and comorbidity profile. Overall, 18% patients had nonfunctional AV access at hemodialysis initiation. In the group with planned dialysis start, female gender (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.56), diabetes (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.15-1.44), and a higher number of cardiovascular comorbidities (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.49, and 1.31, 1.05-1.64, for 3 and >3 cardiovascular comorbidities versus none, respectively) were independent predictors of nonfunctional AV access. A higher percentage of AV access creation at the region level was associated with a lower rate of nonfunctional AV access (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.98-0.99 per 1% increase). The odds of nonfunctional AV access decreased as time from creation to hemodialysis initiation increased up to 3 months in nondiabetic patients with fewer than 2 cardiovascular comorbidities and 6 months in patients with diabetes or 2 or more such comorbidities. In conclusion, both patient characteristics and clinical practices may play a role in successful AV access use at hemodialysis initiation. Adjusting the timing of AV access creation to patients' comorbidity profiles may improve functional AV access rates."
https://openalex.org/W2742099471,"Objectives Extra-thoracic tumors send out pilot cells that attach to the pulmonary endothelium. We hypothesized that this could alter regional lung mechanics (tissue stiffening or accumulation of fluid and inflammatory cells) through interactions with host cells. We explored this with serial inspiratory computed tomography (CT) and image matching to assess regional changes in lung expansion. Materials and methods We retrospectively assessed 44 pairs of two serial CT scans on 21 sarcoma patients: 12 without lung metastases and 9 with lung metastases. For each subject, two or more serial inspiratory clinically-derived CT scans were retrospectively collected. Two research-derived control groups were included: 7 normal nonsmokers and 12 asymptomatic smokers with two inspiratory scans taken the same day or one year apart respectively. We performed image registration for local-to-local matching scans to baseline, and derived local expansion and density changes at an acinar scale. Welch two sample t test was used for comparison between groups. Statistical significance was determined with a p value < 0.05. Results Lung regions of metastatic sarcoma patients (but not the normal control group) demonstrated an increased proportion of normalized lung expansion between the first and second CT. These hyper-expanded regions were associated with, but not limited to, visible metastatic lung lesions. Compared with the normal control group, the percent of increased normalized hyper-expanded lung in sarcoma subjects was significantly increased (p < 0.05). There was also evidence of increased lung “tissue” volume (non-air components) in the hyper-expanded regions of the cancer subjects relative to non-hyper-expanded regions. “Tissue” volume increase was present in the hyper-expanded regions of metastatic and non-metastatic sarcoma subjects. This putatively could represent regional inflammation related to the presence of tumor pilot cell-host related interactions. Conclusions This new quantitative CT (QCT) method for linking serial acquired inspiratory CT images may provide a diagnostic and prognostic means to objectively characterize regional responses in the lung following oncological treatment and monitoring for lung metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2737040735,"Establishment of apical–basal polarity, through correct targeting of polarity determinants to distinct domains of the plasma membrane, is a fundamental process for the development of functioning epithelial tubules. Here we report that galectin (Gal)-8 regulates apical-basal polarity of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells via apical targeting of 135-kDa glycoprotein (Gp135). Gal-8 interacts with newly synthesized Gp135 in a glycan-dependent manner. Gal-8 knockdown induces aberrant lumens at the lateral domain and mistargeting of Gp135 to this structure, thus disrupting the kidney epithelial polarity of MDCK cells, which organize lumens at the apical surface. The O-glycosylation deletion mutant of Gp135 phenocopies the effect of Gal-8 knockdown, which suggests that Gal-8 is the decoding machinery for the apical sorting signals of Gp135 residing at its O-glycosylation–rich region.

Methods A total of 27 patients with unilateral hearing impairment following mumps were enrolled. The degrees of hearing loss and otolith organ damage were confirmed by audiometric and vestibular evoked myogenic potential [VEMP] tests. All the results were compared and analyzed using Stata 13.0 software for Windows. Results The VEMP thresholds of the affected ears were significantly higher than those of the unaffected ears in both tests (cervical VEMP [cVEMP] test and ocular VEMP [oVEMP] test; p = 0.000 and 0.001, respectively). The mean cVEMP and oVEMP threshold values of the affected ears with hearing impairment for ≤10 years were significantly lower than those of affected ears with hearing impairment for >10 years [p = 0.009 and 0.004, respectively]. Conclusions Deafness resulting from mumps is usually profound and permanent, which indicates severe damage to the cochlea due to the disease. The functions of otolith organs in the vestibular system are also impaired. Over time, the function of the otolith organs or their neural pathway may suffer secondary damage."
https://openalex.org/W2736576268,"Jellyfish blooms cause important ecological and socio-economic problems. Among jellyfish, cubozoans are infamous for their painful, sometimes deadly, stings and are a major public concern in tropical to subtropical areas; however, there is little information about the possible causes of their outbreaks. After a bloom of the cubomedusa Carybdea marsupialis (Carybdeidae) along the coast of Denia (SW Mediterranean, Spain) in 2008 with negative consequences for local tourism, the necessity to understand the ecological restrictions on medusae abundance was evident. Here we use different models (GAM and zero-inflated models) to understand the environmental and human related factors influencing the abundance and distribution of C. marsupialis along the coast of Denia. Selected variables differed among medusae size classes, showing different environmental restriction associated to the developmental stages of the species. Variables implicated with dispersion (e.g. wind and current) affected mostly small and medium size classes. Sea surface temperature, salinity and proxies of primary production (chl a, phosphates, nitrates) were related to the abundances of small and large size classes, highlighting the roles of springtime salinity changes and increased primary production that may promote and maintain high densities of this species. The increased primary (and secondary) production due to anthropogenic impact is implicated as the factor enabling high numbers of C. marsupialis to thrive.

In the adult pituitary, BMPs participate in the control of hormone secretion and cell proliferation, suggesting a potential endocrine/paracrine role for BMPs, but some of the mechanisms are unclear. Here, using a bioactivity test based on embryonic cells (C3H10T1/2) transfected with a BMP-responsive element, we sought to determine whether pituitary cells secrete BMPs or BMP antagonists. Interestingly, we found that pituitary-conditioned medium contains a factor that inhibits action of BMP-2 and -4. Combining surface plasmon resonance and high-resolution mass spectrometry helped pinpoint this factor as thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). Surface plasmon resonance and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that recombinant human TSP-1 can bind BMP-2 and -4 and antagonize their effects on C3H10T1/2 cells. Moreover, TSP-1 inhibited the action of serum BMPs. We also report that the von Willebrand type C domain of TSP-1 is likely responsible for this BMP-2/4-binding activity, an assertion based on sequence similarity that TSP-1 shares with the von Willebrand type C domain of Crossveinless 2 (CV-2), a BMP antagonist and member of the chordin family. In summary, we identified for the first time TSP-1 as a BMP-2/-4 antagonist and presented a structural basis for the physical interaction between TSP-1 and BMP-4. We propose that TSP-1 could regulate bioavailability of BMPs, either produced locally or reaching the pituitary via blood circulation. In conclusion, our findings provide new insights into the involvement of TSP-1 in the BMP-2/-4 mechanisms of action.

BMP signaling occurs through heteromeric receptor complexes composed of type 1 and type 2 transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors. Three type 1 receptors are known to bind BMPs, which include the activin-receptor-like kinase 2 (ALK2), ALK3 (also known as BMPR-IA), and ALK6 (BMPR-IB) (19Kawabata M. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Signal transduction by bone morphogenetic proteins.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 20Miyazono K. Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Divergence and convergence of TGF-β/BMP signaling.J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Similarly, three type 2 receptors possess binding affinity for BMPs, including BMPR-II, activin type IIA receptor (ActR-IIA), and ActR-IIB. The ligand binding induces the trans-phosphorylation of the type 1 receptor by the type 2 receptor. Consequently, the activated BMPR-I phosphorylates intracellular receptor-activated SMADs, SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8, which then interacts with SMAD4 (Co-SMAD). The receptor-activated SMAD–Co-SMAD complex translocates to the nucleus and acts as transcription factors, either activating or repressing gene expression (21Zwijsen A. Verschueren K. Huylebroeck D. New intracellular components of bone morphogenetic protein/SMAD signaling cascades.FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). BMP signaling is modulated by several extra- and intracellular modulators acting at multiple levels. A large number of extracellular antagonists, such as noggin, the chordin family, gremlin, twisted gastrulation protein, and the Dan family (22Vitt U.A. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J.

BMP antagonists: their roles in development and involvement in pathophysiology.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, non-signaling membrane pseudoreceptors or intracellular inhibitory SMADs are also able to block the BMP signaling (25Gazzerro E. Canalis E. Bone morphogenetic proteins and their antagonists.Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2006; 7: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Several BMP mRNAs are present in pituitary. For example, BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, and GDF9 (growth and differentiation factor 9) mRNAs were detected in ewe pituitary (10Faure M.O. Nicol L. Fabre S. Fontaine J. Mohoric N. McNeilly A. Taragnat C. BMP-4 inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone secretion in ewe pituitary.J Endocrinol. 2005; 186: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Sallon C. Faure M.O. Fontaine J. Taragnat C.

Endocrinol. 2010; 207: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ALK3, ALK6, and BMPR-II are found on different cell types including gonadotropes and corticotropes (10Faure M.O. Nicol L. Fabre S. Fontaine J. Mohoric N. McNeilly A. Taragnat C. BMP-4 inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone secretion in ewe pituitary.J Endocrinol. 2005; 186: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These data suggest that pituitary BMPs can exert paracrine/autocrine actions on hormone synthesis and release. Alternatively, BMPs can act as endocrine factors supplied by the blood. Indeed, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-9 were found in bovine serum (27Herrera B. Inman G.J. A rapid and sensitive bioassay for the simultaneous measurement of multiple bone morphogenetic proteins. Identification and quantification of BMP-4, BMP-6 and BMP9 in bovine and human serum.BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential endocrine role for BMPs at pituitary level. In this context the first aim of the present study was to investigate whether pituitary cells produced BMPs and/or BMP inhibitors as well as whether the serum conveys BMPs. In the absence of available antibodies and protein assays for ovine BMPs, a sensitive in vitro bioassay based on mouse C3H-B12 cells was used. These cells are mesenchymal embryonic C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with an expression construct (BRE-Luc) containing a BMP-responsive element fused to firefly luciferase reporter gene (28Logeart-Avramoglou D. Bourguignon M. Oudina K. Ten Dijke P. Petite H. An assay for the determination of biologically active bone morphogenetic proteins using cells transfected with an inhibitor of differentiation promoter-luciferase construct.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 349: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This assay presents the advantage to monitor the bioactivity of the protein and is not isoform-specific. It can also allow to detect factors that inhibit BMP action. Interestingly, we found that pituitary cell-conditioned media exhibited an inhibitory activity for BMP-induced luciferase activity. We then conducted the identification of the putative inhibitory factor combining surface plasmon resonance and high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Last, based on sequence and structure analysis, we provide insights into the molecular basis of interaction between BMP-4 and this inhibitor. First, the BMP effect on the BRE-Luc construct was determined by treating C3H-B12 cells with increasing concentrations of BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, or BMP-7 (0–50 ng/ml) overnight and monitoring changes in the luciferase activity. BMPs stimulated luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). BMP-4 was the most potent inducer of luciferase activity with an ED50 of 1.2 ng/ml and detection threshold of 0.25 ng/ml, whereas BMP-7 was the least potent inducer with a detection threshold of 25 ng/ml. To determine whether CM from ovine pituitary cells exhibited BMP activity, C3H-B12 cells were exposed to CM from cultured pituitary cells, which were treated or not with 10−8 m GnRH for 6 h (CM GnRH 6 h) or with either 10−9 m activin for 48 h (CM activin 48 h). Luciferase activity from C3H-B12 was not modified compared with C3H-B12 cells exposed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM-0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) i.e. non-conditioned media; Fig. 1B). This result suggests that conditioned media exhibits no or low amounts of bioactive BMP whatever the treatment and the incubation period of the pituitary cells. To evaluate the potential presence of BMP inhibitors in CM, we supplemented pituitary cell media conditioned for 48 h with increasing doses of BMP-4 and incubated them with C3H-B12 cells. A dose-dependent increase in the luciferase activity was observed (Fig. 1C, gray spots). However, this increase was impaired relative to that obtained with DMEM, 0.1% BSA supplemented with similar doses of BMP-4 (Fig. 1C, black spots). A dose of 50 ng/ml BMP-4 in CM was necessary to recover full activity of BMP-4 on C3H-B12 cells compared with 5 ng/ml in DMEM, 0.1% BSA (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that an inhibitory activity of BMP action is present in CM. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of BMP action was more elevated in the medium conditioned for 48 h (CM basal 48 h) than for 6 h (CM basal 6 h) (72% of inhibition and 17%, respectively, versus DMEM + BMP-4) (Fig. 1D). As comparison, we analyzed CM basal 48 h from adrenocortical cells cultured in the same conditions as the pituitary cells. The C3H-B12 cell luciferase activity induced by BMP-4 (10 ng/ml) supplemented in adrenal cell CM was similar to that of BMP-4 diluted in DMEM, 0.1% BSA indicating that the CM from adrenal cells did not exhibit a detectable inhibitory activity of BMP action (Fig. 1D, inset). To determine whether FSH regulatory factors, such as GnRH and activin, were capable of modulating the production of the inhibitory activity, CM from pituitary cells treated with these factors in dose and time conditions known to affect FSH secretion were supplemented with 10 ng/ml rhBMP-4 and incubated with C3H-B12 cells overnight. In the presence of BMP-4, CM from pituitary cells treated with GnRH for 6 h (CM GnRH 6 h) impaired the increase in luciferase activity of C3H-B12 cells versus DMEM + BMP-4 (77% inhibition) (p < 0.01) more than did CM from non-treated cells (CM basal 6 h) (17% inhibition) (p > 0.05) (Fig. 1D). This suggests that GnRH increased the CM inhibitory activity on BMP action. When the CM from pituitary cells treated with activin for 48 h (CM activin 48 h) were added with BMP-4, they tended to impair the increase in luciferase activity versus DMEM + BMP-4 more than did CM from non treated cells (CM basal 48 h) (83% of inhibition versus 72%), although the difference was not statistically different (Fig. 1D). The treatment of C3H-B12 cells with pituitary CM, BMP-4, GnRH, or activin did not affect cell proliferation compared with DMEM, 0.1% BSA (Fig. 1E). Moreover, we tested the ability of the pituitary CM to decrease the effect of another BMP, BMP-2. Fig. 1F shows that luciferase activity was impaired when BMP-2 was added to CM conditioned for 48 h compared with the addition in DMEM, similarly to the effect observed with BMP-4. To explore the hypothesis that the CM factor(s) responsible for the inhibition of BMP action can be the BMP-4-binding protein(s), interaction between conditioned media and BMP-4 was analyzed using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore). The injection of CM (1/10 diluted) resulted in binding to high density immobilized rhBMP-4, whereas the injection of DMEM, 0.1% BSA led to a low nonspecific binding signal (Fig. 2). Moreover, the interaction signal was more elevated with media conditioned for 48 h compared with media conditioned for 6 h. To concentrate the binding factor and eliminate small molecules, the CM volumes were 10-fold reduced using high molecular mass polyethylene glycol (PEG) dialysis. The concentrated media exhibited an increased interaction signal compared with crude CM (Fig. 2). Collectively, these results demonstrated that an interaction occurs between pituitary CM and BMP-4. Note that the differences in interaction signal observed between media conditioned for 6 h and 48 h are consistent with the changes observed in the biological effect of the corresponding CM on CH3-B12 cells (Fig. 1D). The CM fraction bound to BMP-4 on CM5 sensorchip was eluted and analyzed by on-line nanoflow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry after tryptic digestion. The only three detectable peptides allowed the identification of the predicted thrombospondin-1 isoform 1 (TSP-1) (Table 1), a 450-kDa secreted homotrimeric protein that regulates a wide range of functions (29Myszka D.G. Improving biosensor analysis.J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). These peptides were not detected when elution was performed after injection of DMEM, 0.1% BSA on CM5 sensorchip instead of conditioned media. These results demonstrated that BMP-4 chip acts as a specific and efficient affinity separation method.Table 1Protein and peptides identified by tandem mass spectrometry in the fraction from CM bound to BMP-4 coated CM5 sensorchipIdentified peptidesProtein descriptionAccession number (nrNCBI)TaxonomyGeneTheoretical molecular weightTGDEWTVDSCTECRPredicted thrombospondin-1gi 426232958Ovis ariesTSP-1129 kDaCENTDPGYNCLPCPPRQVTQSYWDTNPTR Open table in a new tab To confirm the interaction between TSP-1 and BMP-4, surface plasmon resonance analysis was conducted. The injection of rhTSP-1 on low density BMP-4-immobilized CM5 sensorchip led to dose-dependent binding (Fig. 3A). To determine affinity data, we used the method of steady-state analysis. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction was calculated at 10−8 m in two independent experiments. BMP-4 binding to TSP-1 was further assayed using TSP-1-immobilized CM5 sensorchip. As expected, the injection of BMP-4 resulted in a dose-dependent binding signal (Fig. 3B). BMP-2 binding to TSP-1 was also studied on TSP-1-immobilized CM5 sensorchip. Dose-dependent binding signal was observed (Fig. 3C) with a kinetics slightly different from that of BMP-4. The dissociation constants (KD) were: 5.95 × 10−7 m for BMP-4 and 1.26 × 10−7 for BMP-2. Evaluation of the kinetic parameters showed faster association and dissociation rates for BMP-2 (Table 2).Table 2Kinetic parameters of the interaction between BMP-4 and TSP-1 analysed by surface plasmon resonanceInteracting proteinskakdKDRmaxχ2m−1 s−1s−1mRU2BMP4-TSP16.9 × 1040.0375.95 × 10−7421.762.58BMP2-TSP11.23 × 1060.1541.26 × 10−7609.84.52 Open table in a new tab In contrast, no interaction between TSP-1 and activin, chosen as control, was observed (Fig. 3D). To add more experimental data showing the interaction between BMP-4 and TSP-1, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. When BMP-4 and TSP-1 are incubated together, precipitation with anti-BMP-4 antibody co-precipitates TSP-1 as detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3E, fourth lane). In contrast, when the anti-BMP-4 antibody was omitted or replaced by a nonspecific IgG, TSP-1 was not detected (Fig. 3E, second and third lanes, respectively). These observations confirm the interaction between BMP-4 and TSP-1. Furthermore, to assess the biological relevance of the BMP-4 and TSP-1 interaction, we studied the ability of TSP-1 to block BMP-4 or BMP-2 action. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, incubation of TSP-1 with BMP-4 or BMP-2 led to antagonize BMP action as demonstrated in CH3-B12 cell bioassay where rhTSP-1 inhibited the activity of BMP-4 or BMP-2 (2.5 ng/ml, i.e. 10−10 m) on luciferase transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Dose-response curves were fitted using the Hill equation (Fig. 4, E and F). Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were estimated at 11.4 ± 6.3 and 8.5 ± 3.9 nm, respectively, with Hill slope values of 0.36 ± 0.1 and 0.61 ± 0.13. These values are in agreement with a negative cooperative interaction. TSP-1 alone did not affect luciferase transcription (Fig. 4A). As a comparison, noggin, a well-known BMP-2/4-binding protein, inhibited the activity of BMP-4 as well as BMP-2 (2.5 ng/ml, i.e. 10−10 m) (Fig. 4, C and D). When the data were fitted with the Hill equation, estimated IC50 values were 0.023 ± 0.001 and 0.021 ± 0.003 nm, respectively, with Hill slope values of 7.4 ± 0.6 and 6.9 ± 0.8 (Fig. 4, E and F). These values suggest a positive cooperative interaction. To confirm our findings from mass spectrometry identifying TSP-1 as a factor present in pituitary cell CM, the expression of its mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR in cells collected at the time of CM recovery (48 h). Fig. 5A shows the presence of a single PCR product at the expected size for TSP-1 mRNA, i.e. 98 bp, whereas no product was detected when reverse transcriptase was omitted. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of the protein in CM with an apparent Mr of 150 or 450 in reducing or non-reducing conditions, respectively, corresponding to TSP-1 (Fig. 5B). As expected, the level of TSP-1 was increased in CM 48 h compared with CM 6 h. This result is consistent with the increase of the inhibition of BMP-4 action on luciferase activity from B12 cells observed with media from pituitary cells conditioned for 48 h compared with 6 h (Fig. 1D). TSP-1 level also tended to increase in the presence of CM from pituitary cells treated with GnRH for 6 h compared with CM basal 6 h, although the difference was not significant (p < 0.1, Fig. 5B). To validate that a high molecular mass factor like ovine TSP-1 present in pituitary CM is able to bind BMP-4 and inhibit its action, conditioned media were fractionated using 100-kDa cut-off membranes. The presence of TSP-1 in the retentate (CM >100 kDa) but not in the filtrate (CM <100 kDa) was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5D shows that retentate (CM >100 kDa), but not filtrate (CM <100 kDa), bound to BMP-4-immobilized sensorchip. Consistent with this result is the inhibition of BMP-4 (10 ng/ml) action observed with the retentate but not with the filtrate on luciferase transcription in CH3-B12 cells (Fig. 5E). The above data showed that pituitary cells produced TSP-1 and that TSP-1 was able to bind BMPs. We made the hypothesis that pituitary TSP-1 could bind BMPs reaching the pituitary through the blood. We first asked whether ovine serum contains BMPs. To address this question, C3H-B12 cells were exposed to dilutions of serum from adult ewes. Fig. 6A showed that serum induced a dose-dependent increase of luciferase activity in C3H-B12 cells, suggesting that BMP-like activity was present. Serum did not affect cell proliferation or morphology in our assay conditions when diluted ½ or more (data not shown). To test whether the increas"

We aimed to increase knowledge on the mediating role of recovery opportunities (RO) during and after work on future sickness absence from a gender- and age-sensitive perspective. We used data on RO from a Swedish national survey in 2011 and linked these to sickness absence (>14 days) two years later among the general working population (N = 7,649). Mediation of the relationship between gender and sickness absence by exposure to RO was studied through linear regression. We conducted separate analyses for RO during and after work and for three different age groups (16-29; 30-49; 50-64). The sample consisted of 3,563 men and 4,086 women. Sickness absence was higher among the women than among the men (11 days vs 5 days, p<0.001). Men reported statistically significantly more positive on their RO than women. RO during (ß 0.3-1.8) and after work (ß 0.4-0.6) mediated the relationship between gender and sickness absence. Mediation effects existed across age groups, with the strongest effects of RO during work found among the age group between 50 and 64 years of age (attenuation 36%). Our results indicate that gender inequality is also reflected in worse RO among women. This partially explains the increased risk of future sickness absence, particularly among those above 50 years of age. These findings show that RO during work deserve more attention in working life research."

To gain access, most enzymes use nucleotide flipping, whereby the target nucleotide is rotated 180° into the active site. In human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG), the enzyme that initiates base excision repair of alkylated bases, the flipped-out nucleotide is stabilized by intercalation of the side chain of tyrosine 162 that replaces the lesion nucleobase. Previous kinetic studies provided evidence for the formation of a transient complex that precedes the stable flipped-out complex, but it is not clear how this complex differs from nonspecific complexes. We used site-directed mutagenesis and transient-kinetic approaches to investigate the timing of Tyr162 intercalation for AAG. The tryptophan substitution (Y162W) appeared to be conservative, because the mutant protein retained a highly favorable equilibrium constant for flipping the 1,N6-ethenoadenine (ϵA) lesion, and the rate of N-glycosidic bond cleavage was identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. We assigned the tryptophan fluorescence signal from Y162W by removing two native tryptophan residues (W270A/W284A). Stopped-flow experiments then demonstrated that the change in tryptophan fluorescence of the Y162W mutant is extremely rapid upon binding to either damaged or undamaged DNA, much faster than the lesion-recognition and nucleotide flipping steps that were independently determined by monitoring the ϵA fluorescence. These observations suggest that intercalation by this aromatic residue is one of the earliest steps in the search for DNA damage and that this interaction is important for the progression of AAG from nonspecific searching to specific-recognition complexes.

Nucleobases of DNA readily react with intracellular and environmental agents to form damaged base lesions. Failure to repair these base lesions leads to mutations or cell death (1Lindahl T. Instability and decay of the primary structure of DNA.Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4325) Google Scholar, 2Robertson A.B. Klungland A. Rognes T. Leiros I. DNA repair in mammalian cells: base excision repair: the long and short of it.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 981-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The base excision repair pathway is the main mechanism by which single base lesions in DNA are repaired (3Krokan H.E. Bjørås M. Base excision repair.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a012583Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The base excision repair pathway is initiated by a DNA glycosylase that is responsible for finding the damaged site and catalyzing the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond. Subsequent action of an abasic-site specific endonuclease, a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase, a DNA repair polymerase, and a DNA ligase are required to restore the correct DNA sequence, using the intact strand as a template. There are 11 known human DNA glycosylases that belong to 4 different structural superfamilies. Despite their structural differences, all have adopted the common strategy of nucleotide flipping to access base lesions in duplex DNA. Nucleotide or base flipping describes the complete 180° rotation of a nucleotide out of the DNA duplex to position the target nucleobase into an enzyme active site, and this general mechanism has been described for many types of DNA modifying enzymes (4Roberts R.J.

The minimal kinetic mechanism for the recognition, flipping, and excision of 1,N6-ethenoadenine (ϵA) was previously determined by following the changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of this lesion (9Wolfe A.E.

Transient-kinetic experiments indicated that an initial recognition complex is rapidly and reversibly formed in which the ϵA lesion is partially unstacked. Subsequently the ϵA lesion is flipped out of the duplex into the active site to form a stable specific-recognition complex that positions the N-glycosidic bond for hydrolysis. This kinetic model has been guided by the crystal structures of AAG bound specifically to DNA that implicate a highly conserved β hairpin (β3β4) in specific DNA recognition (11Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D.

The tip of this β hairpin projects into the minor groove, placing the side chain of Tyr162 within the duplex where it occupies the space vacated by the base lesion (Fig. 1). alkyladenine DNA glycosylase, also known as methylpurine DNA glycosylase and 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase 1,N6-ethenoadenine hypoxanthine deoxyinosine sodium 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonate. Recent characterization of a mutant enzyme lacking this tyrosine side chain (Y162A) demonstrated that this mutation destabilizes the flipped-out specific-recognition complex because of an accelerated rate of unflipping (13Hendershot J.M. O'Brien P.J. Critical role of DNA intercalation in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12681-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the tyrosine serving as a steric plug to prevent the lesion nucleotide from returning to the DNA duplex. In addition, the Y162A mutant of AAG catalyzes nucleotide flipping 50-fold faster than observed for the WT enzyme, and the initial DNA-binding and DNA-searching steps became too fast to measure by stopped flow (13Hendershot J.M. O'Brien P.J. Critical role of DNA intercalation in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12681-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that tyrosine 162 plays roles beyond serving as a plug. Models for enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping vary from transient capture of extrahelical bases to active destabilization of the duplex. These classes of models can be distinguished by the timing of DNA intercalation, because intercalation happens after nucleotide flipping in the transient capture models and happens earlier than flipping in the active destabilization models. In the current work, we investigated the timing for intercalation by tyrosine 162 in AAG-catalyzed recognition and repair of ϵA. We took the approach of mutating the intercalating residue to tryptophan (Y162W), which provides the opportunity to directly probe the changes in environment of the intercalating residue along the reaction coordinate for binding, searching, and flipping out a damaged nucleotide. To unambiguously assign the fluorescence of the introduced tryptophan, we also mutated the native tryptophan residues that are present in the catalytic domain of AAG. We fully characterized the kinetic parameters for Y162W-catalyzed excision of ϵA to compare it to the WT enzyme and then used steady-state and rapid mixing experiments to monitor the changes in tryptophan fluorescence upon binding to undamaged and damaged DNA. This work demonstrates that substitution of the highly conserved tyrosine at the tip of the intercalating β hairpin of AAG with tryptophan (Y162W) has minimal effects on the overall kinetic parameters. The rate of ϵA excision is identical for Y162W and WT AAG, and both enzymes have similar highly favorable equilibrium constants for nucleotide flipping. The tryptophan fluorescence of Y162W AAG is rapidly quenched upon binding to DNA and does not change throughout the time scale of nucleotide flipping, which is monitored independently by changes in fluorescence of ϵA. This suggests that the tip of the β hairpin intercalates early in the search for DNA damage, and it engages with the DNA throughout the process of searching for and subsequently engaging sites of DNA damage. The Y162W variant of AAG was created via site-directed mutagenesis and purified using the same protocol as used for the WT enzyme. It behaved very similarly to the WT protein throughout the purification. We first monitored steady-state binding of Y162W to ϵA-DNA to confirm stable substrate binding and calculate the amount of active enzyme. The intrinsic fluorescence of ϵA, which can be excited at 313 nm and emits at 410 nm, provides a sensitive probe for binding directly to this damaged base (9Wolfe A.E. O'Brien P.J. Kinetic mechanism for the flipping and excision of 1,N6-ethenoadenine by human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 11357-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that Y162W behaves very similarly to the WT enzyme in this assay, and 100% of the enzyme is active, which is similar to the value of 86% active that was determined for the WT AAG (Fig. 2A). The strong quenching of ϵA fluorescence indicates tight binding of the flipped-out ϵA lesion in the active site (9Wolfe A.E. O'Brien P.J. Kinetic mechanism for the flipping and excision of 1,N6-ethenoadenine by human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 11357-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the Y162W mutation affected catalysis of N-glycosidic bond cleavage by performing single-turnover experiments with enzyme in excess over ϵA-DNA substrate. Under these conditions, the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond is rate-limiting for WT AAG (9Wolfe A.E. O'Brien P.J. Kinetic mechanism for the flipping and excision of 1,N6-ethenoadenine by human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 11357-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Hendershot J.M. O'Brien P.J. Critical role of DNA intercalation in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12681-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Y162W mutation does not perturb the transition state for hydrolysis, because the rate constant for ϵA excision is identical within error to that of WT AAG (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the Y162W mutation may be a very conservative substitution; however, AAG binds quickly and tightly to ϵA-DNA, and effects on earlier binding steps could be masked by the rate-limiting chemistry (10Hendershot J.M. Wolfe A.E. O'Brien P.J. Substitution of active site tyrosines with tryptophan alters the free energy for nucleotide flipping by human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 1864-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore direct binding and nucleotide flipping measurements are needed to evaluate the effects of the mutation on these steps. We used the time-dependent changes in the fluorescence of ϵA to characterize the microscopic steps involving the binding and flipping of this lesion by Y162W AAG under the same conditions previously used for the WT enzyme (13Hendershot J.M. O'Brien P.J. Critical role of DNA intercalation in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12681-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When a fixed concentration of ϵA-DNA duplex was mixed with increasing concentrations of Y162W, an initial decrease in fluorescence was observed that was followed by an increase in fluorescence (Fig. 3A). This was unexpected because WT AAG shows the opposite trend in binding to the ϵA-DNA substrate under the same conditions (Fig. 3A), and it raises the possibility that the tryptophan side chain of Y162W interacts directly with the ϵA lesion in the initial recognition complex prior to flipping. By analogy, tyrosine likely interacts with the ϵA lesion in the WT protein but is less effective than tryptophan at quenching the ϵA fluorescence. Although the amplitude of ϵA fluorescence change is smaller for Y162W AAG than was observed for the WT enzyme, reproducible data were obtained at different concentrations of enzyme (Fig. 3B). These traces were fit by double-exponential fits. As expected, the rate constant for the first phase (k1, obs) is linearly dependent on enzyme concentration (Fig. 3C), and this is assigned to binding and formation of the initial recognition complex (9Wolfe A.E. O'Brien P.J. Kinetic mechanism for the flipping and excision of 1,N6-ethenoadenine by human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 11357-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Hendershot J.M. O'Brien P.J. Critical role of DNA intercalation in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12681-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The slope corresponds to an observed rate constant of 4 × 108 m−1 s−1, and this value is within 3-fold of the value determined for WT AAG (Table 1). The slower rate constant for the second step (k2,obs) was independent of AAG concentration and corresponds to the nucleotide flipping step with formation of the specific lesion-recognition complex (Fig. 3D). The observed rate constant for nucleotide flipping reflects an approach to equilibrium, and therefore it is equal to the sum of the rate constants for flipping and unflipping. To determine the microscopic rate constants for flipping and unflipping, it is necessary to carry out additional experiments such as pulse–chase assays that can measure the partitioning forward and backward from the flipped-out intermediate.Table 1Kinetic parameters for recognition and excision of ϵA by WT and Y162W AAGWTaThe values for WT AAG have been previously published (13).Y162Wkon (m−1s−1)(1.1 ± 0.03) × 109(0.40 ± 0.05) × 109kflip (s−1)3.6 ± 0.77.9 ± 0.7kunflip (s−1)(1.6 ± 0.3) × 10−3(5.5 ± 0.2) × 10−3KflipbThe equilibrium constant for flipping is given by the ratio of the flipping and unflipping rate constants (Kflip = kflip/kunflip).2300 ± 6001400 ± 100kmax ϵA (s−1)(8.0 ± 0.6) × 10−4(8.3 ± 0.5) × 10−4a The values for WT AAG have been previously published (13Hendershot J.M.

Open table in a new tab We performed a pulse–chase experiment in which either WT or Y162W AAG was mixed with fluorescently labeled ϵA-DNA and then chased with an excess of pyrrolidine inhibitor DNA (Fig. 4A). Pyrrolidine is a transition state analog of AAG that binds very tightly (11Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.

Nash H.M. Jiricny J. Laval J. Verdine G.L. Specific binding of a designed pyrrolidine abasic site analog to multiple DNA glycosylases.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8592-8597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), making it an effective trap. The partitioning between dissociation and base excision can be measured, because the protein that dissociates is immediately bound to the inhibitor. For WT AAG, 70% dissociates from the substrate, and 30% partitions to product (Fig. 4B). This end point can be used for calculating the observed rate constant for dissociation (Equation 6). Assuming fast dissociation of AAG from nonspecific DNA, the observed rate constant is simply the rate constant for unflipping (kunflip). When the same experiment was performed for Y162W AAG, 87% of the substrate dissociated from the bound complex (Fig. 4B), indicating a 3-fold faster value for kunflip as compared with the WT enzyme (Table 1). Although the value of kunflip is slightly increased by the Y162W mutation, this rate constant remains significantly lower than the observed rate constant for flipping (k2,obs; Fig. 3D). Therefore the microscopic rate constant for flipping (kflip) is approximately equal to this observed rate constant for formation of the specific-recognition complex. The equilibrium constant for nucleotide flipping is calculated as the ratio of kflip and kunflip (Kflip = kflip/kunflip). The Y162W mutation causes only a 2-fold reduction in the Kflip value relative to the WT enzyme (Table 1), confirming that Y162W is a fairly conservative mutation. We next investigated the changes in tryptophan fluorescence for binding of Y162W AAG to DNA. AAG has multiple tryptophan residues (Trp243, Trp270, and Trp284) that could complicate the assignment of the observed tryptophan fluorescence; therefore we also sought to mutate each of these residues. Each individual tryptophan could be mutated to alanine, but the W243A mutant was poorly soluble, and the triple mutant W243A/W270A/W284A was completely insoluble (data not shown). However, the double mutant W270A/W284A was soluble and could be purified in good yield. Therefore we also introduced the Y162W mutation into this background to generate a triple mutant Y162W/W270A/W284A, which also behaved well. We confirmed that these additional mutant proteins bound tightly to ϵA-DNA and determined the concentration of active AAG as described for the Y162W mutant protein (Fig. 2A). Single-turnover excision of ϵA was found to be ∼2-fold slower for the mutant proteins with the W270A/W284A mutation, suggesting only a minor perturbation of the protein structure and ruling out large structural changes (Fig. 2B). Steady-state titrations were performed with each AAG variant, measuring the tryptophan fluorescence at increasing concentrations of ϵA-DNA (Fig. 5A). As previously reported, WT AAG exhibits 20% quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon binding to damaged DNA (10Hendershot J.M. Wolfe A.E. O'Brien P.J. Substitution of active site tyrosines with tryptophan alters the free energy for nucleotide flipping by human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 1864-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, Y162W AAG is quenched by 40%, suggesting that the tryptophan at position 162 is sensitive to DNA binding. The quenching of AAG fluorescence is completely eliminated by the W270A/W284A mutations, suggesting that the fluorescence of Trp243 is not sensitive to DNA binding and demonstrating a clean background for the introduction of the Y162W mutation. The fluorescence quenching of the Y162W/W270A/W284A mutant is also ∼20%, consistent with the quenching amplitudes of the WT and other mutant enzymes. The stoichiometric quenching of ϵA fluorescence by each of these AAG variants demonstrates that the specific-recognition complex was formed (Fig. 2A). To test nonspecific DNA binding, these titrations were repeated with undamaged DNA duplex, and the changes in tryptophan fluorescence are summarized in Fig. 5B. In each case, the magnitude of tryptophan quenching was almost identical whether or not the DNA contained an ϵA site. These results establish that Y162W and one or both of the pair of native tryptophan residues (Trp270/Trp284) are sensitive to nonspecific DNA binding. We next performed stopped-flow fluorescence experiments to probe the transient changes in tryptophan fluorescence that occur during the early steps associated with finding and flipping out an ϵA lesion. Y162W AAG showed a rapid quenching of fluorescence that occurred within the dead time of the stopped flow (≤2 ms) and no other detectable changes over 2 s (Fig. 6A). Under the same conditions, the ϵA fluorescence for Y162W binding to ϵA-DNA demonstrates formation of the initial recognition complex and flipping to form the specific-recognition complex (Fig. 3B). This strongly suggests that the tryptophan fluorescence is quenched upon initial binding to DNA. Consistent with this model, when the experiments were repeated with undamaged DNA, the tryptophan fluorescence was again quenched rapidly upon initial DNA binding (Fig. 6B). Because it was possible that the changes in Trp270/Trp284 were masking changes in Y162W fluorescence, the stopped-flow experiments were repeated with Y162W/W270A/W284A AAG. Once again, the tryptophan fluorescence was fully quenched upon initial DNA binding regardless of whether the DNA contained a site of damage (Fig. 6, C and D). The W270A/W284A mutant enzyme was not quenched by binding to DNA, suggesting that the introduced Y162W tryptophan in the triple mutant enzyme is responsible for the rapid quenching of tryptophan fluorescence that occurs on binding to either damaged or undamaged DNA. We did not observe any further changes in the tryptophan fluorescence throughout the entirety of the searching and flipping process. Taken together, these results suggest that tryptophan 162 intercalates rapidly into the DNA upon nonspecific DNA binding. Given the similar overall kinetic parameters of Y162W and WT AAG, we expect a similar intercalation by the native tyrosine at this position. Because AAG recognizes a wide variety of alkylated and deaminated bases, we investigated the effects of mutating Tyr162 on the maximal single-turnover rate constant for excision of Hx. We used the gel-based assay to determine glycosylase activity for the natural context for deamination of deoxyadenosine to deoxyinosine (I·T) and for a single nucleotide bulge context that is also efficiently recognized by WT AAG (15Lyons D.M. O'Brien P.J. Efficient recognition of an unpaired lesion by a DNA repair glycosylase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131: 17742-17743Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). WT AAG removes Hx from an I·T base pair or from a single nucleotide I bulge with similar maximal rate constants (Fig. 7A). As expected, the single-turnover rate constant was independent of the concentration of enzyme under these conditions (kobs = kmax), and the rate constants are summarized in Table 2. Y162W AAG exhibits similar rate constants for excision of Hx from these same contexts, providing additional evidence that the Y162W substitution is minimally perturbing (Fig. 7B). For comparison, we revisited the previously described Y162A mutation of AAG, which greatly alters the kinetics and thermodynamics of nucleotide flipping for ϵA-DNA (13Hendershot J.M. O'Brien P.J. Critical role of DNA intercalation in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12681-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Y162A mutation strongly reduced the maximal rate of Hx excision from both contexts (Fig. 7C). The 350-fold reduction in Hx excision for Y162A relative to WT AAG demonstrates the importance of an aromatic side chain for efficient engagement of the target site (Table 2).Table 2Single-turnover rate constants for excision of Hx by AAGkmax min−1krel (WT/mutant)aThe values of the relative rate constant (krel) are for I·T but similar to those calculated for the I bulge.I·TI bulgeWT2.9 ± 0.052.3 ± 0.3(1)Y162W1.2 ± 0.10.81 ± 0.132.4Y162A0.0083 ± 0.00140.0049 ± 0.0006350a The values of the relative rate constant (krel) are for I·T but similar to those calculated for the I bulge. Open table in a new tab The β3β4 hairpin and the intercalating residue, Tyr162, are highly conserved among AAG homologs, and extensive random mutagenesis failed to identify functional variants at this position (16Guo H.H. Choe J. Loeb L.A. Protein tolerance to random amino acid change.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9205-9210Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Previously this residue was shown to be critical for in vivo function, and the Y162A mutant is unable to protect cells against exogenous alkylating agents (12Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Molecular basis for discriminating between normal and damaged bases by the human alkyladenine glycosylase, AAG.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies suggest that Tyr162 plays multiple roles in the search for DNA damage. It appears to act as a plug to slow the rate of unflipping, thereby stabilizing the specific lesion-recognition complex (13Hendershot J.M. O'Brien P.J. Critical role of DNA intercalation in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12681-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This result is supported by crystal structures of extrahelical AAG complexes in which the side chain of Tyr162 occupies the position vacated by the flipped-out nucleobase (11Lau A.Y. Schärer O.D.

In addition to this expected result, it has been shown that Tyr162 is responsible for slowing the process of nucleotide flipping (13Hendershot J.M. O'Brien P.J. Critical role of DNA intercalation in enzyme-catalyzed nucleotide flipping.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 12681-12690Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the current work, we have characterized the kinetic parameters associated with flipping out an ϵA lesion. The kinetic parameters associated with AAG-catalyzed nucleotide flipping that were measured under identical conditions for several different Tyr162 variants, Y162A, Y162F, and Y126W, are summarized in Fig. 8. This kinetic and thermodynamic analysis establishes that both"

Infants with facial abnormalities receive lower ratings of cuteness, but relatively little is known about how different abnormalities and their location affect these aesthetic judgements. The objective of the current study was to compare the impact of different abnormalities on the perception of infant faces, while controlling for infant identity. In two experiments, adult participants gave ratings of cuteness and attractiveness in response to face images that had been edited to introduce common facial abnormalities. Stimulus faces displayed either a haemangioma (a small, benign birth mark), strabismus (an abnormal alignment of the eyes) or a cleft lip (an abnormal opening in the upper lip). In Experiment 1, haemangioma had less of a detrimental effect on ratings than the more severe abnormalities. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the position of a haemangioma on the face. We found small but robust effects of this position, with abnormalities in the top and on the left of the face receiving lower cuteness ratings. This is consistent with previous research showing that people attend more to the top of the face (particularly the eyes) and to the left hemifield."
