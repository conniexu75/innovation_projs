https://openalex.org/W2154084570,Tolerance and physical dependence development to morphine in mice can be prevented by concomitant administration of cycloheximide. The fact that the rate of synthesis of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) increases with tolerance to morphine suggests that the protein involved may be associated with 5HT synthesis. Inhibition of this synthesis with p-chlorophenylalanine markedly decreases tolerance and physical dependence development to morphine.

https://openalex.org/W1533191645,"Abstract Histone fractions, f1, f2a1, f2a2, f2b, and f3, were prepared from calf thymus nuclei which had been incubated in the presence of sodium acetate-1-14C. Each of the histone fractions was digested with trypsin and with Pronase, and the resulting peptides and amino acids were separated by ion exchange and exclusion chromatography. Only the arginine-rich fractions, f2a1 and f3, were found to be appreciably labeled with 14C-acetate. All of their radioactivity could be recovered as a single chromatographic peak which was identified as e-N-acetyllysine. The comparatively lysine-rich fractions, f1 and f2b, were unlabeled and did not contain e-N-acetyllysine. The moderately lysine-rich f2a2 fraction contained small amounts of radioactive acetate and of acetyllysine, a result which may indicate either very little acetylation of this fraction or contamination of the f2a2 by small amounts of the more acetylated histones."

Toxicity to diatoms increased as cell concentration decreased. This inhibition may be of ecological importance."
https://openalex.org/W2055598723,"We have assessed the effects in normal control volunteers of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine, the chemical present in the hallucinogenic drug STP, in two independent trials. In low doses, this compound produces a mild euphoria. Doses greater than 3 milligrams may cause pronounced hallucinogenic effects lasting about 8 hours and similar to those produced by hallucinogenic doses of lysergic acid diethylamide, mescaline, and psilocybin. 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine, which is chemically related to mescaline and amphetamine, is about 100 times more potent as a hallucinogen than mescaline and only one-thirtieth as potent as lysergic acid diethylamide. Its psychological effects are not accentuated by chlorpromazine."

Observer cats acquired the avoidance response (hurdle jumping in response to a buzzer stimulus) significantly faster and made fewer errors than cats that were conventionally trained. Observer cats acquired the approach response (lever pressing for food in response to a light stimulus) with significantly fewer errors than cats that were conventionally trained. In some cases, observer cats committed one or no errors while reaching criterion."

https://openalex.org/W1617312392,"Abstract Calf thyroid particles contain a sialyltransferase which can be released in soluble form by ultrasonic treatment and further purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid from cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid to glycopeptides and glycoproteins. The most favorable acceptors for this enzyme were glycopeptides or glycoproteins from which the sialic acid residues had been removed, thereby bringing the galactose residues into terminal positions. Galactose-free glycopeptides were poor acceptors, and the enzyme was not active on low molecular weight compounds, such as galactose, lactose, and N-acetyllactosamine. The enzyme was not active in the transfer of sialic acid to terminal N-acetylgalactosamine, such as occurs in the sialic acid-free ovine submaxillary mucin. Galactosylhydroxylysine and its N-acetyl derivative were also inactive as acceptors for this enzyme, as were the galactose-containing glycopeptides of earthworm cuticle collagen. The properties of this enzyme suggest that it represents one of a group of glycosyltransferases which act to assemble the carbohydrate units of thyroglobulin, and that its function is to attach the outermost sugar, N-acetylneuraminic acid, to the galactose residues of the oligosaccharide chains. The purified enzyme had a pH optimum of approximately 6.0. The Km for CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid was 2.7 x 10-4 m, while that for sialic acid-free thyroglobulin glycopeptides was 5.9 x 10-4 m. No requirement for metal ions was observed. Another enzyme involved in the sialic acid metabolism of the thyroid, CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase, was partially purified from the soluble fraction of this tissue. This enzyme was used for the preparation of the 14C-labeled CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid used in the studies of the thyroid sialyltransferase."

https://openalex.org/W2068987999,"Curarized and artificially respirated rats were rewarded by electrical stimulation of the brain for changes in the balance of vasomotor activity between the two ears. They learned vasomotor responses in one ear that were independent of those in the other ear, in either forepaw, or in the tail, or of changes in heart rate or temperature. In addition to implications for learning theory and psychosomatic medicine, these results indicate a greater specificity of action in the sympathetic nervous system than is usually attributed to it."
https://openalex.org/W2248014152,"Morphologically intact nuclei were prepared from 1 to 1.5 kg of rat liver by batch techniques with the use of a modified Hobart tissue grinder, continuous homogenizers, and discontinuous sucrose gradients in Sharples centrifuges. Undegraded nuclear RNA was recovered in yields averaging 73 mg per kg of rat liver. For isolation of the 4 to 7 S RNA, whole nuclear RNA was loaded in a zonal rotor in amounts approximating 100 mg. The 4 to 7 S RNA was recovered as a single peak in a yield approximating 20 mg per 100 mg of whole nuclear RNA, or 14.5 mg per kg of rat liver. Approximately 40 to 50 mg of nuclear 4 to 7 S RNA was initially fractionated on Sephadex G-100 columns, 5 × 180 cm. Three major peaks were found, of which Peak 2 contained the nuclear RNA rich in uridylic acid (27 to 29%). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this RNA showed that five bands were present. The three bands of greatest mobility (one minor and two major bands) were closely approximated in the gels and were designated U1a, U1b, and U1c. A band of intermediate mobility designated U2 was well separated from the U1 bands. A slower moving, small band, U3, was well separated from the U2 band. U2 was isolated in an electrophoretically homogeneous state by preparative polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. The base composition of the RNA in Fraction U2, i.e. 22% adenylic acid, 28% uridylic acid, 32% guanylic acid, and 19% cytidylic acid differed from that of the U1 group of 19% adenylic acid, 27% uridylic acid, 31% guanylic acid, 23% cytidylic acid. These data indicate that in rat liver nuclei, there is a group of uridylic acid-rich low molecular weight RNAs that have lower electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels than 4 S and 5 S RNA. Evidence that these RNAs are not degradation artifacts arose from extractions of nuclei with hot and cold phenol and the lack of degradation of high molecular weight RNA added to the preparation."

https://openalex.org/W1602061947,"Abstract The substrate specificity of fumarase has been studied by measuring the ability of the enzyme to hydrate or dehydrate derivatives of fumarate and l-malate. Fumarase was observed to hydrate fumarate and its derivatives in the order, fluorofumarate g fumarate g chlorofumarate g bromofumarate g acetylenedicarboxylate g iodofumarate g mesaconate. With the exception of fluorofumarate, water was added trans to these substrates to produce the threo-β-substituted derivatives of l-malate. Fluorofumarate was hydrated to give α-fluoromalate, which spontaneously decomposed to oxalacetate. Acetylenedicarboxylate was also hydrated by fumarase to oxalacetate. The enzyme-catalyzed dehydration of the l-malate analogues was shown for l-threo-chloromalate, (-)threo-bromomalate, l-tartrate, and threo-hydroxyaspartate. In addition to defining more precisely the substrate specificity of fumarase, these studies suggest that steric hindrance by the substituent groups to proper substrate binding is primarily responsible for the observed order of reactivity among the new substrates reported here. Furthermore, the monosubstituted derivatives of fumarate may form two nonequivalent complexes with the active site, depending upon the nature of the substituent group. Finally, the region of the active site catalyzing the addition of hydrogen may be sterically less specific than the region catalyzing the addition of the hydroxyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1509461633,"The techniques of equilibrium dialysis and ultrafiltration were utilized to study the interaction of urea, thiourea, methylurea, tetramethylurea, acetamide, ethylene glycol, and dextrose with bovine plasma albumin in water. It was found that the addition of anhydrous protein to water containing a nondenaturant (dextrose or tetramethylurea) resulted in an increase of reagent concentration in the protein-free filtrates or dialysates. This finding is interpreted as a highly selective interaction of water with bovine plasma albumin in the presence of nondenaturants; from this finding, the hydration of bovine plasma albumin in these solvents is calculated to be between 20% to 30% (grams of HOH per g of protein). The increase in concentration of acetamide or ethylene glycol (weak denaturants) in filtrates from solutions containing bovine plasma albumin was found to be dependent on reagent concentration, indicating weak interaction of these denaturants with bovine plasma albumin. In contrast, the concentration of urea or thiourea in filtrates from aqueous solutions decreases following the addition of bovine plasma albumin to strong denaturing solutions of these amides. It is deduced that approximately 1 molecule of urea or thiourea interacts per 3 or 4 amino acid residues of each fully denatured albumin molecule. The extent of interaction of small molecules with albumin, in every case, parallels the ability of the molecules to denature albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1561855206,"Abstract A ribonuclease has been partially purified from the soluble fraction of rabbit reticulocytes. The enzyme degraded RNA predominantly to oligonucleotides with an average chain length of six. It degraded polycytidylic acid and polyuridylic acid but not polyadenylic acid, polyguanylic acid, or polyinosinic acid. When natural RNA was the substrate, the oligonucleotide product had mainly uridine, guanosine, and some cytidine residues at the 3' end. The 3' terminus had a cyclic 2',3'-phosphodiester bond. The enzyme was capable of degrading polyribosomes. Hemin inhibited reticulocyte RNase. Hemin did not inhibit pancreatic RNase or RNase T1, but did inhibit pea leaf RNase. Both reticulocytes and pea leaves contain metalloporphyrin. An hypothesis is presented for the role of reticulocyte RNase in control of protein synthesis in these cells."

Results show no rocking movements during ball-pulling; but when ball-pulling was on extinction, rocking returned to its original rate. Chlorpromazine blocked rocking movements during extinction, but had no effect on ball-pulling. Delivery of one free reinforcer was sufficient to reinstate ball-pulling after extinction, but the stimulus properties of the free reinforcer were not affected by the drug."

https://openalex.org/W1593370118,"Abstract Incubation of rabbit reticulocytes with l-O-methylthreonine, an analogue of isoleucine, results in the formation of polyribosome aggregates containing 10 to 14 ribosomes, and an increase in the number of polyribosomes with 2 to 3 ribosomes. Of the very large polyribosomes 86% contain nascent β polypeptide chains of hemoglobin. On the other hand, 68% of the small aggregates carry nascent α chains. In control reticulocytes the α and β chain polyribosomes are approximately equal in number in both these fractions. Furthermore, in cells incubated with l-O-methylthreonine, the total quantity of β chain ribosomes markedly exceeds that of α chain ribosomes. These data provide direct support for the theory of ribosomal movement in the translation of messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2001370528,The concentration gradients of Mg(++) and K(+) in the cerebrospinal fluid system indicate that the (Mg(++)) is higher and the (K(+)) is lower in the extra-cellular fluid of the cerebral cortex than the concentrations of these cations in either plasma-dialysate or cisternal fluid. Such cation distribution demonstrates the existence of an active transport process across the blood-brain barrier.
https://openalex.org/W1520272812,"Abstract A soil organism of the genus Flavobacterium was isolated from a medium containing folic acid as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen (ATCC 25012). This organism resembles but is not identical with a previously described strain, Flavobacterium polyglutamicum. It utilizes the glutamate released from pteroylmonoglutamate by the action of an intracellular enzyme, folate amidase. The relative rates of enzymatic hydrolysis of a variety of analogues of pteroylmonoglutamate were determined in order to characterize the substrate specificity of folate amidase. Gel filtration was used to separate folate amidase from two other bacterial enzymes: one that acts on α-glutamylglutamate and another that splits γ-glutamylglutamate. Enzyme fractions that hydrolyzed γ-glutamylglutamate also released free glutamate from pteroyl-γ-diglutamate and pteroyl-γ,γ-triglutamate."

However, when fed to the desert locust as its sole or chief diet, it does not affect molting, growth, or development. There is evidence that, in locusts, the active ecdysones are dehydroxylated to (alpha)-ecdysone and passed out through the gut in the feces. There is no evidence for any uptake of ecdysones from the gut."
https://openalex.org/W2004808736,Incubation of human platelets with aspirin inhibited glycolysis and produced a fall in the concentration of adenosine triphosphate. When platelets were exposed to collagen there was an increase in glycolysis and release of adenosine diphosphate. Prior incubation of the platelets with aspirin for 5 minutes did not totally suppress the increase in glycolysis after exposure to collagen but completely inhibited the collagen-induced reaction of the release of adenosine diphosphate. It is suggested that aspirin acts on human platelets by inhibiting both release of adenosine diphosphate and the transport of glucose across the platelet membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1575938861,"Abstract Three types of artificial non-heme iron proteins can be prepared from bovine serum albumin. Two of these are prepared by incubating serum albumin with iron either in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. A third type is prepared by incubating serum albumin with 2-mercaptoethanol, iron, and inorganic sulfide. The latter type resembles ferredoxin spectrally and contains 5 to 8 moles of iron and 4 to 7 moles of inorganic sulfide per mole of protein. This protein-iron-sulfide complex however can be distinguished from the ferredoxin, adrenodoxin, and rubredoxin by comparison of the circular dichroic spectra. The Cotton effects in the 300 to 350 mµ region have been provisionally assigned to electronic transitions arising from the iron-protein interaction, whereas the Cotton effects in 350 to 440 mµ region appear to be related to iron-sulfide interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1991337041,"The restoration of marrow in a mechanically depleted segment of rabbit femur is locally determined and apparently initiated by cells normally resident in bone. This conclusion follows from results of two types of radiation experiments: local x-irradiation of the femur shaft immediately before depopulation and x-irradiation of the total body with exception of the femur diaphysis which was depopulated either just before or after irradiation. In contrast to the rapid initiation of marrow restoration in an unirradiated femur, there was little regeneration during the first 3 weeks in an irradiated femur. Recovery of the shielded depopulated femur in the rabbit that otherwise received total-body irradiation was similar to that in the unirradiated animal. Hence, it would appear that the seeding of circulating hemic stem cells is not essential to repopulation and that cells with hematopoietic potential are present in osseous tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1490035133,"Abstract Investigation of the direct incorporation of 14C-carboxyl- and 14C-carbonyl-d-dethiobiotin both randomly labeled with 3H into biotin in Aspergillus niger has revealed the following. The present results confirm our earlier evidence that 14C-carboxyl- and 14C-carbonyl-d-dethiobiotin is incorporated into biotin and show, moreover, that the dethiobiotin molecule is incorporated relatively intact into the biotin molecule, as the ratio 3H:14C remains nearly constant. The data provide some evidence that approximately 4 or more hydrogens must be abstracted from dethiobiotin in this over-all conversion."

The pathway by which l-mannose is degraded in this organism has been elucidated. An isomerase catalyzes the conversion of l-mannose to l-fructose, which is phosphorylated with adenosine 5'-triphosphate by a kinase to yield l-fructose 1-phosphate. l-Fructose 1-phosphate is cleaved by an aldolase to yield dihydroxyacetone phosphate and l-glyceraldehyde. The two intermediates in the pathway, l-fructose and l-fructose 1-phosphate, have been isolated and characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1994338890,"Homing salmon were injected intracranially with puromycin, actinomycin D, or cycloheximide. From 4 to 7 hours after such treatment these agents markedly inhibited olfactory bulbar discrimination between home water and other natural waters, including spawning sites for other groups of salmon. At longer intervals after treatment there was a partial restoration of olfactory memory-based discrimination. The dosages of the inhibitors used could be shown to have depressed incorporation of H(3)-leucine into protein by 78 percent or of H(3)-uridine into RNA by 41 percent in the salmon brains 4 hours after intracranial injection. These findings suggest that acute blockage of RNA synthesis or protein synthesis can interfere with long-term olfactory memory in anadromous salmon, at least as this function can be analyzed by electrophysiological methods. This implies that long-term olfactory memory depends upon continued metabolism of RNA and continued protein synthesis."

Heating parts of the forebrain with water at 25 degrees C circulating through a pair of thermodes astraddle rostral parts of the forebrain shortened the time spent in the warm water and lessened the incease in deep-body temperature before exit from the warm water. Cooling the forebrain to about -1 degrees C caused a large increase in the body temperature and sometimes suppressed the escape from the warm water."
https://openalex.org/W2022343781,"The interaction between target cells (mouse sarcoma cells) and syngeneic immunocytes (peritoneal cells) in close proximity but without direct contact was studied. The two cell types were separated by Millipore membranes, which allow diffusion of substances of large molecular size, in an assembly which permits cultivation of target cells on one side of the membrane and immunocytes on the other side. When brought into proximity in this manner for 48 to 72 hours, immunocytes from donors which had been immunized against syngeneic tumors caused destruction of the target cells. Since serum from immunized donors had no effect, it appears that the immunocytes produced a diffusible cytotoxic substance (or substances) which may be different from typical antibody."
