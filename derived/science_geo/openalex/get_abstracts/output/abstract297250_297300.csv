In tomato plants, it causes a lethal necrotic disease which is probably the same as that which, in 1972, destroyed most of the field tomato crop in large regions of the French Alsace."
https://openalex.org/W2032140369,"Rhizobium spp. show chemotaxis to plant root exudates. A glycoprotein has been isolated from the root exudates of birdsfoot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus, which, at micromolar concentrations, attracts six strains of rhizobia. This glycoprotein has been given the trivial name trefoil chemotactin and contains approximately twice as much protein as carbohydrate. Gel filtration of trefoil chemotactin on a Bio-Gel A-1.5m column gave a molecular weight of approximately 60,000. Trefoil chemotactin represents a new class of chemoattractants for bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W2054885495,"Pollen of Brassica exhibited strong self-incompatibility. It did not germinate on, adhere to, or extend into the stigmatic tissues of the female parent plant. In contrast, pollen that had been treated with cycloheximide germinated on and penetrated into self-stigmas to the same degree as untreated pollen placed on crossstigmas (compatible). Germ tubes from cycloheximide-treated pollen did not continue growth through stylar tissues and therefore were unable to effect fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2062610723,Four dives were made to the floor of the Middle-America Trench with the U.S. Navy's deep research submersible DSV Turtle. The area investigated is located between Costa Rica and the Cocos Ridge where the depth of the trench floor does not exceed the 2000-meter capability of the submersible. At the axis of the trench floor a series of steep northeast-facing scarps 10 to 20 meters high lie parallel to the trench axis. Here oceanic crust appears to have been carried down by near-vertical normal vaults of small displacement. Between these small scarps and the landward wall of the trench a narrow line of recent deformation interrupts a smooth apron. Unconsolidated sediments are thrust in sharply serrated piles and cut by sharp-edged chasms. This line of deformation is interpreted as the present sea floor trace of crustal subduction.
