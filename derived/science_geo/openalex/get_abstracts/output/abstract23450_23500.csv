https://openalex.org/W2043066069,"The vast majority of cortical thymocytes die during T cell development while those that survive this selective process accumulate in the medulla. bcl-2, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in certain cell lines. In the thymus, bcl-2 is regionally localized to the mature T cells of the medulla. To assess the role of bcl-2 in the programmed death of thmocytes, we generated transgenic mice that redirected bcl-2 expression to cortical thymocytes. bcl-2 protected immature CD4+8+ thymocytes from glucocorticoid, radiation, and anti-CD3-induced apoptosis. Moreover, bcl-2 altered T cell maturation, resulting in increased percentages of CD3hi and CD4âˆ’8+ thymocytes. Despite this, clonal deletion of T cells that recognize endogenous superantigens still occurred. This transgenic model indicates that multiple death pathways operate within the thymus that can be distinguished by their dependence on bcl-2."
https://openalex.org/W1984294894,"We have previously shown that Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells grown in collagen gels in the presence of fibroblasts or fibroblast-conditioned medium (CM) form branching tubules, instead of the spherical cysts that develop under control conditions. We now report that the fibroblast-derived molecule responsible for epithelial tubulogenesis is hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). First, addition of exogenous HGF to cultures of MDCK cells induces formation of epithelial tubules. Second, the tubulogenic activity of fibroblast CM is completely abrogated by antibodies to HGF. These results demonstrate that HGF, a polypeptide that was identified as a mitogen for cultured hepatocytes, has the properties of a paracrine mediator of epithelial morphogenesis, and suggest that it may play important roles in the formation of parenchymal organs during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2015446431,"Cyclin A protein is synthesized and localized into the nucleus at the onset of S phase in nontransformed mammalian fibroblasts. Inhibition of cyclin A synthesis or activity through microinjection of plasmids encoding antisense cyclin A cDNA or affinity-purified anti-cyclin A antibodies during G1 phase was shown to abolish the nuclear staining for cyclin A in plasmid-injected cells, and both procedures led to inhibition of DNA synthesis. No similar effect was observed with injection of other antisense vectors including antisense cyclin B, and reinjection of purified human cyclin A protein into cyclin A antisense-injected cells effectively relieved this inhibition of DNA synthesis. Taken together, these data suggest that cyclin A plays a major role in the control of DNA replication in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2021099633,"Antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, including phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, protect against brain damage in neurological disorders such as stroke. However, these agents have psychotomimetic properties in humans and morphologically damage neurons in the cerebral cortex of rats. It is now shown that the morphological damage can be prevented by certain anticholinergic drugs or by diazepam and barbiturates, which act at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-channel complex and are known to suppress the psychotomimetic symptoms caused by ketamine. Thus, it may be possible to prevent the unwanted side effects of NMDA antagonists, thereby enhancing their utility as neuroprotective drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2022475320,"Cell membranes often are patchy, composed of lateral domains. These domains may be formed by barriers within or on either side of the membrane bilayer. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 molecules that were either transmembrane- (H-2Db) or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored (Qa2) were labeled with antibody-coated gold particles and moved across the cell surface with a laser optical tweezers until they encountered a barrier, the barrier-free path length (BFP). At room temperature, the BFPs of Qa2 and H-2Db were 1.7 +/- 0.2 and 0.6 +/- 0.1 (micrometers +/- SEM), respectively. Barriers persisted at 34 degrees C, although the BFP for both MHC molecules was fivefold greater at 34 degrees C than at 23 degrees C. This indicates that barriers to lateral movement are primarily on the cytoplasmic half of the membrane and are dynamic."
https://openalex.org/W1991771956,"Mice homozygous for the recessive mutation swaying (sw) are characterized by ataxia and hypertonia, attributed to the malformation of anterior regions of the cerebellum. We show that sw is a deletion of a single base pair from the proto-oncogene Wnt-1. The deletion is predicted to cause premature termination of translation, eliminating the carboxy-terminal half of the Wnt-1 protein. Histological examination shows that sw is phenotypically identical to a previously described wnt-1 mutation introduced into mice by gene targeting. Although both mutations in Wnt-1 disrupt primarily the development of the anterior cerebellum, they also exhibit a variability in expressivity such that rostrally adjacent structures in the midbrain and caudally adjacent structures in the posterior cerebellum can also be affected."
https://openalex.org/W1497010214,"The regulation of Ca2+ uptake by receptors is incompletely understood. It has been proposed that the Ca2+ permeability of the plasma membrane increases in response to depletion of a critical intracellular Ca2+ storage compartment (Takemura, H., Hughes, A. R., Thastrup, O., and Putney, J. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12266-12271). This hypothesis is based largely on the effect of thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endomembrane CA(2+)-ATPases. Due to the existence of an endogenous leak, inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by thapsigargin induces depletion of the stores. This is accompanied by increased plasmalemmal Ca2+ permeability, without change in the level of inositol phosphates. On the other hand, depletion of the intracellular stores by 2,5-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-hydroquinone (BHQ), a chemically unrelated inhibitor of the Ca(2+)-ATPases, fails to induce Ca2+ influx (Kass, G. E., Duddy, S. K., Moore, G. A., and Orrenius, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15192-15198). In an attempt to reconcile these observations, we analyzed in lymphocytes the mode of action of thapsigargin and BHQ. In addition, we tested the effects of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a blocker of the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. All three compounds released Ca2+ from a common intracellular compartment. Thapsigargin and low concentrations of BHQ and CPA concomitantly elevated the plasmalemmal Ca2+ permeability. Higher concentrations of BHQ and CPA produced a secondary inhibition of the Ca2+ entry pathway, by a mechanism seemingly unrelated to their effects on the internal stores. This inhibitory side effect can account for the reported discrepancies between the effects of thapsigargin and BHQ. The data provide further support for the notion that endomembrane Ca2+ stores are functionally coupled to the plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2002806722,A kinase activity specific for the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II is associated with nearly homogeneous yeast general initiation factor b by three criteria: cofractionation on the basis of size and charge and coinactivation by mild heat treatment. The kinase phosphorylates the CTD at multiple sites in a processive manner. Factor b may possess a DNA-dependent ATPase activity as well. Both kinase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities exhibit the same nucleotide requirements as previously demonstrated for the initiation of transcription. These results support the idea that phosphorylation of the CTD lies on the pathway of transcription initiation and identify a catalytic activity of a general factor essential for the initiation process.
https://openalex.org/W2012488414,"Direct physical isolation of specific DNA segments from the human genome is a necessary goal in human genetics. For testing whether triple-helix mediated enzymatic cleavage can liberate a specific segment of a human chromosome, the tip of human chromosome 4, which contains the entire candidate region for the Huntington's disease gene, was chosen as a target. A 16-base pyrimidine oligodeoxyribonucleotide was able to locate a 16-base pair purine target site within more than 10 gigabase pairs of genomic DNA and mediate the exact enzymatic cleavage at that site in more than 80 percent yield. The recognition motif is sufficiently generalizable that most cosmids should contain a sequence targetable by triple-helix formation. This method may facilitate the orchestrated dissection of human chromosomes from normal and affected individuals into megabase sized fragments and facilitate the isolation of candidate gene loci."
https://openalex.org/W1496161396,"Thapsigargin is found to be a potent inhibitor of the intracellular Ca2+ pump proteins from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), cardiac SR, and brain microsomes. For skeletal muscle SR, the molar ratio of thapsigargin to Ca2+ pump protein for complete inhibition (MRc) of the Ca2+ loading rate, Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity, and formation of phosphorylated intermediate (EP) was approximately 1. When the Ca2+ pump protein of low affinity to Ca2+ (E2 state) was pretreated with thapsigargin, ATP and Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+ pump protein was completely inhibited. In the presence of Ca2+ (E1 state), Ca2+ pump protein was protected from inactivation by thapsigargin with respect to Ca2+ binding and EP formation. The MRc for brain microsomes, which mediate Ca2+ uptake into intracellular (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-releasable) Ca2+ pools, is likewise stoichiometric. Approximately 30% of Ca2+ loading activity of brain microsomes was insensitive to thapsigargin, indicating the presence of other Ca2+ pumping system(s). The MRc for heart is 3.8, indicating that the Ca2+ pump of cardiac SR is less sensitive to thapsigargin. Phosphorylation of cardiac SR with protein kinase A increased the sensitivity to thapsigargin to MRc of 2.8. In summary, we find that: 1) thapsigargin is the most effective inhibitor of the Ca2+ pump protein of intracellular membranes (SR and endoplasmic reticulum); 2) its primary inhibitory action appears to inactivate the E2 form of the enzyme preferentially; 3) cardiac SR shows lesser sensitivity to thapsigargin than skeletal muscle SR and brain microsomes; protein kinase A treatment of cardiac SR enhances the sensitivity to the drug."
https://openalex.org/W1512833616,"The Yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin protein promotes bacterial penetration into mammalian cells by binding to several beta 1 chain integrins. We show here that proteins containing the cell-binding domain of invasin bind to the fibronectin receptor alpha 5 beta 1 isolated from human placenta and immobilized on a filter membrane. Two forms of the receptor, each having a molecular weight of about 290,000, were immunodepleted by monoclonal antibodies specific for the beta 1 subunit or the alpha 5 beta 1 heterodimer. The binding of invasin to the receptor immobolized on the filter, or to whole JAR cells, reaches saturation after 90 min and has an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.0 x 10(-9) M. Invasin binding to alpha 5 beta 1 is inhibited by the 120-kDa chymotryptic fragment of fibronectin in a competitive manner with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 7.5 x 10(-7) M. Furthermore, invasin-receptor binding is also inhibited by the hexapeptide GRGDSP, and monoclonal antibodies that block cell attachment to invasin-coated surfaces also block cell attachment to fibronectin-coated surfaces. These results indicate that invasin and fibronectin bind to the same, or closely located sites on alpha 5 beta 1, although invasin binds with a much higher affinity than does fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1539851897,"The F1 moiety of the mitochondrial ATP synthase is composed of five different subunits with stoichiometry alpha 3 beta 3 gamma delta epsilon and exhibits the capacity to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi. We have previously crystallized rat liver F1 and described its structure at 9-A resolution (Amzel, L. M., McKinney, M., Narayanan, P., and Pedersen, P. L. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 5852-5856). Here we present an x-ray map of this complex enzyme at 3.6 A, which provides a much more informative description of its quaternary structure. The overall dimensions of the F1 molecule are 120 A x 120 A x 74 A. The enzyme exhibits 3-fold symmetry relating the three copies of each of the two major subunits, alpha and beta. As the alpha subunits (but not the beta subunits) contain cysteine residues, it has been possible to identify the alpha subunits by heavy atom labeling with mersalyl and to relate their positions in the F1 molecule to the beta subunits. Significantly, the alpha and beta subunits each exist as trimeric arrays which are organized in two slightly offset, interdigitated layers along the 3-fold axis. In one trimeric layer the alpha subunits are located close to the axis with homologous subunits interacting with each other; in the other trimeric layer the beta subunits are far from the axis, and they interact only with alpha subunits and not with one another. At one end of the structure, part of the interface between each alpha and beta subunit encloses a space or pocket that is accessible to the solvent; at the other end the interfaces between the subunits are more open and exposed. The present work represents the highest resolution map reported to date for the F1 moiety of an ATP synthase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1486850103,"About 30% of the protein in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli strain DK8/pBWU13 is H(+)-ATPase (F0F1), and practically homogeneous F0F1 could be obtained by gradient centrifugation after solubilization of these membranes. The recombinant plasmid pBWU13 carries the unc operon for F0F1. When reconstituted into liposomes, F0F1 formed an ATP-dependent proton gradient and membrane potential. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with F0F1 and solubilized transporters from chromaffin granules or synaptic vesicle membranes could transport serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine dependent on ATP hydrolysis. F0F1 can be obtained rapidly from DK8/pBWU13, and its reconstitution into liposomes with transporters may be useful for monitoring these transporters during their purification."
https://openalex.org/W1584883312,"Transcription of the prolactin gene is suppressed by dopaminergic activation of D2 receptors in pituitary lactotrophs. The mechanism of signal transduction at the nuclear level and the cell surface was examined in the dopamine-responsive GH4ZR7 cell line. Dopamine treatment caused a 40-50% decrease in endogenous prolactin mRNA that was specifically blocked by addition of (-)-sulpiride. To define dopamine-responsive elements, plasmids containing 5'-regulatory regions of the prolactin gene fused to the coding sequences for luciferase were transiently or stably transfected into GH4ZR7 cells. Chimeric transcripts initiated at the authentic transcription start site were regulated in a promoter-selective manner; dopamine or the agonist bromocryptine inhibited prolactin promoter (position -422) activity by 70%, but had no regulatory effects on other cellular or viral promoters. A shorter prolactin promoter (position -78) or a prolactin TATAA box linked to heterologous binding sites for transcription factor Pit-1 was sufficient to confer dopamine inhibition (40%). In addition to the prolactin promoter, we found that dopamine inhibited transcriptional activity of the Pit-1 promoter (positions -258 to +8) by 60%. Surprisingly, deletion of two cAMP response elements in the Pit-1 promoter only partially eliminated dopamine responsiveness. These data suggest that sequences in the Pit-1 promoter between positions -92 and +8, which include an autoregulatory Pit-1-binding site and the TATAA box, are sufficient for negative regulation. In this study, we also examined the signal transduction pathways that link D2 receptor activation and the inhibition of prolactin gene transcription. We found, as suggested in earlier studies, that a dopamine-dependent decrease in cAMP may be important for mediating negative regulation of transcription. However, high extracellular K+ concentrations that prevent dopamine effects on membrane potential and [Ca2+]i, but not cAMP levels, completely blocked dopamine regulation of the prolactin promoter. This suggests that two distinct signaling pathways initiated at D2 receptors may be required for transcriptional regulation of the prolactin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1585713797,"G protein-coupled membrane receptors activate G proteins by enhancing guanine nucleotide exchange. G0 is a major component of the growing regions (growth cones) of neurons. GAP-43 is a neuronal protein associated with the cytosolic face of the growth cone plasma membrane and stimulates binding of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) to Go (Strittmatter, S. M., Valenzuela, D., Kennedy, T. E., Neer, E. J., and Fishman, M. C. (1990) Nature 344, 836-841). Here we have examined the mechanism by which GAP-43 affects G0. Like G protein-coupled receptors, GAP-43 enhances GDP release from G0, increases the initial rate of GTP gamma S binding, and increases the GTPase activity of Go, all without altering the intrinsic kappa cat for the GTPase. Unlike the case for receptors, however, the GAP-43 effect is not blocked by pertussis toxin, nor affected by the presence or absence of beta gamma or of phospholipids. There is specificity to the interaction, in that GAP-43 increases GTP gamma S binding to recombinant alpha o and alpha i1, but not to recombinant alpha s. Thus, GAP-43 is a guanine nucleotide release protein with a novel mechanism of action, potentially controlling membrane-associated G proteins from within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1541236883,"We attempted to establish within which organelle UDP-Glc:ceramide beta 1----1'glucosyltransferase (GlcT) is located and moreover to obtain information about its orientation on intracellular membranes as well as that of UDP-Gal:glucosylceramide beta 1----4galactosyltransferase (GalT-2) and CMP-NeuAc:lactosylceramide alpha 2----3sialyltransferase (SAT-1). An extremely purified Golgi apparatus fraction was the only liver fraction where a ceramide-dependent formation of glucosylceramide could be demonstrated. This Golgi fraction, mainly constituted by stacks of intact cisternae which retained the same topographical orientation as in vivo, was then incubated with liposomal dispersions of glycosphingolipid-glycosyltransferase acceptors in reaction mixtures containing all the requirements for enzyme activity but no detergent. Under such conditions, SAT-1 and other late acting glycosyltransferases were over 90% latent, while both GlcT and GalT-2 were just as active as in the detergent-containing assay; they were still inhibited by EDTA. Sepharose-immobilized ceramide and Sepharose-immobilized glucosylceramide were found to be suitable acceptors for GlcT and GalT-2, respectively, still using intact Golgi cisternae as the enzyme source. Moreover, a part of GlcT and GalT-2 activity was released from intact Golgi cisternae upon cathepsin D treatment. These results provide strong evidence that GlcT and GalT-2 face the cytoplasmic side of the Golgi apparatus, whereas SAT-1 and the other late acting enzymes face the luminal side."
https://openalex.org/W1599922256,"Full-length tissue factor (263 rTF) and three truncated forms have been expressed in human kidney 293 cells; 1) 243 rTF, which lacks the cytoplasmic tail, is fully functional in the chromogenic assay and has a specific activity comparable with that of the full-length molecule, 263 rTF; 2) 219 rTF, which lacks both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, is not functional; 3) the third variant, referred to as TF-PI, is a fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of TF (amino acids 1-219) fused to the last 37 amino acids of decay-accelerating factor which contain a signal for attachment of a phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor (PI). TF-PI is a membrane-bound protein expressed on the cell surface. The PI anchor restores TF activity lost when the transmembrane domain is deleted from the 219 rTF variant. The ability of the PI anchor to restore activity to 219 rTF clearly demonstrates that while the transmembrane domain is not required for TF activity, lipid association is required."
https://openalex.org/W2077388037,"Intrinsic transcription terminators of prokaryotes are distinguished by a common RNA motif: a stem-loop structure high in guanine and cytosine content, followed by multiple uridine residues. Models explaining intrinsic terminators postulate that the stem-loop sequence is necessary only to form structure. In the tR2 terminator of coliphage lambda, single-nucleotide changes reducing potential RNA stem stability eliminated tR2 activity, and a compensatory change that restored the stem structure restored terminator activity. However, multiple changes in the stem sequence that should have either maintained or increased stability reduced terminator activity. These results suggest that the ability of the stem-loop structure to signal transcription termination depends on sequence specificity and secondary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1538347840,"Abstract In nematodes, a fraction of mRNAs acquires a common 22-nucleotide 5'-terminal spliced leader sequence via a trans-splicing reaction. The same premessenger RNAs which receive the spliced leader are also processed by conventional cis-splicing. Whole cell extracts prepared from synchronous embryos of the parasitic nematode Ascaris lumbricoides catalyze both cis- and trans-splicing. We have used this cell-free system and oligodeoxynucleotide directed RNase H digestion to assess the U small nuclear RNA requirements for nematode cis- and trans-splicing. These experiments indicated that both cis- and trans-splicing require intact U2 and U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). However, whereas cis-splicing displays the expected requirement for an intact U1 snRNP, trans-splicing is unaffected when approximately 90% of U1 snRNP is degraded. These results suggest that 5' splice site identification differs in nematode cis- and trans-splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1591284352,"We have purified, to apparent homogeneity, a mucin beta 6N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (beta 6GlcNAc transferase) from bovine tracheal epithelium. Golgi membranes were isolated from a 0.25 M sucrose homogenate of epithelial scrapings by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. The Golgi membranes were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of 1 mM Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha benzyl (Bzl) to stabilize the beta 6GlcNAc transferase. The solubilized enzyme was bound to a UDP-hexanolamine-Actigel-ALD Superflow affinity column equilibrated with 1 mM Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha Bzl and 5 mM Mn2+. Elution of the enzyme with 0.5 mM UDP-GlcNAc resulted in a 133,800-fold purification with a 1.3% yield and a specific activity of 70 mumol/min/mg protein. Radioiodination of the purified enzyme followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed a single band at 69,000 Da. Kinetic analyses of the beta 6GlcNAc transferase-catalyzed reaction showed an ordered sequential mechanism in which UDP-GlcNAc binds to the enzyme first and UDP is released last. The Km values for UDP-GlcNAc and Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha Bzl were 0.36 and 0.14 mM, respectively. Acceptor competition studies showed that the purified beta 6GlcNAc transferase can use core 1 and core 3 mucin oligosaccharides as well as GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta R as acceptor substrates. Proton NMR analyses of the three products demonstrated that GlcNAc was added in a beta 1-6 linkage to the penultimate GalNAc or Gal, suggesting that this enzyme is capable of synthesizing all beta 6GlcNAc structures found in mucin-type oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1503628252,"Although receptors for most steroid hormones are present in the heart, few cardiac-specific target genes have been identified and studied at the molecular level. Transcription of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene, which encodes the major secretory product of the heart, is induced by glucocorticoids. In both atrial and ventricular cardiac cells in primary cultures, ANF mRNA levels are increased 3-4-fold after dexamethasone treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This response to glucocorticoids is completely abolished by the antagonist RU486. Interestingly, ventricular myocytes appear to be more sensitive to glucocorticoids than atrial myocytes. DNA-mediated gene transfer studies indicate that glucocorticoids affect ANF gene transcription via a glucocorticoid response element located in the distal 5'-flanking sequences of the rat ANF gene between -697 and -1,029 base pairs. In vitro DNase I footprinting experiments reveal the presence of two binding sites for purified glucocorticoid receptor within this region. Mobility shift assays and competition experiments show that binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to both ANF sites results in a DNA-protein complex similar in affinity and specificity to that of the well characterized mammary tumor virus glucocorticoid response element. Since glucocorticoid activation of the ANF promoter appears specific to cardiac cells, the interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor binding sites and cardiac-specific regulatory elements of this promoter could provide a model to study a mechanism of hormone-dependent signal transduction in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1542743692,"Treatment of rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) with antigen or ionophore leads to an increase in cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Three major proteins of molecular mass of 72, 92, and 110 kDa are targeted by antigen and a 110-kDa species by ionophore, A23187. The antigen- and ionophore-induced tyrosine phosphorylation responses are dose-dependent and correlate with increases in serotonin release from activated cells. The presence of extracellular Ca2+ is required to sustain the antigen- and ionophore-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation as well as mediator release. A protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, RG 50864, differentially inhibits the antigen-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in the decreasing order of 72, 91, and 110-kDa proteins. The compound inhibition of the 72-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with that of serotonin release. In ionophore-stimulated cells, the inhibition of the 110-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation and serotonin release by RG 50864 occurs in parallel. These results suggest that the 72- and 110-kDa phosphoproteins may represent the respective regulators of serotonin release in antigen- and ionophore-activated cells. The 110-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from antigen- and ionophore-stimulated cells exhibit identical electrophoretic mobility and V8 protease-generated phosphopeptide maps, suggesting that these two proteins may be the same. These results provide new evidence that both the stimulatory actions of antigen and ionophore on mediator release are mediated through enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in RBL-2H3 cells. Significantly, the present study suggests the presence of multiple tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways in RBL cells and that their selective utility may be determined by the nature of the stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W1596691211,"In pea membranes, UDP[14C]Glc glycosylates a approximately 40-kDa polypeptide doublet. This label rapidly disappears if excess unlabeled UDP-Glc, or UDP, is added, indicating that the glycosylation is reversible, and suggesting that the glycosylated polypeptides might be intermediates in a glycosyl transfer reaction. Glycosylation of the doublet requires a divalent cation, the effective ions being the same (except for Zn2+) as those that activate Golgi-localized beta-glucan synthase (GS-I) activity. Treatments that inhibit GS-I also inhibit doublet glycosylation. The doublet is associated with Golgi (and to a minor extent with plasma) membranes and occurs also in the soluble fraction. The Golgi-bound doublet may be a component of the GS-I system. Immunological, inactivation, and fractionation evidence indicates that at least one other polypeptide is required in GS-I activity."
https://openalex.org/W92210024,"The membrane-bound beta-glucan synthase from Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) endosperm cells has been solubilized by both non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents. A complex relationship exists between the ratio of (1----3)-, (1----4)-, and (1----3, 1----4)-beta-glucan products of the solubilized enzyme, the cations present, and the concentration of the uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose substrate. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the beta-glucan synthase complex were generated by immunization of mice with an unfractionated microsomal reparation. Hybridoma cell lines were screened using a combination of indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay followed by an enzyme-capture assay. The purified monoclonal antibodies were used with Pan-sorbin (stablized protein A-bearing staphylococcal cells) to immunoprecipitate an active beta-glucan synthase complex which had been solubilized from a microsomal preparation with 0.6% CHAPS. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the immunoprecipitated synthase complex revealed four major polypeptides of apparent molecular mass 30, 31, 54, and 58 kDa together with several minor components. The immunoprecipitated beta-glucan synthase complex was capable of synthesizing both (1----3)- and (1----4)-beta-glucans. A new photoreactive pyrimidine analogue of uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose, 5-[3-(p-azidosalicylamide]allyl-uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose was synthesized in a three-step reaction sequence involving mercuration of UDP-Glc, alkylation of 5-Hg-UDP-Glc, and acylation of 5-(3-amino)allyl-UDP-Glc and characterized by chemical and spectroscopic analysis. The analogue inhibits (Kiapp 16 microM) and, upon UV irradiation, irreversibly inactivates the beta-glucan synthase. The analogue was iodinated with Na125I to give a radiolabeled, photoreactive compound, and was used in photoaffinity labeling of UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, UDP-Glc dehydrogenase, and several putative UDP-Glc-binding proteins from L. multiforum. The radiolabeled analogue specifically labeled the 31-kDa polypeptide in the immunoprecipitated synthase complex. The photolabeling of this polypeptide is strictly dependent on UV irradiation, is blocked by uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose and uridine 5'-diphosphate, and reaches saturation at analogue concentrations above 300 microM. These results indicate that the 31-kDa polypeptide in the beta-glucan synthase complex bears a uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose-binding site and is involved in the catalysis of beta-glucan synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1531940908,"We examined the mechanisms responsible for the regulation by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) of the expression of the genes encoding the high affinity IgG-Fc receptor (Fc gamma R-I, CD64) and the NADPH oxidase 47-kDa cytosolic factor (p47-phox) in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Nuclear run-on transcriptional assays demonstrated that the Fc gamma R-I gene transcription is undetectable in untreated PMN but is significantly induced by IFN-gamma. Unlike Fc gamma R-I, p47-phox gene transcription is constitutively active in resting PMN and is down-regulated by a 2-h treatment of these cells with IFN-gamma. The transcriptional modulation by IFN-gamma of Fc gamma R-I and p47-phox genes is not influenced by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Moreover, Northern blot analysis revealed that cycloheximide superinduces p47-phox mRNA expression by increasing its half-life and without affecting p47-phox gene transcription. These findings indicate that human PMN can regulate gene expression by transcriptional and posttranscriptional events."
https://openalex.org/W1534241250,"We have purified an actin-binding protein from the plasmodia of a lower eukaryote, Physarum polycephalum, with an apparent molecular mass of 210,000 daltons on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein bound to actin filaments with a stoichiometry of 1:7-8 in a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent manner. Antibody raised against caldesmon from smooth muscle cross-reacted with the 210-kDa protein. In vitro motility assay revealed that the 210-kDa protein increased the sliding velocity of actin filaments on Physarum myosin. The 210-kDa protein more than doubled the actin-activated ATPase activity of Physarum myosin under comparative conditions of in vitro motility assay. Further increases in the concentration of the 210-kDa protein decreased its stimulatory effects. Ca(2+)-calmodulin prevented the stimulatory effects of the 210-kDa protein. Unexpectedly, smooth muscle caldesmon also increased the sliding velocity of actin filaments on smooth muscle myosin at lower concentrations. The well-known inhibitory effect of smooth muscle caldesmon on the actin-myosin interaction was observed with this motility assay when the concentration of the caldesmon was increased further. The stimulatory and inhibitory effects were confirmed by measurements of actin-activated ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin. From estimations of the intracellular concentrations of the 210-kDa protein and smooth muscle caldesmon in vivo, it appears that effects of the former and the latter on actin-myosin interactions in vivo are stimulatory and inhibitory, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1581266265,"Subunit interactions in the Ca(2+)-ATPase from erythrocyte plasma membranes were investigated through a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and high-pressure techniques. Application of hydrostatic pressure in the range of 1 bar to 2.4 kbar promoted full dissociation of the ATPase, as revealed by spectral shifts of the intrinsic fluorescence emission and by changes in the fluorescence polarization of dansyl-conjugated ATPase. Pressure dissociation of the ATPase displayed a dependence on protein concentration compatible with dissociation of a dimer. Calculated from pressure-dissociation curves, the standard volume change dV0 for the association of subunits was 43-50 ml/mol and K0, the dissociation constant at atmospheric pressure, was 6-9 x 10(-8) M. Addition of Ca2+ stabilized the dimeric ATPase structure against pressure dissociation, whereas addition of vanadate facilitated dissociation by pressure. These results suggest that intersubunit interactions depend on the equilibrium between the two major conformational states E1 and E2 of the ATPase. Addition of calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ had no additional effect when compared to that observed in the presence of Ca2+ alone. This finding is interpreted in terms of the mechanism of calmodulin activation of ATPase catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1487981858,"The 11.5-kDa Zn(2+)-binding protein (ZnBP) was covalently linked to Sepharose. Affinity chromatography with a cytosolic subfraction from liver resulted in purification of a predominant 38-kDa protein. In comparable experiments with brain cytosol a 39-kDa protein was enriched. The ZnBP-protein interactions were zinc-specific. Both proteins were identified as fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase. Experiments with crude cytosol showed zinc-specific interaction of additional enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. From liver cytosol greater than 90% of the following enzymes were specifically retained: aldolase, phosphofructokinase-1, hexokinase/glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, and most of triosephosphate isomerase remained unbound. From L-type pyruvate kinase only the phosphorylated form seems to interact with ZnBP. Using brain cytosol hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1, and aldolase were completely bound to the affinity column, whereas glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, enolase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and most of triose-phosphate isomerase remained unbound. The behavior of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from this tissue could not be followed. A possible function of ZnBP in supramolecular organization of carbohydrate metabolism is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1508982793,"Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an acute phase protein with unknown function. Lp(a) binds to low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, as well as to plasminogen (Plg) receptors. Preincubation of normal human skin fibroblasts with Lp(a) or with apo(a) cause a severalfold increase of LDL binding. Plg and kringle-4 of Plg have no effect. LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts respond upon preincubation with apo(a) with high affinity binding of LDL with Kd values that are almost identical with those of LDL binding to the LDL receptor. Incubation of apo(a)-pretreated fibroblasts with anti-apo(a) completely abolishes the increment of LDL binding. The high affinity LDL binding to LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts could be dissociated by approximately 80 and 54% with 5 mg/ml proline and 30 mg/ml NaCl, respectively, but not with dextran sulfate. The Lp(a)- and apo(a)-triggered LDL binding to fibroblasts have no effect on LDL internalization. These findings may reflect a key function in the role as an acute phase protein and may be relevant to the high atherogeneicity of Lp(a)."
https://openalex.org/W1554636519,"The transport of the F1-ATPase beta-subunit precursor into mitochondria is dependent upon a presequence at its amino terminus. Within the mitochondrial membrane translocation site the potential amphiphilic character of the presequence region may be necessary to stabilize binding to the mitochondrial inner membrane. To better understand its role in protein import, the interaction of the F1 beta-presequence with lipid membranes was measured using circular dichroism and surface tensiometry. These studies reveal that a 20-residue peptide containing the F1 beta-presequence binds to phospholipid vesicles (Kd = 4.5-6.0 x 10(-8)M and adopts a predominantly alpha-helical structure. Although the presequence peptide binds avidly to lipids, it does not appear to penetrate deeply into the bilayer to perturb a reporter probe in the membrane interior. Compared with the effect of the peptides with demonstrated membrane insertion and lytic properties, the F1-beta-presequence appears to displace phospholipid head groups but not insert deeply into the bilayer. High concentrations (greater than 50 microM) of presequence peptides are required to noticibly perturb import of the full length F1 alpha- or F1 beta-subunit precursors. Thus, the F1 beta-presequence alone is not sufficient to efficiently compete for import but may require a protein context or a minimal length to assist insertion into the transport site. These observations are discussed in light of the different requirements for import of various presequence containing precursors into mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1609443702,"Studies with a synthetic presequence peptide, F1 beta 1-20, corresponding to the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids of the F1-ATPase beta-subunit precursor (pF1 beta) show that although this peptide binds avidly to phospholipid bi-layers it does not efficiently compete for import of full-length precursor into mitochondria, Ki approximately 100 microM (Hoyt, D.W., Cyr, D.M., Gierasch, L.M., and Douglas, M.G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21693-21699). Herein we report that longer F1 beta presequence peptides F1 beta 1-32 + 2, F1 beta 1-32SQ + 2, and F1 beta 21-51 + 3 compete for mitochondrial import at 1000-, 250-, and 25-fold lower concentrations, respectively, than F1 beta 1-20. A longer peptide, F1 beta 1-51 + 3, was no more effective as an import competitor than F1 beta 1-32 + 2. Both minimal length and amphiphilic character appear required in order for F1 beta peptides to block mitochondrial import. Import competition by longer F1 beta peptides seems to occur at a step common to all precursors since they blocked import of precursors to F1-ATPase alpha- and beta-subunits and the ADP/ATP carrier protein. Dissipation of membrane potential (delta psi) across the inner mitochondrial membrane is observed in the presence of F1 beta-peptides, but this mechanism alone does not account for the observed import inhibition. F1 beta 1-32 + 2 and 21-51 + 3 block import of pF1 beta 100% at peptide concentrations which dissipate delta psi less than 25%. In contrast, experiments with valinomycin demonstrate that when mitochondrial delta psi is reduced 25% import of pF1 beta is inhibited only 25%. Therefore, at least 75% of maximal import inhibition observed in the presence of F1 beta 1-32 + 2 and F1 beta 21-51 + 3 does not result from dissipation of delta psi. Import inhibition by F1 beta-peptides is reversible and can be overcome by increasing the amount of full-length precursor in import reactions. F1 beta presequence peptides and full-length precursor are therefore likely to compete for a common import step. Presequence dependent binding of pF1 beta to trypsin-sensitive elements on the outer mitochondrial membrane is insensitive to inhibitory concentrations of F1 beta presequence peptide. We conclude that import inhibition by F1 beta presequence peptides is competitive and occurs at a site beyond initial interaction of precursor proteins with mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1489298340,"The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, potentially capable of generating a number of second messengers, such as diacylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, and inositol phosphate glycan, has been postulated to be involved in signal transduction in various cell types, including T-cells. We have identified a panel of T-cell hybridoma mutants that are defective at various steps of GPI anchor biosynthesis. Since they were derived from a functional T-T hybridoma, we were able to determine the precise role of the GPI anchor in T-cell activation. Two mutants were chosen for this analysis. The first mutant is defective at the first step of GPI anchor biosynthesis, i.e. in the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to a phosphatidylinositol acceptor. Thus, it cannot form any GPI precursors or GPI-like compounds. Interestingly, this mutant can be activated by antigen, superantigen, and concanavalin A in a manner comparable to the wild-type hybridoma. These data strongly suggest that the GPI anchor, its precursor, or its potential cleavage product, inositol phosphate glycan, is not required for the early phase of T-cell activation. The second mutant is able to synthesize the first two GPI precursors, but is not able to add mannose residues to them due to a deficiency in dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, all of the Dol-P-Man mutants are defective in activation by antigen, suprantigen, and concanavalin A despite normal T-cell receptor expression. Here, we show that the activation defect was due to a pleiotropic glycosylation abnormality because Dol-P-Man is required for both GPI anchor and N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis. When the yeast Dol-P-Man synthase gene was stably transfected into the mutants, full expression of surface GPI-anchored proteins was restored. However, N-linked glycosylation was either partially or completely corrected in different transfectants. Reconstitution of activation defects correlates well with the status of N-linked glycosylation, but not with the expression of GPI-anchored proteins. These results thus reveal an unexpected role of N-linked glycosylation in T-cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W1589652309,"Understanding the role of Escherichia coli histone-like protein integration host factor (IHF) in replication of R6K plasmid (Dellis, S., and Filutowicz, M. (1991) J. Bacteriol. 173, 1279-1286) requires detailed analyses of the interaction of IHF protein with the plasmid's replication origin (gamma ori). We describe an electron microscopic analysis which shows that a compact structure can be formed in the presence of IHF, in which, on average, a 102-base pair (bp) ori segment is involved. IHF.gamma ori complexes also undergo a two-step conformational change in an IHF concentration-dependent manner when analysed by band shift assay. We believe that the DNA is bent at low IHF concentrations, but folded at high IHF concentrations. This idea is supported by the fact that electrophoretic mobility of the IHF.gamma ori complexes is faster at higher concentrations of IHF. Furthermore, it is shown that the formation of a compact nucleoprotein structure depends on the two regions flanking the AT-rich segment; the iterons to the right and the 106-bp ori domain to the left. Finally we show that IHF protects the entire AT-rich segment of the ori against nuclease cleavage. In addition to the protection, an altered cleavage pattern by DNase I, in the presence of high levels of IHF, was observed within the iterons but not within the 106-bp domain of the ori. Implications of the IHF-mediated gamma ori folding as a possible mechanism protecting the ori from replication inhibition by R6K initiator protein tau are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1504539455,"When the human colon cancer cells HT-29 undergo enterocytic differentiation, they correctly process their N-glycans, whereas their undifferentiated counterpart are unable to process Man9-8-GlcNAc2 species, the natural substrate of alpha-mannosidase I. As this enzyme is fully active in both HT-29 cell populations, we hypothesize that N-glycoproteins are unable to reach the cis Golgi, the site where alpha-mannosidase I has been localized. We have demonstrated this point by using 1-deoxymannojirimycin, leupeptin, and monensin. In the presence of 1-deoxymannojirimycin, a specific inhibitor of alpha-mannosidase I, differentiated HT-29 cells, as expected, accumulate Man9-8-GlcNAc2 species, whereas in undifferentiated HT-29 cells these compounds continue to be rapidly degraded. In contrast, the use of leupeptin, a specific inhibitor of thiol and serine proteases, leads to the accumulation of these oligosaccharides in undifferentiated HT-29 cells. Monensin, a carboxylic ionophore that perturbs distal Golgi functions, is unable to stabilize these compounds. Therefore, we conclude that N-linked glycoproteins in undifferentiated HT-29 cells rapidly egress from the exocytic pathway to a leupeptin-sensitive degradative compartment without entering a monensin-sensitive compartment. These results favor the hypothesis that a direct pathway should exist between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and a leupeptin-sensitive degradative compartment in undifferentiated HT-29 cells. The emergence of this new pathway could explain why protein stability and N-glycan processing may vary as a function of the state of cell differentiation."

We have studied the effect and mechanism of action of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and related inositol phosphates on human red cell membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) activity in vitro. At 10(-6) M, Ins(1,4,5)P3 and D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Ins[4,5]P2) inhibited human erythrocyte membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity in vitro by 42 and 31%, respectively. D-Myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, and D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate were not inhibitory. Enzyme inhibition by Ins(1,4,5)P3 was blocked by heparin. Exogenous purified calmodulin also stimulated red cell membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity; this stimulation was inhibited by Ins(1,4,5)P3. Ins(4,5)P2 and Ins(1,4,5)P3, but not Ins(1,4)P2, inhibited the binding of [125I]calmodulin to red cell membranes. Thus, specific inositol phosphates reduce plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase activity and enhancement of the latter in vitro by purified calmodulin. The mechanism of these effects may in part relate to inhibition by inositol phosphates of binding of calmodulin to erythrocyte membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1534714466,"The adenovirus E1A protein stimulates transcription of various genes. Recent experiments using a fusion protein have shown that E1A can function through a specific CRE (cyclic AMP response element)-binding protein, CRE-BP1 (also designated ATF-2), which stimulates the transcription from a CRE-containing promoter by homodimer formation or heterodimer formation with c-Jun. In this paper, the functional domains required for mediation of the E1A-induced trans-activation were analyzed using deletion and point mutants of CRE-BP1. The mutation in the putative metal finger structure or leucine zipper structure completely abolished the ability of CRE-BP1 to mediate the E1A-induced trans-activation. Furthermore, overexpression of CRE-BP1 or c-Jun interfered with the E1A-induced trans-activation. These results suggest that the complete putative metal finger structure in the N-terminal region of CRE-BP1 plays an important role for the E1A-induced trans-activation, and the heterodimer of CRE-BP1 with the unidentified protein participates in the interaction with E1A."
https://openalex.org/W1579396789,"Two global suppressors (Val-331 greater than Ala and Ala-334 greater than Val) have been identified for temperature-sensitive folding (tsf) mutations in gene 9 of bacteriophage P22 (Mitraki, A., Fane, B., Haase-Pettingell, C., Sturtevant, J., and King, J. (1991) Science 253, 54-58). We have introduced 19 different single amino acid substitutions at the two global suppressor sites independently and examined the effects on the tailspike formation in Escherichia coli. Folding and maturation patterns of the various substitutions at the two global suppressor sites in the wild-type background suggest that Val-331 is located on the protein surface and Ala-334 is in the hydrophobic region. In combination with a tsf mutation, tsfH304 (Gly-244 greater than Arg), only Gly at 331 and Ile at 334, the substitutions that have similar side chain properties to the original suppressor sequences, were active as tsf suppressors. The newly identified suppressors of tsfH304 could also alleviate the tsf defect of three other mutations. The mutant carrying both Val-331 greater than Ala and Ala-334 greater than Val substitutions was also a global suppressor and was more active in suppressing the tsf defect than mutants carrying only one substitution. The suppressors may act by increasing the stability of an intermediate in the productive pathway of folding and maturation of the mutant polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W1587323028,"The interaction of interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) (a product of activated T lymphocytes) and monocytes is essential for immune responsiveness, host defense, and chronic inflammation. In this report we define the IFN gamma receptor (IFN gamma R) on human monocytes as a receptor complex consisting of at least three subunits. Solubilization and immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine- and [35S]cysteine-labeled monocytes were optimized by controlling the detergent concentration during solubilization and washing of the immunoprecipitates. This enabled subunits to be coimmunoprecipitated by several different anti-IFN gamma R antibodies raised against the 90-kDa cloned binding protein. Immunoprecipitation under stringent (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) conditions resulted in the visualization of only the 80-90-kDa binding protein. Under less stringent conditions at least two coimmunoprecipitated subunits (molecular mass of 200 and 38 kDa) were consistently associated with the 80-kDa (90-92 kDa reduced) binding protein. The 38-kDa subunit was shown to be distinct from the 80-kDa subunit by proteolytic fragment analysis. Cross-linking of 125I-rIFN gamma to monocytes yielded receptor-IFN gamma complexes consistent with the existence of multiple subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1492492848,"Among the vitamin K-dependent plasma proteins, only protein S contains the post-translationally modified amino acid erythro-beta-hydroxyasparagine (Hyn). Protein S also contains erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid (Hya). The function of these unusual amino acids, located in the epidermal growth factor-like domains, is unknown. To determine if these post-translational modifications contribute to the functional integrity of human protein S (HPS), recombinant human protein S lacking Hya and Hyn (rHPSdesHya/Hyn) was purified from the medium of human kidney 293 cells that were transfected with HPS cDNA and grown in the presence of the hydroxylase inhibitor 2,2'-dipyridyl. Solution-phase equilibrium binding studies revealed that rHPSdesHya/Hyn binds C4b-binding protein (C4BP) in a manner indistinguishable from recombinant HPS and plasma-derived HPS, exhibiting a Kd in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 of approximately 0.7 nM and a Kd in the presence of 4 mM EDTA approximately 10-fold higher. In a purified component system, rHPSdesHya/Hyn displayed normal anticoagulant cofactor activity in the activated protein C-catalyzed inactivation of coagulation factor Va bound in the prothrombinase complex. In addition, digestion of rHPSdesHya/Hyn with thrombin in the presence of EDTA appeared normal, and 2 mM CaCl2 prevented the cleavage. Together these results suggest that the post-translational modifications of Asn and Asp residues are not necessary for the macromolecular or Ca2+ interactions associated with the anticoagulant and C4BP binding characteristics of HPS."
https://openalex.org/W1519712962,"The Ca-ATPase activity of membranous scallop sarcoplasmic reticulum was found to be unstable when the Ca(2+)-binding sites on the Ca-ATPase were unoccupied. The decay in activity could be slowed or halted by inclusion in the preincubation medium of Na+, K+, nucleotides, ethylene glycol, or high concentrations of choline chloride. Stabilization of the Ca(2+)-free Ca-ATPase by Na+ and K+ showed a markedly different concentration dependence to that seen with activation of the Ca(2+)-activated ATPase activity by the two ions. Examination in the electron microscope of scallop membranes negatively stained in the presence of EGTA under conditions where the enzyme had been stabilized against lack of Ca2+ always showed vesicles containing dimer ribbon structures, whereas unstabilized membranes did not show dimer ribbons. There was an association between the effectiveness of a medium in stabilizing the enzyme in the presence of EGTA and the extent and quality of the dimer arrays seen in the microscope. Comparison of the range of Ca2+ concentration over which the Ca(2+)-binding sites on the scallop Ca-ATPase titrated with the range over which the dimer ribbon structural state was lost indicated that the Ca(2+)-binding sites on the Ca-ATPase must be empty for dimer ribbon formation to occur. Previous studies (Franzini-Armstrong, C., Ferguson, D. G., Castellani, L., and Kenney, L. J. (1987) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 483, 44-56) have found that the Ca-ATPase molecules in scallop adductor muscle freeze-fractured after fixation under relaxing conditions are arranged in dimer ribbons. Thus, the association of stabilization of the Ca(2+)-free Ca-ATPase with the presence of dimer ribbons implies that one function of the dimer state may be to stabilize the scallop enzyme in situ, when the Ca2+ concentration in the sarcoplasm is low and the muscle is relaxed."
https://openalex.org/W1535910333,"Abstract The uncI gene is the most poorly expressed gene of the unc operon of Escherichia coli. We examined how the structural features of the translational initiation region (TIR) of this gene relate to the efficiency of its expression. A set of various TIR sequences was created for the uncI gene by coupling synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides to the 5' part of the plasmid-borne gene. Analyses of transcription and translation of the resulting constructs revealed that weak translational initiation efficiency of the uncI TIR sequence is a rate-controlling factor for expression. Moreover, the identification of an endonucleotytic cleavage site within the 5' part of the uncI mRNA by Northern blotting lends further support to the notion that instability of the uncI cistron within the polycistronic unc mRNA represents a further mode of control. The analysis of the roles of the different Shine-Dalgarno regions and putative start codons within the translational initiation region of the uncI gene revealed that the Shine-Dalgarno region III and the GUG codon (codon 4 of the uncI coding sequence described by Walker, J. E., Saraste, M., and Gay, N. J. (1984) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 768, 164-200) define the main site of initiation. However, manipulations of the translational initiation region led to selection of an initiation codon further upstream. The relationship between mRNA sequence and higher order structure on the one hand, and initiation site selection and initiation efficiency on the other, was analyzed."

On the basis of sequence homology and an ATP binding ability, p70 has previously been tentatively allocated to the 70-kDa family of heat shock proteins (hsp70). We have purified the M. bovis p70 antigen and described ATPase and Ca(2+)-dependent autophosphorylating activities. These co-purified with p70 on gel chromatography and were up-regulated by native proteins and down-regulated by peptides. Inhibitory peptides were shown to bind p70. These data imply close functional similarities of mycobacterial p70 to other members of the hsp70 family, the Escherichia coli homologue dnaK in particular."
https://openalex.org/W1528408456,"The molecular interactions resulting in specific binding of trans-acting factors to distinct cis-acting elements is not well understood. Here we report our attempt to understand the involvement of distinct amino acid residues of the basic domain of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (delta CREB) in the determination of binding toward the cAMP-responsive element (CRE). Using in vitro mutagenesis, we constructed site-directed mutants of distinct amino acid residues within the DNA contact region of delta CREB. The activities of the mutant proteins were analyzed by gel retardation, methylation interference, and CRE competition analyses. We demonstrate that a single lysine to glutamine substitution at positions 289 and 291 of delta CREB alters the methylation interference pattern of the mutant protein for the CRE site. Additional mutants constructed at these positions demonstrate that only identical basic residues at both positions 289 and 291 of delta CREB can restore the wild type methylation interference pattern of the mutant delta CREB protein for the CRE site. These observations point to the importance of the lysine residues at positions 289 and 291 in the process of CRE binding. In addition, this observation suggests that the symmetrical nature of the CRE site is reflected in the DNA contact region of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1594912227,"The 5'-upstream region of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein E protein (snRNP E) gene has multiple sequence similarities to elements found to be integral in the transcriptional regulation of some mouse ribosomal protein genes (G + C block, CTTCCG motifs) as well as U1 snRNA genes (U1 B, U1 D, and SPH enhancers). Furthermore, the immediate upstream region of the snRNP E protein gene lacks typical TATA and CAAT sequence motifs but contains one copy of a GC box characteristic of a housekeeping promoter. By transfection of constructs containing various amounts of the 5'-upstream region of the snRNP E protein gene linked to the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT), we determined that the 5' boundary of sequence needed for transcription was within the first 153 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. Further deletions to within 51 base pairs reduced CAT expression by 2.5-fold. Mutational analysis within this 51-base pair region revealed that direct repeats of the hexamer CTTCCG were essential for CAT expression. Gel shift assays and DNase I footprinting experiments confirmed this conclusion by demonstrating specific binding of proteins to the CTTCCG motifs. This suggests that the direct repeats of the CTTCCG hexamer sequence play a key role in transcriptional regulation of the snRNP E protein gene."
