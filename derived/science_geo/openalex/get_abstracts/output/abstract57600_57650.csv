https://openalex.org/W1506767659,"Superoxide dismutase, which catalyzes the dismutation of univalently reduced oxygen (O2-· + O2-· + 2 H+ → O2 + H2O2) has been shown in mammalian cells to contain copper and zinc. The only reported isolation of the enzyme from a procaryotic organism, Escherichia coli, showed the enzyme to contain only manganese and to differ from the mammalian enzyme in other physicochemical characteristics. We have now purified and characterized superoxide dismutase from another procaryotic organism, Streptococcus mutans. S. mutans was found to contain what appear to be two isoenzymes based on chromatographic patterns and disc gel electrophoresis. The major fraction (superoxide dismutase I) was found to contain 2 atoms of manganese per mole of enzyme as determined by integration of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the metal liberated from the protein. Disc gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed two subunits of equal size. Molecular weight determinations by sedimentation equilibrium gave a value of 40,250 ± 2,000 for S. mutans dismutase, as compared to 39,500 ± 2,000 for the E. coli enzyme. Chemical analyses of the purified protein revealed the absence of copper and zinc. The ultraviolet and visible absorption spectra are identical with those of the E. coli enzyme. Amino acid analyses are reported with a large variation from the analyses of the E. coli enzyme. Superoxide dismutase II was not fully characterized, but was found to contain manganese and not to contain any copper or zinc. The specific activities of superoxide dismutase I and II are 5,500 and 5,800 while the specific activity of the E. coli enzyme is 3,800."
https://openalex.org/W2085164568,A microsuspension of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and of its metabolic derivative 11-OH-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol has been prepared with 25 percent human serum albumin as the vehicle. Intravenous infusion of this preparation to humans indicates that both tetrahydrocannabinols are equally potent in producing the typical marihuana-like pschological and physiological effects.

https://openalex.org/W2095802747,"The spontaneous and pepsin-catalyzed activation of pepsinogen has been observed and analyzed kinetically. At appropriate protein concentrations (1 mg per ml or less), a kinetically first order reaction was observed in the pH range 1 to 3, implying an intramolecular activation mechanism. Substantiation of the first order reaction came from a linear plot of log pepsinogen concentration versus time, with an ordinate intercept at the log of the initial pepsinogen concentration. Moreover a 10-fold dilution in protein concentration did not diminish the half-life of the activation reaction. The first order rate constant of 4.7 per min at 28° was comparable to the kcat values observed for peptic hydrolysis of synthetic peptide substrates. At pH 4, we observed kinetics consistent with a mixed reaction mechanism involving the bimolecular reaction of a pepsin molecule and a pepsinogen molecule as well as an intramolecular activation reaction. Below pH 3, this second order process was studied by observing the initial rate of pepsinogen activation in the presence of pepsin. When the pH profiles of the first and second order rate constants were compared, the first order rate constant declined much more rapidly as pH increased than did the second order rate constant. This fact explains the change from a predominantly intermolecular activation mechanism at pH 4 to an intramolecular activation below pH 3."
https://openalex.org/W1495652946,"Abstract The effect of several antibiotics on peptidyl-puromycin synthesis by native polyribosomes was studied. As previously reported, sparsomycin was a competitive inhibitor of the reaction. The inhibition of transpeptidation by a single molecule of sparsomycin per ribosome monomer was consistent with a Hill plot of the kinetic data. In addition, for sparsomycin the Ki was equal to 1.6 x 10-7 m. Inhibition by althiomycin appeared to be noncompetitive. Chloramphenicol, amicetin, gougerotin, and blasticidin S showed both competitive and noncompetitive phases as inhibitors of transpeptidation. The two phases of inhibition by these antibiotics suggested that peptidyl-tRNA on the ribosome may exist in two distinct states with respect to reactivity with puromycin and the action of these antibiotics. These observations are interpreted in terms of models for ribosome function. Furthermore, it is clear from these studies that many antibiotics previously considered to be inhibitors of peptide bond synthesis do not inhibit peptidyl-puromycin formation on native polyribosomes. Thus, some antibiotics which are strong inhibitors of formylmethionly-, acetylphenylalanyl-, or polylysyl-puromycin synthesis produced little or no inhibition of peptidyl-puromycin synthesis on native polyribosomes. These antibiotics include macrolides (erythromycin, oleandomycin, niddamycin, carbomycin, tylosin, and spiramycin III), lincomycin, and streptogramins A (vernamycin A, PA114A). Since these antibiotics cannot inhibit peptide bond synthesis on polyribosomes, the mechanism of their inhibition of peptide bond synthesis with washed ribosomes and synthetic donors remains to be clarified; effects on such model systems for peptide bond synthesis cannot necessarily be extrapolated to their mode of action in intact cells."

Vitamin C is poorly stored by humans and widespread sub-clinical deficiencies occur. We have investigated levels of ascorbic acid in blood cells from healthy women, some of whom were taking oral contraceptives. We have also studied pregnant women and others receiving an injected contraceptive. None was receiving supplementary vitamins."

https://openalex.org/W1655018333,"Abstract A single protein that catalyzes both the rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate and the dehydration of prephenate to phenylpyruvate has been purified from an operator-constitutive mutant strain of Escherichia coli K-12. The enzyme appeared to be homogeneous on acrylamide gel electrophoresis of oxidized material in 8 m urea. The ratio of mutase to dehydratase activities remained essentially constant throughout the purification. Gel filtration of the enzyme on Sephadex G-100 indicated the presence of two active species. The molecular weight of the major species was approximately 85,000 and that of the minor species (approximately 10% of the total) was approximately 137,000. A value of approximately 40,000 for the minimum molecular weight was obtained from acrylamide gel electrophoresis of performic acid-oxidized enzyme in 8 m urea. It is proposed that the native enzyme exists in solution mainly as a dimer of similar and possibly identical subunits. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is reported."

https://openalex.org/W1490866963,"Abstract At 5° and 180 mm salt concentration, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Kornberg, A. (1969) Science 163, 1410) catalyzes both repair incorporation of deoxynucleotides into DNA substrates and the interchange of radioactive label between free deoxynucleoside triphosphates and the 3'-terminal nucleotides of duplex DNA. The interchange reaction is the result of an equilibrium between the 3' → 5' exonuclease activity and the 5' → 3' polymerase activity associated with the DNA polymerase molecule. The interchange reaction has been used to determine the two 3'-dinucleotide sequences of native T7 DNA, T7 DNA fragments produced by Hemophilus influenza endonuclease R, and λDNA in which the cohesive ends have been completely repaired. It has also been used to determine one 3'-dinucleotide sequence of 186 DNA. Under the conditions studied the initial rate of polymerization is at least three times faster than the rate of interchange using 186 DNA, a DNA substrate in which both reactions can be measured simultaneously."

https://openalex.org/W1568442272,"Abstract At 5° in a high salt concentration and a ratio of enzyme to DNA 3' terminus of one, Escherichia coli exonuclease III catalyzes the hydrolysis of approximately six nucleotides from each 3' terminus of duplex DNA followed by a plateau in which no further hydrolysis occurs. When the ratio of exonuclease III to DNA 3' terminus is increased to two, approximately 12 nucleotides are hydrolyzed from each 3' terminus. Removal of a larger number of nucleotides can be accomplished by raising the temperature from 5° to 25° for several minutes and then returning it to 5°. Thus, under selected conditions, exonuclease III can be used to remove a small defined number of nucleotides from each 3' terminus of duplex DNA. Radioactive deoxynucleotides can then be added to the 3' ends using the protruding 5'-terminated single strands as templates in an Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I-catalyzed repair synthesis. This system has been studied for possible use in the analysis of 3'-terminal nucleotide sequences of duplex DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1526216103,"Abstract Membranes prepared from Escherichia coli induced or constitutive for glucose 6-phosphate transport accumulate this compound from the medium. The transport is independent of the phosphotransferase system, insofar as a mutant deficient in Enzyme I of this system yields membranes fully active in glucose 6-phosphate uptake; and the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate to induced wild type membranes did not stimulate glucose 6-phosphate uptake. Both the rate and extent of uptake are, however, stimulated several-fold in the presence of either d(-)-lactate or succinate. In the case of the d(-)-lactic dehydrogenase activity there is far more pyruvate produced than glucose 6-phosphate transported. Evidence presented indicates that it is the free glucose 6-phosphate which is accumulated, and that this material is freely exchangeable with external compound."

https://openalex.org/W1984867552,THE changes in heart rate during dives by seals have hitherto been recorded mainly from animals restrained in various ways and forcibly submerged at sea and in tanks1–4 for periods determined by the investigator and not by the seal. Heart rate recordings have also been made from seals free-swimming but in a harness with trailing ECG leads from cutaneous axillary electrodes3. The diving bradycardia is probably less profound in seals diving quite unrestrained4.

https://openalex.org/W1650900244,"Abstract Nucleotide polymerization by partially purified f2 replicase in the presence of phage f2 RNA templates is stimulated by salt and by a brief preliminary incubation of the enzyme at high ionic strength. Salt stimulation of enzyme activity is observed with both plus (viral) and minus (complementary) strand RNA templates, is independent of the composition of the salt, and is maximal at an ionic strength of 0.1. The polynucleotide products of the in vitro reaction are homologous to f2 RNAs by annealing criteria. The in vitro product made in the presence of a mixture of plus and minus strand RNAs consists largely of f2 plus strand RNA. Both plus and minus strand RNAs are synthesized in the presence of plus strand template. Less than 20% of the replicase product sediments as 27 S single-stranded viral RNA in glycerol gradients. Most of the in vitro product is present in partially double-stranded species sedimenting in a broad band at about 15 S. These results suggest that the f2 replicase is capable of limited in vitro chain termination and reinitiation of RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1568645528,"Abstract The results of comparative studies on f2 replicase and f2 poly(G) polymerase activities are described. Replicase activity, measured in the presence of f2 minus strand template, is stimulated by NaCl and (NH4)2SO4 at ionic strengths up to 0.1; poly(G) polymerase activity is inhibited by salt. Both activities are unstable (T½ = 5 to 10 min at 30°), require a divalent cation, and have template saturation values of 1 µg of RNA/20 µg of protein. Neither activity is inhibited by Escherichia coli rRNA or Qβ plus strand RNA; both are inhibited by poly(U). Poly(C) inhibits replicase activity if added at the beginning of incubation, but not if added after the first 5 min. Apparent Km values in the 0.01 to 0.02 mm range have been obtained in substrate saturation studies for ATP, CTP, and UTP. Complex substrate saturation kinetics are observed for GTP in both replicase and poly(G) polymerase reactions. Double reciprocal plots are relatively linear at high substrate concentrations, but markedly non-linear at low substrate concentrations. Apparent Km values in the 0.1 to 1.0 mm range have been estimated for GTP."

https://openalex.org/W2073707849,"WHILE examining the results found by Engel and Dougherty in their investigations of visual–auditory distance constancy1, we noticed a simpler explanation than the one which they suggest. Broadly, their results (ref. 1, Fig. 1) lie parallel to the line which would apply if no account were taken of propagation time, but 50 ms lower. This suggests that, while observers have the ability to assess relative time of arrival of the stimuli, they have not developed the skill for interpreting this information; 50 ms, corresponding to 17 m, could be some sort of average based on the relative delays met in everyday life."
