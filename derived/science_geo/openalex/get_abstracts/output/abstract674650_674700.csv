https://openalex.org/W3165594088,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of three consumer-based activity monitors, Fitbit Charge 2, Fitbit Alta, and the Apple Watch 2, all worn on the wrist, in estimating step counts, moderate-to-vigorous minutes (MVPA), and heart rate in a free-living setting.Forty-eight participants (31 females, 17 males; ages 18-59) were asked to wear the three consumer-based monitors mentioned above on the wrist, concurrently with a Yamax pedometer as the criterion for step count, an ActiGraph GT3X+ (ActiGraph) for MVPA, and a Polar H7 chest strap for heart rate. Participants wore the monitors for a 24-hour free-living condition without changing their usual active routine. MVPA was calculated in bouts of ≥10 minutes. Pearson correlation, mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and equivalence testing were used to evaluate the measurement agreement.The average step counts recorded for each device were as follows: 11,734 (Charge2), 11,922 (Alta), 11,550 (Apple2), and 10,906 (Yamax). The correlations in steps for the above monitors ranged from 0.84 to 0.95 and MAPE ranged from 17.1% to 35.5%. For MVPA minutes, the average were 76.3 (Charge2), 63.3 (Alta), 49.5 (Apple2), and 47.8 (ActiGraph) minutes accumulated in bouts of 10 or greater minutes. The correlation from MVPA estimation for above monitors were 0.77, 0.91, and 0.66. MAPE from MVPA estimation ranged from 44.7% to 55.4% compared to ActiGraph. For heart rate, correlation for Charge2 and Apple2 was higher for sedentary behavior and lower for MVPA. The MAPE ranged from 4% to 16%.All three consumer monitors estimated step counts fairly accurately, and both the Charge2 and Apple2 reported reasonable heart rate estimation. However, all monitors substantially underestimated MVPA in free-living settings."
https://openalex.org/W3164167749,"Increased use of crystal methamphetamine (""crystal meth"") has been observed across North America and international jurisdictions, including a notable increase in the presence of methamphetamines in illicit drug toxicity deaths in British Columbia (BC), Canada. We used data from a cross-sectional survey and urine toxicology screening to report the prevalence, correlates, and validity of self-reported crystal meth use among clients of harm reduction sites in BC.Survey data were collected from 1,107 participants across 25 communities in BC, through the 2018 and 2019 Harm Reduction Client Survey. We described reported substance use and used a multivariate logistic regression model to characterize crystal meth use. Urine samples provided by a subset of participants were used to derive validity of self-reported three-day crystal meth use compared to urine toxicology screening.Excluding tobacco, crystal meth was the most frequently reported substance used in the past three days in 2018 and 2019 (59.7% and 71.7%, respectively). Smoking was the dominant route of administration for crystal meth, crack, heroin, and fentanyl. Multivariate analysis determined significantly higher odds of crystal meth use among those who used opioids (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 3.13), cannabis (AOR = 2.10), and alcohol (1.41), and among those who were not regularly housed (AOR = 2.08) and unemployed (AOR = 1.75). Age ≥50 was inversely associated with crystal meth use (AOR = 0.63). Sensitivity of self-reported crystal meth use was 86%, specificity was 86%, positive predictive value was 96%, and negative predictive value was 65%.Crystal meth was the most commonly used substance among clients of harm reduction sites in BC in 2018 and 2019, and was frequently used concurrently with opioids. Comparison to urine samples demonstrated high validity of self-reported crystal meth use. Understanding evolving patterns of substance use will be imperative in tailoring harm reduction and substance use services for individuals that use crystal meth."
https://openalex.org/W3164797021,"GATA transcription factors (TFs) are widespread eukaryotic regulators whose DNA-binding domain is a class IV zinc finger motif (CX2CX17-20CX2C) followed by a basic region. Due to the low cost of genome sequencing, multiple strains of specific species have been sequenced: e.g., number of plant genomes in the Plant Genome Database (http://www.plantgenome.info/) is 2,174 originated from 713 plant species. Thus, we investigated GATA TFs of 19 Arabidopsis thaliana genome-widely to understand intraspecific features of Arabidopsis GATA TFs with the pipeline of GATA database (http://gata.genefamily.info/). Numbers of GATA genes and GATA TFs of each A. thaliana genome range from 29 to 30 and from 39 to 42, respectively. Four cases of different pattern of alternative splicing forms of GATA genes among 19 A. thaliana genomes are identified. 22 of 2,195 amino acids (1.002%) from the alignment of GATA domain amino acid sequences display variations across 19 ecotype genomes. In addition, maximally four different amino acid sequences per each GATA domain identified in this study indicate that these position-specific amino acid variations may invoke intraspecific functional variations. Among 15 functionally characterized GATA genes, only five GATA genes display variations of amino acids across ecotypes of A. thaliana, implying variations of their biological roles across natural isolates of A. thaliana. PCA results from 28 characteristics of GATA genes display the four groups, same to those defined by the number of GATA genes. Topologies of bootstrapped phylogenetic trees of Arabidopsis chloroplasts and common GATA genes are mostly incongruent. Moreover, no relationship between geographical distribution and their phylogenetic relationships was found. Our results present that intraspecific variations of GATA TFs in A. thaliana are conserved and evolutionarily neutral along with 19 ecotypes, which is congruent to the fact that GATA TFs are one of the main regulators for controlling essential mechanisms, such as seed germination and hypocotyl elongation."
https://openalex.org/W3164065119,"This paper explores whether efficacy beliefs can alter the relationship between worry about climate change and personal energy-saving behaviors, controlling for climate change beliefs and socio-demographics. For this purpose, we used data from 23 countries that participated in the European Social Survey Round 8 (N = 44 387). Worry about climate change, personal efficacy, personal outcome expectancy, and collective outcome expectancy were each associated with personal energy-saving behaviors concerning either energy curtailment or energy efficiency. The results further show that outcome expectancies moderate the association between worry about climate change and both types of energy behaviors. Worry was more strongly related to energy curtailment behaviors among those with high levels of personal and collective outcome expectancy. A similar pattern was found for energy efficiency behaviors, which were more strongly predicted by worry about climate change when combined with high levels of collective outcome expectancy. These findings are relevant for climate change communication, especially informational campaigns aiming to lower overall household energy use."
https://openalex.org/W3164599827,"Ethyl ferulate (EF) is a derivative of ferulic acid (FA), which is a monomeric component purified from the traditional medicinal herb Ferula, but its effects have not been clear yet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether EF can reduce inflammation levels in macrophages by regulating the Nrf2-HO-1 and NF-кB pathway.The LPS-induced raw 264.7 macrophage cells model was used to determine the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects of EF. The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and PGE2 were analyzed by ELISA. The mRNA and protein of COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, IL-6, HO-1 and Nrf2 were identified by RT-PCR analysis and western blotting. Intracellular ROS levels were assessed with DCFH oxidation staining. The expressions of NF-кB p-p65 and Nrf2 were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. The inhibitory effect of Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 (2μM) on mediatation of antioxidant activity by raw 264.7 macrophage cells was evaluated. The effect of EF was confirmed in acute lung injury mice model.In our research, EF reduced the expression of iNOS, COX2 and the production of PGE2. EF could inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated macrophages and decreased expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in LPS stimulated macrophages. Furthermore, EF inhibited NF-кB p65 from transporting to the nucleus, decreased the expression of p-IкBα, significantly decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activated Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. EF could attenuate the degree of leukocyte infiltration, reduced MPO activity, mRNA levels and secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 in vivo. EF exhibited potent protective effects against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice.Collectively, our data showed that EF relieved LPS-induced inflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-κB pathway and activating Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, known to be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses by Nrf2."
https://openalex.org/W3164810201,"Matrix metalloproteinase-11 (MMP-11) promote cancer invasion and metastasis through degrading the extracellular matrix. Protein degradation by MMP-11 in tumor cells may progressively suppress cancer surveillance activities with blocking immune response in breast cancer. The aim of study is to analyze clinicopathological parameters, molecular interactions and anticancer immune response in patients with MMP-11 expression and to provide candidate target drugs. We investigated the clinicopathologic parameters, specific gene sets, tumor antigenicity, and immunologic relevance according to MMP-11 expression in 226 and 776 breast cancer patients from the Hanyang University Guri Hospital (HUGH) cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, respectively. We analyzed pathway networks and in vitro drug response. High MMP-11 expression was associated with worse survival rate in breast cancer from HUGH cohort and TCGA data (all p < 0.05). In analysis of immunologic gene sets, high MMP-11 expression was related to low immune response such as CD8+T cell, CD4+T cell and B cell. In silico cytometry, there was a decrease of cancer testis antigen and low tumor infiltrating lymphocyte in patient with high MMP-11 expression: activated dendritic cell, CD8+T cell, CD4+ memory T cell, and memory B cell. In pathway networks, MMP-11 was linked to the pathways including low immune response, response to growth hormone and catabolic process. We found that pictilisib and AZ960 effectively inhibited the breast cancer cell lines with high MMP-11 expression. Strategies making use of MMP-11-related hub genes could contribute to better clinical management/research for patients with breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3164178034,"Family planning methods are used to promote safer sexual practices, reduce unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortion, and control population. Young people aged 15-24 years belong to a key reproductive age group. However, little is known about their engagement with the family planning services in Nepal. Our study aimed to identify the perceptions of and barriers to the use of family planning among youth in Nepal.A qualitative explorative study was done among adolescents and young people aged 15-24 years from the Hattimuda village in eastern Nepal. Six focus group discussions and 25 in-depth interviews were conducted with both male and female participants in the community using a maximum variation sampling method. Data were analyzed using a thematic framework approach.Many individuals were aware that family planning measures postpone pregnancy. However, some young participants were not fully aware of the available family planning services. Some married couples who preferred 'birth spacing' received negative judgments from their family members for not starting a family. The perceived barriers to the use of family planning included lack of knowledge about family planning use, fear of side effects of modern family planning methods, lack of access/affordability due to familial and religious beliefs/myths/misconceptions. On an individual level, some couples' timid nature also negatively influenced the uptake of family planning measures.Women predominantly take the responsibility for using family planning measures in male-dominated decision-making societies. Moreover, young men feel that the current family planning programs have very little space for men to engage even if they were willing to participate. Communication in the community and in between the couples seem to be influenced by the presence of strong societal and cultural norms and practices. These practices seem to affect family planning related teaching at schools as well. This research shows that both young men and women are keen on getting involved with initiatives and campaigns for supporting local governments in strengthening the family planning programs in Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W3164273635,"Two SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern showing increased transmissibility relative to the Wuhan virus have recently been identified. Although neither variant appears to cause more severe illness nor increased risk of death, the faster spread of the virus is a major threat. Using computational tools, we found that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants may acquire an increased transmissibility by increasing the propensity of its spike protein to expose the receptor binding domain via proteolysis, perhaps by neutrophil elastase and/or via reduced intramolecular interactions that contribute to the stability of the closed conformation of spike protein. This information leads to the identification of potential treatments to avert the imminent threat of these more transmittable SARS-CoV-2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W3165698004,"Mercury exists naturally and mainly as a man-made pollutant in the environment, where it exerts adverse effects on local ecosystems and living organisms. It is important to develop an appropriate synthetic biological device that recognizes, detects and removes the bioavailable fraction of environmental mercury. Both single-signal and double-signal output mercury biosensors were assembled using a natural mer operon as a template. Selectivity and sensitivity of whole-cell biosensors based on artificial mer operons were determined. Three whole-cell biosensors were highly stable at very high concentrations of mercuric chloride, and could detect bioavailable Hg(II) in the concentration range of 6.25-200 μM HgCl2. A novel Hg(II) bioadsorption coupled with biosensing artificial mer operon was assembled. This would allow Hg(II)-induced Hg(II) binding protein cell surface display and green fluorescence emission to be achieved simultaneously while retaining the linear relationship between fluorescent signal and Hg(II) exposure concentration. The present study provides an innovative way to simultaneously detect, quantify, and remove bioavailable heavy metal ions using an artificially reconstructed heavy metal resistance operon."
https://openalex.org/W3164227302,"The United States (U.S.) is currently experiencing a substance use disorders (SUD) crisis with an unprecedented magnitude. The objective of this study was to recognize and characterize the most vulnerable populations at high risk of SUD mortality in the U.S., and to identify the locations where these vulnerable population are located. We obtained the most recent available mortality data for the U.S. population aged 15-84 (2005-2017) from the Centers for Diseases and Prevention (CDC). Our analysis focused on the unintentional substance poisoning to estimate SUD mortality. We computed health-related comorbidities and socioeconomic association with the SUD distribution. We identified the most affected populations and conducted a geographical clustering analysis to identify places with increased concentration of SUD related deaths. From 2005-2017, 463,717 SUD-related deaths occurred in the United States. White population was identified with the highest SUD death proportions. However, there was a surge of the SUD epidemic in the Black male population, with a sharp increase in the SUD-related death rate since 2014. We also found that an additional average day of mental distress might increase the relative risk of SUD-related mortality by 39%. The geographical distribution of the epidemic showed clustering in the West and Mid-west regions of the U.S. In conclusion, we found that the SUD epidemic in the U.S. is characterized by the emergence of several micro-epidemics of different intensities across demographic groups and locations within the country. The comprehensive description of the epidemic presented in this study could assist in the design and implementation of targeted policy interventions for addiction mitigation campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W3164350881,"Social distancing prescribed by policy makers in response to COVID-19 raises important questions as to how effectively people of color can distance. Due to inequalities from residential segregation, Hispanic and Black populations have challenges in meeting health expectations. However, segregated neighborhoods also support the formation of social bonds that relate to healthy behaviors. We evaluate the question of non-White distancing using social mobility data from Google on three sites: workplaces, grocery stores, and recreational locations. Employing hierarchical linear modeling and geographically weighted regression, we find the relation of race/ethnicity to COVID-19 distancing is varied across the United States. The HLM models show that compared to Black populations, Hispanic populations overall more effectively distance from recreation sites and grocery stores: each point increase in percent Hispanic was related to residents being 0.092 percent less likely (p&lt; 0.05) to visit recreational sites and 0.127 percent less likely (p&lt; 0.01) to visit grocery stores since the onset of COVID-19. However, the GWR models show there are places where the percent Black is locally related to recreation distancing while percent Hispanic is not. Further, these models show the association of percent Black to recreation and grocery distancing can be locally as strong as 1.057 percent (p&lt; 0.05) and 0.989 percent (p&lt; 0.05), respectively. Next, the HLM models identified that Black/White residential isolation was related to less distancing, with each point of isolation residents were 11.476 percent more likely (p&lt; 0.01) to go to recreational sites and 7.493 percent more likely (p&lt; 0.05) to visit grocery stores compared to before COVID-19. These models did not find a measurable advantage/disadvantage for Black populations in these places compared to White populations. COVID-19 policy should not assume disadvantage in achieving social distancing accrue equally to different racial/ethnic minorities."
https://openalex.org/W3164446558,"Canonical Wnt/β-catenin (cWnt) signaling is a crucial regulator of development and Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl) functions as an integral part of this pathway by linking Wnt binding to the Frizzled:LRP5/6 receptor complex with β-catenin-stimulated gene expression. In many cell types Dsh has been localized to ill-defined cytoplasmic puncta, however in sea urchin eggs and embryos confocal fluorescence microscopy has shown that Dsh is localized to puncta present in a novel and development-essential vegetal cortex domain (VCD). In the present study, we used super-resolution light microscopy and platinum replica transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide the first views of the ultrastructural organization of Dsh within the sea urchin VCD. 3D structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging of isolated egg cortices demonstrated the graded distribution of Dsh in the VCD, whereas higher resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging revealed that some individual Dsh puncta consisted of more than one fluorescent source. Platinum replica immuno-TEM localization showed that Dsh puncta on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane consisted of aggregates of pedestal-like structures each individually labeled with the C-terminus specific Dsh antibody. These aggregates were resistant to detergent extraction and treatment with drugs that disrupt actin filaments or inhibit myosin II contraction, and coexisted with the first cleavage actomyosin contractile ring. These results confirm and extend previous studies and reveal, for the first time in any cell type, the nanoscale organization of plasma membrane tethered Dsh. Our current working hypothesis is that these Dsh pedestals represent a prepositioned scaffold organization that is important for the localized activation of the cWnt pathway at the sea urchin vegetal pole. These observations in sea urchins may also be relevant to the submembranous Dsh puncta present in other eggs and embryos."
https://openalex.org/W3165358345,"To investigate the mechanisms underlying the SARS-CoV-2 infection severity observed in patients with obesity, we performed a prospective study of 51 patients evaluating the impact of multiple immune parameters during 2 weeks after admission, on vital organs’ functions according to body mass index (BMI) categories. High-dimensional flow cytometric characterization of immune cell subsets was performed at admission, 30 systemic cytokines/chemokines levels were sequentially measured, thirteen endothelial markers were determined at admission and at the zenith of the cytokines. Computed tomography scans on admission were quantified for lung damage and hepatic steatosis (n = 23). Abnormal BMI (&gt; 25) observed in 72.6% of patients, was associated with a higher rate of intensive care unit hospitalization (p = 0.044). SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, peripheral immune cell subsets and cytokines/chemokines were similar among BMI groups. A significant association between inflammatory cytokines and liver, renal, and endothelial dysfunctions was observed only in patients with obesity (BMI &gt; 30). In contrast, early signs of lung damage (ground-glass opacity) correlated with Th1/M1/inflammatory cytokines only in normal weight patients. Later lesions of pulmonary consolidation correlated with BMI but were independent of cytokine levels. Our study reveals distinct physiopathological mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with obesity that may have important clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W3165672790,"Candidemia is an alarming problem in critically ill patients including those admitted in intensive care units (ICUs). We aimed to describe the clinical and microbiological characteristics of bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to Candida spp. in patients admitted to ICUs of an italian tertiary referral university hospital over nine years.A retrospective observational study of all cases of candidemia in adult patients was carried out from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018 at a 980-bedded University Hospital in Ancona, Italy, counting five ICUs. The incidence, demographics, clinical and microbiologic characteristics, therapeutic approaches and outcomes of ICU-patients with candidemia were collected. Non-ICU patients with candidemia hospitalized during the same time period were considered for comparison purposes. Early (7 days from the occurrence of the episode of Candida BSI) and late (30 days) mortality rates were calculated.During the study period, 188/505 (36%) episodes of candidemia occurred in ICU patients. Cumulative incidence was 9.9/1000 ICU admission and it showed to be stable over time. Candida albicans accounted for 52% of the cases, followed by C. parapsilosis (24%), and C. glabrata (14%). There was not a significant difference in species distribution between ICU and non-ICU patients. With the exception of isolates of C. tropicalis which showed to be fluconazole resistant in 25% of the cases, resistance to antifungals was not of concern in our patients. Early and late mortality rates, were 19% and 41% respectively, the latter being significantly higher than that observed in non-ICU patients. At multivariate analysis, factors associated with increased risk of death were septic shock, acute kidney failure, pulmonary embolism and lack of antifungal therapy. The type of antifungal therapy did not influence the outcome. Mortality did not increased significantly over time.Neither cumulative incidence nor crude mortality of candidemia in ICU patients increased over time at our institution. However, mortality rate remained high and significantly associated with specific host-related factors in the majority of cases."
https://openalex.org/W3160903937,"During periods of market stress, risk-averse investors reallocate their investments from stocks to gold in a bid to hedge risks. Market participants interpret the induced gold price increase as an indication of safe-haven purchases and a signal of increased uncertainty in the general economic and financial conditions, thereby causing higher gold price volatility. The aim of this paper is to analyze whether this flight to safety effect can be observed during the COVID-19 crisis, which is considered to be a one-of-a-kind crisis and obviously of different origin compared to previous (financial) crises. By examining the interactions between the (option-implied) volatilities of the stock market (VIX) and of the gold (GVZ) and oil (OVX) markets, the main findings indicate that there is a granger causality in general between the equity market and the gold as well as the oil market. During the COVID-19 crisis, a stronger influence of the equity market on the oil market can be observed. Based on symmetric causality tests that are typically employed in the literature, this cannot be observed for the gold market. However, once we control for asymmetric causal interactions, we find that positive shocks in VIX cause positive shocks in GVZ. Hence, the typical flight to safety effect, similar to the one observed during other (financial) crises can also be identified for the COVID-19 crisis. The causality between the equity and oil market is triggered by political factors as well as the economic impact of the crisis which induces a sharp drop in demand for oil."
https://openalex.org/W3164115286,"South Africa is endemic for African horse sickness (AHS), an important health and trade-sensitive disease of equids. The country is zoned with movement control measures facilitating an AHS-free controlled area in the south-west. Our objective was to quantitatively establish the risk of entry of AHS virus into the AHS controlled area through the legal movement of horses. Outcomes were subcategorised to evaluate movement pathway, temporal, and spatial differences in risk. A 'no-control' scenario allowed for evaluation of the impact of control measures. Using 2019 movement and AHS case data, and country-wide census data, a stochastic model was developed establishing local municipality level entry risk of AHSV at monthly intervals. These were aggregated to annual probability of entry. Sensitivity analysis evaluated model variables on their impact on the conditional means of the probability of entry. The median monthly probability of entry of AHSV into the controlled area of South Africa ranged from 0.75% (June) to 5.73% (February), with the annual median probability of entry estimated at 20.21% (95% CI: 15.89%-28.89%). The annual risk of AHSV entry compared well with the annual probability of introduction of AHS into the controlled area, which is ~10% based on the last 20 years of outbreak data. Direct non-quarantine movements made up most movements and accounted for most of the risk of entry. Spatial analysis showed that, even though reported case totals were zero throughout 2019 in the Western Cape, horses originating from this province still pose a risk that should not be ignored. Control measures decrease risk by a factor of 2.8 on an annual basis. Not only do the outcomes of this study inform domestic control, they can also be used for scientifically justified trade decision making, since in-country movement control forms a key component of export protocols."
https://openalex.org/W3165154671,"Ensuring the grain supply-demand balance and achieving grain security had been the main tasks for the government of Bangladesh. On the supply side, Bangladesh's supply of grain products has increased substantially, with an average annual growth rate of 1.99 million tons in 1998-2018. Domestic grain production, especially rice production, accounted for the largest proportion in its structure. However, under the constraints of resources and environment, imports and international aid were needed to ensure a stable and sustainable grain supply. On the demand side, Bangladesh's demand for grain products continued to grow at an average annual rate of 2.09 million tons and its structure was constantly diversified. In recent years, domestic grain production has fully met the grain demand for food use, but the overall grain supply dependence on foreign gradually increased. From the analysis of the influencing factors, the grain supply, especially the domestic production of rice and maize, had the greatest impact on the balance of grain supply-demand in Bangladesh. Moreover, multiple cropping index, chemical fertilizer application per hectare and irrigation rate were the three main factors affecting grain production. As a typical agricultural country, Bangladesh's grain security was faced with challenges, such as high population density, insufficient cultivated land resources, international grain trade and frequent natural disasters. It is suggested that its government should strengthen scientific and technological research, adjust agricultural structure, improve the efficient utilization of agricultural resources and grain circulation systems, and balance the grain demand between food use and indirect use, so as to achieve complete grain self-sufficiency and overall grain security."
https://openalex.org/W3015059353,"We study collective attention paid towards hurricanes through the lens of $n$-grams on Twitter, a social media platform with global reach. Using hurricane name mentions as a proxy for awareness, we find that the exogenous temporal dynamics are remarkably similar across storms, but that overall collective attention varies widely even among storms causing comparable deaths and damage. We construct `hurricane attention maps' and observe that hurricanes causing deaths on (or economic damage to) the continental United States generate substantially more attention in English language tweets than those that do not. We find that a hurricane's Saffir-Simpson wind scale category assignment is strongly associated with the amount of attention it receives. Higher category storms receive higher proportional increases of attention per proportional increases in number of deaths or dollars of damage, than lower category storms. The most damaging and deadly storms of the 2010s, Hurricanes Harvey and Maria, generated the most attention and were remembered the longest, respectively. On average, a category 5 storm receives 4.6 times more attention than a category 1 storm causing the same number of deaths and economic damage."
https://openalex.org/W3164431329,"The plant root system shows remarkably complex behaviors driven by environmental cues and internal dynamics, whose interplay remains largely unknown. A notable example is circumnutation growth movements, which are growth oscillations from side to side of the root apex. Here we describe a model capable of replicating root growth behaviors, which we used to analyze the role of circumnuntations, revealing their emergence I) under gravitropic stress, as a combination of signal propagation and sensitivity to the signal carriers; II) as a result of the interplay between gravitropic and thigmotropic responses; and III) as a behavioral strategy to detect and react to resource gradients. The latter function requires the presence of a hypothetical internal oscillator whose parameters are regulated by the perception of environmental resources."
https://openalex.org/W3164915603,"Slow growing oomycete isolates with morphological resemblance to Phytophthora were obtained from forest streams during routine monitoring for the EU quarantine forest pathogen Phytophthora ramorum in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequence analysis indicated that they belonged to two previously unknown species of Nothophytophthora, a recently erected sister genus of Phytophthora. Morphological and temperature-growth studies were carried out to characterise both new species. In addition, Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood analyses of nuclear 5-loci and mitochondrial 3-loci datasets were performed to resolve the phylogenetic positions of the two new species. Both species were sterile, formed chlamydospores and partially caducous nonpapillate sporangia, and showed slower growth than any of the six known Nothophytophthora species. In all phylogenetic analyses both species formed distinct, strongly supported clades, closely related to N. chlamydospora and N. valdiviana from Chile. Based on their unique combination of morphological and physiological characters and their distinct phylogenetic positions the two new species are described as Nothophytophthora irlandica sp. nov. and N. lirii sp. nov. Their potential lifestyle and geographic origin are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3164981665,"Advanced glycation end products play a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Cognitive impairment is one of the central features of schizophrenia; however, the association between advanced glycation end products and cognitive impairment remains unknown. This study investigated whether advanced glycation end products affect the cognitive domain in patients with schizophrenia. A total of 58 patients with chronic schizophrenia were included in this cross-sectional study. Plasma advanced glycation end products were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Neuropsychological and cognitive functions were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Version, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test Keio-FS version. Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, educational years, daily dose of antipsychotics, and psychotic symptoms revealed that processing speed was significantly associated with plasma pentosidine, a representative advanced glycation end product (standardized β = -0.425; p = 0.009). Processing speed is the cognitive domain affected by advanced glycation end products. Considering preceding evidence that impaired processing speed is related to poor functional outcome, interventions targeted at reducing advanced glycation end products may contribute to promoting recovery of patients with schizophrenia as well as cognitive function improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3164505092,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a key cytokine secreted by type 2 T helper (Th2) cells that orchestrates immune responses during allergic reactions. Human and mouse studies additionally suggest that basophils have a unique role in the regulation of allergic diseases by providing initial IL-4 to drive T cell development towards the Th2 phenotype. Equine Culicoides hypersensitivity (CH) is a seasonal immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic dermatitis in horses in response to salivary allergens from Culicoides (Cul) midges. Here, we analyzed IL-4 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CH affected (n = 8) and healthy horses (n = 8) living together in an environment with natural Cul exposure. During Cul exposure when allergic horses had clinical allergy, IL-4 secretion from PBMC after stimulation with Cul extract was similar between healthy and CH affected horses. In contrast, allergic horses had higher IL-4 secretion from PBMC than healthy horses during months without allergen exposure. In addition, allergic horses had increased percentages of IL-4+ cells after Cul stimulation compared to healthy horses, while both groups had similar percentages of IL-4+ cells following IgE crosslinking. The IL-4+ cells were subsequently characterized using different cell surface markers as basophils, while very few allergen-specific CD4+ cells were detected in PBMC after Cul extract stimulation. Similarly, IgE crosslinking by anti-IgE triggered basophils to produce IL-4 in all horses. PMA/ionomycin consistently induced high percentages of IL-4+ Th2 cells in both groups confirming that T cells of all horses studied were capable of IL-4 production. In conclusion, peripheral blood basophils produced high amounts of IL-4 in allergic horses after stimulation with Cul allergens, and allergic horses also maintained higher basophil percentages throughout the year than healthy horses. These new findings suggest that peripheral blood basophils may play a yet underestimated role in innate IL-4 production upon allergen activation in horses with CH. Basophil-derived IL-4 might be a crucial early signal for immune induction, modulating of immune responses towards Th2 immunity and IgE production."
https://openalex.org/W3164579685,"Electronic mental health services (eMHSs) offer additional options for the dissemination of psychological interventions for university students. Still, many university students are reluctant to use eMHSs. Narrative messages may help increase the awareness and acceptance of quality-approved programs. However, little is known about the usefulness of narrative messages to improve attitudes towards eMHSs. In this experiment, we thus aimed to explore in how far different ways of targeting information to students affect their attitudes towards eMHSs for stress prevention and therapy, and to identify potential determinants of attitude change. N = 451 students (Mean = 32.6 years, SD = 10.2, 75% female, 7% with eMHS experience) were randomly assigned to one of four study arms involving information designed to induce different levels of perceived similarity. While the active control condition only received general information (arm 1, ""information only"", n = 116), the other experimental arms were additionally exposed to testimonials on specific eMHSs either addressing an unspecified audience (arm 2, n = 112), employees (arm 3, n = 115) or working university students (arm 4, n = 108). Two-way ANOVA revealed no impact of information on the alteration of attitudes towards eMHSs for stress coping (d = 0.20). Only a small effect of target-group specific testimonials on attitudes towards online therapies was identified at post-intervention (d = 0.29). Regression analyses demonstrated significant influences of source credibility and perceived similarity on attitudes for preventative eMHSs (ps<0.01), as well as a partial mediation effect of perceived similarity in favor of testimonials targeted to students (95% CI [0.22, 0.50]). Overall, this study indicated no meaningful impact of information on attitudes and limited evidence for benefits of tailored narrative messages. Since attitudes were already positive at baseline, further research with a representative student sample mimicking real-world decision scenarios is needed to gain an in-depth understanding of acceptance-facilitating message features that may contribute to promote the adoption of evidence-based eMHSs."
https://openalex.org/W3165214359,"Urbanization in Central and Western China has attracted increasing attention in the advent of new-type urbanization in China and the age of 'Global Urbanism'. Although land urbanization is at the epicenter of Chinese urbanization, its process and driving forces in counties beyond the Eastern coastal areas are less known. This paper therefore seeks to investigate the spatial expansion and driving forces of land urbanization in Feixi county, a relatively advanced county neighboring Hefei city proper in Anhui province in Central China. Based on the land-use change survey data, remote sensing interpretation data, and statistical yearbook data of Feixi county from 2002 to 2016, it is revealed that the overall scale of urban land in Feixi county increased remarkably, though with obvious temporal and geographical variants. The year 2009 appears to be the cutting line between quantity-based land urbanization and quality-based land urbanization. Land urbanization rate is sensitive to both geographical distance and traffic accessibility to Hefei city proper. Driving forces of land urbanization in Feixi county are summarized as: (1) central city expansion, (2) government-led industrial park construction, and (3) large industrial projects along traffic corridors. A better understanding of urbanization in Feixi county cannot be fulfilled without taking into account the wider spatial process in Hefei city and the Yangtze River Delta city-region."
https://openalex.org/W3165628433,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently developed a non-laboratory based cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk chart considering the parameters age, sex, current smoking status, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index. Using the chart, we estimated the 10-years CVD risk among the Bangladeshi population aged 40-74 years. We analyzed data from a nationally representative survey conducted in 2018-19. The survey enrolled participants from 82 clusters (57 rural, 15 non-slum urban, and 10 slums) selected by multistage cluster sampling. Using the non-laboratory-based CVD risk chart of the World Health Organization (WHO), we categorized the participants into 5 risk groups: very low (<5%), low (5% to <10%), moderate (10% to <20%), high (20% to <30%) and very high (> = 30%) risk. We performed descriptive analyses to report the distribution of CVD risk and carried out univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with elevated CVD risk (> = 10% CVD risk). Of the 7,381 participants, 46.0% were female. The median age (IQR) was 59.0 (48.0-64.7) years. Overall, the prevalence of very low, low, moderate, high, and very high CVD risk was 34.7%, 37.8%, 25.9%, 1.6%, and 0.1%, respectively. Elevated CVD risk (> = 10%) was associated with poor education, currently unmarried, insufficient physical inactivity, smokeless tobacco use, and self-reported diabetes in both sexes, higher household income, and higher sedentary time among males, and slum-dwelling and non-Muslim religions among females. One in every four Bangladeshi adults had elevated levels of CVD risk, and males are at higher risk of occurring CVD events. Non-laboratory-based risk prediction charts can be effectively used in low resource settings. The government of Bangladesh and other developing countries should train the primary health care workers on the use of WHO non-laboratory-based CVD risk charts, especially in settings where laboratory tests are not available."
https://openalex.org/W3165685858,"Bacterial panicle blight (BPB) caused by Burkholderia glumae is one of the main concerns for rice production in the Americas since bacterial infection can interfere with the grain-filling process and under severe conditions can result in high sterility. B. glumae has been detected in several rice-growing areas of Colombia and other countries of Central and Andean regions in Latin America, although evidence of its involvement in decreasing yield under these conditions is lacking. Analysis of different parameters in trials established in three rice-growing areas showed that, despite BPB presence, severity did not explain the sterility observed in fields. PCR tests for B. glumae confirmed low infection in all sites and genotypes, only 21.4% of the analyzed samples were positive for B. glumae. Climate parameters showed that Montería and Saldaña registered maximum temperature above 34°C, minimum temperature above 23°C, and Relative Humidity above 80%, conditions that favor the invasion model described for this pathogen in Asia. Our study found that in Colombia, minimum temperature above 23°C during 10 days after flowering is the condition that correlates with disease incidence. Therefore, this correlation, and the fact that Montería and Saldaña had a higher level of infected samples according to PCR tests, high minimum temperature, but not maximum temperature, seems to be determinant for B. glumae colonization under studied field conditions. This knowledge is a solid base line to design strategies for disease control, and is also a key element for breeders to develop strategies aimed to decrease the effect of B. glumae and high night-temperature on rice yield under tropical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3165664691,"Streptococcus parauberis is an important bacterial fish pathogen that causes streptococcosis in a variety of fish species including the olive flounder. Despite its importance in the aquaculture industry, little is known about the survival strategy of S. parauberis in the host. Therefore, the objective of this study was to produce genome-wide transcriptome data and identify key factors for the survival of S. parauberis SPOF3K in its host. To this end, S. parauberis SPOF3K was incubated in olive flounder serum and nutrient-enriched media as a control. Although S. parauberis SPOF3K proliferated in both culture conditions, the transcriptomic patterns of the two groups were very different. Interestingly, the expression levels of genes responsible for the replication of an S. parauberis plasmid in the presence of olive flounder serum were higher than those in the absence of olive flounder serum, indicating that this plasmid may play an important role in the survival and proliferation of S. parauberis in the host. Several ATP-binding cassette transporters known to transport organic substrates (e.g., biotin and osmoprotectants) that are vital for bacterial survival in the host were significantly up-regulated in S. parauberis cultured in serum. In addition, groEL, dnaK operon, and members of the clp protease family, which are known to play important roles in response to various stressors, were up-regulated in S. parauberis incubated in serum, thus limiting damage and facilitating cellular recovery. Moreover, important virulence factors including the hyaluronic acid capsule (has operon), sortase A (srtA), C5a peptidase (scp), and peptidoglycan O-acetyltransferase (oatA) were significantly upregulated in S. paraubers in serum. These results indicate that S. paraubers can resist and evade the humoral immune responses of fish. The transcriptomic data obtained in this study provide a better understanding of the mode of action of S. parauberis in fish."
https://openalex.org/W3165793397,"There is an increasing awareness that sleep disturbances are a risk factor for dementia. Prior case-control studies suggested that brain grey matter (GM) changes involving cortical (i.e, prefrontal areas) and subcortical structures (i.e, putamen, thalamus) could be associated with insomnia status. However, it remains unclear whether there is a gradient association between these regions and the severity of insomnia in older adults who could be at risk for dementia. Since depressive symptoms and sleep apnea can both feature insomnia-related factors, can impact brain health and are frequently present in older populations, it is important to include them when studying insomnia. Therefore, our goal was to investigate GM changes associated with insomnia severity in a cohort of healthy older adults, taking into account the potential effect of depression and sleep apnea as well. We hypothesized that insomnia severity is correlated with 1) cortical regions responsible for regulation of sleep and emotion, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and, 2) subcortical regions, such as the putamen.120 healthy subjects (age 74.8±5.7 years old, 55.7% female) were recruited from the Hillblom Healthy Aging Network at the Memory and Aging Center, UCSF. All participants were determined to be cognitively healthy following a neurological evaluation, neuropsychological assessment and informant interview. Participants had a 3T brain MRI and completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Berlin Sleep Questionnaire (BA) to assess sleep apnea. Cortical thickness (CTh) and subcortical volumes were obtained by the CAT12 toolbox within SPM12. We studied the correlation of CTh and subcortical volumes with ISI using multiple regressions adjusted by age, sex, handedness and MRI scan type. Additional models adjusting by GDS and BA were also performed.ISI and GDS were predominantly mild (4.9±4.2 and 2.5±2.9, respectively) and BA was mostly low risk (80%). Higher ISI correlated with lower CTh of the right orbitofrontal, right superior and caudal middle frontal areas, right temporo-parietal junction and left anterior cingulate cortex (p<0.001, uncorrected FWE). When adjusting by GDS, right ventral orbitofrontal and temporo-parietal junction remained significant, and left insula became significant (p<0.001, uncorrected FWE). Conversely, BA showed no effect. The results were no longer significant following FWE multiple comparisons. Regarding subcortical areas, higher putamen volumes were associated with higher ISI (p<0.01).Our findings highlight a relationship between insomnia severity and brain health, even with relatively mild insomnia, and independent of depression and likelihood of sleep apnea. The results extend the previous literature showing the association of specific GM areas (i.e, orbitofrontal, insular and temporo-parietal junction) not just with the presence of insomnia, but across the spectrum of severity itself. Moreover, our results suggest subcortical structures (i.e., putamen) are involved as well. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify how these insomnia-related brain changes in healthy subjects align with an increased risk of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W3164526635,"The directional movement and positioning of organelles and macromolecules is essential for regulating and maintaining cellular functions in eukaryotic cells. In plants, these processes are actin-based and driven by class XI myosins, which transport various cargos in a directed manner. As the analysis of myosin function is challenging due to high levels of redundancy, dominant negative acting truncated myosins have frequently been used to study intracellular transport processes. A comparison of the dominant negative effect of the coiled-coil domains and the GTD domains revealed a much stronger inhibition of P-body movement by the GTD domains. In addition, we show that the GTD domain does not inhibit P-body movement when driven by a hybrid myosin in which the GTD domain was replaced by DCP2. These data suggest that the dominant negative effect of myosin tails involves a competition of the GTD domains for cargo binding sites."

The investigation of the number of maneuvers necessary to reach the highest peak of SNIP in pediatric populations has been inconsistent. Thus, this study aimed to assess the reliability of SNIP in healthy children aged 6 to 11 years according to sex and age group, and to determine the optimal number of SNIP maneuvers for this age group.This cross-sectional study included healthy children with normal pulmonary function. We performed 12 to 20 SNIP maneuvers, with a 30 s rest between each maneuver. The reliability was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change (MDC), and Bland-Altman analysis for agreement.A total of 121 healthy children (62 girls [51%]) were included in this study. The ICC and corresponding confidence interval (CI) between the highest measure and the first reproducible maneuver were 0.752 (0.656-0.824), SEM = 10.37 cmH2O, and MDC = 28.74 cmH2O. For children aged 6 to 7 years, the ICC was 0.669 (0.427-0.822), SEM = 10.76 cmH2O and MDC = 29.82 cmH2O; for children aged 8 to 11 years, the ICC was 0.774 (0.662-0.852), SEM = 9.74 cmH2O, and MDC = 26.05 cmH2O. For girls, the ICC was 0.817 (0.706-0.889), SEM = 9.40 cmH2O and MDC = 26.05 cmH2O; for boys, the ICC was 0.671 (0.487-0.798), SEM = 11.51 cmH2O, and MDC = 31.90 cmH2O. Approximately 80% of the total sample reached the highest SNIP before the 10th maneuver.SNIP demonstrated moderate reliability between the maneuvers in children aged 6 to 11 years; older children and girls reached the SNIP peak faster. Finally, results indicated that 12 maneuvers were sufficient for healthy children aged 6 to 11 years to achieve the highest SNIP peak."
https://openalex.org/W3164976690,"The present study identified the active radical species in acidic sodium chlorite and investigated the feasibility of quantifying these species with the diethylphenylenediamine (DPD) method. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used to identify the active species generated in solutions containing sodium chlorite (NaClO2). The ESR signal was directly observed in an acidified sodium chlorite (ASC) aqueous solution at room temperature. This ESR signal was very long-lived, indicating that the radical was thermodynamically stable. The ESR parameters of this signal did not coincide with previously reported values of the chlorine radical (Cl●) or chlorine dioxide radical (O = Cl●-O and O = Cl-O●). We refer to this signal as being from the chloroperoxyl radical (Cl-O-O●). Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the optimal structure of the chloroperoxyl radical is much more thermodynamically stable than that of the chlorine dioxide radical. The UV-visible spectrum of the chloroperoxyl radical showed maximum absorbance at 354 nm. This absorbance had a linear relationship with the chloroperoxyl radical ESR signal intensity. Quantifying the free chlorine concentration by the DPD method also revealed a linear relationship with the maximum absorbance at 354 nm, which in turn showed a linear relationship with the chloroperoxyl radical ESR signal intensity. These linear relationships suggest that the DPD method can quantify chloroperoxyl radicals, which this study considers to be the active species in ASC aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W3165493978,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a feature of aging (termed sarcopenia) and various diseases, such as cancer and kidney failure. Effective drug treatment options for muscle atrophy are lacking. The tapeworm medication, niclosamide is being assessed for repurposing to treat numerous diseases, including end-stage cancer metastasis and hepatic steatosis. In this study, we investigated the potential of niclosamide as a repurposing drug for muscle atrophy. In a myotube atrophy model using the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, niclosamide did not prevent the reduction in myotube diameter or the decreased expression of phosphorylated FOXO3a, which upregulates the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of muscle catabolism. Treatment of normal myotubes with niclosamide did not activate mTOR, a major regulator of muscle protein synthesis, and increased the expression of atrogin-1, which is induced in catabolic states. Niclosamide treatment also inhibited myogenesis in muscle precursor cells, enhanced the expression of myoblast markers Pax7 and Myf5 , and downregulated the expression of differentiation markers MyoD , MyoG and Myh2 . In an animal model of muscle atrophy, niclosamide did not improve muscle mass, grip strength or muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Muscle atrophy is also feature of cancer cachexia. IC 50 analyses indicated that niclosamide was more cytotoxic for myoblasts than cancer cells. In addition, niclosamide did not suppress the induction of iNOS , a key mediator of atrophy, in an in vitro model of cancer cachexia and did not rescue myotube diameter. Overall, these results suggest that niclosamide may not be a suitable repurposing drug for glucocorticoid-induced skeletal muscle atrophy or cancer cachexia. Nevertheless, niclosamide may be employed as a compound to study mechanisms regulating myogenesis and catabolic pathways in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3165869411,"Leptospirosis is an emerging worldwide zoonotic disease, but the general biology of the causative agents is still poorly understood. Humans are an occasional host. The main risk factors are water-associated exposure during professional or recreational activities or during outbreaks in endemic areas. Detecting the presence of pathogenic bacteria in aquatic environments and their capacity to resist various inactivation processes are research fields that need to be further developed. In addition, the methods used for detecting and enumerating Leptospira still need to be improved. We aimed to describe a new quantitative polymerase chain reaction coupled to propidium monoazide treatment (PMAqPCR) that targets not only total Leptospira but also discriminates pathogenic from non-pathogenic Leptospira while also addressing PCR inhibitors, a frequently encountered problem when studying environmental water. In a second step, the killing efficiency of Leptospira to different treatments was tested and PMAqPCR compared to culture-based enumeration. This provided information about the effects of temperature, as well as ultraviolet and chlorine disinfection, that are both related to water treatment processes, in particular for the production of drinking water, on the persistence of both saprophytic and pathogenic Leptospira . Finally, PMAqPCR was used for the detection of Leptospira in freshwater samples for a proof-of-concept. In conclusion, our method could be used for routine freshwater monitoring and allows better evaluation of the presence of Leptospira , allowing evaluation of the bacterial dynamics in a designated area or assessment of the efficacy of water disinfection processes."
https://openalex.org/W3164029006,"Lonicera macranthoides Hand.-Mazz (L. macranthoides) is a medicinal herb that is widely distributed in South China. The developmental stage and corolla dehiscence of the flower are the important factors affecting the quality of medicinal ingredients. However, neither the regulatory mechanism controlling chlorogenic acids biosynthesis in L. macranthoides nor the molecular basis of effect of corolla dehiscence on the quality of medicinal materials is fully understood. In this study, metabolomics and transcriptomics were used to analyze the metabolic and transcriptional differences of two different cultivars closed bud type (Bt), and flowering type (Ft), as well as the effect of jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA) on chlorogenic acids (CGAs) biosynthesis. In total, large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were filtered among three lines of samples. Gene metabolite correlation analyses revealed a 'core set' of 30 genes and 54 genes that were strongly correlated with CGAs biosynthesis and regulating the flowering, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results proved the alterations in the expression levels of genes encoding the pathways involved in CGAs biosynthesis. The ion abundances of CGAs were most significantly increased, while some of the CGAs derived and Caffeoyl-CoA-derived substances showed the most largely reduced abundances in the closed bud type (Bt) compared to the flowering type (Ft). MeJA may leads to the activation of downstream genes in CGAs biosynthesis pathway. Overall, there were significant differences in the transcriptional and metabolic levels of CGAs biosynthesis pathway in flower buds of different flowering cultivars. The redirection of metabolic flux may contribute to increased accumulation of CGAs. However, whether MeJA and flowering have direct effects on the accumulation of CGAs needs further studied. These researches effectively expanded the functional genomic library and provide new insights into CGAs biosynthesis in L. macranthoides."
https://openalex.org/W3164556949,"Cities around the world are transitioning to more efficient lighting schemes, especially retrofitting traditional, high-pressure sodium (HPS) streetlights with light-emitting diode (LED) lights. Although these initiatives aim to address the problems of urban sustainability and save money, the ecological impacts of these retrofits remain poorly understood, especially in brightly lit cities and in the tropics, where urbanisation is most rapid. We performed an experimental study of the retrofit in Singapore-focusing on insectivorous bats, whose activity we monitored acoustically along paired control (HPS-lit) and treatment (LED-lit) streets. We recorded seven species along these streets, but only obtained enough recordings to measure the effect of light type for three of them-all of which can reasonably be described as urban adapters. The strongest predictor of bat activity (an index of habitat use) was rainfall-it has a positive effect. Light type did not influence bat activity or species composition of the bat assemblage along these streets, though it did interact with the effects of rainfall and traffic noise for one bat species. Ultimately, the retrofit may be ecologically meaningless to urban-adapted, tropical insectivores that already experience high levels of light pollution as they do in Singapore. However, while our findings may appear reassuring to those concerned with such retrofits in other tropical and/or brightly-lit cities, they also highlight the contextual nature of ecological impacts. We point out that they should not be prematurely generalised to other locales and systems. In particular, they do not imply no impact on species that are less urban-adapted, and there is a clear need for further studies, for example, on responses of other foraging guilds and of bats (and insects) throughout the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W3164658734,"To compare the immediate response of nursing home residents to dog visits with or without an activity, and the impact of cognitive ability.In a randomly controlled trial, 174 nursing home residents were allocated to 12 bi-weekly 10-minute visits: either ordinary dog visits (D, n = 57, 49 analysed), dog visits with an activity (DA, n = 56, 48 analysed), or visits with activity but no dog (A, n = 61, 54 analysed). We recorded frequency and duration of residents' verbal and physical interactions with the dog and persons. Data were analysed in three periods of four visits (period 1-3) as binomial variables (generalised linear models) or durations (non-parametric statistics).Both visit type and impairment level affected the likelihood of interacting with the dog (D and DA). In some periods increased cognitive impairment lowered odds of touching the dog in DA visits (period 1: F1,85 = 5.17, P < 0.05) and talking to it directly (period 1: F1,90 = 4.60, P < 0.05; period 3: F1,87 = 5.34, P < 0.05). Throughout, residents talked less to persons during DA visits compared to D and A (P = 0.01-0.05), and level of cognitive impairment correlated negatively with talk duration (P < 0.001). Generally, high cognitive impairment level lowered odds of interacting with (period 1: F1,89 = 7.89, P < 0.01; period 2: F1,97 = 6.76, P = 0.01; period 3: F1,92 = 13.57, P < 0.001) and talking about the activities (period 1: F1,89 = 13.78, P <0.001; period 2: F1,88 = 3.27, P = 0.07; period 3: F1,86 = 3.88, P = 0.05).Visits without specific activities stimulated residents to interact with the dog, whereas increasing the complexity of dog visits by adding activities resulted in less interaction with the dog for severely impaired residents. The optimal dog visit for the less cognitively impaired residents could include activities and thereby a possibility to interact with the dog in different ways, whereas for severely impaired residents, just being with the dog seems more appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W3165061415,"Ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) is used to recovery shallow geothermal energy, a widely distributed green energy source. Due to the imbalance between heat rejection and extraction, heat buildup underground is commonly associated with the long-term operation of GCHPs, which undermine system performance. Heat buildup intrinsically results the irreversibilities (entropy production) in subsurface heat sink, in which thermodynamic and transport properties are largely influenced by hydrogeologic properties, especially the existence of fractures and groundwater. This study investigates the influence of water flow in fractures on the thermodynamic performance of a single borehole heat exchanger (BHX) and heat buildup in the underground heat exchange zone (UHXZ). Potential influence factors were screened out, and new terms were proposed to quantify the scale of fractures and available heat and cold in the heat sink. Governing equations were established to calculate the impacts of vertical and horizontal fractures on the heat exchange rate in BHX as well as on the heat flow across the UHXZ. The analysis results show that water flow in fractures can significantly enhance heat transfer, reduce required number of boreholes, mitigate heat buildup and reduce irreversibilities underground. The results also suggest that the role of fracture scales and water velocity in GCHP operation should be carefully evaluated. Therefore, detailed hydrogeological survey is necessary. The study results provide a guide on more accurately evaluating the risk of heat buildup and how to take advantage of hydrogeological characters to improve the performance of GCHPs."

Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) little is known about the weight gain pattern in pregnancy. The purpose of the study is to estimate the average gestational weight gain (GWG) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and to examined whether there had been recent improvements or not.Based on cross-sectional anthropometric data extracted from multiple Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in SSA, we estimated the average GWG in the region. Pseudo-cohort design was used to reconstruct GWG trajectories based on aggregated data of 110,482 women extracted from 30 recent surveys. Trend in GWG between 2000 and 2015 was determined using the data of 11 SSA countries. Pre-pregnancy weight was estimated based on the weight of non-pregnant women at risk of conception.On average, women in SSA gain inadequate weight (6.6 kg, 95% confidence interval, 6.0-7.2) over pregnancy. No meaningful gain was observed in the first trimester; whereas, women in the second and third trimesters put on 2.2 and 3.2 kg, respectively. The highest weight gain (10.5, 8.2-12.9 kg) was observed in Southern African sub-region and the lowest in Western Africa (5.8, 5.0-6.6 kg). The GWG among women who had secondary or above education (9.5, 8.2-10.9 kg) was higher than women with lower education (5.0, 4.3-5.8 kg). Likewise, GWG in women from richest households (9.0, 7.2-10.7 kg) was superior to those from poorest households (6.1, 5.3-7.0 kg). The estimated recent (2015-20) mean GWG (6.6, 5.8-7.4 kg) was not significantly different from what had been at beginning of the new millennium (6.7, 5.9-7.5 kg).In SSA GWG is extremely low and is not showing improvements."
https://openalex.org/W3133980543,"The number of suicides has increased in the last decades in several developed countries. For instance, Spain has experienced a gradual but steady increase in suicides since the 80's and it is currently the leading external cause of death in the country. At the same time, the dualisation of the labor market, with a strong and persistent incidence of temporary contracts, has increased the instability of employment conditions. Both developments have a stronger incidence for individuals with lower levels of education. Therefore, in this paper we use rich administrative data in order to estimate the impact of the wide spread use of temporary contracts on suicides. In order to do that we exploit a reform that liberalised the use of fix-term contracts in Spain in 1984. Our results show strong long-term effects of the reform, which increased the suicide mortality rate of affected cohorts (those entering the labor market just after the liberalisation) by at least 25.3%. We believe that this result has important policy implications and should be taken into account in the design of the national suicide prevention plans."
https://openalex.org/W3164289609,"Outbreaks of avian influenza virus (AIV) infection included the spread of highly pathogenic AIV in commercial poultry and backyard flocks in the spring of 2015. This resulted in estimated losses of more than $8.5 million from federal government expenditures, $1.6 billion from direct losses to produces arising from destroyed turkey and chicken egg production, and economy-wide indirect costs of $3.3 billion from impacts on retailers and the food service industries. Additionally, these outbreaks resulted in the death or depopulation of nearly 50 million domestic birds. Domesticated male ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were trained to display a specific conditioned behavior (i.e. active scratch alert) in response to feces from AIV-infected mallards in comparison to feces from healthy ducks. In order to establish that ferrets were identifying samples based on odors associated with infection, additional experiments controlled for potentially confounding effects, such as: individual duck identity, housing and feed, inoculation concentration, and day of sample collection (post-infection). A final experiment revealed that trained ferrets could detect AIV infection status even in the presence of samples from mallards inoculated with Newcastle disease virus or infectious laryngotracheitis virus. These results indicate that mammalian biodetectors are capable of discriminating the specific odors emitted from the feces of non-infected versus AIV infected mallards, suggesting that the health status of waterfowl can be evaluated non-invasively for AIV infection via monitoring of volatile fecal metabolites. Furthermore, in situ monitoring using trained biodetectors may be an effective tool for assessing population health."
https://openalex.org/W3164293044,"Determining the number of fish that use a fishway is essential to fisheries management but counting all fish can be impracticable due to labor and cost. We present the daily run-size estimation (DARSE) method, which uses systematic sampling to estimate the number of fish per species that pass through a fishway daily (daily run size, D). The DARSE method makes it possible to determine the minimum fraction of each hour (or hourly samples) of the day necessary to estimate D with known accuracy. We apply DARSE to each of the seven most abundant fish species (other species grouped under 'Others') recorded in video images taken during 46 days of one year at the Igarapava Fish Ladder, Brazil. Accuracy in estimating D was influenced by the fraction of the hour sampled and the temporal pattern of fish passage through the fishway. For species with a more uniform temporal pattern of passage, the DARSE method reduced the time spent on sampling by up to 96%, depending on the accuracy used to estimate D. Some of these species required counts of fish that pass in a fraction of an hour for all hours of the day while counts for other species can be done every 2 hours or, more rarely, every 3 hours. For species with a more aggregated temporal pattern of passage, it was possible to estimate D by sampling a fraction of an hour but with reduced accuracy in the estimation of D and little reduction in sampling time."
https://openalex.org/W3165475863,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes both physical disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and altered immune responses that can lead to significant secondary brain injury and chronic inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS). Cell therapies, including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), have been shown to restore BBB integrity and augment endogenous splenic regulatory T cells (Treg), a subset of CD4+ T cells that function to regulate immune responses and prevent autoimmunity. We have recently shown that infusion of human cord blood-derived Treg decreased neuroinflammation after TBI in vivo and in vitro. However, while both cells have demonstrated anti-inflammatory and regenerative potential, they likely utilize differing, although potentially overlapping, mechanisms. Furthermore, studies investigating these two cell types together, as a combination therapy, are lacking. In this study, we compared the ability of Treg+MSC combination therapy, as well as MSC and Treg monotherapies, to improve BBB permeability in vivo and suppress inflammation in vitro. While Treg+MSC combination did not significantly augment potency in vivo, our in vitro data demonstrates that combination therapy may augment therapeutic potency and immunosuppressive potential compared to Treg or MSC monotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3165619461,"Oviposition site selection by herbivores can depend not only on the quality of host resources, but also on the risk of predation, parasitism and interference. Females of the lycaenid butterfly Arhopala bazalus (Lepidoptera) lay eggs primarily on old host foliage away from fresh growth, where larval offspring live and feed. Resource availability of young host leaves seems not to affect the oviposition site preference by the females. To clarify the adaptive significance of A. bazalus oviposition behavior on old foliage, we tested three hypotheses: eggs on fresh foliage are (1) easily dropped during rapid leaf expansion (bottom-up hypothesis), (2) more likely to be attacked by egg parasitoids (top-down hypothesis), and (3) frequently displaced or injured by other herbivores (interference hypothesis). In field surveys, rates of egg dropping and parasitism by egg parasitoids were not significantly different between fresh and old host parts. However, the portions of fresh leaves on which A. bazalus eggs had been laid were cut from shoots on which conspecific larvae fed. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that eggs on young leaves were displaced in the presence of conspecific larvae and we observed that fifth instar larvae actively displaced conspecific eggs by feeding on the surrounding leaf tissue. These findings indicate that eggs laid on fresh leaves are at risk of being displaced by conspecific larvae, and support the interference hypothesis. Larval behavior is a likely evolutionary force for A. bazalus to lay eggs apart from larval feeding sites on the host plant."
https://openalex.org/W3163976502,"The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Gastrointestinal Drug Advisory Committee (GIDAC) is involved in gastrointestinal drug application reviews. Characteristics and conflicts of interest (COI) in GIDAC meetings are not well described. This study analyzed FDA GIDAC meetings and characteristics that predict recommendations.In this cross-sectional study, all publicly available GIDAC meetings where proposed medications were voted on were included. Data were collected regarding indications, medication sponsor, primary efficacy studies, and voting member characteristics (e.g. committee membership, COI). Univariate analyses were conducted at per-meeting and per-vote levels to assess for predictors of committee recommendation and individual votes respectively.Thirty-four meetings with 476 individual votes from 1998-2018 were included. Twenty-three (68%) proposals were recommended for approval and 25 (74%) received FDA approval. Most proposals involved >1 primary study (n = 27, 79%). At least one voting member had a COI in 24 (71%) of 34 meetings. Twelve (35%) meetings had at least one sponsor COI. Among 476 individual votes, 74 (15.5%) involved a COI, with 33 (6.9%) sponsor COI. COI decreased significantly over time, with fewer COI in 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and 2016-2020 compared to 1996-2000 and 2001-2005 (p<0.01). There were no significant associations between pre-defined predictors, including COI, and committee level recommendations or individual votes (p>0.05 for all univariate analyses).The GIDAC reviewed 34 proposals from 1998-2018. The majority were recommended for approval and later approved by the FDA, highlighting the GIDAC's prominence in the regulatory process. COI are present among GIDAC panelists but decreasing over time and not associated with recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W3164182783,"Most aquatic mammals have complex social and communication systems. Interestingly, little is known about otters' vocal communication compared to other aquatic mammals. Here, for the first time, we acoustically describe vocalizations of the neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), a solitary and endangered New World otter species. We recorded vocalizations and behavioral contexts from six captive neotropical otters at Projeto Lontra, Santa Catarina Island, Brazil. Analysis of acoustic parameters were used to classify the vocalizations according to structure and context. We describe six call types with highly tonal as well as chaotic vocalizations with fundamental frequencies ranging from 90 to 2500 Hz. Additionally, we identified sex differences in the usage of calls. Results suggest that the neotropical river otter has a rich vocal repertoire, similar in complexity to other solitary otter species, but less complex than that of the social giant otter. Despite differences in sociality, phylogeny and ecology, L. longicaudis seems to possess vocalizations homologous to those found in other otters (e.g. hah and chirp), suggesting phylogenetic inertia in otter communicative repertoire. Otters thus offer an interesting but neglected group to explore the evolution of communication systems."
https://openalex.org/W3164313469,"We aimed to provide real-world information on survival, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and expenditures related to various first lines of therapy (1LOTs) in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients who were transplant ineligible (TI).From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database (2008-2016), we identified 1,511 NDMM-TI patients who had received 1LOT since June 2012. We categorized 1LOT regimens into four groups: bortezomib (V)+thalidomide (T), V, T, and non-V/T. Patients' characteristics were collected. The overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), frequencies of HCRU (hospitalization, visiting outpatient and emergency departments), and related expenditures within one year after commencement of the 1LOT were evaluated and compared.The mean age of the included patients was 71.3 (SD 10.7) years, and 40.4% of patients had a CCI score ≥3. Most patients (747; 49.4%) were in the V+T group and, after adjusting for covariates, had a significantly longer OS (median, 22.2 months) and EFS (9.1 months) than those in the T group (12.6 and 4.5 months, respectively) and the non-V/T group (12.2 and 3.2 months, respectively), but they were mostly comparable with patients in the V group (23.8 and 6.6 months, respectively). Compared to those in the V+T group, patients in the T and non-V/T groups had 29% and 39% fewer outpatient visits and 15% and 24% lower total expenditure, respectively.Our real-world data consolidate evidence for the effectiveness of bortezomib-containing regimens as the 1LOT in NDMM-TI patients at the expense of more outpatient visits and higher total costs."
https://openalex.org/W3164542343,"Diarrhea in mink kits is a major cause of disease and mortality in the mink production. The etiology remains unknown in most outbreaks due to a lack of diagnostic assays. In the current study we present an RT-qPCR method to detect mink astrovirus in fecal samples from mink kits with diarrhea. All sampled animals were classified based on age and patoanatomical evaluation as having pre-weaning diarrhea, diarrhea in the growth period or as having no macroscopic signs of diarrhea. Fecal samples were analyzed for MiAstV with RT-qPCR, next generation sequencing and electron microscopy in parallel. Mink astrovirus was detected with RT-qPCR in 92 out of 203 samples. This detection was confirmed by next generation sequencing in a high proportion of samples (22/27), and by visualization of astrovirus particles with EM in some of the samples. Mink astrovirus was highly prevalent (68%) among kits in the outbreaks of pre-weaning diarrhea, in particular outbreaks from May, while less prevalent in outbreaks in June. Mink astrovirus was detected in outbreaks of diarrhea in the growth period, though in a much lesser extent than in the pre-weaning period. The role of mink astrovirus in the diarrhea disease complex of mink remain to be investigated, and for that purpose this sensitive and robust RT-qPCR can be a valuable tool in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3164657313,"The withdrawal of aquaculture facilities has an important impact on the aquatic ecosystem of the lakes connected to the Yangtze River. In order to elucidate the response mechanism of metazooplankton to the changes in water environment after the removal of aquaculture facilities, we collected metazooplankton samples and investigated the water environment in the Huayanghe Lakes from the summer of 2018 to the spring of 2019. Aquatic plants recovered quickly, and water eutrophication was relieved, especially in Lake Huangda, followed by Lake Bo. During our study, the highest regional (γ) diversity was 71 in summer, while the lowest was 32 in winter. Species turnover in space (β diversity) varied between 10.01 and 56.52, which was highest in summer. Based on redundancy analysis, environmental factors such as transparency, Chl α, water temperature and water depth, had greatly effects on the metazooplankton community structure. The results showed that the restoration of aquatic plants increased species diversity and metazooplankton density. This study provides a data basis for lakes restoration and a scientific basis for the management and protection of lakes water ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3164826827,"Few studies have assessed the presentation, management, and outcomes of sepsis in low-income countries (LICs). We sought to characterize these aspects of sepsis and to assess mortality predictors in sepsis in two referral hospitals in Rwanda.This was a retrospective cohort study in two public academic referral hospitals in Rwanda. Data was abstracted from paper medical records of adult patients who met our criteria for sepsis.Of the 181 subjects who met eligibility criteria, 111 (61.3%) met our criteria for sepsis without shock and 70 (38.7%) met our criteria for septic shock. Thirty-five subjects (19.3%) were known to be HIV positive. The vast majority of septic patients (92.7%) received intravenous fluid therapy (median = 1.0 L within 8 hours), and 94.0% received antimicrobials. Vasopressors were administered to 32.0% of the cohort and 46.4% received mechanical ventilation. In-hospital mortality for all patients with sepsis was 51.4%, and it was 82.9% for those with septic shock. Baseline characteristic mortality predictors were respiratory rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and known HIV seropositivity.Septic patients in two public tertiary referral hospitals in Rwanda are young (median age = 40, IQR = 29, 59) and experience high rates of mortality. Predictors of mortality included baseline clinical characteristics and HIV seropositivity status. The majority of subjects were treated with intravenous fluids and antimicrobials. Further work is needed to understand clinical and management factors that may help improve mortality in septic patients in LICs."
https://openalex.org/W3165044599,"Obesity is highly prevalent among ethnic minorities and acceptance of larger body sizes may put these ethnic minorities at risk of obesity. This study aimed to examine body size ideals and body satisfaction in relation to body weight, in two Sub-Saharan African (SSA)-origin groups in the Netherlands compared to the Dutch. Additionally, in the two SSA-origin groups, this study assessed the mediating role of acculturation in the relation between ethnicity and body size ideals and body satisfaction.Dutch, African Surinamese and Ghanaians living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, participated in the observational HELIUS study (n = 10,854). Body size ideals were assessed using a validated nine figure scale. Body satisfaction was calculated as the concordance of current with ideal figure. Acculturation was only assessed among SSA-origin participants and acculturation proxies included age of migration, residence duration, ethnic identity and social network. Weight and height were measured using standardised protocols.SSA-origin women and Ghanaian men had larger body size ideals compared to the Dutch; e.g. Surinamese and Ghanaian women had 0.37 (95%CI 0.32; 0.43) and 0.70 (95%CI 0.63; 0.78) larger body size ideals compared to Dutch women. SSA-origin participants were more often satisfied with their weight compared to the Dutch. Similarly, SSA-origin participants had more than twice the odds of being satisfied/preferring a larger figure compared to the Dutch (e.g. BSurinamese men 2.44, 95%CI 1.99; 2.99). Within the two SSA-origin groups, most acculturation proxies mediated the relation between ethnicity and body size ideals in women. Limited evidence of mediation was found for the outcome body satisfaction.Public health strategies promoting a healthy weight may need to be differentiated according to sex and ethnic differences in body weight perception. Factors other than acculturation may underlie the ethnic differences between African Surinamese and Ghanaians in obesity."
