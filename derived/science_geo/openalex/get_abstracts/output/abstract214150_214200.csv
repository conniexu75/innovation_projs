Cigarette smoking has also been observed to be associated with the bitter taste threshold variable2,3. No associations were observed, however, between taste thresholds for hydrochloric acid, sodium chloride, acetic acid and sucrose, on the one hand, and number of foods disliked1 or cigarettes smoked2,3 on the other. This communication records the association between the smoking habits of 31–50-year-old males and females, and their taste thresholds for two bitter-tasting compounds, quinine and 6-n-propylthio-uracil (PROP). The latter is a phenylthiourea (PTC) type compound, taste sensitivity to which is bimodally distributed, consistent with the hypothesis of a simple genetic dichotomy4–6. The ‘heavy cigarette smokers’ smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day, and we compared their thresholds for quinine and PROP with those of non-smokers."

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such pores in the cross-wall of micro-organisms."

https://openalex.org/W1969103746,"SNAILS of the sub-genus Bulinus (Physopsis) are known to be the principal intermediate hosts of Schistosoma haematobium in East Africa. There are several species present, and of these B.(P.) africanus is represented by B.(P.) africanus ovoideus (Bourguignat) which is widely distributed throughout the area. Mandahl-Barth1 suspected that B.(P.) africanus africanus (Krauss), the subspecies found in southern Africa, also occurred in southern Tanganyika. He considered that the description of ‘Physopsis rekawaensis’, from Lake Rukwa in south-west Tanganyika, did not differessentially from the typical B. (P.) africanus africanus. This communication records the finding of B.(P.) africanus africanus along the Little Ruaha River valley near Iringa (altitude 5,500 ft. above sea-level) in the southern highlands of Tanganyika. Dr. Mandahl-Barth kindly identified these snails."

It was contended that peripheral mechanisms subserved this effect."

Also some of these drugs, for example, benzmalecene and triparanol (‘MER-29’), inhibit multiplication of Ochromonas danica, a phytoflagellate; oleic acid annuls this inhibition, but sterols or sterol precursors do not2. Do these drugs inhibit synthesis of ATP in O. danica ? It remains to be seen if there is an especially close relation between ATP synthesis and lipid synthesis."
