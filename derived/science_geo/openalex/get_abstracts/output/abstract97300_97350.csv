https://openalex.org/W1585737027,"Specific sex steroid hormone binding sites have been identified in a discrete nuclear subfraction that is chromatin-depleted and salt-insoluble. This structure, referred to as the nuclear matrix, contains a residual pore complex-lamina, remnants of an internal network, and a residual nucleolus. The nuclear matrix of an estrogen-responsive tissue (chicken liver) and of an androgen target tissue (rat ventral prostate) contains binding sites for estradiol and dihydrotestosterone, respectively. The binding of steroids to these sites is saturable, high affinity (Kd approximately 10(-9) M), steroid-specific (liver binds estrogens, prostate binds androgens), and heat- and pronase-sensitive. The levels of these matrix-associated steroid binding sites change in response to manipulation of the hormonal status of the animal. Thus, the liver nuclear matrix of laying hens contains a significant number of estradiol binding sites, whereas that of untreated chicks or roosters contains very few sites. Treatment of chicks or roosters with a dose of estrogen that stimulates the liver to synthesize vitellogenin leads to a marked increase in the number of estradiol binding sites associated with the liver nuclear matrix. In the rat ventral prostate, the nuclear matrix-associated binding sites for dihydrotestosterone that are present in intact adults essentially disappear within 24 h after castration. Androgen replacement therapy restores, within 1 h, the number of matrix binding sites for dihydrotestosterone to normal levels. Inhibitors of proteolysis (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) are essential for the protection of these androgen binding sites. Conditions that lead to the solubilization of the internal network material of the nuclear matrix also result in the extraction of 70 to 85% of the specific dihydrotestosterone binding sites from the matrix; a limited number of binding sites still remain associated with the peripheral lamina."
https://openalex.org/W1557125148,"The kallikrein substrate H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide was used in a direct spectrophotometric assay for activated Hageman factor (HF). An 80,000-dalton two-chain, disulfide-linked enzyme, termed HFa, and a 28,000-dalton Hageman factor cleavage product, HFf, were not distinguished in this assay and had a Km of 190 microM and kcat of 15/s. Treatment of HF with 10(-2) M diisopropylfluorophosphate yielded preparations containing 0.2 to 0.9% activated HF as assessed in plastic cuvettes. In quartz cuvettes, concave upward progress curves were obtained. Secondary plots of absorbance/time against time were also nonlinear and consistent with an increased rate of formation of activated enzyme. The curves varied with total protein content and synthetic substrate concentration in a manner consistent with autoactivation; increasing synthetic substrate competed with native HF for interaction with activated HF. Accelerated cleavage of surface-bound radiolabeled HF was demonstrated after incubation with HFa but not HFf, indicating that HFa is the form of active enzyme responsible for autocleavage. The autoactivation described herein may provide a sufficient initial concentration of activated HF to initiate the intrinsic coagulation, fibrinolytic, and kinin-forming cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1525939557,"This study describes the regulation of thymidylate synthetase activity in mouse 3T6 fibroblasts during serum-induced transitions between the resting (G0) and growing state. The specific activity of thymidylate synthetase was about 17 times lower in resting 3T6 cells than in exponentially growing cells. When resting cells were serum-stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle, thymidylate synthetase activity remained at the level found in resting cells until 12 h following stimulation (G0-G1 phase), then increased sharply as the cells entered S phase. Enzyme activity increased about 20-fold over that of resting cells by 30 h following stimulation and continued to increase linearly for at least another 30 h. Studies with inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis indicated that the increase in enzyme activity was due to de novo synthesis of the enzyme, and that the increase was controlled at the level of transcription. When cells were stimulated in the presence of inhibitors of DNA synthesis, thymidylate synthetase activity increased in the same manner as in control-stimulated cells. This indicated that the induction of gene expression was not directly coupled to DNA replication. When the serum stimulus was withdrawn during S phase (20 h following stimulation) the cells completed the cell cycle and divided, but then reverted back to the resting state. Thymidylate synthetase activity stopped increasing at about the same time the cells stopped synthesizing DNA, and decreased thereafter with a half-life of 20 to 25 h."

https://openalex.org/W1981997772,"Serotonin infused into the lateral ventricle in rats produced a dose-dependent depression of the acoustic startle reflex. When infused onto the spinal cord, serotonin produced a dose-dependent increase in startle. Thus the same neurotransmitter can modulate the same behavior in opposite ways, depending on which part of the central nervous system is involved."
https://openalex.org/W1598470014,"The synthesis and subsequent assembly of proteoglycan monomer and link protein into aggregates were examined using cultured chondrocytes from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. Proteoglycans purified directly from culture medium after a 6-h label with [14C]serine contained up to 80% of the radioactivity in aggregates, 8% of which was in link protein. The addition of hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides (averaging 50 monosaccharides) to the culture medium during labeling inhibited aggregate formation by 94%. More than 90% of the labeled link molecules (about 7% of the total radioactivity in the proteoglycan fraction) was associated in ternary complexes with monomeric proteoglycan and HA approximately 50. The stoichiometry of labeled link protein to labeled proteoglycan core protein aggregated with either macromolecular hyaluronic acid or hyaluronic acid oligosaccharides was calculated to be 1:1. The effect of exogenous proteoglycan on aggregate formation was examined by incubating cultures for 4 h with up to 5 mg of exogenous monomer. Over this time, about 85 micrograms of newly synthesized proteoglycan accumulated in the culture medium. With increasing amounts of exogenous monomer, up to 80 micrograms of 35S-labeled exogenous monomer was incorporated into link-stabilized aggregate, while the aggregation of endogenous proteoglycan decreased from 73 to 44%. The total endogenous plus exogenous monomer in link-stabilized aggregate increased to about 130 micrograms, approximately 1 1/2 times the total amount of endogenous monomer in the culture medium, indicating that at least 1 1/2 times more link molecules than endogenous proteoglycan molecules were present. Further, the molar ratio of labeled link to labeled monomer molecules associated with the nonaggregated proteoglycan fraction remained constant at approximately 1:1, indicating that the exogenous proteoglycans were ineffective in displacing link molecules from endogenous monomer.link complexes. The data suggest that the formation of proteoglycan aggregates may be a sequential process in which a link.monomer complex forms and this complex subsequently binds to hyaluronic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2094659289,Particles (less than or equal to 5 micrometers) of the potent carcinogen crystalline nickel subsulfide were actively phagocytized by cultures of Syrian hamster embryo cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cells did not take up significant quantities of similar-sized particles of the noncarcinogen amorphous nickel monosulfide. The carcinogenic activity of this and other metal compounds appears to be proportional to their cellular uptake.

All variant clones showed similar susceptibility to cytotoxic effects induced by ultraviolet light."
https://openalex.org/W1539851476,"Purification of a cDNA probe specific for dihydrofolate reductase mRNA has allowed the relative quantification of dihydrofolate reductase gene numbers and mRNA levels between a line of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts sensitive to the antifolate drugs methotrexate and methasquin and sublines which by virtue of their overproduction of the target enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are cross-resistant to these site-specific inhibitors. Previous results have shown that resistant sublines could overproduce one of two molecular weight forms of dihydrofolate reductase, one parental-like (Mr = 21,000) and one nonparental-like (Mr = 20,000), each encoded by a different mRNA present in elevated amounts in resistant cells (Melera, P. W., Wolgemuth, D., Biedler, J. L., and Hession, C. (1980). J. Biol. Chem. 255, 319--322). The cDNA-RNA and cDNA-DNA hybridization experiments reported here confirm the elevated levels of dihydrofolate reductase-specific mRNA in resistant cells and show that the overproduction of either molecular weight form of dihydrofolate reductase is accompanied by amplification in dihydrofolate reductase gene number."

https://openalex.org/W1499453342,"The formyl peptide chemotactic receptor present on human neutrophil membranes has been covalently affinity-labeled using three different techniques. N-Formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-125I-Tyr-Lys was cross-linked to the receptor with dimethyl suberimidate, N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-125I-Tyr-Lys-Nepsilon-4-azido-2-nitrophenyl was cross-linked by photoactivation, and N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-125I-Tyr-Lys-Nepsilon-bromoacetyl reacted spontaneously with the receptor. With each method, a polypeptide which migrated as a broad band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, with an apparent molecular weight between 55,000 and 70,000, was specifically labeled. A dose-response curve for inhibition of covalent cross-linking of the formyl peptide derivatives by unlabeled N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys correlated closely with a dose-response curve for inhibition of binding of the same formyl peptide derivatives to the receptor. The nonformylated analog, Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys, did not inhibit binding or covalent cross-linking."
https://openalex.org/W2091641603,"In the 17 April issue, Doolittle and Sapienza and Orgel and Crick separately used the term ‘Selfish DNA’ to describe certain DNA sequences in eukaryotic organisms. They argued that the process of DNA replication allows the accumulation within the replicating genome of DNA sequences which have no functional (phenotypic) significance but whose presence stimulates the further accumulation of sequences of the same kind. This ‘selfish’ DNA is supposed, in particular, to account for some of the apparently functionless DNA in the genomes of higher organisms. The two articles have stimulated a great deal of comment, some of which appears below. The original authors will reply at a later stage."

https://openalex.org/W2062945882,"Accurate measurements of intracellular calcium activities in salivary gland epithelial cells of the insect Phormia regina were obtained with microelectrodes in which N,N'-di(11-ethoxycarbonyl)undecyl-N,N'-4,5-tetramethyl-3,6-dioxaoctane diacid diamide wsa incorporated in a liquid membrane system. When calibrated in solutions approximating the ionic concentration of the cell interior, these microelectrodes gave rapid stable responses that were linear functions of the logarithm of calcium activities and were not affected by potassium, sodium and magnesium. Continuous monitoring of calcium activities during serotonin-induced saliva release provided direct evidence of hormonal influence on transmembrane calcium movement and spontaneous regulation of intracellular calcium by stimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2004554220,"Messenger RNA coding for acetylcholine receptor peptides has been identified. This polyadenylate [poly(A)+] RNA from Torpedo californica directs, in a cell-free system, the synthesis of peptides 60,000, 51,000, 49,000 41,000, and 35,000 daltons which account for approximately 2 percent of the total synthesized proteins. The results suggest that several different messenger RNA's code for the receptor subunits. These proteins react specifically to antiserum to native acteylcholine receptor, suggesting that the primary translational product has conformational features similar to the native receptor. Further, the results support the idea that there is post-translational modification of receptor subunits as the molecular weights of the cell-free synthesized proteins differ from those of purified receptor subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1487599041,"The combination of alpha-tocopherolquinone and alpha-tocopherolquinol varied in tissues of the rat from 20 nmol/g of adipose tissue to 215 nmol/g of liver. In each tissue except the brain, the alpha-tocopherolquinone and alpha-tocopherolquinol were about equal. In the brain, the level of the hydroquinone was more than 5 times the level of the quinone. Neither compound was detected in blood. Both [2-14C5mevalonic acid and L-[14C]tyrosine were incorporated into alpha-tocopherolquinone but not into alpha-tocopherol. This indicates that alpha-tocopherol is not the precursor of alpha-tocopherolquinone. In the presence of beta-hydroxybutyrate, pyruvate, succinate, and NADH, alpha-tocopherolquinone was reduced to alpha-tocopherolquinol by liver mitochondria. Since the reduction was not inhibited by rotenone or antimycin A, it is likely that the reduction of alpha-tocopherolquinone is not part of the classical mitochondrial electron transport system."

https://openalex.org/W1488098727,"Antibodies to colchicine have been prepared by injecting rabbits with an antigen prepared by coupling deacetylcolchicine to bovine serum albumin with a water-soluble carbodiimide. Sera of high titer were obtained with apparent dissociation constants for colchicine ranging from 5 to 17 nM. Binding was rapid and occurred at low temperatures. The chemical specificity of the binding site(s) resembled that in tubulin for the A and B rings of colchicine. Unlike tubulin, the antibody binding site tolerated numerous changes in the tropolone moiety (C ring). In contrast to tubulin, binding of colchicine to the antibody site did not promote fluorescence. The colchicine binding capacity of the antibody was high enough to prevent colchicine fluorescence in the presence of tubulin and to restore polymerization in colchicine-inhibited tubulin preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1538810654,"Abstract Reaction of phenylglyoxal, a reagent specific for arginine residues, with porcine phospholipiase A2 results in complete elimination of catalytic activity. The modification reaction is markedly dependent on pH. Other dicarbonyl compounds such as 2,3-butanedione and 1,2-cyclohexanedione also react with the enzyme to cause loss of activity but at significantly slower rates. At pH 7.0, the inactivation can be slightly retarded in the presence of Ca2+ and almost completely prevented in the presence of n-alkylphosphorylchline inhibitors. At pH 8.5, the n-alkylphosphorylcholine inhibitors are less effective. The decrease in enzymatic activity correlates with the modification of about 1 arginine residue/phospholipase A2 molecule. The data suggest that the arginine is involved in the binding of the phosphate portion of the substrate to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1516848018,"Mixed yeast elongator-tRNAs (bulk tRNA lacking fRNAm,fMet), pure isoaccepting species of elongator-tRNAs (tRNAmMet and tRNAPhe), and purified initiator-tRNA (tRNAfMet) were each oxidized with periodate and the 3' terminus was coupled to Sepharose 4B through an adipic acid dihydrazide spacer. The rat liver ribosomal proteins that associated with the tRNAs were isolated by affinity chromatography and identified by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. The rat liver ribosomal proteins that were bound to the elongator-tRNA preparations were L6, L35a, and S15; small amounts of a number of other proteins also associated with the nucleic acid. When initiator-tRNA (tRNAfMet) was immobilized on Sepharose, only L6 and L35a were bound; no 40 S subunit proteins associated with initiator-tRNA. No Escherichia coli proteins formed a complex with either eukaryotic initiator- or elongator-tRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2012141426,"Stage-specific changes in histone synthesis during sea urchin development reflect the expression of different sets of genes. The three kinds of blastomeres formed at the 16-cell stage are the earliest ""determined"" cells and fall into three distinct size classes. At this stage that cells synthesize only ""early"" histones. Such blastomeres can survive and divide in culture after being separated from the embryo, whether or not they are permitted to aggregate. With or without reaggregation, cultured progeny cells of each type of isolated blastomere perform the same changeover of histone synthesis as takes place in the intact embryo, that is, they begin spontaneously to synthesize a new set, the ""late"" histone variants. Normal contact relations among cells of the embryo are, therefore, not required for this programmed change in gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1616681780,"Synthesis of rat liver histidase is under multihormonal control; estrogen, glucocorticoid, and glucagon, via cAMP, induce this enzyme. By means of in vivo [3H]leucine incorporation into immunoprecipitated histidase, relative to that incorporated into total soluble protein, we have now demonstrated that de novo hepatic histidase synthesis, as well as catalytic activity, is selectively increased following hypophysectomy. Treatment of hypophysectomized rats with physiological levels of triiodothyronine (T3) diminished histidase synthetic rates and catalytic activities to normal levels, despite concomitant elevation in total soluble protein synthesis. Thyrotoxic doses of T3 further reduced histidase synthesis to barely measurable rates. Since thyroid hormone is under pituitary regulation, this hormone may be primary in the hypophyseal suppression of histidase. Estrogen does not induce hepatic histidase in the hypophysectomized rat. However, administration of the histidase suppressor, T3, or prolactin, which in itself has no effect on this enzyme, was ineffective in reinstating estrogen inducibility of histidase in the hypophysectomized animal. Thus, some as yet unknown hypophyseal agent is required for estrogenic inducibility of this liver enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1482448094,"11-Deoxy-[21-3H]corticosterone ([21-3H]DOC) exchanged tritium with water in a reaction mediated by an enzyme preparation obtained from hamster liver. Both (21S)-[21-3H]- and (21R)-[21-3H]DOC participated in the exchange. Incorporation of tritium into water followed a hyperbolic path with time for the 21S epimer and a sigmoidal path for the 21R epimer. Separate enzymes did not appear to be involved. The system was also studied by measuring incorporation of deuterium from deuterated water into the steroid side chain. During incubation, DOC containing 2, 1, and no deuteria were all found. Their proportions changed with incubation time. The deuterium atoms were incorporated into the side chain sequentially and reversibly. It is proposed that (21S)-[21-3H]DOC directly exchanges tritium with water in a reaction catalyzed by an isomerase, and (21R)-[21-3H]DOC loses tritium only after prior enzyme-mediated epimerization to the 21S form. We had previously presented evidence that the isomerase reversibly converted the ketol side chain to the aldol form. Epimerization of the aldol isomer, 20 beta-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-en-21-al (isoDOC) by hamster liver enzyme to the 20 alpha-hydroxy isomer was shown directly. A model is presented which accounts for the kinetics of exchange of (21R)- and (21S)-[21-3H]DOC with water, interconversion of DOC and isoDOC, and the epimerization of isoDOC at C-20."

https://openalex.org/W1606494852,"The H3.H4 complex has been extracted from calf thymus chromatin in either 0.05 M NaOAc, pH 5.0, or in 2.0 M KCl, 0.1 M KPO4, pH 6.7, and both forms have been shown to consist solely of histones H3 and H4 when examined on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Serological and circular dichroism analyses indicate the existence of structural differences between the two forms. Dilution of the high salt form of the complex into low salt produces a time-dependent conformational change which is related to reduction in the alpha helix content of the complex and which exposes antigenic sites on the complex. The existence of multiple forms of the H3.H4 complex may be related to the dynamic equilibrium of nucleosome structure in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1607523556,"Ethanolamine ammonia-lyase catalyzes the adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl)-dependent deamination of 1-amino-3-propanol (isopropanolamine) to acetone and NH3. During the course of the reaction a hydrogen is transferred from the carbinol carbon of the substrate to one of the methyl carbons of the product, the cofactor serving as intermediate hydrogen carrier. This result, together with previous results obtained with this and other AdoCbl-requiring enzymes, suggests that an initial step in the catalytic mechanism is the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the substrate to produce the 1-amino-2-hydroxyprop-2-yl radical. This is a bulky species which for steric reasons is unlikely to alkylate cob(II)alamin. Thus, an organocobalamin formed by a reaction between the substrate radical and cob(II)alanin is probably not involved in the mechanism of deamination of isopropanolamine by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase."
https://openalex.org/W1980700953,"The federal government is the single most important determinant of the extent of vaccine research, development, and use in the United States. Federal actions having a positive effect include the finacing of vaccine research and development and of major public immunization programs. Federal policies that may be contributing to a decline in the private sector's commitment to vaccine development include an unwillingness to resolve certain liability issues. The nation depends heavily on vaccines to prevent several childhood diseases. For that and other reasons, decisive government efforts are needed to help stimulate the creation of new vaccines and to ensure the continued supply and use of existing safe and efficacious vaccines."
