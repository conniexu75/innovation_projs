https://openalex.org/W2069519142,"Statistical dependencies in the responses of sensory neurons govern both the amount of stimulus information conveyed and the means by which downstream neurons can extract it. Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40% more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons."

Semiconductors made from organic small molecules and polymers have shown promise in such applications, but a new carbon-based nanomaterial described in this issue — its creators say — promises higher performance in electronic applications than the currently available options. Cao et al. have developed small- to medium-scale integrated digital circuits consisting of random networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes on plastic substrates. The layouts enable both high mobilities and high on/off ratios and the resulting devices and circuits (consisting of up to 100 transistors) show excellent electronic properties. These new films should be of use for a wide range of applications such as unusual consumer electronic devices, biological sensing and optoelectronics. The ability to form integrated circuits on flexible sheets of plastic enables attributes (for example conformal and flexible formats and lightweight and shock resistant construction) in electronic devices that are difficult or impossible to achieve with technologies that use semiconductor wafers or glass plates as substrates1. Organic small-molecule and polymer-based materials represent the most widely explored types of semiconductors for such flexible circuitry2. Although these materials and those that use films or nanostructures of inorganics have promise for certain applications, existing demonstrations of them in circuits on plastic indicate modest performance characteristics that might restrict the application possibilities. Here we report implementations of a comparatively high-performance carbon-based semiconductor consisting of sub-monolayer, random networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes to yield small- to medium-scale integrated digital circuits, composed of up to nearly 100 transistors on plastic substrates. Transistors in these integrated circuits have excellent properties: mobilities as high as 80 cm2 V-1 s-1, subthreshold slopes as low as 140 m V dec-1, operating voltages less than 5 V together with deterministic control over the threshold voltages, on/off ratios as high as 105, switching speeds in the kilohertz range even for coarse (∼100-μm) device geometries, and good mechanical flexibility—all with levels of uniformity and reproducibility that enable high-yield fabrication of integrated circuits. Theoretical calculations, in contexts ranging from heterogeneous percolative transport through the networks to compact models for the transistors to circuit level simulations, provide quantitative and predictive understanding of these systems. Taken together, these results suggest that sub-monolayer films of single-walled carbon nanotubes are attractive materials for flexible integrated circuits, with many potential areas of application in consumer and other areas of electronics."

https://openalex.org/W2052986082,"A Caltech team has discovered that a cocktail of three small molecules at low concentrations acts as the sex pheromone in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas at higher concentration two of these compounds induce a dormant larval state known as the dauer stage. Both sexual reproduction and dauer formation, a population control mechanism that increases larval lifespan and resilience, are major life history traits. The discovery that they are regulated by largely overlapping families of small molecules suggests an intimate linkage between these aspects of C. elegans life cycle, and relates to the general observation that, for many organisms, changes in fecundity and lifespan are inversely correlated. In many organisms, population-density sensing and sexual attraction rely on small-molecule-based signalling systems1,2. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, population density is monitored through specific glycosides of the dideoxysugar ascarylose (the ‘ascarosides’) that promote entry into an alternative larval stage, the non-feeding and highly persistent dauer stage3,4. In addition, adult C. elegans males are attracted to hermaphrodites by a previously unidentified small-molecule signal5,6. Here we show, by means of combinatorial activity-guided fractionation of the C. elegans metabolome, that the mating signal consists of a synergistic blend of three dauer-inducing ascarosides, which we call ascr#2, ascr#3 and ascr#4. This blend of ascarosides acts as a potent male attractant at very low concentrations, whereas at the higher concentrations required for dauer formation the compounds no longer attract males and instead deter hermaphrodites. The ascarosides ascr#2 and ascr#3 carry different, but overlapping, information, as ascr#3 is more potent as a male attractant than ascr#2, whereas ascr#2 is slightly more potent than ascr#3 in promoting dauer formation7. We demonstrate that ascr#2, ascr#3 and ascr#4 are strongly synergistic, and that two types of neuron, the amphid single-ciliated sensory neuron type K (ASK) and the male-specific cephalic companion neuron (CEM), are required for male attraction by ascr#3. On the basis of these results, male attraction and dauer formation in C. elegans appear as alternative behavioural responses to a common set of signalling molecules. The ascaroside signalling system thus connects reproductive and developmental pathways and represents a unique example of structure- and concentration-dependent differential activity of signalling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2163002796,"Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB)-regulated inflammatory genes, such as TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), play key roles in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. However, the nuclear chromatin mechanisms are unclear. We report here that the chromatin histone H3-lysine 4 methyltransferase, SET7/9, is a novel coactivator of NF-kappaB. Gene silencing of SET7/9 with small interfering RNAs in monocytes significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory genes and histone H3-lysine 4 methylation on these promoters, as well as monocyte adhesion to endothelial or smooth muscle cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that SET7/9 small interfering RNA could reduce TNF-alpha-induced recruitment of NF-kappaB p65 to inflammatory gene promoters. Inflammatory gene induction by ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation end products was also attenuated in SET7/9 knockdown monocytes. In addition, we also observed increased inflammatory gene expression and SET7/9 recruitment in macrophages from diabetic mice. Microarray profiling revealed that, in TNF-alpha-stimulated monocytes, the induction of 25% NF-kappaB downstream genes, including the histone H3-lysine 27 demethylase JMJD3, was attenuated by SET7/9 depletion. These results demonstrate a novel role for SET7/9 in inflammation and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2029729041,"Copper is an important cofactor for several enzymes. In order to be loaded onto endomembrane proteins, it is translocated from the cytosol by the copper transporters ATP7A or ATP7B. It is thought that proteins acquire copper upon transit through the trans Golgi network. Setty et al. study copper transport in pigment forming cells, mouse melanocytes. The enzyme tyrosinase catalyses melanin synthesis in melanosomes and requires copper for its activity. They find that while tyrosinase acquires copper within the trans Golgi network, it is inefficient and is lost within intermediate trafficking vesicles. Tyrosinase is subsequently reloaded with copper only when it reaches melanocytes by the copper transporter ATP7A. This provides a system for cell type specific spatial control of metalloenzyme activity and prevents aberrant activation of tyrosinase during transport. Copper is a cofactor for many cellular enzymes and transporters1. It can be loaded onto secreted and endomembrane cuproproteins by translocation from the cytosol into membrane-bound organelles by ATP7A or ATP7B transporters, the genes for which are mutated in the copper imbalance syndromes Menkes disease and Wilson disease, respectively2. Endomembrane cuproproteins are thought to incorporate copper stably on transit through the trans-Golgi network, in which ATP7A accumulates3 by dynamic cycling through early endocytic compartments4. Here we show that the pigment-cell-specific cuproenzyme tyrosinase acquires copper only transiently and inefficiently within the trans-Golgi network of mouse melanocytes. To catalyse melanin synthesis, tyrosinase is subsequently reloaded with copper within specialized organelles called melanosomes. Copper is supplied to melanosomes by ATP7A, a cohort of which localizes to melanosomes in a biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1)-dependent manner. These results indicate that cell-type-specific localization of a metal transporter is required to sustain metallation of an endomembrane cuproenzyme, providing a mechanism for exquisite spatial control of metalloenzyme activity. Moreover, because BLOC-1 subunits are mutated in subtypes of the genetic disease Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome, these results also show that defects in copper transporter localization contribute to hypopigmentation, and hence perhaps other systemic defects, in Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W1973065303,"Monolayers on crystalline surfaces often form complex structures with physical and chemical properties that differ strongly from those of their bulk phases. Such hetero-epitactic overlayers are currently used in nanotechnology and understanding their growth mechanism is important for the development of new materials and devices. In comparison with crystals, quasicrystalline surfaces exhibit much larger structural and chemical complexity leading, for example, to unusual frictional, catalytical or optical properties. Deposition of thin films on such substrates can lead to structures that may have typical quasicrystalline properties. Recent experiments have indeed showed 5-fold symmetries in the diffraction pattern of metallic layers adsorbed on quasicrystals. Here we report a real-space investigation of the phase behaviour of a colloidal monolayer interacting with a quasicrystalline decagonal substrate created by interfering five laser beams. We find a pseudomorphic phase that shows both crystalline and quasicrystalline structural properties. It can be described by an archimedean-like tiling consisting of alternating rows of square and triangular tiles. The calculated diffraction pattern of this phase is in agreement with recent observations of copper adsorbed on icosahedral Al(70)Pd(21)Mn(9) surfaces. In addition to establishing a link between archimedean tilings and quasicrystals, our experiments allow us to investigate in real space how single-element monolayers can form commensurate structures on quasicrystalline surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2102935340,"Wounds in the oral cavity heal much faster than skin lesions. Among other factors, saliva is generally assumed to be of relevance to this feature. Rodent saliva contains large amounts of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). In humans, however, the identity of the involved compounds has remained elusive, especially since EGF and NGF concentrations are approximately 100,000 times lower than those in rodent saliva. Using an in vitro model for wound closure, we examined the properties of human saliva and the fractions that were obtained from saliva by high-performance liquid chromotography (HPLC) separation. We identified histatin 1 (Hst1) and histatin 2 (Hst2) as major wound-closing factors in human saliva. In contrast, the d-enantiomer of Hst2 did not induce wound closure, indicating stereospecific activation. Furthermore, histatins were actively internalized by epithelial cells and specifically used the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway, thereby enhancing epithelial migration. This study demonstrates that members of the histatin family, which up to now were implicated in the antifungal weaponry of saliva, exert a novel function that likely is relevant for oral wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2163780400,"The differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts is a crucial step in bone formation. However, the mechanisms involved in the early stages of osteogenic differentiation are not well understood. In this study, we identified FHL2, a member of the LIM-only subclass of the LIM protein superfamily, that is up-regulated during early osteoblast differentiation induced by dexamethasone in murine and human MSCs. Gain-of-function studies showed that FHL2 promotes the expression of the osteoblast transcription factor Runx2, alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, as well as in vitro extracellular matrix mineralization in murine and human mesenchymal cells. Knocking down FHL2 using sh-RNA reduces basal and dexamethasone-induced osteoblast marker gene expression in MSCs. We demonstrate that FHL2 interacts with beta-catenin, a key player involved in bone formation induced by Wnt signaling. FHL2-beta-catenin interaction potentiates beta-catenin nuclear translocation and TCF/LEF transcription, resulting in increased Runx2 and alkaline phosphatase expression, which was inhibited by the Wnt inhibitor DKK1. Reduction of Runx2 transcriptional activity using a mutant Runx2 results in inhibition of FHL2-induced alkaline phosphatase expression in MSCs. These findings reveal that FHL2 acts as an endogenous activator of mesenchymal cell differentiation into osteoblasts and mediates osteogenic differentiation induced by dexamethasone in MSCs through activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling- dependent Runx2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2003286069,"Doñana National Park (DNP) in southern Spain is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve where commercial hunting and wildlife artificial feeding do not take place and traditional cattle husbandry still exists. Herein, we hypothesized that Mycobacterium bovis infection prevalence in wild ungulates will depend on host ecology and that variation in prevalence will reflect variation in the interaction between hosts and environmental risk factors. Cattle bTB reactor rates increased in DNP despite compulsory testing and culling of infected animals. In this study, 124 European wild boar, 95 red deer, and 97 fallow deer were sampled from April 2006 to April 2007 and analyzed for M. bovis infection. Modelling and GIS were used to identify risk factors and intra and inter-species relationships. Infection with M. bovis was confirmed in 65 (52.4%) wild boar, 26 (27.4%) red deer and 18 (18.5%) fallow deer. In the absence of cattle, wild boar M. bovis prevalence reached 92.3% in the northern third of DNP. Wild boar showed more than twice prevalence than that in deer (p<0.001). Modelling revealed that M. bovis prevalence decreased from North to South in wild boar (p<0.001) and red deer (p<0.01), whereas no spatial pattern was evidenced for fallow deer. Infection risk in wild boar was dependent on wild boar M. bovis prevalence in the buffer area containing interacting individuals (p<0.01). The prevalence recorded in this study is among the highest reported in wildlife. Remarkably, this high prevalence occurs in the absence of wildlife artificial feeding, suggesting that a feeding ban alone would have a limited effect on wildlife M. bovis prevalence. In DNP, M. bovis transmission may occur predominantly at the intra-species level due to ecological, behavioural and epidemiological factors. The results of this study allow inferring conclusions on epidemiological bTB risk factors in Mediterranean habitats that are not managed for hunting purposes. Our results support the need to consider wildlife species for the control of bTB in cattle and strongly suggest that bTB may affect animal welfare and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2131112743,"The heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein contains four nucleotide-binding domains referred to as AAA1-AAA4, with the first domain (AAA1) being the main ATP hydrolytic site. Although previous studies have proposed regulatory roles for AAA3 and AAA4, the role of ATP hydrolysis at these sites remains elusive. Here, we have analyzed the single molecule motility properties of yeast cytoplasmic dynein mutants bearing mutations that prevent ATP hydrolysis at AAA3 or AAA4. Both mutants remain processive, but the AAA4 mutant exhibits a surprising increase in processivity due to its tighter affinity for microtubules. In addition to changes in motility characteristics, AAA3 and AAA4 mutants produce less maximal force than wild-type dynein. These results indicate that the nucleotide binding state at AAA3 and AAA4 can allosterically modulate microtubule binding affinity and affect dynein processivity and force production."
https://openalex.org/W2039821208,"Quasars are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes accreting surrounding gas. Central to this picture is a putative accretion disk which is believed to be the source of the majority of the radiative output. It is well known, however, that the most extensively studied disk model-an optically thick disk which is heated locally by the dissipation of gravitational binding energy-is apparently contradicted by observations in a few major respects. In particular, the model predicts a specific blue spectral shape asymptotically from the visible to the near-infrared, but this is not generally seen in the visible wavelength region where the disk spectrum is observable. A crucial difficulty has been that, towards the infrared, the disk spectrum starts to be hidden under strong, hot dust emission from much larger but hitherto unresolved scales, and thus has essentially been impossible to observe. Here we report observations of polarized light interior to the dust-emitting region that enable us to uncover this near-infrared disk spectrum in several quasars. The revealed spectra show that the near-infrared disk spectrum is indeed as blue as predicted. This indicates that, at least for the outer near-infrared-emitting radii, the standard picture of the locally heated disk is approximately correct."
https://openalex.org/W1981209954,"Insulin increases glucose uptake into muscle by enhancing the surface recycling of GLUT4 transporters. In myoblasts, insulin signals bifurcate downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase into separate Akt and Rac/actin arms. Akt-mediated Rab-GAP AS160 phosphorylation and Rac/actin are required for net insulin gain of GLUT4, but the specific steps (vesicle recruitment, docking or fusion) regulated by Rac, actin dynamics, and AS160 target Rab8A are unknown. In L6 myoblasts expressing GLUT4myc, blocking vesicle fusion by tetanus toxin cleavage of VAMP2 impeded GLUT4myc membrane insertion without diminishing its build-up at the cell periphery. Conversely, actin disruption by dominant negative Rac or Latrunculin B abolished insulin-induced surface and submembrane GLUT4myc accumulation. Expression of non-phosphorylatable AS160 (AS160-4P) abrogated membrane insertion of GLUT4myc and partially reduced its cortical build-up, an effect magnified by selective Rab8A knockdown. We propose that insulin-induced actin dynamics participates in GLUT4myc vesicle retention beneath the membrane, whereas AS160 phosphorylation is essential for GLUT4myc vesicle-membrane docking/fusion and also contributes to GLUT4myc cortical availability through Rab8A."
https://openalex.org/W2080851578,"The human MOCS3 gene encodes a protein involved in activation and sulfuration of the C terminus of MOCS2A, the smaller subunit of the molybdopterin (MPT) synthase. MPT synthase catalyzes the formation of the dithiolene group of MPT that is required for the coordination of the molybdenum atom in the last step of molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis. The two-domain protein MOCS3 catalyzes both the adenylation and the subsequent generation of a thiocarboxylate group at the C terminus of MOCS2A by its C-terminal rhodanese-like domain (RLD). The low activity of MOCS3-RLD with thiosulfate as sulfur donor and detailed mutagenesis studies showed that thiosulfate is most likely not the physiological sulfur source for Moco biosynthesis in eukaryotes.

In this report, we investigated the involvement of the human l-cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 in sulfur transfer to MOCS3-RLD. A variant of Nfs1 was purified in conjunction with Isd11 in a heterologous expression system in Escherichia coli, and the kinetic parameters of the purified protein were determined. By studying direct protein-protein interactions, we were able to show that Nfs1 interacted specifically with MOCS3-RLD and that sulfur is transferred from l-cysteine to MOCS3-RLD via an Nfs1-bound persulfide intermediate.

Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). A less abundant isoform generated by initiation of translation at the second in-frame AUG lacks the first 60 residues of the mitochondrial precursor form, and this 44-kDa protein resides both in the cytosol and in the nucleus (19Land T. Rouault T.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).Recently, the Isd11 protein was identified to be essential for FeS cluster biosynthesis in mitochondria and it was shown that Isd11 forms a complex with Nfs1 (24Adam A.C. Bornhovd C. Prokisch H. Neupert W. Hell K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Wiedemann N. Urzica E. Guiard B. Müller H. Lohaus C. Meyer H.E. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Isd11 is suggested to function as an adapter and stabilizer of Nfs1 (26Shan Y. Napoli E. Cortopassi G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 929-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Homologues of Isd11 have been identified in plant, fungi and animal genomes, which contain mitochondria, but no prokaryotic homologue has been identified (27Richards T.A. van der Giezen M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2006; 23: 1341-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).To analyze whether Nfs1 acts as sulfur donor for the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor, we purified an N-terminal-truncated version of Nfs1 after heterologous expression in E. coli in the presence and absence of Isd11. The l-cysteine desulfurase activity of the purified Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 complex was characterized. Nfs1Δ1–55 was shown to interact with both Isd11 and MOCS3-RLD, and in addition, the interaction with MOCS3-RLD was stronger when Nfs1Δ1–55 was not in a complex with Isd11. By ESI-MS analyses it was verified that the sulfur from Nfs1 is further transferred to form a persulfide on MOCS3-RLD. Our studies suggest that cytosolic Nfs1 has an additional role in the cytosol and sulfurates MOCS3 for the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Growth Conditions—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells or BL21(DE3)star cells (Novagen) were used for heterologous expression of the human Nfs1Δ1–55 and Isd11 proteins. The vectors pET15b and pACYCDuet-1 were obtained from Novagen. E. coli expression cultures were grown in LB medium under aerobic conditions at 16 °C for 16 h. Ampicillin (150 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml), and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (100 μm) were used when required.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human Nfs1 and Isd11—For expression of Nfs1, primers were designed that resulted in a deletion of the first 55 amino acids of Nfs1 and that allowed cloning into the XhoI-BamHI sites of the expression vector pET15b. The resulting plasmid was designated pZM2, and expresses Nfs1Δ1–55 as an N-terminal fusion protein with a His6 tag. For coexpression with Isd11, the Isd11 cDNA fragment was cloned from a human cDNA library. Primers were designed that allowed cloning of Isd11 into the NcoI-HindIII sites of the expression vector pACYCDuet-1. The resulting plasmid was designated pZM4. For separate purification of Isd11, primers were designed that allowed cloning of Isd11 into the XhoI-BamHI sites of the expression vector pET15b. The resulting plasmid was designated pZM6, and expresses Isd11 as an N-terminal fusion protein with a His6 tag.For purification of Nfs1Δ1–55, plasmid pZM2 was cotransformed with a plasmid containing the E. coli chaperonin GroEL (6Leimkühler S.

For heterologous expression of Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 in E. coli, pZM2 and pZM4 were cotransformed into BL21(DE3)star cells. Cells were grown at 30 °C in 1-liter cultures of LB containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The expression was induced at A600 nm = 0.6 with 100 μm IPTG. Growth was continued for 16 h at 16 °C, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g. After cell lysis, the soluble fraction was transferred onto a column with Ni-nitrilotriacetic (Ni-NTA, Qiagen). Nfs1Δ1–55 or Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 were eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole buffer, pH 8.0, containing 50 μm PLP and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Final purification of Nfs1Δ1–55 or Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 was achieved by chromatography on a Superose 12 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 10 μm PLP, pH 8.0.For expression of Isd11, pZM6 was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cells were grown at 30 °C in 1-liter cultures of LB, containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin. The expression was induced at A600 nm = 0.6 with 100 μm IPTG. Growth was continued for 16 h at 16 °C, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g. After cell lysis, the soluble fraction was transferred onto a column with Ni-NTA. Isd11 was eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole buffer, pH 8.0. Final purification of Isd11 was achieved by chromatography on a Superose 12 size exclusion column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 9.0.Size Exclusion Chromatography—Purified Nfs1Δ1–55 or Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 were injected in a volume of 500 μl onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0.Enzyme Assays, Molar Extinction Coefficient, and Absorption Spectra of Nfs1Δ1–55—l-Cysteine desulfurase activity of Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 was quantified by the methylene blue method (28Fogo J.K. Popowsky M. Anal Chem. 1949; 21: 732-734Crossref Scopus (358) Google Scholar) using the parameters from Urbina et al. (29Urbina H.D. Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44521-44526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures in a total volume of 0.8 ml contained 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 10 μm PLP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, and 2 μm of Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11. The reactions were initiated by the addition of l-cysteine (0.1–1.0 mm) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before the reactions were stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 20 mm N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine in 7.2 m HCl and 100 μl of 30 mm FeCl3 in 1.2 m HCl. After an incubation time of 15 min, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred to cuvettes and methylene blue was determined at 670 nm. The standard curve was recorded with sodium sulfide. Nfs1Δ1–55 concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 420 nm using the extinction coefficient of 10.9 mm–1 cm–1 for the native enzyme. The extinction coefficient was determined on the basis of the PLP content after alkaline denaturation described after the method of Peterson and Sober (30Peterson E.A. Sober H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 169-175Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar).The reduction spectrum of 9 μm Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 or 2 μm Nfs1Δ1–55 were recorded in the presence of 10 mm l-cysteine in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 at room temperature using a UV-2401PC Shimadzu spectrometer.Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements—All binding experiments were performed with the SPR-based instrument Biacore™ 2000 on CM5 sensor chips at a temperature of 25 °C and a flow rate of 10 μl/min, using the control software 2.1 and evaluation software 3.0 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described previously (31Neumann M. Schulte M. Jünemann N. Stöcklein W. Leimkühler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The autosampler racks containing the sample vials were cooled to 4 °C. Immobilization of proteins yielded about 700–3,300 resonance units (RU) per flow cell (BSA: 1,530 RU; Isd11: 700 RU; MOCS3-RLD: 3,360 RU; Uba4: 1,870 RU).As running buffer, 20 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4 was used. Nfs1Δ1–55 and Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 with concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 μm were injected for 4.5 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min followed by 15 min of dissociation using the kinject command and regeneration of the sensor surface with 50 mm HCl for 1 min. Binding curves were corrected by subtraction of buffer injection curves for all four flow cells and curves of Nfs1Δ1–55 and Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 for the control flow cell.Detection of Sulfur Transfer from Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 to MOCS3-RLD—For sulfur transfer from Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 to MOCS3-RLD, the proteins were incubated in a 1:1 ratio at a concentration of 2 μm in the presence of 10 mm l-cysteine and 30 mm KCN in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0 over a period of 12 h. Produced thiocyanate was determined using the assay described by Sörbo (32Sörbo B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 23: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For comparison, MOCS3-RLD was also incubated with 10 mm sodium thiosulfate. To ensure that MOCS3-RLD was added in a sulfur-free form to the assay, the protein was incubated with 5 mm KCN for 10 min at 4 °C prior to addition to the incubation mixtures, and produced thiocyanate was removed by gel filtration on a Nick column (GE Healthcare).Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)—For the ESI-MS measurements, MOCS3-RLD was prepared in its persulfide-free form as described above. The persulfide-containing form of MOCS3-RLD was obtained after incubation of 50 μm MOCS3-RLD with 50 mm thiosulfate for 30 min. Persulfide-free MOCS3-RLD (50 μm) was additionally incubated with 5 mm l-cysteine for 1 h at 4 °C, and l-cysteine was subsequently removed by gel filtration.For sulfur transfer of Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11-bound persulfide to MOCS3-RLD, 20 μm Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 was mixed with 50 μm persulfide-free MOCS3-RLD and 2 mm l-cysteine in 50 mm Hepes and 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. After incubation for 12 h at 4 °C, l-cysteine was removed by gel filtration. In addition, the MOCS3-RLD-C412A variant was used as a control, to verify the persulfide formation on Cys412 of MOCS3-RLD, which was not detected in this mutant (13Matthies A. Nimtz M. Leimkühler S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7912-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).For ESI-MS measurements, the buffer of all proteins was changed to 3 mm NH4OAc by gel filtration, pH 8.0. 1–3 μl of the intact proteins, were diluted 1:1 with methanol followed by addition of 10% formic acid (final concentration 1–10 pmol/μl) and filled into a nanospray gold-coated glass capillary, placed orthogonally in front of the entrance hole of a QTOF-II instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Approximately 1000 V was applied to the capillary, and ions were separated by the time-of-flight analyzer. Protein spectra were deconvoluted using the MaxEnt1 software package.RESULTSPurification of Nfs1Δ1–55, Isd11, and Copurification of the Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 Complex—For purification of Nfs1, the Nfs1 gene coding for amino acids 56–458 was cloned into the E. coli pET15b expression vector, resulting in a N-terminal His6-tagged recombinant protein. To increase protein stability, E. coli groEL genes were coexpressed with Nfs1Δ1–55. The soluble fraction of Nfs1Δ1–55 was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography and size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column, and after elution one major band was visible on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a size, corresponding closely to the calculated molecular mass of 47.3 kDa for His6-tagged Nfs1Δ1–55 (Fig. 1A). Densitometric analyses showed that the protein was 65% pure. The additional band visible on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel was determined by MALDI-peptide mapping and confirmed by MS/MS analyses to be the E. coli SlyD protein, a histidine-rich FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cistrans isomerase, a protein that is often copurified with recombinant proteins by Ni-NTA chromatography. The purified Nfs1Δ1–55 protein was stable for about 2 days at 4 °C. In contrast, the full-length Nfs1 protein could not be purified because the majority of the protein was unstable or existed in inclusion bodies after expression in E. coli. Coexpression of GroEL resulted in a higher yield of soluble Nfs1Δ1–55, likely by preventing the formation of inclusion bodies during expression. In contrast, the stability of the purified protein was not influenced by the presence of GroEL during expression, as shown by thermal denaturation studies using circular dichroism spectroscopy (see supplemental Fig. S1, which is published as supplemental data on the JBC web site).For purification of Isd11, the Isd11 gene was cloned into the E. coli pET15b expression vector, resulting in the N-terminal His6-tagged recombinant protein. Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column was carried out to obtain a purified Isd11 in a soluble form. The purified Isd11 displayed a single band on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a monomeric mass corresponding to the calculated mass of the His6-tagged Isd11 of 13.4 kDa (Fig. 1C).To increase the stability of Nfs1Δ1–55, the Isd11 gene was cloned into a vector containing the P15A origin and coexpressed with Nfs1Δ1–55 in E. coli cells. The Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 complex was purified by Ni-NTA and size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column, and displayed two bands on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1B), corresponding to Nfs1Δ1–55 and Isd11, respectively. The presence of Isd11 increased the stability of Nfs1 significantly, the protein was stable for several days at 4 °C and did not lose activity after storage at –20 °C. As shown by thermal denaturation studies by circular dichroism spectroscopy, the protein also displayed a better stability at higher temperatures in comparison to Nfs1Δ1–55 expressed in the absence of Isd11 (see supplemental Fig. S1, which is published as supplemental data on the JBC web site).To identify the oligomerization state of Nfs1Δ1–55 and the Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 complex, the purified proteins were subjected to size exclusion chromatography. The observed elution position of Nfs1Δ1–55 from a Superdex 200 column corresponded to a mass of 90 kDa (Fig. 2A), showing that the protein existed as a dimer in solution. In comparison to proteins with a similar size, the observed elution position of the Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 complex revealed a mass of ∼250 kDa on the analytical size exclusion column (Fig. 2B), at least corresponding to a (Nfs1Δ1–552/Isd112)2 octamer.FIGURE 2Size exclusion chromatography of Nfs1Δ1–55 and Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11. A, 27 μm of Nfs1Δ1–55; B,3 μm of Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 were analyzed by analytical size exclusion chromatography in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, using a Superdex 200 column.

Thus, we analyzed whether Nfs1 was able to functionally complement the E. coli CL100(iscS–) strain (33Lauhon C.T. Kambampati R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The E. coli CL100(iscS–) strain was either transformed with the plasmid containing Nfs1Δ1–55 or cotransformed with the Nfs1Δ1–55- and Isd11-containing plasmids, and cells were grown at 30 °C in the presence of IPTG over a period of 8 h. The corresponding growth curves showed that Nfs1Δ1–55 was able to complement the role of IscS in the E. coli CL100(iscS–) strain both in the presence or absence of Isd11, showing that the Nfs1Δ1–55 was expressed in a functional form (data not shown).The purified Nfs1Δ1–55 protein exhibited the characteristic yellow color observed for other l-cysteine desulfurases containing PLP as prosthetic group. UV-VIS absorption spectra of the purified Nfs1Δ1–55 and the Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 complex were similar and exhibited the absorption maximum at 420 nm (Fig. 3, A and B), characteristic for l-cysteine desulfurases (17Zheng L.

The addition of 20 mm l-cysteine resulted in a decrease of absorbance at 420 nm and an increase of absorbance at 320 nm of both purified Nfs1Δ1–55 and Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 (Fig. 3), showing that both proteins were reduced by l-cysteine. However, Nfs1Δ1–55 was only able to perform one turnover and precipitated rapidly after reduction (Fig. 3A, data not shown).FIGURE 3Characterization of Nfs1Δ1–55 and Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 by UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy.

The pH optimum of Nfs1-Δ1–55/Isd11 was determined to be at 8.0 and the temperature optimum was at 46 °C (data not shown). Enzyme assays were performed at 37 °C by varying the concentrations of l-cysteine and enzyme activity was determined using the methylene blue method, detecting the release of H2S in the assay (28Fogo J.K. Popowsky M. Anal Chem. 1949; 21: 732-734Crossref Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was only detectable for the Nfs1Δ1–55/Isd11 complex. For Nfs1Δ1–55, no enzyme activity could be detected even at lower temperatures (data not shown). This is consistent with the observation, that Nfs1Δ1–55 is rather unstable after reduction and precipitated under the assay conditions. Thus, the apparent kinetic con"
https://openalex.org/W2074215706,"Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli attaches to the intestine through actin pedestals that are formed when the bacterium injects its protein EspFU (also known as TccP) into host cells1. EspFU potently activates the host WASP (Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein) family of actin-nucleating factors, which are normally activated by the GTPase CDC42, among other signalling molecules. Apart from its amino-terminal type III secretion signal, EspFU consists of five-and-a-half 47-amino-acid repeats. Here we show that a 17-residue motif within this EspFU repeat is sufficient for interaction with N-WASP (also known as WASL). Unlike most pathogen proteins that interface with the cytoskeletal machinery, this motif does not mimic natural upstream activators: instead of mimicking an activated state of CDC42, EspFU mimics an autoinhibitory element found within N-WASP. Thus, EspFU activates N-WASP by competitively disrupting the autoinhibited state. By mimicking an internal regulatory element and not the natural activator, EspFU selectively activates only a precise subset of CDC42-activated processes. Although one repeat is able to stimulate actin polymerization, we show that multiple-repeat fragments have notably increased potency. The activities of these EspFU fragments correlate with their ability to coordinate activation of at least two N-WASP proteins. Thus, this pathogen has used a simple autoinhibitory fragment as a component to build a highly effective actin polymerization machine."

We present the solution NMR structure of RyRP12 bound to Ca2+-S100A1, which has several striking similarities to that observed previously for the RyR1 (residues 3614-3643 in human)-CaM complex (17Maximciuc A.A.

Furthermore, competition binding experiments show that Ca2+-S100A1 competes directly with an RyR antagonist, Ca2+-CaM, for the same binding site on RyR1 and could explain how S100A1 promotes Ca2+ release in skeletal and heart muscle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFluo-4 AM Fluorescent Recordings—FDB fibers were isolated from transgenic S100A1 KO mice and their wild type age-matched, sex-matched littermates (described in Ref. 6Prosser B.L.

Following enzymatic dissociation and ∼24 h in culture, FDB skeletal fiber cultures were loaded with 2 μm Fluo-4 AM in 0.1% DMSO for 30 min, rinsed with Ringer's solution three times, and equilibrated for 30 min before recording. The culture chamber was then mounted on an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope using a 60×/1.20 NA water immersion objective coupled to a cell map laser scanning confocal system (Bio-Rad). The system was operated in line scan x-t mode at a scanning speed of 2 ms/line for 512 ms. Line scan images were processed, and fluorescent recordings were converted to ΔF/F0 values. Statistical analysis was performed using OriginPro 7.5. All significance tests were done using Student's t test, and significance was set at p < 0.05.Western Blots—Recombinant S100A1 was attached to CH-Sepharose beads (Sigma) using standard methods. Intact RyR in SR vesicles were prepared as described previously and bound to S100A1 beads in the presence of calcium (100 nm to 1.0 mm) prior to competition experiments with variable concentrations of calmodulin (6Prosser B.L. Wright N.T. Hernandez-Ochoa E. Varney K.M. Liu Y. Olojo R.O. Zimmer D.B. Weber D.J. Schneider M.F. J. Biol.

After incubation, 8-μl aliquots of the S100A1-linked beads were washed, boiled, and loaded into an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. An anti-RyR antibody (C34) (Sigma) was used to detect RyR, and ImageJ software, available on the National Institutes of Health website, was used to quantify the intensity of each band from the Western blot.Sample Preparations—A synthetic peptide derived from the S100A1/calmodulin binding domain of human RyR1 (residues 3616-3627) was chemically synthesized and prepared for NMR as described previously (6Prosser B.L.

Recombinant 15N- and 13C,15N-labeled S100A1 human S100A1 protein was purified after overexpression in Escherichia coli (HMS174(DE3)) as described (12Wright N.T. Varney K.M. Ellis K.C. Markowitz J.

NMR samples contained 15 mm d11-Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 15 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.34 mm NaN3, 20 mm NaCl, 10% 2H2O, RyRP12 peptide (2-6 mm), and S100A1 (1-3 mm; subunit concentration). Acrylamide solutions used for dipolar coupling experiments were prepared as described previously (12Wright N.T. Varney K.M. Ellis K.C. Markowitz J. Gitti R.K. Zimmer D.B. Weber D.J. J. Mol.

Sequential backbone and side chain assignments of S100A1 in the RyRP12 peptide complex were obtained using standard NMR spectroscopy methods as described (6Prosser B.L. Wright N.T. Hernandez-Ochoa E.

The sequential assignments for the unlabeled RyRP12 peptide bound to 13C,15N-labeled Ca2+-S100A1 were based on correlations recorded in 15N- and 13C-filtered TOCSY and 15N- and 13C-filtered NOESY experiments (31Bax A.

The backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift assignments are complete. Chemical shifts assignments for S100A1 and the RyRP12 peptide in the RyRP12-Ca2+-S100A1 complex have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession numbers 15296 and 15704).Structure Calculations—Interproton distance constraints were derived from two-, three-, and four-dimensional NOESY experiments (two-dimensional NOESY, 12C-filtered two-dimensional NOESY, 15N-edited three-dimensional NOESY, 12C-filtered and 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY, 15N- and 13C-edited four-dimensional NOESY, and 13C and 13C-edited four-dimensional NOESY) as described previously (6Prosser B.L.

Dihedral constraints φ ± 20 and ψ ± 15° for α-helix and φ ± 40 and ψ ± 40° for β-sheet were included based on 3JNH-Hα coupling constants, hydrogen exchange rates, and the chemical shift index (35Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar) of 1Hα and 13Cα atoms. Distance constraints of 2.0-2.8 Å between Ca2+ and protein ligands were included based on the EF-hand model for a typical and S100-type calcium binding domain, respectively (33Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The inclusion of such restraints had no effect on the overall structure of the complex. Hydrogen bond constraints of rHN-O = 1.5-2.8 Å and rN-O = 2.4-2.5 Å were included in the final stage of structure calculations. Pseudopotentials for secondary 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts and a conformational data base potential were included in the final simulated annealing refinements using the computer program XPLOR (36Brünger A.T.

The internuclear dipolar couplings (in Hz) were determined from the difference in J splitting between isotropic and axially compressed polyacrylamide-aligned phases, using both a two-dimensional IPAP 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence to record N-HN splittings and a three-dimensional CT-(H)CA(CO)NH experiment without Hα decoupling during Cα acquisition in t2 to record Cα-Hα splittings, as described previously (12Wright N.T.

To address this issue directly, SR vesicles containing intact RyR1 were incubated with Sepharose-linked S100A1 beads at high [Ca2+] in the presence of increasing amounts of CaM. As observed in Fig. 1B, CaM fully displaced RyR1 from the S100A1 beads in a concentration-dependent manner indicating that S100A1 binds to the same region as CaM in the intact RyR. Because residues 3416-3427 of the CaMBD very closely resemble the canonical S100-binding sequence (RyRP12: Lys-Lys-Ala-Val-Trp-His-Lys-Leu-Leu-Ser-Lys-Gln; underlined residues are the S100 consensus binding sequence), we next tested whether RyRP12 could compete with full-length RyR1 binding to Sepharose-S100A1 beads in the presence of micromolar [Ca2+]. Fig. 1C shows that RyRP12 was sufficient to elute intact full-length RyR1 from Sepharose-S100A1 beads, providing evidence that this peptide includes a major portion of the S100A1-binding site on RyR1.Taken together, these results show that S100A1 competes with CaM for the same binding site of RyR1 and that the RyRP12 peptide can disrupt a complex involving S100A1 and full-length RyR1. Furthermore, genetic deletion of S100A1 significantly decreased calcium release from the SR of skeletal muscle. Given that the RyRP12-S100A1 complex is both structurally and functionally relevant in modulating SR calcium release in skeletal muscle, we solved the solution structure of RyRP12 bound to Ca2+-S100A1.Solution NMR Structure of Ca2+-S100A1 Bound to RyRP12—The size of the RyRP12-S100A1 complex (24 kDa) necessitated the collection of a series of heteronuclear multidimensional NMR experiments to determine its structure in solution. The 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift assignments for the backbone and side chain resonances of Ca2+-S100A1 bound to RyRP12 were conducted using standard NMR through-bond experiments and are described in Prosser et al.

Unambiguous resonance and NOE assignments for the unlabeled RyRP12 peptide bound to 13C-, 15N-labeled S100A1 were made using two-dimensional 12C-filtered spectra (NOESY, TOCSY in H2O and D2O), which removed all resonances arising from the labeled S100A1 (Fig. 2A). With the same sample in H2O, a three-dimensional 13C-edited, 12C-filtered NOESY experiment was then collected to assign intermolecular NOE correlations between 13C, 15N-labeled S100A1 and unlabeled RyRP12 peptide (Fig. 2B). This NMR experiment detects only NOE correlations between protons attached to 13C and protons attached to 12C; therefore, only those NOE correlations at the peptide (12C)-protein (13C) interface are detected. Unambiguous assignment of intramolecular NOE correlations for Ca2+-S100A1 in the protein-peptide complex was achieved via three-dimensional 15N-edite"
https://openalex.org/W1969898475,"Maturation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) involves furin-dependent cleavage at two extracellular sites within the alpha subunit and at a single extracellular site within the gamma subunit. Channels lacking furin processing of the alpha subunit have very low activity. We recently identified a prostasin-dependent cleavage site (RKRK(186)) in the gamma subunit. We also demonstrated that the tract alpha D206-R231, between the two furin cleavage sites in the alpha subunit, as well as the tract gamma E144-K186, between the furin and prostasin cleavage sites in the gamma subunit, are inhibitory domains. ENaC cleavage by furin, and subsequently by prostasin, leads to a stepwise increase in the open probability of the channel as a result of release of the alpha and gamma subunit inhibitory tracts, respectively. We examined whether release of either the alpha or gamma inhibitory tract has a dominant role in activating the channel. Co-expression of prostasin and either wild type channels or mutant channels lacking furin cleavage of the alpha subunit (alphaR205A,R208A,R231Abetagamma) in Xenopus laevis oocytes led to increases in whole cell currents to similar levels. In an analogous manner and independent of the proteolytic processing of the alpha subunit, amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes expressing channels carrying gamma subunits with both a mutation in the furin cleavage site and a deletion of the inhibitory tract (alphabetagammaR143A,DeltaE144-K186 and alphaR205A,R208A,R231AbetagammaR143A, DeltaE144-K186) were significantly higher than those from oocytes expressing wild type ENaC. When channels lacked the alpha and gamma subunit inhibitory tracts, alpha subunit cleavage was required for channels to be fully active. Channels lacking both furin cleavage and the inhibitory tract in the gamma subunit (alphabetagammaR143A,DeltaE144-K186) showed a significant reduction in the efficacy of block by the synthetic alpha-26 inhibitory peptide representing the tract alphaD206-R231. Our data indicate that removal of the inhibitory tract from the gamma subunit, in the absence of alpha subunit cleavage, results in nearly full activation of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1973247376,"During infection, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) takes over the actin cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells by injecting the EspF(U) protein into the host cytoplasm. EspF(U) controls actin by activating members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family. Here we show that EspF(U) binds to the autoinhibitory GTPase binding domain (GBD) in WASP proteins and displaces it from the activity-bearing VCA domain (for verprolin homology, central hydrophobic and acidic regions). This interaction potently activates WASP and neural (N)-WASP in vitro and induces localized actin assembly in cells. In the solution structure of the GBD-EspF(U) complex, EspF(U) forms an amphipathic helix that binds the GBD, mimicking interactions of the VCA domain in autoinhibited WASP. Thus, EspF(U) activates WASP by competing directly for the VCA binding site on the GBD. This mechanism is distinct from that used by the eukaryotic activators Cdc42 and SH2 domains, which globally destabilize the GBD fold to release the VCA. Such diversity of mechanism in WASP proteins is distinct from other multimodular systems, and may result from the intrinsically unstructured nature of the isolated GBD and VCA elements. The structural incompatibility of the GBD complexes with EspF(U) and Cdc42/SH2, plus high-affinity EspF(U) binding, enable EHEC to hijack the eukaryotic cytoskeletal machinery effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2020275133,"Although many stimuli activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), the kinetics and compartmentalization of ERK1/2 signals are stimulus-dependent and dictate physiological consequences. ERKs can be inactivated by dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), notably the MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) and atypical DUSPs, that can both dephosphorylate and scaffold ERK1/2. Using a cell imaging model (based on knockdown of endogenous ERKs and add-back of wild-type or mutated ERK2-GFP reporters), we explored possible effects of DUSPs on responses to transient or sustained ERK2 activators (epidermal growth factor and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, respectively). For both stimuli, a D319N mutation (which impairs DUSP binding) increased ERK2 activity and reduced nuclear accumulation. These stimuli also increased mRNA levels for eight DUSPs. In a short inhibitory RNA screen, 12 of 16 DUSPs influenced ERK2 responses. These effects were evident among nuclear inducible MKP, cytoplasmic ERK MKP, JNK/p38 MKP, and atypical DUSP subtypes and, with the exception of the nuclear inducible MKPs, were paralleled by corresponding changes in Egr-1 luciferase activation. Simultaneous removal of all JNK/p38 MKPs or nuclear inducible MKPs revealed them as positive and negative regulators of ERK2 signaling, respectively. The effects of JNK/p38 MKP short inhibitory RNAs were not dependent on protein neosynthesis but were reversed in the presence of JNK and p38 kinase inhibitors, indicating DUSP-mediated cross-talk between MAPK pathways. Overall, our data reveal that a large number of DUSPs influence ERK2 signaling. Together with the known tissue-specific expression of DUSPs and the importance of ERK1/2 in cell regulation, our data support the potential value of DUSPs as targets for drug therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2061324513,"Currently inherited or acquired skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, resulting in increased levels of intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs) and lipid intermediates, inducing insulin resistance. The present study aimed to clarify the order of changes in IMCL levels and skeletal muscle mitochondrial function during the development of type 2 diabetes in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. IMCL levels and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity were determined in vivo, using localized (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and dynamic (31)P MRS, respectively. In parallel, in vitro activities were measured from enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Fa/fa ZDF rats were studied at 3 different ages corresponding to different stages of type 2 diabetes, whereas fa/+ rats served as controls. Fa/fa ZDF rats had higher IMCL contents than controls throughout the duration of the study. In vivo muscle oxidative capacity was not different in fa/fa animals compared to controls, and in vitro enzyme activity data suggested improved functionality of enzymes involved in fat oxidation in type 2 diabetic animals. Accordingly, we can conclude that in the ZDF rat model, type 2 diabetes develops in the absence of skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction."

Semi-synthetic paclitaxel (<0.5% PTX degradation products) was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in 1% DMSO and pyrogen-free water.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human MD-2 from P. pastorisMD-2 cDNA was amplified by PCR from pEFBOS (37Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar) MD-2, and the correct nucleotide sequence PCR product was confirmed by DNA sequencing and inserted into the pPICZB expression vector. The cloned product (pPICZB-MD-2) in the expression vector flanked by the yeast AOXI gene and a His6 selection marker was confirmed by sequencing using the AOXI forward and reverse primers (Invitrogen). As previously described (34Zimmer S. Zughaier S. Tzeng Y.-L. Stephens D. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), cell pellets were washed with breaking buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture with broad specificity for the inhibition of serine, cysteine, aspartic, and aminopeptidases and thermolysin-like activities (Sigma). P. pastoris were vortexed with one-fifth volume 0.5-mm glass beads seven times and incubated on ice. Lysed cells were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was harvested for purification. Five ml of cleared supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Qiagen) and gently shaken at 200 rpm on a rotary shaker at 4 °C for 2 h. Washing and elution of rhMD-2 was done following the manufacturer's instructions.SDS-PAGE and Western BlottingThe eluted MD-2 proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, according to the method of Laemmli (38Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Coomassie Blue staining, and protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford assay (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) comparing elutions of rhMD-2 with known concentrations of BSA. For Western blotting, resolved proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry electroblot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and recognized by mouse anti-hMD-2 antibody or anti-His6 antibody diluted at 1:1000. The identity of rhMD-2 was confirmed by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (Emory University microchemical facility). The samples were digested in-gel overnight with trypsin at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on the quadruple time offlight (QTOF) mass spectrometer instrument. The data from peptide sequences were used to search the Sprot data base (human taxa).Cell CulturesTHP-1 human macrophage-like cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamate supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% nonessential amino acids. Murine macrophages (RAW264.7) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as noted above. Culture flasks were incubated at 37 °C with humidity under 5% CO2.Cytokine InductionTHP-1 human monocytes were differentiated into macrophage-like cells using phorbol myristate acetate at a final concentration of 10 ng/106 cells and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Differentiated macrophages were washed with PBS, counted, adjusted to 106 cells/ml, and transferred into a 24-well tissue culture plate (1 ml/well). The cells were stimulated with 0.56 pmol of LOS or PTX in the indicated concentrations (0.125-100 μm) overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell culture supernatants were harvested and saved at -20 °C. RAW 246.7 macrophages adherent to the flask were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Harvested cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's complete medium. Macrophages (106 cells/ml) were transferred to 24-well tissue culture plates and stimulated with serial dilutions of PTX (0.19-100 μm). Induced RAW 246.7 macrophages were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell culture supernatants were harvested and saved at -20 °C.HEK293 Transfection with TLR4 and MD-2HEK293 cells seeded in 12-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg/well of the pEFBOS-human TLR4, the pEFBOS-human MD-2, pUNO-mouse MD-2, pUNO-mouse TLR4, or a combination of two plasmids together and SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) for 3 h. An empty vector was used as a control. Fresh medium was applied, and the cells were allowed to recover for 12-18 h before stimulation with NMB (0.56 pmol/ml) or PTX (10 μm) overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell culture supernatants were harvested and saved at -20 °C.Cytokine and Chemokine Quantification by ELISAHuman or murine TNF-α (THP-1 or RAW 246.7 supernatants, respectively) and human interleukin-8 (HEK293 supernatants) Duoset kits (R&D Systems) were used for cytokine quantification according to the manufacturer's instructions. Maxisorp ELISA plates were obtained from Nalge Nunc International (Rochester, NY).PTX Binding to Immobilized rhMD-2 (See Fig. 5a)96-well Maxisorp microtiter plates were coated overnight with 100 μl of increasing concentrations of MD-2 (0-100 μg/ml) or BSA (10 mg/ml) in 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Plates were then washed three times with washing buffer (1 mg/ml BSA, 50 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and blocked for 1 h at 37°C with blocking buffer (10 mg/ml BSA, 50 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4). Plates were washed three times in wash buffer and then incubated with 100 μl of NMB (0.3 μg/well) or PTX (1 μm or 10 μm) for 3 h at 37 °C. Plates were again washed three times and incubated with 100 μl of anti-His6 antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:500 in wash buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After three washings, 100 μl of a secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 in wash buffer) was added for 1 h at room temperature. The ELISA was developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.5 m diethanolamine buffer containing 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5, and was read at A405 nm.Human rMD-2 Binding to PTX and NMB (See Fig. 5b)Maxisorp microtiter plates were coated for 3 h with PTX (10 μm), NMB (0.3 μg/ml), or BSA (10 mg/ml) in 0.1 m Na2CO3, 20 mm EDTA, pH 9.6, at 37 °C. Plates were washed with water, allowed to air-dry, and then blocked for 3 h with blocking buffer. Plates were then washed three times with washing buffer and incubated for 3 h at 37°C with 100 μl/well rhMD-2 (10 μg/ml). rhMD-2 was preincubated on ice without or with increasing concentrations of anti-human MD-2 antibody or an isotype control antibody (0-2 μg/well). Plates were then washed three times with wash buffer, incubated with biotinylated anti-His6 antibody (Sigma) (1:200) for 2 h at room temperature, again washed three times with wash buffer, and incubated with 100 μl/well 1:200 streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (R&D Systems) for 30 min at room temperature. The ELISA was developed with substrate solution (R&D Systems), stopped with 50 μl/well of 2 n H2SO4, and read at A450 nm.Dose-dependent rhMD-2 Binding to PTXMaxisorp microtiter plates were coated for 3 h with increasing concentrations of PTX (1, 10, and 100 μm) or BSA (10 mg/ml) in 0.1 m Na2CO3, 20 mm EDTA, pH 9.6, at 37 °C. Plates were washed with water, allowed to air-dry, and then blocked for 3 h with blocking buffer. Plates were then washed three times with washing buffer and incubated for 3 h at 37°C with 100 μl/well of rhMD-2 ranging from 0 to 100 μg/ml. Plates were then washed three times with wash buffer, incubated with biotinylated anti-His6 antibody (Sigma) (1:200) for 2 h at room temperature, again washed three times with wash buffer, and incubated with 100 μl/well 1:200 streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (R&D Systems) for 30 min at room temperature. The ELISA was developed with substrate solution (R&D Systems), stopped with 50 μl/well of 2 n H2SO4, and read at OD 450 nm.Homology ModelingA homology model of mouse MD-2 was constructed by application of Prime version 1.6 with the Maestro interface (Schrödinger, LLC) and by using the crystal structure of hMD-2 complexed with lipid IVa (PDB code 2E59; 79% sequence similarity) (29Ohto U. Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) as a template. The resulting homology model was refined by backbone and side chain energy optimizations using the OPLS force field within Prime. A WHATIF (40Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar) analysis demonstrated very similar Z-scores between the mMD-2 homology model and the hMD-2 crystal structure in terms of first and second generation packing quality, χ-1/χ-2 rotamer normality, and backbone conformation.Computational Ligand-Protein DockingGlide Docking—Previously established NAMFIS (NMR analysis of molecular flexibility in solution) conformations of PTX (41Snyder J.P. Nevins N. Cicero D.O. Jansen J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 724-725Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were docked separately into the cavity regions of the human MD-2 crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 2E59) (29Ohto U. Fukase K. Miyake K. Satow Y. Science. 2007; 316: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) devoid of lipid IVa and the mMD-2 homology model described above using Glide with SP precision (Schrödinger, LLC). This methodology regards the structure of the protein as a rigid body but treats the ligand as a conformationally flexible molecule. The same PTX conformers were similarly docked into the ligand-free MD-2 x-ray structures derived from the hybrid TLR4·hMD-2·eritoran complex (Protein Data Bank code 2Z65) and the mTLR4·mMD-2 complex (Protein Data Bank code 2Z64) (30Kim H.M. Park B.S. Kim J.I. Kim S.E. Lee J. Oh S.C. Enkhbayar P. Matsushima N. Lee H. Yoo O.J. Lee J.O. Cell. 2007; 130: 906-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Neither MD-2 docking exercise led to NAMFIS conformations as the favored binding pose. Glide was also used to examine the relative energies of PTX docked to the external surfaces of the MD-2 proteins.Induced Fit Docking—To improve the fit between protein interior and PTX and to achieve deeper residence of the ligand within the cavity, induced fit docking with Prime version 1.6 (Schrödinger) was performed. This approach allows both protein side chain movement and ligand flexibility. Duplicate poses were removed with MacroModel (Schrödinger), and the resulting MD-2·PTX complexes were sorted energetically with the MMGBSA scoring algorithm (42Jayaram B. Sprous D. Beveridge D.L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 9571-9576Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar).Molecular VolumesThe ligand volumes were calculated by extracting the structures from their respective protein x-ray or electron crystallo-graphic (e.g. PTX T-Taxol conformation) complexes as Protein Data Bank files, followed by importing into the Spartan software (Wavefunction, Inc., Irvine, CA). A single point energy calculation provides the volume of the corresponding CPK model. The volumes of the MD-2 cavities were obtained by the World Wide Web-based CASTp package. (44Dundas J. Ouyang Z.

https://openalex.org/W2051871263,"Anoikis, apoptotic cell death due to loss of cell adhesion, is critical for regulation of tissue homeostasis in tissue remodeling. Fibrogenesis is associated with reduced fibroblast apoptosis. The matricellular protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) regulates cell adhesion and motility during tissue remodeling and in fibrogenesis. The N-terminal domain of TSP1 binds to the calreticulin-LRP1 receptor co-complex to signal down-regulation of cell adhesion and increased cell motility through focal adhesion disassembly. TSP1 signaling through calreticulin-LRP1 activates cell survival signals such as PI3-kinase. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that TSP1 supports cell survival under adhesion-independent conditions to facilitate tissue remodeling. Here, we show that platelet TSP1, its N-terminal domain (NoC1) as a recombinant protein, or a peptide comprising the calreticulin-LRP1 binding site [amino acids 17-35 (hep I)] in the N-terminal domain promotes fibroblast survival under anchorage-independent conditions. TSP1 activates Akt and decreases apoptotic signaling through caspase 3 and PARP1 in suspended fibroblasts. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt activity blocks TSP1-mediated anchorage-independent survival. Fibroblasts lacking LRP1 or expressing calreticulin lacking the TSP1 binding site do not respond to TSP1 with anchorage-independent survival. These data define a novel role for TSP1 signaling through the calreticulin/LRP1 co-complex in tissue remodeling and fibrotic responses through stimulation of anoikis resistance.-Pallero, M.

https://openalex.org/W2101664777,"This study identifies a novel mechanism by which thiazolidinediones mediate cyclin D1 repression in prostate cancer cells. Based on the finding that the thiazolidinedione family of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists mediated PPARγ-independent cyclin D1 degradation, we developed a novel PPARγ-inactive troglitazone derivative, STG28, with high potency in cyclin D1 ablation. STG28-mediated cyclin D1 degradation was preceded by Thr-286 phosphorylation and nuclear export, which however, were independent of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. Mutational analysis further confirmed the pivotal role of Thr-286 phosphorylation in STG28-induced nuclear export and proteolysis. Of several kinases examined, inhibition of IκB kinase α blocked STG28-mediated cytoplasmic sequestration and degradation of cyclin D1. Pulldown of ectopically expressed Cul1, the scaffold protein of the Skp-Cullin-F-box E3 ligase, in STG28-treated cells revealed an increased association of cyclin D1 with β-TrCP, whereas no specific binding was noted with other F-box proteins examined, including Skp2, Fbw7, Fbx4, and Fbxw8. This finding represents the first evidence that cyclin D1 is targeted by β-TrCP. Moreover, β-TrCP expression was up-regulated in response to STG28, and ectopic expression and small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of β-TrCP enhanced and protected against STG28-facilitated cyclin D1 degradation, respectively. Because cyclin D1 lacks the DSG destruction motif, mutational and modeling analyses indicate that cyclin D1 was targeted by β-TrCP through an unconventional recognition site, 279EEVDLACpT286, reminiscent to that of Wee1. Moreover, we obtained evidence that this β-TrCP-dependent degradation takes part in controlling cyclin D1 turnover when cancer cells undergo glucose starvation, which endows physiological relevance to this novel mechanism.

Substantial evidence indicates that overexpression of the cell cycle control gene CCND1 represents a key mechanism underlying tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis in a variety of human cancers (1Diehl J.A.

Res. 2004; 119: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 serves as the regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 and exhibits the ability to bind and sequester the CDK inhibitor p27 (5Fu M. Wang C. Li Z. Sakamaki T. Pestell R.G. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5439-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 6Wang C. Li Z. Fu M. Bouras T. Pestell R.G. Cancer Treat.

Together, these functions facilitate cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylating inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), resulting in G1/S progression. Moreover, cyclin D1 may regulate gene transcription through physical associations with a plethora of transcriptional factors, coactivators, and corepressors that govern histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling proteins (5Fu M. Wang C. Li Z. Sakamaki T. Pestell R.G. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5439-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The concerted action of these cyclin-dependent kinase-dependent and -independent functions underscores the oncogenic potential of cyclin D1 in many forms of cancer (7Ewen M.E. Lamb J. Trends Mol.

Cancer. 2007; 6: 24-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Consequently, the mechanism that regulates cyclin D1 stability has been the focus of many recent investigations.

Moreover, we obtained evidence that troglitazone mediated cyclin D1 proteolysis independently of PPARγ activation (32Huang J.W. Shiau C.W. Yang Y.T. Kulp S.K. Chen K.F. Brueggemeier R.W. Shapiro C.L.

Albeit devoid of PPARγ activity, STG28 retains the ability of troglitazone to repress cyclin D1 and a series of cell cycle regulatory proteins, including β-catenin (34Wei S. Lin L.F. Yang C.C.

In light of the therapeutic potential of STG28 in cancer therapy, we embarked on investigating the mechanism underlying the effect of STG28 on facilitating the proteasomal degradation of target proteins. In this study we report a new pathway that involves SCFβ-TrCP in STG28-facilitated cyclin D1 ablation. It is noteworthy that cyclin D1 lacks the DSG destruction motif commonly found in other β-TrCP target proteins. Mutational and molecular modeling analyses indicate that the β-TrCP recognition of cyclin D1 was achieved through an unconventional motif, 279EEVDLACT286. Cell Culture—LNCaP prostate cancer cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in T-75 flasks with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Reagents—MG132, leptomycin B, PD98059, Bay11-7082, lithium chloride, and SB216763 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. SB203580 was obtained from Calbiochem. Glucose-deprived RPMI 1640 medium was purchased from Invitrogen. The PPARγ-inactive thiazolidinedione derivative STG28 was synthesized according to a published procedure (33Huang J.W. Shiau C.W.

Plasmid Constructions, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Semi-quantitative PCR Analysis—The cDNA encoding full-length human cyclin D1 was PCR-amplified from a human testicular cDNA library with primers 5′-GCAGATCTATGGAACACCAGCTCCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGATGTCCACGTCCCG-3′ (reverse) that were flanked by BglII and EcoRI restriction sites. The resulting fragments were subcloned into a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven GFP vector, pEGFP-C1 (Invitrogen), with a GFP protein fusion at its N terminus. This full-length cyclin D1 plasmid was named as pWT-cyclin D1-GFP and used as template to create a series of truncated or mutated cyclin D1 constructs. The pN-terminal (NT)-, pC-terminal (CT)-, pΔPEST-cyclin D1-GFP plasmids were constructed by using a PCR approach and subsequently cloned into pEGFP-C1 (see Fig. 2A, lower panel). Plasmids encoding various cyclin D1 mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis from pWT cyclin D1-GFP by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). The pMyc4-hSkp2-CMV14 plasmid encoding Myc-tagged full-length Skp2 (37Yang C.S. Yu C. Chuang H.C. Chang C.W. Chang G.D. Yao T.P. Chen H. J. Biol.

All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Semiquantitative PCR analysis was performed by extracting total mRNA from STG28-treated cells followed by reverse transcriptase PCR according to a previously described procedure (32Huang J.W. Shiau C.W. Yang Y.T. Kulp S.K. Chen K.F. Brueggemeier R.W. Shapiro C.L. Chen C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis—LNCaP cells were exposed to 10 μm STG28 in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium for various time intervals, collected by trypsinization, and fixed in icecold 80% ethanol, PBS at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g at room temperature, and after decanting the ethanol without disturbing the pellet, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) and RNase A (50 units/ml) in PBS. Cell cycle phase distributions were determined on a FACScort flow cytometer and analyzed by the Mod-FitLT V3.0 program. Immunocytochemical Analysis—LNCaP cells growing on slides in 6-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well) in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium were exposed to 10 μm STG28 for different intervals. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, washed with PBS twice, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and blocked for 30 min in medium containing serum. After another wash, immunostaining was performed by incubating cells with mouse anti-cyclin D1 (1:100 dilution) or rabbit anti-β-TrCP (Santa Cruz; 1:100) primary antibody at room temperature for 12 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After washing with PBS, the bounded primary antibodies were detected using AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse or AlexaFluor 555 goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes; 1:100) at room temperature for 2 h. The nuclear counterstaining was performed using a 4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-containing mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) before examination. Images of immunocytochemically labeled samples were observed using a Nikon microscope (Eclipse TE300). Cell Fractionation—Nuclear protein extraction was carried out by using the nuclear extract kit (Active Motif). In brief, STG28-treated LNCaP cells were harvested in ice-cold hypotonic buffer for 15 min followed by 14,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected as cytoplasmic fraction, and the pellet was further incubated with complete lysis buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain supernatant as nuclear fraction. Protein concentrations were quantitated, and immunoblotting was performed for cyclin D1 detection. Nucleolin and β-actin served as markers and internal controls for nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, respectively. Transient Transfection and RNA Interference—Transfection was carried out by electroporation using an Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) according to a reported procedure (34Wei S. Lin L.F. Yang C.C. Wang Y.C. Chang G.D. Chen H. Chen C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, LNCaP cells were nucleofected with various plasmids by using the Nucleofector kit R (Amaxa), seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well), and incubated in 10% FBS-containing medium for 24 h before drug treatment. Transfection efficiency was >75% in LNCaP cells as determined by co-transfection with pmaxGFP plasmids followed by fluorescence microscopic visualization of the GFP-positive cells population. For small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, cells were electroporated with scrambled, IKKα (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), β-TrCP (Santa Cruz), or Fbxw8 (Origene, Rockville, MD) and seeded in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well). After exposure to 10 μm STG28, cell lysates were collected and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—LNCaP cells were nucleofected with 5 μg of plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged Cul1, Myc-tagged F-box proteins (β-TrCP, Skp2, or Fbw7) or various GFP-tagged cyclin D1 constructs and treated with 10 μm STG28 for different time intervals followed by 4 h of co-treatment with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 before harvest. After washing with PBS, drug-treated cells were cross-linked by incubating cells with dithiobis[succinimidyl-propionate] (150 μg/ml in PBS) for 1 h in 4°C. Dithiobis[succinimidyl-propionate] was then quenched by adding 100 μl of 1 m glycine for 15 min at 4 °C, and cells were lysed by commercial lysis buffer (M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent; Pierce) in the presence of a 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected, preincubated with protein A-agarose (Sigma) for 15 min, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. One-tenth of the supernatant was reserved as input, and the remainder was exposed to anti-cyclin D1 or anti-Myc antibodies in the presence of protein-A-agarose at 4 °C for 12 h. After a brief centrifugation, immunoprecipitates was washed, combined with an equal volume of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% brom-phenol blue), and boiled for 10 min. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer cell. The transblotted membrane was washed twice with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). After blocking with TBST containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (diluted 1:1000) in 1% TBST-nonfat milk at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with the primary antibody, the membrane was washed 3 times with TBST for a total of 30 min followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:2500) for 1 h at room temperature. After three thorough washes with TBST for a total of 30 min, the immunoblots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—LNCaP cells were nucleofected with 5 μg of HA-ubiquitin plasmids alone or in combination with β-TrCP-Myc plasmids, incubated in 6-well plates for 24 h, and treated with 10 μm STG28 for different time intervals followed by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 4 h. After harvest, cells were lysed by a 1% protease inhibitor mixture containing M-PER buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected, preincubated with protein A-agarose for 15 min, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. One-tenth of the supernatant was stored at 4 °C as input, and the remainder was incubated with anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) affinity matrix at 4 °C overnight. After a brief centrifugation, immunoprecipitates were collected, washed, suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against cyclin D1 and Myc. GST Fusion Protein Preparation—The GST-β-TrCP and GST-Skp2 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 3 h at 37°C. After centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 10 min, bacteria were pelleted, suspended with 10 ml STE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by sonication on ice for 10 s 5 times. The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 rpm and dissolved in 10 ml 1.5% N-laurylsarcosine (sarkosyl)-containing STE buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 20 min, supernatant were transferred and neutralized by adding 2% Triton X-100. Recombinant GST fusion protein were purified by incubating 200 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 30 min followed by 10 times ice-cold PBS washing. The fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione beads were used for the following GST pulldown assay. GST Pulldown Assay—LNCaP cells were nucleofected with GFP, wild-type cyclin D1-GFP, or E279A/E280A/T286A cyclin D1-GFP plasmids and incubated in 10% FBS-supplemental RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h. Cells were lysed by 1% protease inhibitor mixture-containing M-PER buffer and incubated with equal amounts of GST, GST-β-TrCP, or GST-Skp2-immobolized glutathione beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The incubation complexes were washed three times with M-PER buffer, and the resulting precipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against GFP and GST. Molecular Modeling—The interface structure between the β-TrCP1 WD40 domain and the doubly phosphorylated YLDSGIHSGAT motif of β-catenin was retrieved from the published crystal structure (38Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) (PDB code of 1P22), whereas the interface between the WD40 domain and cyclin D1 was a representative model structure calculated by an energy minimization using the Modeler program (39Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) with the CHARMM force field (40Mackerell Jr., A.D. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1584-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The β-catenin bound β-TrCP WD40 domain structure was first subjected to the addition of hydrogens and the assignment of atomic charges. The target 276EEEEEVDLACT286 motif in cyclin D1 was superimposed on the crystal structure of the YLDSGIHSGAT motif of β-catenin by using their sequence alignments and under the control of steric and electrostatic effects. Accordingly, molecular mechanical and dynamics simulations were carried out to delineate the interactions between cyclin D1 and the β-TrCP WD40 domain. STG28-induced Cyclin D1 Degradation Is Preceded by Cyclin D1 Phosphorylation and Nuclear Export Independently of GSK3β—Despite a lack of PPARγ activity, STG28 exhibited multifold higher potency in suppressing cyclin D1 expression than its parent compound troglitazone in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1A), which is in line with that noted in MCF-7 cells (32Huang J.W. Shiau C.W. Yang Y.T. Kulp S.K. Chen K.F. Brueggemeier R.W. Shapiro C.L. Chen C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that STG28 treatment also led to the degradation of β-catenin in LNCaP cells (34Wei S. Lin L.F. Yang C.C. Wang Y.C. Chang G.D. Chen H. Chen C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), raising a possibility that STG28-induced cyclin D1 repression might be attributable to the effect of decreased β-catenin expression on inhibiting cyclin D1 gene transcription (41Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). This mechanistic link, however, was refuted by two lines of evidence. First, although 10 μm STG28 suppressed cyclin D1 protein expression in a time-dependent manner, no appreciable changes in the mRNA level were noted (Fig. 1B, right panel), suggesting that STG28-induced cyclin D1 repression was mediated at the post-translational level. Second, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was effective in rescuing the drug-induced cyclin D1 ablation (Fig. 1B, left panel). The ability of STG28 to modulate the stability of cyclin D1 protein was confirmed by the significantly shortened half-life of cyclin D1 in drug-treated LNCaP cells relative to the untreated cells (≤20 min versus 60 min) (Fig. 1C). As ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 is preceded by phosphorylation and nuclear export (16Alao J.P. Mol. Cancer. 2007; 6: 24-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of STG28 (10 μm) on the phosphorylation state and cellular distribution of cyclin D1. Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses indicate that STG28-facilitated cyclin D1 repression was accompanied by increases in Thr-286 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D) and cytoplasmic sequestration of cyclin D1 (Fig. 1E, left panel) in a time-dependent manner. The nuclear export of cyclin D1 was further borne out by u"
https://openalex.org/W2007958820,"Aims Deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1), a member of RhoGTPase activating protein (GAP) family, is known to have suppressive activities in tumorigenicity and cancer metastasis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of how DLC1 suppresses cell motility have not been fully elucidated. Rho-kinase (ROCK) is an immediate down-stream effector of RhoA in mediating cellular cytoskeletal events and cell motility. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of DLC1 on Rho/ROCK signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrated that DLC1 negatively regulated ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility. From immumofluorescence study, we found that ectopic expression of DLC1 abrogated Rho/ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization including formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions. It also downregulated cortical phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2 (MLC2). These inhibitory events by DLC1 were RhoGAP-dependent, as RhoGAP-deficient mutant of DLC1 (DLC1 K714E) abolished these inhibitory events. In addition, from western study, DLC1 inhibited ROCK-related myosin light chain phosphatase targeting unit 1 (MYPT1) phosphorylation at Threonine 853. By examining cell morphology under microscope, we found that ectopic expression of dominant-active ROCK released cells from DLC1-induced cytoskeletal collapse and cell shrinkage. Conclusion Our data suggest that DLC1 negatively regulates Rho/ROCK/MLC2. This implicates a ROCK-mediated pathway of DLC1 in suppressing metastasis of HCC cells and enriches our understanding in the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2137070321,"Yersinia pestis, a Gram-negative bacterium that causes bubonic and pneumonic plague, is able to rapidly disseminate to other parts of its mammalian hosts. Y. pestis expresses plasminogen activator (PLA) on its surface, which has been suggested to play a role in bacterial dissemination. It has been speculated that Y. pestis hijacks antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages (MPhis) and dendritic cells, to be delivered to lymph nodes to initiate dissemination and infection. Both alveolar MPhis and pulmonary dendritic cells express a C-type lectin receptor, DEC-205 (CD205), which mediates antigen uptake and presentation. However, no ligand has been identified for DEC-205. In this study, we show that the invasion of alveolar MPhisby Y. pestis depends both in vitro and in vivo on the expression of PLA. DEC-205-expressing MPhis and transfectants, but not their negative counterparts, phagocytosed PLA-expressing Y. pestis and Escherichia coli K12 more efficiently than PLA-negative controls. The interactions between PLA-expressing bacteria and DEC-205-expressing transfectants or alveolar MPhis could be inhibited by an anti-DEC-205 antibody. Importantly, the blockage of the PLA-DEC-205 interaction reduced the dissemination of Y. pestis in mice. In conclusion, murine DEC-205 is a receptor for PLA of Y. pestis, and this host-pathogen interaction appears to play a key role in promoting bacterial dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2076845395,"Membrane skeletons are cytoskeletal elements that have important roles in cell development, shape, and structural integrity. Malaria parasites encode a conserved family of putative membrane skeleton proteins related to articulins. One member, IMC1a, is expressed in sporozoites and localizes to the pellicle, a unique membrane complex believed to form a scaffold onto which the ligands and glideosome are arranged to mediate parasite motility and invasion. IMC1b is a closely related structural paralogue of IMC1a, fostering speculation that it could be functionally homologous but in a different invasive life stage. Here we have generated genetically modified parasites that express IMC1b tagged with green fluorescent protein, and we show that it is targeted exclusively to the pellicle of ookinetes. We also show that IMC1b-deficient ookinetes display abnormal cell shape, reduced gliding motility, decreased mechanical strength, and reduced infectivity. These findings are consistent with a membrane skeletal role of IMC1b and provide strong experimental support for the view that membrane skeletons form an integral part of the pellicle of apicomplexan zoites and function to provide rigidity to the pellicular membrane complex. The similarities observed between the loss-of-function phenotypes of IMC1a and IMC1b show that membrane skeletons of ookinetes and sporozoites function in an overall similar way. However, the fact that ookinetes and sporozoites do not use the same IMC1 protein implies that different mechanical properties are required of their respective membrane skeletons, likely reflecting the distinct environments in which these life stages must operate."
https://openalex.org/W2090622884,"Differentiation of monocytes into macrophages is accompanied by increased cell adhesiveness, due in part to the activation of alpha4beta1 integrins. Here we report that the sustained alpha4beta1 activation associated with macrophage differentiation results from expression of beta1 integrin subunits that lack alpha2-6-linked sialic acids, a carbohydrate modification added by the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase. During differentiation of U937 monocytic cells and primary human CD14(+) monocytes, ST6Gal-I is down-regulated, leading to beta1 hyposialylation and enhanced alpha4beta1-dependent VCAM-1 binding. Importantly, ST6Gal-I down-regulation results from cleavage by the BACE1 secretase, which we show is dramatically up-regulated during macrophage differentiation. BACE1 up-regulation, ST6Gal-I shedding, beta1 hyposialylation, and alpha4beta1-dependent VCAM-1 binding are all temporally correlated and share the same signaling mechanism (protein kinase C/Ras/ERK). Preventing ST6Gal-I down-regulation (and therefore integrin hyposialylation), through BACE1 inhibition or ST6Gal-I constitutive overexpression, eliminates VCAM-1 binding. Similarly, preventing integrin hyposialylation inhibits a differentiation-induced increase in the expression of an activation-dependent conformational epitope on the beta1 subunit. Collectively, these results describe a novel mechanism for alpha4beta1 regulation and further suggest an unanticipated role for BACE1 in macrophage function."

Employing monoclonal antibodies that bind to the telopeptide region of a collagen molecule, we found that blocking telopeptide-mediated collagen/collagen interactions reduces the amount of collagen fibrils accumulated in vitro and in keloid-like organotypic constructs. We conclude that inhibiting extracellular steps of the fibrotic process provides a novel approach to limit fibrosis in a number of tissues and organs. We present a concept for reducing formation of fibrotic deposits by inhibiting self-assembly of collagen molecules into fibrils, a main component of fibrotic lesions. Employing monoclonal antibodies that bind to the telopeptide region of a collagen molecule, we found that blocking telopeptide-mediated collagen/collagen interactions reduces the amount of collagen fibrils accumulated in vitro and in keloid-like organotypic constructs. We conclude that inhibiting extracellular steps of the fibrotic process provides a novel approach to limit fibrosis in a number of tissues and organs. Collagen I is the most abundant structural protein of connective tissues such as skin, bone, and tendon. This protein is first synthesized as a precursor molecule, procollagen, that is characterized by the presence of a rod-like central triple-helical domain flanked by short linear telopeptides and globular N-terminal and C-terminal propeptides (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Single procollagen molecules are the building blocks for the biologically and mechanically relevant collagen fibrils. Formation of collagen fibrils is initiated by enzymatic cleavage of the N-terminal and the C-terminal propeptides. The N-terminal propeptides are cleaved by a group of enzymes that includes a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)-2, -3, and -14, whereas the C-terminal propeptides are cleaved by the metalloprotease bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) 2The abbreviations used are: BMP-1bone morphogenetic protein 1PBSphosphate-buffered saline. and by the other members of a closely related family of mammalian tolloid-like metalloproteases (2Colige A.

Such a removal of procollagen propeptides exposes telopeptides, which by engaging in site-specific intermolecular interactions drive collagen self-assembly. bone morphogenetic protein 1 phosphate-buffered saline. In native tissues a precise balance between the processes of biosynthesis and degradation maintains the physiological homeostasis of tissue collagens. At the same time, accelerated biosynthesis is required for proper wound healing, whereas excessive accumulation of collagen is the hallmark of a number of localized fibrotic diseases, such as keloids and hypertrophic scars, and systemic fibrosis, such as systemic scleroderma. Localized fibrotic reactions are quite common and frequently develop as a consequence of surgical procedures. For instance, after surgery of the abdomen, the formation of excessive scar tissue around abdominal organs, such as the intestines, can interfere with the functionality of such organs and may cause severe pain and even death. Another situation where excessive scar formation presents a major complication is in the eye after glaucoma surgery performed to create a pressure-maintenance valve. Frequently, however, excessive scar formation closes this pressure-reducing valve, thereby forcing the intraocular pressure to rise (5Addicks E.M. Quigley H.A. Green W.R. Robin A.L. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1983; 101: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Moreover, excessive scarring of the vocal folds may severely alter their ability to vibrate, thereby causing a number of voice disorders (6Lim X. Tateya I. Tateya T. Munoz-Del-Rio A. Bless D.M. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 2006; 115: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At present, several biological processes critical for development of fibrotic lesions are considered potential targets for inhibitors of fibrosis. These inhibitors aim at (i) reducing inflammatory processes associated with fibrosis, (ii) inhibiting biological functions of cytokines and growth factors that promote fibrosis, (iii) reducing cell proliferation, and (iv) decreasing biosynthesis and processing of procollagens. Because most of those potential targets are involved not only in pathological fibrosis but also in a number of physiological processes, their inhibition is frequently associated with significant adverse effects (7Roseborough I.E. Grevious M.A. Lee R.C. J. Natl. Med. Assoc. 2004; 96: 108-116PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sanders K.W. Gage-White L. Stucker F.J. Arch. Facial Plast.

Investig. 1980; 65: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here, we tested a new approach to reduce excessive scarring by specifically targeting the extracellular process of formation of collagen fibrils, a main component of fibrotic scars. By employing custom-designed antibodies that specifically bind to the C-terminal telopeptide of the α2-chain of collagen I, we demonstrated that blocking telopeptide-mediated collagen/collagen interaction limits accumulation of collagen fibrils in vitro and in organotypic constructs formed by keloid-derived fibroblasts. Because excessive deposition of collagen fibrils is characteristic of all fibrotic processes, we predict that the basic design for the inhibitors of collagen fibril formation we tested in a skin-based keloid model will be applicable for reducing a number of localized and systemic fibrotic changes in other tissues and organs as well. Purification of Human Procollagen I—Procollagen I was purified from cell culture media of normal human dermal fibroblasts, as described (12Fiedler-Nagy C. Bruckner P. Hayashi T. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 212: 668-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Romanic A.M. Adachi E. Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal Antibodies—Hybridomas were prepared by a commercial company (Abgent, Inc. San Diego, CA). Inhibitory antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide (GGGYDFGYDGDFYRA) whose sequence corresponds to that of the C-terminal telopeptide of the α2 chain (α2Ct). Initial screening of these antibodies produced by various hybridoma clones was done with synthetic α2Ct. Finally, the specificity of selected antibodies to bind a native epitope was tested against intact human procollagen I and against enzymatically processed procollagen I. In brief, purified procollagen I was processed by BMP-1 (R&D Systems), lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C; Roche Applied Science) or pepsin (Sigma-Aldrich), as described (14Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Hojima Y. Ganguly A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Steplewski A. Ito H. Rucker E. Brittingham R.J. Alabyeva T. Gandhi M. Ko F.K. Birk D.E. Jimenez S.A. Fertala A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Note that enzymatic cleavage of procollagen I with BMP-1 or Lys-C leaves telopeptide regions intact, whereas digestion of procollagen with pepsin degrades the telopeptides. At the same time, digestion with all enzymes employed here preserves the triple-helical region of collagen I. Intact procollagen I and products of its enzymatic cleavage were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels in denaturing conditions. Subsequently, protein bands were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and detected with primary anti-α2Ct antibody and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, the protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. The ability of the anti-α2Ct antibody to interact with a native antigen was also tested by applying unprocessed procollagen I and products of its enzymatic digestion directly onto nitrocellulose membranes and detecting these proteins as described above. Moreover, to ensure the lack of any cross-reactivity of analyzed antibodies with employed enzymes, BMP-1, Lys-C, and pepsin alone were also loaded onto nitrocellulose membranes. Monoclonal antibody, described by Fisher et al. (16Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 61-65Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar) as LF-41, was raised against a peptide (PLDVGAPDQEFGFDVGPVCFL) that corresponds to the C-terminal propeptide of the pro-α1 chain of procollagen I (α1Cp). Specificity of the anti-α1Cp antibody to recognize the native epitopes was tested in a way similar to that described for the anti-α2Ct antibody. Purification of Monoclonal Antibodies—Isotyping of antibodies was performed by Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA. The anti-α2Ct monoclonal antibody (an IgA isoform with kappa light chains) produced by a selected hybridoma clone was purified from cell culture media. In brief, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with reduced IgG content (Ultra-Low IgG fetal bovine serum, Invitrogen). About 10 liters of cell culture medium was collected and filtered through glass fiber filters (Millipore, Inc.) to remove cell debris. Subsequently, a protein fraction that included immunoglobulins was precipitated with a 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate. A protein pellet was collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in a buffer consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 120 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3. The anti-α2Ct monoclonal antibody was finally purified by affinity chromatography on a Protein-L column (Pierce). Column-bound IgA was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.0. Collected fractions were immediately neutralized with a buffer consisting of 1.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, and 25 mm EDTA. The purity of the antibody was determined by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. The anti-α1Cp antibody (an IgG type) was prepared in a similar way, but instead of Protein-L, Protein-G was employed for purification (Pierce). Purified antibodies were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at –80 °C. Cleavage of Procollagen I by BMP-1 in the Presence of Anti-α2Ct Antibody—Because the anti-α2Ct antibody was designed to bind the C-terminal α2 telopeptide, we tested whether its binding would interfere with the enzymatic activity of BMP-1, an enzyme that specifically cleaves procollagen I at the C telopeptide/C propeptide junction (17Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples containing 50 μg/ml procollagen I and 1.2 or 0.2 μg/ml purified anti-α2Ct antibody solubilized in a buffer supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2 were incubated for 0.5 h at room temperature. Subsequently, recombinant BMP-1 at a concentration of 25 μg/ml was added to the procollagen I-antibody mixtures, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C. At defined time points aliquots were withdrawn and boiled with a protein-loading buffer. After collecting all samples, the products of cleavage of procollagen I by BMP-1 were separated in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (BioSafe Coomassie, Bio-Rad). Subsequently, employing a computer program, the pixel intensities of bands corresponding to substrates and products of enzymatic digestion were determined (ImageQuant, GE Healthcare). Data from three independent measurements were used to derive rates of cleavage of procollagen I. In addition, samples that contained the anti-α1Cp antibody and those with no antibodies were prepared and analyzed in a similar way. To exclude the possibility of the presence of any nonspecific proteolytic activities derived from enzymes that could co-purify with procollagen itself or with antibodies, in one set of experiments we employed EDTA, an inhibitor of BMP-1. In brief, samples containing procollagen I, BMP-1, and antibodies were prepared as described above. EDTA was added to these samples to a final concentration of 10 mm. Subsequently, the samples were incubated for 4 h at 37°C and then they were analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described above. Fibril Formation Assays in Vitro—De novo collagen fibril formation assays were employed to analyze the inhibitory effect of the anti-α2Ct antibody on collagen fibril formation in vitro, as described (15Steplewski A. Ito H. Rucker E. Brittingham R.J. Alabyeva T. Gandhi M. Ko F.K. Birk D.E. Jimenez S.A. Fertala A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Fertala A.

In these assays self-assembly of collagen monomers into fibrils is initiated by enzymatic digestion of procollagen propeptides. In brief, procollagen I at a concentration 230 μg/ml was digested with Lys-C (1 μg/ml) for 0.5 h at 25 °C, experimental conditions in which formation of collagen fibrils does not occur (21Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After initial incubation, a possible enzymatic digestion of Lys-C-sensitive antibodies was inhibited by Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK, Sigma-Aldrich) added to a final concentration of 1 mm (19Ito H. Rucker E. Steplewski A. McAdams E. Brittingham R.J. Alabyeva T. Fertala A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Elliott Jr., B.W. Cohen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11259-11265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the anti-α2Ct antibody was added to the Lys-C-processed collagen samples at concentrations of 180 or 10 μg/ml to achieve collagen/antibody molar ratios of about 1:2 or 10:1, respectively. Samples were incubated for 0.5 h at room temperature followed by incubation at 37 °C. To determine the kinetics of fibril formation, samples were analyzed at defined time points, as described (14Fertala A. Sieron A.L. Hojima Y. Ganguly A. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11584-11589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, fibril incorporated collagen was separated from the soluble collagen monomers by centrifugation. Supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and a fibril-containing pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. After boiling all samples with a protein loading buffer, pellet and supernatant collagen fractions were electrophoresed in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Subsequently, protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue, and the pixel intensities of bands corresponding to the collagen α-chains present in a pellet or in a supernatant fraction were determined by densitometry. Data from independent studies were plotted to determine rates of fibril formation, as described (23Gelman R.A. Williams B.R. Piez K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 180-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibril formation studies in the presence of the anti-α1Cp antibody and those with no antibodies were carried out in a similar way. Microscopic Analyses of Morphology of Individual Collagen Fibrils—For ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy, the collagen fibrils were processed as described (18Fertala A. Holmes D.F. Kadler K.E. Sieron A.L. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14864-14869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, 10-μl samples containing fibrils formed for 24 h were transferred onto 200-mesh Formvar-supported and carbon-coated copper grids (Ted Pella, Inc.). Collagen fibrils deposited on the grids were stained negatively with 1% phosphotungstate (pH 7.0) and visualized by a transmission electron microscope operating at 75 kV (model H-7000, Hitashi Ltd., Japan). Organotypic Cultures of Keloid-derived Fibroblasts—To test the ability of the anti-α2Ct antibody to limit collagen fibril formation in vivo, we employed a system that utilizes keloid-derived fibroblasts cultured in a three-dimensional environment. Keloid fibroblasts from patients undergoing elective surgery were obtained from the Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Biology Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin, and l-ascorbic acid phosphate magnesium salt n-hydrate at a concentration of 40 μg/ml (WAKO Inc., Japan). The organotypic constructs were prepared by employing three-dimensional sponge-like scaffolds fabricated from polylactic acid (OPLA, BD Biosciences). Cells were seeded dynamically into scaffolds by a method adopted from Wang et al. (24Wang H.J. Bertrand-de Haas M. van Blitterswijk C.A. Lamme E.N. Tissue Eng. 2003; 9: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In brief, the scaffolds were placed into cell culture chambers of a bioreactor (Sythecon, Inc.) filled with cell suspension containing 2 × 105 cells/ml, and the cells were allowed to populate scaffolds for 7 days with the culture chambers rotating at 20 rpm. For fibril formation assay, in vitro individual scaffolds were transferred into wells of low-cell adhesion culture plates (Corning, Inc.) and placed into a cell culture incubator onto a platform rotating at 80 rpm. Each day cell culture media supplemented with the tested antibody at a concentration of 70 μg/ml was exchanged in each well. After 2 weeks of culture, samples were collected and prepared for analysis. Inhibition of collagen deposition was also tested in organotypic constructs implanted subcutaneously into nude mice (Nude-Foxn1nu, HARLAN). After 7 days of incubation in cell culture chambers, four constructs seeded with keloid fibroblasts were implanted subcutaneously into an athymic nude mouse. Subsequently, two of those constructs received a 100-μl dose of an inhibitory antibody present at a concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, injected every 3 days directly into the scaffold and the surrounding area. Two remaining constructs received injections of equal amounts of PBS. After 1 month, the mice were sacrificed, and the scaffolds were prepared for biochemical and morphological analyses. In the first set of experiments, in which the organotypic cultures were grown in cell culture conditions, one control group received the anti-α1Cp antibody treatment, and the second one was treated with PBS only. Because of the limits in supply of the anti-α1Cp antibody in studies with the subcutaneous implants, the only control group was the one receiving PBS injections. Analysis of the Total Collagen Content in Keloid-like Constructs—Scaffolds were rinsed with PBS, cut into two portions, and then lyophilized. Subsequently, the dry mass of lyophilized samples was measured. Next, one portion of a scaffold was hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl, and the hydroxyproline concentration was analyzed to determine collagen content, as described (25Woessner J.F. Archiv. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 93: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar). The remaining portion of a scaffold was utilized to determine the total protein content. Microscopic Analyses of Organotypic Keloid-like Constructs—Keloid-like constructs were harvested and then processed for histology and electron microscopy analyses. The samples were stained for collagen deposits with Sirius red. In addition, the human origin of cells present in the constructs grown subcutaneously in mice was confirmed by immunostaining with anti-human vimentin-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The stained samples were observed under a microscope equipped with a digital camera (model Eclipse E600, Nikon, Japan). For electron microscopy, the samples were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% tannic acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Inc.). Subsequently, the samples were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetraoxide in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, rinsed in distilled water, and then stained with 1% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). After that, the samples were embedded in 3% agarose followed by dehydration in graded concentrations of acetone. Next, the samples were embedded in Spurr's resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). After polymerization, blocks of samples were sectioned to 70-nm sections with a diamond knife (Diatome, AG, Switzerland) mounted on a Leica Ultracut UCT microtome (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Finally, the sections were post-stained with 2.5% uranyl acetate in 50% ethanol and sodium bismuth (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and then observed with a transmission electron microscope (model H-7000, Hitashi Ltd., Japan). Statistics—Collected data were analyzed, and results are presented as the mean ± S.E. for each sample. Comparisons between control groups and other groups were performed by an unpaired, two-tailed t test. In experiments with keloid-like constructs grown subcutaneously in mice, a paired t test was employed. In all tests the α level was set to 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism Version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Epitope Specificity of Monoclonal Antibodies—Monoclonal anti-α1Cp and anti-α2Ct antibodies were purified from cell culture media of selected hybridomas. The monoclonal anti-α2Ct antibodies were an IgA type with the kappa light chains, whereas the anti-α1Cp antibody belonged to the IgG class. As determined by Western blot assays, monoclonal antibodies produced by selected hybridoma clones specifically recognized their respective epitopes (Figs. 1 and 2). In particular, the anti-α2Ct antibody-specific signal was apparent only in collagen variants in which the telopeptides were intact. Specifically, a group of collagen variants interacting with the anti-α2Ct antibody included intact procollagen I and procollagen processed with BMP-1 or with Lys-C (Fig. 1c). Moreover, we observed that the α2Ct-specific signal was stronger for a partially processed pro-α2 chain than the signal for the intact pro-α2 chain, suggesting more unrestricted access of the tested antibody to the target telopeptide in the absence of the C-terminal propeptide (Fig. 1c). There was no apparent signal from the pepsin-digested collagen I in which telopeptides were enzymatically degraded (Fig. 1c).FIGURE 2Slot blot analysis of the specificity of recognition of native epitopes by the anti-α1Cp and anti-α2Ct antibodies. Panel a shows results of assays of binding of the anti-α1Cp antibody to native procollagen I and to the products of its cleavage with BMP-1, Lys-C, or pepsin. Panel b depicts results of analyses of binding of the anti-α2Ct antibody to the same proteins. In addition, both panels show the lack of binding of analyzed antibodies to BMP-1, Lys-C, and pepsin. Pro, procollagen I; + indicates samples digested with BMP-1, Lys-C, or pepsin; asterisks indicate positions of proteins present on nitrocellulose membranes but not detected by analyzed antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similarly, the anti-α1Cp antibody specifically recognized the C propeptide of the α1 chain of procollagen I. As indicated in Fig. 1b, the α1 C propeptides present in the intact procollagen as well as C propeptides cleaved by BMP-1 or Lys-C were recognized by the anti-α1Cp antibody. There was an apparent difference in molecular masses of products generated by digestion of the C propeptides with Lys-C and BMP-1, most likely due to the differences in location of the specific cleavage sites recognized by these enzymes (Fig. 1b). The lack of binding of the anti-α1Cp antibody to the pepsin-treated procollagen in which the C propeptides were degraded provides even more evidence for its epitope-specific binding (Fig. 1b). As determined by slot-blot assays, both the anti-α1Cp and anti-α2Ct antibodies were able to interact with native epitopes (Fig. 2). Specifically, the antibodies interacted with the intact procollagen I and with products generated by cleavage of procollagen I with BMP-1 or Lys-C. In contrast, the product generated by digestion with pepsin was not recognized by analyzed antibodies. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the enzymes themselves did not react with tested antibodies. Processing of the C Propeptide by BMP-1 in Vitro in the Presence of the Anti-α2Ct Antibody—Because the anti-α2Ct antibody binds to the C-terminal telopeptide, we tested whether its binding could hinder BMP-1 cleavage of the Ala-Asp bond present at the C telopeptide/C propeptide junction (Fig. 3). As demonstrated in Table 1, the presence of the anti-α2Ct antibody decreased the rate of cleavage of procollagen chains in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Under the same conditions, there was no statistically significant difference between the rates of cleavage of procollagen α chains by BMP-1 in control samples containing the anti-α1Cp antibody and those to which no antibody was added (Fig. 3 and Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of results on inhibitory effects of the anti-α2Ct antibody on BMP-1 cleavage, kinetics of fibril formation, and accumulation of collagen in keloid-like constructsControl(+) Anti-α2Ct(+) Anti-α1CpMean ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Employing EDTA, we determined that there was no proteolytic activity other than that derived from BMP-1. In particular, in the presence of EDTA there was not any detectable cleavage of procollagen I (Fig. 3d). Kinetics of Self-assembly of Collagen and Morphology of Fibrils Formed in Vitro in the Presence of the Anti-α2Ct Antibody—In a number of in vitro assays it has been established that de novo fibril formation, i.e. where individual collagen molecules derived from enzyme-processed procollagen self-assemble into fibrils, is characterized by distinct phases of nucleation, propagation, and equilibrium (21Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, in vitro fibril formation assays demonstrated that binding of the anti-α2Ct antibody to the C-terminal α2 telopeptide decreased both the rate of fibril formation and the amount of accumulated collagen fibrils (Fig. 4a, Table 1). By employing various concentrations of inhibitory antibodies, we demonstrated that the decrease in the rates of fibril formation and in the amounts of accumulated fibrils at equilibrium was concentration-dependent (Table 1). In contrast, the presence of the anti-α1Cp antibody did not have any significant effects on the kinetics of fibril assembly or on the total amount of accumulated fibrils (Fig. 4a, Table 1). In addition to electrophoretic assays of the kinetics of formation of fi"
https://openalex.org/W2018261512,"Binding of interleukin-6 (IL-6) to its specific receptor IL-6R is a prerequisite for the activation of the signal-transducing receptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130). A soluble form of the IL-6R (sIL-6R) in complex with IL-6 can activate cells lacking membrane-bound IL-6R (trans-signaling). IL-6-trans-signaling is counterbalanced by a naturally occurring, soluble form of gp130 (sgp130), whereby signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R is not affected. Many inflammatory and neoplastic disorders are driven by IL-6 trans-signaling. By analysis of the three-dimensional structure of gp130 in complex with IL-6 and sIL-6R, we identified amino acid side chains in gp130 as candidates for the generation of sgp130 muteins with increased binding affinity to IL-6/sIL-6R. In addition, with information from modeling and NMR analysis of the membrane proximal domain of gp130, we generated a more stable variant of sgp130Fc. Proteins were tested for binding to the IL-6/sIL-6R-complex, for inhibition of IL-6/sIL-6R-induced cell proliferation and of acute phase gene expression. Several mutations showed an additive effect in improving the binding affinity of human sgp130 toward human IL-6/sIL-6R. Finally, we demonstrate the species specificity of these mutations in the optimal triple mutein (T102Y/Q113F/N114L) both in vitro and in a mouse model of acute inflammation.

Many inflammatory and neoplastic disorders are driven by IL-6 trans-signaling. By analysis of the three-dimensional structure of gp130 in complex with IL-6 and sIL-6R, we identified amino acid side chains in gp130 as candidates for the generation of sgp130 muteins with increased binding affinity to IL-6/sIL-6R. In addition, with information from modeling and NMR analysis of the membrane proximal domain of gp130, we generated a more stable variant of sgp130Fc. Proteins were tested for binding to the IL-6/sIL-6R-complex, for inhibition of IL-6/sIL-6R-induced cell proliferation and of acute phase gene expression. Several mutations showed an additive effect in improving the binding affinity of human sgp130 toward human IL-6/sIL-6R. Finally, we demonstrate the species specificity of these mutations in the optimal triple mutein (T102Y/Q113F/N114L) both in vitro and in a mouse model of acute inflammation. The members of the interleukin (IL) 2The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. -6 cytokine family include, besides IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-11, IL-27, IL-31, oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-like related cytokine (CLC), neurotrophin-1/B-cell-stimulating factor 3 (NNT-1), neuropoietin (NPN), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (1.Hibi M. Nakajima K. Hirano T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2.Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane protein gp130 is the common β-receptor subunit and signal transducer of the whole family (3.Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). The usage of gp130 together with specific α-receptors (IL-6R, IL-11R, CNTFR, CLF-1) and other β-receptors (LIFR, OSMR, GPL, and Wsx1) as signal transducers is responsible for the overlapping and in part distinct cellular functions described for IL-6 type cytokines (for detailed reviews see Refs. 1.Hibi M. Nakajima K. Hirano T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2.Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). gp130 belongs to the class of tall cytokine receptors, which exhibit three fibronectin-type III-like domains between their ligand binding domains and transmembrane domains (4.Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Soluble forms of gp130 are generated by alternative splicing and are found in the plasma of healthy individuals at concentrations of 100-200 ng/ml (5.Narazaki M. Yasukawa K. Saito T. Ohsugi Y. Fukui H. Koishihara Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Blood. 1993; 82: 1120-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 signals via a complex of IL-6, IL-6-α-receptor (IL-6R), and two gp130 molecules (2.Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that leads to the transcription of target genes, such as acute phase response genes in hepatocytes (6.Scheller J. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Signal Transduct. 2006; 6: 240-259Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). IL-6-type cytokines are involved in proliferation and differentiation processes, predominantly in the hematopoietic system, in neural cells and in the immune response (1.Hibi M. Nakajima K. Hirano T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2.Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-6 has major functions in inflammatory reactions of the body (1.Hibi M. Nakajima K. Hirano T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2.Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice with a targeted inactivation of the IL-6 gene are protected of rheumatoid arthritis (8.Alonzi T. Fattori E.

Papoian R. Serlupi-Crescenzi O. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and multiple sclerosis (10.Okuda Y. Sakoda S. Bernard C.C. Fujimura H. Saeki Y. Kishimoto T. Yanagihara T. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Furthermore, regenerative reactions like wound healing and liver regeneration are severely compromised in IL-6-/- mice (11.Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The expression of the IL-6R is limited mainly to hepatocytes and some leukocytes (12.Rose-John S. Scheller J. Elson G. Jones S. J. Leuk. Biol. 2006; 80: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Cells lacking IL-6R expression are not responsive to the cytokine IL-6. A soluble form of the IL-6R, however, can bind IL-6 with the same affinity as the membrane-bound form, and the complex of IL-6 and the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) can induce signaling in a process called trans-signaling (13.Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 14.Peters M. Müller A. Rose-John S. Blood. 1998; 92: 3495-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the IL-6R is only sparely expressed, IL-6 trans-signaling dramatically increases the number of potential IL-6 target cells (12.Rose-John S. Scheller J. Elson G. Jones S. J. Leuk. Biol. 2006; 80: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). We have shown that the naturally occurring soluble form of gp130 selectively inhibits IL-6 responses mediated by the soluble IL-6R without affecting responses via the membrane-bound IL-6R (15.Jostock T. Müllberg J. Özbek S. Atreya R. Blinn G. Voltz N. Fischer M. Neurath M.F. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 16.Atreya R. Mudter J.

Kishimoto T. Galle P.R. Rose-John S. Neurath M.F. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Recently it has been found that inhibition of the inflammatory cytokines TNFα (17.Feldmann M. Maini R.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 163-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) and IL-6 (18.Nishimoto N. Yoshizaki K. Miyasaka N. Yamamoto K. Kawai S. Takeuchi T. Hashimoto J. Azuma J. Kishimoto T. Arth. Rheum. 2004; 50: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases can have dramatic therapeutic effects. More than 1 million patients have been treated so far with TNFα-neutralizing agents (19.Feldmann M. Steinman L. Nature. 2005; 435: 612-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Global blockade of cytokines, however, is hampered by side effects including recurrent infections, highlighting the fact that cytokines exhibit pro- and anti-inflammatory properties (20.Steinman L. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). A fusion protein consisting of the extracellular region of gp130 and the Fc part of a human IgG1 antibody (sgp130Fc) selectively inhibits IL-6 trans-signaling without affecting responses via the membrane-bound IL-6R. Therefore, this protein preferentially inhibits pro-inflammatory activities of IL-6, as it has been postulated that IL-6 signaling via the membrane-bound receptor mainly contributes to anti-inflammatory reactions, whereas IL-6-trans-signaling mediates pro-inflammatory and chronic inflammatory states (21.Rose-John S. Schooltink H. Rec. Res. Cancer Res. 2007; 174: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The structure of the extracellular portion of gp130 (domains 1-3) in complex with IL-6 and the extracellular part of the IL-6R (domains 2 and 3) has been solved by x-ray crystallography (22.Chow D.-C. He X.-L. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 23.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We have inspected the contact areas between IL-6 and gp130 and have identified several amino acid side chains as candidates for site-directed mutagenesis to improve the ligand binding properties of gp130. It turned out that only mutations within the contact area to site III of IL-6 improved binding of gp130 to the IL-6/sIL-6R complex, whereas changes within the contact region to site II of IL-6 resulted in decreased binding. In a previous study, we have shown that sgp130Fc tends to form large amounts of aggregates (24.Schroers A. Hecht O. Kallen K.J. Pachta M. Rose-John S. Grötzinger J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on the three-dimensional model structure of the extracellular domain 6 of gp130 (25.Pachta M. Dissertation. University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany2004Google Scholar), we generated an optimized version with a higher stability and a much lower tendency to form aggregates. Here, we demonstrate that one of the mutated sgp130Fc proteins with only three amino acid exchanges is far more effective in blocking different biologic responses mediated by the IL-6/sIL-6R complex in vitro. Moreover, using an animal model of acute inflammation, which is driven by the IL-6/sIL-6R complex (26.Chalaris A. Rabe B. Paliga K. Lange H. Laskay T. Fielding C.A. Jones S.A. Rose-John S. Scheller J. Blood. 2007; 110: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 27.Rabe B. Chalaris A. May U. Waetzig G.H. Seegert D. Williams A.S. Jones S.A. Rose-John S. Scheller J. Blood. 2008; 111: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we show that the sgp130Fc mutein is effective in blocking the progression of the inflammation from an acute to a chronic state. Our study therefore provides a general strategy to improve the efficacy of proteins, which are candidates for therapeutic applications. Constructs—The sgp130Fc protein was produced as described (15.Jostock T. Müllberg J. Özbek S. Atreya R. Blinn G. Voltz N. Fischer M. Neurath M.F. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The optimized sgp130Fc containing a C-terminal extended part of the extracellular region of gp130 (amino acids 1-595) was fused to the Fc part (15.Jostock T. Müllberg J. Özbek S. Atreya R. Blinn G. Voltz N. Fischer M. Neurath M.F. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Muteins with single amino acid substitutions or combinations thereof were generated by overlapping primer PCR within three cassettes flanked by endonuclease restriction sites (XhoI/SspI, SspI/BclI, BclI/KpnI, respectively). These constructs were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cell Culture—COS-7, HepG2, and CHO-K1 were from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). BAF3 cells (murine pre-B-cells) stably transfected with human gp130 (BAF3/gp130 cells) have been described previously (28.Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Brakenhoff J.P. Kallen K.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 145-148Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 29.Vollmer P. Oppmann B. Voltz N. Fischer M. Rose-John S. Eur .J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All cells except CHO-K1 were grown in DMEM High Glucose Culture Medium (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (60 mg/liter), and streptomycin (100 mg/liter) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. BAF3/gp130 medium was supplemented with 10 ng/ml Hyper-IL6 (28.Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Brakenhoff J.P. Kallen K.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 145-148Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar). After transient DEAE transfection, COS7 and HepG2 cells were grown with 0.5% FBS, and supernatants were harvested after 3 and 6 days (30.McMahan C.J. Slack J.L. Mosley B. Cosman D. Lupton S.D. Brunton L.L. Grubin C.E. Wignall J.M. Jenkins N.A. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Cannizzarro L.A. Benjamin D. Dower S.K. Spriggs M.K. Sims J.E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2821-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were grown in Ham's F12 medium (PAA) supplemented with 5% IgG-stripped FBS (PAA), 60 mg/liter penicillin and 100 mg/liter streptomycin. CHO-K1 cells were stably transfected with sgp130Fc cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and clones were selected with G418 (0.4 mg/ml, PAA). Protein Purification—Cell supernatants were subjected to affinity chromatography (protein A-Sepharose (Roche Applied Sciences, Mannheim, Germany)) and eluted by 5 column volumes of 50 mm citric acid. Relevant fractions were concentrated, and the buffer exchanged for phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using PD10 columns (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). The proteins were further purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 HR (16/60) column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min PBS. Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected, pooled, and concentrated. Protein concentrations were determined by recording absorption spectra in the range from 240 to 320 nm (31.Waxman E. Rusinova E. Hasselbacher C.A. Schwartz G.P. Laws W.R. Ross J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). sgp130Fc ELISA and Hyper-IL-6 Titration Assay—The concentration of sgp130Fc and muteins derived from cell supernatants was measured by ELISA. Plates (Maxisorp, Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) were coated with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml protein A (Sigma) for 5 h at room temperature and blocked overnight at 4 °C with 3% BSA and 5% sucrose in PBS. Supernatants were diluted 1:20 in 1% BSA plus 0.5% FBS in PBS, and 200 μl of the dilution were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were blocked with 5% human serum (PAA) for 30 min to saturate residual protein A binding sites. Plates were then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and incubated with 100 μl of anti-human CD130 antibody (B-P4, Diaclone Research, Stamford, CT) diluted 1:5,000 in 1% BSA plus 1% FBS in PBS for 2 h. Detection was performed with anti-mouse IgG POD (ImmunoPure, Pierce) at 1:5,000 in 1% BSA plus 1% FBS in PBS for 1 h, the assay was developed with BM blue POD substrate (Roche Applied Science) and finally terminated by adding 1 m H2SO4 followed by measurement at 450 nm. In a second round, equal amounts of sgp130Fc proteins in the supernatant were loaded and incubated with 1 ng/well Hyper-IL-6 for 1 h. Hyper-IL-6 was detected with the biotinylated anti-human IL-6R antibody BAF277 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at a 1:2,500 dilution and streptavidin-POD conjugate (Roche Applied Science) at 1:5,000 in 1% BSA in PBS. Proliferation Assay—Proliferation of BAF3/gp130 cells in response to Hyper-IL-6 or the human or murine IL-6/IL-6R complex (all components purchased from R&D Systems) and its inhibition by sgp130Fc, and the muteins was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (32.Kallen K.-J. Grötzinger J. Lelièvre E. Vollmer P. Aasland D. Renné C. Müllberg J. Meyer zum Büschenfelde K.-H. Gascan H. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11859-11867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Cell Titer Blue fluorescence assay or Cell Titer MTS colorimetric assay (both from Promega, Mannheim, Germany). For this purpose, 5 × 103 BAF3/gp130 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates and cultured in a final volume of 100 μl. Proliferation was induced by adding 1 ng/ml Hyper-IL-6 or 100 ng/ml human IL-6 plus 50 ng/ml human sIL-6R or 300 ng/ml murine IL-6 plus 150 ng/ml murine sIL-6R. The assay was performed with each value being determined in quadruplicate. Native Polyacrylamide Gel Analysis—Native PAGE was carried out in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels with a Tris/HCl buffer system (pH 6.8 in the glycerol sample buffer and the stacking gel, pH 8.8 in the separating gel). Gels were run in a buffer of 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine at a constant voltage of 60 V until the samples had completely entered the stacking gel, then at 80 V for 4-5 h. Proteins were subsequently fixed and silver-stained according to standard procedures. Western Blot Analysis—After SDS-PAGE and transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare), Western blot analysis was performed using a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (ImmunoPure anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase from goat, Pierce). Membranes were developed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL plus kit (GE Healthcare). The gp130 part of sgp130Fc was detected by the monoclonal mouse antibody anti-human CD130 clone B-P4 (Diaclone), which recognizes domain 4 of gp130. Haptoglobin ELISA—An ELISA to detect the human acute phase protein haptoglobin was performed as described (33.Oppmann B. Stoyan T. Fischer M. Voltz N. März P. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 195: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 HepG2 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates and left to adhere overnight. Cells were washed twice with PBS (37 °C) and starved in DMEM without FBS for 2 h. In the mean-time, sgp130Fc and muteins were diluted and mixed with 5 ng/ml Hyper-IL-6 in DMEM without FBS and placed in the incubator for at least 30 min. Cells were incubated with 200 μl of cytokine mixture for 20 h, and the amount of haptoglobin in the cell supernatant was determined by ELISA. Each value was determined in quadruplicate. Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—Plasmon resonance experiments were carried out with a ProteOn XPR36 protein interaction array system (Bio-Rad). The running buffer was PBS) with 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (PBST), and experiments were carried out at 25 °C. The surface of a ProteOn GLC sensor chip was activated with the ProteOn amine coupling kit (4 mm EDAC/1 mm sulfo-NHS, flow rate 30 μl/min, volume 40 μl), and proteins were covalently coupled at 10 μg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer pH 4.5 (flow rate 30 μl/min, volume 150 μl). The respective levels of immobilization were 2,250 RU (resonance units) for sgp130Fc, 1,330 RU for the optimized sgp130Fc and 1,120 RU for mutein XIII. The concentrations of Hyper-IL-6 ranged from 80 to 2.5 nm in 2-fold dilutions in PBST, and the flow rate was 100 μl/min. Association was monitored for 60 s before replacing the sample by PBST and monitoring the dissociation phase for another 600 s. Each sensogram set was referenced using the reference channel and was baseline-aligned. Sensograms were analyzed using the ProteOn Manager 2.0 software. Animal Treatment—All procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in accordance to national and international laws and policies as well as the guidelines for animal care of the University of Kiel (acceptance no.: V 742-72241.121-3 (20-2/04) and (76-7/00)). Mice were maintained in a 12-h light/dark cycle under standard conditions and were provided with food and water ad libitum. Blood was drawn by tail bleeding or by cardiac puncture under general anesthesia. Air Pouch Model—The air pouch model of local inflammation was performed with C57Bl/6 mice (34.Edwards J.C. Sedgwick A.D. Willoughby D.A. J. Pathol. 1981; 134: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In brief, mice were anesthetized and subcutaneous dorsal pouches were created by injection of 6 ml of sterile air. After 3 days, the pouches were reinjected with 4 ml of air. On day 6, 1 ml of 1% carrageenan (Sigma-Aldrich) in sterile PBS was injected into the pouches. sgp130Fc wild-type protein or muteins (10 μg/mouse) or PBS were administered intraperitoneally 6 h before the carrageenan injection. Seventy-two hours after treatment, animals were sacrificed, and the pouches were washed with 3 ml of PBS. The lavage fluid was immediately cooled on ice and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells contained in the lavage fluid were analyzed by FACS (see below), and the supernatant was analyzed by ELISA for MCP-1 (DuoSet mouse MCP-1 ELISA Kit, R&D Systems) and sgp130Fc (DuoSet human sgp130 ELISA Kit, R&D Systems). Flow Cytometry Analysis—Aliquots of the air pouch lavage fluid containing 2 × 105 cells were used for FACS analysis (FACS-Canto, Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). The mAbs Ly-6G (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany) and F4/80 (Invitrogen) were used to count neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. Data were acquired from 10,000 gated events. Molecular Modeling—To construct a model of the mouse IL-6/mouse IL-6R/human gp130 complex, the recently published structure of the human IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex was used as a template (23.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). According to the published alignment, amino acid residues of IL-6 and IL-6R were exchanged in the template (35.Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Insertions and deletions in the molecules were modeled using a data base search approach included in the software package WHATIF (36.Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3377) Google Scholar). For graphical representations, the program RIBBONS (37.Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar) was used. Selection of Amino Acid Exchanges—IL-6 interacts with three receptor subunits (38.Grötzinger J. Kernebeck T. Kallen K.-J. Rose-John S. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 39.Boulanger M.J. Garcia K.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 68: 107-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Site I is occupied by the specific IL-6R and site II is in contact with the cytokine binding module (domains 2 and 3) of gp130, whereas site III interacts with the Ig-like domain 1 (D1) of gp130 (Fig. 1, A and B) (23.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). When analyzing the three-dimensional structure of gp130 (D1-D3) in complex with IL-6 and the extracellular portion of the IL-6R, we focused on hydrophilic amino acid residues in gp130 participating in the interaction with IL-6 or IL-6R. Such residues were exchanged to hydrophobic side chains to achieve larger hydrophobic interaction areas and thereby increasing the affinity between the two molecules. The amino acid residue S251E was chosen to establish an additional salt bridge between gp130 and IL-6. As indicated in Fig. 1A, the amino acid side chains Ser-251, Ser-279, Thr-285, and Lys-303 of gp130 are in contact with site II of IL-6, whereas amino acid side chains Thr-102, Gly-109, Gln-113 and Asn-114 of gp130 are in the contact region to site III of IL-6. In addition, combinations of all these mutations were generated (Fig. 1A). Binding to Hyper-IL-6—The sgp130Fc cDNA and the mutated cDNAs were cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors and were used to transiently transfect HepG2 cells. For testing protein ability to bind Hyper-IL-6, a fusion protein of IL-6 and IL-6R (28.Fischer M. Goldschmitt J. Peschel C. Brakenhoff J.P. Kallen K.J. Wollmer A. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 145-148Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar), crude supernatants from these cells were used (Fig. 2A) and tested by ELISA. Equal amounts of sgp130Fc protein were captured from the supernatants of transfected HepG2 cells by immobilized protein A. After incubation with Hyper-IL-6 and removal of the unbound material, the amount of bound Hyper-IL-6 was determined. Interestingly, mutations in the binding region of site II (muteins I to VI) resulted in reduced binding ability toward Hyper-IL-6 compared with the wild-type sequence. In contrast, all variants involving site III mutations, except for mutation VIII, exhibited similar or even higher binding abilities (muteins VII and IX to XIII) (Fig. 2A). Combination of all seven (site II and site III) mutations from muteins V and XIII in mutein XIV led to reduced binding most likely due to the effect of mutation IV, which was removed from the combination in mutein XV, resulting in a partial rescue of the Hyper-IL-6 binding ability (Fig. 2A). Purification and BAF3/gp130 Cell Assay—To verify these results in a cell-based assay, we purified the proteins by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The biologic activity of the purified muteins was tested on the cellular trans-signaling model cell line BAF3/gp130, which, due to stable transfection with a human gp130 cDNA, proliferates upon stimulation with IL-6/sIL-6R or Hyper-IL-6 (28.Fischer M.

This proliferation can be inhibited by sgp130Fc (15.Jostock T. Müllberg J. Özbek S. Atreya R. Blinn G. Voltz N. Fischer M. Neurath M.F. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, proliferation of Hyper-IL-6-stimulated BAF3/gp130 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by sgp130Fc. Based on their inhibitory potential, the muteins could be divided into three categories. Muteins I to VI, VIII, XIV, and XV exhibited a considerably weaker or no inhibitory activity compared with wild-type sgp130Fc. Mutein VII showed only a slightly enhanced capacity of inhibition, whereas muteins IX to XIII exhibited a significantly higher potency in inhibiting BAF3/gp130 cell proliferation (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the muteins with lower inhibitory potential all contained mutations in the gp130 contact region for site II of IL-6, whereas the muteins with increased inhibitory potential carried mutations within the gp130 contact region for site III. Moreover, the mutations V and VI abolished the inhibitory effect of sgp130Fc completely, but the activity of the corresponding muteins could partially be rescued by introducing beneficial mutations in the site III binding region (mutein XIV and XV, Fig. 2, A and B). It should be noted that mutein VII and IX showed higher binding to the IL-6/sIL-6R complex than the combined mutein XIII, although mutein XIII was most effective in the trans-signaling inhibition assay (Fig. 2B), which might be explained by differential protein stability (see below). After the initial purification by affinity chromatography, we found that about 50% of the material was present as aggregates. These aggregates could be detected by Western blotting even under denaturing and reducing conditions (Fig. 3A). To examine whether these aggregates were also present under native conditions, we performed size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3D). About 50% of the material eluted in the void volume, indicating the presence of aggregated sgp130Fc. An NMR-supported three-dimensional model of the sixth (membrane proximal) domain of gp130 (25.Pachta M. Dissertation. University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany2004Google Scholar) revealed that 11 amino acid residues missing in the original sgp130Fc protein constitute the last β-strand of domain 6 (Fig. 3B). Therefore, in a new construct, we added these 11 amino acid residues to prevent misfolding and subsequent aggregation of this domain. After establishing stably transfected CHO-K"
https://openalex.org/W2091253833,"Appraisal of the scientific impact of researchers, teams and institutions with productivity and citation metrics has major repercussions. Funding and promotion of individuals and survival of teams and institutions depend on publications and citations. In this competitive environment, the number of authors per paper is increasing and apparently some co-authors don't satisfy authorship criteria. Listing of individual contributions is still sporadic and also open to manipulation. Metrics are needed to measure the networking intensity for a single scientist or group of scientists accounting for patterns of co-authorship. Here, I define I1 for a single scientist as the number of authors who appear in at least I1 papers of the specific scientist. For a group of scientists or institution, In is defined as the number of authors who appear in at least In papers that bear the affiliation of the group or institution. I1 depends on the number of papers authored Np. The power exponent R of the relationship between I1 and Np categorizes scientists as solitary (R>2.5), nuclear (R=2.25-2.5), networked (R=2-2.25), extensively networked (R=1.75-2) or collaborators (R<1.75). R may be used to adjust for co-authorship networking the citation impact of a scientist. In similarly provides a simple measure of the effective networking size to adjust the citation impact of groups or institutions. Empirical data are provided for single scientists and institutions for the proposed metrics. Cautious adoption of adjustments for co-authorship and networking in scientific appraisals may offer incentives for more accountable co-authorship behaviour in published articles."
https://openalex.org/W2157857537,"One of the major goals in evolutionary developmental biology is to understand the relationship between gene regulatory networks and the diverse morphologies and their functionalities. Are the diversities solely triggered by random events, or are they inevitable outcomes of an interplay between evolving gene networks and natural selection? Segmentation in arthropod embryogenesis represents a well-known example of body plan diversity. Striped patterns of gene expression that lead to the future body segments appear simultaneously or sequentially in long and short germ-band development, respectively. Moreover, a combination of both is found in intermediate germ-band development. Regulatory genes relevant for stripe formation are evolutionarily conserved among arthropods, therefore the differences in the observed traits are thought to have originated from how the genes are wired. To reveal the basic differences in the network structure, we have numerically evolved hundreds of gene regulatory networks that produce striped patterns of gene expression. By analyzing the topologies of the generated networks, we show that the characteristics of stripe formation in long and short germ-band development are determined by Feed-Forward Loops (FFLs) and negative Feed-Back Loops (FBLs) respectively, and those of intermediate germ-band development are determined by the interconnections between FFL and negative FBL. Network architectures, gene expression patterns and knockout responses exhibited by the artificially evolved networks agree with those reported in the fly Drosophila melanogaster and the beetle Tribolium castaneum. For other arthropod species, principal network architectures that remain largely unknown are predicted. Our results suggest that the emergence of the three modes of body segmentation in arthropods is an inherent property of the evolving networks."
https://openalex.org/W2076143318,"In malaria endemic regions people are commonly infected with multiple species of malaria parasites but the clinical impact of these Plasmodium co-infections is unclear. Differences in transmission seasonality and transmission intensity between endemic regions have been suggested as important factors in determining the effect of multiple species co-infections.In order to investigate the impact of multiple-species infections on clinical measures of malaria we carried out a cross-sectional community survey in Malawi, in 2002. We collected clinical and parasitological data from 2918 participants aged >6 months, and applied a questionnaire to measure malaria morbidity. We examined the effect of transmission seasonality and intensity on fever, history of fever, haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) and parasite density, by comparing three regions: perennial transmission (PT), high intensity seasonal transmission (HIST) and low intensity seasonal transmission (LIST). These regions were defined using multi-level modelling of PCR prevalence data and spatial and geo-climatic measures. The three Plasmodium species (P. falciparum, P. malariae and P. ovale) were randomly distributed amongst all children but not adults in the LIST and PT regions. Mean parasite density in children was lower in the HIST compared with the other two regions. Mixed species infections had lower mean parasite density compared with single species infections in the PT region. Fever rates were similar between transmission regions and were unaffected by mixed species infections. A history of fever was associated with single species infections but only in the HIST region. Reduced mean [Hb] and increased anaemia was associated with perennial transmission compared to seasonal transmission. Children with mixed species infections had higher [Hb] in the HIST region.Our study suggests that the interaction of Plasmodium co-infecting species can have protective effects against some clinical outcomes of malaria but that this is dependent on the seasonality and intensity of malaria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2016476932,"Pak1 (p21-activated kinase-1) and the dynein light chain, LC8, are overexpressed in breast cancer, and their direct interaction has been proposed to regulate tumor cell survival. These effects have been attributed in part to Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of LC8 at serine 88. However, LC8 is homodimeric, which renders Ser(88) inaccessible. Moreover, Pak1 does not contain a canonical LC8 binding sequence compared with other characterized LC8 binding sequences. Together, these observations raise the question whether the Pak1/LC8 interaction is distinct (i.e. enabled by a unique interface independent of LC8 dimerization). Herein, we present results from biochemical, NMR, and crystallographic studies that show that Pak1 (residues 212-222) binds to LC8 along the same groove as canonical LC8 interaction partners (e.g. nNOS and BimL). Using LC8 point mutants K36P and T67A, we were able to differentiate Pak1 from canonical LC8 binding sequences and identify a key hydrogen bond network that compensates for the loss of the conserved glutamine in the consensus sequence. We also show that the target binding interface formed through LC8 dimerization is required to bind to Pak1 and precludes phosphorylation of LC8 at Ser(88). Consistent with this observation, in vitro phosphorylation assays using activated Pak1 fail to phosphorylate LC8. Although these results define structural details of the Pak1/LC8 interaction and suggest a hierarchy of target binding affinities, they do not support the current model whereby Pak1 binds to and subsequently phosphorylates LC8 to promote anchorage-independent growth. Rather, they suggest that LC8 binding modulates Pak1 activity and/or nuclear localization."
https://openalex.org/W2092096928,"Hypoxia/reoxygenation stress induces the activation of specific signaling proteins and activator protein 1 (AP-1) to regulate cell cycle regression and apoptosis. In the present study, we report that hypoxia/reoxygenation stress activates AP-1 by increasing c-Jun phosphorylation and DNA binding activity through activation of Polo-like-kinase 3 (Plk3) resulting in apoptosis. The specific effect of hypoxia/reoxygenation stress on Plk3 activation resulting in c-Jun phosphorylation was the opposite of UV irradiation-induced responses that are meanly independent on activation of the stress-induced JNK signaling pathway in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. The effect of hypoxia/reoxygenation stress-induced Plk3 activation on increased c-Jun phosphorylation and apoptosis was also mimicked by exposure of cells to CoCl2. Hypoxia/reoxygenation activated Plk3 in HCE cells to directly phosphorylate c-Jun proteins at phosphorylation sites Ser-63 and Ser-73, and to increase DNA binding activity of c-Jun, detected by EMSA. Further evidence demonstrated that Plk3 and phospho-c-Jun were immunocolocalized in the nuclear compartment of hypoxia/reoxygenation stress-induced cells. Increased Plk3 activity by overexpression of wild-type and dominantly positive Plk3 enhanced the effect of hypoxia/reoxygenation on c-Jun phosphorylation and cell death. In contrast, knocking-down Plk3 mRNA suppressed hypoxia-induced c-Jun phosphorylation.

Adequate oxygen supply is required for normal tissue function. Vascular deficiency and physical isolation from oxygen sources are the usual causes of oxygen deprivation in tissues (hypoxia). Hypoxic conditions develop in most solid tumors as a result of insufficient blood supply. Cancer cells acquire genetic and adaptive changes allowing them to survive and proliferate in a hypoxic microenvironment. In the cornea, hypoxia leads to pathological conditions in the cornea, such as neovascularization, re-epithelialization attenuation, and apoptosis (1Singh N. Amin S. Richter E. Rashid S.

Hypoxia-induced cellular responses include activation of signaling events and gene expression that control important cellular function affecting cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Cellular responses to hypoxia are complex and dependent upon different levels of oxygen tension (6Hammond E.M. Denko N.C. Dorie M.J. Abraham R.T. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell.

As cells progress through the cell cycle, Plk proteins undergo substantial changes in abundance, kinase activity, or subcellular localization. Plk3 shares one or two stretches of conserved amino acid sequences termed Polo box, and contains similar phospho-serine/threonine-containing motifs for interactions with phosphoserine and phosphothreonine.

Expression of a constitutively active Plk3 results in rapid cell shrinkage, frequently leading to the formation of cells with an elongated, unsevered midbody. Ectopic expression of constitutively active Plk3 induces apparent G2/M arrest followed by apoptosis (32Conn C.W. Hennigan R.F. Dai W. Sanchez Y. Stambrook P.J.

In the present study, we provide interesting and definitive evidence in corneal epithelial cells that hypoxia-induced activation of AP-1 and c-Jun results in apoptosis of these cells through a Plk3-mediated mechanism independent from activation of the JNK signaling pathway, indicating that Plk3 plays a significant role in hypoxia-induced signaling pathways. Culture of Corneal Epithelial Cells—Human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml insulin in an incubator supplied with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was replaced every 2 days, and cells were subcultured by treatment of cells with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. For hypoxia experiments, confluent corneal epithelial cells were placed in an incubator supplemented with 1% O2, 5%CO2, 94% N2 at 37 °C for 4 h. For reoxygenation experiments, culture of the hypoxia-treated cells was continued for another 4 or 16 h under normal culture conditions.

After treatment, the transfected cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis, cell survival assay, or AP-1 activity examination. Transfection of JNK1-specfic siRNA (Qiagen, cat. SI02758637) and Plk3-specific siRNA (Qiagen, cat. SI02223473) were done by adding JNK1- or Plk3-specific siRNA (a final concentration of 25 nm) and 12 μl of HiPerFect (Qiagen, cat. 301705) in 100 μl of culture medium without serum. Transfection complexes in the mixture were formed after 10 min of incubation at 22 °C. The mixture was evenly dropped into cultured cells. Transfected cells were cultured under normal growth conditions for 48–84 h before performing experiments. Control cells were transfected with nonsilencing siRNA using the same method as described above. Cell Survival Index Determined by MTT Assays—A tetrazolium component (MTT) assay was performed following an established protocol in the laboratory (37Li T. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12988-91295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, a colorimetric assay system was used to measure the reduction of MTT to an insoluble formazan product by the mitochondria of viable viable cells. The culture medium was replaced with 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1), and 100 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) were added to each well and incubated for 1 hi n a moisturized CO2 incubator. Acidic isopropyl alcohol (0.4 ml of 0.04 m HCl in absolute isopropyl alcohol) was added to dissolve the colored crystals. All samples were placed into an ELISA plate reader (Beckman DU-600 Spectrophotometer) at a wavelength of 595 nm with background subtraction. The amount of color produced, normalized with the background, is directly proportional to the number of viable cells. Measurement of DNA Fragmentation—HCE cells were washed twice with PBS. Lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml proteinase-K) was added, and cells were then incubated for 4 h at 55 °C. The nuclear lysates were extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol and then extracted with an equal volume of phenolchloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). DNA was precipitated with 0.05 volume of 5 m NaCl and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol, incubated overnight at –20 °C, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The DNA pellet was dried and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) containing 20 μg/ml RNase A and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels, and the results were visualized by staining with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Immunocytochemistry Experiments—For Western analysis, corneal epithelial cells (2 × 105) were lysed in SDS sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% W/V SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, or phenol red. After denaturing, cell lysates were size-fractionated by PAGE. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. They were exposed to blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat milk in TBS-0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied in TBS-T buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Western blots were developed by an ECL Plus System (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized by exposure of x-ray films. For immunostaining, corneal epithelial cells were grown on glass slides and treated as indicated in the figures. The cells were permeated and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in PBS-T overnight. Slides were washed with PBS and incubated with FITC/Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG antibody. For immunoprecipitation, corneal epithelial cells (5 × 107) were rinsed with PBS, followed by incubation in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were spun at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated with antibodies against Plk3 or c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with 50 μl of 10% protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunocomplex beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer, and then, subjected to immunoblot and kinase assay. For Plk3 kinase assays, the experiments were carried out by incubation of the immunocomplex of Plk3 with GST-c-Jun fusion protein in 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, and, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP) for 30 min at room temperature. Equal volumes of samples were displayed on 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by exposure on x-ray film. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear proteins were extracted by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min. The consensus oligonucleotide for AP-1 transcription factor (5′-CGCTTCATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA probes were used to hybridize with extracted nuclear proteins. Reactions were conducted by adding 1 pm γ-32P-labeled DNA probe to each sample. DNA-protein complexes were displayed by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. For the supershift assay, DNA-protein complexes were further incubated with a specific antibody against c-Jun. Specific competition experiments were performed using unlabeled oligonucleotides to compete with the labeled oligonucleotides for AP-1. Nonspecific competition experiments were performed using unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotides to interact with the labeled AP-1 oligonucleotides. Statistical Analysis—For Western analysis, signals in the films were scanned digitally, and the optical densities (OD) were quantified with Image Calculator software. Data were shown as fractions of original values in the MTT assay or relative OD for Western blot experiments as mean ± S.E. Significant differences between the control group and treated groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance and Student's t test at p < 0.05. Hypoxia-induced Activation of Plk3 and c-Jun Phosphorylation—We investigated hypoxic stress-induced signaling events in hypoxia and reoxygenation-exposed HCE cells and found that hypoxic stress including hypoxia and reoxygenation elicited increased Plk3 kinase activities by detection of increased phosphorylation of c-Jun fusion protein in immunocomplex kinase assays (Fig. 1A). The specific effect of hypoxia-induced Plk3 activation on c-Jun phosphorylation was further determined by two-step immunocomplex kinase assays. In step 1, JNK-1 protein in cell lysates was removed by immunoprecipitation, and then Plk3 was further immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts in that JNK-1 protein had been depleted. The precipitated Plk3 from the extracts was used in immunocomplex kinase assays to determine the effect of hypoxia-induced Plk3 activation on phosphorylation of c-Jun fusion proteins (Fig. 1B). Results indicate that hypoxic stress activated Plk3, resulting in c-Jun protein phosphorylation in the absence of JNK activity. We also found that there were increased phosphorylation levels of the endogenous c-Jun in HCE cells exposed to hypoxia, reoxygenation, and UV irradiation (Fig. 1C). Increased phosphorylation levels of endogenous c-Jun proteins in response to hypoxic stress were mimicked by treating cells with various concentrations of CoCl2 (Fig. 1D). Hypoxic stress-induced site-specific phosphorylation of c-Jun was detected using Ser-63 and Ser-73 site-specific and antiphosphorylated c-Jun antibodies following a time course from 30 min to 4 h (Fig. 1E). We observed increased phosphorylation of c-Jun protein in both sites, while there was no change in the expression level of Plk3 during a 4-h hypoxic treatment period. The potential role of c-Jun in hypoxic stress-induced cells was further verified by detection of c-Jun activity in AP-1 complex in cell nuclei. In hypoxia- and reoxygenation-treated cells, there were increased AP-1 binding activities and supershift bands found in lanes treated with the c-Jun-specific antibody in EMSA (Fig. 1F). Control experiments were done by competing AP-1 binding with unlabeled AP-1 nucleotides and nonspecific SP-1 nucleotides and by exposure of HCE cells to UV irradiation. In addition, non-specific antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p53 were used in supershift experiments as the control. Previously, we reported that activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) results in phosphorylation of c-Jun protein and cellular apoptotic responses in HCE cells (38Wang L. Xu D. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3678-3685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Lu L. Wang L. Shell B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 5102-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, we found that hypoxic stress-induced Plk3 activation phosphorylated c-Jun, suggesting that hypoxic stress may activate c-Jun through multiple pathways, such as both the Plk3 and JNK signaling pathways. We then investigated whether hypoxic stress also induced c-Jun activation through the JNK signaling pathway in corneal epithelial cells. JNK activity was determined by measuring the phosphorylation levels of JNK using the phospho-JNK specific antibody in hypoxia and reoxygenation-induced HCE cells (Fig. 2A). In a parallel control experiment, UV irradiation induced marked activation of JNK. However, there was minor activation of JNK represented by much weaker bands in hypoxic stress-induced cells. The effect of hypoxic stress on JNK activity was further verified by measuring hypoxic stress-induced activation of SEK1, an immediate upstream kinase of JNK in the kinase cascades. We found that there was a detectible and minor SEK1 phosphorylation in hypoxia/reoxygenation-exposed HCE cells (Fig. 2B). In previous studies, we demonstrate that in addition to the JNK pathway, UV irradiation can activate other MAP kinase pathways including ERK and p38 cascades. We found that Erk phosphorylation was not changed by hypoxic treatment, but the phosphorylation level was markedly increased in cells treated with hypoxia followed by reoxygenation (Fig. 2C). However, there were no significant changes in p38 activity in hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced HCE cells (Fig. 2D). These results provide supportive evidence suggesting that a novel signaling pathway, other than the JNK signaling pathway, is involved in hypoxic stress-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation in HCE cells.FIGURE 2Hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced activation of MAP kinases.

UV irradiation-induced MAP kinase activation served as positive controls.

To verify the interaction between Plk3 and c-Jun in the hypoxia-induced pathway, we examined the potential co-localization of Plk3 and c-Jun in subcellular compartments. Immunostaining experiments were performed to map the protein locations of Plk3 and c-Jun in hypoxia-induced HCE cells. Data obtained from double immunostaining and immunofluorescent microscopy showed that there were significant changes in immunoactivities by forming dense regions that were co-localized in the nuclear region of hypoxia-induced cells. In contrast, Plk3 was observed mainly in the surrounding region of nuclei without overlapped immunoactivities with c-Jun in control cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, hypoxia-induced Plk3 and c-Jun activities were co-localized in cell nuclei, indicated by DAPI staining and double immunostaining (Fig. 3B). The results of immunostaining experiments indicate hypoxic stress-induced changes of Plk3 in subcellular compartments and suggest interactions between Plk3 and c-Jun in cell nuclei. Activation of AP-1 by Hypoxia-induced Plk3 Activation—Although Plk3 and c-Jun were co-localized in hypoxia-induced cell nuclei, it is important to know whether Plk3 is functionally associated with c-Jun activation in response to hypoxic stress. We transfected HCE cells with wild-type Plk3 (Plk3wild) using lipofection and found that overexpression of Plk3 effectively increased the level of hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). However, transfection of HCE cells with a kinase-defective Plk3 mutant (Plk3K52R) and the control vector did not affect hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced c-Jun phosphorylation in HCE cells. Next, the affect of hypoxia/reoxygenation on c-Jun activity was studied in HCE cells transfected with constitutively active Plk3-PBD and defective Plk3-WV, respectively. 20-h post-transfection, cells were first analyzed for expression of GFP-tagged Plk3 mutants, and then the changes of c-Jun phosphorylation in transfected cells were determined by Western analysis using an antibody against phosphorylated c-Jun (Fig. 4B). It appeared that there was a much higher level of hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced c-Jun phosphorylation in HCE cells transfected with constitutively active Plk3-PBD than those defective Plk3-WV-transfected cells. Further downstream, hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity in EMSA was markedly increased in Plk3-PBD transfected HCE cells compared with those cells transfected with Plk3-WV (Fig. 4C). In addition, hypoxic stress induced a much lower phosphorylation level of c-Jun at both Ser-63 and Ser-73 sites in cells where Plk3 mRNA was knocked-down by transfecting the cell with Plk3-specific siRNA (Fig. 4D). These results strongly support the initial observation that hypoxic stress-induced Plk3 activation results in increases in c-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation. Mediation of Hypoxic Stress-induced Apoptosis by Plk3—We demonstrated that Plk3 was rapidly activated in response to hypoxic stress, resulting in c-Jun/AP-1 activation. Previously, we have shown that activation of c-Jun/AP-1 by UV irradiation is associated with apoptosis in HCE cells. To investigate the effect of hypoxic stress on apoptosis, HCE cells were induced by hypoxia in the presence of 1% O2 in cultures. There was significantly increased apoptosis in hypoxia-induced cells, determined by measuring DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activation, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). The effect of Plk3 activity on apoptosis was observed in HCE cells transfected with the constitutively active Plk3-PBD and defective Plk3-WV. There were significantly increased caspase 3 activities observed in cells overexpressing constitutively active Plk3, suggesting that Plk3 activity is associated in triggering apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 5C). To further verify the effect of hypoxic stress-induced Plk3 activation on cell death, cell viabilities were also determined by MTT assays (Fig. 6). Survival cell index of hypoxia-induced cells were significantly suppressed within 1 h and continuously decreased to a very low level in 2 h (Fig. 6A). In the other group experiments, CoCl2 (250–500 μm) was applied to HCE cells to mimic hypoxic stress. Consistent with the observation in hypoxia-induced cells, CoCl2 treatment induced decreases in survival cell index to very low levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). To investigate the effect of Plk3 on cell viability, HCE cells were transfected with the wild-type Plk3 (Plk3wild) and kinase-defective Plk3 mutant (Plk3K52R). Overexpression of Plk3wild induced a significant decrease in survival cell index (Fig. 6C). However, transfection of cells with Plk3K52R had no affect on the cell viability compared with control cells. The effect of Plk3 activity on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced decreases in cell viability was studied in cells transfected with the constitutively active Plk3 (pEGFP-Plk3-PBD) and defective Plk3 (pEGFP-Plk3-WV). Survival cell index was significantly decreased in constitutively active Plk3-transfected HCE cells compared with control (normoxia) cells that were transfected with defective Plk3 mutants and the vector (Fig. 6D). These results indicate that Plk3 activation by hypoxia/reoxygenation plays an important role in hypoxic stress-induced apoptotic responses in HCE cells.FIGURE 6Effect of Plk3 on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced changes in survival cell index detected by MTT assay.

Activity of c-Jun is upregulated by growth factors, cytokines, and UV irradiation (35Wang L. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32121-32127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 40Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin.

Cell Prolif. 2007; 40: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has been known that c-Jun is the downstream target protein and substrate of JNK in response to cytokine and environmental stress stimulation. We found that both SEK-1 and JNK are slightly activated by hypoxia/reoxygenation, while c-Jun is strongly phosphorylated by hypoxia/reoxygenation in HCE cells (Fig. 2, A and B). This is opposite to UV irradiation-induced cells in that both JNK and c-Jun were highly phosphorylated, suggesting that there should be other protein kinases involving hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun. In HCE cells, Western analysis using the anti-phospho-p38 antibody demonstrated that there is no p38 activation after exposing the cells to hypoxia/reoxygenation, suggesting that the p38 signaling pathway may not play a main role in hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced AP1 activation. However, it seems that the Erk signaling pathway is involved in the reoxygenation-induced response, because the phosphorylation level of Erk is increased only in the reoxygenation process (Fig. 2C). Our data in measuring MAP kinase pathways in hypoxic stress-induced HCE cells provide additional information to support the initial hypothesis that there may be another signaling mechanism involving hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun in these cells. Plk3 is a multifunctional protein kinase that is activated in response to various environment stresses (27Dai W. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The effect of hypoxia/reoxygenation on Plk3 activation has not been previously reported in the published literature. In this study, our results revealed, for the first time, that Plk3 is activated by hypoxia/reoxygenation, and that active Plk3 phosphorylates c-Jun protein, resulting in a decreasing survival cell index and increasing cell apoptosis. We previously reported that, in addition to JNK activation, Plk3 was in parallel activated by UV irradiation stress, resulting in c-Jun phosphorylation (35Wang L. Dai W. Lu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32121-32127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this case, it is very likely that Plk3 also plays a role in hypoxic stress-induced c-Jun phosphorylation. The results of this study demonstrate that Plk3 is indeed activated by hypoxia/reoxygenation, and active Plk3 directly phosphorylates c-Jun protein as its substrate. Further evidence indicates that hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced c-Jun phosphorylation is significantly enhanced by overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active Plk3 in HCE cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, knocking-down Plk3 mRNA to suppress Plk3 expression had a profound effect on Jun phosphorylation at both Ser-63 and Ser-73 residues, suggesting that there may be other mechanisms involved in the hypoxia-induced signaling. Details about this requires further investigation. As expected, AP1 activity is also greatly increased by overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active Plk3. These results indicate that Plk3 plays a major role in hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced c-Jun activation. The question remaining to be answered in our future research is how hypoxia/reoxygenation activates Plk3. It has been shown that ATM/ATR is activated by hypoxia and reoxygenation. In response to DNA damage, activated ATM/ATR induced Chk1 and Chk2 activation, which then activated Plk3. We found Chk1 and Chk2 were phosphorylated by hypoxia stress (data not shown). It is very possible that hypoxia and reoxygenation activate ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2, thus leading to Plk3 activation. There is no doubt that our findings in the present study provide important evidence establishing that hypoxia/reoxygenation-activated Plk3 plays a critical role in mediating c-Jun activation. On the other hand, transfection of Plk3-PBD, but not its mutants, causes significant activation of c-Jun, which correlates with enhanced capspase-3 activity. Given that PBD is known to function as a motif interacting with serine/threonine-phosphorylated residues (43Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 83-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), it is also possible that Plk3-PBD specifically recognizes and interacts with phosphorylated/activated c-Jun. We observed that Hif1 expression increased with hypoxia treatment (data not show), indicating that the hypoxia condition is successful or proven. Whether Hif1 affects Plk3-mediated c-Jun activation was not researched in this study; however, the time course of c-Jun phosphorylation was shown to be consistent with the time course of Hif1 activation from 0.5 to 4 h under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1D). It seems that posttranslational regulation is dominant in c-Jun activation. The correlation between hypoxic stress-induced Plk3 and c-Jun activation is evidenced by direct phosphorylation of c-Jun protein by active Plk3 and using immunostaining to co-localize active Plk3 and c-Jun in the nuclei of HCE cells after hypoxic stimulation (Fig. 3). Finally, interaction between Plk3 and c-Jun in response to hypoxic stress stimulation has functional meaning because: 1) increased Plk3 activity parallels increased c-Jun phosphorylation in response to hypoxic stress; 2) hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis is affected by excessive Plk3 activity in exogenous Plk3-transfected cells; and 3) the effect of hypoxic stress-induced Plk3 activation on apoptosis is enhanced by transfecting cells with wild type and constitutively active Plk3. Hypoxia and reoxygenation cause major damage to human organs and various cells types, including cancer cells. In fact, hypoxia can be found in many disease stages and is considered to be one of the stress stimuli that induces cellular responses directly related to cellular function and apoptosis. Thus, to study the effect of hypoxic stress on cellular signaling pathways is of clinical importance."

The monomeric subunit exhibits a five-domain structure that is widely conserved from bacteria to plants and mammals (12Leszczyniecka M. DeSalle R. Kang D.C. Fisher P.B. Mol. Phylogenet.

Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The structural core of the subunit appears to be a duplication of an RNase PH domain, with the two RNase PH-like domains connected by a poorly conserved linker domain. In the doughnut-shaped homotrimeric protein, the subunits form a central channel where catalysis is thought to occur; the KH and S1 RNA-binding domains are located on top of the enzyme, with the former immediately above the central channel and the latter facing outward away from the channel (14Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Struct. Folding Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (223) Google Scholar). PNPase was originally implicated in the synthesis of cellular RNA before the template-dependent RNA polymerase was discovered (2Grunberg-Manago M. Ortiz P.J. Ochoa S.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has long been assumed that, because of the high Pi intracellular concentration, PNPase would act in vivo mainly phosphorolytically (17Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). More recently, however, it was shown that PNPase can add heteropolymeric tails to RNA 3′-ends (18Mohanty B.K. Kushner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11966-11971Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Slomovic S. Portnoy V. Liveanu V. Schuster G. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 2008; 25: 65-77Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because in Escherichia coli PNPase-dependent heteropolymeric failing, like polyadenylation by polyadenyl polymerase (PAP), targets bacterial RNAs to degradation (20Mohanty B.K. Kushner S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5695-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), both PNPase phosphorolytic and polymerization activities participate in PNPase-dependent RNA decay. Finally, it was suggested that PNPase plays a central role in the biosynthetic pathway of dCTP by providing the CDP precursor (21Danchin A. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), thus linking RNA turnover to DNA replication. Although widely conserved in Bacteria and Eukarya, the pnp gene does not seem to be essential for survival. In some bacteria such as E. coli and Yersinia enterocolitica, however, it is essential for bacterial growth in the cold (22Luttinger A. Hahn J. Dubnau D. Mol.

PNPase seems also to be directly or indirectly involved in the control of several processes such as cold shock response (25Gualerzi C.O. Giuliodori A.M. Pon C.L. J. Mol.

Plant Sci. 2008; 25: 65-77Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Lin-Chao S. Chiou N.T. Schuster G. J. Biomed. Sci. 2007; 14: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the last few years, human PNPase, which localizes in the mitochondrial inner membrane space and possibly in the cytoplasm, has been implicated in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and cell differentiation and in cellular senescence (29Chen H.W. Koehler C.M. Teitell M.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 600-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In E. coli, PNPase has been localized both in the cytoplasm and associated with the cell membrane and ribosomes (30Kimhi Y. Littauer U.Z. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2066-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 31Liou G.-G. Jane W.-N. Cohen S.N. Lin N.-S. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, PNPase may exist as a single homotrimeric enzyme, associated with the RNA helicase RhlB (32Lin P.H. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16590-16595Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and in a multiprotein machine, the RNA degradosome, together with the endoribonuclease RNase E, which also serves as a scaffold for the assembly of the complex, RhlB, and enolase. In such heteromultimeric associations, PNPase can degrade otherwise refractory double-stranded RNA regions in an ATP-dependent manner (32Lin P.H. Lin-Chao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Microbiol. 1994; 14: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), a property that has been used as a degradosome functional assay (37Mackie G.A. Coburn G.A. Miao X. Briant D.J. Prud'homme-Genereux A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In experiments aimed at assessing the functionality of RNA degradosomes from pnp mutants isolated in our laboratory (38Briani F. Del Favero M. Capizzuto R. Consonni C. Zangrossi S. Greco C. De Gioia L. Tortora P. Dehò G. Biochimie (Paris). 2007; 89: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we realized that ATP concentrations higher than 5 mm retarded the appearance of the cleavage products and, in control reactions with purified PNPase, inhibited RNA degradation. Here, we report that ATP binds to PNPase and inhibits both its phosphorolytic and polymerization activities. Such a direct control by ATP highlights an unforeseen metabolic role of PNPase that connects RNA turnover and the energy charge of the cell. PNPase Kinetic Assays—PNPase was purified as described (39Matus-Ortega M.E. Regonesi M.E. Pina-Escobedo A. Tortora P. Dehò G. Garcia-Mena J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1769: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The phosphorolytic activity of purified PNPase using poly(A) as a substrate was measured in a coupled pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay as described (40Fontanella L. Pozzuolo S. Costanzo A. Favaro R. Dehò G. Tortora P. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) at the indicated MgCl2 concentrations. The assay, which measures the ADP produced as NADH oxidation, was performed in a 1-ml reaction mixture at 28 °C, and absorbance was continuously recorded at 340 nm. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 μmol of ADP/min under the working conditions. PNPase polymerization activity was detected by measuring the Pi released during the polymerization reaction as described (41Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Invitrogen). Assays were performed at 25 °C in a 1-ml volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm ADP, 20 μg/ml poly(A), and MgCl2 at the indicated concentrations. Degradation and 3′-Tailing of PNPL1 RNA—For degradation and polymerization assays with a specific RNA substrate, 32P-labeled PNPL1 (pnp leader) RNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP using a DNA template obtained by PCR amplification of plasmid pAZ101 (11Regonesi M.E. Briani F. Ghetta A. Zangrossi S. Ghisotti D. Tortora P. Dehò G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1006-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with oligonucleotides FG676 (5′-ctaatacgactcactatagggATGAATGATCTTCCGTTGC, where lowercase letters indicate the T7 promoter, and uppercase letters indicate E. coli) and FG1387 (5′-AATGTAATATCCTTTCTCTTTCTTAG). PNPL1 RNA encompasses the first 158 nucleotides of the non-processed pnp transcript from the pnp-p promoter. Phosphorolysis was performed at 26 °C in 30-μl reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, 4.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 10 mm KCl) containing 0.2 μm PNPL1 (35,000 cpm), 8.6 nm PNPase, and 10 mm Pi. Polymerization was performed under the same conditions with 1 mm ADP and omitting Pi. Reactions were stopped by adding 3-μl samples to 5 μl of stop solution (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol) and heating for 5 min at 95 °C. The samples were analyzed by denaturing 6% acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the autoradiographic image was acquired by phosphorimaging the exsiccated gel. Photoaffinity Labeling—Photocross-linking assay was performed by UV irradiating (2 J cm–2, 254 nm) 2 pmol of purified proteins preincubated for 10 min at 21 °C with 3.3 pmol of either [α-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]ATP in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.4 mm dithiothreitol in a UV Stratalinker 2400 apparatus (Stratagene). 10 mm MgCl2 and 33 μm ADP were also present where indicated. Before UV irradiation, the samples were transferred in a 96-well microtiter plate on ice. The UV-irradiated samples were then run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and visualized by phosphorimaging. ATP Inhibits Both PNPase Enzyme Activities—While performing functional assays with RNA degradosomes assembled with mutant PNPases isolated in our laboratory (38Briani F. Del Favero M. Capizzuto R. Consonni C. Zangrossi S. Greco C. De Gioia L. Tortora P. Dehò G. Biochimie (Paris). 2007; 89: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we observed that ATP concentrations higher than 5 mm retarded the appearance of degradation products (data not shown). To discriminate whether ATP directly inhibits the catalytic activity of PNPase rather than other properties of the entire degradosome, we tested the effect of ATP on purified PNPase by monitoring the shortening and elongation of a specific RNA (PNPL1) substrate in the presence of Pi and ADP, respectively. PNPL1 is predicted to form a long stable stem-loop at the 5′-end, followed by a less structured 3′-tail (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, incubation of 32P-labeled PNPL1 with PNPase in the presence of Pi led to the accumulation of an ∼100-nucleotide-long degradation product, whereas the same substrate in the presence of ADP was elongated up to ∼1 kb after a 30-min incubation. Both phosphorolysis and polymerization were, however, completely inhibited by 10 mm ATP. To rule out that Pi and ADP, which are spontaneous ATP hydrolysis products, could be responsible for these inhibitory effects by driving in the opposite direction the reversible reactions, we performed the PNPase assays in 1 mm ADP and varying Pi concentrations. As shown in Fig. 1C, Pi up to 0.3 mm did not reverse the polymerization reaction with 1 mm ADP, whereas 1 mm ADP did not reverse degradation with 10 mm Pi. Thus, contamination of Pi and ADP up to 3 and 10%, respectively, of the ATP concentration used in the previous experiment would be not be influential on the PNPase reactions under our assay conditions. By varying the ATP concentration, we observed that, under our assay conditions, 4 mm ATP substantially inhibited both phosphorolytic and polymerizing activities (Fig. 1D). PNPase Binds ATP—To test whether PNPase can directly bind ATP, we performed affinity labeling experiments by UV cross-linking radiolabeled ATP to PNPase. As shown in Fig. 2A, both [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (0.33 μm) were cross-linked to PNPase. This indicates that ATP, rather than its spontaneous hydrolysis product ADP, AMP, or Pi, was cross-linked to PNPase. No cross-linking could be detected with carboxypeptidase used as a control, whereas a weak signal (barely visible in the original scan) in the absence of MgCl2 was detectable with ribosomal protein S1. 10 mm MgCl2 reduced but did not abolish cross-linking. Affinity labeling was not competed by 33 μm ADP. Interestingly, however, cross-linking was essentially not competed by unlabeled ATP up to ∼100 μm (Fig. 2, B and C), thus suggesting that 0.33 μm ATP was far from saturation, in keeping with the I0.5 values determined for the nucleotide (see below). ATP Allosterically Inhibits PNPase—To perform kinetic analysis of PNPase phosphorolytic activity at different ATP concentrations, we used poly(A) as a substrate and measured the appearance of ADP in a coupled pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay at constant saturating poly(A) (30 μg/ml) and at varying Pi concentrations. The results (Fig. 3A) were consistent with a mixed-type inhibition (42Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar), with a scanty increase in Km and a substantial decrease in Vmax upon increasing ATP concentrations. Thus, the pattern observed is close to pure noncompetitive inhibition. In particular, Vmax dropped from ∼0.7 to 0.2 units/mg when ATP was raised from 0 to 5 mm. Similar results were obtained at fixed Pi and varying poly(A) concentrations. However, at poly(A) concentrations close to or lower than the Km (∼2 μg/ml), measurements were subject to large dispersions, which prevented us from accurately determining the kinetic parameters (data not shown). In any case, the activity was completely abolished even at 30 μg/ml poly(A) (data not shown), thus ruling out competitive inhibition. We therefore conclude that the ATP-binding site is distinct from that of both substrates. According to the kinetic model, replots of slopes and 1/v axis intercepts as a function of inhibitor concentration should yield straight lines with intercepts on the abscissa that equal the inhibition constant (42Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). However, following this procedure, we surprisingly observed large and systematic deviations from linearity of the experimental points. We thus conclude that PNPase does not conform to a classical mixed-type or noncompetitive inhibition model. Moreover, when plotting the percentage of PNPase inhibition versus ATP concentration at saturating substrates, a sigmoidal curve was obtained (Fig. 3B), which clearly points to cooperative allosteric binding of the nucleotide. Based on the best fitting curve, a Hill coefficient of 2.3 and an I0.5 (i.e. a concentration that gives 50% inhibition) of 3.3 mm were estimated. The experiments were performed at 5 and 13 mm MgCl2, and the results obtained under either condition were superimposable (Fig. 3B). This rules out the hypothesis that the inhibition observed depends simply on depletion of Mg2+ (an ion required for PNPase activity) complexed with ATP. A similar profile was obtained with purified FLAG-Rne degradosome (43Regonesi M.E. Del Favero M. Basilico F. Briani F. Benazzi L. Tortora P. Mauri P. Dehò G. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) rather than trimeric PNPase (data not shown). We also checked the effect of other nucleoside triphosphates on PNPase activity. Our results (Table 1) show that the purine nucleotides GTP, dGTP, dATP, and non-hydrolyzable ATP were also inhibitory, whereas the pyrimidine nucleotides CTP and UTP did not exert any appreciable effect.TABLE 1Inhibitory effect of different nucleoside triphosphates on PNPase phosphorolytic activityATPdATPβ,γ-Imido-ATPGTPdGTPCTPUTPResidual activity (%)aThe activity (average of at least three independent measurements) is expressed as a percentage of the control assays without nucleotide added.303950654010298a The activity (average of at least three independent measurements) is expressed as a percentage of the control assays without nucleotide added. Open table in a new tab To detect the effect of ATP in the synthetic direction, we measured the released Pi using a commercially available enzymatic assay for phosphate detection that allows continuous measurements of PNPase activity. The data shown in Fig. 3C indicate that ATP also inhibits polymerization at both 5 and 13 mm with I0.5 values of ∼5 mm. Here, we present clear-cut evidence, using both a model RNA and poly(A) as substrates, that E. coli PNPase binds to and is inhibited by ATP. Although this effect is likely to play a major regulatory role, no such observation was reported to date despite over 5 decades of investigations on this enzyme. Our results show that the ATP-binding site is distinct from that of the substrates, as none of them could abolish or reduce the inhibitory effect even at saturating concentrations. In particular, our kinetic analysis demonstrates a mixed-type inhibition of ATP toward Pi. Furthermore, replots of slopes and 1/v axis intercepts as a function of inhibitor concentration did not yield straight lines as predicted by the classical mixed-type inhibition model (42Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). In contrast, the sigmoidal profile of PNPase inhibition as a function of ATP concentration indicates a cooperative allosteric binding of the nucleotide. In particular, we assessed a Hill coefficient of 2.3, well in agreement with the trimeric structure of the enzyme, and an I0.5 of 3.3 mm. Similar results were obtained at a poly(A) concentration close to the Km, i.e. 2 μg/ml, and also using the whole degradosome instead of PNPase alone (data not shown). This latter observation implies that ATP may also modulate PNPase function at the level of the multiprotein complex. The nucleotide also exerted a comparable inhibition on the synthetic activity, with a Hill coefficient of 2.3 as in the phosphorolytic direction and an I0.5 of 5.0 mm. Our kinetic assays may not fully reproduce the physiological conditions, as ADP and Pi are promptly removed by the auxiliary reactions in the phosphorolytic and synthetic tests, respectively. This should, however, not affect the mode of ATP inhibition because the ATP-binding site is distinct from that of the substrates. Taken together, these results strongly support the idea that the inhibition exerted by ATP on PNPase is a phenomenon of physiological relevance. In particular, enzymes displaying a sigmoidal dependence of their activity on metabolite concentrations are believed to exert major roles in metabolic regulation. However, the interpretation of our observations is not straightforward. Classical studies conducted by Atkinson (44Atkinson D.E. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 4030-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar, 45Shen L.C. Atkinson D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5974-5978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) several decades ago established that high values of energy charge, and thus high ATP and low ADP and AMP, inhibit the catabolic pathways in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Unfortunately, accurate assessment of the enzyme behavior under physiological conditions is not feasible, as the local intracellular concentration of Pi and nucleotides can hardly be predicted. Nevertheless, our finding may help shed light on the physiological significance of different RNA degradation pathways operating in E. coli. It has been pointed out that the phosphorolytic degradation of mRNA by PNPase, which operates close to equilibrium, is more energy saving than the hydrolysis performed by RNase II, which releases nucleoside monophosphates and is far from equilibrium (46Deutscher M.P. Reuven N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3277-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, 3′-end tailing of RNA may be performed both by PAP at the expense of ATP and by PNPase, which uses NDPs. Thus, PNPase-dependent degradation of RNA would be energetically more favorable than RNase II/PAP-dependent degradation and would be activated at a low energy charge. Additional regulatory levels might occur in the RNA degradosome and in the PNPase-RhlB complex, where the RNA helicase unwinds RNA secondary structures and hydrolyzes ATP (35Carpousis A.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 61: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). This could lower the local ATP concentration with concurrent PNPase activation. Conversely, a low helicase activity may allow a local increase of ATP concentration, thus inhibiting RNA degradation. Predictions of the above speculations are that RNase II, the PNPase-RhlB complex, and the RNA degradosome may perform RNA degradation at high energy charge, whereas free PNPase activity would be more relevant at low ATP concentrations. Although information on RNA decay mechanisms at different energy charge is scanty, an interesting observation that supports our model has been obtained by Andrade et al. (47Andrade J.M. Cairrao F. Arraiano C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These authors found that PNPase strongly contributes to the decay rate of the ompA transcript in stationary phase, whereas RNase II seems to minimally affect the half-life of this mRNA. A systematic study of the role of different phosphorolytic and hydrolytic exoribonucleases in the mRNA decay at different energy charge will aid in understanding the physiological role of PNPase inhibition by ATP. The above interpretation does not rule out other possible scenarios that implicate PNPase in metabolic processes other than the mere RNA decay. For instance, the release of ADP and other NDPs at low energy charge with concomitant formation of high energy phosphoanhydride bonds might be a mechanism that exploits RNA degradation to reconstitute ATP via adenylate kinase. Finally, as PNPase may have a role in providing the dCTP precursor CDP (21Danchin A. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), inhibition by ATP might play a role in coordinating DNA replication, RNA degradation, and cell energy charge. Whatever their interpretation may be, our findings imply that a reconsideration of the precise physiological role(s) of this enzyme is required. The accurate determination of the intracellular concentrations of the chemical species affecting PNPase activity (NTPs, NDPs, and Pi) and the prevalence of alternative RNA degradation pathways under different physiological conditions such as metabolic stress and cold shock might provide clues to understanding the role of the ATP inhibitory effect reported here. Moreover, it will be interesting to assess whether this property is shared by other PNPases and whether it controls the pleiotropic effects associated with this enzyme in bacteria, plants, and humans."

ArgDC activity has evolved through convergent evolution at least five times, demonstrating the utility of this enzyme and the plasticity of amino acid decarboxylases. The Crenarchaeota include the most hyperthermophilic cultivated microorganisms. To help stabilize macromolecules in these extreme conditions, some hyperthermophiles produce unusually long chain or branched polyamines (1Terui Y. Ohnuma M. Hiraga K. Kawashima E. Oshima T. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Chromatographic analyses of extracts from the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus identified significant amounts of the linear polyamines 1,3-diaminopropane, putrescine, sym-norspermidine (caldine), spermidine, and sym-norspermine (thermine), with traces of spermine (2De Rosa M.

De Rosa S. Gambacorta A. Cartenì-Farina M. Zappia V. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the AdoMet decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) (5Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Bertoldo C. Zappia V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and propylamine transferase (6Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Cartenì-Farina M. Gambacorta A. Zappia V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 161: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) enzymes were purified from S. solfataricus. The latter enzyme produces spermidine and spermine from putrescine and dcAdoMet, and it produces norspermidine and norspermine from 1,3-diaminopropane and dcAdoMet (Fig. 1).The complete genome sequences of 13 thermophilic crenarchaea encode orthologs of propylamine transferase (7Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. Moretti M.A. Sorrentino F. Concilio L. Zappia V. Liu Z.-J. Tempel W. Schubot F. Rose J.P. Wang B.-C. Brereton P.S. Jenney F.E. Adams M.W.W. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6057-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and two homologs of the archaeal type AdoMetDC (supplemental Table 1) (8Kim A.D. Graham D.E. Seeholzer S.H. Markham G.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, none of the genomes encodes a recognizable ornithine decarboxylase enzyme to produce putrescine. Instead they have homologs of the agmatine ureohydrolase enzyme (9Goda S. Sakuraba H. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohshima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1748: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that putrescine is derived from l-arginine as in the Euryarchaeota. Some bacteria produce agmatine from arginine using a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent arginine decarboxylase (ArgDC) (10Wu W.H. Morris D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1687-1695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, euryarchaea use a pyruvoyl-dependent ArgDC that is related to Lactobacillus sp. histidine decarboxylase (11Graham D.E. Xu H. White R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23500-23507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). No crenarchaea have homologs of the PLP-dependent enzyme, and only three have homologs of the euryarchaeal enzyme. Therefore, we predicted that members of the Crenarchaeota have a new type of arginine decarboxylase that is evolutionarily unrelated to the previously characterized enzymes.The two AdoMetDC proteins from S. solfataricus, SSO0536 and SSO0585, share 47% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 2). mRNAs from the respective genes were previously shown to have different half-lives (7 min for SSO0536 and 17–20 min for SSO0585) (12Andersson A. Lundgren M. Eriksson S. Rosenlund M. Bernander R. Nilsson P. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R99Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The same discrepancy was observed in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and the two genes could have different functions. Both AdoMetDC homologs from S. solfataricus were cloned in Escherichia coli, and the polyhistidine-tagged proenzymes were heterologously expressed and purified. These proteins self-cleaved at a conserved serine residue, forming aminoterminal β-subunits and active pyruvoyl groups on their carboxyl-terminal α-subunits. The His10-SSO0585 protein catalyzed the decarboxylation of AdoMet in a coupled assay with AdoMet synthetase enzyme, and it is probably the same protein that was previously purified (but not sequenced) by Cacciapuoti et al. (5Cacciapuoti G. Porcelli M. De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Bertoldo C. Zappia V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The His10-SSO0536 protein also self-cleaved, but it did not catalyze AdoMet decarboxylation. Instead, it efficiently catalyzed the decarboxylation of l-arginine. Therefore, this crenarchaeal protein represents a new class of arginine decarboxylases that developed through convergent evolution. A chimeric protein containing the β-subunit of SSO0536 and the α-subunit of SSO0585 functioned specifically as an ArgDC, correlating conserved changes in the amino-terminal part of this protein with the change in substrate specificity. The SSO0536 protein is the first member of the AdoMet decarboxylase family shown to catalyze another reaction. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that an ancestral AdoMetDC gene duplicated once in the crenarchaeal lineage. Subtle changes to the active site structure of one paralog enabled the evolution of this new arginine decarboxylase activity and displaced an ancestral euryarchaeal ArgDC.FIGURE 2Protein sequence alignment of the S. solfataricus ArgDC protein (SSO0536) with a putative ArgDC from Aeropyrum pernix (APE0079; NP_146956.1), AdoMetDC from S. solfataricus (SSO0585), AdoMetDC from Bacillus subtilis (BsAdoMetDC; NP_390779.1), AdoMetDC from M. jannaschii (MjAdoMetDC; NP_247288.1), and AdoMetDC from T. maritima (TmAdoMetDC; NP_228464.1). The secondary structure of TmAdoMetDC is indicated as β-strands and α-helices below the alignment (from PDB 1VR7) (29Toms A.V. Kinsland C. McCloskey D.E. Pegg A.E. Ealick S.E. J. Biol.

(13Bey P. Vevert J.-P. Van Dorsselaer V. Kolb M. J. Org. Chem. 1979; 44: 2732-2742Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). DFMO hydrochloride (1.0 g, 4.2 mmol) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of 2 m sodium hydroxide. S-Methylisothiourea hemisulfate (1.18 g, 8.5 mmol) was added with stirring at room temperature. The pH was adjusted to 10.5 with sodium hydroxide, and the solution was stirred for 5 days. The solution was adjusted to pH 7 with HCl and evaporated to dryness under vacuum at 60 °C. The residue was dissolved in 7 ml of water and applied to a Dowex 50 (H+) column (1 × 31 cm). The column was subsequently washed with 4 bed volumes of water and 2 volumes of 1 m ammonium hydroxide. DFMA was eluted with 2 m ammonium hydroxide. Ninhydrin-positive fractions were combined and evaporated to dryness under vacuum to produce 0.63 g of DFMA (2.8 mmol, 67%). Crystallization of the hydrochloride salt afforded hygroscopic white crystals. The 1H NMR and 39F NMR spectra were consistent with previous data (13Bey P. Vevert J.-P. Van Dorsselaer V. Kolb M. J. Org. Chem. 1979; 44: 2732-2742Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). High resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) confirmed the chemical composition of the MH+ ion: expected 225.11576 m/z, observed 225.1160 m/z. DFMO was a gift from Dr. Patrick Woster (Wayne State University) and was originally produced by Dow Chemicals. All other chemicals were purchased from various distributors in reagent grade and used without further purification.Strains and Growth Media—S. solfataricus P2 (DSM 1617) was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen. Cultures were grown in complex DSMZ medium 182 containing yeast extract (2 g), KH2PO4 (3.1 g), (NH4)2SO4 (2.5 g), MgSO4·7H2O (0.2 g) and CaCl2·2H2O (0.25 g) in 1 liter adjusted to pH 3.7 with sulfuric acid. Defined growth medium contained (NH4)2SO4 (1.3 g), KH2PO4 (0.28 g), MgSO4·7H2O (0.28 g), CaCl2·2H2O (0.25 g), FeCl3·6H2O (0.02 g), and 100× mineral salt solution (10 ml) (14Mukhopadhyay B. Johnson E.F. Wolfe R.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 5059-5065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 1 liter adjusted to pH 3.5 with sulfuric acid (15Brock T.D. Brock K.M. Belly R.T. Weiss R.L. Arch. Microbiol. 1972; 84: 54-68Google Scholar). Defined medium was supplemented with either d-glucose (0.4%, w/v) or casein hydrolysate (0.4%, w/v). Batch cultures were grown in 75 ml of medium in 150-ml medium bottles, incubated in a convection oven at 85 °C attached to a linear motion shaker (80 rpm).Polyamine Analysis—For analysis by gas chromatographymass spectrometry, cellular polyamines were converted to trifluoroacetamide derivatives. Cells (0.15 g wet mass) were suspended in 0.75 ml of water and lysed by sonication on ice. To the lysate was added 0.75 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v), and the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g. The pellet was reextracted with 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid, and the combined supernatant was extracted twice with 10 ml of diethyl ether. The aqueous solution was evaporated to dryness under vacuum, and the solids were suspended in 0.3 ml of trifluoroacetic anhydride for 30 min at 55 °C. The trifluoroacetyl polyamine derivatives were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry with chemical ionization in the positive ion mode. Mass spectra were consistent with those reported previously (2De Rosa M. De Rosa S. Gambacorta A. Cartenì-Farina M. Zappia V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Shipe Jr., J.R. Hunt D.F. Savory J. Clin. Chem. 1979; 25: 1564-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).For quantitative analysis by HPLC, cellular polyamines were converted to dansyl sulfonamide derivatives (17Gaboriau F. Havouis R. Moulinoux J.-P. Delcros J.-G. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 318: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Extracts of S. solfataricus cells were deproteinized with perchloric acid, and then the neutralized extracts were mixed with dansyl chloride. The derivatives were extracted into cyclohexane, evaporated to dryness by heating under N2, and dissolved in 50% acetonitrile. These samples were applied to a reversed phase HPLC column (Luna C18(2), 150 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex) and eluted using a gradient from 50 to 100% acetonitrile in 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid. Dansyl sulfonamides were detected by their fluorescence with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 515 nm. These derivatives were identified by their co-elution with polyamine standards, and they were quantified by integrating the peak areas of the fluorescence chromatograms. 1,7-Diaminoheptane was used as an internal standard to measure polyamine extraction and derivatization efficiency (73–84% recovery).Arginine Decarboxylase Assay—The rate of arginine decarboxylation was determined using a CO2 capture assay to detect the release of 14CO2 from 14C-labeled arginine (18Giles T.N. Graham D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7376-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Standard reactions (100 μl) contained 12 mm citric acid, 26 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), 10 mm l-arginine-HCl, 6.5–300 nCi of l-[1-14C]arginine (55 mCi mmol–1; American Radiolabeled Chemicals), and enzyme. After a 5-min incubation at 80 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 4 m HCl and heated at 70 °C for 15 min. One unit of activity catalyzes the decarboxylation of 1 μmol of l-arginine/min. A nonlinear regression program (KaleidaGraph version 3.6) estimated steady-state kinetic parameters from the initial rate data fit to the hyperbolic Michealis-Menten-Henri equation.Protein thermostability was tested by preincubating 2 μgof protein at temperatures from 4 to 90 °C for 10 min in citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Arginine decarboxylase activity was determined at room temperature as described above. The temperature dependence of enzyme activity was determined by preincubating enzyme in reaction buffer at temperatures from 4 to 70 °C for 10 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of arginine substrate and incubated at the same temperature.The pH dependence of enzyme activity was analyzed at 70 °C in reactions containing 2 μg of purified enzyme, 10 mm l-arginine, 200 nCi of l-[U-14C]arginine (305 mCi mmol–1;GE Healthcare), and buffer (citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 2.8–6.0), 25 mm sodium potassium phosphate (pH 7.0–8.0), or 6 mm sodium borate (pH 10)).Cloning and Molecular Biology—The MJ1208 gene was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 5MJ1208BN and 3MJ1208B (supplemental Table 2) and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii JAL-1 chromosomal DNA (19Graham D.E. Bock C.L. Schalk-Hihi C. Lu Z. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4055-4059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The product was ligated in the NdeI and BamHI sites of vector pET-19b to produce vector pDG395 (supplemental Table 3). Primers 5SSO0585BN and 3SSO0585B were similarly used to clone the SSO0585 gene from S. solfataricus P2 chromosomal DNA producing vector pDG401. Primers 5SSO0536BN and 3SSO0536B were used to clone the S. solfataricus SSO0536 gene producing vector pDG398. Splicing overlap extension PCR was used to construct two chimeric genes (20Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). For the β536α585 chimera, the T7 promoter and SSO0536ChR primers were used to amplify the 5′-fragment from pDG401, and the SSO0585ChF and T7 terminator primers were used to amplify the 3′-fragment from pDG398. Both gel-purified PCR products were mixed together, the annealed product was extended with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and the chimeric template was amplified with the T7 promoter and T7 terminator primers. This chimeric product was ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-19b to create vector pDG453. To produce the β585α536 chimera, the T7 promoter and SSO0585ChR primers were used to amplify the 5′-fragment from pDG398, and the SSO0536ChF and T7 terminator primers were used to amplify the 3′-fragment from pDG401. The products were spliced as described above and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-19b to create vector pDG483. Plasmids were propagated in E. coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant DNA was sequenced at the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology Core Laboratories DNA Sequencing facility (University of Texas, Austin, TX).Protein Expression and Purification—The polyhistidine-tagged proteins His10-MJ1208, His10-SSO0536, His10-SSO0585, His10-β536α585, and His10-β585α536 were heterologously expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strains transformed with the respective expression vectors (supplemental Table 3). The cells were grown with continuous shaking (250 rpm) at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth with ampicillin (100 μgml–1). Protein expression and cell lysis were performed by standard methods (18Giles T.N. Graham D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7376-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Extracts were heated at 75 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min. Ni2+ affinity chromatography separated the polyhistidine-tagged proteins. The concentrated, desalted proteins were further purified by strong anion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q column (5 × 50 mm, 10 μm; GE Healthcare). This column was equilibrated with buffer A containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and protein was eluted using a gradient to 100% buffer B (buffer A with 1 m NaCl). Purified protein was desalted using a HiTrap Sephadex G-25 column (5 ml; GE Healthcare) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.5) and was concentrated by ultrafiltration (3000 molecular weight cut-off).Protein Size Measurements—Apparent masses of purified, denatured proteins were measured by SDS-PAGE using the Schägger and von Jagow Tris-Tricine system with 12% total and 3.3% cross-linked acrylamide (21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). Protein bands were identified in the gels by silver staining (Pierce) or staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R dye. Measurements of native protein mass and Stokes radius were made by analytical size exclusion chromatography (18Giles T.N. Graham D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7376-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Precipitation with trichloroacetic acid was used to concentrate proteins from collected fractions; these were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the subunit composition of oligomers. For mass spectrometry, affinity-purified proteins were desalted into 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.5) using a Sephadex G-25 desalting column (5 ml; GE Healthcare). Protein ESI-MS was performed by the CRED Analytical Instrumentation Facility at the University of Texas at Austin.S-Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase Assay—AdoMet decarboxylase activity was measured in a coupled reaction using AdoMet synthetase to produce the S-adenosyl-l-[carboxyl-14C]methionine substrate. Reactions contained His10-MJ1208 protein (6 μg), 25 mm Hepes [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid]KOH (pH 8), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm l-methionine, 100 nCi of l-[1-14C]methionine (55 mCi mmol–1; American Radiolabeled Chemicals), and 9.5 mm ATP in a volume of 100 μl (19Graham D.E. Bock C.L. Schalk-Hihi C. Lu Z. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4055-4059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation at 70 °C, purified decarboxylase enzyme (1 μg) was added, and reactions were incubated for 5 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 ml of 4 m HCl, and released 14CO2 was determined using a CO2 capture assay (8Kim A.D. Graham D.E. Seeholzer S.H. Markham G.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Identification of Alternative Substrates and Inhibitors—Substrate analogs and carbonyl-reactive compounds were preincubated with 1 μgofHis10-SSO0536 protein at 80 °C for 10 min before 0.2 mm arginine was added. After 5 min, the reactions were stopped, and the released 14CO2 was measured. The potential inhibitors tested included the arginine analogs l-arginine O-methyl ester, Nα-acetyl l-arginine, l-argininamide, l-canavanine, l-citrulline, d-arginine, l-homoarginine, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, NG-methyl l-arginine, l-ornithine, l-histidine, l-lysine, and l-methionine. Histidine, homoarginine, and canavanine were also tested as potential substrates in reactions without arginine. Primary amines in the reaction product were derivatized with naphthalene 2,3-dicarboxaldehyde and cyanide to produce fluorescent cyanobenz[f]isoindole derivatives, which were analyzed by HPLC as described previously (22Helgadóttir S. Rosas-Sandoval G. Söll D. Graham D.E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The nucleophiles O-methyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride and O-nitrobenzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride were also tested as inhibitors.Phylogenetic Analysis of AdoMetDC Homologs—Amino acid sequences from 13 ArgDC and 19 AdoMetDC homologs were separately aligned using the T-Coffee program (version 4.96) (23Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5383) Google Scholar). The alignments were manually combined using the CIN-EMA5 alignment editor program (24Lord P.W. Selley J.N. Attwood T.K. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 1402-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). From the full alignment, 118 positions that were confidently aligned were chosen for phylogenetic analysis. The proml program from the Phylip package (version 3.66; J. Felsenstein, University of Washington) was used to infer a maximum likelihood phylogeny from this alignment, with the Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of amino acid changes and a γ-distribution of rates (α = 2.4) approximated by three states. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 100 replicates. A similar phylogeny was inferred using the protdist and neighbor programs from the same software package. Full organism names and sequence accession numbers are listed in the supplemental materials.RESULTSPolyamines of S. solfataricus P2—Previous studies identified spermidine and norspermine as the predominant polyamines in Caldariella acidophila (now S. solfataricus DSM 5833) (2De Rosa M. De Rosa S. Gambacorta A. Cartenì-Farina M. Zappia V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and S. solfataricus P1 (3Hamana K. Hamana H. Niitsu M. Samejima K. Sakane T. Yokota A. Microbios. 1994; 79: 109-119PubMed Google Scholar), with traces of norspermidine. However, cells in those experiment were grown on a complex medium containing yeast extract and casamino acids, which could have introduced exogenous polyamines. To identify the polyamines specifically produced by S. solfataricus P2, we grew the cells on a defined glucose minimal medium and extracted polyamines for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis as the trifluoroacetyl derivatives (2De Rosa M. De Rosa S. Gambacorta A. Cartenì-Farina M. Zappia V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The polyamine pool comprised spermidine (76%), norspermine (10%), putrescine (8%), and norspermidine (5%). For comparison, cells grown with casamino acids instead of glucose contained higher total levels of polyamines, including spermidine (72%), norspermine (12%), norspermidine (11%), and putrescine (5%). Both cultures also contained high levels of the osmolyte trehalose (25Nicolaus B. Gambacorta A. Basso A.L. Riccio R. De Rosa M. Grant W.D. System. Appl. Microbiol. 1988; 10: 215-217Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore amino acids in the growth medium slightly changed the distribution and abundance of polyamines in S. solfataricus, although the types of polyamines detected were consistent with those reported previously.Arginine Decarboxylase Activity in P2 Cells—A metabolic reconstruction of polyamine biosynthesis in S. solfataricus P2 from its genome sequence led us to predict that these cells decarboxylate arginine to produce agmatine, and hydrolyze the guanidinium group to produce putrescine (Fig. 1). To establish that arginine decarboxylase is expressed in this strain, we measured ArgDC activity at 80 °C in cell-free extracts of S. solfataricus grown to stationary phase in defined medium with glucose or casamino acids. Extract from glucose-grown cells catalyzed arginine decarboxylation with a specific activity of 160 pmol min–1 mg–1, compared with a specific activity of 400 pmol min–1 mg–1 for extract from cells grown on casamino acids. These cells catalyzed l-arginine decarboxylation at pH 6, consistent with the pathway proposed for polyamine biosynthesis in Fig. 1.The physiological significance of arginine decarboxylase was tested by adding DFMA to S. solfataricus cultures growing in glucose minimal medium. DFMA irreversibly inhibits arginine decarboxylases, and DFMO irreversibly inhibits ornithine decarboxylases (26Shah R. Coleman C.S. Mir K. Baldwin J. Van Etten J.L. Grishin N.V. Pegg A.E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 150-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells inoculated into medium containing 2 mm DFMA had a prolonged lag phase of growth compared with cells inoculated into medium with 2 mm DFMO or no inhibitor. An actively growing culture that was split into three samples (DFMA, DFMO, or control) showed only a small decrease in the growth rate with DFMA. Cells growing in DFMA medium had a specific growth rate of 0.040 ± 0.0013 h–1, compared with cells in DFMO medium (0.045 ± 0.0034 h–1) or control medium (0.044 ± 0.0018 h–1). Cells grown with DFMA contained lower concentrations of putrescine and spermidine than cells grown in control or DFMO media (Table 1). However, cells grown in all three conditions had similar total polyamine contents. S. solfataricus cells adapted to DFMA by substantially increasing their relative levels of norspermine, which does not contain a putrescine core.TABLE 1Polyamine contents of S. solfataricus cellsSampleaS. solfataricus P2 cells were grown in defined glucose medium at 85 °C to an optical density of 0.16 at 600 nm. The culture was divided into an untreated sample, a sample with 3 mm DFMO, and a sample with 3"

Here we report a detailed investigation of the kinetic and functional properties of the protein. In standard assay buffer conditions, Dictyostelium myosin-5b displays high actin affinity in the presence of ADP, fast ATP hydrolysis, and a high steady-state ATPase activity in the presence of actin that is rate limited by ADP release. These properties are typical for a processive motor that can move over long distances along actin filaments without dissociating. Our results show that a physiological decrease in the concentration of free Mg2+-ions leads to an increased rate of ADP release and shortening of the fraction of time the motor spends in the strong actin binding states. Consistently, the ability of the motor to efficiently translocate actin filaments at very low surface densities decreases with decreasing concentrations of free Mg2+-ions. In addition, we provide evidence that the observed changes in Dd myosin-5b motor activity are of physiological relevance and propose a mechanism by which this molecular motor can switch between processive and non-processive movement.

The overall movement has been described as a coordinated stepping process of both heads in a hand-over-hand mechanism that is driven by intramolecular strain (17.Baker J.E. Krementsova E.B. Kennedy G.G. Armstrong A. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5542-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18.Yildiz A. Forkey J.N. McKinney S.A. Ha T. Goldman Y.E. Selvin P.R. Science. 2003; 300: 2061-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). In contrast, non-processive myosins bind to the actin filament perform just one step and then dissociate rapidly. A notable difference between processive and non-processive myosins is displayed in the duty ratio, i.e. the fraction of the total ATPase cycle time a motor spends in the strong actin binding states. Processive myosins have a high duty ratio (>0.5), whereas non-processive myosins display a low duty ratio that is generally far below 0.5. Characteristic kinetic parameters contributing to a high duty ratio thus minimizing early detachment from actin include (i) a fast ATP hydrolysis rate, (ii) a high affinity for actin in the weak binding states, (iii) a high ADP affinity in the actin-bound states, (iv) a rate-limiting ADP dissociation rate, (v) an increased Pi release rate, and (vi) a weak coupling between nucleotide and actin binding sites. The relevance of a high duty ratio for processive movement has been shown by comparison of the kinetic properties of class 5 myosins from different subclasses and organisms. Accordingly, vertebrate myosin-5a is a high duty ratio motor that moves processively along actin filaments (19.De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Recently, a kinetic study of human myosin-5b revealed that this myosin is also characterized by a high duty ratio; however, direct observation of the predicted processivity has not been reported (21.Watanabe S.

It is assumed that these myosins need to function as ensembles for the efficient intracellular translocation of cargo. So far, there is limited information about the kinetic, structural, and mechanoenzymatic properties of class 5 myosins that belong to subclasses other than subclass 5a. Thus, it is difficult to define in detail the parameters and molecular mechanisms that distinguish processive class 5 myosins from non-processive ones. The members of the respective groups are assumed to use different ways to couple conformational changes at the nucleotide binding regions to changes that occur at the actin binding sites during the ATPase cycle. This study provides a detailed kinetic and functional characterization of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin-5b (Dd myosin-5b), 2The abbreviations used are: Dd myosin-5b, Dictyostelium discoideum myosin-5b; Dm myosin-5, Drosophila melanogaster myosin-5; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid; KMG-104AM, 1-(6-acetoxy-2,7-difluoro-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9-yl)-4-oxo-4H-quinolizine-3-carboxylic acid acetoxymethyl ester; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. a heavy chain dimer forming class 5 myosin, which previously has been referred to as MyoJ (27.Peterson M.D. Urioste A.S.

Our investigations reveal that under standard assay conditions the kinetic properties of Dd myosin-5b are similar to those of other processive myosins: ADP-release limiting the actomyosin ATPase cycle, a low degree of coupling between the nucleotide and actin binding sites, and a high duty ratio. We show that changes in the concentrations of free Mg2+-ions that lie in the physiological range modulate the ADP release kinetics of the motor and affect the duty ratio, which is a critical determinant for processivity. Our results show that this particular mechanism enables native Dd myosin-5b to switch between processive and non-processive motor activity in the context of the contractile vacuole. Reagents—Standard chemicals, TRITC-phalloidin, and anti-His antibody were purchased from Sigma; restriction enzymes, polymerases, and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from MBI-Fermentas and Roche Applied Sciences. Plasmid Construction—The oligonucleotides 5′-C GGA TCC ACC ACA TCA ACA ATT-3′ and 5′-GT CTC GAG CAC TAC GAT CCA-3′ were used to isolate a PCR fragment from Dictyostelium AX2 genomic DNA that encodes the 829 amino acids of the motor domain of Dictyostelium myosin-5b (28.Hammer 3rd, J.A. Jung G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7120-7127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The product was cloned into the expression vector pDXA-3H between restriction sites BamHI and XhoI (pDXA-J829) (29.Knetsch M.L. Tsiavaliaris G. Zimmermann S. Ruhl U. Manstein D.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The introduction of the extra XhoI site created mutation T829R in the protein. A motor domain construct fused to two D. discoideum α-actinin repeats (J829-2R) was obtained as the XhoI/SphI fragment from pM790-2R-eYFP (30.Anson M. Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and inserted in the XhoI/SphI-digested pDXA-J829 motor domain expression plasmid. To produce full-length Dd myosin-5b fused to EYFP, base pairs 2692–6947 starting from the open reading frame of the Dd myosin-5b gene were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and inserted into the pDXA-J829 expression vector using XhoI as a unique restriction site. This produced the plasmid pDXA-Dd myosin-5b encoding the full-length protein. It was digested with BamHI and SphI and the gene fragment was cloned into the vector pDXA-EYFP-MCS for the N-terminal fusion with EYFP (29.Knetsch M.L. Tsiavaliaris G. Zimmermann S. Ruhl U. Manstein D.J. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Protein Production and Purification—Plasmids for the high level production of the Dd myosin motor domain constructs were transformed into AX3-Orf+ cells by electroporation as described earlier (31.Kurzawa S.E.

Transformants were grown at 21 °C in HL-5c medium and selected in the presence of 10 μg/ml G418 and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Screening for the production of the recombinant myosins and protein purification was performed as described (33.Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified as described by Lehrer and Kerwar (34.Lehrer S.S. Kerwar G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and pyrene-labeled actin was prepared as described by Criddle et al. (35.Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Kinetic Measurements—ATPase activities were measured at 25 °C with the NADH-coupled assay as described previously (36.Furch M. Fujita-Becker S. Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Manstein D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 797-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Values for kcat and Kapp were calculated from fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Transient kinetic experiments were performed at 20 °C with either a Hi-tech Scientific SF-61 DX single mixing stopped-flow system or an Applied Photophysics PiStar 180 Instrument in MOPS buffer (25 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0) supplemented with varying concentrations of MgCl2 using procedures and kinetic models described previously (37.Bagshaw C.R. FEBS Lett. 1975; 58: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Free Mg2+-ion concentrations were calculated using Maxchelator software as described (38.Durrwang U. Fujita-Becker S. Erent M. Kull F.J. Tsiavaliaris G. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters of nucleotide and actin interactions were analyzed in terms of the model shown in Scheme 1. Direct Functional Assays—Actin-sliding motility was measured as described previously (30.Anson M. Geeves M.A. Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6069-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The movement of more than 200 TRITC-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments was recorded for each individual concentration of free Mg2+-ions. Automated actin filament tracking was performed with the program DiaTrack 3.01 (Semasopht, Switzerland) and data analysis was performed with Origin 7.0 (Originlab, USA). Landing assays were performed as described by Rock et al. (39.Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: Dd myosin-5b molecules were immobilized on nitrocellulose-coated coverslips via anti-penta-His antibodies (concentration range 0.5 to 41 μg/ml) to obtain surface densities between 50 and 4000 myosin molecules/μm2. The assay was started by the addition of TRITC-phalloidin-labeled actin (100 nm) to the motility buffer (described above) containing 1.5 mm Mg2+-ATP and varying concentrations of free Mg2+-ions. The landing events were recorded with an objective type TIRF microscope equipped with a 532 nm diode laser (150 milliwatts). An inverted microscope was used (Olympus IX81) fitted with a 60 × 1.49 NA oil immersion lens (ApoN, Olympus). The landing rate was measured by counting the number of actin filaments that landed and moved ≥0.5 μm in an observation area of ∼12,000 μm2. Cell Imaging—The cellular localization of Dd myosin-5b was assayed by confocal microscopy with an inverted Leica TCS SP2 AOBS microscope. Cells transfected with EYFP-Dd myosin-5b were seeded on glass bottom Petri dishes (coverslip thickness: 160–180 μm), washed twice with Bonner's salts solution (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, and 3 mm CaCl2), and kept in this medium during image acquisition. Images were recorded at 21 °C at one frame per 10-s interval with a 63 × 1.4 NA immersion oil objective. The excitation wavelength was 514 nm; fluorescence emission was detected from 528 to 600 nm. Image processing was done with the Leica Confocal Software. Experiments with the fluorescent dye KMG-104AM were performed according to Ref. 40.Komatsu H. Iwasasa N. Citterio D. Suzuki Y. Kubota T. Tokuno K. Kitamura Y. Oka K. Suzuki K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 16353-16360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar using the TIRF setup described above. Cells were incubated in 10-ml flasks with shaking at 180 rpm in the presence of 40 μm KMG-104AM. KMG-104AM was dissolved in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. After 2 h cells were seeded on Petri dishes and immediately before imaging the solution containing KMG-104AM was replaced by 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, containing 10 mm MgCl2. All kinetic experiments were performed with a single-headed Dd myosin-5b construct (J829) comprising 829 amino acids of the motor domain. Nucleotide and actin interactions were analyzed according to Scheme 1. Steady-state ATPase Activity of Dd Myosin-5b—The steady-state ATPase activity of Dd myosin-5b was measured in the absence and presence of actin in the range from 0 to 60 μm actin. Dd myosin-5b displays a basal ATPase rate (kbasal) of 0.069 s–1. The maximum actin-activated ATPase activity (kcat) is 12.4 s–1 and comparable with the steady-state ATPase rates reported for other class 5 myosins. Half-maximal activation of the ATPase (Kapp) is reached at 21 μm F-actin and the apparent second-order rate constant for actin binding (kcat/Kapp) is 0.59. The obtained steady-state parameters are summarized in Table 1, together with published values of human myosin-5b (H. sapiens myosin-5b), chicken myosin-5a (Gallus gallus myosin-5a), human myosin-5c (H. sapiens myosin-5c), and Drosophila myosin-5 (Dm myosin-5).TABLE 1Steady-state ATPase activitiesMyosinBasal ATPaseMichaelis-Menten parametersActivationcATPase activation = (kcat — basal ATPase)/basal ATPase.kcataValues for kcat and Kapp were calculated from fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.KappaValues for kcat and Kapp were calculated from fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.kcat/KappbThe apparent second order rate constant for actin binding (kcat/Kapp) was obtained from the calculated ratio of both values.s-1s-1μmμm-1s-1Dd myosin-5bdExperimental conditions: 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.3.0.069 ± 0.0112.4 ± 0.521 ± 20.59 ± 0.12179 ± 12Hs myosin-5beWatanabe et al.

Open table in a new tab ATP Binding to Dd Myosin-5b and ATP-induced Dissociation of Acto ·Dd Myosin-5b—ATP binding to the Dd myosin-5b motor domain was monitored from the increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence following the addition of ATP. Fluorescence transients were best fit to single exponentials at all ATP concentrations examined. In the range from 5 to 25 μm ATP, the observed rate constants were linearly dependent upon ATP concentration. The apparent second-order rate constant obtained from the slope corresponds to K1k+2 = 0.47 μm–1 s–1. At higher ATP concentrations the observed rate constants kobs followed a hyperbolic dependence (Fig. 1A, filled circles). At saturating ATP concentrations, kmax defines the maximum rate of the conformational change that corresponds to the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the absence of actin (k+3 + k–3). In the case of Dd myosin-5b this rate is >300 s–1 (Table 2).TABLE 2Summary of the rate and equilibrium constants of the actomyosin interactions in the presence and absence of nucleotidesConstantDd myosin-5baExperimental conditions: 25 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0.Hs myosin-5bbWatanabe et al.

Open table in a new tab ATP binding to acto ·Dd myosin-5b was followed by observing the exponential increase in fluorescence of pyrene-actin as the actomyosin complex dissociates following the addition of excess ATP. The mechanism of ATP-induced fluorescence enhancement was modeled according to Scheme 2, which describes a two-step mechanism for ATP binding to actomyosin. A·M+ATP⇌K1A·M·ATP→k+2A+M·ATPSCHEME 2 At lower ATP concentrations the observed rate constants increased linearly up to 50 μm ATP giving a second-order rate binding constant K1k+2 of 0.19 ± 0.01 μm–1 s–1 (Fig. 1A, filled squares). At higher ATP concentrations the increase of the observed rate constants (kobs) was best described by a hyperbola, approaching a maximum value k+2 of ∼75 s–1 and an apparent equilibrium constant for ATP binding of K1 > 400 μm. ADP Binding to Dd Myosin-5b in the Presence and Absence of Actin—Because binding of ADP to the motor domain of Dd myosin-5b did not result in a change of the fluorescence signal, neither in the absence nor presence of F-actin measurements were performed using the fluorescent analogue mantADP. Binding of mantADP was determined by monitoring the increase in mant-fluorescence upon the addition of increasing concentrations of the fluorescent analogue to the Dd myosin-5b motor domain construct. In the range from 1 to 30 μm mantADP, time courses of mantADP binding to Dd myosin-5b and acto ·Dd myosin-5b followed single exponentials with rates that were linearly dependent on the concentration of nucleotide (Fig. 1B). The apparent second-order rate constants for ADP binding to Dd myosin-5b (k+D) and acto ·Dd myosin-5b (k+AD) were determined from the slopes of the straight lines fitted to the data. The ratio of k+AD = 4.0 μm–1 s–1 and k+D = 0.17 μm–1 s–1 indicates that the rate of ADP binding is more than 20-fold increased in the presence of actin (Table 2). Actin Binding Properties of Dd Myosin-5b—The rate of actin binding was measured by following the exponential decrease in pyrene fluorescence upon binding of excess pyrene-labeled actin to the Dd myosin-5b motor domain. The observed rate constants were linearly dependent upon F-actin concentration over the range studied (Fig. 1C, filled circles). The data were modeled as simple bimolecular reactions. The apparent second-order rate constant of pyrene-actin binding (k+A) was obtained from the slope of the plot giving a value for k+A of 1.17 μm–1 s–1. The presence of 1 mm ADP did not significantly affect the second-order rate binding constant (k+DA) of F-actin to Dd myosin-5b (Fig. 1C, filled squares). Pyrene-actin dissociation from Dd myosin-5b was measured by competition with F-actin after mixing an equilibrated mixture of pyrene-acto ·Dd myosin-5b with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled F-actin. In the absence and presence of ADP, the observed processes could be fit to single exponentials were kobs corresponds directly to k–A and k–DA, respectively. The rates of actin displacement in the absence and presence of 1 mm ADP (k–A = 0.023 ± 0.001 μm–1 s–1 and k–DA = 0.03 ± 0.001 s–1) are very similar and indicate that the tight association of F-actin to Dd myosin-5b is not affected by the presence of excess amounts of ADP. Furthermore, the apparent acto ·Dd myosin-5b affinities (KA and KDA) were determined from the ratio of the r"

We employed crystallographic and functional studies to investigate whether the exchange of arginine to citrulline affects the display of a peptide by two human major histocompatibility antigen class I subtypes, HLA-B*2705 and HLA-B*2709. Both differ only in residue 116 within the peptide binding groove despite their differential association with ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory rheumatic disorder. The crystal structures described here show that a modified self-peptide, pVIPR-U5 (RRKWURWHL; U = citrulline), is presented by the two HLA-B27 molecules in distinct conformations. These binding modes differ not only drastically from each other but also from the conformations exhibited by the non-citrullinated peptide in a given subtype. The differential reactivity of HLA-B27-restricted cytotoxic T cells with modified or unmodified pVIPR supports the structural findings and shows that the presentation of citrullinated peptides has the potential to influence immune responses.

It is catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminases and involves the replacement of the terminal imino group within the side chain of an arginine residue of an extra- or intracellularly expressed protein by an amide group (3.György B.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In autoimmune disorders, in which inflammatory lesions are common, citrullination of proteins is apparently a general phenomenon, irrespective of the association of different MHC genes with a given disease (2.Makrygiannakis D. af Klint E.

Because this protein modification has also consistently been found within synovial tissue from patients with reactive arthritis, an HLA-B27-associated disorder (5.Vossenaar E.R. Smeets T.J.M.

Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 3485-3494Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), fragments derived from citrullinated polypeptides are most likely available for presentation by MHC antigens in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) as well. This is a chronic inflammatory spondyloarthropathy that is even stronger associated with HLA-B27 than reactive arthritis (7.Brewerton D.A. Hart F.D. Nicholls A. Caffrey M. James D.C. Sturrock R.D.

Studies in rats transgenic for HLA-B27 suggest a direct involvement of the HLA-B27 protein in the pathogenesis of AS (11.Hammer R.E. Maika S.D. Richardson J.A. Tang J.P. Taurog J.D. Cell. 1990; 63: 1099-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the association with AS is HLA-B27 allele (“subtype”)-dependent; for example, the ubiquitous, frequent HLA-B*2705 subtype (B*2705 in short) is AS-associated, whereas HLA-B*2709 (B*2709 in short) is not (9.Khan M.A. Mathieu A.

Both molecules are heterotrimeric cell surface glycoproteins consisting of a heavy chain (HC), β2-microglobulin (β2m), and a peptide that is presented to effector cells (13.Madden D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 14.Ziegler A. Loll B. Misselwitz R. Uchanska-Ziegler B. López-Larrea C. Molecular Mechanisms of Spondyloarthropathies. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2008Google Scholar). The B*2705 protein differs in only a single HC amino acid (Asp-116) from B*2709 (His-116) (12.D'Amato M. Fiorillo M.T. Carcassi C. Mathieu A. Zuccarelli A. Bitti P.P. Tosi R. Sorrentino R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3199-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This residue is located at the floor of the peptide binding groove, contributes to shaping the F pocket, and participates in anchoring the peptide C-terminal side chain. The vast majority of the peptides constituting the B*2705 repertoire can also be found in B*2709 (15.Ramos M. Paradela A. Vazquez M. Marina A. Vazquez J. López de Castro J.A. J. Biol.

Some peptides, however, are presented in drastically different conformations by B*2705 and B*2709 (14.Ziegler A. Loll B. Misselwitz R. Uchanska-Ziegler B. López-Larrea C. Molecular Mechanisms of Spondyloarthropathies. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2008Google Scholar, 19.Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J.

Particularly striking is the case of a self-peptide (pVIPR, RRKWRRWHL), which is derived from vasoactive intestinal peptide type 1 receptor (residues 400-408). It is bound in a canonical conformation (13.Madden D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), with the middle of the peptide bulging out of the B*2709 subtype binding groove, whereas B*2705 displays pVIPR in a dual binding mode (19.Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One of the conformations observed in B*2705·pVIPR is identical to that seen in B*2709, whereas a salt bridge between the arginine residue at peptide position 5 (pArg5) and the polymorphic HC residue Asp-116 leads to different HC-peptide contacts in the other conformation. Both conformations are present in approximately equal amounts in the B*2705 peptide binding groove (19.Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We employed the subtypes B*2705 and B*2709 and a citrullinated version of pVIPR (pVIPR-U5; RRKWURWHL, U = citrulline) to investigate whether the introduction of a citrulline (pCir5) into a peptide can lead to changes of its binding mode and whether these changes occur in an HLA-B27 subtype-specific manner. The two crystal structures described here show that the pVIPR-U5 binding mode in a given subtype is diametrically opposed to those exhibited by the unmodified pVIPR peptide. Furthermore, the modified peptide is presented in drastically deviating conformations by the two subtypes. Combined with functional studies employing pVIPR-specific cytotoxic T cells, our model study provides the basis to explain how citrullination can affect molecular interactions between MHC molecules and a peptide as well as T cell responses. Cytotoxicity Assays—Peripheral blood cells were obtained from two B*2705-positive patients with AS. HLA-B27-restricted, pVIPR-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were generated and tested for specificity in a standard 4-h cytotoxicity assay as described previously (19.Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, 51Cr-labeled T2-B*2705 or T2-B*2709 target cells were either incubated in medium alone (negative control) or in medium containing pVIPR or pVIPR-U5 (70 μm, respectively). The effector/target ratio was 12:1 for the MP2 CTL and 15:1 for the CTL MP9 and MP11 as well as BO45. Spontaneous release of 51Cr-labeled, washed target cells was lower than 15%. During the assay, the medium was devoid of peptide. The results summarize the data obtained from two independent experiments. Monoclonal Antibodies and Peptide Binding Assays—The monoclonal antibodies ME1 (anti-HLA-B27, B7, B22, B73 HC·β2m complexes; IgG1 (22.Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A. Hum.

Rohr A. Seitz C. Wonigeit K. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For these tests, the transporter associated with antigen processing 2-negative cell line BM36.1 (24.Kelly A. Powis S.H. Kerr L.-A. Mockridge I. Elliott T. Bastin J. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Trowsdale J. Townsend A. Nature. 1992; 355: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) transfected with B*2705 or B*2709 was employed. The cells were preincubated for 36 h at 26 °C, the last 12 h in serum-free medium, and then incubated for 20 h at 26 °C in the presence of peptide (50 μm). The temperature was then elevated to 37 °C for 4 h followed by a decrease to 4 °C before incubation with appropriate monoclonal reagents and Alexa-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Single color analysis by flow cytometry was done on an EPICS-XL instrument (Coulter, Miami, FL) essentially as described (23.Rehm A. Rohr A. Seitz C. Wonigeit K. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Hum.

Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of the HLA-B27·pVIPR-U5 Complexes—The high performance liquid chromatography-purified, citrulline-modified peptide (pVIPR-U5) was purchased from Alta Bioscience (Birmingham, UK). B*2705 and B*2709 HC and β2m were expressed separately in Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies following the protocol described previously (17.Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A.

Inclusion bodies of B*2705 HC or B*2709 HC and β2m were then dissolved in 50% (w/v) urea and refolded for 2-3 weeks at 4 °C in 400 mm l-arginine-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, and 100 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence of the peptide pVIPR-U5 (25.Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). A refolding period of at least 2 weeks has been found essential for efficient formation of heterotrimeric complexes with HLA-B27 HC (17.Hülsmeyer M. Hillig R.C. Volz A. Rühl M. Schröder W.

The complexes were purified by size exclusion chromatography and concentrated in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.5) to 14.5 mg/ml (B*2705·pVIPR-U5) or 18 mg/ml (B*2709·pVIPR-U5). Crystals of HLA-B27·pVIPR-U5 complexes suitable for x-ray diffraction experiments were obtained using hanging drop vapor diffusion by mixing 1.8 μl of precipitant solution (for B*2705·pVIPR-U5, 24% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 7.5, and for B*2709·pVIPR-U5, 25% PEG 8000, 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 8.0) and 1.8 μl of protein solution and equilibrating the droplets with 750 μl of precipitant solution. Streak seeding was used to improve crystal growth. For B*2705 and B*2709, the crystals obtained were square plates with a maximum size of 45 × 45 × 15 μm. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Crystals of the complexes were cryo-protected by supplementing the precipitant solution with 30% polyethylene glycol 400 (B*2705·pVIPR-U5) and 20% glycerol (B*2709·pVIPR-U5). X-ray data were collected at 100 K on station ID29 at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble using a wavelength of 0.982 Å, processed with DENZO, and scaled with SCALEPACK (26.Otwinowski Z.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). A topography file for the citrullinated peptide was generated using PRODRG server (29.Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Further improvement of the structure was achieved by iterative cycles of manual rebuilding with COOT and maximum-likelihood refinement with REFMAC5. Structure validation was performed using programs WHATIF (32.Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar) and PRO-CHECK (33.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W.

Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and refined to values of Rcryst = 18.4% and Rfree = 22.4% at 1.79 Å and to Rcryst = 18.9% and Rfree = 23.3% at 1.86 Å resolution, respectively (Table 1). Although crystals of these two subtypes with the unmodified pVIPR peptide had been obtained under similar conditions, they crystallized in the different monoclinic P21 space group (19.Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the unit cells are comparable because the axes a and b are isomorphous, whereas the axis c in space group P212121 is almost twice as long as in P21 to accommodate four instead of two crystal asymmetric units. A close relation between molecular packing and C2 symmetries indicates that only marginal changes in crystal packing are required to transform from one space group into the other. Therefore, an in-depth comparison of the structures of B*2705 and B*2709 complexed either with the citrullinated or the unmodified pVIPR peptide is justifiable despite the presence of different space groups in which the complexes crystallized. The structures of HC and β2m of both subtypes in complex with pVIPR-U5 are nearly identical, with root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of 0.6 Å. Asp-116 in B*2705 and His-116 in B*2709 are well defined in the respective electron densities, and this was also the case for the peptide (Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1). However, pVIPR-U5 is bound in grossly different conformations by the two subtypes. It occurs in B*2705 in a canonical, conventional conformation previously termed “p4α” (Ref. 19.Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar; main chain φ (-84.7°) and ψ (-47.5°) torsion angles in an α-helical conformation at p4, and all other φ/ψ torsion angles as in β-strands), with the partially solvent-exposed side chain of pCir5 pointing toward the α2-helix (Fig. 1C). In contrast, pVIPR-U5 displays the non-canonical “p6α” binding mode in the B*2709 subtype (main chain φ (-121.7°) and ψ (27.0°) torsion angles in α-helical conformation at p6, and all other φ/ψ torsion angles as in β-strands). As a consequence, the pCir5 side chain is embedded within the binding groove and forms a hydrogen bond with His-116 of the HC (Fig. 1D; Table 2). Therefore, the pVIPR-U5 conformation in B*2705 is similar to the canonical binding mode observed for pVIPR in both B*2705 and B*2709 (main chain torsion angles φ = -85.2°, and ψ = -32.6°), whereas the B*2709·pVIPR-U5 structure resembles pVIPR bound to the B*2705 subtype in non-canonical conformation (main chain torsion angles φ = -106.4° and ψ = 34.7°) (19.Hülsmeyer M. Fiorillo M.T. Bettosini F. Sorrentino R. Saenger W. Ziegler A. Uchanska-Ziegler B. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The structures of the two subtypes with the citrullinated peptide diverge considerably from p3 to p7 (Fig. 1E). However, a comparison of the B factors of the pVIPR-U5 peptide in the two subtypes shows that they are similar, with the exception of pCir5, which exhibits a much higher flexibility in B*2705 than in B*2709, where it is buried within the binding groove (Fig. 1, F and G). Despite the different peptide binding modes of pVIPR-U5 in B*2705 and B*2709, the primary anchor pArg2 as well as the secondary anchors pArg1 and pLeu9 are bound nearly identically in the two structures to the pockets B, A, and F, respectively, of the peptide binding groove (supplemental Fig. S1). Virtually identical orientations are also found in the case of the solvent-exposed side chain of pHis8 (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3; Fig. 1, C-E). The firm anchoring of pArg2 within the B pocket (37.Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C.

Conformation-dependent pVIPR-U5 Interactions in Complexes with B*2705 and B*2709—As expected from the differential anchoring of the central portion of the two peptides, the Cα backbones and the side chains of the intervening amino acids from p3 to p7 differ drastically in their orientations (Fig. 1E). pArg1 and pHis8 as well as pTrp4 are fully solvent-accessible, and pCir5 and pArg6 as well as pTrp7 are partially solvent-accessible in B*2705 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, pCir5 and pArg6 are the most flexible peptide side chains, as indicated by elevated B values (Fig. 1F). In the other subtype, however, pCir5 and pTrp7 are buried, and pTrp4 and pArg6 are fully solvent-exposed, whereas pLys3 is partly accessible (Fig. 1D). The re-orientation of the peptide in B*2709 leads also to loss of pCir5 flexibility; only pArg6 retains increased B values (Fig. 1G). In B*2705 (supplemental Fig. S2; Table 2), the middle portion of the citrullinated peptide (p3 to p7) forms two very short (2.7 Å) hydrogen bonds with Gln-155 of the HC (pCir5N8 → Gln155O and pTrp7NE1 → Gln155OE1) and a further, longer (3.1 Å) hydrogen bond (pLys3N → Tyr99OH). In addition, there are three intrapeptide hydrogen bonds (pLys3O → pArg6NH2, pLys3NZ → pCir5O1, pTrp4O → pArg6NH2) and numerous van der Waals contacts (not shown) that stabilize the whole assembly. In contrast, it is the highly characteristic anchoring of the citrullinated residue at p5 in the non-canonical conformation of the peptide in B*2709·pVIPR-U5 (supplemental Fig. S3; Table 2) that distinguishes the binding modes of the peptid"
https://openalex.org/W2052994233,"Fe65L1, a member of the Fe65 family, is an adaptor protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its C-terminal phosphotyrosine interaction/phosphotyrosine binding (PID/PTB) domain. In the present study, the solution structures of the C-terminal PID domain of mouse Fe65L1, alone and in complex with a 32-mer peptide (DAAVTPEERHLSKMQQNGYENPTYKFFEQMQN) derived from the cytoplasmic domain of APP, were determined using NMR spectroscopy. The C-terminal PID domain of Fe65L1 alone exhibits a canonical PID/PTB fold, whereas the complex structure reveals a novel mode of peptide binding. In the complex structure, the NPTY motif forms a type-I β-turn, and the residues immediately N-terminal to the NPTY motif form an antiparallel β-sheet with the β5 strand of the PID domain, the binding mode typically observed in the PID/PTB·peptide complex. On the other hand, the N-terminal region of the peptide forms a 2.5-turn α-helix and interacts extensively with the C-terminal α-helix and the peripheral regions of the PID domain, representing a novel mode of peptide binding that has not been reported previously for the PID/PTB·peptide complex. The indispensability of the N-terminal region of the peptide for the high affinity of the PID-peptide interaction is consistent with NMR titration and isothermal calorimetry data. The extensive binding features of the PID domain of Fe65L1 with the cytoplasmic domain of APP provide a framework for further understanding of the function, trafficking, and processing of APP modulated by adapter proteins.

APP is an integral transmembrane glycoprotein composed of a large extracellular domain, a single membrane-spanning region, and a short cytoplasmic domain (see Fig. 1A). The APP gene encodes several different isoforms of APP as a consequence of alternative splicing. The three major isoforms are APP770, APP751, and APP695, which all possess the same 47-residue cytoplasmic domain. The functional role of APP remains unclear; however, several lines of evidence suggest that APP is part of a diverse protein-protein interaction network, which is centered on the short cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain participates in the important cellular processes of intracellular trafficking and secretion of APP and signal transduction via interactions with adaptor and signaling proteins, respectively. Several proteins reportedly interact with the cytoplasmic domain of APP. These include heterotrimeric G protein Go (2.Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Matsuura Y. Takahashi S. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Ogata E.

They recognize the NPTY sequence within the cytoplasmic domain of APP.The Fe65 family proteins, Fe65, Fe65L1, and Fe65L2, are adaptor proteins that possess three protein-protein interaction domains: one WW domain and two PID/PTB domains (see Fig. 1B) (15.Russo T.

The N- and C-terminal PID/PTB domains are referred to as PID1 and PID2, respectively. The three protein-protein interaction domains are well conserved among the Fe65 family proteins, sharing 50–60% amino acid sequence identity, whereas most of the remaining parts of the proteins are unrelated. Among the three Fe65 family proteins, the most significant difference is their tissue distribution: Fe65 mRNA is neuron-specific (16.Duilio A. Zambrano N. Mogavero A.R. Ammendola R. Cimino F. Russo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas Fe65L1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed (7.Guénette S.Y. Chen J. Jondro P.D. Tanzi R.E. Proc. Natl.

For all three Fe65 family proteins, the C-terminal PID/PTB domain (PID2) was demonstrated to be sufficient for their binding to the cytoplasmic domain of APP (4.Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B.

The 32-residue-long peptide (termed APP-32mer in Fig. 1A), including the NPTY motif, is much longer than the peptide that was reported previously to be recognized by the PID/PTB domain. The YENPTY sequence is also a sorting motif, or an internalization motif, required for trafficking of APP into the endocytic pathway (18.Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W.

Here we report the solution structure of PID2 of mouse Fe65L1 in the free form and in complex with APP-32mer and the characterization of their interaction by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR spectroscopy. Among the three Fe65 family proteins, we selected PID2 of Fe65L1 as a target because the mRNA encoding Fe65L1 is ubiquitously expressed. To facilitate the structure determination of the complex of PID2 of Fe65L1 and APP-32mer, we designed several different chimeric proteins in which the corresponding regions of PID2 and APP-32mer were integrated. The complex structure reported here reveals a novel peptide binding mode as compared with those of the canonical PID domains that recognize the NPX(p)Y motif ((p) indicates that tyrosine may be phosphorylated).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of PID2 of Fe65L1—The DNA fragment encoding PID2 of mouse Fe65L1 (amino acid residues Pro582 to Cys704; Swiss-Prot accession number Q9DBR4) was amplified via PCR from the RIKEN full-length enriched mouse cDNA library (Clone ID 1200015I07) (22.RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group Phase II Team and FANTOM ConsortiumNature. 2001; 409: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 23.FANTOM Consortium and RIKEN Genome Exploration Research Group Phase I & II TeamNature. 2002; 420: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) and was cloned into the plasmid vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) as a fusion with an N-terminal His tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site.

The solution was then desalted on a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl. The His tag was cleaved by an incubation at 30 °C for 1 h with tobacco etch virus protease. The sample was then loaded on a TALON affinity column, which was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, and was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and 500 mm imidazole. The flow-through fraction was desalted on a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA. The sample was then loaded on a HiTrap Q column, which was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, and was eluted with a concentration gradient of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 m NaCl. Finally the sample was purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex75 column, which was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The fraction containing the PID domain was concentrated to 1.49 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science)). For the NMR structure determination, a 0.84 mm sample of free PID2 was prepared in 20 mm deuterated Tris buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm deuterated DTT, 0.02% NaN3, and 10% 2H2O, 90% 1H2O. The protein sample for the NMR measurements consisted of 136 amino acid residues. The first 7 amino acid residues at the N terminus (GSSGSSG) and the last 6 residues at the C terminus (SGPSSG) were derived from the linker sequence used in the expression and purification system.NMR Sample Preparation of the PID2 and APP-32mer Complex—To prepare the sample of the PID2 and APP-32mer complex for NMR measurement, a solution of non-labeled APP-32mer (Toray Research Center, Tokyo, Japan), dissolved in buffer A (20 mm deuterated Tris buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm deuterated DTT, 0.02% NaN3, and 10% 2H2O, 90% 1H2O) with pH adjustment, was gradually added to 13C,15N-labeled PID2, which had been buffer-exchanged in buffer A, until the free form of PID2 was completely converted into the peptide-bound form as confirmed by the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The final concentration of PID2 was 0.37 mm.Design and Expression of the PID2-APP-32mer Chimera—To prepare the PID2-APP-32mer chimera, the gene encoding PID2 was fused to the cDNA of APP-32mer (amino acid residues Asp739*4 to Asn770*; Swiss-Prot accession number P12023), and the resulting gene was inserted within the plasmid vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), incorporating an N-terminal His tag and a tobacco etch virus cleavage site. The 13C,15N-labeled chimera was synthesized by the cell-free protein expression system (24.Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Yoshida Y. Tsutsui M. Ito Y. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 25.Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Matsuda N. Matsuda T. Nakajima R. Tanaka A. Yokoyama S. J. Struct. Funct.

NMR. 2007; 37: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Three kinds of chimeras, differing in the relative positions of PID2 and APP-32mer in the protein, were designed for the structure determination (Fig. 1C). The three chimeras were designated as I, II, and III, respectively. The construct of Chimera I included, from the N to the C terminus, a His tag, APP-32mer, a 14-residue linker (SGSSGSSGSSGSSG), and PID2. The Chimera II construct consisted of a His tag, APP-32mer, a 23-residue linker containing a protease Factor Xa cleavage site (SGPSSGIEGRGSSGSSGSSGSSG), and PID2; the construct of Chimera III included a His tag, PID2, the 23-residue linker, and APP-32mer. The 13C,15N-labeled chimeras were synthesized and purified as described below. After the His tag cleavage in the purification procedure, Chimera I consisted of 176 amino acid residues; both Chimeras II and III consisted of 185 amino acid residues. The first 7 amino acid residues at the N terminus (GSSGSSG) in each sample were derived from the linker sequence used in the expression and purification system.Purification of the PID2-APP-32mer Chimeras—The cell-free reaction solution of each chimera was adsorbed onto a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences), which was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 m NaCl and 20 mm imidazole, and was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl and 500 mm imidazole. To cleave the His tag, the eluted sample was incubated with tobacco etch virus protease at 30 °C for 3 h for Chimeras I and II and overnight for Chimera III. The sample was then loaded on a HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column, which was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. The fractionated dialysate was applied to a HiTrap chelating column, which was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole, and was eluted with a concentration gradient of imidazole (500 mm final concentration). The eluted fraction of each chimera sample was concentrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini). Each NMR sample contained ∼1.0 mm of uniformly 13C,15N-labeled chimera in 20 mm deuterated Tris buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm deuterated DTT, 0.02% NaN3, and 10% 2H2O, 90% 1H2O.ITC Measurements—ITC measurements were performed on a MicroCal VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (Micro-Cal, Inc.). HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT) was used for the ITC measurements. PID2 was buffer-exchanged in the ITC buffer, and APP-32mer was dissolved in the same buffer with pH adjustment. The concentrations of PID2 and APP-32mer used for the ITC measurement were 0.109 and 1.640 mm, respectively, as determined using UV absorbance values measured at 280 nm. A degassed sample of PID2 was kept at room temperature (25 °C) and was stirred at 307 rpm in a 1.4-ml reaction cell. For each titration, 5-μl aliquots of peptide were delivered into the PID2 solution at 240-s intervals to allow complete equilibration. The final ratio of peptide to protein reached 2:1 at the end of the titration. Heat transfer was measured as a function of elapsed time. The heat of dilution, obtained by titrating the identical peptide solution into the reaction cell containing only the HEPES buffer, was subtracted prior to analysis. The corrected titration curve was fitted with a one-site model, and the thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the Origin software (version 7.0) provided by MicroCal.Titration Experiments by NMR—NMR titration experiments were carried out by adding the unlabeled APP-32mer solution to 13C,15N-labeled PID2. In total, four NMR samples were prepared for the titration experiment. In the four NMR samples, the concentration of PID2 was maintained at 0.050 mm, and the concentration of APP-32mer was varied to generate a series of different PID2:APP-32mer molar ratios (1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:1.5). The buffer used for the APP-32mer titration was the same as that used for the structure determination. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured after each titration step, and the signals were monitored by observing the changes in the chemical shifts of the amide signals in 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The weighted chemical shift change (in ppm units) of the amide proton (ΔδHN) and nitrogen (ΔδN) was calculated according to the following equation: Δδtotal = [(ΔδHNWHN)2 + (ΔδNWN)2]½ where WHN = 1 and WN = 0.154 (27.Ayed A.

Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR data for PID2 in the free form were recorded at 298 K on Varian Inova 600- and 900-MHz spectrometers equipped with pulsed field gradient probes. The NMR data for the three chimeras, Chimera I, Chimera II, and Chimera III, and PID2 complexed with non-labeled APP-32mer were recorded at 296 K on a Bruker AVANCE 700-MHz spectrometer, which was equipped with a triple resonance cryoprobe, and on AVANCE 800- and 900-MHz spectrometers. Sequence-specific resonance assignments were made using the standard triple resonance techniques (28.Bax A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 738-744Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For PID2 complexed with the non-labeled APP-32mer, two-dimensional [F2] 13C,15N-filtered total correlation spectroscopy and two-dimensional [F1,F2] 13C,15N-filtered NOESY (29.Iwahara J. Wojciak J.M. Clubb R.T. J. Biomol.

Wojciak J.M. Clubb R.T. J. Biomol.

The filter-related spectra were measured on an 800-MHz spectrometer. All of the spectra were processed using the NMRPipe software package (31.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11388) Google Scholar). The programs KUJIRA (32.Kobayashi N. Iwahara J. Koshiba S. Tomizawa T. Tochio N. Güntert P. Kigawa T.

Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar) were used for visualization of the NMR spectra and chemical shift assignments.Structure Calculations—For the structure calculations of PID2 in the free form, Chimera I, Chimera II, and Chimera III, 15N-edited NOESY and 13C-edited NOESY with 80-ms mixing times were used to determine the distance restraints. Dihedral angle restraints were derived using the program TALOS (35.Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). The stereospecific assignments of the Val and Leu methyl groups were determined when they were distinguishable from their NOE patterns. Automated NOE cross-peak assignments and structure calculations with torsion angle dynamics were performed using the program CYANA (36.Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

The dihedral angle restraints for APP-32mer were only added in its secondary structural region by checking the corresponding NOE patterns. In addition, a total of five NOE peak lists were used in the complex structure calculation. Among the five peak lists, two were obtained from three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and three were obtained from two-dimensional [F2] 13C,15N-filtered NOESY, three-dimensional 13C,15N F1-filtered, 13C F3-edited NOESY, and three-dimensional 13C,15N F1-filtered, 15N F3-edited NOESY. Dihedral angle restraints and stereospecific assignments of the Val and Leu methyl groups were obtained in a similar manner as described above. The peak list from two-dimensional [F2] 13C,15N-filtered NOESY provided information about the intramolecular NOEs of APP-32mer and the intermolecular NOEs bet"
https://openalex.org/W2074963580,"Eph receptors are the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Together with their ligands, the ephrins, they fulfill multiple biological functions. Aberrant expression of Ephs/ephrins leading to increased Eph receptor to ephrin ligand ratios is a critical factor in tumorigenesis, indicating that tight regulation of Eph and ephrin expression is essential for normal cell behavior. The 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of transcripts play an important yet widely underappreciated role in the control of protein expression. Based on the assumption that paralogues of large gene families might exhibit a conserved organization of regulatory elements in their 3'UTRs we applied a novel bioinformatics/molecular biology approach to the 3'UTR sequences of Eph/ephrin transcripts. We identified clusters of motifs consisting of cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs), AU-rich elements (AREs) and HuR binding sites. These clusters bind multiple RNA-stabilizing and destabilizing factors, including HuR. Surprisingly, despite its widely accepted role as an mRNA-stabilizing protein, we further show that binding of HuR to these clusters actually destabilizes Eph/ephrin transcripts in tumor cell lines. Consequently, knockdown of HuR greatly modulates expression of multiple Ephs/ephrins at both the mRNA and protein levels. Together our studies suggest that overexpression of HuR as found in many progressive tumors could be causative for disarranged Eph receptor to ephrin ligand ratios leading to a higher degree of tissue invasiveness."

https://openalex.org/W2076755770,"We develop a new model that explains how the cerebellum may generate the timing in classical delay eyeblink conditioning. Recent studies show that both Purkinje cells (PCs) and inhibitory interneurons (INs) have parallel signal processing streams with two time scales: an AMPA receptor-mediated fast process and a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated slow process. Moreover, one consistent finding is an increased excitability of PC dendrites (in Larsell's lobule HVI) in animals when they acquire the classical delay eyeblink conditioning naturally, in contrast to in vitro studies, where learning involves long-term depression (LTD). Our model proposes that the delayed response comes from the slow dynamics of mGluR-mediated IP3 activation, and the ensuing calcium concentration change, and not from LTP/LTD. The conditioned stimulus (tone), arriving on the parallel fibers, triggers this slow activation in INs and PC spines. These excitatory (from PC spines) and inhibitory (from INs) signals then interact at the PC dendrites to generate variable waveforms of PC activation. When the unconditioned stimulus (puff), arriving on the climbing fibers, is coupled frequently with this slow activation the waveform is amplified (due to an increased excitability) and leads to a timed pause in the PC population. The disinhibition of deep cerebellar nuclei by this timed pause causes the delayed conditioned response. This suggested PC-IN interaction emphasizes a richer role of the INs in learning and also conforms to the recent evidence that mGluR in the cerebellar cortex may participate in slow motor execution. We show that the suggested mechanism can endow the cerebellar cortex with the versatility to learn almost any temporal pattern, in addition to those that arise in classical conditioning."
https://openalex.org/W2143123706,"Dominant disease alleles are attractive therapeutic targets for allele-specific gene silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA). Sialuria is a dominant disorder caused by missense mutations in the allosteric site of GNE, coding for the rate-limiting enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase. The resultant loss of feedback inhibition of GNE-epimerase activity by CMP-sialic acid causes excessive production of free sialic acid. For this study we employed synthetic siRNAs specifically targeting the dominant GNE mutation c.797G>A (p.R266Q) in sialuria fibroblasts. We demonstrated successful siRNA-mediated down-regulation of the mutant allele by allele-specific real-time PCR. Importantly, mutant allele-specific silencing resulted in a significant decrease of free sialic acid, to within the normal range. Feedback inhibition of GNE-epimerase activity by CMP-sialic acid recovered after silencing demonstrating specificity of this effect. These findings indicate that allele-specific silencing of a mutated allele is a viable therapeutic strategy for autosomal dominant diseases, including sialuria."
https://openalex.org/W1979080837,"Selenium is an important nutrient. The lack of selenium will suppress expression of various enzymes that will lead to cell abnormality and diseases. However, high concentrations of free selenium are toxic to the cell because it adversely affects numerous cell metabolic pathways. In Methanococcus vannielii, selenium transport in the cell is established by the selenium-binding protein, SeBP. SeBP sequesters selenium during transport, thus regulating the level of free selenium in the cell, and delivers it specifically to the selenophosphate synthase enzyme. In solution, SeBP is an oligomer of 8.8-kDa subunits. It is a symmetric pentamer. The solution structure of SeBP was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Each subunit of SeBP is composed of an alpha-helix on top of a 4-stranded twisted beta-sheet. The stability of the five subunits stems mainly from hydrophobic interactions and supplemented by hydrogen bond interactions. The loop containing Cys(59) has been shown to be important for selenium binding, is flexible, and adopts multiple conformations. However, the cysteine accessibility is restricted in the structure, reducing the possibility of the binding of free selenium readily. Therefore, a different selenium precursor or other factors might be needed to facilitate opening of this loop to expose Cys(59) for selenium binding."

Human (h) β3 subunits assemble to form homomeric surface receptors in somatic cells, but hβ1 subunits do not.

The three sets likely result in three modes of assembly. Mode 1 expression results from a single amino acid change at residue hβ1 Asp-37.

A small body of literature exists, describing expression and function of β1 homomeric receptors in Xenopus oocytes and somatic cell lines (21Cestari I.N. Min K.T. Kulli J.C. Yang J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This literature, however, shows unclear and often contradictory results depending on expression system and species of subunit used. This study uses a somatic cell expression system (QT6 quail fibroblast cells) and compares hβ1 and hβ3 subunits to find assembly determinants in hβ3 that are not present in hβ1. The results indicate additional regions of the extracellular domain, which are important in conferring competence for assembly, and suggest that intrasubunit interactions can be of critical importance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs—A cDNA construct for the hβ1 subunit, GenBank™ accession number X14767, was obtained from David Weiss (University of Texas, San Antonio), originally cloned by Paul Whiting (23Hadingham K.L. Wingrove P. Le Bourdelles B. Palmer K.J. Ragan C.I. Whiting P.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 970-975PubMed Google Scholar); and hβ3, accession number M82919, was obtained from Geoffrey White, (Neurogen, Bradford, CT). Construction of the Myc-tagged rat (r) α1 subunit was described previously (24Darbandi-Tonkabon R. Hastings W.R. Zeng C.M. Akk G. Manion B.D. Bracamontes J.R. Steinbach J.H. Mennerick S.J. Covey D.F. Evers A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13196-13206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Restriction sites were introduced into each cDNA for making chimeras between hβ1 and hβ3. Mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or pAltered Sites II (Promega, Madison, WI). The FLAG (F) epitope was inserted between amino acids 4 and 5 of the mature peptide for both hβ1 and hβ3 using the pAltered Sites II mutagenesis kit. FLAG-tagged constructs were transferred to pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Site-specific mutagenesis was done using QuikChange.Cell Culture—Quail fibroblasts (QT6 cells; initially provided by Dr. J. Merlie, Washington University) were maintained in Medium 199 (Earle's salts) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Invitrogen), 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were passaged twice each week, maintaining subconfluent cultures.ELISA and Transfection—Whole cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was done as described by Bonnert et al. (5Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S. le Bourdelles B. Heavens R.P. Smith D.W. Hewson L. Rigby M.R. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Brown N. Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9891-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The primary antibodies, anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and anti-Myc (9E10, Invitrogen), were used at a concentration of 2 μg/ml. The secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (GE Healthcare) was used at a dilution of 1:100. Each subunit combination was transfected into 5 wells of a 24-well plate, of which three were for ELISA and two for assaying total protein. QT6 cells were transfected according to published methods (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 5-9Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells per well. The next day, they were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 + 5% fetal bovine serum, followed by the addition of 1.5 ml of fresh medium to each well. The precipitation reaction for each well contained 3 μg of cDNA, 7.5 μl of CaCl2 (2.5 m stock), distilled H2Ouptoa 75-μl volume, and 75 μl of 2× BES-buffered solution (50 mm BES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.95). The mixture was precipitated for 5 min at room temperature, and 150 μl of the precipitation solution was added to each well. Cells were incubated overnight in 5% CO2. The next day, transfected cells were washed three times with complete growth medium. The 2nd day after transfection, each well was aspirated and blocked with 0.5 ml of 4% milk phosphate-buffered saline (MPBS: 4% powdered milk, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) for 30 min at room temperature. The blocking solution was then aspirated, and 0.5 ml of primary antibody in MPBS was added to three wells for ELISA. Following incubation for 1 h at room temperature, wells were washed once with MPBS. After that, 0.5 ml of MPBS containing secondary antibody was added to the wells for ELISA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells for protein analysis were maintained in MPBS until the final MPBS washes. Wells were aspirated and washed three times with MPBS and three times with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). Next, 0.5 ml of ELISA reagent, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) was added to the wells designated for ELISA and incubated for 30 min at room temperature protected from light. After incubation, 250 μl of reaction mix was transferred from each well to a 96-well plate; absorbance was read at 405 nm using a microplate reader (model 550, Bio-Rad).ELISA results were calculated as absorbance/mg of protein. Values presented in this paper for homomeric expression are given as absorbance/mg normalized to hβ3F expression performed in parallel. Heteromeric assembly was determined by measuring the Myc epitope on the α1myc subunit and normalized to hβ3myc expression. The empty vector (pcDNA3) was transfected as a negative control in each experiment, and the signal was subtracted from the other data. Statistical analysis was performed using Systat 7 (Systat Software Inc., Point Richmond, CA).Protein Assay—The remaining two transfected wells were assayed for protein using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Bicinchoninic acid reagent (0.5 ml) was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the DNA was sheared using a 1-ml pipetter, and 250 μl from each well was transferred to a 96-well plate. The absorbance was read at 550 nm in a microplate reader. It was observed that when the protein content was less than 10 μg per well, the results were inconsistent. Therefore, if the hβ3F control protein content was below 10 μg, all data collected from that set of transfections were discarded. If a particular construct gave a value below 10 μg, data from that construct were discarded. There was no systematic difference between the protein values of cells transfected with the various constructs. Linearity curves for each assay were determined, and absorbance readings were accepted in that range. If a sample was predicted to fall outside the range of linearity, it was diluted with deionized water by half. Such dilution was observed not to affect the molar absorption coefficients of the chromogens.Electrophysiology—Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were made from transiently transfected QT6 cells using standard methods (27Li P. Covey D.F. Steinbach J.H. Akk G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 2015-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), to determine whether the various constructs could assemble into functional receptors on the cell surface. Pentobarbital was dissolved in external solution and applied by a multichannel perfuser (SF-77B; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). The goal of these experiments was to examine the function of receptors on the cell surface, rather than to assay levels of expression. Accordingly, cells expressing high levels of transfected receptors were identified using beads with coupled anti-FLAG antibody (20Ueno S. Zorumski C. Bracamontes J. Steinbach J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 931-938PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs except hβ1F produced extensive bead binding. Cultures transfected with hβ1F only had a few cells per dish that bound beads. Previous studies have shown that untransfected cells show no responses to GABAergic drugs (20Ueno S. Zorumski C. Bracamontes J. Steinbach J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 931-938PubMed Google Scholar). Pentobarbital was used to activate homomeric receptors, as previous studies have shown that it activates homomeric hβ1 and hβ3 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, whereas GABA does not (28McCann C.M. Bracamontes J. Steinbach J.H. Sanes J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5149-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Molecular Modeling—Modeling of the β subunits was done using the Deep View/Swiss-PDB viewer freeware version 3.7. Two copies of the hβ3 protein sequence from residues Ser-10 to Arg-216 were aligned against the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) using the alignment proposed for hβ2 by Cromer et al. (29Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The α-carbon atoms of the aligned residues were then threaded upon the crystal structure of the AChBP to obtain two, three-dimensional adjacent copies of the subunit. A few gaps with missing β3 residues occurred upon threading. The missing residues were built back into the subunits. The hβ1 subunit was then similarly aligned and threaded upon the rebuilt hβ3 model. Models of individual mutant subunits of hβ1 were also made. Viewing and graphic display of these models were done using the three-dimensional molecule viewer of the Vector NTI Advance version 10.0.1 software (Invitrogen).RESULTSCell Surface Expression of hβ1 and hβ3—We used the binding of antibody to an extracellular epitope (FLAG) engineered into the N-terminal region of the hβ3 and hβ1 subunits to assay the surface expression of assembled receptors (inclusion of FLAG is indicated by, for example, hβ1F). The data are presented as the surface expression relative to that for hβ3F, measured in the same experiment. ELISA data indicate that hβ1F does not significantly express on the cell surface, expressing at only 3.9 ± 3.8% of the level of hβ3F (mean ± S.D.; n = 109 separate experiments) (Table 1). Co-transfection of hβ3 and hβ1F resulted in the rescue and surface expression of hβ1F (42 ± 20%, n = 5). Furthermore, co-expression of hβ3F and hβ1F resulted in identical amounts of FLAG epitope recognized on the surface as when hβ3F alone was expressed (99%; 111%, two experiments), suggesting that the heteropentamers have essentially equal total expression as the hβ3 homopentamers. Although it is known that the hβ1 subunit co-assembles with α subunits, co-assembly with hβ3 is suggestive that specific assembly determinants may be resolved because of the high homology between these subunits.TABLE 1Surface expression of wild type hβ1 and hβ3 and major chimeric subunit constructsConstructExpressionaMean ± S.D. was for expression as percentage of homomeric hβ3 expression measured in the same experimentNbN indicates number of separate experimentsPcResults of analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post hoc correction.

There are 13 amino acid differences between residues in each region. Our hβ3 differs from the published sequence by containing Val-45 rather than Ala-45 as reported previously (30Wagstaff J. Chaillet J.R. Lalande M. Genomics. 1991; 11: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This difference actually has some consequences for assembly, as shown below.Fig. 1 also shows secondary structural features identified in the acetylcholine-binding protein (31Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar). We used AChBP as a template for the homology model of the GABAA subunits we studied (29Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The structural features seen in AChBP will be referred to as, for example, loop 10 and β-sheet 9.Mutations of hβ1F Residues between 169 and 201—Previous studies have shown that the N terminus of the GABAA receptor contains major determinants for regulating assembly and surface expression. Taylor et al. (13Taylor P.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Connolly C.N. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that four amino acid substitutions (D171G, N173K, T179E, and K180R) in mouse (m) β2, which alter the residues to those found in mβ3, confer the ability to self-assemble. Accordingly, we initially examined the influence of mutations in hβ1 between residues 169 and 201, changing the residues in hβ1 to the homologous residues in hβ3. The mutated amino acids were grouped into four regions designated as A through D (Fig. 1). (The residues identified by Taylor et al. (13Taylor P.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Connolly C.N. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) fall in the A and B regions.) The possible roles of these residues in hβ1 were examined individually and in groups, with no significant increase in expression (supplemental Table). Finally, all the divergent amino acids between residues 169 and 201 were substituted, but no increase in expression was observed (3.3 ± 10%, n = 11). We confirmed that the four mutations of the mβ2 subunit identified by Taylor et al. (13Taylor P.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Connolly C.N. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6360-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) significantly increase surface expression of mβ2 (from 6 ± 6%, n = 8, to 20 ± 6%, n = 4). These results indicate that hβ1 assembly must be constrained differently than mβ2, and that other regions of the subunit are necessary to confer surface expression of hβ1 homomers.Chimeras of hβ1 and hβ3—Chimeras between hβ1 and hβ3 were then made to locate the sequences determining assembly. Key chimeras were made at amino acid 145 (X1) between hβ1 and hβ3. The location of the junction is shown in Fig. 1, and the chimeric subunit will be designated by, for example, X1 hβ1/hβ3 for the construct with hβ1 sequence from the N terminus to the join and hβ3 sequence to the C terminus. This position separates the two regions of sequence divergence (Fig. 1). Expression of X1F hβ1/hβ3 was low, similar to that of hβ1F (Table 1). The inverse chimera, X1F hβ3/hβ1, however, expressed as well as hβ3F. These results clearly show that the amino acid residues between positions 169 and 201 do not have to be changed for robust expression, if the appropriate sequence exists in the first 73 residues of the N terminus. The low expression of X1F hβ1/hβ3 confirms that the ABCD region is not sufficient to induce assembly. These results prompted two questions. First, which amino acids in X1F hβ3/hβ1 permit expression? Second, which amino acids in the X1F hβ1/hβ3 chimera, if changed, will allow for expression? One might expect that these two questions would lead to the same result. However, this experimental approach led to the discovery of distinct modes of expression for mutant hβ1 receptors, unmasking three groups of assembly determinants.Mode 1 Expression, Mutations of hβ1(Asp-37)—In contrast to X1F hβ1/hβ3, which did not yield surface homomers, the inverse chimeric subunit X1F hβ3/hβ1 expressed as well as hβ3F (Table 1). Through the use of chimeric subunits and site-directed mutagenesis, the single residue at position 37 was found to play a major role in determining whether hβ1 subunits assemble on the cell surface as homomultimers (Fig. 2; Table 2). Hβ1F (D37C) expressed at 56%, a 14-fold increase over hβ1F. X1F hβ3(C37D)/hβ1 resulted in a significant loss of expression (to 18 ± 11%, n = 18) compared with X1F hβ3/hβ1, confirming the influence of residue 37.FIGURE 2Graphical presentation of the results used to define mode 1 assembly.

Other amino acids substituted at position 37 were alanine, glycine, asparagine, lysine, and glutamate. All substitutions except hβ1F (D37G) showed significantly more expression than hβ1F (Table 2). The expression of these substitutions did not differ significantly from that of hβ1 (D37C), except for the glycine substitution, which expressed as poorly as wild type hβ1. The physical characteristics of these substituted residues vary. Both alanine and glycine conserve the hydrophobic character of the cysteine residue. Asparagine is about the same volume as aspartate (96 and 91 Å3, respectively) and retains the polar nature but is uncharged. Finally, glutamate conserves the charge of aspartate in hβ1. From these observations we conclude that the presence of aspartate at position 37 has a specific, dominant-negative, effect on homomeric assembly of the hβ1 subunit.To visualize the location of Asp-37, we performed homology-based structural modeling of the extracellular domain of the hβ1 subunit. Crystallography of the AChBP (31Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K.

A thrombin-inducible expression of smooth muscle-specific α-actin and myosin heavy chain requires transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and a biphasic activation of ERK1/2. Here we demonstrate that the sustained second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation requires de novo RNA and protein synthesis. Depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D or disruption of transit between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus by brefeldin A prevented the second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We thus conclude that synthesis and trafficking of a plasma membrane-resident protein may be critical intermediates. Analysis of the expression of protease-activated receptor 1, heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), and the EGF receptor revealed that pro-HB-EGF is significantly up-regulated upon thrombin stimulation. The kinetic of HB-EGF expression closely matched that of the second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Because inhibition of matrix metalloproteases or of the EGF receptor strongly attenuated the late phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, the second phase of ERK1/2 activation is primarily relayed by shedding of EGF receptor ligands. The small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of HB-EGF expression confirmed an important role of HB-EGF expression in triggering the second phase of ERK1/2 activation. Confocal imaging of a yellow fluorescent protein-tagged HB-EGF construct demonstrates the rapid plasma membrane integration of the newly synthesized protein.

In certain diseased states, however, VSM cells can undergo a phenotypic modulation toward a proliferative and secretory phenotype or by reverting toward the nonproliferative contractile phenotype (1Owens G.K.

Under these conditions, the VSM cell phenotype is reminiscent of that observed during vascular development, where VSM cells play a key role in morphogenesis of the blood vessel and exhibit a high proliferative index, migrate, and produce extracellular matrix components (6Hungerford J.E.

Under these conditions, VSM cells are exposed to various stimuli, including macrophage- and lymphocyte-derived cytokines and serum components that are currently being discussed as critical regulators of plaque stability. On the molecular level, phenotypic modulation of VSM cells depends on the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (8Roy J. Kazi M. Hedin U. Thyberg J. Differentiation. 2001; 67: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is transactivated after G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation and recruits the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Sos) through adaptor proteins, Shc and Grb2, thereby initiating the canonical Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade (9Eguchi S.

Within the family of EGF receptor ligands, heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) has been implicated in vascular remodeling because it is a potent mitogen, acts as a chemotactic factor for VSM cells, and is abundantly expressed in vascular lesions such as atherosclerosis (12Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Upon membrane insertion and signal peptide cleavage, pro-HB-EGF is synthesized as a type 1 transmembrane protein that is trafficked to the plasma membrane and proteolytically shed by matrix metalloprotease to release the biologically active soluble HB-EGF (13Miyamoto S. Yagi H. Yotsumoto F. Kawarabayashi T. Mekada E. Cancer Sci. 2006; 97: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 14Iwamoto R. Mekada E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, shedding of pro-HB-EGF also provides an important molecular link between GPCR activation and EGF receptor transactivation (15Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is involved in the control of both cell proliferation and differentiation (16Gerits N. Kostenko S. Moens U. Transgenic Res. 2007; 16: 281-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and different kinetic patterns have been shown to control the outcome (17Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). In thrombin-stimulated VSM cells, the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) induces a biphasic and long lasting activation of ERK1/2 and, subsequently, promotes the expression of contractile proteins and differentiation markers such as smooth muscle-specific α-actin and smooth muscle-specific myosin heavy chain (18Reusch H.P. Zimmermann S. Schaefer M. Paul M. Moelling K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33630-33637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although an EGF receptor transactivation and subsequent signal propagation through the Ras/Raf signaling module are required for the second and long lived phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in thrombin-stimulated VSM cells (19Reusch H.P. Schaefer M. Plum C. Schultz G. Paul M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19540-19547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the molecular basis of this differentiation-promoting signal cessation and reappearance has been unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an intermediate gene expression may underlie the delayed appearance of a second wave of ERK1/2 activation, and we provide evidence for a functionally relevant de novo expression of HB-EGF that contributes to the second phase of ERK1/2 activation and subsequent SM-α-actin expression in newborn rat aortic VSM cells. Reagents—The modulators brefeldin A, cytochalasin D, heparin, cycloheximide, and AG1478 were obtained from Sigma. Thrombin and GM6001 were from Calbiochem and Biomol, respectively. The thrombin receptor agonist peptide (FLLRN) was purchased from Biozol Diagnostica Vertrieb GmbH (Eching, Germany). The antibodies anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and anti-EGF receptor were purchased from Cell Signaling. The HB-EGF and amphiregulin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. AllStars negative control siRNA and a rat HB-EGF-specific siRNA (sense 5′-r(CGCUGGAUUUGAUGAGCUA)dTdT, antisense 5′-r(UAGCUCAUCAAAUCCAGCG)dTdG) were obtained from Qiagen. Cell Culture and Nucleofection of VSM Cells—Primary cultures of VSM cells from newborn rats were established and maintained as described previously (20Ives H.E. Schultz G.S. Galardy R.E. Jamieson J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 1400-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Growth arrest was induced in a serum-free quiescent medium (QM) containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma) instead of serum. Unless otherwise stated, cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 36 h prior to agonist application. For nucleofection, 2 × 106 VSM cells were supplemented with 100 nm siRNA and 100 μl of the nucleofection solution 4837 for rat VSM cells. After nucleofection with program T-28 (Amaxa Nucleofector), VSM cells were plated immediately. Cells were grown in the presence of 10% serum for 24 h and then starved for 36 h prior to agonist stimulation. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed into a buffer containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 63.3 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8. Samples were briefly sonicated to reduce the viscosity and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in a transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris base, 0.2 m glycine, and 20% ethanol. Blots were probed with respective primary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For densitometry, signal intensity was detected by a “cooled CCD camera.” Integrated band intensities were background-corrected and evaluated in a TINA 2.09 software (Raytest). Statistical significance was calculated using a Student's unpaired t test (comparison of band intensities with and without modulators) or a paired t test (comparison of stimulated samples to basal signal intensities). Significance was accepted at p < 0.05 (*) or p < 0.01 (**). RNA Extraction and Multiplex Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reversely transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and a (dT)18 primer. The PCR primers were selected based on published gene sequences for Rattus norvegicus HB-EGF (GenBank™ accession number NM_012945), PAR1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_012950), EGF receptor (GenBank™ accession number NM_031507), and GAPDH (GenBank™ accession number NM_017008). A 605-nucleotide (nt) fragment of the HB-EGF transcript was amplified using a sense 5′-GCT GCC GTC GGT GGT GCT GAA-3′ and antisense 5′-GCC ATG CCC AAC TTC ACT TTC T-3′ primer pair. A 354-nt PAR1 fragment was amplified using a sense 5′-CCT ATG AGA CAG CCA GAA TC-3′ and antisense 5′-GCT TCT TGA CCT TCA TCC G-3′ primer pair. A 439-nt EGF receptor fragment was amplified using a sense 5′-GGG AGC TGC CGT GTC AAA GA-3′ and antisense 5′-GGT GCC ACC CGC AGG TAC T-3′ primer pair. A 541-nt fragment of GAPDH was coamplified as an internal control, using a sense 5′-TTA GCC CCC CTG GCC AAG G-3′ and antisense 5′-CTT ACT CCT TGG AGG CCA TG-3′ primer pair. The PCR amplicons were analyzed and stained on 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.002% ethidium bromide, and the quantitative analysis of signals was performed with a fluorescence imaging system (Fujifilm LAS-1000). Intensities were integrated, corrected for background signals, and evaluated with a TINA 2.09 software (Raytest). Preparation of Membrane Fractions—VSM cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and lysed into a hypotonic lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysates were passed six times through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged (12,000 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Confocal Microscopy—VSM cells were nucleofected with 7 μg of an expression plasmid encoding HB-EGF-YFP. One hour later, the cells were treated with 7 μm brefeldin A or 2 μm cytochalasin D, incubated for another 4 h, and visualized with an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Carl Zeiss) using an α-Plan-Fluar 100×/1.45 objective. YFP was excited at 488 nm and detected through a 505-nm long pass filter. All experiments were performed at room temperature in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 128 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Cloning of HB-EGF cDNA—Total RNA of VSM cells was reversely transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The coding sequence of HB-EGF was amplified by PCR (Expand HF; Roche Applied Science) using appropriate primers (forward, 5′-GCCACCATGAAGCTGCTGCCG; reverse, 5′-TCTAGACAGTGGGAGCTAGCCAT) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-HIS-TOPO (Invitrogen). An expression plasmid encoding HB-EGF C-terminally tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was generated by in-frame ligation of the HindIII/XbaI-digested HB-EGF open reading frame into the custom-made vector pcDNA3-YFP. Second Phase Signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK Pathway in Thrombin-stimulated VSM Cells Requires de Novo RNA and Protein Synthesis—Previous studies have shown that the thrombin-induced contractile protein expression in VSM cells requires a biphasic activation of members of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade (21Schauwienold D. Plum C. Helbing T. Voigt P. Bobbert T. Hoffmann D. Paul M. Reusch H.P. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To analyze whether both phases of activation depend on the phosphorylation of preexisting signaling molecules or whether de novo mRNA transcription and synthesis of proteins may be required, VSM cells were pretreated with actinomycin D (4 μm), an inhibitor of mRNA polymerase activity, prior to thrombin stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1A, actinomycin treatment (4 μm added 30 min prior to thrombin stimulation) completely abolished the second phase of MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas the early phase of thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation remained unaffected. Similar results were obtained when VSM cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (10 μm, for 30 min), an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis (see Fig. 1B). We conclude that constitutive or thrombin-induced gene expression and protein synthesis are necessary for triggering a second, long lived phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which is associated with a subsequent expression of contractile proteins. Delayed ERK1/2 Phosphorylation Is Linked to Vesicular Transport—To delineate candidate proteins that are important for the thrombin-induced second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we tested whether cytoskeletal components and trafficking processes are involved. To this end, the actin polymerization was blocked with cytochalasin D (2 μm). Again, the initial thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was unaffected by this pretreatment, whereas the second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was almost completely abrogated (Fig. 2A). Because actin depolymerization may also affect the constitutive or agonist-triggered release of preformed secretory vesicles, possibly containing active matrix metalloproteinases that are important in the transactivation of the EGF receptor, we applied a more selective disruption of protein transport applying brefeldin A. Brefeldin A is an inhibitor of Sec7-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange of Arf GTPases and thereby blocks the assembly and loading of cargo to vesicles in the exocytic endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport, but also a subset of Arf-dependent internalization processes. In VSM cells treated with brefeldin A (7 μm added 30 min prior to thrombin stimulation), the second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but not the early ERK1/2 phosphorylation, was suppressed, indicating that either the synthesis and trafficking of a plasma membrane-resident or secretory protein or other Sec7/Arf-dependent pathways are a critical intermediate (Fig. 2, B and C). Expression of HB-EGF Is Up-regulated in Thrombin-stimulated VSM Cells—Candidate genes that are expressed upon thrombin stimulation in VSM cells and that are required for an EGF receptor transactivation and second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation include the receptor proteins PAR1 and EGF receptor as well as pro-HB-EGF. These proteins are cleaved and/or internalized and thus may require a constitutive or thrombin-induced replenishment. The gene expression of PAR1, of HB-EGF, and of EGF receptor was tested semi-quantitatively by a multiplex PCR applying nonsaturating numbers of amplification cycles and coamplification of the constitutively expressed GAPDH gene transcript as an internal control. Quantification of fluorescence intensities and normalization to the expression of GAPDH revealed that the transcription of HB-EGF was clearly induced upon thrombin stimulation in primary VSM cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The time course of HB-EGF expression showed a first significant increase in HB-EGF expression 30 min after thrombin stimulation and remained elevated for up to 3 h. Because the expression of the c-jun and c-fos immediate early genes was already induced 5–10 min after thrombin stimulation of VSM cells (data not shown), expression of HB-EGF is not part of the first wave of gene expression events. The expression of PAR1 did not change after thrombin stimulation, and expression of the EGF receptor was only slightly increased (statistically not significant). Western blot analysis of HB-EGF and EGF receptor expression in whole-cell lysates of thrombin-stimulated VSM cells confirmed these findings at the protein level (Fig. 3C). In the context of a preliminary genome-wide analysis of thrombin-regulated genes (Affymetrix rat genome 230 2.0 chip), we could confirm an approximate 4-fold increase in HB-EGF expression 120 min after agonist application compared with unstimulated VSM cells or to VSM cells that were exposed to thrombin for only 10 min (n = 2 each). Likewise, stimulation of VSM cells with a PAR1-selective activating peptide (TRAP, 25 μm) resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in HB-EGF expression, which was not sensitive to a pretreatment with pertussis toxin, indicating a critical role of the PAR1 subtype of protease-activated receptors and downstream signaling via pertussis toxin-insensitive heterotrimeric G proteins. Thus, we conclude that a PAR1-dependent HB-EGF up-regulation can be seen on both transcriptional and protein levels. Trafficking and Subcellular Localization of HB-EGF—To directly visualize the effects of cytochalasin D and brefeldin A on the subcellular localization of HB-EGF in living cells, VSM cells were nucleofected with a cDNA plasmid encoding a C-terminally YFP-tagged HB-EGF construct, seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and treated with the respective blockers 1 h upon nucleofection. The localization of the fluorescent HB-EGF fusion protein was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. In untreated VSM cells, the HB-EGF-YFP protein was efficiently trafficked to the plasma membrane as early as 5 h after nucleofection (Fig. 4A), which was the earliest time point at which the fluorescent protein was reliably detectable (probably because of the need for an autooxidation-dependent maturation of the YFP fluorochrome). In VSM cells that were treated with cytochalasin D (2 μm), the HB-EGF protein remained in intracellular vesicular structures (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of the secretory pathway by brefeldin A (7 μm) resulted in a localization of HB-EGF-YFP in a reticular compartment, including the nuclear membrane, presumably the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4C). Experiments in transiently transfected HEK293 fibroblasts essentially confirmed these results but demonstrated a less efficient integration of HB-EGF into the plasma membrane (data not shown). Thus, the disruption of the second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in thrombin-stimulated VSM cells by cytochalasin D or by brefeldin A may indeed reflect the inhibition of plasma membrane trafficking of HB-EGF. If de novo synthesis and membrane insertion would limit the EGF receptor transactivation and subsequent ERK1/2 phosphorylation, an initial depletion of HB-EGF should be followed by replenishment with newly synthesized protein. Indeed, if VSM cell membranes were obtained from thrombin-treated cells, an early loss of HB-EGF in membrane preparations was discernible (Fig. 4D). In the presence of brefeldin A, HB-EGF expression did not recover from this initial loss and remained low, indicating that disruption of ERK1/2 signaling by brefeldin A may be caused by a loss of cleavable HB-EGF in the plasma membrane. A Triple Membrane-passing Signaling Mechanism and EGF Receptor Transactivation Lead to the Delayed ERK1/2 Activation by TRAP Stimulation in VSM Cells—Upon GPCR stimulation, an MMP-mediated shedding of EGF receptor ligands leads to activation and autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor, resulting in the activation of the canonical Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To test whether the PAR1-induced second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation requires an MMP activity and EGF receptor transactivation, serum-starved cells were pretreated (30 min prior to TRAP stimulation) with different inhibitors as follows: the MMP inhibitor GM6001 (10 μm) or the EGF receptor-specific tyrphostin AG1478 (250 nm). Western blot analysis of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in whole-cell lysates revealed that, in the presence of GM6001, the late phase of ERK1/2 activation is almost blunted (Fig. 5A), whereas the first phase of ERK1/2 activation is attenuated by ∼50%. The same effect was observed in the presence of AG1478 (Fig. 5B). To support that the long lasting ERK1/2 phosphorylation depends on the shedding of newly synthesized HB-EGF, cells were treated with GM6001 or AG1478 only 30 min after TRAP stimulation. Under these conditions, the early phase was allowed to occur without inhibition. In both cases, the second phase of the ERK1/2 activation by TRAP stimulation was still suppressed, indicating that indeed a sustained shedding activity is required for triggering the delayed and long lasting PAR1-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in VSM cells. In addition, preincubation with a monoclonal antibody, which recognizes an epitope located within the ligand-binding site of the EGF receptor (151-IgG; 12 μg/ml), inhibited the first and second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (data not shown). ERK1/2 Phosphorylation Is Affected by Pharmacological and RNA Interference-mediated Modulation of HB-EGF—Immunoblot analysis of the thrombin-induced biphasic activation pattern of ERK1/2 demonstrated a clear inhibition by extracellular addition of heparin (100 μg/ml), which scavenges the released HB-EGF (Fig. 6, A and B). Because both the early and the delayed second phase of thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation were attenuated by heparin, we repeated the experiment but added heparin 30 min after thrombin stimulation. Again the second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was blocked by the delayed heparin treatment (Fig. 6, A and B), indicating that HB-EGF is indeed acting as a critical signal transducer during the delayed and long lasting phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To assess the role of HB-EGF in the ERK1/2 activation by an independent approach, VSM cells were nucleofected with siRNA directed against the 3-prime noncoding region of the rat HB-EGF transcript or with a nonsilencing control siRNA. After 2.5 days, the expression of HB-EGF was almost completely abolished by the HB-EGF-specific siRNA compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 6C). The expression of amphiregulin, another member of the EGF family that is endogenously expressed in VSM cells, remained constant after nucleofection of the HB-EGF or control siRNA. Assessing the ERK1/2 phosphorylation under the same conditions, we found a strong reduction in the thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon HB-EGF knockdown but not when the nonsilencing control siRNA was nucleofected (Fig. 6D). Previous studies revealed that upon PAR1 receptor activation, vascular smooth muscle cells undergo a phenotypic modulation toward a more differentiated phenotype. However, precise signaling pathways are still incomplete. Here we demonstrate that, upon thrombin stimulation, de novo expression of HB-EGF promotes the appearance of a long lasting second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in VSM cells. An up-regulation of the HB-EGF expression can be seen on both the RNA and the protein levels, reaching a maximum at about 1–2 h following thrombin stimulation. A functional implication of HB-EGF in the sustained ERK1/2 signaling is confirmed by pharmacological and RNA interference-based approaches. A sustained or biphasic activation pattern of ERK1/2 MAPKs is linked to cellular differentiation in several cell lines (cell biological settings), including growth factor binding to tyrosine kinase receptors such as the nerve growth factor-induced differentiation in PC-12 cells (17Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). Similarly, the principal mechanisms by which stimulation of a G protein-coupled receptor triggers a biphasic feed into the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade are only poorly understood. In thrombin-stimulated VSM cells, the biochemical processes that triggered the early and the delayed ERK1/2 phosphorylation seemed to be almost identical, presumably the triple membrane-spanning pathway, which has been worked out by Prenzel et al. (15Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). In VSM cells, both waves of thrombin- or TRAP-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation required an MMP-mediated shedding of heparin-sensitive EGF receptor ligands, EGF receptor autophosphorylation, and MEK1 activity. Thus, without an additional cellular plasticity, it seemed difficult to explain how the ERK1/2 activation vanishes and re-appears after about 1 h of delay. Possible mechanisms for the termination and reappearance of a signaling cascade on the time scale observed may include feedback loops that employ protein inactivation or degradation, trafficking of preformed proteins to the plasma membrane, or transcriptional regulation processes. Because transcriptional activity and protein translation were required for triggering the second phase of thrombin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (see Fig. 1), we concluded that de novo protein expression is a key intermediate of processes, which subsequently lead to a second and long lived ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Because PAR1 is coupled to the Gq, Gi, and G12/13 families of heterotrimeric G proteins (22Hirano K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), activation of multiple signal transduction pathways may drive numerous gene expression programs in VSM cells. Of these, immediate early genes that are activated in response to GPCR stimulation in VSM cells such as c-jun, c-fos, myc, or early growth response genes constitute the first wave of gene expression (23Rothman A. Wolner B. Button D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6399-6404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene products encoded by these ubiquitous genes have no direct effect on the GPCR-induced EGF receptor transactivation or the subsequent signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway (24Delaney J. Chiarello R. Villar D. Kandalam U. Castejon A.M. Clark M.A. Neurochem. Res. 2008; 33: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because in turn, both the onset and the peak of HB-EGF expression in thrombin-stimulated VSM cells are delayed compared with immediate early genes (23Rothman A. Wolner B. Button D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6399-6404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HB-EGF expression may be either regulated through gene products of immediate early genes or by independent mechanisms. c-Jun and c-Fos are part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex (25Eferl R. Wagner E.F. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar), which has been implicated in the mechanically activated HB-EGF expression in bladder smooth muscle cells (26Park J.M. Adam R.M. Peters C.A. Guthrie P.D. Sun Z. Klagsbrun M. Freeman M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C294-C301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, HB-EGF up-regulation in response to hyperosmotic stress or following chemotherapy involve the AP-1 complex (27Koh Y.H. Che W. Higashiyama S. Takahashi M. Miyamoto Y. Suzuki K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Wang F. Liu R. Lee S.W. Sloss C.M. Couget J. Cusack J.C. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2006-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These data imply that HB-EGF is part of the second wave of gene expression and may be regulated by transcriptional activity of the AP-1 complex. One should also mention that, besides transcriptional regulation, the abundance of HB-EGF mRNA may be controlled by mRNA stabilization (29Sorensen B.S. Ornskov D. Nexo E. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Other AP-1-independent mechanisms that regulate HB-EGF expression may include ETS (E26 transformation-specific sequence) transcription factors that bind to an overlapping AP-1/Ets site on the HB-EGF promoter (30McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.S. Garcia Ramirez J.J. Cherwinski H. Chen X.R. Klagsbrun M. Hauser C.A. Ostrowski M.C. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and are induced in VSM cells in response to various stimuli (31Oettgen P. Circ.

The appearance of a second phase of PAR1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was blocked by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of Sec7/Arf-dependent vesicular transport. Because the second phase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation starts at about 1 h after stimulation, the maturation and intracellular trafficking of this potential protein must thus proceed rather quickly. To investigate whether HB-EGF meets this requirement, we generated a YFP-tagged autofluorescent fusion construct and investigated the subcellular localization of HB-EGF in living VSM cells. An almost complete plasma membrane localization of the fusion protein was evident as early as 5 h after nucleofection, which was the earliest time point, after which the expression level and autooxidative maturation of the fluorescent protein allowed a confocal analysis. Because endomembrane compartments did not show a significant accumulation of the protein, we conclude that HB-EGF can rapidly exit the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex to become inserted into the plasma membrane. The localization of nascent HB-EGF in endomembrane compartments or transport vesicles became only unmasked if the anterograde trafficking was blocked by cytochalasin D or brefeldin A. If investigated in HEK293 fibroblasts, the plasma membrane insertion of HB-EGF-YFP was less efficient than in primary cultures of VSM cells (data not shown), indicating a cell type specificity in the rapid anterograde trafficking of this protein. One might argue that preformed and intracellularly stored HB-EGF-bearing vesicles can be inserted into the plasma membrane in a secretion-coupling model. However, because brefeldin A blocks the export pathway at the transition between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex, the effective blockade of the late phase ERK1/2 phosphorylation by this compound proves the requirement of the whole export pathway. Previous studies suggest that release from the plasma membrane, nuclear import, and subsequent signaling through the cytosolic C terminus of cleaved HB-EGF may contribute to its signaling properties (39Nanba D. Mammoto A. Hashimoto K. Higashiyama S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In line with the assumption that transactivation of the EGF receptor critically depends on the expression and surface localization of HB-EGF, we find that the membrane-localized HB-EGF pool is rapidly depleted upon thrombin stimulation. In brefeldin A-treated cells, this depletion was further enhanced, and the subsequent replenishment was lacking, indicating that the induction of HB-EGF expression depends on an intact signaling via Sec7/Arf. Further work would be required to firmly establish whether the brefeldin-sensitivity is because of a block of the rapid forward trafficking of HB-EGF. The sustained feed into the canonical Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in newborn rat aortic VSM cells is associated with an increased expression of contractile proteins such as the smooth muscle-specific α-actin and myosin heavy chain (19Reusch H.P. Schaefer M. Plum C. Schultz G. Paul M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19540-19547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and thereby contributes to the cellular plasticity. It is tempting to speculate that the regulated expression and rapid processing of distinct membrane-bound proforms of receptor tyrosine kinases may contribute to both facets of the phenotypic modulation of VSM cells. This idea is supported by the finding that coincubation of human VSM cells with pro-atherogenic supernatants of activated macrophages induces the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (40Beauchamp M.C. Letendre E. Renier G. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5253-5260PubMed Google Scholar). The basic fibroblast growth factor-dependent FGFR-1 activation has been described to enhance the long lived ERK phosphorylation and the mitogenic effect of platelet-derived growth factor-BB stimulation in human arterial VSM cells. Taken together, the induced expression of growth factor receptor ligands is likely to modulate the long term outcome of a specific input signal by providing a sustained signaling strength via their cognate receptors. Thus, the EGF receptor transactivation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation are not only modulated by early gene expression but the rapid intracellular processing and plasma membrane targeting of growth factor receptor ligands may constitute a highly dynamic network, which contributes to the plasticity of VSM cells.
