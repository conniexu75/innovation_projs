https://openalex.org/W1992635995,"Experiments based on the use of polarized protons led to (i) delineation of the spin-orbit part of the optical-model potential and (ii) an improved unified description of the nucleon-nucleus interaction within the framework of the optical model. Data obtained by means of a six-parameter potential are correlated for essentially all complex nuclei and over an energy region ranging from several hundred thousand to several tens of millions of electron volts for the following observables: polarization produced by elastic scattering, differential cross sections for elastic scattering, and reaction and total cross sections. None of the parameters varies with nuclear species, and only one varies with energy."
