https://openalex.org/W2092299362,"High-resolution banding techniques for the study of human chromosomes have revealed that the malignant cells of most tumors analyzed have characteristic chromosomal defects. Translocations of the same chromosome segments with precise breakpoints occur in many leukemias and lymphomas, and a specific chromosome band is deleted in several carcinomas. Trisomy, or the occurrence of a particular chromosome in triplicate, is the only abnormality observed in a few neoplasias. It is proposed that chromosomal rearrangements play a central role in human neoplasia and may exert their effects through related genomic mechanisms. Thus, a translocation could serve to place an oncogene next to an activating DNA sequence, a deletion to eliminate an oncogene repressor, and trisomy to carry extra gene dosage."

Levels of receptor in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and frontal cerebral cortex declined over the age span studied (19 to 73 years). The decline in D2 receptor in males was different from that in females."
https://openalex.org/W2014113952,The activation of human peripheral blood leukocytes or murine splenocytes with interleukin-2 (IL-2) generated cells that were lytic in vitro for a variety of fresh tumor cells. The adoptive transfer of such lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells to mice with established pulmonary sarcoma metastases was highly effective in reducing the number (and size) of these tumor nodules when combined with repeated injections of recombinant IL-2. These findings provide a rationale for clinical trials of the infusion of human LAK cells generated with recombinant IL-2 as well as Phase I trials of the infusion of recombinant IL-2 systemically into humans.

https://openalex.org/W2081790950,"Cyclosporin A blocked production of the lymphokine interleukin 2 by activated T lymphocytes. In a human and a murine cell line this inhibition reflected an absence of interleukin 2 messenger RNA. Under conditions in which these cells are normally stimulated to secrete high levels of interleukin 2, they failed to do so in the presence of cyclosporin A. In both cell lines this failure was accompanied by an absence of interleukin 2 messenger accumulation."

https://openalex.org/W1564090547,"The regulation of Ca2+ transport by intracellular compartments was studied in digitonin-permeabilized human neutrophils, using a Ca2+-selective electrode. When incubated in a medium containing ATP and respiratory substrates, the cells lowered within 6 min the ambient [Ca2+] to a steady state of around 0.2 microM. A vesicular ATP-dependent and vanadate-sensitive non-mitochondrial pool maintained this low [Ca2+] level. In the absence of ATP, a higher Ca2+ steady state of 0.6 microM was seen, exhibiting the characteristics of a mitochondrial Ca2+ set point. Both pools were shown to act in concert to restore the previous ambient [Ca2+] following its elevation. Thus, the mitochondria participate with the other pool(s) in decreasing [Ca2+] to the submicromolar range whereas only the nonmitochondrial pool(s) lowers [Ca2+] to the basal level. The action of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) which has been inferred to mediate Ca2+ mobilization in a few cell types was studied. IP3 released (detectable within 2 s) Ca2+ accumulated in the ATP-dependent pool(s) but had no effect on the mitochondria. The response was transient and resulted in desensitization toward subsequent IP3 additions. Under experimental conditions in which the ATP-dependent Ca2+ influx was blocked, the addition of IP3 resulted in a very large Ca2+ release from nonmitochondrial pool. The results strongly suggest that IP3 is a second messenger mediating intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in human neutrophils. Furthermore, the nonmitochondrial pool appears to have independent influx and efflux pathways for Ca2+ transport, a Ca2+ ATPase (the influx component) and an IP3-sensitive efflux component activated during Ca2+ mobilization."

https://openalex.org/W1591570672,"Insulin stimulates phosphorylation of both alpha- and beta- subunits of its own receptor in a cell-free system. A solubilized lectin-purified preparation of insulin receptors from rat liver membranes was preincubated with or without insulin at 4 degrees C and labeled for 10 min with Mn[gamma- 32P]ATP; the receptor subunits were isolated by specific immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor antibodies, followed by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. In gels run under reduced conditions, two bands (Mr = 135,000 and 95,000) were selectively labeled. These correspond exactly to the position of the alpha- and beta-subunits of the insulin receptor. Labeling of the Mr = 95,000 band was approximately 5-fold that of the Mr = 135,000 band. No labeled bands were detected when identical samples were immunoprecipitated in control serum. Phosphorylation of the receptor subunits required the presence of the divalent cation Mn2+ or Co2+; other cations such as Mg2+, Cr3+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ were ineffective. [gamma- 32P]ATP served as the 32P donor, whereas [gamma- 32P]GTP was ineffective. Phosphorylation of both subunits was stimulated 4-6-fold after a 60-min exposure to 10(-7) M pork insulin. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation was half-maximal after 5 min of incubation with 10(-7) M insulin or after 18 h with 3 X 10(-10) M hormone. The enhanced phosphorylation was specific for insulin and its analogs; guinea pig insulin was about 2% as potent as pork insulin, whereas epidermal growth factor, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and glucagon, as well as cAMP, were ineffective. The rapidity and specificity of this reaction, as well as the presence of all necessary components in the plasma membrane, suggest that insulin-mediated receptor phosphorylation is one of the earliest biochemical steps following insulin binding."
https://openalex.org/W1592314518,"Mac-3 is a mouse macrophage differentiation antigen defined by a rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb),M3/84. The structure, biosynthesis, quantitative surface expression, and distribution of Mac-3 have been studied by radiolabeling and isolation with MAb-Sepharose, saturation binding, absorption, and immunofluorescence flow cytometry. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Mac-3 migrates as a diffuse band with average Mr = 110,000. Labeling of intact cells with 125I and accessibility to MAb show it is present at least in part on the cell surface. Saturation labeling with 125I-MAb shows 4.2 X 10(4) cell surface sites on thioglycollate medium-elicited peritoneal macrophages. [35S]Methionine and [3H]glucosamine incorporation into Mac-3 by purified macrophages show it is a glycoprotein synthesized by these cells. Absorption shows Mac-3 is strongest in macrophages, present in lower quantities in lung, liver, bone marrow, and spleen, and undetectable in thymus, lymph node, brain, and heart. Immunofluorescent flow cytometry shows surface expression on thioglycollate-elicited macrophages but not bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, or thymus cell suspensions. Similar amounts of Mac-3 are immunoprecipitated from resident macrophages or macrophages elicited by sterile inflammatory agents, intracellular parasites, or immunomodulators, but the average Mr of Mac-3 varies from 92,000 to 110,000. Mac-3 is synthesized from precursor(s) of Mr = 74,000 and 79,000, identical in the different macrophages. Processing into the mature molecule, which migrates in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a more diffuse band and varies in Mr among macrophage elicited by different agents and to a lesser degree between different preparations of the same type of macrophage, occurs in 15 to 30 min."
https://openalex.org/W1995986183,"To obtain further information about the ontogeny of the T-cell antigen/MHC receptor, a Ti beta subunit cDNA probe and heteroantisera specific for the Ti alpha and Ti beta subunits were utilized to characterize human T-lineage cells. Analysis of thymic tumors and normal thymocytes at both the DNA and protein levels demonstrates that Ti beta gene rearrangement is evident in stage II (T11+T6+T3-) and stage III (T11+T6-T3+), but not stage I (T11+T6-T3-) thymocytes. In contrast, surface expression of Ti alpha and Ti beta molecules is exclusively restricted to stage III thymocytes. Thus human T-lineage ontogeny is characterized by an orderly series of differentiation steps wherein Ti beta gene rearrangement precedes surface expression of the T3-Ti molecular complex."

https://openalex.org/W2016850454,"The humoral immune response of the mouse to certain antigens is characterized by the dominant expression of a single or limited number of related, immunoglobulin variable region (V) structures by antibody-secreting lymphocytes. Such dominance could be due to preferred expression of these V regions in the B cell population prior to the immune response or could result from the action of selective or regulatory mechanisms during the immune response. Expression of a heavy chain variable region (VH) gene segment that partially encodes a V region structure that dominates the immune response to para-azophenylarsonate (Ars) in strain A mice was examined in the B cell population of Ars nonimmune mice. This VH gene segment participates in encoding several hundred thousand different V region structures expressed in this B cell population. The immune system is therefore capable of recurrently selecting a single V region structure from such a repertoire for dominant expression by antibody-secreting lymphocytes during an immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1561143991,"Polyclonal antibodies to calf thymus RNA polymerase II were raised in laying hens. Up to 75 mg of immunoglobulin/egg yolk were extracted by the polyethylene glycol procedure of Roeder (Roeder, R.G. (1976) in RNA Polymerase (Losick, R., and Chamberlin, M., eds) pp. 285-330, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The concentration of specific antibody in egg yolks (IgY) was comparable to that of serum as measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Purified antibody was shown to be directed against enzyme by removal of enzyme activity in immune complexes precipitated by rabbit anti-chicken IgY. The antibodies recognized several of the subunits of the enzyme as determined by their reactivity with polypeptides transferred to nitrocellulose paper after gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Production of antibodies in laying hens may facilitate the study of other highly conserved antigens that are poorly immunogenic in mammalian hosts."
https://openalex.org/W1546977432,"When KB cells labeled with 51Cr (1 muCi/ml) were treated with adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) at pH 6, 51Cr was released in a concentration-dependent manner with half-maximal release at 1 microgram/ml of virus. The 51Cr release was maximum at 10 micrograms/ml and represented nearly 20% of cell-associated 51Cr. 51Cr release depended on the length of incubation with Ad2 and the pH of the medium; maximum release was at pH 6 with very little release at pH 7.5. An antiserum against the penton base of Ad2 specifically neutralized the ability of Ad2 to release 51Cr. Chloroquine up to 200 microM did not block Ad2-dependent 51Cr release. DEAE-dextran stimulated Ad2-dependent 51Cr release; 4-5-fold stimulation was observed at 50 micrograms/ml of DEAE-dextran. We have compared the ability of Ad2 to release 51Cr with its ability to disrupt endocytic vesicles. Vesicle disruption was independent of pH of the medium in the range of pH 6 to 7.5 and was blocked by chloroquine, whereas, 51Cr release was much greater at pH 6 than at pH 7.5 and was not affected by chloroquine. These results suggest that Ad2 possess a lytic activity which ordinarily lyses acidic endocytic vesicles but, if the cells are maintained at acidic pH, can also directly disrupt the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1487925140,"The binding of C4b to C4b-binding protein (C4BP) was demonstrated at physiological ionic strength by analytical ultracentrifugation. The sedimentation rate of C4BP gradually increased from 9.4 S to a maximum of 18.5 S with increasing C4b concentration. The stoichiometry of different C4BP X C4b complexes was calculated from the sedimentation-velocity data. A linear relationship was established between the number of C4b bound per C4BP and the sedimentation rate of the complex. In order to define further the C4BP-C4b interaction, sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation was also used. Trace amounts of 125I-C4BP were centrifuged through 12 sucrose density gradients, each of which contained a different concentration of C4b throughout the gradient. The sedimentation rate of the C4BP increased with increasing C4b input to a maximum of 19.5 S. These binding data, in conjunction with the stoichiometry measurements determined in the analytical ultracentrifuge, were analyzed by the methods of Scatchard and Hill. At physiological ionic strength, C4BP exhibited four binding sites for C4b, each having an association constant of 1.2 X 10(7) M-1. A Hill coefficient of 1.1 was calculated, indicating that the four binding sites were independent. At reduced ionic strength, two additional sites were detected. The sedimentation coefficient of C4BP(C4b)6 was 24 S. The hydrodynamic data suggest that after four C4b molecules have bound to C4BP, the binding of additional C4b is sterically hindered. This interpretation implies that all six binding sites on C4BP are identical. C4BP also bound C4(H2O) (the product resulting from spontaneous hydrolysis of the thiol ester bond in native C4) and weakly bound C4c, but had no measurable affinity for native C4 or C4d at physiological ionic strength. A low-affinity interaction between C3b and C4BP was also demonstrated in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The C4BP X C3b complex was specific because C4BP mediated the cleavage of C3b by Factor I to C3bi with concomitant dissociation of the complex."

https://openalex.org/W1565951975,"Covalent (E-P) and noncovalent (E X P) phosphoenzyme intermediates exist on the reaction path of alkaline phosphatase of Escherichia coli. Zn(II) and Cd(II) alkaline phosphatases both form E-P and E X P from inorganic phosphate. These intermediates show well separated 31P NMR resonances in slow chemical exchange with respect to each other and to unbound phosphate. The 31P signals of E X P of all forms of the 113Cd(II) enzyme are doublets (J = approximately 30 Hz) due to 113Cd-O-31P coupling. Heteronuclear decoupling shows the phosphate of E X P to be coordinated to the A site metal of the two metal ions, A and B, approximately 3.9 A apart at each catalytic center. The chemical shifts of E X P vary from approximately 4 ppm for the Zn(II) enzyme to 12.6-13.4 ppm for forms of the Cd(II) enzyme and indicate a major influence of the metal ions on the conformation around phosphorus. The phosphoryl group of E-P is not coordinated to either of the two metal ions at the active center as shown by the absence of 113Cd-O-31P coupling on the 31P signals of E-P formed by the 113Cd(II) enzymes. The chemical shift of E-P is not sensitive to metal ion species or stoichiometry and is 8-9 ppm for all forms of the Zn(II) and Cd(II) enzymes. The E-P in equilibrium E X P in equilibrium E + Pi equilibria are described by analogous pH functions for the Zn(II) and Cd(II) enzymes. At acid pH E-P predominates and is converted to E X P as the pH is raised, following a sigmoid pH profile. For the Zn(II) enzyme the midpoint of the E-P in equilibrium E X P equilibrium occurs at pH 5, while for the Cd(II)6 and Cd(II)2 enzymes the midpoints are pH 8.7 and 10, respectively. The ionization controlling the equilibrium between E-P and E X P may be that of a metal-bound H2O (-OH nucleophile) whose pKa will depend strongly on the hardness of the coordinating metal ion. For the Zn(II)4 enzyme one of 2 mol of E-P formed by the enzyme at acid pH dissociates readily at pH 7.5-8 where dissociation of E X P (Kd approximately equal to mM) is rate-limiting. Phosphate binds more tightly to the Cd(II) enzyme and 2 mol of phosphate remain bound until above pH 9 where E X P begins to dissociate at mM concentrations. The low Kd for E X P and the alkaline shift in the E-P in equilibrium E X P pH profile probably account for the slow turnover of the Cd(II) enzyme. Precise chemical shifts of the 113Cd and 31P NMR signals as well as the ratio of E-P/E X P at one active center of the dimer are altered by metal ion binding at the other active center indicating significant subunit-subunit interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1504558880,"The sequence of 5,839 nucleotides from the adenovirus 2 genome has been determined and includes the regions between coordinates 32-44% and 66-71%. These regions contain the coding sequences for the 52,55K polypeptide, polypeptide IIIa, penton base, and the N terminus of the 100K polypeptide. Several additional unidentified open reading frames are present, including examples which overlap identified reading frames on the complementary strand and on the same strand.

https://openalex.org/W1563942667,"The mechanism of action of the adenosine analog, neplanocin A (NPC), was investigated in human colon carcinoma cell line HT-29. Cell viability was reduced to 38 and 17% of control by 24-h exposure to 10(-5) and 10(-4) M NPC, respectively. Cytocidal activity was not affected by inhibition of adenosine deaminase with 2'-deoxycoformycin. Concomitant with decreased cell viability was the reduced incorporation of [14C]dThd and [3H]Leu, and to a lesser extent [3H]Urd, into acid-precipitable material. Labeling of rRNA and tRNA during drug treatment for 24 h with [methyl-3H]Met and [14C]Urd revealed that NPC primarily inhibited RNA methylation, and to a lesser extent, RNA synthesis. RNase T2 digests of total RNA indicated that base and 2'-O-methylation were inhibited to approximately the same degree. Metabolites of NPC were measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and it was found that the major drug metabolite was the drug analog of S-adenosylmethionine with little formation of the respective, S-adenosylhomocysteine metabolite. NPC was utilized to a very small degree for RNA synthesis where only 2 and 30 pmol of NPC/A260 were incorporated into rRNA and tRNA after 24-h exposure to 10(-5) and 10(-4) M NPC, respectively. These results indicate that NPC is metabolized to a metabolite of S-adenosylmethionine which is a poor methyl donor for RNA methyltransferases, and that the accompanying decrease in RNA methylation and protein synthesis appears to be related to its cytocidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1513812181,"Human renal dipeptidase has been concentrated from kidneys by homogenization, 1-butanol solubilization, and (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. Final purification was achieved by high-pressure liquid chromatography followed by affinity chromatography. The enzyme appeared to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and its molecular weight was estimated to be 220,000 by analytical high-pressure liquid chromatography. The molecular weight of human urinary dipeptidase was estimated by agarose gel filtration to be 218,000. Dissociation of human renal dipeptidase in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis produced a single polypeptide (Mr 59,000). These results suggest that the native enzyme contains four subunits of Mr 59,000. Analysis of the peptidase for zinc content gave 3.9 g atoms of zinc/mol of enzyme which supports the suggestion of a 4-subunit structure. Carbohydrate analyses of the purified human dipeptidase demonstrated that it was not a glycoprotein, a characteristic that distinguishes it from porcine and rat renal dipeptidase. beta-Lactamase activity of the purified human enzyme was demonstrated by measuring its activity against the two beta-lactam antibiotics, imipenem and SCH 29482. Kinetic analyses indicated that both antibiotics undergo enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis at rates which could produce inactivation of the antibiotics within the human kidney. The beta-lactamase inhibitor, cilastatin, demonstrated reversible competitive inhibition of the peptidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of both antibiotics with the same Ki of 0.7 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1541408157,"The heavy isotope density shift method, in combination with a procedure for labeling cell surface insulin receptors, was used to determine the rate of transit of receptor to the cell surface from their site of synthesis and to follow the net rate of receptor removal from the plasma membrane in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To label surface receptors, 125I-insulin was bound to cells at 4 degrees C and then covalently cross-linked to the receptors with disuccinimidyl suberate. The identity of the surface-labeled product as insulin receptor was established by immunoprecipitation with antireceptor antibody and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were shifted to medium containing heavy (greater than 95% 15N, 13C and 2H) amino acids. The rates of appearance of newly synthesized heavy receptor at the cell surface and the loss of previously synthesized light receptor from the cell surface were followed by resolving labeled heavy and light surface receptors in CsCl density gradients and quantitating labeled receptor subunits by gel electrophoresis. It was shown that 2.5-3.0 h are required for newly synthesized insulin receptor to reach and become functional in the plasma membrane. Insulin-induced down-regulation of cellular insulin receptor level had no effect on the time required for the newly synthesized receptors to reach the cell surface. Down-regulation, however, increased the first order rate constants for the inactivation of cell surface insulin receptors from 0.046 to 0.10 h-1. The fact that the rate constants for inactivation of cell surface and total cellular insulin receptors were identical in the up-regulated state (0.046 and 0.044 h-1, respectively) or in the down-regulated state (0.10 and 0.096 h-1, respectively) suggests that the rate-limiting step in the receptor inactivation pathway occurs at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2044951495,"T cells that are positively selected in ontogeny could give rise to somatic mutants with new reactivities. Hence, somatic generation of diversity via mutations could be a source of expansion for the T-cell repertoire. To test this idea we searched among the progenies of an EdαEdβ-specific T-cell hybridoma for mutant clones capable of recognizing MHC antigens of a different haplotype. We isolated clones in which the original reactivity to EdαEdβ diminished substantially or disappeared, while new specificities (for AbαAbβ and/or AkαAkβ) were detected. In both α and β subunits of receptors isolated from these T-hybrid clones, structural differences were observed using IEF, NEPHGE, and two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps. Thus changes in MHC specificity occurred via mutations affecting the T-cell receptor structure."
https://openalex.org/W1572436211,"Zn(II), Cd(II), Co(II) and Mg(II) binding to apoalkaline phosphatase of Escherichia coli and the relative stabilities of the resulting metalloenzyme complexes have been measured by equilibrium dialysis and metal exchange reactions using gamma-emitting isotopes of these metals. At millimolar concentrations of these metal ions the alkaline phosphatase dimer binds three pairs of metal ions (A, B, and C sites). One of these pairs dialyzes readily without detectable change in the structure or function of the enzyme (C site). Of the remaining two pairs, the binding affinity of both for Zn(II) and Cd(II) is increased by formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediates. Cd(II) is bound less tightly to both A and B sites than Zn(II), and at pH 6.5 Cd(II) is induced to bind to the B sites by formation of the phosphate complexes. Mg(II), 5-10 mM, competes successfully with the IIB metal ions for the second or lower affinity pair of binding sites (B sites), although Mg(II) is a relatively poor competitor on an equimolar basis, especially for Cd(II). Binding of metal ions to the apoenzyme appears to be a cooperative process involving conformational changes in the protein which are not readily reversible. The initial binding of a pair of Zn(II) or Cd(II) ions to the apoenzyme is characterized by equilibrium constants of 10(-5) to 10(-7) M for Zn(II) and 10(-4) to 10(-5) M for Cd(II). Following the cooperative binding of all three pairs of metal ions, however, re-establishment of equilibrium by dialysis indicates binding constants of less than 10(-8) M for Zn(II) and less than 10(-6) M for Cd(II) at the sites of greatest affinity (A sites). Binding of Mg(II) or Cd(II) to the B site, once the A site is occupied, increases the phosphorylation rate of the Cd(II) enzyme by 20-fold. In the presence of saturating concentrations of Mg(II) complete activity is restored to the apoenzyme by 2 Zn(II) ions. In the absence of Mg(II) as many as 6 Zn(II) ions may be required before complete restoration is achieved. Roles for the A and B site metal ions in the catalytic mechanism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1546544369,"Recently Hatahara and Seyer (Hatahara, T., and Seyer, J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta (1982) 716, 377-382) isolated a factor from fibrotic rat liver which stimulates collagen synthesis in cultured fibroblasts without affecting their rate of proliferation. To investigate the mechanism of fibrogenic factor-mediated enhancement of type I collagen synthesis, we quantitated the levels of mRNAs coding for pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains in rat dermal fibroblasts. Cell-free translation experiments revealed that the fibrogenic factor caused greater than 5-fold increase in the translatable levels of type I mRNAs. We also quantitated collagen mRNAs by techniques of Northern blotting of glyoxylated poly(A+) RNA followed by hybridization to nick-translated human cDNA clones containing the coding sequence of pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains. Furthermore, we investigated the relative rates of collagen mRNA transcription in the isolated nuclei of treated and control fibroblasts. Similar quantitation of beta-actin mRNA transcription, which remains unaffected by the treatment with fibrogenic factor, was used as an internal control. We demonstrate that the fibrogenic factor causes a 4-6-fold increase in the rate of transcription of pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) genes. Finally, we also show that the rate of intracellular degradation of collagen is not significantly altered in cells treated with fibrogenic factor. These results combined with data on cell-free translation strongly suggest that the increased accumulation of type I collagen mRNA in fibrogenic factor-treated fibroblasts is a consequence of enhanced rates of collagen mRNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1560956748,"Genomic DNA from six euplasmic wheat-barley addition lines and from the wheat and barley parents were analyzed for the presence of alpha-amylase gene sequences, using plasmid DNAs from two different alpha-amylase cDNA clones as hybridization probes. Barley-specific alpha-amylase gene sequences were detected only in addition lines 1 and 6 carrying barley chromosomes 1 and 6, respectively. One cDNA clone probe hybridized strongly to sequences on chromosome 6 but not to those on chromosome 1. The other cDNA clone probe preferentially hybridized to sequences on chromosome 1. It is concluded that structural genes for alpha-amylases are located on barley chromosomes 1 and 6. alpha-Amylase genes on the same chromosome appear to be closely related to one another but substantially different from those on the other chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1568041976,"113Cd NMR spectra of 113Cd(II)-substituted Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase have been recorded over a range of pH values, levels of metal site occupancy, and states of phosphorylation. Under all conditions resonances attributable to cadmium specifically bound at one or more of the three pairs of metal-binding sites (A, B, and C sites) are detected. By following changes in both the 113Cd and 31P NMR spectra of 113Cd(II)2 alkaline phosphatase during and after phosphorylation, it has been possible to assign the cadmium resonance that occurs between 140 and 170 ppm to Cd(II) bound to the A or catalytic site of the enzyme and the resonance occurring between 51 and 76 ppm to Cd(II) bound to B site, which from x-ray data is located 3.9 A from the A site. The kinetics of phosphorylation show that cadmium migration from the A site of one subunit to the B site of the second subunit follows and is a consequence of phosphate binding, thus precluding the migration as a sufficient explanation for half-of-the-sites reactivity. Rather, there is evidence for subunit-subunit interaction rendering the phosphate binding sites inequivalent. Although one metal ion, at A site, is sufficient for phosphate binding and phosphorylation, the presence of a second metal ion at B site greatly enhances the rate of phosphorylation. In the absence of phosphate, occupation of the lower affinity B and C sites produces exchange broadening of the cadmium resonances. Phosphorylation abolishes this exchange modulation. Magnesium at high concentration broadens the resonances to the point of undetectability. The chemical shift of 113Cd(II) in both A and B sites (but not C site) is different depending on the state of the bound phosphate (whether covalently or noncovalently bound) and gives separate resonances for each form. Care must be taken in attributing the initial distribution of cadmium or phosphate in the reconstituted enzyme to that of the equilibrium species in samples reconstituted from apoenzyme. Both 113Cd NMR and 31P NMR show that some conformational changes consequent to metal ion or phosphate binding require several days before the final equilibrium species is formed."
https://openalex.org/W2023219457,"A gene coding for the major histocompatibility antigen HLA-A2 was transferred into human HLA-A2 negative M1 cells and murine L cells. Following transfection, these cells expressed molecules at the cell surface that are biochemically indistinguishable from HLA-A2 antigens on the human cell line JY from which the HLA-A2 gene was isolated. The M1A2 cells were recognized and lysed by a cytolytic T-cell clone specific for HLA-A2. The transfected L cells which express HLA-A2 in association with human beta 2-microglobulin were not lysed by this T-cell clone. The specific cytolysis of M1A2 cells could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to HLA-A2, and monoclonal antibodies to T3, T8, and LFA-1 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These results suggest that killing by allospecific T cells requires HLA-A2 antigens as well as other species-specific structures on the target cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1571294936,"The product of the lon (capR or deg) gene in Escherichia coli is protease La, an ATP-dependent protease with a linked ATPase activity. Unlike most lon mutations, capR9 is dominant over the wild type under certain conditions. When protease La was isolated from R9 cells and from a recessive capR- strain using DEAE-cellulose chromatography, the mutant enzymes showed about 50% of the wild type activity. Unlike the wild type, the R9 and R- proteases were inhibited by addition of NaCl (less than 0.1 M). In addition, the R9, but not the R-, material inhibited protelysis by normal protease La, and this effect may account for its dominant phenotype. When isolated by phosphocellulose chromatography, the R9 protein lost proteolytic activity but still inhibited the wild type enzyme. This inhibitory activity was purified to near homogeneity using DEAE-cellulose and heparin-agarose chromatography, and corresponded to the 94,000-dalton R9 gene product. At different concentrations, it inhibited ATP-dependent casein degradation and casein-stimulated ATP hydrolysis to a similar extent. Thus, rates of ATP and protein cleavage remained proportional. Similar inhibition of the wild type protease was observed in the presence of DNA which stimulates both protein and ATP hydrolysis. Half-maximal inhibition was observed with approximately a 1:1 ratio of the R9 to the wild type protein. The subunit sizes of the R9 and the wild type protease were indistinguishable but they differed in isoelectric points. Upon gel filtration, both eluted as tetramers (450,000 daltons) in the absence of salt. However, with 0.1 M NaCl, the wild type protease La remained as a tetramer, but the R9 protein dissociated into dimers and monomers and became a more effective inhibitor. After mixing with R9 protein, 3H-labeled protease La remained tetrameric, though it had lost activity. These findings suggest that tetramer formation between the wild type and defective R9 subunits is responsible for the inhibition of the proteolytic and ATPase activities."
https://openalex.org/W1592065593,"The O-linked oligosaccharides of the cloned, murine cytotoxic T cell line B6.1.SF.1 were compared with the corresponding oligosaccharides from a Vicia villosa lectin-resistant mutant of B6.1.SF.1 called VV6 (Conzelmann, A., Pink, R., Acuto, O., Mach, J.-P., Dolivo, S., and Nabholz, M. (1980) Eur. J. Immunol. 10, 860-868). The VV6 mutant cells are deficient in binding sites for this GalNAc-specific lectin. Cells were grown in the presence of [3H]glucosamine and [3H] galactose to label the glycoproteins, and the desialyzed, alkaline borohydride-released oligosaccharides were isolated and characterized. The VV6 cells contained a series of O-linked oligosaccharides ranging in size from a disaccharide to a pentasaccharide. These were composed of galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylhexosaminitol, the latter sugar being derived from the reducing terminus. The predominant oligosaccharide had the partial structure Gal beta GlcNAc beta-(Gal beta)N-acetylhexosaminitol. In contrast, the analogous oligosaccharides of the parental cells contained additional beta-linked GalNAc residues located at nonreducing termini. The smallest of these had the structure GalNAc beta 1,4Gal beta-N-acetylhexosaminitol. Neither cell line contained significant amounts of terminal GalNAc linked to Ser/Thr which is the main binding site for the V. villosa B4 lectin on Tn erythrocytes (Tollefsen, S. R., and Kornfeld, R. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5172-5176). These findings suggest that the major binding sites for the V. villosa lectin on the parental cytotoxic T cell line consist of structures containing beta 1,4-linked GalNAc residues at the nonreducing ends of conventional O-linked structures. The VV6 cells lack these beta-linked GalNAc residues, and this may account for their deficiency of V. villosa lectin-binding sites. In the following paper (Conzelmann, A., and Kornfeld, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12536-12542), we demonstrate that the VV6 cells are missing the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase that is responsible for the synthesis of these unusual oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1668156502,"We have examined the distribution of L-ascorbic acid in rat parotid acinar cells by analysis of whole tissue, subcellular fractions, and parotid salivary secretion. Acinar cell secretion granules contain reduced ascorbate at a calculated concentration of 3.5 mM. A distinct extragranular pool, comprising as much as 80% of total cellular ascorbate, also exists in these cells. Parotid secretion, collected from the cannulated duct after inducing secretion from acinar cells by isoproterenol administration, contains millimolar reduced ascorbate. Quantitatively, the level measured in parotid secretion, relative to the secreted enzyme alpha-amylase, is nearly identical to that measured in isolated granules, suggesting a common release by exocytosis. Although ascorbate has been extensively studied as a content component of adrenal chromaffin granules and has recently been implicated in secretion granules of other neural and endocrine tissues, its detection in secretion granules of exocrine cells is novel. Thus, ascorbate-dependent processes that occur in exocrine secretion granules, or that may be general to all types of secretion granules, are worthy of consideration."
https://openalex.org/W1518191877,"Golgi-apparatus membranes, isolated from mouse liver, pump protons inwards, when supplied with NADH or ATP. The acidification of Golgi-apparatus cisternae and vesicles was detected with neutral red, a permeant dye, as a difference in absorbance at 550 nm minus that at 600 nm. The maximum rates detected with NADH and ATP were between 0.0006-0.0009 and 0.0030-0.0050 delta OD units/mg of protein/min, respectively, at pH 7.5. The outside buffer used was a bovine serum albumin suspension. The acidification of Golgi apparatus was inhibited from 45 to 100% by ionophores and from 22 to 100% by uncouplers. The results implicate both ATP and a redox system coupled to NADH oxidation in the acidification of Golgi-apparatus membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1550114910,"epsilon-Amino groups of lysines of 30 S ribosomal subunits with affinity for phosphate groups were selectively modified in situ by reaction with pyridoxal phosphate and reduction of the Schiff base with nonradioactive or radioactive sodium borohydride. This reaction modified only a limited number of ribosomal proteins and resulted in the loss of only some 30 S activities. The modified proteins were identified and the extent of their modification determined. The main targets of the reaction were S3 greater than S1 greater than S6. The activity most severely affected by the pyridoxal phosphate reaction was mRNA-dependent aminoacyl-tRNA binding. Some inhibition of poly(U) binding was also observed, while neither binding of initiation factors nor association with 50 S subunits was inhibited. The inhibition of aminoacyl-tRNA binding showed distinct selectivity: the inhibition was far greater with NAcPhe-tRNA than with fMet-tRNA and with A site than with P site binding. In addition, initiation complex formation with some mRNAs (e.g. MS2 RNA) was affected more than with others (e.g. T7 early mRNA). Ribosome reconstitution experiments showed that the modification of protein S3 was the primary cause of the inhibition; a role was also played by ribosomal proteins S1, S2, and S21. Substrate protection experiments showed that the 30 S activity can be protected from pyridoxal phosphate inactivation upon formation of a ternary complex with poly(U) and tRNAPhe or NAcPhe-tRNAPhe. Accordingly, the extent of modification of ribosomal protein S3 was reduced in the ternary complex while modification of S1 was reduced in the presence of poly(U) alone."
https://openalex.org/W1988231893,An assay was developed to detect recombination events taking place in an in vitro reaction. Extracts of cultured mouse preB lymphocytes were found to catalyze homologous recombination between substrate DNA molecules but not site-specific recombination between cloned mouse immunoglobulin D and J genes. Addition of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates increased the frequency of homologous recombination. This recombination activity was not observed in two differentiated lymphocyte cell lines.
https://openalex.org/W1561102548,"A phospholipid transfer protein has been purified 280-fold from Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides when compared to the 40-70% ammonium sulfate fraction derived from the crude cell supernatant in which the activity was originally found (Cohen, L.K., Lueking, D.R., and Kaplan, S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 721-728). When compared to the crude cell lysate, the activity has been purified approximately 1,400-fold with a recovery of 12.5%. The active protein is a monomer with a molecular weight of 26,500, as estimated by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium, and 27,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein can transfer all phospholipid species tested with the order of efficiency of transfer being phosphatidylglycerol greater than phosphatidylcholine greater than phosphatidylethanolamine."
https://openalex.org/W1504142745,"The amino acid sequence of the enzyme cyanase (cyanate hydrolase) from Escherichia coli has been determined by automatic Edman degradation of the intact protein and of its component peptides. The primary peptides used in the sequencing were produced by cyanogen bromide cleavage at the methionine residues, yielding 4 peptides plus free homoserine from the NH2-terminal methionine, and by trypsin cleavage at the 7 arginine residues after acetylation of the lysines. Secondary peptides required for overlaps and COOH-terminal sequences were produced by chymotrypsin or clostripain cleavage of some of the larger peptides. The complete sequence of the cyanase subunit consists of 156 amino acid residues (Mr 16,350). Based on the observation that the cysteine-containing peptide is obtained as a disulfide-linked dimer, it is proposed that the covalent structure of cyanase is made up of two subunits linked by a disulfide bond between the single cystine residue in each subunit. The native enzyme (Mr 150,000) then appears to be a complex of four or five such subunit dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1486158713,"The MB40.3 monoclonal antibody binds to four distinct HLA-B molecules; B7, B40, B40*, and B27. With Fab' fragments only the interaction with B7 and B40 was detected and the affinity for both was the same (1-2 X 10(8) M-1) suggesting the epitope is shared by the two molecules. Unlike many antibodies for which low affinity is due to a high-dissociation constant, that of MB40.3 results from a very low-association rate constant, coupled with a low-dissociation constant. In consequence, the affinity and avidity of Fab', F(ab')2, and IgG for B7 and B40 were found to be of a similar magnitude, soluble B7 was a more efficient competitor for antibody than cell surface B7 and in practice antibody bivalency was of little importance. The forward rate constant could be increased by removing Fc from the antibody or by removing sialic acid from the cells by treatment with neuraminidase. The neuraminidase treatment also produced an increase in the number of detectable cell surface HLA-A,B molecules. The affinity of MB40.3 for B40* and B27 was estimated to be less than 4 X 10(6) as no binding with Fab' was detected due to a high-dissociation rate. For these two HLA-B molecules bivalent attachment was critical, and it increased the strength of interaction with cell surface B40* and B27 to a point where the avidities were comparable to those obtained with B7 and B40, with B40* interacting more strongly than B27. The epitopes recognized by MB40.3 on B40* and B27 were thus shown to be structurally different from each other and from those on B7 and B40. The properties of this antibody contrast with those of other anti-HLA-A,B we have studied (Ways, J.P., and Parham, P. (1983) Biochem. J. 216, 423-432)."
https://openalex.org/W1575071140,"Late in adenovirus infection, a virus-encoded protease processes several viral structural proteins. The maturation cleavages are a prerequisite for full viral infectivity. The peptide fragment removed during processing is located at the amino end of the major core protein VII. The structure of the precursor peptide sequence was determined by both protein and nucleotide sequencing. Two processing events were elucidated. First, during protein biosynthesis, the initiator methionyl residue is removed and the penultimate seryl residue is acetylated. Second, the resulting NH2-terminal 23-residue fragment is removed during virus assembly. The specificity of the viral endoprotease was investigated by isolating and characterizing another viral proprotein precursor, Pro-VI. The propeptide of VI was also found to be extended at the amino end of the molecule. Comparison of the two propeptide sequences at the cleavage site revealed a consensus amino acid sequence of Gly-Gly-Ala. In addition, there is extensive similarity in the precursor sequences of both proteins. The analogous constitution of the precursor fragments in Pro-VI and Pro-VII suggests that a common mechanism is implicated in controlling the reorganization of VI and VII during virion assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1521714920,"The effect of altered lipid A synthesis on the synthesis of the OmpA protein was investigated in mutants of Salmonella typhimurium possessing a temperature-sensitive defect in 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate) synthesis. The defect is due to a mutation in the structural gene for 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthetase (designated kdsA), and expression of this lesion results in the accumulation of an incomplete precursor of lipid A (Rick, P.D., and Osborn, M.J. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 4895-4903). Pulse labeling studies revealed a pronounced transient increase in the rate of OmpA synthesis following a shift of mutants to nonpermissive conditions. The rate of OmpA synthesis increased about 2.5-fold at 20-30 min following a shift to 42 degrees C and then decreased over the next 30-40 min. A similar but less pronounced increase in the apparent rate of synthesis of the 34-kilodalton porin protein was also observed. In contrast, the rates of synthesis of total cell envelope protein, as well as that of the 35 and 36-kilodalton porin proteins, were relatively unaffected. The effect of increased temperature on the rate of OmpA synthesis was specifically related to expression of the kdsA lesion; it was not found to be strain-specific or uniquely related to expression of a single kdsA mutant allele."
