https://openalex.org/W2073703618,"Increasing concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, and molecular oxygen enhanced production of nitrous oxide relative to molecular nitrogen during denitrification in soils. Soil acidity interacted with nitrate to increase the ratio of nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen. In response to anoxic conditions, nitrous oxide production initially increased but nitrous oxide was then consumed, a pattern which resulted from the sequential synthesis of nitrogenous oxide reductases."
https://openalex.org/W2072940478,"The Pioneer 11 results for Saturn's large heat output, small magnetic field, and near-axisymmetry of the field may all be explained by an interior model in which the helium is undergoing phase separation and is nonuniformly distributed. Substantial depletion of helium from the atmosphere is predicted."
https://openalex.org/W1999135588,"We have used the high optical absorptivity of urban and source particulates to trace their ""graphitic"" component. The optical absorptivity and the particulate carbon loading show a strong correlation. Analyses of the data indicate that primary soot emissions compose a major fraction of the carbonaceous aerosol and put a low limit on secondary organic material produced in correlation with the ozone concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2083086702,"New faunal and stratigraphic evidence documents the validity of the North American Clarkforkian Land-Mammal Age. Its limits are defined by the initial appearances of immigrant taxa. In the type area (northwestern Wyoming), the Clarkforkian is subdivided into three zones. Clarkforkian faunas are approximately correlative with latest Paleocene-earliest Eocene faunas of the Paris Basin of Europe and in part with the Gashato-Naran Bulak faunas of Mongolia."
https://openalex.org/W2012486552,"During retorting of oil shales in the western United States, carbonate minerals are calcined, releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide. Residual organic matter in the shales may also be burned, adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The amount of carbon dioxide produced depends on the retort process and the grade and mineralogy of the shale. Preliminary calculations suggest that retorting of oil shales from the Green River Formation and burning of the product oil could release one and one-half to five times more carbon dioxide than burning of conventional oil to obtain the same amount of usable energy. The largest carbon dioxide releases are associated with retorting processes that operate at temperatures greater than about 600 degrees C."
