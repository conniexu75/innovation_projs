https://openalex.org/W1596914691,"Abstract Twenty-seven tryptic peptides were isolated from the A1 protein from bovine spinal cord. These, together with 16 peptic peptides, were utilized to establish the complete amino acid sequence of the 170 residues of the A1 protein. Peptide T, derived from the A1 protein by cleavage of the carboxyl of the single tryptophan residue, was useful in positioning the peptides which comprise the COOH-terminal end. Seven chymotryptic and nine tryptic peptides were isolated from Peptide T. An unusual feature of the sequence is the methylated arginine residue at position 107 which is present as both the dimethyl and monomethyl derivatives. The methylated derivatives appear to be relatively resistant to tryptic hydrolysis. Located close to the methylated arginine residue is a Pro-Arg-Thr-Pro-Pro-Pro sequence, a structure which may induce a sharp bend in the molecule, suggesting a conformation more compatible with an open double chain structure than a random coil. The over-all sequence reveals no obvious periodicity but rather a general distribution of basic residues over the polypeptide chain, making the interaction with phospholipids within the myelin matrix highly probable. Several peptide segments of 9 residues exist, in which basic residues are missing; the somewhat nonpolar character of these regions suggests a possiblity for participation in nonpolar interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1499182986,"We have studied histones from a wide range of vertebrates with high resolution electrophoresis. There are five major electrophoretic fractions of histone in all somatic tissues in all species examined. Two fractions of histone have a constant electrophoretic mobility no matter what their source. Two fractions vary somewhat from class to class of vertebrate; and one fraction, the lysine-rich fraction, varies considerably in mobility, indicating substantial changes in its primary structure during evolution. This interpretation is confirmed by separation of the individual histone fractions and amino acid analysis. Electrophoretic heterogeneity is found within several of these fractions in good agreement with previous reports on calf histones (Panyim and Chalkley, Biochemistry 8, 3972 (1969)). The electrophoretic heterogeneity within Fractions F2al and F3 is manifested by bands which, while varying in relative intensity from species to species, nonetheless always have a constant mobility. On the other hand the extent of the electrophoretic heterogeneity of the lysine-rich histone group varies among species indicative of a much less stringent demand for a constancy of primary sequence of these molecules relative to the more arginine-rich histone molecules."

https://openalex.org/W1571541323,"Abstract Oxygen equilibria have been used to study the interaction between red cell organic phosphates, magnesium ion, and hemoglobin. We measured the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin solutions containing either 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) or ATP and varying concentrations of magnesium ion at 10°, 20°, and 30°. Deoxyhemoglobin and Mg2+ were competitors, binding reciprocally with the organic phosphates. Stability constants derived from these data were in the order: HbDPG g HbATP g MgATP g MgDPG. The binding of deoxyhemoglobin to 2,3-DPG was more temperature dependent than its binding to ATP (ΔH = -11 kcal per mole and -6.1 kcal per mole respectively). Unlike MgATP, the binding of magnesium ion to 2,3-DPG was independent of temperature. From these equilibria and a knowledge of the total red cell concentration of magnesium, ATP, 2,3-DPG, and hemoglobin, we have estimated the distribution of bound and unbound molecules within oxygenated and deoxygenated erythrocytes under physiological conditions. The bulk of red cell ATP is bound to magnesium and therefore is ineffective in mediating hemoglobin function. Upon deoxygenation there is a considerable increase in the concentration of free magnesium ion."

https://openalex.org/W1480282387,"Abstract To elucidate the possible role of N-acetyl-l-glutamate known as the natural activator of the ammonia-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase in regulation of urea biosynthesis, studies were undertaken on mouse and rat. 1. Acetylglutamate was found to occur in livers of mouse and rat at a level of about 30 nmoles per g of tissue. Of the other abdominal organs of mouse tested, the compound was detected in the small intestine at a level of about 10 nmoles per g of tissue but practically none was found in kidney, spleen, and heart. It was further shown that the compound is localized in the mitochondrial fraction in liver cells. The intramitochondrial concentration of acetylglutamate is estimated to be of the order of 10-4 m, which is close to the activation constant of the carbamyl phosphate synthetase for the compound. The tissue distribution and the subcellular localization of acetylglutamate approximately coincide with those of the enzyme thus far reported. 2. The acetylglutamate content in mouse liver increased from 15 to 40 nmoles per g of tissue in response to the increment of dietary protein content from 0 to 60% and a positive correlation was observed between the changes in acetylglutamate and urea content in liver. 3. The biosynthesis of acetylglutamate in mouse and rat tissues was shown both in vivo and in vitro with [14C]glutamate or [14C]acetate as tracer. Combined use of Dowex 1 column chromatography and paper chromatography permitted a complete separation of acetyl[14C]glutamate from other radioactive products formed from the labeled precursors. The experiments in vivo on acetylglutamate synthesis in mouse liver showed that the compound is subject to metabolic turnover with a half-life of a few hours. In experiments in vitro the synthetic activity was shown in liver slices and sectioned small intestine but not in slices of kidney and spleen. Of the activity in liver homogenate, a major part was recovered in the mitochondrial fraction. The localization of the activity coincided with that of acetylglutamate as observed. 4. The mitochondrial synthesis of acetylglutamate required the presence of both glutamate and acetate (or pyruvate) as substrates. The apparent Km for glutamate was estimated to be 1 mm or less and the maximal synthetic rate obtained at a saturating concentration of glutamate was about 7 nmoles per g of tissue per hour. It is suggested that the intracellular concentration of glutamate may be a critical factor which can affect the tissue level of acetylglutamate. The results are consistent with and support the postulated role of acetylglutamate in the regulation of urea biosynthesis mediated through its activating effect on carbamyl phosphate synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1573331976,"Abstract The effects of several divalent cations, ATP, F-, and epinephrine, on adenyl cyclase from cardiac tissue were examined. Mn++ was more effective than Mg++ in activating the enzyme and the apparent Ka for Mn++ (0.7 mm) was less than that for Mg++ (2 to 3 mm). Co++ produced weaker stimulation than Mg++. ATP concentrations in excess of divalent metal ion inhibited the cardiac enzyme. F- increased the velocity of the reaction at all Mg++ concentrations, even those above saturation. It was concluded that the stimulatory effect of F- was due to an increase in Vmax, there being no significant effect on the Km for substrate (MgATP) or on the apparent Ka for Mg++. Epinephrine, like F-, stimulated the cardiac enzyme at all Mg++ concentrations and did not prominently affect the apparent Ka for Mg++ or the Km for the MgATP substrate. The actions of F- and epinephrine on the enzyme in washed particles of brain and of F- and glucagon on particulate preparations of liver were also examined. In each case the prominent effect of F- and hormone was to increase reaction velocity. It is suggested that a common feature of hormonal (and F-) stimulation of adenyl cyclase may be an increase in Vmax of the enzyme, reflecting increased reactivity of the catalytic site with substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2164073810,"Abstract The amino acid composition of native bovine neurophysins I and II, isolated by 0.1 n HCl extraction of acetone-desiccated posterior pituitary glands, has been contrasted with that of neurophysins isolated under conditions of lesser acidity. The results indicate that one of the principal fractions isolated under the latter condition represents neurophysin II from which the amino-terminal Ala-Met peptide has been removed by proteolytic digestion. The previously shown ability of this fraction to bind oxytocin and vasopressin indicates that residues 1 and 2 of neurophysin II, which include its single methionine residue, are nonessential to hormone-binding. Molecular weight studies of neurophysins I and II indicate that they are heterogeneous with respect to molecular weight and that neurophysin II is a mixture of monomer and dimer under the conditions studied. Circular dichroism studies indicate that the conformations of neurophysins I and II are similar and suggest almost no α-helical content. H+ ion titration studies indicate that all ionizable side chains in neurophysin II, in addition to the single histidine of neurophysin I, are freely available to solvent. Changes in proton equilibria and circular dichroism accompanying neurophysin-hormone interaction have been used to study the interaction of neurophysin with a series of peptides containing sequences related to those at positions 1 to 3 of oxytocin and vasopressin. The results indicate that the principal qualitative features of neurophysin-hormone interaction are preserved in its interaction with peptides containing only the first 3 residues of the hormones. In addition, the following relative binding affinities to neurophysin were observed: l-cystinyl-bis-l-tyrosine amide, l-methionyl-l-tyrosyl-l-phenylalanine amide g S-methyl-l-cysteinyl-l-tyrosyl-l-phenylalanine amide g l-alanyl-l-tyrosyl-l-phenylalanine amide g glycyl-l-tyrosyl-l-phenylalanine amide. These data indicate that, together with the hormone α-NH2 and its side chains in positions 2 and 3, the side chain attached to the α-carbon at position 1 plays an important role in binding to neurophysin. This finding is tentatively interpreted in terms of a model in which water is excluded from the binding site upon interaction. H+ ion titration studies confirm previous conclusions from optical activity studies that high concentrations of calcium ion do not significantly diminish the interaction of the hormones with bovine neurophysin. These results differ from the reported effect of calcium ion on porcine neurophysin-hormone interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1555602167,"Abstract Previous work has established that rat liver contains several closely related forms of β-glucuronidase differing in their subcellular distribution. The present report focuses on the most abundant form, which is the major one occurring in lysosomes. This β-glucuronidase was purified 8,400-fold, to the highest specific activity thus far reported. The preparation is homogeneous by all criteria applied. It contains a relatively high content of glutamic and aspartic acids and a very low content of sulfur-containing amino acids. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 280,000, the value obtained depending upon the method used for the determination. Since gel filtration in the presence of urea, or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions, yielded results suggesting that the enzyme consists of subunits of molecular weight of approximately 75,000, the native enzyme apparently is a tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1529131417,"Abstract 1. The major classes of neutral lipids and the phospholipids were determined in sarcolemma, fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria of rat skeletal muscle. 2. The lipid composition of the sarcolemma is clearly different from that of sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The sarcolemma contains a high content of phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin in the phospholipid as well as large amounts of cholesterol, cholesterol ester and fatty acids in the neutral lipid fraction. 3. The fatty acid content of the neutral lipids is high in 16:0 + 18:0 and is less unsaturated than that of mitochondria or fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum, which are very similar. Each of the cell fractions shows a distinct fatty acid pattern in the phospholipid fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1590742034,"Abstract The circular dichroic spectrum of homogeneous concanavalin A shows changes in the near ultraviolet upon specific binding of α-methyl-d-mannoside. The far ultraviolet spectrum shows no evidence of α helical structure but most closely resembles the spectrum of the model for type II-β structure, poly-S-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine. Both the far and near ultraviolet spectra show drastic and irreversible changes above pH 9. The data suggest that sugar binding at physiological pH is accompanied by a conformational change which may be important in the unique biological activities of this lectin."

https://openalex.org/W1531089468,"Abstract A galactosyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of galactocerebrosides (galactosylceramide) containing α-hydroxy fatty acids linked to the amino group of the sphingosine moiety has been isolated from 19- to 20-day-old embryonic chicken brain. The enzyme catalyzes the following reaction: UDP-galactose-14C + ceramide → 14C-galactocerebroside (+ UDP) Several ceramides (N-acylsphingosines) were tested as galactose acceptors, including those containing C16 and C18 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, but the only active ceramide preparation was one containing a mixture of the α-hydroxy fatty acids 2-hydroxy C18:0 (97%) and 2-hydroxy C18:1 (2%). The reaction was stimulated by Mg++, Mn++, and Ca++. UDP-Galactose-14C could not be replaced by 14C-labeled galactose, galactose-1-P, or ADP-galactose; the Km values were 1.1 x 10-4 and 0.4 x 10-4 m for ceramide and UDP-galactose, respectively. The galactosyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of cerebroside is different from two other galactosyltransferases previously obtained from embryonic chicken brain, which are concerned with two steps in the synthesis of gangliosides. The UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase activity was low in homogenates of brains from young chick embryos; in the period between 15 and 20 days of embryonic development, there was a rapid increase in activity (per mg of protein). Maximal activity was detected in homogenates from 19- to 20-day-old embryos, and was 10- to 20-fold greater than the activity in young embryonic brain. The results are in accord with the suggestion that α-hydroxy fatty acid-containing cerebrosides are synthesized via the following pathway: sphingosine → ceramide → cerebroside."
https://openalex.org/W1591425165,"Abstract The product distributions of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens amylase acting on homologous maltodextrins have been measured and used to map the active site of the enzyme. These data can be used to estimate the energetics of subsite-monomer interactions on the enzyme. The resulting energy contour supplied the information needed to compute the population distribution of productive and nonproductive positional isomers for any set of enzyme-substrate complexes. These calculations lead to a theoretical dependence of the apparent Michaelis parameters, Ki, Km, and Vmax on chain length. The theoretical dependence of the enzyme parameters upon chain length predicted from the representational subsite model is in rather poor agreement with the experimental data. However, modification of the model by introduction of substrate-induced strain brings the computed and experimental data into exceptionally good accord for chain lengths 1 to 12. Thus, the subsite model quantitatively accounts for many important thermodynamic and kinetic facets of enzyme-substrate interactions. Our results reveal that the specific glycosidic monomer undergoing hydrolysis is probably highly strained and that long chains are hydrolyzed more rapidly than shorter ones primarily because of increased strain. To our knowledge this is the first instance in which Michaelis parameters have been quantitatively correlated with product patterns over a wide range of chain lengths."
https://openalex.org/W1527400088,"Abstract Nucleohistone is completely transformed into nucleoprotamine as a result of the replacement of histones by protamine during maturation of spermatids in rainbow trout. The chromatin isolated from the spermatids undergoing active chromosomal transformation has been fractionated into the nucleohistone and the nucleoprotamine portions. The latter has been found to contain a fraction of DNA, the histones of which have been partially replaced by protamine. Chemical characterization of these chromatin fractions as well as studies of their dissociation by salt and protamine added in vitro suggest that processes other than direct displacement of histones by protamine or by increased ionic strength are important in the biological displacement. The presence in the nucleoprotamine fraction of a highly heterogeneous series of basic protein fragments suggests that proteolysis places an important role in the removal of histones from the chromatin during the transformation process."
https://openalex.org/W1493942187,"Abstract Benzene 1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid was found to be a sufficiently potent of citrate transport by rat liver mitochondria that it may be used in inhibitor stop experiments. It was thus possible to measure the initial rates of exchange reactions catalyzed by the citrate-transporting system and to study the dependence of the rate on temperature and the concentrations of citrate, malate, and Mg2+. Both the rate and extent of exchange of l-malate with intramitochondrial [14C]citrate were less than that of citrate with intramitochondrial [14C]citrate. This difference in the rate and extent between the two exchanges was thought to be due to the fact that l-malate-[14C]citrate exchange resulted in a disequilibrium of either charge or pH across the mitochondrial membrane. It is proposed that malate2- exchanges for citrate2- rather than citrate3-, thereby setting up a pH differential which restricts further exchange."

https://openalex.org/W1559445239,"Abstract Under appropriate conditions, mitochondria from red and white skeletal muscle of rabbit and from heart and liver of rat respired as rapidly with palmitoyl-coenzyme A plus carnitine as with palmitoyl carnitine. The ability of heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria to oxidize palmitoyl groups is limited by the acetyl-CoA-producing capacity of the β oxidation cycle rather than through a limitation of the citric acid cycle or by the capacity of electron transport oxidative phosphorylation system. In liver mitochondria, however, acetyl-CoA production from palmitoyl group appears to be limited by the capacity of the electron transport oxidative phosphorylation system. Mitochondria of liver, like those of heart or skeletal muscles, oxidize palmitoyl groups nearly completely to CO2 when the citric acid cycle is functional but only to the oxidation level of acetate when the operation of the citric acid cycle is blocked. Under the latter conditions, the rate of acetyl group production from palmitoyl group increases in mitochondria of liver but not in those of heart or of skeletal muscles. Thus ketone body production in liver may be dependent on the suppression of the citric acid cycle. The activities of carnitine palmitoyltransferase and of ATP-dependent long chain acyl-CoA synthetase are unlikely to limit fatty acid oxidation in tissues of adult animals. It is suggested that the prevailing concentration ratio of long chain acyl-CoA esters to that of ADP near mitochondria may be one of the important factors that normally controls the rate of long chain fatty acid oxidation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1553635761,"Abstract Glycera dibranchiata hemoglobin was previously noted to comprise five components separable by electrophoresis, two of which were due to monomeric forms and the remaining three due to polymeric forms. The three polymeric carboxyhemoglobin components had isoelectric points (pI) of pH 5.6, 6.1, and 6.5 while those of the monomeric proteins were pH 7.1 and 7.4. Oxidation of the pigment to methemoglobin caused an increase in each isoelectric point of 0.4 to 0.7. The spectral properties of the oxy-, deoxy-, carboxy-, met-, cyanomet-, and azide forms of the polymeric hemoglobin closely resembled those of vertebrate hemoglobins while analogous forms of the monomeric hemoglobin showed some anomalous properties, most notably in the high spin derivatives. The binding of hydroxide by methemoglobin at 4° indicated the formation of a normal hydroxide complex for the polymer (pK = 9.08, n = 0.98, where n represents the stoichiometry of the reaction) but a mixture of hydroxide and possibly imidazole methemoglobin complexes for the monomer. The pK for the transition in the monomer was 8.99 (n = 1.94) in the presence of methylamine buffer, while in glycine, pK = 10.08, n = 1.10. Studies of the binding of the monomeric methemoglobin with azide, cyanide, and fluoride at 22° gave the following dissociation constants. Kdissmethbcn = 1.2 x 10-3 m, n = 1.05, pH = 6.85 Kdissmethbn3 = 2.2 x 10-3 m, n = 0.97, pH = 6.45 Kdissmethbn3 = 2.7 x 10-3 m, n = 0.96, pH = 7.30 Kdissmethbf = 9.4 x 10-3 m, n = 1.01, pH = 6.85 where MetHbCn is cyanomethemoglobin, MetHbN3 is the azide form of methemoglobin, and MetHbF is fluoromethemoglobin. Amino acid analysis of preparative disc gel purified monomer indicated the presence of 144 amino acids yielding a globin molecular weight of ∼18,200 and a hemoglobin molecular weight of ∼18,800. The amino acid compositions of the nonpurified monomer and polymer were different from each other as well as from the purified monomer. The number of amino acids found in the nonpurified hemoglobin analyses was suggestive of the heterogeneity of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1538506738,"Abstract Through the use of a sensitive and specific gas chromatographic assay, the concentration of monogalactosyl diglyceride has been measured in whole brain and in fractions of brain from rats of varying age. The concentration of monogalactosyl diglyceride in whole brain was barely measurable before 10 days of age; increased sharply especially after 16 days up to about 20 days of age; and then decreased rather quickly to adult values. In adult brain, most of the monogalactosyl diglyceride was associated with myelin (64 to 68%); the next highest amount (15 to 18%) was recoverable from the microsomal fractions. In brains undergoing active myelination the greater part of the monogalactosyl diglyceride appeared in the microsomal fraction up to the age of 20 days. After 20 days the quantity of the galactosyl diglyceride decreased precipitously in the microsomal fraction, and increased sharply in the small myelin fraction. In the actively myelinating brain very little monogalactosyl diglyceride is found in the large myelin fraction; however in adult brain there are equal amounts in the small and large myelin fractions. Thus the galactosyl lipid is associated with an increasingly larger particle as the animal ages into adulthood. The enzyme activity responsible for the biosynthesis of the galactosyl diglyceride resided almost exclusively (88% of total) in the microsomal fraction. These data indicate that a temporal relationship exists between the site of synthesis (microsomal) and site of deposition (myelin) of monogalactosyl diglyceride. This suggestion was confirmed by the finding that the specific radioactivity of monogalactosyl diglyceride in myelin from 23-day-old rats was the same as the specific radioactivity of monogalactosyl diglyceride derived from the microsomal fraction of brain from 20-day-old rats."
https://openalex.org/W1528996249,"Abstract In the initial step of the Goulian-Lucas-Kornberg model for the in vitro synthesis of DNA by the T4 DNA polymerase, a short sequence of nucleotides at the 3' terminus of the single stranded DNA substrate base pairs with an internal nucleotide sequence of the same strand, forming a loop. With the use of the 3' terminus as a primer, the polymerase then replicates the rest of the strand to form a hairpin structure. In this communication, evidence for a refinement of this model is presented. It appears that the loop is formed by base pairing of two internal sequences, one near the 3' terminus and one further back on the same strand. The polymerase then binds to the unpaired 3' terminus and by virtue of its hydrolytic activity degrades it exonucleolytically. When the polymerase reaches the base-paired region it reverses direction and begins incorporating nucleotides, finally yielding the hairpin structure."
https://openalex.org/W1492729438,"Abstract A new histone has been isolated from testis cells of the rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii) and the initial characterization of this protein has been performed. This histone (forming about 0.5% of the total histones), was easily dissociated from purified chromatin either by chemical modification with maleic anhydride or by extraction at low salt or trichloroacetic acid concentrations. The histone was purified either by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-10 eluted with 0.01 n HCl or by ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethylcellulose eluted with a linear gradient of lithium chloride. The molecular weight was determined to be 14,500 by the mobility of the formylated derivative during sodium dodecyl sulfateacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Dansylation revealed proline to be the amino terminus and amino acid analyses showed the complete absence of 7 amino acids including the aromatic and sulfur-containing residues. Three amino acids, lysine, alanine, and proline, accounted for 60% of the residues in the protein. Peptide maps of the tryptic peptides of the histone showed 13 unique peptides and thus ruled out an origin by degradation of one of the major histones. The new histone resembles histone I in the high content of lysine and alanine but is more similar to histone IIb2 in its molecular weight of 14,500, a prolyl N terminus, and a lysine to arginine ratio of 3:1. Pending primary structural data which should reveal whether this histone should be classified as more similar to histone I or histone IIb2, we propose to call it histone T (for trout)."
https://openalex.org/W1574304210,"Abstract Several factors which influence the release of lipoprotein lipase activity from fat cells incubated at 23° in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing glucose and albumin were studied. Release was partially reduced when either glucose, calcium, or potassium was omitted and was not detectable when albumin was omitted from this medium. During 45 min of incubation approximately 3 times as much lipoprotein lipase activity was found in the medium compared to the intracellular levels which remained constant during this period. When protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide the amount of intracellular lipoprotein lipase activity as well as the amount of this enzyme activity released was essentially unchanged. It is concluded that release of lipoprotein lipase activity from fat cells does not require protein synthesis under the conditions investigated. To explain the 3-fold increase in enzyme activity in the absence of protein synthesis we also suggest that lipoprotein lipase is activated prior to or in conjunction with release from these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1533594274,"Abstract Infection of Aerobacter aerogenes with a phage isolated from raw sewage induces the de novo synthesis of a polysaccharide depolymerase active against the capsular polysaccharide of the host organism. The enzyme exists in two forms, soluble and phage-bound. The soluble form has been purified to apparent homogeneity, as judged by disc gel electrophoresis and molecular sieve chromatography, and possesses the following molecular properties: (a) sedimentation coefficient, 10.7 S; (b) Stokes radius, 86.2 A; (c) molecular weight, 379,000; and (d) frictional ratio, 1.77. Treatment of depolymerase with sodium dodecyl sulfate at 42–62° results in dissociation to two apparently nonidentical subunits with molecular weights of 63,200 and 36,400. Depolymerase is a highly specific glycanohydrolase which randomly attacks the galactosyl-α-1 → 3-galactose linkages of the capsular polysaccharide; one susceptible bond occurs in each tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the polymer. Depolymerase activity may be conveniently assayed by the release of reducing groups; the pH optimum of the enzyme is 5.2. Treatment of capsular polysaccharide with NaIO4 and NaBH4 selectively degrades the glucuronate branches; the resultant polysaccharide is digested by depolymerase at less than 1% the rate of native capsular polysaccharide. The smallest oligosaccharide that depolymerase will degrade is a dodecasaccharide, termed C, composed of three tetrasaccharide repeating units. Reduced C is digested by depolymerase at 1% of the rate of capsular polysaccharide and is degraded in a highly specific manner; only the galactosylgalactose linkage immediately adjacent to the terminal, nonreducing tetrasaccharide repeating unit is attacked. The phage-bound and soluble depolymerases are identical with respect to their catalytic properties. Treatment of phage with either 8 m urea or 4 m guanidine·HCl results in quantitative solubilization of the phage-bound depolymerase activity. The solubilized enzyme is indistinguishable from the soluble enzyme isolated from cell lysates as judged by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1528750436,"Galactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide (CTH) was extracted and purified from pooled normal human kidney tissue and also from the kidney of a patient with Fabry's disease, a glycosphingolipid storage disease characterized by a defect in the catabolism of CTH. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the intact molecules were recorded at 100 and 220 MHz in pyridine-d5 at various temperatures. The characteristics of signals attributable to the anomeric protons are consistent with the following structural features: a β- d -glucopyranosyl residue linked to ceramide (H-1, doublet, δ = 4.74 ppm, J = 7.6 Hz);an internal, β- d -galactopyranosyl residue (H-1, doublet, δ = 4.94 ppm, J = 7.5 Hz);a terminal α- d -galactopyranosyl residue (H-1, doublet, δ = 5.45 ppm, J = 4.1 Hz). Optical rotatory data are also consistent with such a formulation for the glycolipid. CTH and lactosylceramide labeled in the terminal d -galactosyl moiety were prepared by oxidation with the enzyme d -galactose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.-) and reduction of the resulting hexodialdoses with [3H]NaBH4. With the use of these substrates, it was found that the terminal d -galactosidic linkage of CTH, but not of lactosylceramide, was hydrolyzed by partially purified α- d -galactoside galactohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.22) from green coffee beans. These physicochemical and enzymic data are presented as proof that the terminal d -galactopyranosyl residue of the CTH of human renal tissue has the α stereoconfiguration."

https://openalex.org/W1557572803,"Abstract Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels along a pH gradient from 6.0 to 8.0 yields six distinct rat red cell hemoglobin fractions. A preparative adaptation of this technique permitted the isolation of each of the six hemoglobins in a pure state. Their molecular weights are similar to that of human hemoglobin, they dissociate in dilute solution, and they separate completely into subunits of molecular weight 16,000 when examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amino acid content of all six fractions is similar but surface carboxyl groups vary in such a way as to account for the differences in isoelectric points. Hemoglobin Fraction IV is the major component in the red cell (36%), whereas Fraction V is the major hemoglobin in the bone marrow (37%) and spleen (38%). The erythroid cells of the marrow and spleen, in addition to the six hemoglobins observed in the red cell, contain two additional, more acidic, components. In vivo pulse labeling of marrow erythroid cells was performed in splenectomized rats with serum-bound 59Fe. Incorporation of the isotope into each of the six hemoglobins of circulating red cells at various time intervals yielded a pattern of specific activities, which leads to the conclusions that Fraction V is synthesized mostly in the youngest erythroid cells of the marrow, whereas Fraction IV is synthesized mostly in the older marrow cells."
https://openalex.org/W1826610883,"Abstract The brain of the jimpy mouse, a mutant with a severe deficiency of myelin in the central nervous system, has little ability to synthesize galactosyl diglyceride. Lipase and α- and β-galactosidase activity in the brain of the jimpy were the same as in normal littermates. Thus the very low concentration of monogalactosyl diglyceride found in the brain of the jimpy (19 nmoles per g, wet wt) compared with the normal (438 nmoles per g, wet wt) must be attributed to low synthesis by a galactosyltransferase pathway rather than to overly active degradative enzymes. The galactosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of psychosine and cerebroside was also reduced in the jimpy brain. The small amount of monogalactosyl diglyceride that is found in the jimpy is restricted predominantly to the microsomal fraction, whereas normal littermates of identical age had monogalactosyl diglyceride in both myelin and microsomal fractions of brain. The jimpy mouse appears to be unable to transfer galactosyl diglyceride from microsomes (site of synthesis) to myelin (site of deposition). The relative inability of the jimpy mouse to make and to transfer galactosyl diglyceride to myelin correlates well with relative absence of myelin in the jimpy and supports the contention that the galactosyl diglycerides are associated with the process of myelination."
https://openalex.org/W1483257388,"Abstract The linkage of dermatan sulfate to protein and the structure of the carbohydrate sequence in the linkage region have been investigated. It has been shown that the carbohydrate-protein linkage is a glycosidic bond between xylose and the hydroxyl group of serine. Four oligosaccharide fragments from the linkage region were isolated after partial acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharide: 3-O-β-d-glucuronosyl-d-galactose, 3-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-galactose, 4-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-xylose, and 3-O-β-d-galactosyl-4-O-β-d-galactosyl-d-xylose. The characterization of these oligosaccharides establishes the following structure for the linkage region: ...β-d-GlcUA-(1 → 3)-β-d-Gal-(1 → 3)-β-d-Gal-(1 → 4)-d-Xyl-O-Ser This carbohydrate sequence is identical with that previously found for chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, and heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1498774601,"Abstract The inactive precursor (zymogen) of the insect protease cocoonase has been identified and purified from galeae of the silkmoth, Antheraea polyphemus. Prococoonase can be activated proteolytically, with either trypsin, subtilisin, active cocoonase, or a protease mixture isolated from the moulting fluid of A. polyphemus. The molecular weight of the zymogen is estimated as 33,000, whereas active cocoonase collected from moths has a molecular weight of approximately 24,500. Ion exchange chromatography and disc gel electrophoresis indicate that the zymogen is significantly more acidic than active cocoonase. The evolution of serine proteases is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1535513960,"Abstract Neurospora crassa lysine auxotroph strain 33933 was grown on a carnitine-free synthetic medium with either dl-[6-14C]lysine (Experiment 1), or dl-[1-14C]lysine (Experiment 2) together with 0.2 mm dl-lysine sufficient for ample growth. Carnitine was then purified from mycelial extracts of the mold by ion exchange chromatography and examined for radioactivity. In Experiment 1, radioactivity derived from [6-14C]lysine was incorporated into carnitine without dilution; and the radioactivity in such carnitine could not be dissociated from carnitine following thin layer chromatography. In contrast, radioactivity from dl-[1-14C]lysine, Experiment 2, was not detected in biosynthesized carnitine. These data thus provide evidence for the direct involvement of a portion of the lysine molecule in carnitine biosynthesis in N. crassa. A rationale for a lysine:carnitine-precursor:product relationship is offered in terms of recently discovered e-N-methyl lysine derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W1519857612,"Abstract Active aldehyde derivatives of thiamine were prepared from thiamine and acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde: 2-(α-hydroxyethyl)-thiamine (HET), 2-(α-hydroxybenzyl)-thiamine (HBT), and 2-(α-hydroxy-α-cyclohexylmethyl)-thiamine (HCMT), respectively. The proton magnetic resonance spectrum of each adduct is consistent with its proposed structure. The relative rates of H-D exchange of the α-protons (OCH) of the respective adducts gave an order of acidity of the α-carbon positions consistent with the expected inductive effect of the adjacent substituent on the stability of the carbanion, i.e. HBT g HET g HCMT. Accordingly, a mixture of thiamine, benzaldehyde, and acetaldehyde gave mainly benzoylmethylcarbinol and unreacted HET. This also confirms that the carbonyl carbon of acyloins arises from the carbon atom directly attached to the catalyst. Thiamine-catalyzed benzoin formation is apparently a general base-catalyzed, first order reaction dependent on HBT (α-carbanion) concentration. In the absence of enzyme, thiamine decarboxylates phenylglyoxylate to benzaldehyde."

In all cases, the content of vitamin A per Kupffer cell was found to be less than one-tenth that of the average liver cell, and the Kupffer cell population was calculated to contain less than 4% of the total vitamin, the rest being present in the hepatocytes. The same distribution of the vitamin was found 1 hour after its intravenous infusion as [14C]retinol."
https://openalex.org/W1538916428,"Abstract The transport of self-associating macromolecules on molecular sieve columns has been investigated by computer simulation. The chromatographic behavior of monomer-trimer, monomer-tetramer, and monomer-octamer systems has been simulated in order to study the effects of several important variables on reaction boundary shape. These variables include flow rate, gel porosity, gel particle diameter, development time, and equilibrium constant. A given self-associating solute can be expected to yield appreciably different boundary profiles on gels of different porosities and bead sizes or on the same column at different flow rates. Results of the simulations indicate that axial dispersion contributes substantially to the shape of solute profiles. The effect of axial dispersion on boundary shapes was evaluated by comparing the simulated profiles with quantitative predictions of the corresponding asymptotic equations in which axial dispersion is assumed to be absent. Substantial differences were found between equilibrium constants and centroid parameters predicted from the asymptotic equations and those of the simulated profiles. The role of axial dispersion was investigated further by simulations in which all nondispersive transport was assumed to be absent. It was found that bimodal derivative patterns can arise from simultaneous dispersive transport and chemical reaction in the absence of the translational components. Results of the simulated chromatographic cases were compared with simulations of velocity sedimentation of the same solute systems in order to evaluate similarities and differences between the two types of transport behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1542183911,"A galactosyltransferase has been found in a particulate preparation prepared from normal canine respiratory tissue which catalyzes the transfer of galactose from its uridine diphosphate derivative to N-acetylgalactosamine residues. The transfer to sialidase-treated ovine submaxillary mucin was dependent upon Mn2+ and was stimulated several-fold by Triton X-100. The optimal pII was between 6 and 7. The Km was 7 x 10-4 m for UDP-galactose and 1 x 10-3 m for sialidase-treated ovine submaxillary mucin. Removal of the N-acetylgalactosamine residues on this acceptor reduced the incorporation of galactose. The enzyme was present throughout the airway passage with some evidence of higher activity in the lower portion of the trachea and the extrapulmonary primary bronchi. Fetuin from which sialic acid and galactose were removed was also an acceptor (Km = 0.9 x 10-3 m ). When the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues were removed from this acceptor, the incorporation of galactose was reduced. No competition was demonstrated when this acceptor was mixed with sialidase-treated ovine submaxillary mucin; this suggests that there are at least two separate galactosyltransferases present in canine respiratory tissue or two catalytic sites on the same molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1559625990,"The technique of fluorescence polarization was used to study the rotational mobility of pyridoxyl 5-phosphate covalently bound to the e-amino group of a lysine residue. A Perrin's plot of the polarization of fluorescence data obtained by varying the viscosity of the solution shows a downward curvature at T/η values lower than 104. Two rotational relaxation times (ρs = 0.16 nsec) and (ρh = 8.7 nsec) are needed to fit the experimental curve. Both rotational relaxation times are shorter than the value (ρh = 25 nsec) obtained for lysozyme tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate; they do not correlate with the value expected (ρh = 20 nsec) for the equivalent hydrated sphere of 14,500 molecular weight. A comparison between the rotational relaxation times of pyridoxyl 5-phosphate lysozyme, pyridoxyl-lysine, and the pyridoxyl 5-phosphate peptide reveals that the shortest rotational relaxation time (ρs = 0.16 nsec) of lysozyme reflects the motion of the pyridoxyl 5-phosphate chromophore linked the e-amino group of lysine. The effect of tri-N-acetylglucosamine on the degree of polarization of fluorescence of lysozyme was examined over a wide range of temperatures. The results of these studies indicate that the polarized fluorescence emitted by pyridoxyl 5-phosphate is influenced by events occurring at the level of the polypeptide chain."

https://openalex.org/W1483165193,"Abstract Crystalline pig heart fumarase was previously shown to comprise a large number of active components separable by ion exchange chromatography. We have explored the nature of this heterogeneity by dissociating the tetrameric molecule in urea and analyzing the subunits in an electrofocusing column. The results indicate that fumarase contains several subunit types, i.e. at least three major and three minor components, which differ in primary structure. Each subunit type can reassociate to form active enzyme species upon removal of the urea, indicating that the enzyme need not be a heterooligomer to function. Also, hybrid formation from a mixture of subunit types is shown, a result which readily explains the high degree of heterogeneity observed for this enzyme. Fumarase prepared from single pig hearts under conditions designed to minimize proteolysis displays the same isozyme peaks as does the commercial enzyme. This shows that the heterogeneity is not due to pooling of genetically different hearts, and also suggests that the major isozyme components are not the result of enzymatic alteration during isolation. The results suggest that either there are several fumarase genes, or that modification of the enzyme occurs in vivo after synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1518106648,"Abstract Two 36-amino acid-containing peptides (α1-CB2), isolated from rat skin and tendon collagen by cleavage of the α1 chain with CNBr, were subjected to enzymatic hydroxylation with collagen proline hydroxylase. The peptides differed initially only in that the ratio of hydroxyproline to proline was considerably lower in the tendon peptide, although the imino acid content of the two peptides was the same. In vitro hydroxylation produced a 75% increase in the hydroxyproline content of the tendon peptide but only an 8% increase in hydroxyproline in the skin peptide. These findings provide direct confirmation of the suggestion, made in an earlier study, that intracellular factors other than the sequences of collagen chains in skin and tendon account for the differences in the degree of hydroxylation of susceptible prolyl residues. Intact collagen preparations from various sources were similarly shown to be underhydroxylated. The distribution of newly formed hydroxyproline in α1-CB2 was investigated by analysis of chymotryptic fragments. Hydroxylation was largely limited to one of these fragments as predicted if hydroxylation occurred only at position 3 of the collagen triplet Gly-X-Y, i.e. at prolyl residues followed by glycine. This finding is in agreement with sequence analyses of vertebrate collagens and with enzymatic studies using synthetic peptides."

https://openalex.org/W1567723438,"Abstract Kinetic models have been constructed which simulate the accumulation of trehalose during differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum. These models predict that trehalose synthetase activity in vivo does not increase during the same period in which in vitro analyses indicate an accumulation of this enzyme. The models also predict that the rate of trehalose synthesis in vivo should increase very rapidly over a brief period of time late in culmination, and be of the order of 0.03 µmole per min per ml of packed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1575246831,"Abstract Acetoacetyl coenzyme A thiolase activity of rat liver and 3-oxo acid CoA transferase activity of rat kidney were increased by 77% and 45%, respectively, after a diet containing 45% fat was given ad libitum for 1 week. No increase in activity of these two enzymes was noted in brain, not even after the rats were on the diet for 2 weeks. The data suggest that the ability of the adult rat brain to utilize ketone bodies does not depend on the nutritional state of the rat."
https://openalex.org/W1597303983,"Abstract The reaction of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene with isolated α chains in their mercaptide form with p-mercuribenzoate (PMB) was studied. From kinetic measurements with the change in absorbance at 353 nm upon substitution of the terminal valine, the pK of this group was calculated to be 7.30. The pH-independent reaction constant was estimated to be 0.282 m-1 sec-1. Comparing the proton-binding behavior of untreated α chains with that of the chains substituted in the terminal valine (αpmbDNP) the pK of this group was calculated to be 7.4. Histidines did not appear to be dinitrophenylated. However, from the rate of liberation of protons upon the reaction of the chains with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene we concluded that they do interact with the reagent without forming a stable derivative. A pK of 6.85 and a pH-independent reaction constant of 0.023 m-1 sec-1 per individual group was calculated for these residues. From oxygen equilibrium studies on a mixture in equal amount of αpmbDNP and β chains in their mercaptide form with p-mercuribenzoate we calculated a value of 1.35 for the Hill parameter n. The s20,w of this mixture was 4.95 while it is near 2.5 when the α chains are not dinitrophenylated (Antonini et al., J. Mol. Biol., 17, 29 (1966)), indicating that the dinitrophenylation strongly favors the formation of tetramers. This high sedimentation value is consistent with a partial specific volume v = 0.731, as compared to v = 0.749 commonly used for hemoglobin (Svedberg and Pedersen, The ultracentrifuge, Oxford University Press, New York, 1940)."
