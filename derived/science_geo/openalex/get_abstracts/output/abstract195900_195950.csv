The glycogen is precipitated from the extract by alcohol and determined either by copper reduction after separation by centrifugation, acid hydrolysis, and neutralization (l-3) or by direct treatment of the precipitated glycogen with anthrone reagent (4-6). An alternative procedure is to destroy alkali-labile carbohydrate by boiling with KOH and then determine the glycogen in the alkali-treated mixture with anthrone reagent (5, 7). Previously, we have reported that a method based upon the use of anthrone reagent gave results of a high degree of specificity and precision (8). This method is a modification of procedures for the determination of dextran (9) and biood sugar (10). In this paper we are reporting in detail our anthrone-adapted method, with critical studies of procedures based upon extraction of tissues with 30 per cent KOH and with 5 per cent TCA."

the proteins of rabbit reticulocytes in vitro and the stimulation of this process
by certain amino acids, iron, fructose-amino acids, glucose, and some,
as yet, unidentified material in the filtrate of boiled plasma. The incorporation
was measured in the mixture of the total proteins of the reticulocytes
(1, 2).

In the study reported here two protein fractions were isolated, the hemoglobin,
which comprises more than 75 per cent of the total, and the water-insoluble
proteins. The hemoglobin was fractionated into heme and globin.
Experiments were carried out with four C^(14)-labeled amino acids and with
different stimulators to ascertain whether heme synthesis and amino acid
incorporation went parallel or not."

https://openalex.org/W2112249986,"Although Aspergillus niger, strain 72-4, has been studied previously because of the high yields of citric acid it gives when fermenting sugars, it also produces oxalic acid under the proper conditions. The present work is a study of the conditions under which oxalic acid is formed, the substrates that are converted to it, and the mechanism of its formation from these substrates. Oxalic acid is never found in normal growth fermentations with strain 72-4 until after autolysis has begun. However, in replacement fermentations in which preformed, washed mycelium is resuspended in nitrogen-free medium, oxalic acid is often formed together with citric acid. It was originally suggested (1) that oxalic acid is made by hydrolytic splitting of oxalacetate. Later work (2, 3), although consistent with this theory, gave data more in line with the results of the present work, which indicate that oxalacetate is oxidatively split to 2 molecules of oxalic acid. Direct oxidation of acetate to oxalate was ruled out by the work of Bomstein and Johnson (3) and also by the present work. The present study also shows that, at neutral pH, a great variety of sugars and related compounds can be fermented to oxalic acid by fluoride and fluoroacetate-insensitive pathways. Compounds part of or related to the Krebs cycle still appear to form oxalic acid by oxidative splitting of oxalacetate."

https://openalex.org/W3024090766,"A CRUDE extract of Pseudomonas fluorescens was found to oxidize a reduced dye, 2,6-dichlorobenz-enoneindo-3′-chlorophenol. The activity in the crude extracts seemed similar to the ‘dye oxidase’ activity described by Smith and Stotz in plant tissues1. On partial purification, the ‘dye oxidase’ activity was always associated with a pigmented component. Spectral analysis of this pigment in the reduced and oxidized state indicated that it had an absorption similar to the respective states of cytochrome c. However, this pigment is not reduced by reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide using purified tri-phosphopyridine cytochrome c reductase obtained from liver2."

https://openalex.org/W2046998870,"IT is generally believed that the action of pitressin, and more specifically, antidiuretic hormone, is entirely referable to its effects on the kidney. Although an extrarenal site of action has been suggested, the evidence has not been convincing1. Our recent studies in the rat suggested that pitressin might have an extrarenal action in this mammal2. This would agree with the findings in other vertebrate classes3."
