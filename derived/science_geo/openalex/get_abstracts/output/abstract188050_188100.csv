https://openalex.org/W2004640739,"The HIV-1 accessory protein Vif (virion infectivity factor) is required for the production of infectious virions by CD4(+) lymphocytes. Vif facilitates particle infectivity by blocking the inhibitory activity of APOBEC3G (CEM15), a virion-encapsidated cellular protein that deaminates minus-strand reverse transcript cytosines to uracils. We report that HIV-1 Vif forms a complex with human APOBEC3G that prevents its virion encapsidation. HIV-1 Vif did not efficiently form a complex with mouse APOBEC3G. Vif dramatically reduced the amount of human APOBEC3G encapsidated in HIV-1 virions but did not prevent encapsidation of mouse or AGM APOBEC3G. As a result, these enzymes are potent inhibitors of wild-type HIV-1 replication. The species-specificity of this interaction may play a role in restricting HIV-1 infection to humans. Together these findings suggest that therapeutic intervention that either induced APOBEC3G or blocked its interaction with Vif could be clinically beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W1969212379,"The vertebrate body plan has conserved handed left-right (LR) asymmetry that is manifested in the heart, lungs, and gut. Leftward flow of extracellular fluid at the node (nodal flow) is critical for normal LR axis determination in the mouse. Nodal flow is generated by motile node cell monocilia and requires the axonemal dynein, left-right dynein (lrd). In the absence of lrd, LR determination becomes random. The cation channel polycystin-2 is also required to establish LR asymmetry. We show that lrd localizes to a centrally located subset of node monocilia, while polycystin-2 is found in all node monocilia. Asymmetric calcium signaling appears at the left margin of the node coincident with nodal flow. These observations suggest that LR asymmetry is established by an entirely ciliary mechanism: motile, lrd-containing monocilia generate nodal flow, and nonmotile polycystin-2 containing cilia sense nodal flow initiating an asymmetric calcium signal at the left border of the node."
https://openalex.org/W2074187493,"Cancer cells are able to proliferate at accelerated rates within the confines of a three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in type I collagen. The mechanisms used by tumor cells to circumvent endogenous antigrowth signals have yet to be clearly defined. We find that the matrix metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP, confers tumor cells with a distinct 3D growth advantage in vitro and in vivo. The replicative advantage conferred by MT1-MMP requires pericellular proteolysis of the ECM, as proliferation is fully suppressed when tumor cells are suspended in 3D gels of protease-resistant collagen. In the absence of proteolysis, tumor cells embedded in physiologically relevant ECM matrices are trapped in a compact, spherical configuration and unable to undergo changes in cell shape or cytoskeletal reorganization required for 3D growth. These observations identify MT1-MMP as a tumor-derived growth factor that regulates proliferation by controlling cell geometry within the confines of the 3D ECM."
https://openalex.org/W2054511300,"During the ribosomal translocation, the binding of elongation factor G (EF-G) to the pretranslocational ribosome leads to a ratchet-like rotation of the 30S subunit relative to the 50S subunit in the direction of the mRNA movement. By means of cryo-electron microscopy we observe that this rotation is accompanied by a 20 A movement of the L1 stalk of the 50S subunit, implying that this region is involved in the translocation of deacylated tRNAs from the P to the E site. These ribosomal motions can occur only when the P-site tRNA is deacylated. Prior to peptidyl-transfer to the A-site tRNA or peptide removal, the presence of the charged P-site tRNA locks the ribosome and prohibits both of these motions."

https://openalex.org/W1976009156,"During angiosperm reproduction, pollen grains form a tube that navigates through female tissues to the micropyle, delivering sperm to the egg; the signals that mediate this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe a role for gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in pollen tube growth and guidance. In vitro, GABA stimulates pollen tube growth, although vast excesses are inhibitory. The Arabidopsis POP2 gene encodes a transaminase that degrades GABA and contributes to the formation of a gradient leading up to the micropyle. pop2 flowers accumulate GABA, and the growth of many pop2 pollen tubes is arrested, consistent with their in vitro GABA hypersensitivity. Some pop2 tubes continue to grow toward ovules, yet they are misguided, presumably because they target ectopic GABA on the ovule surface. Interestingly, wild-type tubes exhibit normal growth and guidance in pop2 pistils, perhaps by degrading excess GABA and sharpening the gradient leading to the micropyle."
https://openalex.org/W2056070148,"Phosphoinositides (PtdInsPs) play critical roles in cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways. However, their functions in the nucleus are unclear, as specific nuclear receptors for PtdInsPs have not been identified. Here, we show that ING2, a candidate tumor suppressor protein, is a nuclear PtdInsP receptor. ING2 contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, a motif common to many chromatin-regulatory proteins. We find that the PHD fingers of ING2 and other diverse nuclear proteins bind in vitro to PtdInsPs, including the rare PtdInsP species, phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P). Further, we demonstrate that the ING2 PHD finger interacts with PtdIns(5)P in vivo and provide evidence that this interaction regulates the ability of ING2 to activate p53 and p53-dependent apoptotic pathways. Together, our data identify the PHD finger as a phosphoinositide binding module and a nuclear PtdInsP receptor, and suggest that PHD-phosphoinositide interactions directly regulate nuclear responses to DNA damage."

https://openalex.org/W2137163623,"The SNARE complex, consisting of synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25, is essential for calcium-triggered exocytosis in neurosecretory cells. Little is known, however, about how developmentally regulated isoforms and other cognate SNARE components regulate vesicular fusion. To address this question, we examined neuroexocytosis from chromaffin cells of Snap25 null mice rescued by the two splice variants SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b and the ubiquitously expressed homolog SNAP-23. In the absence of SNAP-25, vesicle docking persisted, but primed vesicle pools were empty and fast calcium-triggered release abolished. Single vesicular fusion events showed normal characteristics, except for a shorter duration of the fusion pore. Overexpression of SNAP-25a, SNAP-25b, and SNAP-23 resulted in three distinct phenotypes; SNAP-25b induced larger primed vesicle pools than SNAP-25a, whereas SNAP-23 did not support a standing pool of primed vesicles. We conclude that three alternative SNARE components support exocytosis, but they differ in their ability to stabilize vesicles in the primed state."

https://openalex.org/W2118733942,"Modification-specific antibodies were used to characterize the phosphorylation and acetylation of human p53 in response to genotoxic (UV, IR, and adriamycin) and non-genotoxic (PALA, taxol, nocodazole) stress in cultured human cells at 14 known modification sites. In A549 cells, phosphorylation or acetylation was induced at most sites by the three DNA damage-inducing agents, but significant differences between agents were observed. IR-induced phosphorylation reached a maximum 2 h after treatment and returned to near pretreatment levels by 72 h; UV light and adriamycin induced a less rapid but more robust and prolonged p53 phosphorylation, which reached a maximum between 8 and 24 h, but persisted (UV) even 96 h after treatment. Ser33, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser392 were more efficiently phosphorylated after exposure to UV light than after IR. The non-genotoxic agents PALA, taxol and nocodazole induced p53 accumulation and phosphorylation at Ser6, Ser33, Ser46, and Ser392. Some phosphorylation at Ser15 also was observed. Modifications occurred similarly in the HCT116 human colon carcinoma cell line. Analysis of single site mutant p53s indicated clear interdependences between N-terminal phosphorylation sites, which could be classified in four clusters: Ser6 and Ser9; Ser9, Ser15, Thr18 and Ser20; Ser33 and Ser37; and Ser46. We suggest that p53 phosphorylation is regulated through a double cascade involving both the activation of secondary, effector protein kinases as well as intermolecular phosphorylation site interdependencies that check inappropriate p53 inactivation while allowing for signal amplification and the integration of signals from multiple stress pathways.

These responses are mediated, in part, by the p53 tumor suppressor gene, a transcription factor that integrates a variety of stress response signals (reviewed in Refs. 1Anderson C.W. Appella E.

Exposing cells to genotoxic agents and some non-genotoxic stresses inhibits the degradation of p53 protein through the ubiquitin-mediated pathway and also activates p53 as a DNA-binding, site-specific transcription factor. However, several studies point to important differences in the cellular responses to agents that produce primarily DNA strand breaks (e.g. IR) compared with those that primarily cause base damage such as UV light (reviewed in Refs. 5Schwartz D. Rotter V. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar and 6Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, while p53 protein increases in cells exposed to either IR or UV light, the latter induces much greater p53 transcriptional activity, measured with reporter constructs, than does IR. In fibroblasts and epithelial cells, UV light is a more effective activator of apoptosis than IR (5Schwartz D. Rotter V. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 7Meyer K.M. Hess S.M. Tlsty T.D. Leadon S.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5795-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). p53 accumulation and activation also occurs in response to several physiological processes that are not associated with frank DNA damage, including nucleotide deprivation, exposure to microtubule inhibitors, osmotic shock, and senescence potentiated by oncogene activation (see Ref. 1Anderson C.W. Appella E. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E. Handbook of Cell Signaling. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New, York2003: 237-247Google Scholar). p53 accumulation and activation are believed to be regulated through protein phosphorylations and acetylations (reviewed in Refs. 1Anderson C.W. Appella E. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E. Handbook of Cell Signaling. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New, York2003: 237-247Google Scholar and 2Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). At least 20 sites in the human p53 protein, located primarily in the N-terminal transactivation domains or in the C-terminal regulatory domain proximal or distal to the tetramerization domain, are modified in response to the activation of different stress signaling pathways (1Anderson C.W. Appella E. Bradshaw R.A. Dennis E. Handbook of Cell Signaling. Vol. 3. Academic Press, New, York2003: 237-247Google Scholar, 2Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). For example, at the N terminus of human p53, phosphorylation of Ser15, Ser20, and Ser37, after either IR or UV light, was reported to stabilize p53 (8Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S.

However, the picture of p53 post-translational modifications in response to genotoxic and non-genotoxic stresses is incomplete. To characterize the roles of post-translational modifications in mediating p53 function, we prepared antibodies that recognize 14 of the known p53 specific modification sites only when they have been modified (16Sakaguchi K.

Here we describe the phosphorylation of p53 at ten different sites in response to two different classes of DNA damaging agents, UV light and IR, in A549 cells, a commonly used line with wild-type p53 that was derived from a human lung carcinoma. We also examined phosphorylation of these sites after treatment with four non-genotoxic agents, ALLN, an inhibitor of ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the 26 S proteasome, taxol and nocodazole, which disrupt microtubules (21Stewart Z.A.

Clarkin K.C. Di Leonardo A. Tsou A. Wahl G.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). p53 in the HCT116 colon carcinoma cell line, which also expresses wild-type p53, was phosphorylated in essentially an identical manner in response to each agent. p53 acetylation was examined at two sites, Lys320 and Lys382. We furthermore examined the site interdependence of p53 phosphorylation in transient transfection assays by use of mutant p53 expression vectors that had individual serines changed to alanines at most of the reported phosphorylation sites. Together, our results demonstrate the existence of complex signaling cascades that modulate the modification state of the human p53 molecule in cells exposed to stress. Phosphorylation- and Acetylation-specific p53 Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for human p53 phosphorylated at Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Thr18, Ser20, Ser33, Ser37, Ser46, Ser315, or Ser392 or acetylated at Lys320 or Lys382 have been described (16Sakaguchi K.

Phosphorylation site-specific antibodies were affinity-purified from the resulting serum by use of each phosphorylated peptide coupled with Sulfolink (Pierce Chemical Co.). The purified antibodies then were passed through a column coupled with the respective unphosphorylated peptide to deplete antibodies that react with unphosphorylated p53. The specificity of each antibody was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and dot blot assay using synthetically prepared p53 peptides, and immunoblot assay by probing GST-human p53 expressed in Escherichia coli. Cell Cultures—A549 (ATCC CCL-185), a human lung carcinoma cell line which express wild-type p53, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manasas, VA) as was H1299 (ATCC CRL-5803), a human lung carcinoma cell line that is null for both p53 alleles. HCT116, a human colon carcinoma cell line that expresses wild-type p53, was kindly provided by B. Voglstein. A549 and H1299 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) and HCT116 cells were in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 nm glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Wild-type and p53S18A/S18A mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from p53 wild-type and p53S18A/S18A embryos. p53S23A/– MEFs were developed from corresponding mutant ES cells using the Hprt-deficient blastocyst complementation approach (25Wu Z. Earle J. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All MEFs were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 nm glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. In the case of PALA treatment, dialyzed fetal bovine serum was used. Treatment of Cell Cultures, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were seeded in plastic dishes 24 h prior to treatment and were 60–70% confluent at the time of treatment. Cultures were exposed to UV light (UV-C, 254 nm) using a Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400 or to ionizing radiation at a dose rate of 3.2 Gy per minute using a Shepherd Mark I 137Cs irradiator as described (17Saito S.

The proteasome inhibitor ALLN (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was added to cells at a final concentration of 20 μm. Adriamycin, taxol, nocodazole (Sigma Chemical Co.) and PALA (NSC224131, obtained from National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) were added to cultures and remained in the cultures until they were harvested. Final concentrations of these agents were chosen after measuring IC50 values using the WST-1 cell proliferation reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Table I). The deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (WAKO, Osaka, Japan) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm 4 h before harvest.

Phosphorylation of p53 in A549 Cells in Response to DNA Damage-inducing Agents—To characterize the post-translational modifications to p53 induced by different DNA damage-producing agents, we prepared individual polyclonal antibodies for different sites that recognize p53 only when it has been modified at that site. The specificity of each antibody was confirmed by ELISA with synthetically prepared p53 peptides or by probing an unmodified human p53 GST-fusion protein expressed in E. coli with purified antibodies. None of the antibodies reacted with the unphosphorylated, wild-type GST-p53 fusion protein (Fig. 1A and data not shown). We then used these antibodies to follow the phosphorylation of individual sites in response to treatment with three DNA damage-inducing agents, IR, UV light, or adriamycin (ADR) (17Saito S.

We also examined acetylation at two sites in the C terminus, Lys320 and Lys382, as previously described (16Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Samples were harvested before treatment and at different times after treatment and then p53 was captured by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by Western immunoblotting (see “Experimental Procedures”). We first examined the dose response of phosphorylation and acetylation to treatment with the three DNA damage-inducing agents. Fig. 1B shows the phosphorylation response after IR for doses between 2 and 32 Gy, and after UV for doses between 7 and 50 J/m2 at six representative sites: Ser6, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser315. Also shown is the induction of p53 protein, measured with a p53-specific monoclonal antibody, DO-1. For all sites except perhaps Ser20, phosphorylation was induced by 2 h after exposure to as little as 2 Gy IR; however, phosphorylation was significantly greater above 8 Gy. Similar results were seen for UV light at 8 h. Increased phosphorylation was clearly seen at Ser6 with as little as 7 J/m2; maximum induction of phosphorylation required ∼25 J/m2. Pilot studies showed that 2 h after IR and 8 h after UV were appropriate for assessing phosphorylation responses (see Fig. 2). p53 protein accumulation was maximal after exposure to 8 Gy IR or 25 J/m2 UV; higher doses did not result in significant additional accumulation. Similarly, addition of ADR to 345 nm (0.2 μg/ml) was chosen for subsequent analyses (data not shown). We next examined the time course of modifications at each of 12 p53 sites between 0.5 and 96 h after exposure to 8 Gy IR, 25 J/m2 UV light, or 345 nm ADR (Fig. 2). As expected, each treatment induced p53 accumulation, detected with the DO-1 monoclonal antibody. One set of cultures also was treated with 20 μm ALLN, which induced p53 accumulation to similar amounts (16Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). With ALLN or IR, significant accumulation was observed by one h after treatment; for UV or ADR, significant p53 accumulation clearly was observed by 4 h. Accumulation was persistent after IR, UV, and ADR, and high p53 levels remained even 4 days after exposure. After treatment with ALLN or adriamycin, p53 levels declined between 8 and 24 h after treatment. Fig. 2 shows exposure to 8 Gy IR induced a clear increase in phosphorylation at Ser6 and Ser15 by 0.5 h after treatment (17Saito S. Goodarzi A.A. Higashimoto Y. Noda Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Appella E.

For these three sites, little increase in phosphorylation was observed in response to IR at any time examined. We and others reported increased phosphorylation at Ser6 and Ser15 in response to IR as early as 15 min after treatment (16Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A.

In general, IR-induced phosphorylation declined at most sites 24 to 48 h after treatment and had returned to near pretreatment levels by 72 h (Fig. 2). In contrast, UV light induced a less rapid but more prolonged and robust increase in p53 phosphorylation. Phosphorylation increased at most sites between 2 and 4 h after UV treatment and reached a maximum between 8 and 24 h; at 96 h, significant phosphorylation was still apparent. Phosphorylation in response to ADR resembled the pattern produced by exposure to UV in robustness and timing; note, however, that ADR remained in the culture media until the cells were harvested. Remarkably, increased phosphorylation was observed at most sites in response to each of the three DNA damage-inducing agents; nevertheless, clear differences were observed (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation at most sites was more strongly induced by UV light and ADR than by IR, especially at Ser33, Ser37, Ser46, and Ser392. All three agents also promoted acetylation of Lys382, while acetylation of Lys320 was induced most strongly after UV light. The time course of acetylation was similar to phosphorylation but occurred slightly later, consistent with a role for phosphorylation in mediating p53 acetylation (14Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F.

Four sites, Ser6, Ser33, Ser315, and Ser392 appeared to be constitutively phosphorylated at a relatively low level in the absence of DNA damage (Fig. 2). For these sites, phosphorylation increased after adding ALLN in parallel with the increase in p53 protein, but the levels did not approach those observed after treatment with DNA damage-inducing agents. Constitutive phosphorylation was confirmed by showing that the antibodies did not cross-react with a larger amount of an unphosphorylated, human, GST-p53 fusion protein made in E. coli (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of p53 in A549 and HCT116 Cells in Response to Genotoxic and Non-genotoxic Agents—We next examined HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells (Fig. 3, right) and two normal human fibroblast cell strains to clarify whether the modification patterns seen in A549 cells (Fig. 3, left) were common in other cells after exposure to IR, UV, and ADR. We also examined the effects of three non-genotoxic agents known to activate p53, PALA (Fig. 3, lane 6), an inhibitor of the l-aspartate transcarbamylase component of the CAD protein that is required for pyrimidine biosynthesis, and two microtubule active drugs, taxol (Fig. 3, lane 7) and nocodazole (Fig. 3, lane 8). Cultures were treated with ADR or these three agents at three times the concentration required for the inhibition of growth by 50% (IC50, see Table I) for 8, 24, or 48 h. Cultures also were treated with 20 μm ALLN for 4 h. Extracts then were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. Each treatment induced significant p53 accumulation, detected by the p53-specific polyclonal antibody Ab-7. Except for ALLN, p53 protein accumulation was maximal by 24 h after the beginning of treatment (data not shown). With the exception of Thr18, Ser9, and Ser20, the pattern of post-translational modifications in HCT116 cells in response to IR (8 Gy, 2h; Fig. 3, right, lane 3), UV (25 J/m2, 24h; Fig. 3, right, lane 4) and ADR (51 nm,24h; Fig. 3, right, lane 5) were similar to that for A549 cells (Fig. 3, left), suggesting that the signaling pathways producing these modifications in response to DNA damage probably are common to most cell types. No phosphorylation was observed at Thr18 in HCT116 cells, and the signals for Ser9 and Ser20 were much weaker than for A549 cells. We next examined modifications at each of the 12 p53 sites after exposure for 24 h to the three non-genotoxic agents PALA, taxol, and nocodazole, each at three times their IC50 (Fig. 3). Each induced p53 accumulation to levels similar to those obtained after UV or ADR; however, only a subset of the sites showed strongly enhanced phosphorylation. Phosphorylation was induced at Ser6, Ser33, Ser46, Ser315, and Ser392 in both cell lines by PALA (Fig. 3, lane 6), taxol (Fig. 3, lane 7), and nocodazole (Fig. 3, lane 8) to levels equivalent or nearly equivalent to those obtained with UV light or ADR. In contrast, phosphorylation at Ser9, Ser15 and Ser20 (in A549 cells) was significantly weaker than with UV light or ADR, although some phosphorylation was observed at Ser15. No phosphorylation was observed at Thr18, nor was acetylation observed at Lys320. Lys382 became acetylated in response to PALA or nocodazole, but acetylation at this site was much weaker than after UV (Fig. 3, lane 4). Similar results to those shown in Fig. 3 also were obtained with WS1 normal human skin fibroblasts and MRC-5 normal human lung fibroblasts (data not shown), although in both of t"

We have determined two structures of Rho complexed with nucleic acid recognition site mimics in both free and nucleotide bound states to 3.0 A resolution. Both structures show that Rho forms a hexameric ring in which two RNA binding sites--a primary one responsible for target mRNA recognition and a secondary one required for mRNA translocation and unwinding--point toward the center of the ring. Rather than forming a closed ring, the Rho hexamer is split open, resembling a ""lock washer"" in its global architecture. The distance between subunits at the opening is sufficiently wide (12 A) to accommodate single-stranded RNA. This open configuration most likely resembles a state poised to load onto mRNA and suggests how related ring-shaped enzymes may be breached to bind nucleic acids."

Using purified components and Xenopus egg extracts, the kinetochore-associated microtubule motor CENP-E is now shown to be the activator of the essential checkpoint kinase BubR1. Since kinase activity and the checkpoint are silenced following CENP-E-dependent microtubule attachment in extracts or binding of CENP-E antibodies that do not disrupt CENP-E association with BubR1, CENP-E mediates silencing of BubR1 signaling. Checkpoint signaling requires the normal level of BubR1 containing a functional Mad3 domain implicated in Cdc20 binding, but only a small fraction need be kinase competent. This supports bifunctional roles for BubR1 in the checkpoint: an enzymatic one requiring CENP-E-dependent activation of its kinase activity at kinetochores and a stoichiometric one as a direct inhibitor of Cdc20."

The γ-secretase complex is an unusual aspartyl protease responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of a variety of type 1 integral membrane proteins. This proteolytic activity is essential for the proper functioning of the Notch receptor, a critical signaling factor in metazoan development (1Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In fact, there is a growing list of substrates that require γ-secretase-mediated processing to release their signaling moieties (2Ebinu J.O. Yankner B.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This intramembrane cleavage process and its implication in normal cell signaling have been termed regulated intramembrane proteolysis (3Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). In addition to its physiological function, γ-secretase is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, because the amyloid β-protein is generated by the γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). 1The abbreviations used are: APP, β-amyloid precursor protein; PS, presenilin; NTF, N-terminal fragment; CTF, C-terminal fragment; NCT, nicastrin; mNCT, mature NCT; iNCT, immature NCT; IP, immunoprecipitation; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CHAPSO, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid; BN, blue native; HA, hemagglutinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HEK, human embryonic kidney; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Big CHAP, N,N-bis-(3-O-gluconamidopropyl)deoxycholamide. Whereas recent studies have identified the gene products that comprise γ-secretase and established that their physical interaction is required for γ-secretase activity (see below), little is known about their specific roles in intramembrane proteolysis or the nature of the individual protein-protein interactions within the active complex. The first member of the γ-secretase complex to be identified was presenilin (PS), and extensive work during the last 5 years has suggested that it serves as the active site of the protease complex (4Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 2156-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PS is initially expressed as an unstable holoprotein of about 50 kDa, with a half-life of ∼1 h (5Zhang J.

Through what appears to be an autoproteolysis, PS holoprotein undergoes cleavage to yield an N-terminal fragment (NTF; ∼28 kDa) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF; ∼22 kDa) that remain associated (6Ratovitski T.

All presenilins contain two conserved intramembranous aspartate residues within all presenilins, and mutation of either aspartate dramatically reduces amyloid β-protein secretion and abrogates PS endoproteolysis (11Wolfe M.S.

NCT is a type 1 membrane protein that possesses many potential glycosylation sites within its large ectodomain.

Recent genetic studies in C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have revealed that two additional gene products, Aph-1 and Pen-2, are required for γ-secretase function (15Goutte C. Tsunozaki M.

However, these studies did not provide insight into the specific roles of these newly identified members in complex assembly and function. Biochemical studies in mammalian cells have recently shown that both Aph-1 and Pen-2 are physical members of the active protease and not transient interactors merely involved in assisting γ-secretase assembly or protein folding (22Steiner H.

However, the specific protein-protein interactions responsible for assembling this multimeric protease complex and their order of assembly remain unknown. Previously, we have shown that under nondenaturing conditions γ-secretase is associated with a molecular mass of ∼250–270 kDa, corresponding to the apparent combined molecular masses of PS, NCT, Aph-1, and Pen-2 (24Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observe an intermediate complex in which NCT and Aph-1 co-migrate at a molecular mass of ∼140 kDa, consistent with the predicted size of iNCT plus Aph-1. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments in multiple cell lines using antibodies against ectopically expressed as well as endogenous Aph-1 reveal a selective association between Aph-1 and iNCT. The interaction between iNCT and Aph-1 was specific, since both the PS heterodimer and Pen-2 preferentially bound mNCT. Furthermore, the partial dissociation of the mature γ-secretase complex using certain detergents demonstrates a persistent association between Aph-1 and NCT, despite disruption of the binding of PS and Pen-2. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that Aph-1 and NCT directly interact early in γ-secretase assembly, forming a stable intermediate prior to the incorporation of PS and Pen-2, PS endoproteolysis, and the final glycosylation of NCT, all of which are known to correlate with mature, active γ-secretase. Cell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells stably expressing human NCT (HEK-NCT) (a gift of P. St. George-Hyslop) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with G418 and blasticidin as previously described (16Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E. Smith M. Janus C. Zhang Y. Aebersold R. Farrer L.S.

The stable CHO cell lines designated A-5 (expressing human APP751, PS1, and Aph-1α2-HA), P-22 (expressing human APP751, PS1, and FLAG-Pen2), and γ-30 (expressing human APP751, PS1, Aph-1α2-HA, and FLAG-Pen2) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented, respectively, with G418, puromycin, zeocin; G418, puromycin, hygromycin; or G418, puromycin, zeocin, hygromycin, as previously described (24Kimberly W.T.

All transient transfections were performed using 10 μg of plasmid DNA per 10-cm dish plus LipofectAMINE 2000, as suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—One day prior to analysis, 5–13.5% polyacrylamide gels were poured as previously described (25Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). For blue native analysis on these gels, whole cell lysates from γ-30 cells were prepared in 1% digitonin, 500 mm ϵ-amino-α-caproic acid, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol (BN-PAGE lysis buffer). High molecular weight standards for native gel analysis (thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; ferritin, 440 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; lactate dehydrogenase, 140 kDa; albumin, 66 kDa) were purchased from AP Biotech. Gels were soaked in 0.1% SDS for 10 min and then electrotransferred in standard buffer with 0.01% SDS to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and Western blotted as described below. Co-immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared in 1% CHAPSO, HEPES, pH 7.4, plus a protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatants were collected. Membrane fractions were prepared as previously described (14Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and solubilized in either 1% CHAPSO or BN-PAGE lysis buffer (above). Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and 400 μg of protein were included in all IPs. Lysates were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C for 16 h, washed three times for 20 min in 1% CHAPSO lysis buffer, and collected in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. 3F10 (anti-HA) and M2 (anti-FLAG) IPs were performed using commercially available affinity resins (Roche Applied Science and Sigma, respectively). X81 is a high titer antibody to the N-terminal 81 amino acids of presenilin (8Podlisny M.B. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R. Xia W. Zhang J. Diehl T. Levesque G. Fraser P. Haass C. Koo E.H.M. Seubert P. St. George-Hyslop P. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 3: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and A89 is a high titer antibody to the C terminus of Aph-1α2 (amino acids 248–265). All SDS-PAGE analyses were performed using Novex gels (Invitrogen). Western blots were probed for PS holoprotein and NTF with either Ab14 (1:2000; gift of S. Gandy) or N-19 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); for PS CTF with 13A11 (5 μg/ml; gift of Elan Pharmaceuticals); for NCT with R302 (1:4000; gift of D. Miller and P. Savam) or guinea pig anti-NCT (1:2000; Chemicon); for Aph-1α2-HA with either 12CA5 or 3F10 (200 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml, respectively; Roche Applied Science); for FLAG-Pen2 with M2 (1:1000, Sigma); and for endogenous Aph-1 with A89 (1:500; see above). Immunoreactive bands were detected using the ECL-plus chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed onto Blue Sensitive photographic film (Marsh Bio Products, Inc.). siRNA Treatment—HEK cells stably overexpressing APPsw were plated onto polylysine-coated dishes and treated with siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon) complexed with TKO transfection reagent (Mirus) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) at ∼50% confluence. Three days later, cells were treated again with siRNA duplexes and collected 3 days later. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, and samples were protein-nor-malized and probed by Western blot as described above. Scrambled (AAU CAC GCA CAU CAC CAC GAC), NCT (AAG GGC AAG UUU CCC GUG CAG), and Pen-2 (AAG GCU AUG UCU GGC GCU CAG) duplexes were used for these experiments. Association of Aph-1 and Nicastrin in CHO Cell Lines— Previous experiments examining CHO cells stably co-expressing human APP751, PS1, Aph-1α2-HA and FLAG-Pen2 (the γ-30 cell line) revealed an immunoreactive γ-secretase complex migrating in native gels at ∼250–270 kDa (24Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). This complex contained mature forms of all of the known γ-secretase components (PS1 NTF, PS1 CTF, NCT, Aph-1, and Pen-2) co-migrating at this molecular mass (Fig. 1a). However, we also observed an apparent intermediate complex on these blue native gels that was only immunoreactive for NCT and Aph-1 and migrated at ∼140 kDa (Fig. 1a). Intriguingly, this molecular mass would be appropriate for an assembly intermediate of these two proteins if the isoform of NCT were iNCT (∼110 kDa) and this were coupled with Aph-1 (∼30 kDa). We also probed these blots for endogenous Pen-2 and found no evidence of Pen-2 at any molecular weight other than within the active γ-secretase complex (data not shown). To confirm that this putative subcomplex was not an artifact of preferential detergent solubilization or a mild denaturation of the γ-secretase complex, we also treated γ-30 cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide; 20 μg/ml) and examined for the time-dependent the decay of this complex. Data showed that immunoreactivity for both NCT and Aph-1 in this putative subcomplex rapidly diminished within the first 2 h of treatment, whereas the HMW γ-secretase, which has a half-life of ∼30 h, did not change (data not shown), demonstrating that this subcomplex was not a detergent artifact. To further investigate this putative Aph-1-NCT intermediate, we ran lysates of the γ-30 cells on BN-PAGE gels and then excised the entire lane of natively separated proteins and loaded that gel slab horizontally on to the top of a precast SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were thus electrophoresed in the second dimension in SDS in order to denature all protein complexes and verify the co-migration of γ-secretase components and also to determine the glycosylation state of the two NCT bands observed in Fig. 1a. This two-dimensional PAGE analysis revealed that the NCT immunoreactive species found at ∼250–270 kDa was predominantly composed of mNCT (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the NCT species at ∼140 kDa in the BN-PAGE gel migrated slightly faster in the SDS-PAGE dimension than did the NCT species from the 250-kDa band, suggesting that this lower NCT form is in fact iNCT. We also probed these two-dimensional PAGE blots for PS1 and found that the cleaved PS NTF co-migrated with the mNCT, consistent with an active, mature γ-secretase complex (Fig. 1b). However, we observed a small amount of iNCT that migrated somewhat faster in the first (BN-PAGE) dimension and thus was resolved slightly to the left of the mNCT in the second (SDS-PAGE) dimension (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, this band of iNCT from the ∼240-kDa complex occurred with PS holoprotein, whereas the mNCT co-migrated with PS NTF, suggesting that both a minor immature and a major mature γ-secretase complex exist at a high molecular weight. The slightly faster migration of the HMW immature complex than the HMW mature complex could be accounted for by the absence of Pen-2 (data not shown), by the difference in molecular weight of iNCT and mNCT, or by a combination of both. The existence of this immature HMW complex is consistent with the hypothetical Aph-1-NCT-PS1 complex that has been proposed from data of several groups that studied the selective disruption of Pen-2 expression. In order to further investigate the interaction between these two components, we performed a series of co-IP experiments. We chose four experimental conditions for comparison. First, we probed untransfected PS70 cells, which are CHO cells stably expressing human APP751 and PS1. Second, we examined PS70 cells transiently transfected to express a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged form of Aph-1α (PS70 + Aph-1). Third, we studied PS70 cells that stably overexpress human Aph-1α2-HA (A-5 cells). Last, we probed A-5 cells that also stably co-express FLAG-tagged human Pen-2 (γ-30 cells); this line shows substantially enhanced levels of mature γ-secretase components and protease activity (24Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared from all four of these sources and immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA affinity resin. The precipitates were then blotted with antibodies against NCT, PS1 NTF, and PS1 CTF. The results revealed essentially no NCT or PS CTF and very little nonspecific binding of PS NTF and PS holoprotein in the HA precipitates of the untransfected PS70 cells (Fig. 1c, lane 2). In the cells transiently expressing Aph-1, we readily detected iNCT and PS holoprotein in the HA precipitates but very little or no mNCT, PS1 NTF, or PS1 CTF (Fig. 1c, lane 4). Because previous experiments had shown that the transient expression of γ-secretase components results in inefficient incorporation of the exogenous protein into the endogenous complex (24Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), we next examined stable Aph-1 transfectants (the A5 line) and observed that both iNCT and mNCT were associated with the stably expressed Aph-1α2-HA (Fig. 1c, lane 6). Interestingly, only relatively small amounts of PS1 NTF and CTF were found associated with Aph-1α2-HA, even when the latter was stably expressed. On the other hand, substantial levels of PS holoprotein were found in the HA precipitates of the A-5 cells, suggesting that, like iNCT, immature (uncleaved) PS may preferentially associate with Aph-1. However, in the γ-30 cells, which express high levels of all of the γ-secretase components and in which almost all of the NCT has been converted to mNCT (24Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), we observed significant levels of both iNCT and mNCT brought down with Aph-1 (Fig 1c, lane 8). Interestingly, in these cells, which have more mature γ-secretase and therefore less of its immature components available in excess (24Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), Aph-1 bound to less PS holoprotein and more abundant amounts of PS heterodimers than the A5 line (compare lanes 6 and 8 of Fig. 1c). These results are consistent with a preferential association between Aph-1 and iNCT that is more apparent when either of these two γ-secretase components is in excess. To determine whether this preferential association with iNCT occurred for Aph-1 but not Pen-2, we performed similar co-IP experiments with PS70 cells that stably overexpress human FLAG-Pen2 (P22 cells) and with the above described γ-30 cells. As previously noted (24Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), transient expression of FLAG-Pen2 provides inefficient entry into the endogenous γ-secretase complex. On the other hand, in lysates from the stable P22 cells, anti-FLAG co-IP revealed efficient binding of FLAG-Pen2 to PS1 NTF, PS1 CTF, and mNCT (Fig. 1d), all surrogates of association with a mature, proteolytically active γ-secretase complex (14Esler W.P.

We also observed considerable levels of PS holoprotein co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Pen2, consistent with the purported role of Pen-2 in PS endoproteolysis (23Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I.

Amphotericin B administration is limited by infusion-related toxicity, including fever and chills, an effect postulated to result from proinflammatory cytokine production by innate immune cells. Because amphotericin B is a microbial product, we hypothesized that it stimulates immune cells via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and CD14. We show here that amphotericin B induces signal transduction and inflammatory cytokine release from cells expressing TLR2 and CD14. Primary murine macrophages and human cell lines expressing TLR2, CD14, and the adapter protein MyD88 responded to amphotericin B with NF-κB-dependent reporter activity and cytokine release, whereas cells deficient in any of these failed to respond. Cells mutated in TLR4 were less responsive to amphotericin B stimulation than cells expressing normal TLR4. These data demonstrate that TLR2 and CD14 are required for amphotericin B-dependent inflammatory stimulation of innate immune cells and that TLR4 may also provide stimulation of these cells. Our results provide a putative molecular basis for inflammatory responses elicited by amphotericin B and suggest strategies to eliminate the acute toxicity of this drug.

AmB, a polyene antifungal, is an amphipathic fermentation product of the Gram-positive bacterium, Streptomyces nodosus. AmB kills fungi by binding to the fungal membrane sterol, ergosterol, thus forming pores that cause lethal leakiness to the fungal membrane. AmB has the broadest spectrum of all available antifungal agents, and despite extensive use, fungal resistance to AmB is rare (1Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 5th Ed. 1. Churchill Livingstone, Philadelphia2000: 448-459Google Scholar). Unfortunately, therapeutic use of AmB is limited by its toxicity to patients, including acute, infusion-related toxicities of fever, chills, anorexia, nausea, and tachypnea, as well as chronic renal toxicity (1Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 5th Ed. 1. Churchill Livingstone, Philadelphia2000: 448-459Google Scholar). AmB is insoluble in water; thus, conventional drug preparations consist of a parenterally administered suspension of AmB admixed with deoxycholate (1Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 5th Ed. 1. Churchill Livingstone, Philadelphia2000: 448-459Google Scholar). Infusion-related toxicity occurs in up to 70% of patients (2Cleary J.D. Weisdorf D. Fletcher C.V. Drug Intell. Clin. Pharm. 1988; 22: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Cleary J.D. Chapman S.W. Nolan R.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) receiving AmB. These are generally seen 1–3 h after the start of the infusion and mimic a “sepsis-like syndrome” characterized by inflammatory cytokine release (4Arning M. Kliche K.O. Heer-Sonderhoff A.H. Wehmeier A. Mycoses. 1995; 38: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). AmB toxicity has provided the impetus for the development of multiple, alternative antifungal drugs, including lipid formulations of AmB, the azoles, and the echinocandins. Despite these alternate therapies, AmB is still widely administered because it is relatively inexpensive, is rapidly fungicidal, has the broadest spectrum of antifungal activity, and rarely induces resistance. AmB dosages of 0.3–1.5 mg/kg/day are commonly administered to patients, resulting in peak AmB plasma concentrations of ∼2 μg/ml (1Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 5th Ed. 1. Churchill Livingstone, Philadelphia2000: 448-459Google Scholar). With extended use, AmB accumulates in the liver, lung, and kidneys, and at these sites, as well as the site of infusion, AmB concentrations may exceed 2 μg/ml. However, at concentrations above 5 μg/ml, AmB is cytotoxic, leaving a narrow therapeutic index for this drug. Nonetheless, after one-half century of clinical use, despite considerable toxicity and discomfort of administration, AmB remains the gold standard for the treatment of many life-threatening fungal infections. AmB stimulates transcription and production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1Ra, IL-1β), chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1β), nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) from murine and human innate immune cells (IC) in vitro (2Cleary J.D. Weisdorf D. Fletcher C.V. Drug Intell. Clin. Pharm. 1988; 22: 769-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 3Cleary J.D. Chapman S.W. Nolan R.L. Antimicrob.

Kliche K.O. Heer-Sonderhoff A.H. Wehmeier A. Mycoses. 1995; 38: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The remarkable similarities between AmB infusion-related toxicities and many of the manifestations of sepsis led us to hypothesize that similar mechanisms could be responsible for both (5Beutler B. Poltorak A. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: S2-S6; discussion S6–S7Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S1-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a family of conserved, mammalian cellular receptors (TLR1-TLR10 in humans and TLR1-TLR9 in mice) (6Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S1-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 7Kimbrell D.A. Beutler B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Microbial products are recognized by TLRs on IC and stimulate inflammatory cytokine release from these cells via TLR-dependent signal transduction. Ligands for TLR2 and TLR4 have been the best studied. Examples of TLR2 ligands include Gram-positive bacteria, peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, and zymosan, whereas TLR4 ligands include LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, Taxol, and Cryptococcus neoformans capsular polysaccharide (6Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S1-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Shoham S. Huang C. Chen J.M. Golenbock D.T. Levitz S.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4620-4626Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors bear homology to the IL-1 receptor and share a similar signaling cascade that activates inflammatory cytokine genes, including TNF-α and IL-8 (6Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S1-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 9Means T.K. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J.

Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, it is presumed that receptor-ligand interactions trigger polymerization of TLRs and result in recruitment of the IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase)-bound adapter protein, MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88). In the case of TLR4-dependent LPS signaling, another protein (Mal/TIRAP) may also serve as an adapter molecule with or in place of MyD88 (12Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In most cases, however, complexation of TLRs, MyD88, and IRAK(s) promotes autophosphorylation of IRAK(s), initiating a signaling cascade resulting in the activation of NF-κB as well as p38 and JNK MAP kinases (6Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S1-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The coordinate effect of NF-κB and MAPK activation enables cytokine gene expression and results in cytokine production and secretion. For example, the interaction of the bacterial product, LPS, specifically with TLR4 and CD14 receptors on IC, induces inflammatory signaling in IC, resulting in cytokine production (13Calandra T. J. Chemother. 2001; 13 (Spec. No.): 173-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Alexander C. Rietschel E.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 167-202PubMed Google Scholar) and many of the manifestations of Gram-negative bacterial sepsis (13Calandra T. J. Chemother. 2001; 13 (Spec. No.): 173-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because AmB is a microbial product that mimics these down-stream events of TLR activation (inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release), we hypothesized that AmB stimulates inflammatory cytokine release from IC via TLR-mediated signal transduction. In many cases, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored co-receptor, CD14, is required for optimal responses to TLR2 and TLR4 agonists, particularly the amphiphilic molecule, LPS (14Alexander C. Rietschel E.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 167-202PubMed Google Scholar). As AmB is also amphiphilic, we postulated that CD14 could be required for AmB to stimulate inflammatory cytokines via TLRs. To address these hypotheses, we performed experiments to determine the dependence of AmB-induced inflammatory responses on TLRs and CD14. As 1) major side effects of AmB include fever and chills; and 2) as these are in part thought to be mediated by TNF-α secretion; and 3) as patients have elevated plasma TNF-α levels in response to AmB intravenous administration, we chose to investigate the TNF-α response following AmB stimulation in cells with varied TLR expression. We analyzed TNF-α production, and in selected cases IL-1β production, following AmB stimulation of peritoneal macrophages (pMϕ) from mice mutated in the adapter protein MyD88, TLR2, TLR4, or CD14. We also examined AmB-dependent induction of an NF-κB-driven reporter gene in the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, overexpressing CD14, as well as IL-8 production and NF-κB-dependent reporter activity in the HEK293 human embryonic kidney cell line transiently transfected with TLRs and/or CD14. We found that TLR2 and CD14, acting through the adapter protein MyD88, are required for AmB-induced NF-κB signal transduction and proinflammatory cytokine release. We found that TLR4 may also function as a signaling receptor for AmB to induce cytokine release. These data demonstrate a receptor-mediated mechanism for the infusion-related toxicity of AmB and specify targets for therapeutic strategies to eliminate these untoward side effects. Reagents—Thioglycollate (Remel, Lenexa, KS), RPMI 1640, Geneticin, l-glutamine and FBS (Invitrogen), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and phosphate-buffered saline (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD), ciprofloxacin I.V. (Bayer Corporation, West Haven, CT), and Hepes buffer (Sigma) were purchased from the indicated manufacturer. Complete media was defined as RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. Stimuli—AmB (Fungizone), of pharmaceutical grade, determined to be endotoxin-free by USP guidelines, and approved for patient use, was purchased from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. This preparation, which contains 50 mg of AmB and 41 mg of deoxycholate buffered with 20.2 mg of phosphate-buffered saline, was reconstituted with 10 ml of endotoxin-free water. In accordance with USP guidelines, the AmB used in our studies was certified by the manufacturer to contain fewer than 0.005 endotoxin units/μg. Using the Pyrochrome assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., Falmouth, MA), we confirmed that our preparation contained fewer than 0.005 endotoxin units/μg of AmB. Using NMR spectroscopic analysis of our preparation, no contaminants were observed in our AmB preparations (data not shown). Liposomal AmB (L-AmB; AmBisome; Fujisawa Healthcare) and AmB lipid complex (ABLC; Abelcet; The Liposome Company) were commercially obtained from the Boston Medical Center Pharmacy (Boston, MA) and were reconstituted as directed by the manufacturer. Deoxycholate (monohydrate sodium salt of deoxycholic acid; DC) was purchased from Sigma, reconstituted with phosphate-buffered saline, and used at concentrations equivalent to deoxycholate concentrations present in AmB. Murine TNF-α and recombinant hIL-1 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Borrelia burgdorferi lysate was prepared as described (15Ma Y. Weis J.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 3843-3853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified peptidoglycan was obtained from Roman Dziarski (11Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Indiana University School of Medicine, Gary, IN). Macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2) was purchased from EMC Microcollections (Tuebingen, Germany). LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4 was purchased from Sigma and repurified via a modified phenol re-extraction technique to yield LPS with only TLR4 agonist activity (16Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H.

All knockout mouse strains used were back-crossed at least five times to the parental C57BL/6 strain. C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeOuJ mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Boston University Laboratory Animal Sciences Center. Peritoneal macrophages were elicited by intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 ml of thioglycollate. Three days after injection, macrophages were harvested, washed with complete media three times, and dispensed into 96-well tissue culture plates at a final concentration of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 2 days of culture, the macrophages were washed with complete media and stimulated for 18 h. Supernatants were then analyzed for cytokine content by ELISA. For experiments comparing CD14 –/– mice with CD14 +/+ mice, peritoneal macrophages were cultured in macrophage serum-free medium (Invitrogen) to avoid stimulation of cells with FBS-derived soluble CD14 (20Yang Z. Breider M.A. Carroll R.C. Miller M.S. Bochsler P.N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All other peritoneal macrophage cultures were in complete media. Cell Lines—The monocytic THP-1 cell lines stably transfected with wild-type human CD14 (THP1-CD14) or with empty vector (THP1-RSV) were a generous gift of R. J. Ulevitch (21Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). THP1-CD14 and THP1-RSV cells were cultured in complete media supplemented with ciprofloxacin, Hepes, l-glutamine, and Geneticin. HEK293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC No. RL-1573, Manassas, VA). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, ciprofloxacin (10 μg/ml), and Geneticin (0.5 μg/ml, for stable cells). Luciferase Assays—THP-1 and HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using DEAE-dextran (22Harrison T.S. Nong S. Levitz S.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 176: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and Polyfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), respectively. Plasmids transfected contained genes coding for the NF-κB-dependent pELAM-luc luciferase reporter (23Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CD14 (26Golenbock D.T. Liu Y. Millham F.H. Freeman M.W. Zoeller R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22055-22059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MD2 (27Schromm A.B. Lien E. Henneke P. Chow J.C. Yoshimura A. Heine H. Latz E. Monks B.G. Schwartz D.A. Miyake K. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 105 THP-1 or 1 × 105 HEK293) were added to 12-well plates, washed after 18 h, and stimulated for 5 h. Cells were then lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) as directed, and lysates were analyzed for luminescence using Promega luciferase substrate and a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Pharmingen). ELISA—Supernatants from peritoneal macrophages or HEK293 cell lines were harvested and stored at –20 °C until use. Sandwich ELISAs were performed on the samples using DuoSet ELISA kits for mouse TNF-α (sensitivity to 15 pg/ml), mouse IL-1-β (sensitivity to 15 pg/ml), and human IL-8 (sensitivity to 10 pg/ml) (R&D Systems) as per the manufacturer's instructions. ELISA plates were read at 450 nm, and data were collected and analyzed using SOFTMAX PRO software (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). MyD88 Is Required for AmB-induced TNF-α Production from Macrophages—TLR signaling in IC generally results in the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases via the adapter protein, MyD88, to stimulate production of the inflammatory mediators TNF-α and IL-8 (28Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). To determine the role of MyD88 in AmB-dependent stimulation of IC, we compared the responses of peritoneal macrophages from normal (C57BL/6 MyD88 +/+) mice with those from mice containing a deletion of the MyD88 gene (C57BL/6 MyD88 –/–). MyD88 –/– macrophages failed to respond to AmB stimulation. In contrast, MyD88 +/+ cells secreted TNF-α in a dose-dependent fashion in response to AmB stimulation (Fig. 1). Deoxycholate (DC), at concentrations present in the AmB suspension, stimulated neither the wild-type nor the null cells. Consistent with previous data, LPS (29Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) stimulated greatly reduced amounts of TNF-α in the null cells, whereas the MyD88-dependent stimulus, peptidoglycan (11Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), did not stimulate detectable TNF-α production from MyD88 –/– cells. These data suggest a role for TLRs, acting through the adapter protein, MyD88, in AmB-stimulated cytokine production. TLR2 Is Required for AmB-induced TNF-α and IL-1β Production from Macrophages—Amphotericin B is a product of the Gram-positive bacterium, S. nodosus. Therefore, we surmised that IC might recognize AmB as they do many other Gram-positive bacterial products, via TLR2 (25Yoshimura A. Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Tuomanen E. Dziarski R. Golenbock D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the responses of C57BL/6 TLR2 –/– peritoneal macrophages with those of C57BL/6 TLR2 +/+ peritoneal macrophages and found that unlike TLR2 +/+ macrophages, TLR2 –/– macrophages did not produce TNF-α in response to AmB stimulation (Fig. 2). In these experiments, the TLR2-dependent stimulus, B. burgdorferi lysate (30Hirschfeld M. Kirschning C.J. Schwandner R. Wesche H. Weis J.H. Wooten R.M. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2382-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stimulated responses only in TLR2 +/+ cells, whereas the TLR2-independent stimulus, LPS (16Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), stimulated similar responses in TLR2 +/+ and TLR2 –/– cells. DC did not stimulate TNF-α production from either cell type. To determine whether AmB induced IL-1β production from elicited peritoneal mouse macrophages, we compared IL-1β production from C57BL/6 TLR2+/+ and C57BL/6 TLR2–/– peritoneal macrophages in response to AmB. TLR2+/+ macrophages produced IL-1β when stimulated with 1, 2, and 4 μg/ml AmB (data not shown). In contrast, TLR2–/– macrophages secreted undetectable amounts of IL-1β in response to AmB stimulation. AmB-induced TNF-α Production from Macrophages Is Partially TLR4-dependent—Due to the similarity between physiologic responses to LPS and AmB, we investigated whether TLR4 (the signaling receptor for LPS) could also act as a signaling receptor for AmB. We examined the TNF-α response of C3H/HeJ (TLR4 mt) peritoneal macrophages that express mutant, non-functional TLR4 (31Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar) in comparison with those of C3H/HeOuJ (TLR4 +/+) mice, which are genetically similar to the C3H/HeJ mice but express wild-type TLR4 (31Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). As such, the TLR4-dependent stimulus, LPS, could only stimulate high levels of TNF-α from the C3H/HeOuJ mice (Fig. 3). In contrast, AmB stimulated similar amounts of TNF-α release from both types of macrophages in response to 2 μg/ml AmB (Fig. 3). The responses of C3H/HeJ macrophages were reduced by 69% (p = 0.021) however, in comparison with those of the C3H/HeOuJ macrophages stimulated with 4 μg/ml AmB. This dose exceeds the peak plasma concentration of AmB generally achieved in patients (∼2.5 μg/ml for AmB-deoxycholate (32Ayestaran A. Lopez R.M. Montoro J.B. Estibalez A. Pou L. Julia A. Lopez A. Pascual B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 609-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bekersky I. Fielding R.M. Dressler D.E. Lee J.W. Buell D.N. Walsh T.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar)) and therefore may not represent a response that is present in most cases in vivo. CD14 Is Required for AmB-induced TNF-α Production from Macrophages—Many TLR2 and TLR4 ligands are dependent on the CD14 co-receptor for optimal TLR activation. To determine the dependence of the TLR signaling response to AmB on CD14, we compared the TNF-α response of peritoneal macrophages from CD14 knockout mice (C57BL/6 CD14 –/–) with those from CD14 wild-type (C57BL/6 CD14+/+) mice. As serum contains soluble CD14 (20Yang Z. Breider M.A. Carroll R.C. Miller M.S. Bochsler P.N. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we performed these experiments using serum-free medium. Macrophages from CD14 –/– mice failed to produce TNF-α when stimulated by AmB (Fig. 4), suggesting that the TLR-dependent response to AmB is also CD14-dependent. As expected, CD14 –/– cells were unable to respond to stimulation with the CD14-dependent stimulus, LPS, whereas the CD14-independent stimulus, IL-1, elicited similar responses in CD14+/+ and CD14 –/– cells. CD14 Overexpression Renders Human Monocytic Cells Responsive to AmB—The THP-1 human monocyte cell line naturally expresses TLR2, TLR4, and very low levels of CD14 (21Pugin J. Kravchenko V.V. Lee J.D. Kline L. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that THP-1 cells stably overexpressing CD14 (THP1-CD14) responded, in a dose-dependant fashion, to AmB stimulation with robust NF-κB-dependent luciferase production, whereas THP-1 cells stably transfected with empty vector (THP1-RSV) did not respond (Fig. 5). Addition of polymyxin B (PB) prior to AmB did not affect AmB-elicited responses, demonstrating that the AmB-dependent NF-κB stimulation of luciferase production was not due to endotoxin contamination (Fig. 5). DC, with or without PB, did not stimulate either cell line. The CD14-dependent stimulus, LPS, induced a response only in cells overexpressing CD14, and this response was inhibited by PB. The CD14-independent stimulus, TNF-α, stimulated similar responses in both cell types, demonstrating that both were able to activate NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Thus, the data with the THP-1 cell lines lend support to our findings with the CD14 knockout mice that CD14 is required for AmB stimulation. TLR2 Expression Renders HEK293 cells Responsive to AmB—HEK293 human embryonic kidney cell lines do not express messages for TLR2, TLR4 (34Hornung V. Rothenfusser S. Britsch S. Krug A. Jahrsdorfer B.

We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with the NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, pELAM-luc, alone (luc) or in combination with a plasmid containing the gene for human TLR2 (luc+TLR2). Cells were then stimulated with either AmB (2 μg/ml) or the TLR2-dependent stimulus B. burgdorferi (Fig. 6a). Only cells transfected with TLR2 responded to AmB and B. burgdorferi with NF-κB-dependent luciferase production. These data provide further support for a role for TLR2 as a signaling receptor for AmB. These experiments do not exclude a requirement for CD14 in addition to TLR2 as HEK cells are able to utilize soluble CD14 from FBS present in cell culture media (23Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T.

HEK293 Cells Expressing TLR2 and CD14 Respond Robustly to AmB—To further examine the role of CD14 in AmB signaling, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with the NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, pELAM-luc (indicated by luc on the figure), plus various combinations of plasmids containing genes for TLR2, CD14, TLR4, and MD2 (Fig. 6b).

Previous studies have shown that exposure to oxidative and nitrative species stabilizes α-synuclein filaments in vitro, and this stabilization may be due to dityrosine cross-linking. To test this hypothesis, we mutated tyrosine residues to phenylalanine and generated recombinant wild type and mutant α-synuclein proteins. α-Synuclein proteins lacking some or all tyrosine residues form fibrils to the same extent as the wild type protein. Tyrosine residues are not required for protein cross-linking or filament stabilization resulting from transition metal-mediated oxidation, because higher M r SDS-resistant oligomers and filaments stable to chaotropic agents are detected using all Tyr → Phe α-synuclein mutants. By contrast, cross-linking resulting from exposure to nitrating agents required the presence of one or more tyrosine residues. Furthermore, tyrosine cross-linking is involved in filament stabilization, because nitrating agent-exposed assembled wild type, but not mutant α-synuclein lacking all tyrosine residues, was stable to chaotropic treatment. In addition, the formation of stable α-synuclein inclusions in intact cells after exposure to oxidizing and nitrating species requires tyrosine residues.

These and other α-syn inclusions contain high molecular weight insoluble α-syn protein that is resistant to strong denaturing conditions, suggesting that α-syn proteins within these inclusions are covalently cross-linked (8Baba M.

However, the precise molecular alterations of α-syn that lead to the formation of pathological inclusions in these diseases remain poorly understood. Recent studies support a role for oxidative and/or nitrative stress in α-syn modification and/or aggregation. For example, our previous work showed that α-syn protein was nitrated in pathological lesions such as LBs and GCIs (23Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). Other studies also demonstrated that nitrating agents such as peroxynitrite/CO2 or myeloperoxidase/H2O2/nitrite can nitrate and oxidize α-syn at tyrosine (Tyr) residues, resulting in the formation of highly stable o,o′-dityrosine oligomers (25Souza J.M.

Significantly, cross-linking, or the formation of covalent bonds between amino acids of the same or different α-syn molecules, of pre-formed α-syn filaments by nitrating agents confers filament stability to chaotropic agents, supporting a role for nitrating agent-induced modifications in the stabilization of α-syn inclusions (25Souza J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18344-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). α-Syn self-oligomerization into an SDS-resistant ladder can also be induced by oxidative agents such as copper and hydrogen peroxide, and this oligomerization appears to be dependent upon the acidic C terminus of the α-syn protein (26Paik S.R. Shin H.J. Lee J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, oxidation by dopamine appeared to inhibit selectively the conversion of protofibrils to fibrils, causing accumulation of the α-syn protofibrils (27Conway K.A. Rochet J.C. Bieganski R.M. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Science. 2001; 294: 1346-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of oxidative versus nitrative species on the aberrant conversion of α-syn from a highly soluble monomeric state to soluble oligomers and finally to insoluble filamentous α-syn inclusions remains unclear (23Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar, 25Souza J.M. Giasson B.I.

Nakamura S. Brain Res. 2002; 938: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because Tyr residues are potential targets of oxidation and we previously showed that all four Tyr residues in α-syn are targets for nitration (25Souza J.M. Giasson B.I. Chen Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18344-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of each of the four Tyr residues (at amino acid positions 39, 125, 133, and 136) in α-syn fibrillization and fibril stabilization under oxidative and/or nitrative conditions. Using WT and Tyr (Tyr → Phe) mutant α-syn recombinant proteins in vitro and stably transfected cultured cells, we showed that the presence of one or more Tyr residues is required for nitrating species-induced α-syn protein cross-linking and filament stabilization. Surprisingly, α-syn protein cross-linking and fibril stabilization induced by transition metal-mediated oxidation does not require Tyr residues in α-syn. These data suggest that independent pathogenic mechanisms are involved in oxidative-versus nitrative-induced α-syn fibrillogenesis. Preparation of Wild Type and Tyr → Phe Mutant Recombinant Human α-Syn Proteins—Human WT α-syn cDNA cloned into the bacterial expression vector pRK172 was mutagenized at Tyr amino acid codons to Phe amino acid codons using specific oligonucleotides containing the corresponding nucleotide substitutions and the site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Single mutant α-syn cDNAs (i.e. Y39F, Y125F, Y133F, Y136F), double mutant α-syn cDNAs (i.e. Y133F,Y136F; Y125F,Y133F; Y125F,Y136F), triple mutant α-syn cDNAs (i.e. Y125F,Y133F,Y136F; Y39F,Y125F,Y133F; Y39F,Y125F,Y136F), and quadruple mutant α-syn cDNA (i.e. Y39F,Y125F,Y133F,Y136F) were generated. The cDNAs encoding WT and mutant α-syn proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RIL cells and purified as described previously (19Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Briefly, sedimented bacterial pellets were dispersed in high-salt lysis buffer (750 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA) by homogenization. The heat stable protein fraction was further purified by Sephadex 200 gel filtration and Mono Q ion exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce), and bovine serum albumin was used as the protein standard. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies LB509, Syn 208, and Syn 204, which are specific for human α-syn (8Baba M. Nakajo S. Tu P.H. Tomita T. Nakaya K. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Iwatsubo T. Am. J.

Lett. 1999; 269: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), as well as monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize nitrated Tyr residues in α-syn were used in this study (23Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Murray I.V. Chen Q. Souza J.M. Hurtig H.I. Ischiropoulos H. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Science. 2000; 290: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). The specificity of the latter antibodies is as follows: nSyn 12 recognizes a complex epitope containing α-syn nitrated at Tyr-125 and Tyr-136; nSyn 14 recognizes α-syn nitrated at Tyr-39; and nSyn 24 recognizes α-syn nitrated at Tyr-125 and Tyr-133. Exposure of α-Syn Proteins to the Nitrating Agent, Peroxynitrite— Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) was synthesized from sodium nitrite and acidified H2O2, and excess H2O2 was removed by treatment with manganese dioxide (31Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of α-syn proteins with ONOO- was carried out as described previously (25Souza J.M. Giasson B.I. Chen Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18344-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Briefly, α-syn proteins were diluted into nitration buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate, 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. The concentration of ONOO- was determined spectrophotometrically at 302 nm in 2 n NaOH (λ302 = 1670 m-1 cm-1). Peroxynitrite was added in 2 boluses of 10-fold molar excess of the protein. After treatment, proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1% SDS, 10% sucrose) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 for quantification by densitometry or analyzed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies directed against WT α-syn and nitrated α-syn followed by incubation with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oxidation of α-Syn Proteins Using Transition Metals and Peroxide— The effects of oxidative damage on α-syn proteins were examined in reaction mixtures of phosphate-buffered saline (137.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.75 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) in the presence of 500 or 50 μm CuCl, CuCl2, FeCl2, or FeCl3 and 300 μm H2O2. Where indicated, reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and prepared for assembly experiments as described below or diluted with SDS sample buffer and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Assembly and Polymerization of α-Syn Proteins—Untreated or ONOO--exposed α-syn proteins at a concentration of 5 mg/ml were exchanged in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.04% sodium azide. Studies involving copper and peroxide oxidation were similarly exchanged into acetate buffer, and the oxidative reagents were added at a final concentration of 500 μm CuCl and 300 μm H2O2. α-Syn proteins were incubated either at 33 °C for 4 days or at 37 °C for 2 days with continuous shaking at 1000 rpm. Each assembly reaction sample was overlaid with 40–50 μl of mineral oil to prevent condensation of samples and hence the alteration of results. Direct Visualization of α-Syn Fibril Formation—For the direct ultrastructural inspection of filament formation, α-syn protein samples were adsorbed to 300-mesh carbon-coated copper grids, stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and visualized with a transmission electron microscope (Joel 1010, Peabody, MA) as described previously (19Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Assessment of α-Syn Polymerization by Centrifugal Sedimentation Analysis—Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min after assembly incubation. Supernatants and pellets were separated, SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min. α-Syn proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and quantified by densitometry. The kinetic consistency of the experimental conditions used for fibril formation was determined by incubating α-syn proteins for varying lengths of time (3 to 96 h) at 37 °C and 1000 rpm using sedimentation analysis in addition to the K114 fluorescence analysis (described below) to confirm that α-syn protein assembly increases over time reproducibly. Assessment of the Formation of Amyloidogenic Polymers Using the K114 Assay—The formation of α-syn amyloidogenic polymers was assessed using a novel amyloid-binding dye (trans,trans)-1-bromo-2,5-bis-(4-hydroxy)styrylbenzene (or K114). K114 recognizes amyloid fibrils in vitro and in pathological inclusions and has distinct fluorescent properties that allow for the monitoring of amyloid fibril formation in solution. 2Crystal, A. S., Giasson, B. I., Crowe, A., Kung, M.-P., Zhuang, Z.-P., Trojanowski, J. Q., and Lee, V. M.-Y. (2003) J. Neurochem., in press. The K114 fluorescence assay was performed by adding 5 μl of each assembly sample (25 μg of α-syn protein) to 100 μl of K114 assay solution (100 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.5, 50 μm K114). Fluorescence was measured using a SpectraMax GeminiXS fluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and SoftMax Pro 4.0 software with a fixed excitation wavelength of 380 nm and a fixed emission wavelength of 550 nm with a cutoff at 530 nm. Filament Stabilization Studies—Following α-syn protein assembly at 37 °C for 3 days with continuous shaking, samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended in nitration buffer and exposed to ONOO- at room temperature or resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 500 μm CuCl and 300 μm H2O2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then diluted into either H2O or 4 m urea, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants and pellets were separated, and samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. α-Syn proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and quantified by densitometry. In Vivo Oxidative/Nitrative Stress Experiments—Human α-syn cDNAs corresponding to the WT or the mutant protein with all four Tyr residues mutated to Phe, i.e. Y39F,Y125F,Y133F,Y136F (referred to as 4(Y → F)), were cloned into the pcDNA 3.1+ mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified medium-high glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2% l-glutamine. Cells were transfected with WT and 4(Y → F) α-syn plasmids by a calcium phosphate precipitation method buffered with BES (32Chen C. Okayama H. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D.-D. Seldman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. Wiley, New York1997: 9.1.7-9.1.11Google Scholar). Stably transfected clones were selected for and maintained in culture medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml geneticin. Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106/well in 35-mm tissue culture plates and exposed to PapaNO (1-propananmine-3-(2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-1-propylhydrazine)) and/or paraquat as described previously (33Paxinou E. Chen Q. Weisse M. Giasson B.I. Norris E.H. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8053-8061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed with warm media and then incubated in 2 ml of media supplemented with 7.5 mm paraquat for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, PapaNO was added at a final concentration of 1.05 mm, and cells were incubated for an additional 1.5 h. Cells plated on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton/phosphate-buffered saline. Cells on coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Syn 208 and Syn 204, rinsed the following morning, and incubated with secondary anti-mouse antibody Alexa 488 fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Coverslips were mounted on slides using Vecta Shield containing 4,6-diamindino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells plated without coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 2% SDS and 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. Samples were boiled with SDS sample buffer, and 7 μg of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with LB509. Role of Tyr Residues in the Fibrillogenesis of α-Syn Proteins—To evaluate the potential role of Tyr residues in α-syn fibril formation, recombinant human α-syn proteins with one to all four of the Tyr residues mutated to Phe were expressed in E. coli and purified (Fig. 1A). The ability of these WT and mutant α-syn proteins to form fibrils was evaluated by several methods. Centrifugal sedimentation analysis was used as a quantitative method to monitor the formation of pelletable α-syn polymers, and this assay has previously been shown to parallel the formation of fibrils (19Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 34Giasson B.I. Murray I.V. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2380-2386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). However, filament formation can be more directly determined by negative staining electron microscopy (EM) (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, the K114 fluorescent assay was used to monitor the formation of amyloidogenic polymers. K114 is a congener of Congo Red with unique fluorescent properties and solubility that allow for the quantitative measurement of amyloid fibril formation in solution. 2Crystal, A. S., Giasson, B. I., Crowe, A., Kung, M.-P., Zhuang, Z.-P., Trojanowski, J. Q., and Lee, V. M.-Y. (2003) J. Neurochem., in press. The formation of amyloid fibrils as measured by K114 fluorescence parallels the formation of sedimentable polymers as well as fibrils observed directly by transmission EM. 2Crystal, A. S., Giasson, B. I., Crowe, A., Kung, M.-P., Zhuang, Z.-P., Trojanowski, J. Q., and Lee, V. M.-Y. (2003) J. Neurochem., in press. Therefore, these three assays compliment each other in assessing and confirming the formation of pelletable amyloidogenic α-syn fibrils. All Tyr → Phe mutant proteins were capable of forming polymers to the same extent as the WT α-syn protein as assessed by sedimentation analysis (Fig. 1, B and C). Kinetic analysis of WT and mutant α-syn assembly using both sedimentation and K114 fluorescence analyses revealed that amyloidogenic polymer formation increased consistently and reproducibly over time, although the 4(Y → F) mutant α-syn protein was slower in forming amyloidogenic fibrils than the WT α-syn protein (Fig. 1D). Shaking at slightly higher temperatures results in a higher percentage (80–90%) of the α-syn monomers converted to fibrils in both WT and mutant proteins (data not shown). Furthermore, direct observation of fibrils by EM examination failed to reveal any significant morphological difference between WT and mutant α-syn fibrils, including width, length, or twisting and turning of the fibrils (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that the hydroxyl functional group on Tyr residues in α-syn proteins is not critical for the assembly of the protein into fibrils under these in vitro conditions. Role of Tyr Residues in the Cross-linking of α-Syn Proteins by Nitrating Agents—Previous data indicated that WT α-syn protein exposed to nitrating agents forms oligomers through dityrosine cross-linking (25Souza J.M. Giasson B.I. Chen Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18344-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). However, the specific Tyr residues involved in the formation of dityrosine cross-linked oligomers have not been identified. To address this question, WT and mutant α-syn proteins were exposed to the nitrating agent, ONOO-, in the presence of CO2. The exposed α-syn proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining (Fig. 2A) or Western blotting using antibodies specific for the different nitrated Tyr residues (Fig. 2B). Exposure of WT, single, double, and triple Tyr → Phe mutant α-syn proteins to ONOO- in the presence of CO2 induces nitration as well as oxidation of Tyr residues to form dityrosine, which results in the formation of SDS-stable dimers and oligomers (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that all four Tyr residues are potential targets for protein nitration as well as for dityrosine cross-linking. As predicted, the mutant α-syn protein that lacks all four Tyr residues (4(Y → F)) neither formed SDS-resistant dimers nor was nitrated after exposure to the nitrating agent (Fig. 2, A and B). Decreasing the number of Tyr residues in the α-syn protein resulted in a reduction in SDS-stable oligomer, yet the presence of a single Tyr residue in the α-syn protein (Y125F,Y133F,Y136F; Y39F,Y133F,Y136F; Y39F,Y125F,Y133F; and Y39F,Y125F,Y136F) is sufficient for the formation of dimers (Fig. 2B). The ability of WT and mutant α-syn proteins to polymerize after exposure to ONOO- in the presence of CO2 was determined by sedimentation analysis (Fig. 2, C and D). The formation of pelletable polymers of WT and mutant α-syn proteins containing at least one intact Tyr residue was inhibited by treatment with ONOO- in the presence of CO2. The lack of α-syn fibrils from samples of ONOO--exposed WT and mutant α-syn proteins containing at least one intact Tyr residue was further confirmed by EM (data not shown), which indicates that the nitration of any Tyr residue can contribute to the prevention of fibril formation. The 4(Y → F) α-syn protein exposed to ONOO- formed some pelletable oligomers (Fig. 2, C and D), but to a lesser extent than unexposed 4(Y → F) α-syn. This result indicates that other protein modifications, in addition to 3-nitrotyrosine, contribute to the inhibition of the polymerization of α-syn protein upon exposure to nitrating agents. Indeed, nitrating agents such as peroxynitrite or nitrogen dioxide are higher oxidation-state species of nitric oxide, formed by chemical reactions of nitric oxide with superoxide or by the one electron oxidation of nitrite by peroxidases and other heme proteins and hydrogen peroxide. Although these reactive nitrogen species primarily nitrate Tyr residues, they are also capable of oxidizing Tyr to form dityrosine cross-linked species. In addition, other amino acid residues, such as cysteine, tryptophan, and histidine could be oxidized. Therefore, exposure of α-syn protein to nitrating agents results in both nitration and some oxidation (25Souza J.M. Giasson B.I. Chen"

It has been reported that Ngb expression levels increase in response to oxygen deprivation and that it protects neurons from hypoxia in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism of this neuroprotection remains unclear. In the present study, we tried to clarify the neuroprotective role of Ngb under oxidative stress in vitro. By surface plasmon resonance, we found that ferric Ngb, which is generated spontaneously as a result of the rapid autoxidation, binds exclusively to the GDP-bound form of the α subunit of heterotrimeric G protein (Gαi). In GDP dissociation assays or guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate binding assays, ferric Ngb behaved as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), inhibiting the rate of exchange of GDP for GTP. The interaction of GDP-bound Gαi with ferric Ngb will liberate Gβγ, leading to protection against neuronal death. In contrast, ferrous ligand-bound Ngb under normoxia did not have GDI activities. Taken together, we propose that human Ngb may be a novel oxidative stress-responsive sensor for signal transduction in the brain.

Globins are iron porphyrin complex (heme)-containing proteins that bind reversibly to oxygen and as such play an important role in respiratory function. They have been found in many taxa including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals (4Hardison R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5675-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The two major globins that have been described in vertebrates are hemoglobin and myoglobin. Hemoglobin (Hb), which consists of four subunits that cooperatively bind oxygen, is present in red blood cells where it is responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues (5Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1983Google Scholar). Myoglobin (Mb) is a monomeric intracellular globin that stores oxygen in muscle tissue and facilitates its diffusion from the periphery of the cell to mitochondria, which use it during oxidative phosphorylation (6Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 857-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Although Ngb shares only 21–25% sequence identity with vertebrate Hb and Mb, it conserves the key amino acid residues that are required for Hb and Mb function (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Like Hb and Mb, Ngb can reversibly bind oxygen (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 7Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30106-30110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The iron atom in the heme prosthetic group of each globin normally exists in either the ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) state. In the absence of exogenous ligands, the ferric and ferrous forms of Ngb are hexacoordinated with the endogenous protein ligands, distal histidine and proximal histidine (7Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Oxygen (O2) or carbon monoxide (CO) can displace the distal histidine of ferrous Ngb to produce ferrous oxygen-bound Ngb (ferrous-O2 Ngb) or ferrous carbon monoxide-bound Ngb (ferrous-CO Ngb) (7Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Hb and Mb are normally hexacoordinated in the ferric state, with a water molecule coordinated to iron and pentacoordinated in the ferrous form, leaving the sixth position empty and available for the binding of exogenous ligands such as O2 and CO. The mammalian brain accounts for up to 20% of the total oxygen consumption, even though it constitutes only 2% of total body weight, and it is the most sensitive organ to the effects of tissue hypoxia (9Ereciñska M. Silver I.A. Respir. Physiol. 2001; 128: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Ngb is widely expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus (CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4, especially in the pyramidal layer), thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 3Zhang C. Wang C. Deng M. Li L. Wang H. Fan M. Xu W. Meng F. Qian L. He F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) of the rat brain. Recently, it has been suggested that Ngb plays a role in the neuronal response to hypoxia and ischemia (11Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 12Sun Y. Jin K. Peel A. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Ngb expression was reported to increase in response to neuronal hypoxia in vitro and focal cerebral ischemia in vivo (11Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 12Sun Y. Jin K. Peel A. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Neuronal survival following hypoxia was reduced by inhibiting Ngb expression with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide and was enhanced by Ngb overexpression, supporting the notion that Ngb protects neurons from hypoxicischemic insults (11Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Moreover, Ngb protected the brain from experimental stroke in vivo (12Sun Y. Jin K. Peel A. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism by which Ngb protects these neurons is by functioning as an O2 carrier, facilitating the diffusion of O2 to the mitochondria within cells that are engaging in active aerobic metabolism, in a manner similar to the way Mb acts in muscle cells. However, Ngb has been estimated to comprise less than 0.01% of the total protein content in the brain (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The low concentration (in the micromolar range) of Ngb in brain tissue perhaps argues against its role in storing and carrying significant amounts of O2. On the other hand, local concentrations of Ngb may reach sufficiently high levels to allow it to regulate local oxygen consumption (10Reuss S. Saaler-Reinhardt S. Weich B. Wystub S. Reuss M.H. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt M. Giessl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Finally, although debatable, the affinity of Ngb for oxygen may be so high as to prevent its release under physiological conditions (7Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8Trent III, J.T. Watts R.A. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30106-30110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which Ngb affords neuroprotection under oxidative stress conditions such as ischemia and reperfusion remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate whether Ngb has novel functions that are related to neuroprotective roles under oxidative stress. On line BLAST searches were performed via the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Conserved Domain Database, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). These analyses revealed that human Ngb has 25–35% amino acid sequence homology with regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) and RGS domains of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) (Fig. 1). The protein that most closely resembles Ngb (24% amino acid identity) is GRK4 (Fig. 1). RGS and GRK proteins are modulators of heterotrimeric G proteins (14Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 15Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc.

Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric G proteins (G proteins) consist of an α subunit (Gα) with GTPase activity and a βγ dimer (Gβγ) and belong to a family of proteins, whose signal transduction function depends on the binding of guanine nucleotides (18Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar, 19Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F.

Ligand- or signal-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) induce GDP release from a Gα subunit, which is followed by the binding of GTP. Binding of GTP to Gα “turns on” the system and causes conformational changes that result in dissociation of the GTP-bound Gα from both the receptor and Gβγ. The GTP-bound Gα and Gβγ can then regulate the activity of different effector molecules, such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase Cβ, and ion channels. Signal transduction is “turned off” by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the Gα protein, which hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP, inducing the reassociation of GDP-bound Gα with Gβγ. The on/off G protein ratio can be regulated by three groups of protein modulators: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which stimulate GDP dissociation and subsequent GTP binding; guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which inhibit GDP dissociation; and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which enhance GTP hydrolysis (18Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar, 19Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F.

GPCRs play a role as functional analogues of GEFs (18Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar, 20Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N.

GRKs phosphorylate agonist-activated forms of GPCRs to induce homologous desentsitization of signaling pathways (14Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 15Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). RGS proteins act as GAPs for Gαi or Gαo and play a role in desensitization (16Zheng B. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Wieland T. Chen C.-K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 14-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the possibility of interaction of Ngb with Gα by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements. Ferric Ngb interacted exclusively with Gαi in their GDP-bound forms. In GDP dissociation assays or GTPγS binding assays, ferric Ngb exhibited GDI activity, inhibiting the rate of exchange of GDP for GTP by Gαi. Since ferrous ligand-bound Ngb under normoxia did not have GDI activities, human Ngb may function as a novel oxidative stress-responsive sensor for signal transduction in the brain. Samples—Rat myristoylated Gα subunits (Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαo; Calbiochem) and bovine Gβγ (Calbiochem) were used. [35S]GTPγS (>1000 Ci/mmol), [8-3H]GDP (10–15 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]GTP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, England). Preparation of Proteins—Amplification of human Ngb cDNA was performed by PCR using human universal Quick-clone cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Human Ngb cDNA was cloned into plasmid PET20b (Novagen, Madison, WI) and was sequenced using an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Overexpression of human Ngb was induced in Escherichia coli strain BL 21 (DE 3) (Novagen) by treatment with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Purification of Ngb without His6-tag was carried out as follows (24Kriegl J.M. Bhattacharyya A.J. Nienhaus K. Deng P. Minkow O. Nienhaus G.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7992-7997Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Soluble cell extract was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Ngb was eluted from the column with buffer containing 75 mm NaCl and was further purified by passage through a Sephacryl S-200 HR gel filtration column. Human Ngb mutants, including a COOH-terminal tag of six histidine residues (His6-tag), were purified on nickel affinity columns (His·Bind® resin; Novagen) from the supernatant of lysed cells using the protocol provided by Novagen. Mass spectrometric measurements of purified Ngbs were performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PerSpective Biosystems Voyager™ DE PRO-S.D., Applied Biosystems), and Edman degradation was carried out on purified Ngbs using a G1005A protein sequencing system (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) at Takara Biomedicals, Inc. to determine their NH2-terminal sequences. Ferric Ngbs were incubated with 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 2 h, and then DTT was removed by chromatography using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Ferrous-CO Ngbs were generated after addition of sodium dithionite and CO gas to the DTT-treated ferric Ngb followed by gel filtration. Site-directed Mutagenesis—A QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to alter cysteine residues (amino acid residues 46, 55, and/or 120) in human Ngb. The point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing FS (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). SPR Experiments—SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore® X Instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). Rat myristoylated Gα subunit (Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, or Gαo) was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip using an amine coupling kit (Biacore) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Activation of the carboxymethylated dextran in the CM5 sensor chip was carried out by mixing equal volumes of 400 mm N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide in water and 100 mm hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide in water, and injecting the mixture into the instrument at 10 μl/min for 7 min. This was followed by the injection of 5 μg/μl Gα protein dissolved in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.5, over the activated surface of the sensor chip for 7 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The unreacted sites of the sensor chip were masked by the injection for 7 min of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. After immobilization, nonspecifically bound protein was removed by washing with running buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4) until the value of the resonance units (RU) became nearly constant. All binding experiments were performed at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Ferric or ferrous-CO Ngb in the running buffer was injected for 5 min, during which association occurred. Dissociation then took place in the running buffer over the next 10 min. The BIAcore response was expressed in relative RU, i.e. the difference in response between flow cell with immobilized protein and the control flow channel. 1000 RU corresponded to 1 ng/mm2 of bound ligand. For binding analyses in the presence of guanine nucleotides, the running buffer containing 5 mm MgSO4 and either 500 μm GDP, or 500 μm GDP plus 500 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF was loaded for 60 min to allow binding of guanine nucleotide to immobilized Gα, after which the samples were injected. After each binding cycle, the sensor chip was regenerated with 5 μl of 0.05% SDS in the running buffer and was washed with running buffer for 5–10 min prior to the next injection. Experimental curves (sensorgrams) were analyzed by means of the BIAevaluation 3.1 software package using the model A + B ⇔ AB to estimate the association and dissociation rate constants ka and kd . GTPγS Binding Assays—100 nm Gαi1 or Gαo was incubated for 3 min at 25 °C in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgSO4 at pH 8.0) with 10 μm GDP in the absence or presence of Ngb (5 μm). Binding assays were initiated with additions of 50 nm [35S]GTPγS (>1000 Ci/mmol). Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn from the binding mixtures and were passed through nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm) (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filters were then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A and were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-6100; Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). The apparent rate constant (k app) values for the binding reactions were calculated by fitting the data to the following equation: GTPγS binding (%) = 100% × (1–e– kt). GDP Dissociation Assays—Gαi1 complexed with [3H]GDP (0.3 μm) was prepared by incubating 0.3 μm Gαi1 with 2 μm [3H]GDP in buffer A for 1.5 h at 25 °C. Excess unlabeled GTP or GDP (200 μm) was added to monitor dissociation of [3H]GDP from Gαi1 in the absence or presence of Ngb (5 μm). Aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times and were passed through nitrocellulose filters (0.45 μm) (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filters were then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A and were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-6100; Aloka). As for preparation of Gαi1 complexed with [α-32P]GDP (1 μm), 1 μm Gαi1 and 2 μm [α-32P]GTP were incubated in buffer A for 1.5 h at 25 °C. Experiments using Gαi1 complexed with [α-32P]GDP were also performed, as described above. SPR Detection of Human Ferric Ngb Binding to Gα—Proteins that interacted with human Ngb were sought by SPR experimentation. SPR is a powerful tool for real time measurement of direct protein-protein interactions that do not require labeling of the proteins. We covalently coupled rat Gαi1, which is highly expressed in the brain (18Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4714) Google Scholar), to a sensor chip. As positive and negative controls we used Gβγ and Mb, respectively, and confirmed that Gβγ interacts with GDP-bound Gαi1, but Mb does not bind to Gαi1 by SPR (see Supplemental Material). Then we characterized the interaction between Ngb and Gαi1 by SPR. A representative sensorgram in Fig. 2A shows that the resonance response reflecting Gαi1-ferric Ngb interaction occurred in an analyte concentration-dependent manner. In the association phase (0∼300 s), the intensity of SPR increased, indicating that ferric Ngb bound to Gαi1 specifically, while in the dissociation phase (300∼900 s), the intensity of SPR decreased, indicating that ferric Ngb dissociated from the immobilized Gαi1. Binding parameters for the interaction of ferric Ngb with Gαi1 were determined to be as follows: association rate constant, ka = 5.0 × 102m–1 s–1; dissociation rate constant, kd = 3.0 × 10–4 s–1; and equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = kd /ka = 6.0 × 102 nm. No significant resonance signals were obtained from sensor chip surfaces that did not have attached ligands (data not shown), indicating an absence of nonspecific interactions between the sensor chip surfaces and analytes. Next we investigated the possibility of interaction of ferrous-O2 Ngb with Gαi. Since ferrous-O2 Ngb is unstable and is converted into ferric Ngb very rapidly due to its autoxidation (7Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), stable ferrous-CO Ngb was used for SPR experiments. As shown in Fig. 2B, the binding affinity of ferrous-CO Ngb to Gαi1 was significantly low (Kd > 1 mm) as compared with that of ferric Ngb. Moreover, further SPR measurements clarified that human ferric Ngb binds to Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαo (K d = 5.8 × 102, 5.5 × 102, and 6.1 × 102 nm, respectively), whereas ferrous-CO Ngb does not bind them (Kd > 1 mm). Ferric Ngb Interacts Exclusively with the GDP-bound Form of Gα—Next we investigated guanine nucleotide dependence of the binding of Gαi1 to Ngb by SPR measurements. As shown in Fig. 2C, ferric Ngb bound to Gαi1, even in the presence of Mg2+ and GDP. The binding parameters (ka = 1.1 × 103m–1 s–1, k d = 6.8 × 10–4 s–1, Kd = 6.0 × 102 nm) were almost the same as those seen in the absence of Mg2+ and GDP. Aluminum tetrafluoride (ALF4-), together with Mg +, can interact with Gαi1-bound GDP and mimic GTP and thereby activate Gαi1 (21Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 22Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+, GDP, and ALF4-, ferric Ngb did not bind to the activated Gαi1 (Fig. 2C). Therefore, human ferric Ngb clearly interacts exclusively with the inactive (GDP-bound) form of Gαi1. Effects of Ngb on GTPγS Binding to Gα—Since our SPR data suggested that human ferric Ngb interacts with GDP-bound Gαi1 but does not interact with activated GTP-bound Gαi1, we hypothesized that Ngb may function as a GEF or GDI for Gαi1. To determine whether ferric Ngb functions as a GEF or a GDI, we performed GTPγS (a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP) binding experiments. Increased GTPγS binding to Gαi1 would imply ferric Ngb is a GEF, whereas decreased binding would imply that ferric Ngb is a GDI. As shown in Fig. 3A, Gαi1 bound GTPγS due to spontaneous guanine nucleotide exchange (k app = 0.081 min–1). In the presence of ferric Ngb, the rate of GTPγS binding to Gαi1 was reduced 6.2-fold (k app = 0.013 min–1) (Fig. 3A), implying that ferric Ngb functions as a GDI for Gαi. On the other hand, ferrous-CO Ngb had no effect on the GTPγS binding (k app = 0.078 min–1) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, ferric Ngb inhibited the rate of GTPγS binding to Gαo by 10-fold; in contrast ferrous-CO Ngb had no effect (k app = 0.040, 0.004, and 0.038 min–1 in the absence and presence of ferric and ferrous-CO Ngb, respectively) (Fig. 3B). These results imply that ferric Ngb is a GDI for Gαo as well as Gαi. Ferric Ngb Acts as a GDI—We then addressed the mechanism by which human ferric Ngb inhibited GTPγS binding to Gαi and Gαo. The inhibition of GTPγS binding to Gαi/o by ferric Ngb may reflect a reduction in the rate of nucleotide exchange. To examine the effects of ferric Ngb on the release of GDP from Gαi1, we measured the rates of GDP dissociation in the absence or presence of ferric Ngb. In the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled GTP, [3H]GDP release from [3H]GDP-bound Gαi1 was inhibited by ferric Ngb (Fig. 4A). The inhibition of GDP dissociation by ferric Ngb suggests that ferric Ngb diminished the rates of spontaneous GTPγS binding to Gαi and Gαo by blocking the GDP release. In other words, ferric Ngb functions as a GDI for Gαi. The most representative GDIs for heterotrimeric G proteins share conserved sequence repeats named the G protein regulatory (GPR) (25Takesono A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5322-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the presence of excess unlabeled GTP, Pcp2 preferentially interacts with the GDP-bound conformation of Gα and serves exclusively as a GDI as does human ferric Ngb (28Natochin M. Gasimov K.G.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the presence of excess unlabeled GDP, Pcp2 was reported to stimulate GDP release from Gαo (27Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To further characterize properties of Ngb as a GDI, we performed GDP dissociation assays in the presence of excess GDP. As shown in Fig. 4B, ferric Ngb stimulated [3H]GDP release from [3H]GDP-bound Gαi1 in the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled GDP, suggesting that the mechanism of ferric Ngb as a GDI is similar to that of Pcp2. Experiments using [α-32P]GDP instead of [3H]GDP also supported these results (data not shown). Functional Analyses of Ngb with an Intra- or Intermolecular Disulfide Bond—Cysteine (Cys) residues are particularly sensitive to oxidation by almost all forms of reactive oxygen species during ischemia and reperfusion (30Eaton P.

These organisms have evolved by producing, among other peculiarities, cold-active enzymes that have the properties to cope with the reduction of chemical reaction rates induced by low temperatures. The emerging picture suggests that these enzymes display a high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures through an improved flexibility of the structural components involved in the catalytic cycle, whereas other protein regions, if not implicated in catalysis, may be even more rigid than their mesophilic counterparts. In return, the increased flexibility leads to a decreased stability of psychrophilic enzymes. In order to gain further advances in the analysis of the activity/flexibility/stability concept, psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic DNA ligases have been compared by three-dimensional-modeling studies, as well as regards their activity, surface hydrophobicity, structural permeability, conformational stabilities, and irreversible thermal unfolding. These data show that the cold-adapted DNA ligase is characterized by an increased activity at low and moderate temperatures, an overall destabilization of the molecular edifice, especially at the active site, and a high conformational flexibility. The opposite trend is observed in the mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts, the latter being characterized by a reduced low temperature activity, high stability and reduced flexibility. These results strongly suggest a complex relationship between activity, flexibility and stability. In addition, they also indicate that in cold-adapted enzymes, the driving force for denaturation is a large entropy change.

In addition, they also indicate that in cold-adapted enzymes, the driving force for denaturation is a large entropy change. The temperature range in which biological activity has been detected extends from –20 °C, the temperature recorded in the brine veins of Arctic or Antarctic sea ice (1Deming J.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), to 113 °C, the temperature at which the archae Pyrolobus fumarii is still able to grow (2Blochl E. Rachel R. Burggraf S. Hafenbradl D. Jannasch H.W. Stetter K.O. Extremophiles. 1997; 1: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Although numerous investigations have been carried out on thermophilic microorganisms and on their molecular components, especially enzymes, the efforts devoted to cold-adapted microorganisms have been comparatively limited despite their tremendous biotechnological (1Deming J.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 3Gerday C. Aittaleb M. Arpigny J.L. Baise E. Chessa J.P. Garsoux G. Petrescu I. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5359-5374Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) applications. Indeed, the biochemical and physiological bases of cold adaptation, which include, for example, regulation of gene expression by low temperatures, membrane adaptation in relation with the homeoviscosity concept, and the activity/stability relationships sustaining the catalytic efficiency of cold-adapted enzymes, are still poorly understood. In permanent cold habitats, low temperatures have constrained psychrophiles to develop among other peculiarities enzymatic tools allowing metabolic rates compatible to life that are close to those of temperate organisms. Thermal compensation in these enzymes is reached, in most cases, through a high catalytic efficiency at low and moderate temperatures (for review, see Ref. 9Smalas A.O. Leiros H.K. Os V. Willassen N.P. Biotechnol. Annu. Rev. 2000; 6: 1-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar and 10Cavicchioli R. Siddiqui K.S. Andrews D. Sowers K.R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2002; 13: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The emerging picture is that this increased catalytic efficiency is attributed to an increase of the plasticity or flexibility of appropriate parts of the molecular structure in order to compensate for the lower thermal energy provided by the low temperature habitat. This plasticity would enable a good complementarity with the substrate at a low energy cost, thus explaining the high specific activity of psychrophilic enzymes. In return, this flexibility would be responsible for the weak thermal stability of cold-adapted enzymes. This relationship between activity, flexibility and stability constitutes a hot topic and represents a central issue in the adaptation of proteins to various environments. Moreover, it is believed that all proteins evolve through a balanced compromise between these features, i.e. structural rigidity allowing the retention of a specific three-dimensional-conformation at the physiological temperature and in contrast flexibility, allowing the protein to perform its catalytic function. In the context of temperature adaptation of enzymes, it is assumed that high temperatures require stable protein structure and activity, whereas high enzyme activity is mandatory at low temperatures. While the common trait of a low conformational stability in cold-adapted enzymes has been demonstrated (see Ref. 11D'Amico S. Claverie P. Collins T. Georlette D. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Meuwis M.A. Feller G. Gerday C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar for review), the stability/flexibility relationship is still controversial since some authors consider that the instability of psychrophilic enzymes is due to a random genetic drift (12Miyazaki K. Wintrode P.L. Grayling R.A. Rubingh D.N. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Moreover, if the decreased stability of cold-adapted enzymes is well documented, there is however, no direct experimental evidence of an increased flexibility. Besides, controversial results were obtained when the flexibility of a few psychrophilic enzymes was investigated by measuring hydrogen-deuterieum exchange rates. In the case of 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (13Svingor A. Kardos J. Hajdu I. Nemeth A. Zavodszky P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28121-28125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), while the psychrophilic and mesophilic enzymes were found more flexible than the thermophilic counterpart, the psychrophile was however more rigid than the mesophile. Nevertheless, in this case, the technique suffered from the disadvantage of being a measure of the accessibility of deeply buried residues, and thus did not detect local flexibility, in particular that associated with the active site which is generally quite accessible. Using a similar technique, Fields (14Fields P.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 129: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) showed that while a psychrophilic and a mesophilic lactate dehydrogenases had similar flexibility at 2 °C, the global flexibility of the psychrophile was significantly larger at 23 °C. In addition to the lack of data about the flexibility of cold-adapted enzymes, information on the thermodynamics of inactivation and unfolding is also missing and the few available reports are controversial. Indeed, Siddiqui et al. (15Siddiqui K.S. Cavicchioli R. Thomas T. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) proposed that the thermolability of psychrophilic enzymes is due to enthalpic effects, while others (16Ciardiello M.A. Camardella L. Carratore V. di Prisco G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Collins T. Meuwis M.A. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18D'Amico S. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7891-7896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) found this to be entropically driven. Further studies are thus required to resolve whether an unfavorable entropic or enthalpic contribution determines the irreversible unfolding and inactivation of these enzymes. In attempt to elucidate how stability, catalytic activity, and conformational flexibility are connected in psychrophilic enzymes, we have investigated three structurally homologous NAD+-dependent DNA ligases. The psychrophilic DNA ligase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (Phlig) 1The abbreviations used are: Phlig; P. haloplanktis DNA ligase; FI, fluorescence intensity; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; Eclig, E. coli DNA ligase; Tslig, T. scotoductus DNA ligase; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. has been overexpressed and characterized (19Georlette D. Jonsson Z.O. Van Petegem F. Chessa J.-P. Van Beeumen J. Hubscher U. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3502-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), high-lighting an increased catalytic efficiency as well as an increased thermolability of the enzyme. Cold adaptation of Phlig is believed to be due to a decreased level of arginine and proline residues, as well as an overall destabilization of its N-terminal domain (19Georlette D. Jonsson Z.O. Van Petegem F. Chessa J.-P. Van Beeumen J. Hubscher U. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3502-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mesophilic reference chosen is the DNA ligase form Escherichia coli (Eclig) (20Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the thermophilic homologue is the Thermus scotoductus DNA ligase (Tslig) (21Thorbjarnardóttir S.H. Jónsson Z.O. Andresson O.S. Kristjánsson J.K. Eggertsson G. Pálsdóttir A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The three enzymes are of a similar size, share all the properties common to NAD+-dependent DNA ligases, but are adapted to different extremes of the temperature scale (19Georlette D. Jonsson Z.O. Van Petegem F. Chessa J.-P. Van Beeumen J. Hubscher U. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3502-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), therefore constituting an adequate series of homologous enzymes for temperature adaptation studies. In the present work, the overall destabilization of Phlig is examined with the help of three-dimensional modeling and investigation of solvent-exposed hydrophobic clusters. In addition, the intricate relationship between activity, flexibility and stability in Phlig is analyzed by comparison of its temperature dependent activity, conformational flexibility, and thermal and chemical stabilities with its mesophilic and thermophilic counterpart Eclig and Tslig, respectively. Three-dimensional Modeling—The target sequences for modeling are the NAD+-dependent DNA ligases from P. haloplanktis, E. coli, and T. scotoductus. The best template for the three proteins was 1DGS.A, the homologue NAD+-DNA ligase of T. filiformis (22Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The modeling, minimizations and molecular dynamics procedures were described elsewhere. 2D. Georlette, V. Blaise, F. Bouillenne, B. Damien, S. H. Thorbjarnardottir, E. Depiereux, C. Gerday, V. N. Uversky, and G. Feller, submitted manuscript. The equilibrium temperatures chosen, known as the optimal organism temperature, were 277, 310, and 354 K, for P. haloplanktis, E. coli, and T. scotoductus, respectively. Protein Preparation and Assays—The recombinant cold-adapted NAD+-dependent DNA ligase (Phlig) was overexpressed at 18 °C in E. coli BL21(DE3) as previously described (19Georlette D. Jonsson Z.O. Van Petegem F. Chessa J.-P. Van Beeumen J. Hubscher U. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3502-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except that the growth was performed in TB medium (12 g/liter tryptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 4 ml/liter glycerol, 12.54 g/liter K2HPO4, 2.32 g/liter KH2PO4, pH 7) containing 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin, and that induction was performed when OD600 reached ∼4. The cold His-tagged enzyme was then purified by Ni2+-Hitrap Chelating followed by thrombin digestion, second Ni2+-Hitrap Chelating to separate untagged protein from the undigested ligase, and Mono Q HR 5/5, as described previously (19Georlette D. Jonsson Z.O. Van Petegem F. Chessa J.-P. Van Beeumen J. Hubscher U. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3502-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding E. coli DNA ligase was a generous gift from V. Sriskanda and S. Shuman (20Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pET-EcoLIG plasmid (20Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was digested with NdeI and BamHI and the insert cloned into pET23a plasmid, leading to the overexpression of an untagged protein. The recombinant Eclig was overexpressed at 37 °C in E. coli BL21(DE3) as previously described (20Sriskanda V. Schwer B. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3953-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), except that the growth was performed in TB-ampicillin medium containing 100 μg ml–1 ampicillin, and that induction was performed when OD600 reached ∼3. The mesophilic protein was purified according to a protocol established for T. scotoductus DNA ligase (Tslig) (23Hernandez G. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. LeMaster D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3166-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), except that the heatings treatments were replaced by a DEAE-agarose column chromatography. Plasmid encoding Tslig was a kind gift from Z. O. Jónsson and G. Eggertsson (Reykjavik, Iceland) (21Thorbjarnardóttir S.H. Jónsson Z.O. Andresson O.S. Kristjánsson J.K. Eggertsson G. Pálsdóttir A. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 161: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The recombinant wild-type Tslig was overexpressed and purified by two successive heatings (65 and 80 °C), followed by Hi-Trap Heparin and Mono Q HR chromatographic steps, as described (23Hernandez G. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. LeMaster D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3166-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as standard. The final yield was ∼100 mg, ∼250 mg, and ∼55 mg per liter of culture for Phlig, Eclig, and Tslig respectively. N-terminal sequencing confirmed the integrity of recombinant proteins. Enzyme activity was determined using a fluorimetric assay, as described previously (19Georlette D. Jonsson Z.O. Van Petegem F. Chessa J.-P. Van Beeumen J. Hubscher U. Gerday C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3502-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Adenylation Assays—In order to compare DNA ligases in a similar adenylation state, enzyme stock solutions were adenylated by adding an excess of β-NAD+ (24Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The ratio [NAD+]/[DNA ligase] was ∼80. The adenylated mixtures were then incubated at 10 °C (Phlig), 25 °C (Eclig), and 65 °C (Tslig) for 30 min and then cooled rapidly on ice. Protein solutions were dialyzed against appropriate buffer before experiments. Fluorescence Measurements—Both intrinsic and ANS fluorescence measurements were recorded on an Aminco SLM 8100 spectrofluorimeter. Thermal denaturation (scan rate 1 °C/min) of the DNA ligases was monitored by recording the fluorescence intensity change at 330 nm, using a protein concentration of 50 μg/ml (0.66 μm) in 20 mm phosphate sodium, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, with excitation at 280 nm (2-nm band pass) and emission at 330 nm (4-nm band pass). Data were normalized using the pre- and post-transition baseline slopes as described (25Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) and were fit according to a three-state model (26Vanhove M. Guillaume G. Ledent P. Richards J.H. Pain R.H. Frere J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ANS fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C except for Phlig (15 °C), using a protein concentration of 25 μg/ml (0.33 μm) in 20 mm phosphate sodium, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, with excitation at 390 nm (2-nm band pass), and emission (4-nm band pass) spectra recorded from 420 to 600 nm (scan speed 350 nm min–1). The fluorescence spectra were corrected for the background fluorescence of ANS. The ratio [ANS]/[ligase] was ∼200 using ϵ350nm = 4950 m–1 cm–1 for ANS. Thermal unfolding of samples containing ANS was performed at a scan rate of 1 °C/min. In this case, the recorded fluorescence spectra were corrected for the background fluorescence of ANS at the corresponding temperature. Dynamic Quenching of Fluorescence—The conformational resiliences of Phlig, Eclig, and Tslig were characterized by acrylamide-induced fluorescence quenching. Samples were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, and the protein concentrations (∼50 μg/ml) were adjusted to provide an optical density at the excitation wavelength less than 0.1. Aliquots of a 1.2 m acrylamide stock solution were consecutively added to 1 ml protein solution in order to increase acrylamide concentration by ∼5 mm steps. Experiments were performed on an Aminco SLM 8100 spectrofluorimeter at 10 and 25 °C, using excitation at 280 nm with fluorescence emission set at 330 nm (excitation and emission slit widths were 1 and 4, respectively) and the fluorescence intensities were recorded for 30 s. Data, that are the mean of three experiments, were corrected for the dilution effects and for the absorptive screening caused by acrylamide (ϵ280nm = 4.3 m–1 cm–1 for acrylamide). Quenching data were plotted as the ratio of fluorescence in the absence of quencher (F0) to the intensity in the presence of quencher (F) against quencher concentration. The resulting data were fit to dynamic parameters according to the Stern-Volmer relation shown in Equation 1, F0/F=1+KSV[Q](Eq. 1) where KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant and [Q] the quencher concentration (27Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 257-301Crossref Google Scholar). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Measurements were performed using a MicroCal MCS-DSC instrument as detailed (28Feller G. d'Amico D. Gerday C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4613-4619Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Samples were dialyzed overnight against 30 mm MOPS, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.6. In order to decrease aggregation, a non-detergent sulfobetaine (3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propane sulfonate) was added prior to DSC experiment (29Goldberg M.E. Expert-Bezançon N. Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Fold. Des. 1995; 1: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), to a final concentration of 0.5 m for Phlig and Eclig, and 0.75 m for Tslig. Protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce), and was ∼4 mg/ml except for Phlig (∼7 mg/ml). Thermograms were analyzed according to a non-two-state model in which Tm , ΔHcal , and ΔHeff of individual transitions are fitted independently using the MicroCal Origin software (version 2.9). The magnitude and source of the errors in the Tm and enthalpies values have been discussed elsewhere (30Matouschek A. Matthews J.M. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fitting standard errors on a series of three DSC measurements made under the same conditions in the present study were found to be ± 0.1 K on Tm and ±4% on both enthalpies. All scans were found to be irreversible under the experimental conditions used for these studies. Kinetically driven unfolding was recorded at two different scan rates (0.4 and 1 K min–1 for Phlig, and 1 and 2 K min–1 for Eclig), and the rate constant kdenat was calculated from the relation shown in Equation 2 (31Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), k=vCp/(ΔHcal-Q)(Eq. 2) where v represents the scan rate (K min–1), Cp the excess heat capacity at a given temperature, ΔHcal the total heat of the process, and Q the heat evolved at the given temperature. GdmCl-induced Unfolding—Approximately 25 μg/ml (A 280nm < 0.1) protein samples in 50 mm phosphate sodium, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, were incubated overnight at 25 °C (18 °C for the cold-adapted Phlig), in defined guanidine hydrochoride (GdmCl) concentrations, and unfolding was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence analysis. The pH was checked to ensure a constant value throughout the whole transition, and the denaturant concentration was determined from refractive index measurements (25Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar) using a R5000 hand refractometer from Atago. Relative fluorescence was measured on an Aminco SLM 8100 spectrofluorimeter at 25 °C, except for Phlig (18 °C), at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (2-nm band pass) and at an emission wavelength of 330 nm (4-nm band pass), except Tslig (λ em 333 nm). Unfolding of the three DNA ligases Phlig, Eclig, and Tslig was fully reversible since they regained native conformation following renaturation after complete denaturation in 7 m GdmCl. Fluorescence spectroscopy data were normalized using the pre- and post-transition baseline slopes as described (25Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). The transition curves obtained were analyzed using a three-state model (N↔I↔U) (26Vanhove M. Guillaume G. Ledent P. Richards J.H. Pain R.H. Frere J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Determination of Activation Parameters—Thermodynamic parameters of activation were calculated as described (32Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), using Equations 3, 4, 5, ΔG#=RT×lnkBTh-lnk(Eq. 3) ΔH#=Ea-RT(Eq. 4) ΔS#=(ΔH#-ΔG#)/T(Eq. 5) where kB is the Boltzmann constant (1.3805 10–23 J K–1), h the Planck constant (6.6256 10–34 J s), k (s–1) the rate constant at temperature T (K), Ea the activation energy of the reaction, and R (8.314 J mol–1 K–1) the gas constant. Molecular Model of Adenylated Phlig, Eclig, and Tslig—The amino acid sequences of Phlig, Eclig, and Tslig show 45, 45, and 87% identity with T. filiformis (Tflig) DNA ligase, allowing us to build three-dimensional models from the known x-ray structure (Fig. 1, B–D). The final models of Phlig, Eclig, and Tslig can be superimposed, showing a strong conservation of the active site architecture, of the main secondary structures, and of the overall fold. These monomeric enzymes are folded into four discrete domains characterizing NAD+-dependent DNA ligases (22Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and E), i.e. Domain 1 (containing Ia and adenylation subdomains), Domain 2 (OB-fold domain), Domain 3 (Zn-finger and HhH subdomains), and Domain 4 (BRCT or BRCA C-terminal-related domain). As shown for Tf DNA ligase (22Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the circular arrangement of the four domains leads to a hole sufficiently large to hold a double-stranded DNA. Sequence alignment reveals that the psychrophilic DNA ligase contains all the conserved boxes that have previously been described in eubacterial DNA ligases (Fig. 1E). Moreover, the recent determination of the structure of Tflig (22Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.K. Kwon S.T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), as well as the investigation of Domain Ia of Eclig (33Sriskanda V. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9695-9700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have pointed out essential residues implicated in catalysis, that appear to be conserved among NAD+-dependent DNA ligases adapted to different temperatures. To further characterize the active site of the psychrophilic enzyme, the number as well as the surface of positively charged, negatively charged, neutral, and nonpolar amino acids of the adenylation domain were determined (Table I). The main trend is a decrease in the number and mainly in the accessible surface of neutral side chains form Phlig to Eclig and Tslig. This is accompanied by a decrease of the accessible surface of nonpolar side chains and an increase of the accessible charged surfaces. As a result, the active site of the psychrophilic ligase is characterized by an excess of hydrophobic surfaces and reduced charged surfaces when compared with the adenylation domain of the thermophilic enzyme. A similar trend is observed when the whole molecule is analyzed (Table II). As shown in Table II, the psychrophilic enzyme displays an increased exposure of hydrophobic residues to the solvent, whereas the thermophilic DNA ligase shows an increased hydrophilic accessible surface area, including an increase of the charged accessible surface. Such discrepancies probably lead to improved electrostatic interactions in the thermophilic ligase that are likely to stabilize the enzyme at high temperatures, whereas the excess of hydrophobic surfaces in Phlig represents an entropy-driven destabilizing factor.Table IComposition and surface accessibility of the active site (adenylation domain) of Phlig, Eclig, and TsligPhligEcligTsligCompositionNumber of amino acids (aa) forming the active site248248246Number of positively charged aa (basic)37 (15%)36 (14%)42 (17%)Number of negatively charged aa (acidic)35 (14%)33 (13%)39 (15%)Number of neutral aa52 (21%)45 (18%)36 (14%)Number of nonpolar aa124 (50%)134 (54%)129 (52%)Surface accessibility (Å2)Recalculated accessible surface143751357513888Surface of positively charged aa (basic)4339 (30%)4329 (31%)5629 (40%)Surface of negatively charged aa (acidic)2579 (18%)2510 (18%)3220 (23%)Surface of neutral aa2911 (20%)2519 (18%)1312 (9%)Surface of nonpolar aa4546 (32%)4217 (31%)3727 (26%) Open table in a new tab Table IIComposition of the accessible surface of Phlig, Eclig, and TsligPhligEcligTsligSurface accessibility (Å2)Recalculated accessible surface361833608536626Neutral accessible surface3254 (9%)2362 (7%)2269 (6%)Hydrophobic accessible surface7994 (22%)6468 (18%)6270 (17%)Hydrophilic accessible surface24935 (69%)27255 (75%)28087 (77%)positively charged9202 (25%)11800 (33%)13129 (36%)negatively charged7184 (20%)9187 (25%)8834 (24%) Open table in a new tab ANS Fluorescence—It is well known that the interaction of hydrophobic fluorescent probes such as 8-anilino-1-naphtalenesulfonic acid (ANS) with the exposed hydrophobic sites on the surface of native protein results in a considerable increase of the dye fluorescence intensity and a blue shift of its fluorescence spectrum (34Stryer L.

This strict specificity is unusual among lysosomal enzymes (2Turk B. Turk D. Turk V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of this enzyme in mammals followed earlier identification of similar enzymes (initially termed “vacuolar processing enzyme” or VPE) in plants (3Shutov A.D. Do N.L. Vaintraub I.A.

Parasitology. 1995; 111: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). AEP/legumain is unrelated to the papain-like C1 family of lysosomal cysteine proteases such as cathepsins S, B, L, and H but has features that suggest an evolutionary relationship to the caspases, the bacterial proteases gingipain and clostripain, and separase (8Uhlmann F.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 441 (365): 461Google Scholar). AEP is expressed in diverse cell types, and in most cases its functions are still unknown. AEP has emerged as an important enzyme in antigen and autoantigen processing, targeting selected asparagine residues in tetanus toxin, myelin basic protein, and other antigens (10Manoury B.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 3726-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the case of the tetanus toxin C fragment, AEP introduces a small number of cleavages that “unlock” the folded protein substrate, making it available for class II MHC binding and, potentially, additional protease action (11Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Lennon-Dumenil A.M. Bakker A.H. Wolf-Bryant P. Ploegh H.L.

In contrast, we have shown that AEP action on myelin basic protein can destroy a T cell epitope, preventing its display on class II MHC molecules and possibly the elimination of autoreactive T cells specific for this epitope (12Manoury B. Mazzeo D. Fugger L. Viner N. Ponsford M. Streeter H. Mazza G. Wraith D.C. Watts C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). AEP can initiate processing of the invariant chain, although this key event in class II MHC maturation can also be performed by other enzymes (16Manoury B. Mazzeo D. Li D.N. Billson J. Loak K. Benaroch P. Watts C Immunity. 2003; 18: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). AEP/legumain has also been implicated in the activation of pro-gelatinase A (17Chen J.M. Fortunato M. Stevens R.A. Barrett A.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 777-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in α-thymosin processing (18Sarandeses C.S. Covelo G. Diaz-Jullien C. Freire M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and as an inhibitor of osteoclast formation (19Choi S.J. Reddy S.V. Devlin R.D. Menaa C. Chung H. Boyce B.F. Roodman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27747-27753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Very recently, analysis of mice deficient in AEP demonstrated an accumulation of the single chain forms of cathepsins H, B, and L, changes in the activities of several lysosomal exopeptidases, and age-dependent perturbation of kidney proximal tubule lysosome function (20Shirahama-Noda K. Yamamoto A. Sugihara K. Hashimoto N. Asano M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. J. Biol. Chem. May 29, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M302742200)PubMed Google Scholar). Thus AEP is emerging as a lysosomal enzyme whose specificity makes it ideal for the limited cleavages necessary for pro-protein processing and antigen presentation. How AEP is itself activated is of some interest because this may in turn control the activation/processing of downstream substrates including other lysosomal proteases. Like several members of the papain family of lysosomal cysteine proteases, activation of AEP is triggered by acidic pH and appears to be autocatalytic (21Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Caffrey C.R. Mathieu M.A. Gaffney A.M. Salter J.P. Sajid M. Lucas K.D. Franklin C. Bogyo M. McKerrow J.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the case of the Arabidopsis enzyme (γVPE), Kuroyanagi et al. (21Kuroyanagi M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have shown that sequential removal of C- and N-terminal propeptides by cleavage after Asn occurs, although removal of the N-terminal peptide was not necessary for activity. Other plant VPEs may autoactivate through cleavages after aspartic acid (22Hiraiwa N. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, somewhat incomplete and conflicting data have appeared regarding the mechanism of autoactivation of mammalian AEP. One report documented autoactivation of an AEP-Ig fusion protein following cleavage after one or more aspartic acid residues (24Halfon S. Patel S. Vega F. Zurawski S. Zurawski G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Another study, which followed the activation of pro-AEP in cell lysates, reported an obligatory cleavage after asparagine 323 leading to enzyme activation (25Chen J.M. Fortunato M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 327-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we analyze the autoactivation pathway of pro-AEP in vitro and in vivo. We show that sequential cleavages after both asparagine and aspartic acid are necessary for efficient enzyme activation resulting in the removal of a 110-residue C-terminal and a short 8-residue N-terminal pro-peptide, respectively. The key activating cleavage at Asp25 only occurs below pH 5.0 and yields active enzyme, which is, however, still significantly larger than the final cellular form of AEP. The fully mature form is generated by living cells either from endogenous pro-AEP or following endocytosis and cellular processing of recombinant pro-AEP. AEP biosynthesis is induced as blood monocytes are differentiated into dendritic cells, but only partial activation occurs. Maturation with LPS triggers the appearance of fully mature and active enzyme. This multi-step, pH-regulated activation pathway may therefore be used to control processing capacity for antigens and other AEP substrates. Cloning and Expression of the AEP Precursor—Total RNA was prepared from the EBV B cell line 4.2 (26Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1985; 314: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) using RNAzol according to the manufacturer's conditions and used as template for reverse transcription-PCR. Specific AEP cDNA was generated using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and the reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAGCTTTCAGTAGTGACCAAGGCACAC-3′ and subsequently amplified using forward primer 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGTTTGGAAAGTAGCTGTATTCCTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAGCTTTCAGTAGTGACCAAGGCACAC-3′ under the following PCR conditions: 1 cycle of 95 °C for 2 min; 15 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s (decreasing by 1 °C/cycle), and 68 °C for 3 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min (+10 s/cycle); and 1 cycle of 68 °C for 10 min. AEP cDNA was gel-extracted and ligated using T4 DNA ligase into pCR3 vector (Invitrogen) using the XhoI and EcoR1 restriction sites underlined in the above primers. To generate a suitable vector for methotrexate-driven AEP overexpression the AEP insert was reamplified to include an optimal Kozak sequence at the 5′ end and a His6 C-terminal tag using forward primer 1 (5′-ACGATATCACCATGGTTTGGAAAGTAGCTGTATTCC-3′) and reverse primer 1 (5′-ATCTAGAGAATTCGCGGCCGCTCAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTAGTGACCAAGGCACACGTG-3′). The product was cloned into the EcoRV and NotI sites (underlined in primers) of vector pcDNA DHFR (27Ding S. Yao D. Burchell B. Wolf C.R. Friedberg T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to generate the AEP expression vector pDT1. DHFR- CHO cells (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, UK) were transfected using the calcium phosphate method, and colonies were initially selected in Iscove's medium lacking thymidine and hypoxanthine plus dialyzed fetal calf serum. After ∼2 weeks the surviving colonies were subjected to further selection in 20 nm methotrexate followed by stepwise increases to 100 nm, 500 nm, and finally 1 μm. Single colonies were picked at 100 nm. The conditioned medium (5 μl) and cell lysates (15 μg) were screened by Western blotting using an anti-human AEP antibody raised in sheep (10Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). More than 20 overproducing cell lines were isolated in this way. For most experiments we used clones 2C3 or 3A5. We estimated up to 70-fold overexpression of active AEP within the cells and up to 10-20 mg/liter of AEP precursor secreted into the growth medium (see Fig. 1). For production of the AEP precursor, the overproducing cells were adapted to CHO-S-SFMII serum-free medium (Invitrogen) by progressive reduction in the level of fetal calf serum (10%, 5%, 2.5%, 1%, and then 0%) with each step taking about 1 week. To purify the AEP precursor, up to 1 liter of medium, conditioned by cell growth for approximately 1 week, was adjusted to 1 m NaCl and passed over a nickel-agarose column. The column was washed with Tris, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole. The AEP precursor was eluted in the same buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and stored at -20 °C in 20% glycerol. AEP Autoactivation and Assay Conditions—Autoactivation of AEP was performed by diluting aliquots of the 56-kDa AEP precursor into a buffer containing 0.2 m sodium citrate/citric acid plus 1 mm dithiothreitol adjusted to different pH values. After different time periods at 37 °C, AEP enzyme activity was assessed by transferring aliquots of the autoactivation reaction to AEP assay buffer (28Johansen H.T. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which included 10 μm Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-NHMec as substrate. Release of NHMec was measured using a Cytofluor plate reader. Note that the pH of the assay buffer (pH 5.8) is optimal for AEP activity measurement but prevents autoactivation, which requires lower pH values. AEP autocatalytic cleavage sites were identified following transfer of 56-, 47-, 46-, and 11-kDa products to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by eight cycles of Edman degradation in an ABI sequencer. The N-terminal propeptide VPIDDPED and its variant forms (synthesized by Dr. G. Bloomberg, Bristol University) were dissolved in water to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml, and the pH was adjusted by the addition of 2 m NaOH. Different concentrations were tested either on preactivated 46-kDa AEP or for their ability to inhibit the autoactivation of 56-kDa AEP. For the inhibition of autoactivation experiments, the 56-kDa AEP protein was incubated at pH 4.0 at a concentration of 0.5 mg·ml-1 in the presence of the reversible inhibitor Fmoc-AENK-amide or a control peptide, Fmoc-AEQK-amide. The autoactivation reaction was stopped by diluting into pH 5.8 buffer and further diluted into assay buffer for measurement of AEP enzyme activity. The final concentration of inhibitor peptide in the assay buffer was 2.3 μm, i.e. less than 10% that of the Z-Ala-Ala-NHMec substrate, which was adjusted to 25 μm. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of Asp21 and Asp25 to alanine in pro-AEP was performed by PCR using forward primer 1 (see above) and mutagenic reverse primers that incorporated a unique DraIII site (underlined) located immediately downstream of the Asp25 codon: Reverse 2, 5′-GATCACCACCCAGTGCTTGCCTCCATCTTCAGGATCAGCTATAGGAAC-3′ changing Asp21 to Ala; Reverse 3, 5′-GATCACCACCCAGTGCTTGCCTCCAGCTTCAGGATCATCTATAGGAAC-3′ changing Asp25 to Ala25; and Reverse 4, 5′-GATCACCACCCAGTGCTTGCCTCCAGCTTCAGGATCAGCTATAGGAAC-3′ changing both Asp21 and Asp25 to Ala. The PCR products were introduced into pDT1 by fragment exchange utilizing EcoRV and DraIII restriction sites. Substitution of Cys189 and of Asn323 with Ser and Ala, respectively, was achieved using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All of the constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. Expression of Mutant AEPs—The AEP mutants were expressed in 293T cells by transient transfection using Ca2+-phosphate. After 17-20 h the medium was replaced with fresh medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm Hepes, 10% fetal calf serum). Two days later the serum level was reduced to 5%, and medium was collected after 3-5 days. AEP mutants were purified by nickel-agarose chromatography as described above. Autoactivation conditions were as above at pH 4.0 or pH 4.5 for 2-5 h. Antibodies—Antisera production was performed under contract with Diagnostics Scotland (Carluke). Sheep and mice were immunized with a mixture of 56-kDa AEP precursor and fully autoactivated 46-kDa AEP. Rabbits were immunized with the N-terminal peptide VPIDDPEDGGKHWV coupled through a C-terminal cysteine residue to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. After two successive boosts, both the rabbit and sheep antibodies were affinity purified on the same peptide coupled to Sulfolink gel (Pierce). The sheep antibodies were subjected to repeated rounds (four in all) of purification until the reactivity to activated forms of AEP was removed. This antibody is named αAEP18-31. Sheep antibodies were also affinity purified on immobilized 56-kDa AEP. Murine monoclonal antibodies were obtained by standard methods, screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy and were recloned twice. Radiolabeling of 56-kDa AEP and [35S]Met/Cys Pulse-Chase Labeling—Purified 56-kDa AEP precursor (6-10 μg) was radioiodinated in a final volume of 20 μl of 0.25 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2 containing 0.5 mCi of 125I. After 15 min the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 20 mm tyramine and 5 μl of 1 m KI. The labeled protein was isolated by chromatography on a 10-ml PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). To detect uptake of 125I-AEP by wild type CHO cells, 106 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates, and 0.2 μg/ml 125I-AEP was added in a final volume of 2 ml complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Where indicated, inhibitors were added 1 h before the addition of 125I-AEP. After different times the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, detached with phosphate-buffered saline with 10 mm EDTA, and collected by centrifugation. After two more washes, the cells were lysed in AEP assay buffer (28Johansen H.T. Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but containing 1% CHAPS, 0.5% Triton instead of 0.1% CHAPS. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In some experiments, labeled AEP was immunoprecipitated from postnuclear supernatants with affinity-purified antisera raised either in sheep or in rabbits. For [35S]Met/Cys labeling, the 3A5 overproducing cell line was preincubated in RPMI 1640 lacking methionine and cysteine plus 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 1 h. 5 × 106 cells were labeled with 0.25 mCi of [35S]Met/Cys (Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min. The medium was removed, and after washing the cells were chased in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium including 5 mm methionine. After different times the cells were washed and lysed at 0 °C in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2 plus protease inhibitors (Complete mixture; Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation to remove nuclei, labeled AEP was immunoprecipitated as above and analyzed on 12% Bis-Tris gels (NuPAGE; Invitrogen). Dendritic Cell (DC) Culture—Blood from healthy donors was used to prepare peripheral blood monocytic cells. CD14+ monocytes were isolated with magnetic beads (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer's protocol and cultured at 4 × 105/ml with 800 units/ml granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Leucomax, Sandoz) plus 1000 units/ml interleukin-4 (BD Biosciences) essentially according to the protocol of Sallusto and Lanzavecchia (29Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar). DCs were CD1a-positive, and expression of CD86 and class II MHC increased following LPS-driven maturation (1 μg/ml; Sigma). Microscopy—MelJuSo-SD1 cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and cultured overnight before fixing in 3% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 and after preblocking with 0.2% fish skin gelatin, stained with sheep anti-AEP, sheep anti-AEP18-31, mouse anti-AEP monoclonal antibodies 6E3 and 11B7, anti-LAMP-1 (Pharmingen), or combinations thereof. Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-sheep AlexaFluor 488 or donkey anti-mouse AlexaFluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. Production and Purification of Homogenous AEP Proenzyme—To resolve some of the issues concerning the autoactivation of asparaginyl endopeptidase, we developed an expression system that permitted the purification of large amounts of the proenzyme. We took advantage of the potential that gene amplification offers in CHO cells for protein overproduction (30Schimke R.T. Kaufman R.J. Alt F.W. Kellems R.F. Science. 1978; 202 (21): 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The AEP cDNA was cloned into the vector pcDNA DHFR (27Ding S. Yao D. Burchell B. Wolf C.R. Friedberg T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), DHFR- CHO cells were transfected, and initial selection was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Selected colonies were then subjected to stepwise selection with increasing concentrations of the DHFR inhibitor methotrexate until the desired level of AEP production had been achieved. Amplification of the DHFR gene was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of cells labeled with fluorescinated methotrexate (Ref. 31Kaufman R.J. Bertino J.R. Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5852-5860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown), and parallel AEP overproduction was demonstrated by Western blotting of both the cells and growth medium. As shown in Fig. 1 AEP was readily detected in 5 μl of conditioned growth medium and in cell lysates from various selected clones. Parallel electrophoresis of purified pig kidney AEP indicated that overproduction in the cells was considerable (Fig. 1a). The AEP protein found in the growth medium was the proenzyme (56 kDa). We found no evidence of secretion of the mature enzyme (36 kDa), which was confined to cell lysates and migrated somewhat more slowly than purified mature pig kidney enzyme run in parallel (Fig. 1). To estimate the overproduction of AEP more accurately, we measured the hydrolysis of the AEP substrate Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-NHMec by CHO cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1b, the initial rates of hydrolysis of this substrate indicated that at least 40-fold overproduction of active enzyme had been achieved in the cell lysates alone. We included a C-terminal histidine tag to aid purification of the proenzyme from CHO cell supernatants. Stepwise Autoactivation of AEP at Acidic pH—We next attempted to autoactivate the purified proenzyme. As shown in the Coomassie Blue-stained gels in Fig. 2a, exposure to pH values in the range 6.0-5.5 resulted in the partial disappearance of the 56-kDa precursor and the appearance of 47- and 11-kDa products. Interestingly, little enzyme activity appeared, even at pH 5.0 where a significant amount of the 56-kDa precursor became converted. Similarly, below pH 3.5 we observed conversion of the 56-kDa precursor, but again enzyme activity failed to appear. As shown in Fig. 2b, active enzyme only appeared in a pH “window” between 4.5-3.5 and paralleled a small but clear increase in mobility of the major product of autocatalysis from 47 to 46 kDa (Fig. 2a). We sequenced the N termini of all the products generated at pH 5.8 and 4.5. As shown in Fig. 2a, whereas the inactive 56- and 47-kDa forms of AEP had the N-terminal sequence VPIDDP, the active 46-kDa form of AEP began with the sequence GGKHWV. Thus the inactive 47-kDa form of AEP was extended by 8 residues at the N terminus compared with the active 46-kDa form (Fig. 2c). We also sequenced the smaller 11-kDa processing product generated over a wide range of pH values (Fig. 2a). This product began with the sequence DLEESR demonstrating autocatalytic cleavage after Asn323 as previously reported by Chen and colleagues (25Chen J.M. Fortunato M. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 327-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our hands it appeared to be the subsequent N-terminal cleavage after Asp25 that led to enzyme activation (Fig. 2 and see below). The Final Step in AEP Maturation Is Not Autocatalytic but Occurs Following Normal Cellular Processing—AEP found in living cells has a mass of ∼36 kDa, considerably smaller than the autocatalytically activated 46-kDa material. No processing beyond the 46-kDa product occurred in vitro even upon prolonged incubation. To test whether the purified recombinant 56-kDa proenzyme was capable of being fully processed by living cells, we labeled it with 125I and offered this as a substrate for endocytic capture and processing by living CHO cells. We anticipated that the secreted 56-kDa precursor would still carry the necessary targeting signals, most likely mannose-6-phosphate, and that they might be recognized by receptors cycling between the cell surface and endosomes (32Rome L.H. Weissmann B. Neufeld E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2331-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3a (left panel) the radioiodinated 56-kDa precursor autoactivated normally to the 46-kDa form in vitro. After 1, 3, and 6 h of incubation with 125I-56kDa AEP, CHO cells were harvested, and accumulation of radiolabeled AEP was assessed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3a (right panel), the labeled proenzyme was taken up and converted to the 36-kDa mature form. There was little accumulation of either the 56-kDa or intermediate 47/46-kDa forms of AEP, indicating rapid cellular processing. Thus the recombinant pro-enzyme is capable of being rapidly and fully processed to the final 36-kDa form when added exogenously to living cells. We conclude that final maturation of AEP is most likely not autocatalytic but mediated by other lysosomal proteases. However, the identity of these enzymes remains uncertain. Neither leupeptin, E64 (Fig. 3a), or pepstatin (not shown) had much impact on the maturation of 56-kDa AEP, although in some experiments evidence of accumulation of a form slightly larger than 36 kDa was obtained with high concentrations of leupeptin (Fig. 3a). These inhibitors were active because the 11-kDa C-terminal propeptide accumulated to a greater extent in leupeptin and E64-treated cells (Fig. 3a). In addition, there was a noticeable increase in the amount of 56-kDa precursor associated with the cells. We suggest that a small proportion of the iodinated 56-kDa precursor fails to autoactivate and that this material is normally destroyed by leupeptin- and E64-sensitive lysosomal proteases that also degrade the 11-kDa C-terminal propeptide. We were surprised to find no evidence for intermediate 46/47-kDa forms of AEP in the experiments described above. Most likely in the minimum time needed (1 h) to see accumulation of endocytosed AEP, conversion has already occurred. To establish that the 47- and 46-kDa forms are bona fide intermediates in AEP autoactivation in living cells, we also examined the maturation of biosynthetically labeled AEP. To distinguish between inactive (56 and 47 kDa) and active (46 and 36 kDa) forms of AEP, we raised an antiserum in rabbits against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N terminus of the 56/47-kDa forms and a sheep antiserum that recognizes all forms of AEP. As expected, the rabbit serum did not recognize the active 46-kDa (or 36-kDa) species, whereas the sheep serum did (Fig. 3b). The AEP-overexpressing CHO cell line 3A5 was pulsed with [35S]Met/Cys for 5 min and chased for various times, and the status of AEP was examined by sequential immunoprecipitation with the rabbit followed by the sheep antiserum. After the short pulse, most of the AEP migrated at the 56-kDa precursor size and over a 4-h period chased to the fully mature 36-kDa form, which was precipitated by the sheep but not the rabbit serum (Fig. 3c). However, the rabbit serum, raised against the N-terminal peptide, was able to precipitate a processed form of AEP that appeared transiently after 15 min of chase and that migrated around 47 kDa (Fig. 3c). Thus the C-terminally processed but N-terminally intact 47-kDa interm"

These factors catalyze all major steps of mRNA translation in a GTP-dependent manner. Here, it is shown how the position of peptidyl-tRNA in the ribosome and presence of its peptide control the binding and GTPase activity of these translation factors. The results explain how idling GTPase activity and negative interference between different translation factors are avoided and suggest that hybrid sites for tRNA on the ribosome play essential roles in translocation of tRNAs, recycling of class 1 release factors by RF3, and recycling of ribosomes back to a new round of initiation. We also propose a model for translocation of tRNAs in two separate steps, which clarifies the roles of EF-G·GTP and GTP hydrolysis in this process."

In contrast, α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI) Pittsburgh (P1 Met → Arg natural variant) inhibits thrombin 17 times faster than pentasaccharide heparin-activated antithrombin. We present here x-ray structures of free and S195A trypsin-bound α1PI Pittsburgh, which show that the reactive center loop (RCL) possesses a canonical conformation in the free serpin that does not change upon binding to S195A trypsin and that contacts the proteinase only between P2 and P2′.

Reaction rates of trypsin and thrombin with α1PI Pittsburgh and antithrombin and their P2 variants show that the low antithrombin-thrombin reaction rate results from the antithrombin RCL sequence at P2 and implies that, in solution, the antithrombin RCL must be in a similar canonical conformation to that found here for α1PI Pittsburgh, even in the nonheparin-activated state. This suggests a general, limited, canonical-like interaction between serpins and proteinases in their Michaelis complexes.

This suggests a general, limited, canonical-like interaction between serpins and proteinases in their Michaelis complexes. Although antithrombin is the principal inhibitor of the blood coagulation proteinases thrombin and factor Xa, its rate of reaction with each of these proteinases is slow in the absence of heparin (1Olson S.T.

Pittsburgh, was found to be a very effective inhibitor of thrombin, with a second order rate constant for thrombin inhibition 17-fold higher than that of antithrombin that had been conformationally activated by pentasaccharide heparin (3Travis J. Matheson N.R. George P.M. Carrell R.W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 4Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In the individual who carried the Pittsburgh mutation, the potent thrombin inhibitory capability of this variant serpin resulted in hemorrhage and ultimately death. In antithrombin, heparin is a multifactorial enhancer that can not only act as a bridging cofactor to bring serpin and proteinase together but can also induce a conformational change in antithrombin that results in expulsion of the two distal residues of the RCL from β-sheet A (5Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 6Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that this loop expulsion permits alteration of the RCL conformation in the vicinity of the scissile bond to a more optimal one for interaction with proteinase and so contributes significantly to the heparin-induced acceleration of proteinase inhibition. In keeping with this proposal, the RCL conformation of antithrombin in published x-ray structures has the P1 arginine residue turned inwards toward the body of the protein, where it forms a salt bridge to Glu255 (7Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). However, these x-ray structures are all of antithrombin dimers that contain one molecule of functionally active antithrombin and one in an inactive, latent conformation. Importantly, the RCL of the functional molecule forms the interface with the latent molecule, as an extra strand of β-sheet C of that molecule. This raises the question of whether the conformation of the active molecule has been artificially altered by heterodimer formation and thus of whether it represents the conformation of antithrombin in solution. In an attempt to understand the structural basis for α1PI Pittsburgh being able to inhibit thrombin at a high rate, and thus also to provide insight into the low basal reactivity of antithrombin, we have determined crystal structures of free and S195A trypsin-bound forms of the Pittsburgh variant of the serpin α1-proteinase inhibitor and correlated these with rate constants for inhibition of thrombin and trypsin by α1PI Pittsburgh, by antithrombin, and by P2 variants of each of these serpins. Protein Expression and Purification—α1PI Pittsburgh, containing seven stabilizing mutations that hinder polymerization (9Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and a C232S mutation that prevents intermolecular disulfide bond formation, was expressed and refolded as previously described (10Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11884-11892Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The P2 Pro → Gly variant was made by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed and purified as for α1PI Pittsburgh. S195A bovine trypsinogen was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and refolded, purified, and activated as previously described (11Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6275-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The noncovalent complex between S195A trypsin and α1PI Pittsburgh was formed at pH 7.5 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, and the complex was purified on Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences), dialyzed, and concentrated to 15 mg ml–1 in 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.0, containing 25 mm NaCl. Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—α1PI Pittsburgh crystals were obtained at 20 °C using the hanging drop method, by mixing equal volumes of protein (25 mg/ml) and well solutions (0.2 m potassium citrate, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 6.30). An irregular rod-shaped crystal (0.9 × 0.25 × 0.1 mm) grew within 1 month. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature from a single crystal on a Rigaku RAXIS II detector, with a Rigaku RU-H2R rotating anode x-ray generator. Data were indexed with DENZO and scaled and reduced with SCALEPACK. Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using the structure of wild type α1PI (1QLP). Molecular replacement calculations were performed with CNS. Electron density maps were interpreted using Quanta. The model was progressively refined using simulated annealing at constant temperature, followed by energy minimization and manual inspection and rebuilding. 22 N-terminal amino acids and the histidine tag were not visible in the final electron density maps.

Diffraction data were collected from two single, flash frozen, crystals, cryoprotected in oil, using synchrotron radiation at the SERCAT beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory). Data were indexed and processed as described above. The structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement using CNS programs with the structures of human α1PI (1QLP) and bovine trypsin (1EJM) as search models. The final refined model of the complex was obtained as described for α1PI Pittsburgh. Statistics are given in Table I. Kinetic Measurements—Inhibition of trypsin by α1PI Pittsburgh was followed at 25 °C by progress curve analysis using a continuous assay. 1 nm trypsin was mixed with 10–50 nm α1PI Pittsburgh in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, containing 250 μm S-2222 chromogenic substrate. Product release was followed by change in absorbance at 405 nm. Curves obtained at different α1PI concentrations were fitted by a single exponential function with Sigma-Plot software, and values for k obs were plotted against [I]0/(1 + [S]0/Km), where [I]0 and [S]0 are the initial concentrations of α1PI and S-2222, respectively. The second-order rate constant was obtained from the slope. The trypsin-P2 Pro → Gly α1PI Pittsburgh complex had very low stability. The rate of complex formation was therefore determined from SDS-PAGE analysis of the reaction products obtained under conditions where dissociation of the covalent complex was negligible (12Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The α1PI Pittsburgh P2 Gly variant (0.2 μg) was mixed with trypsin (0.05 μg) at room temperature (22 °C) in 10 μl of assay buffer. Samples were removed at intervals from 3 to 80 s, the reaction was quenched by mixing immediately with 10 μl of preheated reduced SDS-loading buffer and heating for 2 min, and reaction products were immediately analyzed by 10–20% gradient Tris/glycine SDS-PAGE. Band intensities were determined by densitometry and converted to relative concentrations. The second-order rate constant was determined from the slope of a plot of time against log([ΔI]/[ΔE]), where I represents serpin and E is proteinase. The rate of thrombin inhibition by the P2G variant was determined by discontinuous assay. 25 nm thrombin was mixed with 250 nm P2G α1PI Pittsburgh, and the residual proteinase activity was determined at intervals by diluting the reaction mixture into assay buffer containing 75 μm S-2238 chromogenic substrate. Residual proteinase activity was plotted against time and analyzed by nonlinear least-squares fitting in Sigma-Plot software using the following equation: [E] t = [E]0 e – k obs t. The second order rate constant, k, was determined by dividing k obs by the initial α1PI concentration. Stoichiometries of Inhibition—The stoichiometry of inhibition of α1PI Pittsburgh P2G variant for thrombin was determined by plotting residual proteinase activity against the serpin/proteinase ratio, after incubating the serpin (20–400 nm) with 200 nm thrombin in assay buffer at 25 °C and allowing the reactions to go to completion. Residual thrombin activity was determined by diluting the reaction mixture 100-fold with assay buffer containing 100 μm S-2238 and measuring the rate of substrate hydrolysis at 405 nm. The stoichiometry of inhibition of α1PI Pittsburgh for trypsin was determined analogously, except that residual activity of trypsin was measured by diluting the reaction mixture 500-fold into assay buffer containing 250 μm S-2222. Structure of the α 1-PI Pittsburgh-S195A Trypsin Noncovalent Complex—Although the serpin-proteinase reaction cannot readily be halted at the stage of the initial noncovalent Michaelis complex, this complex is thought to be closely approximated by the noncovalent complex formed between the dehydroalanine or S195A form of the proteinase and the serpin. We have determined the structure of such a complex formed between S195A trypsin and the serpin α1PI Pittsburgh (Fig. 1a). The α1PI Pittsburgh RCL in the complex had a canonical conformation (Fig. 1b) similar to that found previously for noncomplexed wild-type serpin (13Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As expected, the active site of the proteinase interacted with the serpin RCL, centered on the P1–P1′ scissile bond. No contacts were present between the serpin body and the proteinase, unlike the noncovalent complex of another serpin, heparin cofactor II, with S195A thrombin. Surprisingly, considering the high stability of the α1PI Pittsburgh-S195A trypsin complex (Kd ∼5 nm) (15Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), contacts between the serpin RCL and the proteinase are quite limited (Fig. 1c). Only the P1 arginine side chain has extensive interaction with the proteinase, being buried in the S1 specificity pocket. The remaining contacts involve hydrogen bonds between the backbone of serpin residues P2 to P2′ with backbone atoms of the proteinase, in a manner almost identical to that of classical canonical serine proteinase inhibitors (16Bode W. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). This differs from an earlier structure of S195A rat trypsin with Manduca sexta serpin 1B A353K variant, which showed some additional contacts between more distal parts of the RCL and surface loops of trypsin that were suggested to be important for binding (17Ye S. Cech A.L. Belmares R. Bergstrom R.C. Tong Y. Corey D.R. Kanost M. Goldsmith E.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We do not, however, find such a difference for our complex, in which the interaction of the serpin with S195A trypsin is equivalent to that of BPTI, and consequently the serpin has an RCL conformation superimposable on that of the interaction loop of BPTI. Structure of Free α 1-PI Pittsburgh—We also determined the x-ray crystal structure of native α1PI Pittsburgh and found minimal differences between the structure of the free serpin and the serpin in noncovalent complex with S195A trypsin. The serpin body in the two species overlaid with root mean square deviation of only 0.6 Å for 240 non-RCL C-α atoms. This lack of conformational change for both the serpin body and the trypsin moiety upon forming complex is what had been found previously from NMR measurements for the same complex (10Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11884-11892Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Peterson F.C. Gordon N.C. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6275-6293Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Even within the RCL, the only significant differences were in the region where the loop joins the serpin body, distally from the scissile bond. Within P5 to P5′ (Glu-Ala-Ile-Pro-Arg-Ser-Ile-Pro-Pro-Glu), however, which encompasses the whole of the region that interacts with S195A trypsin, there were almost identical backbone conformations in free and complexed states (Fig. 2). This RCL conformation was also very similar to that of wild-type α1PI, which has previously been pointed out to have a canonical conformation (13Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Comparison of RCL Conformations—Whether this same conformation of the RCL of α1PI Pittsburgh could also fit into the active site of thrombin without need for structural change was evaluated from a comparison of the present structure with the recent x-ray structure of the equivalent noncovalent complex of S195A thrombin with the thrombin-specific serpin heparin cofactor II (18Baglin T.P. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11079-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The corresponding P5–P5′ sequences of heparin cofactor II and (for later comparison) of antithrombin are Gly-Phe-Met-Pro-Leu-Ser-Thr-Gln-Val-Arg and Val-Ile-Ala-Gly-Arg-Ser-Leu-Asn-Pro-Asn, respectively. Although the P1 residue of heparin cofactor II is a leucine residue rather than arginine, it is nevertheless a good serpin for comparison with α1PI Pittsburgh, since, in addition to both serpins being thrombin inhibitors, both have P2 proline residues and P1′ serine residues, and the P1 leucine of heparin cofactor II occupies the S1 pocket of S195A thrombin in the same way that arginine in α1PI Pittsburgh does in our noncovalent complex with S195A trypsin. Superpositioning of the RCLs of α1PI Pittsburgh and heparin cofactor II, both from their noncovalent complexes with S195A proteinase, shows that the backbone conformations are almost identical in the region flanking the scissile bond (Fig. 3). Even the P1 side chain, which is very different in the two serpins, projects in the same direction, so as to fit in the S1 pocket in both cases. Modeling of α 1PI Pittsburgh RCL into Thrombin Active Site—Although trypsin and thrombin have the same fold, they differ significantly at the entrance to the active site. Whereas trypsin has relatively unhindered access, thrombin has two insertion loops, one on either side of the active site, that limit access and are thought to contribute to the much greater protein substrate selectivity of thrombin. Prior to the x-ray structure determination of the noncovalent complex of E192Q thrombin with BPTI, it was thought that thrombin underwent no conformational change in binding to inhibitors. Indeed, all of the structures of thrombin with low molecular weight inhibitors had shown the same conformation for the insertion loops as well as for the core catalytic domain. The structure of the E192Q thrombin-BPTI complex, however, showed a major displacement of the “60 loop” and “150 loop,” which permitted access of BPTI to the active site (19Van de Locht A. Bode W. Huber R. Le Bonniec B.F. Stone S.R. Esmon C.T. Stubbs M.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2977-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This distortion accounts for the lower binding energy of the BPTI-thrombin complex compared with the BPTI-trypsin complex. In the heparin cofactor II-S195A thrombin noncovalent complex, these insertion loops are also displaced relative to uncomplexed thrombin, although to a slightly different degree than in the BPTI complex (Fig. 4a). It is therefore expected that a similar displacement of these insertion loops would allow α1PI Pittsburgh to interact with thrombin in a tightly binding canonical-like manner (Fig. 4b), without need for changing the α1PI Pittsburgh RCL conformation. Modeling of Known Antithrombin RCL into Thrombin—The RCL conformation of antithrombin found in all x-ray structures is dramatically different from that of α1PI Pittsburgh and from heparin cofactor II (Fig. 5a), implying that there would be very poor complementarity between thrombin and an antithrombin RCL that had such a conformation in solution (Fig. 5b). With such a solution conformation, the RCL of antithrombin would require a major conformational change to become like that of α1PI Pittsburgh and hence to be able to bind satisfactorily with thrombin. Rates of Reaction of α 1PI Pittsburgh and Antithrombin with Trypsin and Thrombin—A recent extensive study of the rates of cleavage of peptide substrates by trypsin, thrombin, and factor Xa has shown that the rates of cleavage of unconstrained peptides by trypsin show very little dependence on residues flanking P1, whereas for cleavage of thrombin, there is very much higher specificity, particularly at the P2 position (20Bianchini E.P.

Thus, change of the P2 residue from Pro to Gly results in almost no change in rate for cleavage by trypsin but a 20-fold reduction in rate for cleavage by thrombin. To determine whether the same pattern of specificity is shown in the more constrained RCL of α1PI Pittsburgh, we created a P2 Pro → Gly variant of α1PI Pittsburgh and compared the rates of reaction of the P2 Pro and P2 Gly forms of the serpin with both trypsin and thrombin. For reaction with trypsin, both α1PI variants gave similar rates of reaction, as was seen with peptide substrates (Table II). In addition, the absolute values of the rate constants were less than 1 order of magnitude lower than for the peptides. For reaction with thrombin, a similar relationship was observed between rates of peptide substrate cleavage and serpin reaction for these two α1PI variants. Thus, α1PI Pittsburgh (P2 Pro) reacted about 30-fold faster than the P2 Gly variant, which was similar to the equivalent peptide substrates (Table II). In addition, the absolute values of the rate constants showed only a slightly larger decrease between free peptide and serpin RCL reactions than did the reactions with trypsin.Table IISecond order rate constants for inhibition of thrombin and trypsin by α 1PI Pittsburgh and antithrombinProteinaseP2α1PI PittsburghaAll rate constants have been corrected for stoichiometry of inhibition (24).AntithrombinbData from Ref. 25.AT + 5merbData from Ref. 25.PeptidecData from Ref. 20.ThrombinGly1.0 × 1041.1 × 1041.8 × 1041.5 × 105ThrombinPro3.1 × 1054.0 × 1042.7 × 1053.8 × 106TrypsinGly8 × 1052 × 1056.4 × 1057.6 × 106TrypsinPro1.8 × 1061.8 × 1051.9 × 1057.5 × 106a All rate constants have been corrected for stoichiometry of inhibition (24Hood D.B.

Open table in a new tab Compared with the α1PI Pittsburgh analog, pentasaccharide-activated wild-type antithrombin (P2 Gly) reacts about as fast or faster with either trypsin or thrombin (Table II). The antithrombin RCL conformation in this heparin-bound form is therefore likely to require no more change in conformation to be able to bind to either of these proteinases than does α1PI Pittsburgh. Similarly, for the P2 Pro variant of antithrombin bound to heparin pentasaccharide, the rate of reaction with thrombin is almost the same as for the reaction of α1PI Pittsburgh, again implying equivalent minimal change in conformation upon binding. Whereas it is true that the rate of reaction of antithrombin with thrombin is lower in the absence of heparin pentasaccharide than in its presence, the reduction is only 1.6-fold for the wild-type and a little more (6-fold) for the P2 Pro variant (Table II). Inhibition of serine proteinases by serpins involves initial noncovalent binding of the proteinase to the RCL of the serpin, followed by attack of the active site serine on the P1–P1′ peptide bond of the serpin. The rate-limiting step for inhibition is typically formation of the initial Michaelis-like complex that involves docking of the proteinase active site with the serpin RCL (21Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Based on the x-ray structures of α1PI Pittsburgh, alone and in noncovalent complex with S195A trypsin presented here, and on previous structures of wild-type α1PI, we can conclude that the RCLs of these serpins are already in a preferred, canonical conformation to interact with trypsin or elastase, respectively, and form the initial, rate-determining Michaelis-like complex. This may account both for the high affinity of the noncovalent complexes and the very high rates of reaction with active trypsin and elastase, for the Pittsburgh and wild-type proteins, respectively. Although we did not determine the structure of the noncovalent complex of α1PI Pittsburgh with S195A thrombin, the availability of such a structure for another serpin, heparin cofactor II, allowed us to compare the RCL conformations of heparin cofactor II in complex with S195A thrombin with that of α1PI Pittsburgh in complex with S195A trypsin. Based on a near identity of conformation of the two RCLs, it is expected that α1PI Pittsburgh could also form an optimal, canonical noncovalent complex with thrombin without need for change in conformation of the RCL compared with that in the free state. In contrast, the conformation of the antithrombin RCL from published x-ray structures is noncanonical and consequently would not fit into the active site of thrombin without major distortion. This would presumably require significant energy and consequently result in a major rate reduction for formation of this complex compared with its formation by α1PI Pittsburgh. That this is not the case, either for P2 Gly or P2 Pro forms of antithrombin compared with the equivalent α1PI Pittsburgh species, strongly suggests that the solution conformation of the antithrombin RCL around the scissile bond is not like that in the crystal structure but is already like that of α1PI Pittsburgh and hence requires little further conformational change to bind to thrombin. Our kinetic results also suggest that, for α1PI Pittsburgh, the 30-fold reduction in rate upon replacement of proline at P2 by glycine is not a result of conformational differences, since the free peptides show a similar rate reduction. Since the rate of reaction of α1PI Pittsburgh with thrombin is only 6-fold lower than with trypsin, it is likely that the RCL conformations are the same as those found for the complexes of HCII with S195A thrombin and α1PI Pittsburgh with S195A trypsin and that the modest rate reduction results from the need to bring about the same kind of displacement of the 60 and 150 loops of thrombin as was seen in the HCII-S195A thrombin noncovalent complex. Taken together, these rate correlations imply that the RCL of α1PI Pittsburgh, with either P2 Pro or P2 Gly, has the same canonical conformation in complexes with S195A trypsin and S195A thrombin and that differences in rates of reaction result from changes in P2 side chain contacts in thrombin and from the need to displace the 60 and 150 loops of thrombin to accommodate the serpin RCL. A similar conclusion can be drawn with regard to pentasaccharide-activated antithrombin, thus providing an answer to the question of why α1PI Pittsburgh is a faster inhibitor of thrombin than pentasaccharide-activated antithrombin. Since the 15-fold increase in the rate of inhibition of thrombin by pentasaccharide-activated antithrombin upon changing the normal P2 Gly to Pro parallels the behavior in α1PI Pittsburgh and free peptides, it most likely reflects the changes in contacts between the proline and glycine side chains and thrombin, rather than differences in conformation of the RCLs of the two serpins. α1PI Pittsburgh is therefore a faster inhibitor of thrombin than pentasaccharide-activated antithrombin primarily because it has a proline at P2 rather than the glycine that is present in antithrombin. For antithrombin in the absence of activating heparin, the small reductions in the rate of reaction with thrombin are unlikely to result from major conformational differences between pentasaccharide-activated and native antithrombin in the vicinity of the scissile bond but may result from the greater restraint placed on the RCL in the native state by the anchoring of two RCL residues, P14 and P15, in the β-sheet A. Indeed, a fluorescence lifetime study of a N-((2-acetoxy)ethyl-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole fluorophore covalently bound to cysteine introduced at P1 as a replacement for arginine showed that the fluorophore experiences a similarly solvent-exposed environment in heparin-free and heparin-bound forms of antithrombin (22Futamura A. Beechem J.M. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6680-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The fluorescence enhancement that the N-((2-acetoxy)ethyl-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole fluorophore undergoes upon heparin binding results from a dequenching of about 50% of the N-((2-acetoxy)-ethyl-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, probably as a result of movement of the RCL outward from the serpin body, but without need for a change in backbone conformation at and near to the P1-P1′ bond. Significance of Canonical Binding of Serpins—Our finding that α1PI Pittsburgh interacts with S195A trypsin analogously to true canonical inhibitors, as had been predicted by Elliott and colleagues (13Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 14Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the further demonstration that this mode of interaction is also used in two other noncovalent serpin-proteinase complexes, those of heparin cofactor II with S195A thrombin and M. sexta serpin 1B with S195A rat trypsin, raises the question of what makes serpins different from canonical inhibitors. The present findings show that the difference is not due to a fundamental difference in the conformation of the RCLs presented to proteinase. In addition, since proteolytic cleavage of the RCL of canonical inhibitors can take place, cleavage versus noncleavage is not per se a fundamental difference between these types of inhibitor. Instead, the difference appears to be in the position of the equilibrium between the cleaved and intact forms of the inhibitor. With classical canonical inhibitors, the equilibrium constant between intact and RCL-cleaved forms is close to 1 at physiological pH, demonstrating that there is little if any energy difference between these two states as a result of the constraints placed on the RCL. In serpins, however, cleavage of the RCL at the acyl enzyme intermediate stage removes the physical constraint that maintains the RCL as a fully exposed loop at the “top” of the molecule. Since the serpin conformation in which the cleaved RCL has inserted into β-sheet A is very much more stable than that in which it remains exposed, there is an enormous thermodynamic push toward the loop-inserted state, once the acyl intermediate has been formed. That some of this energy is used to “crush” the proteinase and hence trap it kinetically is a consequence of the evolution of the complete serpin mechanism. However, it should not detract from the realization that serpins, in their initial interaction with the proteinase, even up to acyl enzyme formation, are behaving as canonical inhibitors. This conclusion has relevance to the question of how the serpin inhibitory mechanism may have evolved, since the mechanism imposes severe requirements on the serpin for the mechanism to work efficiently. First, the serpin must fold into a metastable state, such that the loop insertion that follows reactive center loop cleavage is highly favorable energetically. Such metastable folding of proteins is extremely rare. Second, the rate at which loop insertion occurs must be fast enough that translocation of the proteinase and subsequent “crushing” of the proteinase must occur fast enough to compete with the alternative of simple hydrolysis of the peptide bond. Inappropriate residues within the hinge of the RCL that might slow down insertion or too slow an opening of β-sheet A to accommodate the inserting RCL would be sufficient to inactivate the mechanism or greatly reduce its effectiveness. It is hard to imagine that all of the structural requirements needed by a serpin to make it work properly came about simultaneously. Instead, serpins more likely evolved by a progressive incorporation of features of this mechanism. It is possible that a primordial serpin, which may have originally had an alternative function, had an exposed loop that could interact with a proteinase but was not constrained enough to inhibit it efficiently. Mutations both within the hinge of the loop and within and under β-sheet A may have promoted partial insertion of the loop, which would have reduced the conformational freedom of the loop and perhaps made it into a better canonical inhibitor (indeed, there is precedent for such partial insertion in antithrombin). Subsequent changes within the serpin body may have allowed further insertion upon cleavage of the scissile bond and therefore the start of movement of the proteinase, perhaps resulting in a partial compromise of activity. Gradually, full insertion might have evolved to more effectively compromise the proteinase. If all serpins thus started out more like canonical inhibitors with little or no ability to loop-insert into β-sheet A, it may be that some serpins whose RCLs are still not able to insert may be like these primordial serpins and actually be inhibitors of the canonical type. This may be especially true if residues within the RCL restrict conformational freedom. A possible example is pigment epithelium-derived factor, which appears incapable of facile loop insertion upon RCL cleavage but has a well exposed RCL that contains rigidifying prolines at positions P10, P8, P4, and P3′ (23Simonovic M.

However, a mutant MOR, which is truncated after the amino acid residue Ser363 (MOR363D), was found to undergo phosphorylation-independent internalization and desensitization. As expected, MOR363D, missing the putative agonist-induced phosphorylation sites, did not exhibit detectable agonist-induced phosphorylation. MOR363D underwent slower internalization as reflected in the attenuation of membrane translocation of β-arrestin 2 when compared with wild type MOR, but the level of receptor being internalized was similar to that of wild type MOR after 4 h of etorphine treatment. Furthermore, MOR363D was observed to desensitize faster than that of wild type MOR upon agonist activation. Surface biotinylation assay demonstrated that the wild type receptors recycled back to membrane after agonist-induced internalization, which contributed to the receptor resensitization and thus partially reversed the receptor desensitization. On the contrary, MOR363D did not recycle after internalization. Hence, MOR desensitization is controlled by the receptor internalization and the recycling of internalized receptor to cell surface in an active state. Taken together, our data indicated that receptor phosphorylation is not absolutely required in the internalization, but receptor phosphorylation and subsequent β-arrestin recruitment play important roles in the resensitization of internalized receptors.

Following the agonist activation of the receptor, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are recruited to the membrane and phosphorylate the agonist-activated GPCRs. GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation enhances the interaction between GPCRs and cytoplasmic proteins, arrestins, which uncouple the GPCRs from G proteins and also target the GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits for internalization (endocytosis). The internalized receptors can subsequently be dephosphorylated and recycled back to the plasma membrane, which contributes to resensitization. Alternatively, the internalized receptors can be targeted to lysosome for degradation (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Receptor desensitization, the progressive loss of receptor function under continued exposure to an agonist, occurs in many GPCRs. Desensitization can be a consequence of multiple processes of receptor uncoupling, internalization, degradation, and recycling. Therefore, phosphorylation of agonist-activated receptors and subsequent arrestin recruitment are important processes in the modulation of GPCRs responsiveness. However, multiple studies challenge the critical role phosphorylation played in desensitization and internalization of many GPCRs.

Thus, these observations suggest a more complicated picture in the regulation of GPCRs. The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) belongs to the rhodopsin subfamily of GPCRs. Similar to other members of this family, MOR undergoes receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, internalization, and recycling upon agonist activation. The roles of phosphorylation and the subsequent events in MOR desensitization and internalization have been extensively studied. Overexpression of GRK2 increases agonist-induced phosphorylation and promotes the processes of internalization and desensitization (12Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A.

The enhanced phosphorylation of MOR has been correlated with the desensitization of MOR in thalamus of rats chronically treated with morphine (17Deng H.B. Yu Y. Wang H. Guang W. Wang J.B. Brain Res. 2001; 898: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All these results support the hypothesis that receptor phosphorylation leading to subsequent cellular events is necessary for the functional regulation of MOR. However, other reports have suggested the rate of MOR desensitization and internalization is controlled by cellular events other than receptor phosphorylation. There is a discrepancy between the rate of MOR phosphorylation and desensitization (18El-Kouhen R. Kouhen O.M. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A receptor mutant that has no obvious change in the level of agonist-induced phosphorylation does not undergo the agonist-induced down-regulation (19Burd A.L. El-Kouhen R. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H.

Mutation of Thr180 to alanine, which has not been shown to be an agonist-induced phosphorylation site, has resulted in the blunting of the agonist-induced MOR desensitization (20Celver J.P. Lowe J.

Hence, whether MOR phosphorylation is a prerequisite for agonist-induced receptor desensitization remains controversial. Thus, in the current study, we examined the role of receptor phosphorylation in MOR internalization and desensitization by truncating the MOR after Ser363 (MOR363D) to remove the putative phosphorylation sites (Thr370 and Ser375) in the carboxyl tail (16El-Kouhen R.

For N2A clone expressing MOR, the B max and Kd values for [3H]diprenorphine were determined to be 1.9 pmol/mg protein and 0.30 ± 0.04 nm, respectively. For N2A clone expressing MOR363D, the B max and Kd values for [3H]diprenorphine were 2.3 pmol/mg protein and 0.43 ± 0.16 nm, respectively. The potency of etorphine to inhibit forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP production is similar in both cell clones. All experiments were performed with these two cell clones if not specified. Stable transfected cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 μg/ml G418 in a 10% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Determination of Receptor Desensitization and Resensitization by Measurement of Intracellular cAMP Levels—Approximately 4 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates the day before experiment. For desensitization assays, cells were exposed to 1 μm etorphine, morphine, or DAMGO for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 6 h. For resensitization experiments, the cells were washed after 4 h of etorphine exposure and incubated at 37 °C for different periods (0, 10, 20, 30, or 60 min) in the absence of etorphine. Then the medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl treatment buffer with or without agonist. The treatment buffer consisted of 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and 10 μm forskolin in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (KRHB; 110 mm NaCl, 25 mm glucose, 55 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by heating cells at 90 °C for 4 min. Then cells were cooled on ice for 10 min and stored at 4 °C until cAMP assay. The measurement of cAMP level in supernatant was performed by using AlphaScreen™ cAMP detection kit (BioSignal, Montreal, Canada). Determination of Receptor Internalization by FACS Analysis—N2A cells stably expressing MOR or MOR363D were incubated with 1 μm etorphine for the indicated time intervals. Cells were then chilled on ice to stop membrane trafficking, and all subsequent incubations were performed at 4 °C. Residual cell surface receptors were monitored by incubating cells with anti-HA antibody (1:500) in serum-free DMEM for 1 h followed by an incubation with the Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500) for 1 h.

Fluorescence intensity of 10,000 cells was collected for each sample. All experiments were conducted at least three times with triplicate samples. Receptor Phosphorylation—Cells cultured in 150-mm dishes were incubated with 1 μm etorphine for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated on ice at which point the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently lysed in 3 ml lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml Complete® protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science), and with 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium vanadate as phosphatase inhibitors). After solubilization, insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Then the samples were incubated in the presence of 10 μg of rabbit anti-phosphorylated proteins antibody and prewashed immunopure protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The final samples were eluted from the agarose beads with 2× SDS sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-Cl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The immunoprecipitated receptors were detected by incubation with mouse anti-HA (HA.11, 1:2000) and goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphase (1:5000). Blots were developed using enhanced chemifluorescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned with Storm 840. Confocal Imaging—N2A cells stably expressing wild type or mutant MOR were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged β-arrestin 2 using the transfection reagent effectene (Qiagen). Briefly, cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected with 0.8 μg GFP-tagged β-arrestin 2. 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and plated onto poly-l-lysine coated coverslips. Treatments were carried out 48 h post-transfection and the cells fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. The cellular location of GFP-tagged β-arrestin 2 was visualized with a Bio-Rad confocal microscopy (MRC 1024). Surface Biotinylation Assay—Stably transfected N2A cells expressing wild type MOR or MOR363D receptors were biotinylated at 4 °C with 900 μg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Biotinylation reaction was quenched by rinsing with Tris-buffered saline (154 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Then cells were warmed to 37 °C and incubated with 50 μm monensin for 1 h or not, followed by incubation with 1 μm etorphine for 30 min or 2 h. The remaining cell surface biotin was cleaved with a stripping buffer (50 mm glutathione, 0.3 m NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, and 1% fetal bovine serum) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 40 μg/ml Complete®, protease inhibitors mixture. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and was precipitated with streptavidin immobilized on agarose at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing the bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer. The eluted material was resolved on SDS gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The biotinylated receptors pulled down by streptavidin were detected by incubating the membrane with mouse anti-HA (HA.11, 1:2000) and goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphase (1:5000). Blots were developed using the enhanced chemifuorescence substrate and scanned with Storm 840. Band intensities were quantitated and analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). For recycling experiments, the biotinylated cells were treated with 1 μm etorphine for 30 min in the presence of 50 μm monensin. Then the cells were washed repeatedly to remove the monensin and etorphine, followed by incubating at 37 °C for different periods (0, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 h) before stripping the biotin or cell lysis. As controls, cells were biotinylated, quenched, and then lysed (100%) or the cells were biotinylated, quenched, stripped, and then lysed (strip). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Either unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed) or a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for statistical comparisons. When ANOVA was used and when this analysis indicated significance (p < 0.05), Dunnett's multiple comparison test was used to determine which conditions were significantly different from controls. Phosphorylation of MOR and MOR363D and the Translocation of β-Arrestin—Several studies report that the C terminus of MOR is involved in receptor phosphorylation (14Deng H.B. Yu Y. Pak Y. O'Dowd B.F.

Our studies (16El-Kouhen R. Burd A.L. Erickson-Herbrandson L.J. Chang C.Y. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12774-12780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) using mutagenesis analysis have indicated three Ser/Thr residues (Ser363, Thr370, and Ser375) in the C terminus of MOR as putative phosphorylation sites in HEK 293 cells. Basal phosphorylation is observed at Ser363 and Thr370, whereas the agonist-induced phosphorylation is observed at Thr370 and Ser375. This discrepancy of identified phosphorylation sites in different cell lines may indicate that the agonist-induced phosphorylation sites are cell-type specific. Hence the phosphorylation status of MOR363D expressed in N2A cells was examined. After 30 min of 1 μm etorphine pretreatment, phosphorylated receptors were immunoprecipitated by anti-phosphorylated protein antibodies and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1A, both basal phosphorylation and etorphine-stimulated phosphorylation were observed in wild type MOR, whereas MOR363D did not exhibit any basal phosphorylation and etorphine-stimulated phosphorylation. This observation indicated that the phosphorylation sites of MOR in N2A are located in the distal portion of C terminus after Ser363. Because GPCR phosphorylation is reported to facilitate β-arrestins binding to the receptors, the unphosphorylated MOR363D receptors should attenuate membrane recruitment of β-arrestins. N2A cells stably expressing MOR and MOR363D were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged β-arrestin 2 because MOR is shown to belong to class A GPCR that binds β-arrestin 2 with higher affinity than β-arrestin 1 and does not interact with visual arrestin (22Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The GFP-arrestin recruited to the membrane was detected visually by confocal microscopy. Consistent with previous studies (23Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), activation of wild type MOR induced by 1 μm etorphine strongly promoted recruitment of β-arrestin 2 to plasma membrane as reflected by the punctuate formation at the membrane (Fig. 1B). This process occurred rapidly after receptor activation (<2 min) with less β-arrestin 2 being translocated after 15 min of agonist treatment. On the contrary, agonist activation of MOR363D did not significantly enhance the translocation of β-arrestin 2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B). This result is consistent with the deficiency of agonist-induced phosphorylation of the MOR363D. Internalization of MOR and MOR363D—To investigate the capacity of MOR363D to undergo agonist-induced internalization, the time course of receptor internalization was evaluated by FACS analysis. MOR363D still internalized in the presence of 1 μm etorphine, although the process of internalization was slower than that observed with MOR. MOR363D internalized with half-life (t 1/2) = 2.2 ± 0.34 h, whereas MOR internalized with t 1/2 = 0.22 ± 0.13 h (Fig. 2). However, the levels of receptor being internalized for MOR and MOR363D were similar after 4 h treatment with etorphine, reaching the maximum of 62 ± 11% and 65 ± 5.0% after 6 h of etorphine treatment, respectively (Fig. 2). To exclude the clonal variation, a different N2A clone (clone number 15), which expressed 0.58 pmol/mg protein of MOR363D receptor, was employed and similar internalization kinetics was obtained with t 1/2 = 2.6 ± 0.30 h and maximal internalization rate was 74 ± 10.2% after 6 h of etorphine treatment (data not shown). Thus, it is evident that phosphorylation of the receptor and subsequent β-arrestin recruitment are not obligatory for agonist-induced internalization of MOR363D. But the rapid internalization rate observed with MOR is consistent with the phosphorylation and significant β-arrestin recruitment, suggesting that phosphorylation is involved in and facilitated the internalization of MOR. Desensitization of MOR and MOR363D—We next examined whether the observed differences in receptor internalization would affect the rate of agonist-induced desensitization. N2A cells expressing MOR or MOR363D were pre-incubated with 1 μm etorphine for various time periods followed by the measurement of agonist-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Wild type MOR exhibited substantial desensitization with 32 ± 6.3% loss in etorphine inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production after 6 h of agonist exposure. Unexpectedly, a more pronounced desensitization was observed with MOR363D, with 57 ± 8.8% loss in etorphine activity after 6 h agonist exposure (Fig. 3). Similar pronounced desensitization rate was obtained in another MOR363D-expressing N2A clone (clone number 15), which showed 60 ± 9.3% loss in etorphine activity after 6 h of agonist exposure (data not shown). Opioid agonists with different efficacy exhibit different capacities to induce desensitization (24Yu Y. Zhang L. Yin X. Sun H. Uhl G.R. Wang J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28869-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Kovoor A. Celver J.P. Wu A. Chavkin C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 704-711PubMed Google Scholar), and alkaloid and peptide agonists induce differential desensitization kinetics on δ-opioid receptors (26Allouche S. Roussel M. Marie N. Jauzac P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 371: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus the ability of morphine, an agonist with lower efficacy than etorphine and DAMGO, a peptide μ-opioid agonist, to induce receptor desensitization were also tested. Similarly, MOR363D-expressing cells exhibited faster desensitization rates following morphine or DAMGO pretreatment (data not shown). These results suggest that phosphorylation is not required for agonist-induced desensitization of MOR363D. Phosphorylation-deficient MOR363D exhibited a lower agonist-induced internalization rate but a markedly faster receptor desensitization rate. Internalization can enhance desensitization by reducing functional receptors at the cellular membrane or can reduce desensitization by promoting receptor recycling to cell surface. μ-Opioid receptor is reported to recycle back to membrane and resensitize after internalization (27Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 28Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schroder H. Kahl E. Hollt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, the slower desensitization rate of wild type MOR could be attributed to its faster recycling, which is associated with resensitization. The truncated carboxyl tail sequence missing in MOR363D could prevent recycling and resensitization. To test this hypothesis, we carried out desensitization assays in the presence of 50 μm monensin, which prevents receptor recycling by trapping the internalized receptors in endosomes. As shown in Fig. 3, upon monensin pretreatment, wild type MOR desensitized in a faster rate, which was significantly different from that observed in the absence of monensin. This rate was comparably similar to the desensitization rate of MOR363D observed in the absence of monensin. The addition of monensin did not significantly alter the agonist-induced desensitization rate of MOR363D. Again, the effects of monensin on morphine- or DAMGO-induced receptor desensitization were also studied, and similar increases in the desensitization kinetics were observed (data not shown). The Fate of Internalized Receptors—To further characterize the fate of internalized receptor, surface biotinylation assays were carried out. Cells expressing wild type MOR or MOR363D were biotinylated with a cleavable biotin label as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After agonist treatment, biotinylated receptors still present in the cell surface were stripped. Thus, the detected biotinylated receptors were only those internalized receptors neither recycled nor degraded. The internalized receptors in MOR363D-expressing cells after 30 min treatment of 1 μm etorphine was ∼20% of total receptors (Fig. 4, A and C), consistent with the results obtained with FACS analysis (Fig. 2), where ∼80% receptors were observed at cell surface. After 2 h of etorphine treatment, ∼35% MOR363D were observed in the internal compartments of the N2A cells (Fig. 4, A and C). This level was also quite similar to that observed in the FACS analysis (Fig. 2). Monensin did not significantly increase the amount of MOR363D detected intracellularly (Fig. 4, A and C). These observations indicated that the internalized MOR363D did not undergo any detectable degradation or recycling during the 2 h of etorphine treatment. For wild type MOR, ∼40% receptors were present intracellularly after 30 min of etorphine treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). This level was similar to that observed in FACS analysis (Fig. 2). However, only ∼20% MOR were observed after2hof etorphine treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). This level was significantly less than that observed after 30 min of etorphine treatment (p < 0.05). Pre-incubation with monensin dramatically maintained the intracellular level of the internalized receptors (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the internalized receptors disappeared in the absence of monensin were recycled back to the cell surface, where the biotin labels can be stripped. To further confirm that internalized MOR363D receptor does not recycle back to cell surface, we examined the fate of the internalized receptor. After biotinylation of cell surface receptors, MOR- or MOR363D-expressing N2A cells were treated with 1 μm etorphine for 30 min in the presence of monensin, thus trapping the internalized receptors in endosomes. Then etorphine and monensin were removed by repeated washings, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times. Then the total and intracellularly located biotinylated receptors were determined. As shown in Fig. 5 (A, B (lower panel), and C), there was no difference in the total biotinylated MOR and MOR363D during the incubation periods, demonstrating that there was no detectable degradation. For MOR, the amount of internalized receptors decreased with time (Fig. 5, A, upper panel, and D). After 3 h, a 36 ± 5.6% decrease of internal receptors was observed. Conversely, there was no significant change in the amount of internalized MOR363D after prolonged incubation (Fig. 5, B, upper panel, and D). After 3 h of incubation, 105 ± 13% of biotinylated MOR363D remained intracellularly. These observations provide substantial evidence that wild type MOR recycled back to the surface after agonist-induced internalization, whereas MOR363D did not. Resensitization of MOR and MOR363D—To determine whether receptor recycling contributes to resensitization, the ability of the previously desensitized receptor to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was measured. Receptor desensitization was first induced by 4 h exposure to 1 μm etorphine, and the cells were further incubated for 10, 20, 30, or 60 min in an agonist-free medium at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 6, 20 min after agonist withdrawal, wild type MOR resensitized significantly. 1 μm etorphine could inhibit the forskolin-stimulated cAMP production by 92 ± 3.1% of the maximal inhibition rate observed in controlled cells. The process of resensitization was almost complete during 60 min of incubation after etorphine withdrawal. In contrast, no obvious resensitization was observed after 60 min of agonist withdrawal for the MOR363D receptors (Fig. 6), corresponding with a poor recycling process. These findings suggest that receptor recycling resulted in the resensitization of the μ-opioid receptor. Truncation of the carboxyl tail sequence after Ser363, which removes the putative phosphorylation sites, resulted in the failure of etorphine to induce receptor phosphorylation. Absence of receptor phosphorylation was accompanied by the attenuation in the receptor ability to recruit β-arrestin, subsequently the rate but not the magnitude of etorphine-induced receptor internalization was reduced. Our current observations are in agreement with the model that phosphorylation of GPCR enhances the affinity of the receptor for β-arrestin (3Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). However, the fact that the magnitude of MOR363D internalization was unchanged when compared with wild type MOR demonstrated that phosphorylation is not an absolute requirement for agonist-induced receptor internalization, and rather, is a facilitory factor for internalization of MOR. This observation is consistent with a previous study that a mutant MOR with all major phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine still shows around 20% internalization after 1 h of agonist exposure (16El-Kouhen R. Burd A.L. Erickson-Herbrandson L.J. Chang C.Y. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12774-12780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Another mutant MOR that exhibits receptor phosphorylation upon agonist activation does not undergo endocytosis (19Burd A.L. El-Kouhen R. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34488-34495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that receptor phosphorylation is not essential for agonist-induced internalization of MOR. Our data did not preclude the critical role of C terminus in internalization that has been suggested in multiple studies (16El-Kouhen R. Burd A.L. Erickson-Herbrandson L.J. Chang C.Y. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12774-12780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Burd A.L. El-Kouhen R. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 1998; 54: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MOR363D contains two important residues, Ser356 and Ser363, which are identified to be involved in the endocytosis of MOR (19Burd A.L. El-Kouhen R. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34488-34495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), explaining why MOR363D undergoes internalization, and also suggesting that the certain residues in the C terminus trigger internalization through unphosphorylated pathway(s). Our current studies could not exclude definitely the interaction between MOR363D and β-arrestin. Previous studies showed that β-arrestin is required to terminate the GPCR signaling by uncoupling the receptor from G proteins and by targeting the desensitized receptor to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis (12Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Bodduluri S.R. Laporte S.A. Law P.Y. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7157-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 30Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 31Nakamura K. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24346-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). And β-arrestin can still interact with agonist-occupied unphosphorylated receptor, just with less efficiency (32Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that the truncation after Ser363 reduces the affinity of arrestin for receptor and β-arrestin still binds to unphosphorylated MOR363D and is involved in the internalization. This suggestion is supported by the observation that the truncated MOR363D underwent a slower internalization. With this hypothesis, our results are not in conflict with the fact that chronic morphine treatment fails to elicit desensitization in β-arrestin 2 knockout mice in which β-arrestin 2 is totally depleted (33Bohn L.M Gainetdinov R.R. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Consistent with a previous report (34Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that MOR binds poorly to G protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein, a newly found postendocytic sorting protein that directs receptors to lysosome for degradation, MOR did not exhibit detectable degradation after internalization. But the internalized MOR363D with the unphosphorylated tail did not recycle, either, indicating depletion of a sorting process that directs receptors to the recycling endosomes. Several studies suggest a dual role of β-arrestin in the regulation of GPCR function (30Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 35Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). On one hand, as mentioned above, β-arrestin terminates the GPCR signaling. On the other hand, several studies suggest a role of β-arrestin in dictating receptor recycling. Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant β-arrestin 1-V53D impairs dephosphorylation and resensitization of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) (35Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The ability of a β2AR mutant (Y326A), which does not resensitize after desensitization, to resensitize can be rescued by overexpression of β-arrestin 1 (35Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), demonstrating that β-arrestin is a critical determinant for resensitization. This is further supported by the observation that a specific arrestin interacting motif in the GPCR carboxyl-terminal tail dictates the rate of receptor dephosphorylation, recycling, and resensitization (36Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Moreover, the carboxyl-terminal tails of some GPCRs have a great influence on the sorting of these internalized GPCRs to recycling pathways (37Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 38Baratti-Elbaz C. Ghinea N. Lahuna O. Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1751-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and even two distinct structural motifs have been identified to direct the sorting of internalized hormone receptor from degradation to recycling (39Kishi M. Liu X. Hirakawa T. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1624-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taken together, we propose that the mutual interaction between specific motif(s) in the C terminus of the wild type MOR and β-arrestin, which is promoted by phosphorylation, directs the internalized receptors to recycling pathway. We favor this hypothesis by the fact that MOR363D receptors, missing the distal portion of C terminus and binding poorly with β-arrestin, did not undergo recycling. Our data also suggest that the specific motif(s) dictating the intracellular fate of receptor is/are probably located in the distal portion of the C-terminal tail after Ser363. In the present study, we measured the long-term desensitization that is affected greatly by the receptor internalization and its intracellular sorting. In a previous study (27Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), trapping of the internalized receptors at endosomes with monensin enhances the rate and magnitude of agonist-induced receptor desensitization. Current studies verify that the agonist-induced MOR desensitization was partially reversed by the recycling and activation of internalized receptor to cell surface. Unphosphorylation and subsequently poor recruitment of β-arrestin resulted in the inability of MOR363D to resensitize and consequently enhanced the agonist-induced desensitization. Thus, the rate of desensitization is affected greatly by the rate of resensitization. These results suggest that the dynamic nature of receptor internalization, recycling, and resensitization, not the uncoupling of the receptor after phosphorylation, is critical for desensitization development. In conclusion, the truncation of carboxyl tail blocked the receptor phosphorylation and reduced the β-arrestin-receptor interaction, and subsequently the rate of receptor internalization, but did not reduce the magnitude of internalization. The failure to phosphorylate in the presence of agonist and the reduction in arrestin recruitment result in the abolishment of the ability of receptors to recycle and resensitize, thus increasing the rate of desensitization. However, the molecular mechanism of receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment in receptor recycling needs to be clarified. Nevertheless, this study provides new insights into how MOR phosphorylation might regulate desensitization differentially in opioid receptors."

A broad variety of agonists has been attributed to TLR2 and three TLRs, TLR4, TLR2, and TLR5, have been demonstrated to bind microbial products. Distinct agonists might interact with different subdomains of the TLR2 extracellular domain. The TLR2 extracellular domain sequence includes 10 canonical leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs and 8-10 additional and potentially functionally relevant LRR-like motifs. Thus, the transfection of TLR2 LRR/LRR-like motif deletion constructs in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and primary TLR2-deficient mouse fibroblasts was performed for analysis of the role of the regarding domains in specific pattern recognition. Preparations applied as agonists were highly purified soluble peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, outer surface protein A from Borrelia burgdorferi, synthetic mycoplasmal macrophage-activating lipoprotein-2, tripalmitoyl-cysteinyl-seryl-(lysyl)3-lysine (P3CSK4), dipalmitoyl-CSK4 (P2-CSK4), and monopalmitoyl-CSK4 (PCSK4) as well as lipopolysaccharide and inactivated bacteria. We found that a block of the N-terminal seven LRR/LRR-like motifs was not involved in TLR2-mediated cell activation by P3CSK4 and P2CSK4 ligands mimicking triacylated and diacylated bacterial polypeptides, respectively. In contrast, the integrity of the TLR2 holoprotein was compulsory for effective cellular recognition of other TLR2 agonists applied, including PCSK4. The formation of a functionally relevant subdomain by a region including the N-terminal seven LRR/LRR-like motifs rather than by single LRRs is suggested by our results. They further imply that TLR2 contains multiple binding domains for ligands that may contribute to the characterization of its promiscuous molecular pattern recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2002802503,"Tropomodulin 1 (Tmod1) is a ∼40-kDa tropomyosin binding and actin filament pointed end-capping protein that regulates pointed end dynamics and controls thin filament length in striated muscle. In vitro, the capping affinity of Tmod1 for tropomyosin-actin filaments (Kd ∼ 50 pm) is several thousand-fold greater than for capping of pure actin filaments (Kd ∼ 0.1 μm). The tropomyosin-binding region of Tmod1 has been localized to the amino-terminal portion between residues 1 and 130, but the location of the actin-capping domain is not known. We have now identified two distinct actin-capping regions on Tmod1 by testing a series of recombinant Tmod1 fragments for their ability to inhibit actin elongation from gelsolin-actin seeds using pyrene-actin polymerization assays. The carboxyl-terminal portion of Tmod1 (residues 160–359) contains the principal actin-capping activity (Kd ∼ 0.4 μm), requiring residues between 323 and 359 for full activity, whereas the amino-terminal portion of Tmod1 (residues 1–130) contains a second, weaker actin-capping activity (Kd ∼ 1.8 μm). Interestingly, 160–359 but not 1–130 enhances spontaneous actin nucleation, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal domain may bind to two actin subunits across the actin helix at the pointed end, whereas the amino-terminal domain may bind to only one actin subunit. On the other hand, the actin-capping activity of the amino-terminal but not the carboxyl-terminal portion of Tmod1 is enhanced several thousand-fold in the presence of skeletal muscle tropomyosin. We conclude that the carboxyl-terminal capping domain of Tmod1 contains a TM-independent actin pointed end-capping activity, whereas the amino-terminal domain contains a TM-regulated pointed end actin-capping activity.

Tropomodulins (Tmods) 1The abbreviations used are: Tmod, tropomodulin; E, N, U, and Sk-Tmod, erythrocyte, neural, ubiquitous, skeletal tropomodulin, respectively; TM, tropomyosin; mAb9, monoclonal antibody 9; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. are a conserved family of actin filament pointed end-capping proteins that are present in vertebrates, flies, and worms. In vertebrates, there are four canonical ∼40-kDa isoforms: E, N, U, and Sk-Tmod (Tmod1 to -4, respectively), which are about 60–70% identical to one another and are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated fashion (1Almenar-Queralt A.

Tmod function in vivo is best understood in striated muscle cells, where Tmod1 or Tmod4 is associated with the free, pointed ends of thin filaments in sarcomeres and functions to regulate pointed end dynamics and control filament length (1Almenar-Queralt A.

Whereas the functions of Tmods in non-muscle cells are less well understood, recent work from our laboratory indicates that the Tmod3 isoform is present in the leading lamellipodia in human microvascular endothelial cells, where it reduces pointed end disassembly and negatively regulates cell migration (8Fischer R.S. Fritz-Six K.L. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the brain, the Tmod2 isoform may play a role in synaptic plasticity, based on characterization of behavioral deficits and enhanced long term potentiation in a Tmod2 knockout mouse (9Cox P.R. Fowler V.M. Xu B. Sweatt J.D. Paylor R. Zoghbi H.Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Tmods are unique in several respects as compared with all other capping proteins. First, Tmods bind specifically to actin filament pointed ends but not to actin monomers, sides of filaments, or barbed filament ends (10Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Second, Tmods cap pointed ends transiently, thus slowing down monomer addition and leading to an increased proportion of filaments with terminal ADP-actin subunits that have a lower affinity for ends (12Weber A. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34637-34645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The consequence is that at high Tmod concentrations, there is net actin depolymerization and filament shortening until a new steady state is achieved. Third, Tmods are unique among all capping proteins in that they also bind to tropomyosins (TM) (10Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Sussman M.A. Fowler V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Watakabe A. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and their capping activity is enhanced several thousand-fold in the presence of TM (1Almenar-Queralt A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34637-34645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 2Tmods can bind to both muscle and non-muscle TMs, but for simplicity in this study, “TM” is used to refer to skeletal muscle tropomyosin unless otherwise indicated. However, Tmod capping of TM-actin filament pointed ends does not affect the pointed end critical concentration, because the tightly capped TM-actin ends do not exchange actin subunits and thus are silent. We have proposed that TM enhances the actin-capping activity of Tmod by providing a second binding site for Tmod at the filament pointed end. However, it is also possible that TM binding to Tmod leads to a conformational change in the Tmod that increases its affinity for actin at the pointed ends. The role of TM binding for Tmod function in vivo is not known. Recent biophysical and biochemical studies indicate that the amino-terminal region of Tmod1 is highly protease-sensitive and unstructured, whereas the carboxyl-terminal portion is compact, folded, and protease-resistant (15Kostyukova A. Maeda K. Yamauchi E. Krieger I. Maeda Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6470-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Kostyukova A. Tiktopulo E.I. Maeda Y. Biophys.

The carboxyl-terminal portion (residues 160–344) of chicken Tmod1 (residues 1–359) has been crystallized, and its structure has been solved to a resolution of 1.45 Å (19Krieger I. Kostyukova A. Yamashita A. Nitanai Y. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2716-2725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This reveals that the carboxyl-terminal domain is composed of a series of five leucine-rich repeats, each consisting of an α-helix/β-sheet pair. The five leucine-rich repeats are followed by a nonhomologous, associated α-helix (α6) composed of residues 322–344. The structure of the final 15 amino acids (345–359) at the carboxyl terminus of Tmod1 is not known, since they were not present in the recombinant protein used for crystallization by Krieger et al. (19Krieger I. Kostyukova A. Yamashita A. Nitanai Y. Maeda Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2716-2725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The TM-binding region of Tmod1 and Tmod4 is located in the amino-terminal portion between residues 1 and 130 (15Kostyukova A. Maeda K. Yamauchi E. Krieger I. Maeda Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6470-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Greenfield N.J. Fowler V.M. Biophys.

Chem. 1992; 267: 2616-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed some time ago that the carboxyl-terminal half of Tmod1 contained the actin pointed end-capping domain, based on the ability of a monoclonal antibody (mAb9) that bound to this region of Tmod1 to inhibit pointed end-capping activity (5Gregorio C.C. Weber A. Bondad M. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified directly the actin pointed end-capping regions on Tmod1 by designing a series of recombinant fragments based on the domain structure of Tmod1 and testing them for their ability to inhibit actin elongation from the pointed ends of gelsolin-capped actin filaments in pyrene-actin polymerization assays. These experiments demonstrate that a TM-independent pointed end-capping activity for pure actin filaments is associated with the extreme carboxyl-terminal end of Tmod1, whereas a TM-regulated actin-capping activity is located in the unstructured TM-binding region in the amino-terminal portion of Tmod1. Unexpectedly, we also report that the full-length Tmod1 protein as well as the carboxyl-terminal domain enhances spontaneous actin nucleation, whereas the amino-terminal domain does not. These results suggest that 1) Tmod1 has two actin binding domains that interact with two different sites on actin filament pointed ends and 2) TM-binding by Tmod1 most likely enhances Tmod1 capping by enhancing the actin capping affinity of the Tmod1 amino-terminal actin-capping domain rather than by providing a separate TM-binding site for Tmod1 at the filament end. These biochemical results will provide a foundation for future exploration of the role of TM in regulation of actin-capping activities by Tmod1 in vivo. Construction of cDNAs and Expression of Recombinant Tmod1 Fragments—Full-length chicken Tmod1 (E-Tmod) (accession number L36678) was inserted in frame in the pGEX-KG vector so as to code for a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) on the amino-terminal end of Tmod1 (20Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding GST fusion proteins with various Tmod1 fragments were inserted in the EcoRI and/or NcoI sites in the linker region of the pGEX-KG vector using the polymerase chain reaction with appropriate primers. The use of different insertion sites in the linker region for the truncated Tmod1 cDNAs resulted in some amino acid differences in the sequence of the linker remaining on the amino-terminal end of the purified Tmod1 after removal of the GST moiety as well as a few additional vector-derived amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal end of some of the Tmod1 fragments (Table I).Table IRecombinant Tmod1 fragments used in this studyTmod1 fragmentM raMolecular weights for purified recombinant proteins including linker and vector derived sequences.plAbs0.1%280Amino acid sequencebAmino acid sequences in boldface are the amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences of Tmod1 or Tmod1 fragments.

Open table in a new tab Transformed Escherichia coli (BL21(DE3)) cells were grown to an A 605 of 1.2–1.5 before inducing with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galacto-pyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by lysis and purification using a modification of a previously described procedure (20Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27510-27518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After affinity purification of the GST fusion protein on a glutathione column, the Tmod1 or fragment was released from the GST moiety by cleavage with thrombin for 30 min at 22 °C, using 12.5 units thrombin for each 2 liters of bacterial extract loaded onto 10–15 ml of beads. Thrombin concentration and cleavage times were adjusted for each fragment to maximize release from the GST moiety while minimizing internal proteolysis by thrombin. After elution from the beads, 50 units of recombinant hirudin (Calbiochem) were added to terminate thrombin cleavage and to prevent Tmod1 proteolysis by residual thrombin during subsequent purification steps. Tmod1 or fragments were dialyzed into 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2.5 mm EDTA and purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences), eluting with a 10–300 mm NaCl gradient in the above buffer, followed by chromatography on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences), eluting with the same gradient. Tmod1 fragments 130–359, 160–359, and 160–344 with neutral or basic pI values were dialyzed into 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, buffer followed by purification on a Mono S (Amersham Biosciences) cation exchange column, eluting with a 10–300 mm NaCl gradient. Fractions containing Tmod1 or fragments were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining, pooled, and dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.02% sodium azide and stored frozen at –80 °C. All of the fragments used in this study were soluble and well behaved, as expected from the previous biophysical studies, and yields ranged from 2 to 10 mg from 2 liters of bacterial extract, depending on the fragment. Before use in experiments, proteins were dialyzed and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to remove minor amounts of aggregated material resulting from freezing and thawing, and their concentrations were redetermined. Protein concentrations were determined by light absorption at A 280 based on the extinction coefficients calculated from the amino acid composition of the purified fragments as described by Gill and Von Hippel (22Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) using the ProtParam tool available on the World Wide Web at expasy.org/tools/protparam.html. The molecular weights, pI values, extinction coefficients, and amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences for Tmod1 and Tmod1 fragments used in this study are summarized in Table I. Preparation of Actin, TM, and Gelsolin—Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from rabbit muscle acetone powder by the method of Spudich and Watt (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by gel filtration over Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (24Fowler V.M. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5978-5989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-actin was stored by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and defrosted as described (25Young C. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Before use, actin was dialyzed for 3–4 days at 4 °C into 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 1.0 m DTT, 0.02% sodium azide) followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 450,000 × g in a Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor to remove filaments and small oligomers that had formed during freezing and thawing. G-actin was stored on ice and used for up to 6 days. Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared as previously described (26Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 27Northrop J. Weber A. Mooseker M.S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Bishop M.F. Dubyak G.R. Tucker M. Walsh T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9274-9281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stored and treated as for unlabeled actin. Chicken skeletal muscle TM was prepared according to Smillie (28Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and stored as the lyophilized powder. Gelsolin was a gift from J. Bryan (Baylor College of Medicine, Dallas, TX) and was prepared as described (29Bryan J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined for actin and gelsolin by light absorption, using E 290 = 24.9 mm–1 cm–1 and E 280 = 150 mm–1 cm–1, respectively, and for TM by Lowry's method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Actin Polymerization Measurements—Measurements of elongation rates at the pointed end were carried out using 8–12% pyrenyl-actin and gelsolin-capped actin filaments as nuclei for polymerization (11Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 12Weber A. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34637-34645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, fluorescence was followed on a PerkinElmer 650S fluorometer and detected using a chart recorder (excitation = 366.5 nm, emission = 407 nm). Photobleaching was minimized by setting the excitation slit width to 2 nm and using a neutral density filter in the excitation light path (30Pollard T.D. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In subsequent (most) experiments, fluorescence was followed using a Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer (excitation slit 0.5 nm, emission slit 5 nm) (Jobin Yvon Horiba, Edison, NJ), and data were collected using DataMax software. For assays in the absence of TM, gelsolin-actin seeds were prepared by copolymerizing 10 μm G-actin with 1 μm gelsolin in the presence of calcium (actin/gelsolin, 10:1) and used for up to 4 days. For each time course, Ca2+-actin was first converted to Mg2+-actin by incubation for 10 min at 20 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.05 m MgCl2 and EGTA present at 2–3-fold in excess over the CaCl2 contributed by the actin buffer (25Young C. Southwick F.S. Weber A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2232-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Tmod1 or fragments and gelsolin/actin seeds were added in succession, and then polymerization was initiated by the addition of one-sixteenth volume of 16× polymerizing salts (1.65 m KCl, 33 mm MgCl2, 8.0 mm ATP, 3.3 mm CaCl2) and followed at 20 ° in the fluorometer. The final concentrations of components in the assays were as follows: 2.5 μm G-actin, 10–20 nm gelsolin/actin seeds, and Tmod1 or fragments as indicated in the figure legends. The buffer was 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 m CaCl2, 1 mm DTT. Capping activities for Tmod1 and fragments were obtained from the initial elongation rates, measured directly from the slopes of the polymerization traces over the first 30 s to 1 min of polymerization. Rates in the presence of Tmod1 or fragments were divided by the rate for actin in the absence of Tmod1, giving a rate/control rate. The Kd values for full-length Tmod1 and each fragment were then calculated from the x intercept of a double reciprocal plot of 1/(1 – (rate/control rate)) versus 1/Tmod1 concentration. Although the absolute Kd values varied somewhat between different experiments, the relative differences in capping activities of the fragments as compared with full-length Tmod1 were very similar in each experiment. The variability for determination of the Kd values in these assays is most likely due to a variable efficiency of barbed end capping by gelsolin from one experiment to the next. Any free barbed ends will lead to a background of fluorescence increase due to barbed end elongation, which will lead to a falsely low readout for the pointed end-capping activity by Tmod1 and thus an apparently higher Kd value. Experiments measuring the effects of Tmod1 fragments on elongation rates in the presence of TM were generously carried out by Dr. Annemarie Weber at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA). Actin/gelsolin seeds (150:1) were copolymerized with TM, and additional TM was also added along with the Tmod1 or fragments in the polymerization mixtures to ensure that newly elongating filaments were also coated with TM (12Weber A. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34637-34645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was followed using a Photon Technology International fluorometer (Princeton, NJ). Elongation rates in the presence of TM and Tmod1 were measured from the flat portion of the curve after the inhibition of the polymerization rate by Tmod1 was maximal (e.g. see Fig. 4 in Ref. 12Weber A.

The effects of Tmod1 or fragments on spontaneous actin polymerization were examined by polymerizing 5 μm G-actin (8–10% pyrenyl-actin) in the presence or absence of Tmod1 or fragments. G-actin was first converted from Ca2+-actin to Mg2+-actin as described above, and then the indicated concentrations of Tmod1 or fragments were added (see Fig. 8 legend) followed immediately by one-tenth volume of 10× polymerizing buffer (1.0 m KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm ATP, 50 mm EGTA) and incubation at 20 °C in the spectrofluorometer cuvette. The time course of fluorescence increase was monitored in a Fluoromax-3 fluorometer with the excitation slit at 0.25 nm and the emission slit at 10 nm to minimize photobleaching. The concentration of barbed ends was calculated from the elongation rate (measured by the rate of polymerization, where 50% of monomers were polymerized) using the equation, [Barbedends]=Rateofpolymerization(μM/s)/(k+[G-actin])(Eq. 1) where k + = 10 μm–1 s–1 (31Pollard T.D.

Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and blots were preheated at 65 °C in PBS followed by staining with Ponceau S to detect proteins (32Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12792-12800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before labeling with a monoclonal antibody to tropomodulin (mAb9) (5Gregorio C.C. Weber A. Bondad M. Pennise C.R. Fowler V.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and detection by standard chemiluminescence procedures. CD Experiments—CD measurements of fragments 160–344 and 160–359 were performed on an Aviv model 62 D spectrophotometer in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 10 °C. The secondary structure of these fragments were estimated using the programs CDNN (33Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) and Selcon 1 (34Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10022-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Two different sets of standards were used with the Selcon program. The first contained 17 proteins where secondary structures were calculated as described by Kabsch and Sander (35Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12421) Google Scholar), and the second had 33 reference proteins where the secondary structures were calculated as described by Toumadje et al. (36Toumadje A. Alcorn S.W. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) as reviewed by Greenfield (37Greenfield N.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Determination of the Free Energy of Folding of Peptide Fragments— The free energy of folding of fragments 160–344 and 160–359 were determined as described by Santoro and Bolen (38Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar), assuming that the free energy of folding is linearly dependent on the concentration of a chemical denaturant. In these experiments, a stock solution of 6 m guanidine HCl containing 10 μm peptide, 100 μm NaCl, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, was used to titrate a 10 μm solution of each peptide, and the ellipticity (θobs) was recorded at each concentration of guanidine [Gn i ]. The data were fit to the equation, θobs={exp(-(ΔGo+M[Gni])/(RT))/(exp(-(ΔGo+M[Gni])/(RT))+1)}(θf-θu)+θu(Eq. 2) where ΔGo is the free energy of folding in the absence of denaturant, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (Kelvin), θobs is the observed ellipticity at any concentration of guanidine HCl, [Gn i ], M is slope of the linear change in free energy as a function of [Gn i ], and θ f and θ u are the ellipticity of the fully folded and fully unfolded peptides at 10 °C. To solve the equation's initial values of ΔGo, M, θ f , and θ u were estimated, and the best fits to the data were evaluated using the Levenberg-Marquardt (39Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Indust Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar) algorithm implemented in SigmaPlot 8.0 (SpSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Recombinant Tmod1 Fragments—We chose to prepare a series of fragments from the chicken Tmod1 isoform (E-Tmod), since most of the previous structural and functional studies have been performed with this protein. Fig. 1 is a schematic depicting the locations of the fragments that we tested, with respect to the known structural features of Tmod1. In general, most fragments corresponded to the domain organization of Tmod1. Thus, the fragments 35–359, 95–359, and 130–359 all contained the compact, folded carboxyl-terminal domain but were missing increasingly greater amounts of the amino-terminal unstructured, TM-binding portion of Tmod1 (15Kostyukova A.

https://openalex.org/W2051434743,"Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation contribute to neointimal hyperplasia and vascular stenosis after endothelial denudation. Previous studies revealed that apolipoprotein E (apoE) is an effective inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor-directed smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation and that the anti-migratory function is mediated via apoE binding to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1). This study was undertaken to identify the intracellular pathway by which apoE binding to LRP-1 results in inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration. The results showed that apoE increased intracellular cAMP levels 3-fold after 5 min, and the increase was sustained for more than 1 h. As a consequence, apoE also increased protein kinase A (PKA) activity in smooth muscle cells. Importantly, suppression of PKA activity with a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of PKA abolished the inhibitory effect of apoE on smooth muscle cell migration. These results indicated that apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration is mediated via the activation of cAMP-dependent PKA. Additional experiments revealed that apoE also inhibited fibroblasts migration toward platelet-derived growth factor by a similar mechanism of cAMP-dependent PKA activation. It is noteworthy that apoE failed to increase cAMP levels or inhibit migration of LRP-1-negative mouse embryonic fibroblasts and LRP-1-deficient smooth muscle cells. Taken together, these findings established the mechanism by which apoE inhibits cell migration, i.e. via cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activation as a consequence of its binding to LRP-1.

Transgenic mice overexpressing rat apoE displayed marked resistance to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and did not develop atherosclerosis (1Shimano H. Yamada N. Katsuki M. Yamamoto K. Gotoda T.

Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice with targeted disruption of the apoE gene developed spontaneous atherosclerosis even under basal low fat/low cholesterol dietary conditions (3Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A.

Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). Atherosclerosis in apoE-null mice could be prevented by increasing circulating apoE levels through recombinant adenovirus-mediated apoE gene transfer to the liver (5Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrott C.L. Applebaum-Bowden D. Meyn S. Talley G. Paigen B. Maeda N. Brewer H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The decrease in atherosclerosis in this model was accompanied by decreased total cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein, and intermediate density lipoprotein levels (5Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrott C.L. Applebaum-Bowden D. Meyn S. Talley G. Paigen B. Maeda N. Brewer H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although these results seemed to suggest that apoE prevents atherosclerosis by lowering plasma cholesterol levels, atherosclerosis was found to be more severe in cholesterol-fed apoE +/- mice than in cholesterol-fed apoE +/+ mice despite the relative similar plasma cholesterol level in the two groups (4Plump A.S.

Burkey B. Maeda N. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additionally, transgenic expression of apoE in the arterial wall inhibited atheroma formation and severity without affecting plasma cholesterol level in cholesterol-fed C57BL/6 mice (1Shimano H. Yamada N. Katsuki M. Yamamoto K. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Yazaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1750-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that low levels of apoE secreted by the adrenal gland also inhibited atherosclerosis without correcting for hypercholesterolemia in apoE-deficient mice (7Thorngate F.E. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Williams D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taken together, this lack of correlation between total cholesterol and atherosclerosis lesion suggests that apoE may have direct impact on atherosclerosis by mechanisms independent of its ability to modulate plasma lipid levels. The precise mechanism by which apoE protects against vascular diseases independent of its effects on cholesterol metabolism is not completely understood. The migration of vascular smooth muscle cells from the media to the intima followed by their proliferation are hallmarks of atherosclerotic lesions and vascular stenosis after balloon angioplasty and/or stent implantation. Our laboratory has shown previously that apoE inhibits PDGF-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation (8Ishigami M. Swertfeger D.K. Granholm N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol.

Our recent data also revealed that apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation is mediated through nitric-oxide synthase activation as a consequence of its binding to cell surface proteoglycans (9Ishigami M.

The mechanism by which LRP-1 modulates apoE inhibition of cell migration has not been identified to date. In view of recent reports of LRP-1 association with a stimulatory heterotrimeric G-protein and activation of downstream protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent pathways (12Goretzki L. Mueller B.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), this study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that apoE inhibition of cell migration is mediated through the activation of cAMP/PKA pathways. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, and recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) were purchased from Invitrogen. The cell-permeable myristoylated protein kinase A inhibitory peptide (PKI) was obtained from Calbiochem. Forskolin was bought from Sigma. Direct cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit was obtained from Assay Designs Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). The PKA assay kit was obtained from MBL International. Transwell polycarbonate membrane filters were purchased from Corning Costar Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Wild type murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF-1), the heterozygous LRP-deficient fibroblasts PEA-10, and the homozygous LRP-negative fibroblasts PEA-13 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The Silencer™ siRNA construction kit was obtained from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX), and the Nucleofector™ transfection device and AoSMC Nucleofector™ reagent kit were purchased from Amaxa Biosystems (Gaithersburg, MD). Apolipoprotein E Isolation—Human apoE was isolated from fresh plasma from healthy volunteers by the method of Rall et al. (13Rall S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The purity of apoE was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and samples containing only a single band with M r = 34,000 were used. In most experiments, purified apoE was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and added directly to the culture medium without reconstitution with lipid. In selected experiments, lipid-reconstituted apoE was prepared by the cholate dialysis method before use. The apoE-lipid emulsion complex was prepared by drying 3 mg of egg phosphatidylcholine and 60 μg of cholesterol in chloroform:methanol (2:1 v:v) under a stream of nitrogen and then dissolving the thin lipid film in a 300-μl solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 32 mg of cholate, and 300 μg of apoE. The lipid-protein mixture was incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature and then dialyzed exhaustively against 3 changes of buffered saline before use. Isolation of Mouse Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells—Aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated from C57BL/6 wild type mice using a modification of Mimura's procedure (14Mimura Y. Kobayashi S. Notoya K. Okabe M. Kimura I. Horikoshi I. Kimura M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1995; 18: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, thoracic aortas were dissected from mice, and the adventitial tissue was trimmed away. The aortas were then incubated in Hanks' solution containing 1 mg/ml collagenase and 3.3 units/ml elastase for 30 min at 37 °C. The adventitial tissue was dissected away, and the remaining tissue was incubated in Hanks' solution containing collagenase (1 mg/ml) and elastase (3.3 units/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell clumps were dissociated by aspiration through a 10-ml pipette. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 150 × g for 5 min at room temperature and resuspended in 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The isolated cells were characterized as smooth muscle cells based on positive immunohistochemistry staining with smooth muscle α-actin-specific antibodies and by morphological characteristics similar to that observed with human smooth muscle cells. The primary smooth muscle cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells between passages 1 and 4 were used for experiments. Fibroblasts Cell Culture—The wild type MEF-1, heterozygous LRP-deficient PEA-10, and the homozygous LRP-negative PEA-13 fibroblasts were grown in monolayer cultures on plastic tissue culture-treated dishes or multiple well cluster plates in high glucose DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 90% air, 10% CO2 atmosphere. Cells between passages 3–12 were made quiescent by incubation for 48 h in the presence of 0.4% fetal bovine serum before use. Cell Migration Assay—Migration of mouse vascular smooth muscle cells and embryonic fibroblasts toward a PDGF-BB gradient was examined according to the procedure of Law et al. (15Law R.E. Meehan W.P.

Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were made quiescent by incubation with DMEM and 0.4% fetal bovine serum for 48 h before and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a 1-ml medium solution with or without apoE. A 0.1-ml aliquot of the cell suspension was added to the top chamber of tissue culture-treated Transwell polycarbonate membrane with 8-μm pores in 24-well plates. The lower Transwell compartment contained 0.6 ml of DMEM, 0.4% fetal bovine serum, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin with or without 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. After incubating for 4 h at 37 °C, the upper surface of the filters was washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then fixed with methanol for 10 min at 4 °C followed by hematoxylin staining. The number of cells that migrated to the lower surface of each filter was counted in different high power fields at a magnification of 320. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Direct cAMP Measurement—Smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts were seeded into 6-well plates. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were made quiescent by incubation with DMEM and 0.4% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Cells were incubated in culture medium with or without apoE. The reaction was stopped by aspiration of the incubation medium followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 m HCl. Cell lysis was achieved after incubation at 37 °C for an additional 10 min. The lysed cells were scraped into Eppendorf tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 1300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used to determine cAMP concentration using a direct enzyme immunoassay kit by the procedure as described by the manufacturer. Total protein concentration in each sample was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. The cAMP level in each sample was normalized to the protein concentration and expressed as pmol/mg of protein. Protein Kinase A Activity Assay—Protein kinase A activity was determined using the PKA assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were grown to monolayers in 6-well plates. After 48 h of incubation in DMEM containing 0.4% fetal bovine serum, the cells were incubated with or without apoE for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing a complete proteinase inhibitor mixture. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was divided into aliquots in triplicate on a 96-well microtiter plate coated with the immobilized PKA substrate peptide (RFARKGSLRQKNV) for 10 min. This reaction was stopped by adding 20% H3PO4. Phosphorylation was quantified by adding a biotinylated anti-phosphorylated PKA substrate peptide antibody 2B9 followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Color development was achieved by O-phenylenediamine and hydrogen peroxide, and optical density was measured at 492 nm in a spectrophotometer. Generation of LRP-1-deficient Smooth Muscle Cells—Knockdown of LRP-1 gene expression in smooth muscle cells was accomplished by transfecting aortic smooth muscle cells with LRP-1-specific siRNA. The siRNA was synthesized with the aid of the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion Inc) using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the T7 promoter sequence, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ and the sense and antisense sequence to residues 557–577 of LRP-1, 5′-GAGACCAAATCACCTGTATCTCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′ and 5′-TTGAGATACAGGTGATTTGGTCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′, respectively. Five μg of the siRNA was transfected into primary smooth muscle cells using the Nucleofector kit specific for transfecting smooth muscle cells. The cells were made quiescent 24 h after transfection by incubating for 48 h with DMEM and 0.4% fetal bovine serum. Half of the transfected cells were used for experiments to determine apoE effects on intracellular cAMP. The remaining cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and 30 μg of the cell lysate was analyzed for LRP-1 expression by Western blot with the 11H4 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the 85-kDa subunit of LRP-1 as described (11Swertfeger D.K. Bu G. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4141-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Effects of ApoE on Intracellular cAMP Level and PKA Activity in Primary Smooth Muscle Cells—Previous studies show that LRP-1 ligands such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator and lactoferrin increased cAMP levels and induced PKA activity in cultured melanoma and hepatoma cells (12Goretzki L. Mueller B.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, whether apoE binding to LRP-1 also elicits cAMP accumulation and PKA induction is unknown. More importantly, the physiological significance of the LRP-1 ligand-induced cAMP accumulation and PKA activation has not been established. Because the cAMP/PKA pathway has been shown to regulate smooth muscle cells migration (16Itoh H. Yamamura S. Ware J.A. Zhuang S. Mii S. Liu B. Kent K.C. Am. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4141-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of apoE on smooth muscle cell migration is mediated through its stimulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway. The first set of experiments examined the effects of apoE on intracellular cAMP levels and PKA activity in primary smooth muscle cells in culture. The treatment of smooth muscle cells with apoE resulted in a dose-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP levels with a 4-fold increase observed at 50 μg/ml (Fig. 1A). The increase in cellular cAMP accumulation was observed within 5 min after apoE addition and was sustained for at least 1 h (Fig. 1B). The apoE-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation resulted in the activation of PKA activity in the smooth muscle cells, with a 2-fold induction observed when cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml apoE (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Effect of apoE on protein kinase A activity in smooth muscle cells. Quiescent primary culture of mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (passage 3) was incubated for 30 min with or without 25 μg/ml apoE. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. The cell lysates were used to determine protein kinase A activity based on the phosphorylation of the PKA substrate peptide (RFARKGSLRQKNV). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments. The asterisk denotes significant difference from samples incubated without apoE (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ApoE Inhibition of Smooth Muscle Cell Migration Requires PKA Activation—The intracellular cAMP accumulation and increased PKA activity in smooth muscle cells after apoE incubation suggested the possibility that apoE may inhibit smooth muscle cell migration via activation of cAMP-dependent PKA. This possibility was examined by determining the effect of a selective PKA inhibitor on apoE inhibition of PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration. Results showed that the cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of PKA, myristoylated PKI, abolished the anti-migratory property of apoE in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). These findings provided strong support for the hypothesis that the anti-migratory effect of apoE is mediated through the cAMP/PKA pathway. ApoE Induced cAMP Accumulation via Its Interaction with LRP-1—Previous studies have already shown that apoE binding to LRP-1 is required, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans are not involved, for its inhibition of PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration (11Swertfeger D.K. Bu G. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4141-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These observations along with the results reported above suggested that the apoE-induced cAMP accumulation requires the presence of LRP-1 but not heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface. This hypothesis was examined by comparing the effect of apoE on the cAMP level in normal and LRP-1-deficient smooth muscle cells. The results showed that siRNA knockdown of LRP-1 expression in smooth muscle cells abolished apoE-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4). In contrast, mock-transfected smooth muscle cells, which retained a normal level of LRP-1 expression, were responsive to apoE-induced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 4). The prior incubation of smooth muscle cells with heparanase to remove cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans also had no effect on the ability of apoE to increase intracellular cAMP level (Fig. 5). These results documented that apoE induction of cAMP accumulation in smooth muscle cells is mediated via LRP-1.Fig. 5Effect of apoE on intracellular cAMP levels in heparanase-treated smooth muscle cells. Quiescent smooth muscle cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml apoE in the presence or absence of heparanase III (1 units/ml) for 30 min. Cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.1 m HCl. The cell lysates were used immediately for cAMP determinations by enzyme immunoassay.

The initial experiments were performed to determine whether apoE also inhibits migration of fibroblasts. Results showed that apoE inhibited the migration of wild type MEF-1 fibroblasts and the heterozygous LRP-1 deficient PEA-10 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). In contrast, apoE was unable to inhibit the migration of PEA-13 cells, which are homozygous LRP-1-negative cells (Fig. 6). These results documented that apoE also inhibits fibroblast migration and the mechanism of inhibition is mediated via its binding to LRP-1, similar to that observed in smooth muscle cells (11Swertfeger D.K. Bu G. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4141-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The next series of experiments compared wild type MEF-1 and LRP-1-deficient PEA-13 cells for their response to apoE-induced cAMP accumulation. The results showed that apoE increased intracellular cAMP level in the MEF-1 cells in a time-dependent manner. A 4-fold increase in intracellular cAMP level was observed after incubating MEF-1 cells with apoE for 15 min, and the increase persisted for at least 1 h (Fig. 7). In contrast, apoE has a minimal effect on intracellular cAMP level in the LRP-1-deficient PEA-13 cells (Fig. 7). Importantly, apoE inhibition of MEF-1 fibroblast migration was also abolished by the protein kinase A inhibitor PKI (Fig. 8). These results indicated that apoE inhibition of fibroblast migration is also mediated via induction of cAMP accumulation and the consequential activation of PKA. Finally, to verify that the lack of apoE-induced cAMP accumulation in LRP-deficient cells is not a generalized phenomenon of abnormal cyclic nucleotide metabolism due to LRP-1 deficiency, we tested the effect of forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase and inhibitor of smooth muscle cell migration (17Horio T.

Results, as shown in Fig. 9, clearly demonstrated that forskolin inhibited PDGF-stimulated migration of MEF-1, PEA-10, and PEA-13 with similar efficiency. Taken together, these results documented that the pathway of apoE inhibition of cell migration is a general phenomenon in LRP-1-expressing cells, and mechanism involves induction of intracellular cAMP accumulation and the subsequent activation of PKA activity.Fig. 8Effect of protein kinase A inhibition on apoE inhibition of fibroblast migration. Quiescent wild type MEF-1 fibroblasts were incubated with apoE at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of the protein kinase A inhibitor-myristoylated PKI. At the end of the incubation period the cells were placed into the top chamber of Transwell membrane at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate. The lower chamber contained basal medium and 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Cells were incubated in the Transwell for 4 h at 37 °C. The number of cells that migrated to the lower surface was counted in different high power fields (HPF). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. (n = 6).

Thus, additional experiments were performed to determine whether lipidated apoE can also inhibit cell migration via the cAMP-dependent mechanism similar to that observed with delipidated apoE. Using wild type and LRP-1-deficient fibroblasts as a model for these experiments, results showed that both lipid-bound and lipid-free apoE were similarly effective in inhibiting PDGF-directed migration of the wild type MEF-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 10). Both lipidated and delipidated apoE were also capable of inducing intracellular cAMP accumulation in the wild type MEF-1 cells (Fig. 11). In contrast, neither form of apoE was capable of suppressing PDGF-directed migration (Fig. 10) or the induction of intracellular cAMP accumulation (Fig. 11) in LRP-1-deficient PEA-13 fibroblasts.Fig. 11Effects of lipidated and delipidated apoE on intracellular cAMP levels. Quiescent wild type MEF-1 fibroblasts (open bars) and LRP-1 negative PEA-13 fibroblasts (filled bars) were incubated for 30 min with 25 μg/ml delipidated or lipidated apoE. The cells were washed with buffered saline and lysed in 0.1 m HCl. The cell lysates were used immediately for cAMP determinations by enzyme immunoassay. Data are expressed as pmol/mg of cell protein.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25043-25048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mechanism for apoE inhibition of cell proliferation is mediated via its binding to cell surface proteoglycans (10Swertfeger D.K. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25043-25048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the subsequent activation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase activity (9Ishigami M.

However, apoE binding to cell surface proteoglycans has no effect on its ability to inhibit cell migration (10Swertfeger D.K. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25043-25048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The latter process is mediated via LRP-1 (11Swertfeger D.K. Bu G. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4141-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which apoE binding to LRP-1 results in inhibition of cell migration has not been delineated. Results of the current study documented that apoE inhibition of PDGF-induced smooth muscle cell migration is related to the activation of cAMP/PKA-signaling pathway. This conclusion is based on the observation that apoE increased intracellular cAMP level in a dose-dependent manner and the resulting increase of PKA activity in primary smooth muscle cells. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of apoE on cell migration was abolished by the specific PKA inhibitor PKI and in cells lacking a functional LRP-1. The causative effect of apoE-induced cAMP/PKA on inhibition of cell migration is consistent with the effects of other known cAMP/PKA activators on cell migration. For example, the cAMP activator forskolin as well as stable cAMP analogues such as 8-bromo-cAMP are effective inducers of PKA activity and inhibitors of smooth muscle cell migration (17Horio T. Kohno M. Kano H. Ikeda M. Yasunari K. Yokokawa K. Minami M. Takeda T. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Sun J. Sui X. Bradbury J.A. Zeldin D.C. Conte M.S. Liao J.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, adrenomedullin has also been shown to inhibit the migration of rat aortic smooth muscle cells by inducing intracellular cAMP accumulation (17Horio T. Kohno M. Kano H. Ikeda M. Yasunari K. Yokokawa K. Minami M. Takeda T. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 660-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase-derived eicosanoids have also been demonstrated to inhibit smooth muscle cell migration by increasing intracellular cAMP level and PKA activity (19Sun J. Sui X. Bradbury J.A. Zeldin D.C. Conte M.S. Liao J.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both adrenomedullin and the P450 epoxygenase-derived eicosanoids induced cAMP accumulation by stimulation of the heterotrimeric G protein Gαs (20Smith D.M. Coppock H.A. Withers D.J. Owji A.A.

Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15983-15989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Because LRP-1 also interacts with Gαs (12Goretzki L. Mueller B.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), it is possible that apoE induces intracellular cAMP accumulation and PKA activation in smooth muscle cells through similar mechanisms. Alternatively, apoE may induce cAMP accumulation and PKA activation by an indirect mechanism, possibly through the activation of protein kinase C. Previous studies demonstrated apoE induced protein kinase Cα translocation and activation in neuroblastoma cells (22Cedazo-Minguez A. Wiehager B. Winblad B. Huttinger M. Cowburn R.F. Neurochem. Int. 2001; 38: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C activation also resulted in inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration in a manner that is dependent on cAMP accumulation and PKA activity (16Itoh H. Yamamura S. Ware J.A. Zhuang S. Mii S. Liu B. Kent K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H359-H370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the apoE-induced cAMP/PKA signaling and its inhibition of cell migration is mediated through Gαs or protein kinase C activation or both remains to be determined. The results of the current study showing the inability of apoE to inhibit migration of LRP-1-negative cells are consistent with our previous observation that LRP-1 is the apoE receptor responsible for mediating its anti-migratory function (11Swertfeger D.K. Bu G. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4141-4146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results are also consistent with results showing that other LRP-1 ligands, including anti-LRP and the receptor-associated protein RAP, are also potent inhibitors of cell migration and invasion (23Okada S.S.

Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). This study showed that in smooth muscle cells and embryonic fibroblasts, LRP-1 is a signal transduction receptor mediating apoE inhibition of cell migration via activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway. The importance of LRP-1 function in limiting vascular cell activation is also evident from recent studies showing abnormal PDGF receptor signaling and increased atherosclerosis in smooth muscle-specific LRP-1 knockout mice (38Boucher P. Gotthardt M. Li W-P. Anderson R.G.W. Herz J. Science. 2003; 300: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that delipidated apoE was equally effective as apoE in lipid emulsions in the induction of cAMP/PKA pathways in LRP-positive cells but not in LRP-negative cells. These results suggest that apoE reconstitution into lipoproteins is not required for its interaction with LRP-1. This is in contrast to the requirement of lipid reconstitution for apoE interaction with the low density lipoprotein receptor. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the delipidated apoE became lipidated during its incubation with the tissue culture cells before its interaction with LRP-1, apoE prepared similarly and added to human fibroblast cell culture using an identical procedure did not interact with low density lipoprotein receptors on these cells. 2Y. Zhu and D. Y. Hui, unpublished observation. Taken together, these observations suggest that minimally lipidated apoE is sufficient to interact with LRP-1 on the cell surface. This hypothesis is consistent with results reported recently by Narita et al. (39Narita M. Holtzman D.M. Fagan A.M. LaDu M.J. Yu L. Han X. Gross R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) demonstrating the direct binding of lipid-poor apoE to LRP-1. The ability of lipid-poor apoE to interact with LRP-1 further supports our hypothesis that apoE-LRP interaction has additional cell signaling function in addition to its well documented role in lipid transport."

In addition to TACE, two other members of the ADAM family of metalloproteinases, ADAM9 and ADAM10, have also been proposed as α-secretases (18Hotoda N Koike H. Sasagawa N. Ishiura S. Biochem.

ADAM9 and ADAM10, in common with other sheddase activities, exhibit regulation by protein kinase C and inhibition by hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitors. Proteolytic processing of the APP appears to be central to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Recently it was reported that the extracellular domain of BACE1 is cleaved and released from cells in a soluble form (30Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The extent to which BACE1 shedding is regulated or the possible impact this may have on the amyloidogenic processing of APP is not known. However, it has been suggested that inhibition of BACE1 shedding could have value as an alternative strategy in the treatment of AD (30Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Here we show that BACE1 shedding is indeed increased by agents that stimulate protein kinase C and that a metalloproteinase, possibly ADAM10, is involved in this process. As BACE1 is known to be re-internalized and targeted to the endosomes (31Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), which are a major site of APP processing, it is possible that an alteration in the level of BACE1 at the cell surface would alter the levels of BACE1 available for re-internalization. This would clearly have implications for the processing of APP at the β-site and, hence, Aβ production. To address this issue, we identified BACE1 sheddase-selective hydroxamate inhibitors and investigated the effect of inhibiting BACE1 shedding on the processing of APP. Interestingly, abolishing the ectodomain shedding of BACE1 appeared to have no effect on the processing of APP at the β-site. Expression of BACE1 Constructs—BACE1-MycHis6/pcDNA3.1 has been described previously (21Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S. Murphy K.E. Southan C.D. Ryan D.M. Smith T.S. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Mutant constructs were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer and sequenced. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing wild type or mutant BACE1 or APP695 were generated using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines were generated by selection with Geneticin (G418; 600 μg/ml). Drug/Inhibitor Treatments—Cells were grown in a serum-free medium in the absence or presence of 2 μm 12-phorbol-3-myristate (PMA; Calbiochem) for 1 h or the indicated concentration of hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitors for 20 h. The medium was harvested and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min prior to analysis. Media from the 1-h treatments were concentrated 30-fold using Vivaspin 500 concentrators (Vivascience Ltd). Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and 1% Triton X-100 plus a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 30 min. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cell lysates (10 μg of protein) and equivalent volumes of medium samples were resolved on Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) for Western blot analysis with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-BACE1 monoclonal antibody 9B21, anti-APP antibody Ab54, sAPPα antibody 6E10, or sAPPβ antibody G26. Monoclonal antibody 9B21 was raised to the catalytic domain of BACE1 using the BACE1-Fc fusion protein as an immunogen. Endoglycosidase H and N-glycosidase F treatment of media was carried out at 37 °C for 16 h as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Ectodomain Shedding of BACE1 from HEK 293 Cells—To determine whether the extracellular domain of BACE1 is cleaved and released from cells, we generated HEK 293 cells stably expressing BACE1 with a C-terminal MycHis6 tag (BACE1-MycHis6). Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with an anti-Myc antibody confirmed BACE1 expression in these cells (Fig. 1a). Subsequent analysis of the medium with antibody 9B21, which recognizes the catalytic domain of BACE1, allowed detection of soluble shed BACE1. Shed BACE1 in the medium was not immunoreactive with anti-Myc antibody (data not shown) and migrated as a band of lower M r than full-length BACE1 in cells, confirming that the extracellular domain of BACE1 is cleaved and released from cells. The appearance of shed BACE1 in the medium should be concomitant with the generation of an intracellular C-terminal fragment (CTF). Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with anti-Myc antibody failed to detect a BACE1 CTF even upon prolonged exposure, suggesting that it may be rapidly turned over in the cell (data not shown). To eliminate any effect of the MycHis6 tag at the C terminus of BACE1 on its ability to be cleaved and released from cells, medium from HEK 293 cells expressing untagged BACE1 (Fig. 1b) was also subjected to Western blot analysis with antibody 9B21. Shed BACE1 was detected in the medium from these cells, indicating that the C-terminal tags do not influence BACE1 cleavage and release from cells. In addition, both the tagged and non-tagged forms of the protein expressed in cells gave the same overall pattern of mature and immature forms (Fig. 1), indicating that the tag had no effect on the trafficking and processing of the proteins in the endomembrane system. To determine which form of BACE1 is shed from cells, deglycosylation experiments were carried out. Shed BACE1 in the medium is resistant to endoglycosidase H treatment (Fig. 1c), whereas treatment with N-glycosidase F causes a shift in M r, indicating that it is the mature form of BACE1 in cells that is subject to cleavage. As BACE1 is a proteinase, we went on to investigate whether BACE1 could mediate its own ectodomain shedding. HEK 293 cells were transfected with either wild type BACE1-MycHis6 or mutants in which the aspartic acid residues in the active site had been mutated to asparagine (D93N and D289N), which, as we have shown previously, abolish the catalytic activity of the proteinase (21Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S. Murphy K.E. Southan C.D. Ryan D.M. Smith T.S. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 14: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Both wild type and mutant BACE1 were expressed in cells to similar levels (Fig. 1d, top panel). Analysis of the medium from these cells revealed a similar level of soluble shed BACE1 from both wild type and mutant protein (Fig. 1d, bottom panel), indicating that BACE1 does not mediate it own cleavage and release from cells. Characteristics of BACE1 Shedding—The ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins can be up-regulated by agents that activate protein kinase C (32Yoshida K. Asaoka Y. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6443-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ectodomain shedding of BACE1 is controlled by a similar mechanism, HEK 293 cells expressing BACE1-MycHis6 were grown in the absence or presence of the phorbol ester PMA, which is known to activate protein kinase C. Treatment of cells with PMA led to an increase of ∼2.5-fold in the level of shed BACE1 in the medium (Fig. 2a, bottom panel) indicating that activation of protein kinase C increases BACE1 shedding. Hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitors have been reported to inhibit the shedding of other cell surface proteins (1Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimotot T.K. Rose-John S. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 5Parvathy S. Hussain I. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Amit T. Hochberg Z. Yogev-Falach M. Youdim M.B.H. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We went on to determine whether the ectodomain shedding of BACE1 is sensitive to inhibitors of this class by exposing HEK 293 cells expressing BACE1-MycHis6 to two hydroxamate inhibitors, SB-202968 or SB-242113 (Fig. 2b). The presence of either SB-202968 or SB-242113 reduced the release of soluble BACE1 in the medium to <20% of the level seen in untreated cells, clearly indicating the involvement of a metalloproteinase in the ectodomain shedding of BACE1. Taken together, this set of results indicates that BACE1 shedding shows all the characteristics of ectodomain shedding reported previously for other proteins, namely up-regulation by phorbol esters and cleavage by a metalloproteinase. Inhibition of BACE1 Shedding Does Not Regulate APP Processing at the β-Site, and BACE1 Sheddase Is Distinct from α-Secretase—The phorbol ester and hydroxamate inhibitors described so far are non-selective and are known to affect the ectodomain shedding of other cell surface proteins, including α-secretase cleavage of APP (5Parvathy S. Hussain I. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of BACE1 shedding could influence APP processing at the β-site (for example, by reducing the amount of BACE1 reinternalized to the endosomes, which is a major site of APP processing), we needed to identify fully selective BACE1 sheddase inhibitors, which had no effect on α-secretase processing of APP. Therefore, a range of hydroxamate-based inhibitors were screened for their effects on BACE1 shedding and APP processing by α-secretase. A number of hydroxamate inhibitors were found to inhibit ectodomain shedding of BACE1 from HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3a). To determine whether these compounds affected APP processing, HEK 293 cells expressing BACE1-MycHis6 cells were transiently transfected with APP695 followed by treatment with the inhibitors. None of the hydroxamate inhibitors had any effect on the processing of APP by α-secretase, as similar levels of sAPPα and intracellular CTFα were detected in the control and treated cells (Fig. 3b). This different inhibition profile for the BACE1 sheddase and α-secretase suggests that the BACE1 sheddase is distinct from α-secretase. This was further confirmed by the identification of a hydroxamate inhibitor, SB-451916. which had no effect on BACE1 shedding (Fig. 3c) but significantly reduced the level of sAPPα (Fig. 3d). The selective BACE1 sheddase inhibitors were subsequently used to determine whether inhibition of BACE1 shedding affects β-secretase cleavage of APP in these cells. None of the hydroxamate inhibitors had any effect on secreted sAPPβ levels or intracellular CTFβ levels, indicating that the inhibition of BACE1 shedding has no effect on APP processing at the β-site (Fig. 3b). In addition, the inhibitors had no effect on the level of Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides secreted into the medium from these cells (data not shown). ADAM10-selective Hydroxamate Inhibitor Blocks Ectodomain Shedding of BACE1—Members of the ADAM family of metalloproteases are known to mediate the ectodomain shedding of a variety of cell surface proteins (34Moss M.L. Lambert M.H. Essays Biochem. 2002; 38: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To establish the identity of the BACE1 sheddase, the potency and selectivity of two hydroxamate inhibitors to ADAM10 and TACE in vitro were exploited (33Hundhausen C. Misztela D. Berkhout T.A. Broadway N. Saftig P. Reiss K. Hartmann D. Fahrenholz F. Postina R. Matthews V. Kallen K.J. Rose-John S. Ludwig A. Blood. April 24, 2003; (DOI. 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3775)PubMed Google Scholar). GW4023 is a highly potent and selective ADAM10 inhibitor (IC50, 5 nm) being 100-fold less potent against TACE (IC50, 541 nm). In contrast, GW0264 shows similar potency for ADAM10 (IC50, 11 nm) and TACE (IC50, 8 nm) (Fig. 4a) Treatment of HEK-BACE1 cells with the indicated concentrations of either inhibitor caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the release of shed BACE1 (Fig. 4b). Densitometric analysis of these blots allowed concentration response curves and EC50 values for inhibition of BACE1 shedding to be generated (Fig. 4c). Both compounds inhibited the generation of shed BACE1 with potencies similar to those described for these inhibitors against ADAM10 in vitro. As GW4023 abolished BACE1 shedding at concentrations far below the reported IC50 for this compound against TACE, it is unlikely that TACE mediates the ectodomain shedding of BACE1. Rather, our data show ADAM10 to be a potential candidate for the BACE1 sheddase. The extracellular domains of many diverse cell surface proteins are cleaved and released from cells by a process known as ectodomain shedding. Here we have shown that the ectodomain of BACE1 undergoes a similar cleavage, resulting in the release of soluble shed protein from cells. As reported for other shed proteins, ectodomain shedding of BACE1 is stimulated by agents that activate protein kinase C and is inhibited by hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitors, suggesting a common processing mechanism. Hence, BACE1 belongs to that group of transmembrane proteins that is subjected to regulated ectodomain shedding and includes APP, TNFα, and l-selectin. Using potent and selective ADAM10 inhibitors, we demonstrate that ADAM10, but not TACE, is a strong candidate for the BACE1 sheddase in HEK cells. However, we can not rule out the possibility that other metalloproteinases that may be sensitive to the hydroxamate inhibitors described in this study could also contribute to the BACE1 sheddase activity in these cells. In addition, by testing a range of hydroxamate inhibitors we show that the BACE1 sheddase is distinct from α-secretase. Several members of the ADAM family of metalloproteinases (ADAM10, ADAM9, and TACE) have been proposed as candidates for α-secretase (16Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.-N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L.

A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ADAM10 in cells increases basal and PKC-inducible α-secretase cleavage of APP, whereas a catalytically inactive form of ADAM10 acts as a dominant negative, precluding the generation of sAPPα (19Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). However, α-secretase activity is preserved in fibroblasts from ADAM10-deficient mice (35Hartmann D. De Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lübke T. Illert A.L. Von Figura K. Saftig P. Human Molecular Genetics. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of TACE and ADAM9 also results in increased PKC-inducible α-secretase cleavage of APP (17Slack B.E. Ma L.K. Seah C.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Hotoda N Koike H. Sasagawa N. Ishiura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, fibroblasts derived from TACE-deficient mice exhibit reduced PKC inducible α-secretase activity (16Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.-N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L. Peschon J.J. Johnson R.S. Castner B.J. Cerretti D.P. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27765-27767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). All of these findings suggest that multiple ADAMs contribute to α-secretase activity in different tissues. Our findings suggest that ADAM10 is not the major α-secretase in HEK cells but may constitute the BACE1 sheddase activity in these cells. Future studies will allow the role of ADAM10 in the ectodomain shedding of BACE1 to be further elucidated. A key question to address was whether regulation of BACE1 shedding could influence APP processing at the β-site, as this may have therapeutic implications. APP is known to transit along the secretory pathway to the cell surface where it can be processed by α-secretase (36Sisodia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). APP at the cell surface is reinternalized and targeted to the endosomes where β-secretase cleavage of APP occurs (37Haass C. Koo E. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The trafficking of BACE1 in cells follows a similar route, with the protein residing at the cell surface and undergoing re-internalization to endocytic compartments (31Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Inhibition of BACE1 shedding could lead to the accumulation of increased levels of full-length BACE1 at the cell surface that could then be re-internalized, perhaps in conjunction with APP, and targeted to endosomes. In contrast, stimulation of BACE1 shedding would have the opposite effect and reduce the level of full-length BACE1 that is in cells and available for re-internalization and, therefore, decrease APP processing at the β-site. The possibility that the ectodomain shedding of BACE1 may enhance the amyloidogenic potential of this proteinase was proposed in a previous study that employed a secreted form of the protein (30Benjannet S. Elagoz A. Wickham L. Mamarbachi M. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Lazure C. Cromlish J.A. Sisodia S. Checler F. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10879-10887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Expression of a soluble form of BACE1 in cells that resembled the shed protein led to a marked increase in Aβ40 levels but, interestingly, a reduction in CTFβ levels. However, it is possible that the increase in the Aβ40 level reported in this study was merely a reflection of the faster rate of transit in cells of soluble BACE1 as compared with that of the full-length protein rather than an indication that shed BACE1 is more amyloidogenic. To address this point in a more physiological manner, we exploited the availability of selective and potent inhibitors of the BACE1 sheddase and clearly established that none of these compounds have any significant effect on β-secretase cleavage of APP. However, subtle changes in β-secretase activity due to inhibition of BACE1 shedding cannot be ruled out. In conclusion, we have shown that BACE1, a key therapeutic target for treatment of AD, is subject to ectodomain shedding. Although the physiological significance of shed BACE1 is unclear at present, it appears to have no major functional implications for APP processing, and, therefore, inhibition of BACE1 shedding is unlikely to have therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's Disease.

To gain further insight into the coenzyme A biosynthesis in plants, we identified the four missing A. thaliana coenzyme A biosynthetic genes via comparative genomics using the BLAST program (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69138) Google Scholar) and the known sequences/conserved sequence motifs of prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes. According to the prokaryotic nomenclature, the biosynthetic genes of A. thaliana encoding the pantothenate kinase, the 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase, the 4′-phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase, and the dephosphocoenzyme A kinase were named AtCoaA, AtCoaB, AtCoaD, and AtCoaE, respectively. The AtCoa genes were reverse transcriptase PCR amplified, and the cDNAs were cloned into bacterial expression vectors and over-expressed. The expressed recombinant proteins were purified, their activity was determined, and the entire plant coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway, starting with pantothenate, was reconstituted in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of AtCoa GenesMaterials—The materials used for cloning were obtained from New England Biolabs (pMAL-c2X vector and Escherichia coli TB1 host for expression), Roche Applied Science (First Strand cDNA synthesis kit for reverse transcriptase PCR (avian myeloblastis virus)), Sigma (GenElute mammalian total RNA kit and REDTaq DNA polymerase), Sigma-Genosys (oligonucleotides), and Stratagene (pBluescript SK+ vector). The pSBETa helper vector was constructed at the Max-Planck Institut, Köln, Germany (24Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbiss H.-H. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 196-200PubMed Google Scholar).Plant Material—A. thaliana ecotype Columbia was grown in the greenhouse at 25 °C for 8 h in the dark and 16 h in light.Genome Analysis—Comparative genomics was performed using programs such as BLAST (23Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69138) Google Scholar) and data bank resources from the NCBI. Protein domain families were generated with the ProDom program from the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL sequence databases (25Corpet F. Servant F. Gouzy J. Kahn D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The Wisconsin Package software, Version 10.0-UNIX, from Genetics Computer Group (GCG; Madison, WI) was used for Pileup and Prettybox sequence alignments with gcg10.cDNA Cloning—Using peptide sequence motifs shared between prokaryotic and eukaryotic CoA biosynthetic enzymes (i.e. the Walker kinase motif of E. coli CoaE; Refs. 26Traut T.W.

The corresponding homologous genes were cloned by reverse transcriptase PCR using leaf total RNA as template for the first strand cDNA synthesis together with an oligo(dT) primer and avian myeloblastis virus reverse transcriptase. The first strand cDNA template was PCR amplified using REDTaq DNA polymerase and the 5′-forward and 3′-reverse gene-specific adapted primers 5′-CGAGGAATTCATGGATCCGACTCAAATCTCTC-3′/5′-CCGGCTCGAGCTAAACTAAATTGATGCTACATTC-3′; 5′-CCGGGGATCCATGAGTTCGATCTCTGGATTGGTGGAAG-3′/5′-CCGGCTCGAGTCAAGTGAGAGATTCTTTGATGTATG-3′; 5′-CCGGGGATCCATGGCAGCTCCGGAAGATTCAAAGATG-3′/5-CGAGAAGC TTCCACCTCATGATGCTTTTTCTTCTGCTGGTTG-3′; and 5′-CCGGGGATCCATGAGAATAGTCGGGTTAACGGG-3′/5′-CGAGAAGCTTCCACCTTAAGAGCCAATTTTGAGCTGTTTGC-3′ for AtCoaA, AtCoaB, AtCoaD, and AtCoaE, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into the pBluescript SK+ vector, and then the full-length cDNAs, containing the entire gene coding regions, were subcloned into the pMAL-c2X expression vector (EcoRI/SalI in the case of AtCoaA, BamHI/SalI in the case of AtCoaB, and BamHI/HindIII for AtCoaD and AtCoaE) and transformed into the expression strain E. coli TB1 for recombinant protein production. Depending on which cloning site of the pMAL-c2X polylinker (located downstream of the malE gene) is used, different vector-encoded residues are fused between the factor Xa cleavage site and the NH2-terminal methionine residue of the cloned AtCoa protein (Ile-Ser-Glu-Phe in the case of AtCoaA and Ile-Ser-Glu-Phe-Gly-Ser for AtCoaB, AtCoaD, and AtCoaE). Sequencing of the pMAL-c2X clones revealed that the sequence of AtCoaA is the same as that published in the GenBank™. However there are three point mutations within the AtCoaD protein (A37V, I68V, and V87I) and two within the AtCoaE protein (Q186R and F204I) compared with the GenBank™ entries. The PPC synthetase activity of AtCoaB was investigated using two different malE-AtCoaB clones; in one case, the AtCoaB sequence was the same as that published in the GenBank™, and in the other case there were five mutations (deletion of Gly45-Met46 and the point mutations D10A, M137T, R150H, and L268S). In this paper we do not differentiate between the two variants, and the term MBP-AtCoaB is used for both fusion proteins because both were active in synthesizing 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine. Clone AtCoaA (Ins) resulted from a nucleotide insertion in AtCoaA, giving a 36-amino acid-long inserted peptide at position 70 that replaced 15 amino acids from position 70 to position 84 of the corresponding translated protein. To improve the expression of the eukaryotic genes AtCoaB and AtCoaD, respectively, in the E. coli system, E. coli TB1 cells were co-transformed with pMal-C2XAtCoaB/AtCoaD and the helper plasmid pSBETa. The positive co-transformed colonies were selected on 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml kanamycin.Purification of ProteinsGrowth of Strains—The E. coli strains used were grown to A 578 = 0.4 in 0.5 liters of B-broth (10 g of casein hydrolysate 140; Invitrogen), 5 g of yeast extract (Difco), 5 g of NaCl, 1 g of glucose, and 1 g of K2HPO4 per liter, pH 7.3) in 2-liter shaker flasks, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and harvested 2 h after induction. E. coli TB1 (pMal-c2X AtCoaA/AtCoaE) cells were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml ampicillin, E. coli TB1 (pMal-c2X AtCoaB/AtCoaD, pSBETa) cells were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml kanamycin, E. coli BL21 (DE3) pET28a(+) AtHAL3a cells were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and E. coli M15 (pQE8 coaA/coaB, pREP4) cells were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. Growth temperature was 37 °C.MBP Fusion Proteins—For purification of the MBP-AtCoaA/B/D/E fusion proteins, IPTG-induced cells were harvested, the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer, and the cells were disrupted by sonication. A cleared lysate obtained by two centrifugation steps (each for 20 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C) was adjusted to 250 mm NaCl and then applied to amylose resin equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 250 mm NaCl). The resin was then washed with 7 volumes of column buffer. Amylose-bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose in column buffer.Purification of His-AtHAL3a Proteins—500 ml of IPTG-induced E. coli BL21 (DE3) pET28a(+) AtHAL3a cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). 2.5 ml of the cleared lysate obtained by two centrifugation steps (each for 20 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C) was diluted with a 2.5-ml column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl) and applied to an equilibrated Ni-NTA column containing ∼0.5 ml of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen). The column was then washed with a 10-ml column buffer. His-AtHAL3a was eluted with a column buffer containing 250 instead of 10 mm imidazole.Purification of E. coli His-CoaA and His-CoaB Proteins—For purification of E. coli His-CoaA and His-CoaB proteins, 500 ml of IPTG-induced E. coli M15 (pREP4, pQE8 coaA/coaB) cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). 1.3–2.6 ml of the cleared lysates obtained by two centrifugation steps (each for 20 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C) were applied to Ni-NTA spin columns (Qiagen) equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm imidazole, and 300 mm NaCl). The spin columns were then washed twice with 0.65 ml of column buffer. His-CoaA and His-CoaB proteins were eluted with 0.16–0.6 ml of column buffer containing 250 instead of 10 mm imidazole. The Ni-NTA spin columns were centrifuged at room temperature at only 240 × g to enable effective binding of the His tag proteins.SDS-PAGE—Proteins were separated using tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (28Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). Prestained molecular weight standards were obtained from New England Biolabs.Activity AssaysPPC Synthetase Assay—Because 4′-phosphopantothenate is not commercially available, it was synthesized enzymatically by adding E. coli His-CoaA, pantothenate, and ATP to the PPC synthetase assay mixtures (29Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36137-36145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, 1-ml assay mixtures contained 5 mm pantothenate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5–10 mm ATP (and, in addition, 5 mm CTP for E. coli His-CoaB), 5 mm cysteine hydrochloride, 10 mm DTT, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), His-CoaA (∼15 to 25 μg), and either wild type E. coli His-CoaB or MBP-AtCoaB proteins in the range of 5–30 μg. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were kept at –80 °C and then were successively separated by reversed phase chromatography (RPC) with a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column on a SMART system (Pharmacia). Compounds were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 5.8 ml with a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The absorbance was measured simultaneously at 214, 260, and 280 nm to enable identification of acyl-cytidylate and acyl-adenylate intermediates, respectively (29Kupke T. J. Biol.

The reaction mixtures were then kept at –80 °C and separated by reversed phase chromatography as described above. As standard substances, synthetic dephospho-coenzyme A (Sigma) and coenzyme A (Fluka) were used.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIsolation of A. thaliana CoA Biosynthetic Genes—The complete sequence of the Arabidopsis genome (22The Arabidopsis Genome InitiativeNature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7056) Google Scholar) has been used for identification of the four remaining uncharacterized genes of the A. thaliana CoA biosynthetic pathway. With the known bacterial and human coenzyme A biosynthetic genes/proteins and using the program BLAST and the ProDom tool, five putative monofunctional A. thaliana CoA biosynthetic genes, named AtCoaA, AtCoaB, AtCoaB*, AtCoaD, and AtCoaE were identified in the comparative genomic approach. Together with the flavoprotein AtHAL3a (AtCoaC1) (gi 5802225), which was recently characterized as 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (17Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S.

Williams R.S. Ramaswamy G. Rock C.O. Campbell E. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

The A. thaliana AtCoaA protein (383 amino acids) shows only poor homology to the pantothenate kinase (gi 145561) from Escherichia coli (10Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6411-6417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is strong homology to pantothenate kinases from lower and higher eukaryotes, namely the putative pantothenate kinase (gi 6320740) encoded on chromosome IV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Homo sapiens pantothenate kinase 1 isoform β (gi 23510402) on chromosome 10 (31Ni X. Ma Y. Cheng H. Jiang M. Ying K. Xie Y. Mao Y. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). AtCoaA (gi 30696417) also has homology to the aminoterminal domain of a further putative A. thaliana protein encoded on chromosome 4 (gi 7270122) and to the amino-terminal domain of pantothenate kinase 2 from H. sapiens (gi 20043247). The latter is encoded by the panK2 gene on chromosome 1, which is defective in Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome (32Zhou B. Westaway S.K. Levinson B. Johnson M.A. Gitschier J. Hayflick S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The AtCoaA gene shows also low homology to further hypothetical bacterial representatives (for example Bacillus cereus, gi 29896568, and Bacillus anthracis, gi 21400792).Fig. 2AtCoaA alignment with homologous proteins. The predicted amino acid sequence of A. thaliana AtCoaA was compared with homologous representatives from H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae.

There are two significant differences between the GenBank™ entries for AtCoaB and AtCoaB*. In AtCoaB, a 24-amino acid amino-terminal extension (Met1 to Asn24) and an insertion of 22 amino acid residues (Val127 to Glu148) are present that are missing in AtCoaB*. AtCoaB and AtCoaB* both share a strong similarity, not only with the above mentioned human ortholog but also with an uncharacterized protein from yeast (gi 577131 of chromosome IX). Both the human (12Daugherty M. Polanuyer B. Farrell M. Scholle M. Lykidis A. De Crécy-Lagard V. Osterman A. J. Biol.

Later, it was shown that AtHAL3a shares the PPC decarboxylase signature sequence with bacterial enzymes (15Kupke T. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate of the decarboxylation reaction was purified (16Hernández-Acosta P. Schmid D.G. Jung G. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. Kupke T. J. Biol.

For example, the conserved Asn residue, which is involved in binding the carboxylate group of PPC, or the conserved cysteine residue of the substrate binding clamp, which is involved in reduction of the oxidatively decarboxylated intermediate, are not present in SIS2 (15Kupke T.

In a foot-and-mouth disease virus capsid, 42 amino acid side chains per protomer are involved in noncovalent interactions between pentameric subunits that function as assembly/disassembly intermediates. We have individually truncated to alanine these 42 side chains and assessed their relevance for completion of the virus life cycle and capsid stability. Most mutations provoked a drastic reduction in virus yields. Nearly all of these critical mutations led to virions whose thermal inactivation rates differed from that of the parent virus, and many affected also early steps in the viral cycle. Rapid selection of genotypic revertants or variants with forward or compensatory mutations that restored viability was occasionally detected. The results with this model virus indicate the following. (i) Most of the residues at the interfaces between capsid subunits are critically important for viral function, in part but not exclusively because of their involvement in intersubunit recognition. Each hydrogen bond and salt bridge buried at the subunit interfaces may be important for capsid stability. (ii) New mutations able to restore viability may arise frequently at the subunit interfaces during virus evolution.

Assembly and stability of the multimeric proteins that constitute icosahedral virus capsids depend on the occurrence of multiple non-covalent interactions between many polypeptide subunits (1Liljas L.

Compared with small oligomeric proteins, the adaptive structural solutions for subunit recognition and stability may be uniquely limited in virus capsids. For example, the many repetitive intersubunit interactions must be strong enough to provide stability against dissociation by extracellular agents, although not so strong as to impair the mechanism of intracellular uncoating. Viral capsids thus provide good models for understanding protein-protein recognition evolved under stringent, even conflicting, selective constraints (3Johnson J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, to our knowledge no systematic mutagenesis approach to experimentally dissect the contribution of each residue in the subunit interfaces to the stability or functionality of a virus capsid or any other large protein assembly had been attempted to date.

Moreover, FMDV causes the economically most important disease of farm animals (32Sobrino F. Saiz M. Jiménez-Clavero M.A. Núñez J.I. Rosas M.F. Baranowski E. Ley V. Vet. Res. 2001; 32: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The recent epizootics in the United Kingdom, with estimated losses that could exceed £10 billion in that country alone (33Samuel A.R. Knowles N.J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 421-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), have provided a stark remainder within the European Union of the devastating economic and social damage FMDV may cause worldwide. One important problem of the current FMD vaccines, based on chemically inactivated virions, is their very low stability. Vaccines based on particles with improved thermostability would be highly desirable in the prevention of FMD and other viral diseases. Assembly of the picornaviral capsid proceeds in several steps (34Rueckert R.R. Fields B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar). The capsid proteins VP0 (1AB), VP3 (1C), and VP1 (1D) are translated as a polyprotein precursor (P1), may fold co-translationally (2Rossmann M.G. Johnson J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 533-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and are proteolytically processed to yield the mature protomer. Five protomers are assembled to form a pentameric intermediate, and finally, 12 pentamers are assembled to form the icosahedral capsid (Fig. 1). After encapsidation of the RNA genome most VP0 molecules are processed to give VP4 (1A, the N terminus of VP0) and VP2 (1B). Disassembly of the FMDV virion in vivo begins with its dissociation into pentamers (35Vasquez C. Denoya C.D. La Torre J.L. Palma E. Virology. 1979; 97: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) by acidification in the endosomes (36Carrillo E.C. Giachetti C. Campos R.H. Virology. 1984; 135: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mild heating of FMDV virions also leads to irreversible dissociation into stable pentamers (34Rueckert R.R. Fields B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar), an event that appears as the main cause for the need of a cold chain to preserve FMD vaccines.

Drew J. Blakemore W.E. Stuart D.I. King A.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the present study, the functional importance of each amino acid side chain involved in noncovalent interactions between subunits in a virus protein shell has been tested by alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the FMDV capsid. The results reveal severe intolerance to variation due to the involvement of many interfacial residues in capsid stability and in other steps of the virus life cycle, and identify those tolerant residues that could be replaced for the rational engineering of a thermostable capsid. Viruses and Plasmids—FMDV C-S8c1 is a plaque-purified derivative of serotype C isolate C1SantaPau-Sp70 (42Sobrino F. Dávila M. Ortín J. Domingo E. Virology. 1983; 128: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Plasmids pO1K/C-S8c1, pO1K/Δ3242, and p3242/C-S8c1 have been described (43Baranowski E. Sevilla N. Verdaguer N. Ruiz-Jarabo C. Beck E. Domingo E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6362-6372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Use of a cDNA clone entirely derived from a type C virus had been hampered by its low infectivity. Instead, pO1K/C-S8c1 was derived from an infectious cDNA clone obtained by Beck and co-workers (44Zibert A. Maass G. Strebel K. Falk M.M. Beck E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2467-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from FMDV O1 Kaufbeuren. pO1K/C-S8c1 contains a cDNA copy of an infectious chimeric FMDV genome coding for the capsid proteins and protease 2A of C-S8c1, a chimeric 2B protein and all of the nonstructural proteins (2A and 2B excepted) of O1Kaufbeuren. Plasmid pO1K/Δ3242 corresponds to pO1K/C-S8c1 with a segment of 3242 bp (between the two NgoMIV restriction sites) deleted. This segment includes the entire region coding for the capsid proteins of FMDV C-S8c1. Plasmid p3242/C-S8c1 contains this same 3242-bp segment inserted in a vector derived from plasmid pGEM-5Zf(+) (43Baranowski E. Sevilla N. Verdaguer N. Ruiz-Jarabo C. Beck E. Domingo E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6362-6372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis, Subcloning, and DNA Sequencing—Site-directed mutagenesis of FMDV capsid residues was carried out on plasmid p3242/C-S8c1 by the inverse PCR method using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) and pairs of 25- to 36-mer oligonucleotides. The mutations were checked by dideoxynucleotide-based automated sequencing. No second site mutations were found. The mutagenized 3242-bp NgoMIV segments were subcloned in pO1K/Δ3242 to obtain pO1K/C-S8c1 plasmids including the chosen mutations. As a control, a non-mutated 3242-bp NgoMIV segment derived from the original p3242/C-S8c1 plasmid was subjected to the same steps. The entire subcloned 3242-bp segment of a subset of the pO1K/C-S8c1 mutant plasmids, of non-mutated pO1K/C-S8c1, and of a revertant plasmid (obtained by back-mutating Ala-3146 to the original residue) was sequenced. Again no second site mutations were found. Transcription of Viral RNA and Electroporation of Eukaryotic Cells—pO1K/C-S8c1 and the mutant plasmids were linearized by digestion with HpaI, purified, and dissolved in RNase-free water. Infectious FMDV RNA was transcribed from the linearized plasmids by using the Riboprobe in vitro transcription system (Promega). The mixture contained 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl RNasin, 2.5 mm each of ribonucleoside triphosphates, 25 ng/μl linearized plasmid DNA, and 0.5 unit/μl SP6 RNA polymerase and was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The RNA concentration was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. About 2–4 × 106 BHK-21 cells from 60 to 80% confluent monolayers were resuspended in 0.5 ml of electroporation buffer containing 21 mm Hepes, pH 7.05, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm glucose, and transferred to a Gene Pulser Cuvette (Bio-Rad) with a 0.4-cm electrode gap. FMDV RNA (3 μg) was added and electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser set at 280 V, 250 microfarads, 400 ohm (two pulses). The cells were plated in a P60 Petri dish containing 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37 °C. At 4 h post-transfection the medium was discarded, and 2 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 2% fetal calf serum was added. The incubation was continued for up to 90 h, with aliquots removed at specified intervals. The progeny virus suspension was clarified by centrifugation, and aliquots were stored at –70 °C. For nearly every transfection experiment, RNA was used immediately after transcription. Use of the same RNA either freshly prepared or frozen and thawed yielded very similar results. The same amount of RNA was used for every mutant. In each experiment the same amount of parent FMDV RNA, and no RNA, was used as a control. Immunofluorescence Assays—BHK-21 cells were electroporated with viral RNA as described above and subsequently cultured on coverslips. These were washed, incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed again, and incubated with 10 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.5. The cell membranes were permeabilized by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The coverslips were washed again, incubated in PBS + 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5C4 (45Mateu M.G. Hernández J. Martínez M.A. Feigelstock D. Lea S. Pérez J.J. Giralt D. Stuart D. Palma E.L. Domingo E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (ascitic fluid diluted 1:500 in PBS + 3% BSA), washed thoroughly, incubated with secondary antibody (Alexa-488 from Molecular Probes, diluted 1:500 in PBS + 3% BSA), washed, mounted, and visualized in a fluorescence microscope. Titration and Amplification of Viruses and Extraction of Viral RNA—Virus titers were determined in plaque assays. Mutant virions obtained at very low titers were amplified by a single passage in BHK-21 cell monolayers at the highest possible multiplicity of infection. The progeny virus suspension was collected immediately after the cytopathic effect was observed, clarified, aliquoted, and frozen at –70 °C. RNA derived from virions collected from the supernatants of transfected or infected cell cultures was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and precipitated with ethanol. The RNA was reverse-transcribed to DNA and amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR as described previously (46Ruiz-Jarabo C.M. Arias A. Baranowski E. Escarmís C. Domingo E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3543-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the relevant segments were sequenced. Radioactive Labeling and Purification of Virions—FMDV virions were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (Redivue Pro-mix, Amersham Biosciences) and purified by sedimentation through a sucrose cushion followed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, essentially as described (47Díez J. Dávila M. Escarmís C. Mateu M.G. Domínguez J.J. Pérez E. Giralt E. Melero J.A. Domingo E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5519-5528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fractions containing full virions (sedimentation coefficient 140 S) were extensively dialyzed against PBS and clarified by centrifugation. The purified virions were free of contaminants, as judged by overloaded SDS-urea-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Capsid Dissociation Assays and Measurement of Rate Constants— Aliquots (0.3 ml) of 35S-labeled, purified virus were incubated at a constant temperature for different amounts of time, transferred to ice, loaded in 10–30% sucrose density gradients, and centrifuged at 4 °C in an SW40 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 18,000 rpm for 18 h. The gradients were fractionated in 0.5-ml aliquots, and the radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. In a second type of assay, virus suspensions obtained by transfection of infectious mutant RNA were diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 2% fetal calf serum to a concentration of about 1000 plaque-forming units/ml. 100-μl aliquots in thin walled PCR tubes were incubated at a given temperature (42 °C unless indicated otherwise) for different amounts of time, and the remaining virus titers were determined in plaque assays. Non-mutated C-S8c1 virus obtained in parallel transfection experiments was used in each heat-inactivation experiment as a positive control. The experimental data were fitted to a first-order exponential decay by using the program Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software) and Equation 1, C=C0exp(-kt)(Eq. 1) where C is the virus titer at time t; C 0 is the virus titer at t = 0; and k is the dissociation rate constant.

Within the cut-off distances imposed (Table I), a total of 61 residues per capsid protomer appear involved in direct interpentamer interactions. The side chains of 42 of those residues are involved, beyond Cβ, in such interactions and constitute the interpentamer interface accessible to mutation (Table I and Fig. 1B). Eighteen of these side chains (only 8 being nonpolar) participate exclusively in van der Waals interactions, with an average of 2.8 contacts per residue. Very few (0–2) of these are carbon-carbon contacts (the only exceptions being residues Tyr-2200, Gln-3071, and Thr-2022 with 11, 5, and 3 carbon-carbon contacts, respectively). The remaining 24 polar side chains per protomer at the interfaces are involved in many interpentamer polar interactions. These include, per protomer subunit, a total of 18 different side chain-main chain or side chain-side chain hydrogen bonds, 2 strict salt bridges, 6 medium range charge-charge interactions, and a short range charge-helix dipole interaction (Table I). Most of these 24 side chains participate also in a variable but generally small numbers of van der Waals contacts.Table ISide chains involved in non-covalent interactions between pentamer subunits in the FMDV C-S8c1 capsidResidueaFor each residue, the first digit indicates the protein (either VP2 or VP3) and the last three digits the amino acid position according to Ref. 38.Charge-charge interactionsHydrogen bondsvan der Waals contactsE20111(K3118, 3.8 Å)7I20141R20182mc(N1017,Y1018)4H20211(E2213, 4.1 Å)5T20223T20231S20241sc(R3120)T20261sc(R3120)3Q20273mc(L3151,2xN3152)20L20512T20531sc(Q2057)Q20571sc(T2053)1R20601(E2213)1sc(E2213), 2mc (H3141,C3142)3K20631(E3146)2sc(E3146,H3144)12K20881(CtE2218, 5.5 Å)2K20961(CtE2218, 5.8 Å)Y20981E21081(R3120, 4.8 Å)T21101sc(R3120)1V21122N21144Q21154F21161M21543K21981(D3069, 4.8 Å)Y220012N22021E22132(R2060, H2021, 4.1 Å)1sc(R2060)5D30691(K2198)Q30717K31181(E2011, 3.8 Å)1mc(Q2115)7R31201(E2108, 4.8 Å)1mc(T2025), 3sc (S2024,T2026,T2110)3M31222H31411(helix dipole)6H31441sc(K2063)9E31461(K2063)1sc(K2063)4D31481mc(Q2027)7L31511N31521I31891T31905K31931mc(A2192)8a For each residue, the first digit indicates the protein (either VP2 or VP3) and the last three digits the amino acid position according to Ref. 38Lea S.

One function of stathmin is to sequester tubulin dimers into assembly incompetent complexes, and recent studies revealed two tubulin binding sites per stathmin molecule.

One of the key properties of MTs is that of “dynamic instability” (1Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Dynamic instability comprises the continuous switching between catastrophes (depolymerization or shrinkage phase) and rescues (polymerization or growing phase) of individual MTs and is central to MT function. In recent years, it has become clear that the balance between MT-stabilizing and -destabilizing factors is responsible for the observed switching between growth and shrinkage of MTs in vivo (2Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). Therefore, obtaining molecular insights into the mechanisms of action of MT regulatory factors is essential to understand how they contribute to the dynamic state of MTs during the cell cycle.The members of the phylogenetically well conserved Op18/stathmin family are phosphorylation-controlled MT-destabilizing proteins (reviewed in Refs. 3Sobel A.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the C-terminal helical domain of the stathmin-like domain (SLD) of the neural isoform RB3 can bind two head-to-tail aligned α/β-tubulin heterodimers. The tubulin subunits in the ternary complex are tilted with respect to each other by ∼25°. The N-terminal part of stathmin was found to cap one α-tubulin monomer to prevent further longitudinal tubulin assembly. Hence, binding of stathmin to tubulin makes these sequestered tubulin subunits efficiently assembly incompetent.However, other in vivo and in vitro studies converged to the hypothesis that stathmin works as a pH-sensitive bifunctional protein: At pH 6.8 stathmin is supposed to act as a sequestering protein, whereas at pH 7.5 it primarily stimulates MT plus-end catastrophes without significantly interacting with tubulin subunits (24Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Holmfeldt P. Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This view is supported by deletion mapping, which indicated that the N terminus of stathmin is required for plus-end catastrophe promotion, whereas the function of the C-terminal helical domain is to bind tubulin dimers (24Howell B. Larsson N. Gullberg M. Cassimeris L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29Segerman B. Holmfeldt P. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well characterized sequestering mechanism, the molecular details of how stathmin interacts with MT ends and triggers catastrophes are not clear.Here we have combined isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the biophysical and structural characteristics of the interaction of stathmin with tubulin. We report that stathmin binds two tubulin subunits with equal affinities under all conditions investigated. The thermodynamic data suggest that the hydrophobic effect represents the major driving force governing the tubulin-stathmin binding reaction. The affinity of stathmin for tubulin as well as the stabilities and conformations of the individual proteins are not significantly affected by small changes in pH. Nevertheless, the small affinity change that was observed between pH 6.8 and 7.5 can be attributed to the weaker binding of the C terminus of stathmin. The results presented are discussed in the context of current functional and structural data on the tubulin-stathmin system.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparations—The cloning of the human full-length stathmin cDNA into the bacterial expression vector pET-16b (Novagen) is outlined in Ref. 13Steinmetz M.O.

Recombinant stathmin was expressed in LB medium using the Escherichia coli host strain JM109(DE3) (Promega), affinity-purified as His6-tagged fusion protein by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on Ni2+-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and separated from the N-terminal His6 tag by proteolytic cleavage with an immobilized snake venom prothrombin activator (for details, see Ref. 13Steinmetz M.O.

After dialysis in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, a RESOURCE Q (Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange chromatography step using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 500 mm was performed.For the preparation of 2H/13C/15N uniformly labeled stathmin, cells were grown in modified new minimal medium (33Budisa N.

Transformed bacteria were stepwise adapted to 99.9% D2O in new minimal medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin prior to expression. A 1-liter cell culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside after growth at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.6. Affinity purification and processing of the recombinant triple-labeled stathmin was the same as for the unlabeled protein. The homogeneities (∼99%), identities, and labeling efficiencies of protein samples were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry.Highly pure bovine brain GTP-tubulin was obtained from Cytoskeleton Inc. GDP-tubulin was prepared by incubating 1 mg/ml GTP-tubulin in G buffer, pH 6.8 (80 mm PIPES-KOH, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 2 mm GDP on ice for 40 min (35Howard W.D. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8292-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).All protein samples were centrifuged at 4 °C and at full speed for 10 min in a tabletop Eppendorf centrifuge prior to the experiments. Concentrations of protein samples were determined by the Advanced Protein Assay (Cytoskeleton Inc.).High Sensitivity ITC—ITC experiments were performed using a VPITC calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). For each experiment, the sample cell (volume 1.4 ml) was filled with a ∼10 μm tubulin solution in G buffer pH 6.8 or 7.5 supplemented with either 1 mm GTP or 2 mm GDP. A 300-μl syringe was filled with a solution of ∼100 μm stathmin (present in the same buffer as tubulin). The reference cell contained buffer only. Typically, 5-μl stathmin aliquots from the stirred syringe (305 rpm) were injected 40 times into the sample cell. At each injection, tubulin was bound to stathmin, leading to a characteristic heat signal. Integration of the individual calorimeter traces yielded the heat of binding, h i, of each injection step. The heats of dilution of stathmin were subtracted from the titration data. During the course of the titration the total tubulin concentration is slightly diluted due to the addition of stathmin. This effect is small but nevertheless was taken into account in the evaluation. The binding isotherms were fitted via a non-linear least squares minimization method to determine the binding stoichiometry, n, the equilibrium binding constant, K 0, and the change in enthalpy, ΔH 0 (see “Results”). For all titrations, the experimental conditions warranted that tubulin remained in the soluble heterodimeric state.Glycerol Spraying/Low-angle Rotary Metal Shadowing and TEM—Protein samples (0.5 mg/ml) in G buffer, pH 6.8, supplemented with 1 mm GTP were incubated for 1 h at room temperature after which glycerol was added to a final concentration of 30%. The samples were immediately sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica and rotary shadowed in a BA 511M freeze-etch apparatus (Balzers) with platinum/carbon at an elevation angle of 3-5° (36Fowler W.E. Aebi U. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1983; 83: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken in a Philips Morgagni TEM operated at 80 kV equipped with a Megaview III charge-coupled device camera. Approximately 400 particles were counted from single micrographs and visually classified into globular and elongated specimens, 8-10 nm and 8-10 × 16-20 nm, respectively.CD Spectroscopy—Protein samples were in 8 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8 or 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm GTP. Far-UV CD spectra and thermal unfolding profiles were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.) equipped with a temperature-controlled quartz cell of 0.1-cm path length. The spectra shown are the averages of five accumulations and were evaluated with the Jasco and Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific) software. A ramping rate of 1 °C·min-1 was used to record the thermal unfolding profiles. The apparent midpoints of the transitions, values of T m, were taken as the maximum of the derivative, d[Θ]222/dT.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out at 23 °C on a Varian UnityPlus spectrometer operating at a 1H frequency of 600 MHz. Samples of 2H/13C/15N-labeled stathmin and unlabeled tubulin were in G buffer at pH 6.8 or 7.5. Both 15N-1H HSQC and 15N-1H TROSY experiments were recorded. However, the TROSY spectra were not superior to the HSQC spectra, probably due to the high proton density in non-deuterated tubulin. The data were analyzed with the VNMR software.RESULTSAnalysis of the Tubulin-Stathmin Binding Equilibrium by ITC—To assess the thermodynamic binding parameters of the tubulin-stathmin binding equilibrium, ITC studies were performed. Fig. 2A shows a typical titration profile in which 12.8 μm GTP-tubulin (referred to as the α/β-tubulin heterodimer with GTP occupying the exchangeable E-site on β-tubulin (2Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar)) is titrated with stathmin. Each titration peak corresponds to the injection of 5-μl aliquots of a 84.0 μm stathmin solution. At 10 °C, the reaction is endothermic, and the reaction heats decrease with increasing injection numbers as less and less free tubulin is available for stathmin binding. The total stathmin concentration in the calorimeter cell varies during the course of the titration and increases from 0.3 μm after the first injection to 10.5 μm after 40 injections. After ∼30 injections, all tubulin is bound to stathmin, and no further heat is produced. Fig. 2B shows the integrated heats of reaction as a function of the stathmin:tubulin molar ratio.Fig. 2ITC analysis of the tubulin-stathmin binding equilibrium. A, raw data obtained for 40 injections, each of 5 μl, of stathmin (84.0 μm) into the sample cell containing 12.8 μm GTP-tubulin. B, integrated heats of reaction (closed circles) with the best fit to the data (line). The fit was calculated with n = 2 by a non-linear least squares minimization to Equation 2 and yielded ΔH GTP-tubulin0 = 15.0 ± 0.14 kcal mol-1 GTP-tubulin and K 0 = 6.0 × 106 ± 0.61 × 106m-1. C, Scatchard plot (Equation 6) of the binding data (closed circles). The straight line is obtained with n = 1.99 and K 0 = 8.2 × 106m-1. The measurement was carried out at 10 °C in 80 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm GTP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The analysis of the binding isotherm is based on a model that assumes n independent and equal binding sites on stathmin for tubulin. If C S0, C T,bound, and C T,free denote the concentration of total stathmin in the calorimeter cell, and the concentration of bound and free tubulin, respectively, then the binding isotherm can be described as (37van Holde K.E. Johnson W.C. Ho S.P. Principles of Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey1998Google Scholar), CT,boundCS0=nK0CT,free1+K0CT,free(Eq. 1) where K 0 is the intrinsic equilibrium binding constant for a single binding site. Equation 1 can be solved for C T,bound via, CT,bound=121K0+CT0+nCS0-121K0+CT0+nCS02-4nCS0CT0(Eq. 2) where C T0 is the total concentration of tubulin in the calorimeter cell. If we denote with h i the measured heat of the ith injection step and by r (k) the fraction of bound tubulin after a total of k injections, then Equation 3 results. r(k)=∑1khi∑1mhi(Eq. 3) The numerator gives the cumulative heat of the first k injections, the denominator is the total heat produced when the supply of the tubulin is exhausted after a total of m injections. The concentrations of bound and free tubulin are then given by Equations 4 and 5. CT,bound(k)=CT0·r(k)(Eq. 4) CT,free(k)=CT0(1-r(k))(Eq. 5) C T,bound and C T,free can thus be determined without any assumptions about the binding mechanism. Because C T,bound is directly accessible via the heats of titration, it is possible to calculate unambiguously the stoichiometry, n, the apparent molar heat of reaction, ΔH 0, and the equilibrium binding constant, K 0, via a non-linear least squares fit to Equation 2 (38Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar, 39Seelig J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The solid line in Fig. 2B calculated with n = 2 represents the best fit to the experimental data and yielded ΔH GTP-tubulin0 = 15.0 ± 0.14 kcal mol-1 GTP-tubulin, and K 0 = 6.0 × 106 ± 0.61 × 106m-1.The classic way of representing biochemical binding data is by using the Scatchard plot, which plots, ν=n-KDνCT,free(Eq. 6) where K D = 1/K 0 denotes the dissociation constant, ν = C T,bound/C S0, and C T,free can be determined according to Equations 3-5. Fig. 2C shows the corresponding plot. A straight line is obtained with n = 1.99 and K 0 = 8.2 × 106m-1, which agrees with the non-linear least squares fit shown in Fig. 2B. All titration experiments performed were also analyzed by Scatchard plots (not shown). It should be noted, however, that the evaluation of the measured h i via a non-linear least squares fit to Equation 2 is more accurate.Next, the GTP-tubulin-stathmin binding reaction was monitored as a function of temperature. Fig. 3 (A and B) illustrates the variation of the reaction enthalpy and the binding constant with temperature. The reaction enthalpy was found to be endothermic at low temperatures and decreased linearly with temperature according to ΔH GTP-tubulin0 (kcal mol-1 GTP-tubulin) = -0.86 T(°C) + 24.0 (Fig. 3A). Extrapolation to higher temperatures predicts ΔH GTP-tubulin0 = 0 Kcal mol-1 at 28 °C and exothermic ΔH GTP-tubulin0 values above this temperature. Hence, below 28 °C the interaction between GTP-tubulin and stathmin is completely entropy-driven, above this temperature both enthalpy and entropy contribute favorably to the binding reaction. The slope of the straight line in Fig. 3A corresponds to the molar heat capacity change of the binding reaction ΔC p0 = -860 cal mol-1 K-1 (referring to tubulin). This is a very large negative change in heat capacity indicative of a hydrophobic reaction. Considering the temperature dependence of the binding reaction, K 0 reaches a maximum value of K 0 = 1.3 × 107m-1 at 28 °C when ΔH GTP-tubulin = 0 kcal mol-1 and decreases again thereafter. The solid line in Fig. 3B is the theoretical prediction of the temperature dependence of K 0 calculated with the van't Hoff equation taking ΔC p0 into account in Equation 7. dlnK0dT=ΔH0+ΔCp0(T-T0)RT2(Eq. 7) The free energy can then be calculated according to ΔG 0 = -RT ln K, and the entropy term is TΔS 0 = ΔH 0 - ΔG 0. The corresponding evaluations are summarized in Table I.Fig. 3Monitoring the tubulin-stathmin binding equilibrium as a function of temperature. A, reaction enthalpies ΔH 0 of GTP-tubulin- (closed circles) and GDP-tubulin-stathmin (opened circles). The reaction enthalpies decrease linearly with temperature according to ΔH GTP-tubulin0 (kcal mol-1 GTP-tubulin) = -0.86 T(°C) + 24.0 and ΔH GTP-tubulin0 (kcal mol-1 GDP-tubulin) = -0.85 T(°C) + 21.2.

https://openalex.org/W1998939489,"DNA damage is a key initiator of neuronal death. We have previously shown that the tumor suppressor p53, in conjunction with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), regulates the mitochondrial pathway of death in neurons exposed to genotoxic agents. However, the mechanisms by which p53 is regulated is unclear. Presently, we show that p53 is phosphorylated on Ser-15 following DNA damage and this occurs independently of the CDK pathway. Instead, we show that p53 phosphorylation, stability, as well as neuronal death is regulated, in part, by the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) protein. Previous reports have suggested that ATM regulation of p53 occurs through Chk2. However, in our present paradigms, we show that ATM functions separately from Chk2 to regulate p53 stability and neuronal death. Chk2 deficiency does not affect p53 stability or neuronal death induced by Topoisomerase I or II inhibition. Taken together, our results provide a model by which DNA damage can activate an ATM-dependent, Chk2-independent pathway of p53-mediated neuronal death.

DNA damage is an important initiator of neuronal death and has been implicated in a wide variety of neuropathological conditions such as stroke (1Dirnagl U. Iadecola C.

However, the mechanisms by which DNA damage induces neuronal death are not fully characterized. p53 is a critical regulator of DNA integrity and coordinates cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis in proliferating cells. This genome surveillance function of p53 is also critical in neurons (10Crumrine R.C. Thomas A.L. Morgan P.F. J. Cereb.

In this regard, p53 is activated and required for neuronal injury induced by DNA-damaging agents (14Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J.

Although this evidence exemplifies the importance of p53 in neuronal death, the signals that link DNA damage to p53 induction and activation are not clear. p53 function is regulated in a variety of ways, which include acetylation and phosphorylation on at least 11 described sites (17Burns T. El-Deiry W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 18Caspari T. Curr.

In terms of the latter function, it has been proposed that modification of different sites may lead to unique and defined p53 responses related to cell death or cell cycle arrest. For example, modification on Ser-46 has been shown to activate the proapoptotic p53AIP1 gene (19Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). The presence of a myriad of regulatory mechanisms likely contributes to the flexibility and cell specificity of p53-mediated events. ATM and Chk2 are two regulators of p53 activation in proliferating cells exposed to DNA damage. The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene is critical for cellular responses to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E.

Patients or mice defective in this gene display defective cell cycle arrest, hypersensitivity to DNA damage, and tumor disposition (22Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Clin. Immunol. 1996; 16: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Numerous reports have argued that ATM mediates activation of p53 through Chk2, the mammalian homologue to the Rad53 Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint gene (23Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S.

In this simplified model, Chk2 is phosphorylated by ATM on several sites (25Melchionna R. Chen X. Blasina A. McGowan C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 26Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This includes direct phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7002-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the consequences of phosphorylation of MDM2 by ATM are unknown. We have previously reported that cortical neurons exposed to the DNA-damaging agents such as camptothecin display increased p53 levels and a requirement for p53 in death (14Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fortin A. Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Kushwaha N. Hickman E.S. Thompson C.S. Hakim A. Albert P.R. Cecconi F. Helin K. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. We explored the possibility that this up-regulation occurs through the ATM/Chk2 pathway. Accordingly, we examined whether ATM or Chk2 deficiency would affect p53 stability and p53-dependent death in response to DNA damage induced by topoisomerase (topo) I or II inhibition. We observed inhibition of p53 up-regulation and delay of death with ATM deficiency with both DNA-damaging conditions. However, in contrast to established models of Chk2 action in proliferating cells, Chk2 had no affect on apoptosis or p53 stability in the present death paradigms. This indicates, for the first time, that ATM can regulate p53-mediated death of neurons independently of Chk2.

Briefly, cortical neurons were dissociated from cortex and plated in 35-mm dishes, pre-coated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml), at a density of 2–3 × 106 cell/well or at 300,000 cells/well for each well of a 24-well plate. Neurons were cultured in serum-free medium (F12:minimum essential medium (1:1) supplemented with 6 mg/ml d-glucose, 100 μg/ml transferrin, 25 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 60 μm putrescine, and 30 nm selenium). Under these conditions, the cultures typically contain more than 99% neurons (33Giovanni A. Keramaris E. Morris E.J. Hou S.T. O'Hare M. Dyson N. Robertson G.S. Slack R.S. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11553-11560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). 48 h after initial plating, camptothecin (10 μm), ALLN (50 μm), etoposide (10 μm), and/or flavopiridol (1 μm) were added to neuronal cultures as indicated. Cell Survival—After drug treatment (as mentioned above) and at the indicated time points, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of cell lysis buffer (0.1× phosphate-buffer saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% cetylmethylammonium bromide). This disrupts the cell membrane while the nuclei remain intact and distinguishable under phase-contrast microscopy. Nuclei that display blebbing, disruption of nuclear membrane, or phase bright bodies were excluded. Percent survival was calculated as the number of live neurons in drug-treated compared with number of neurons in untreated cultures. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. Knockout Mice—For knockout studies, each embryo was dissected and plated individually. ATM (Jackson Laboratories) and Chk2 (C57BL/6 background)-deficient neurons were obtained from embryos derived from heterozygous pairings. In each experiment, neurons acquired from wild type littermate embryos were used as controls. ATM and Chk2 knockout embryos were genotyped as follows: ATM was genotyped using GCTGCCATACTTGATCCATG (oIMR640) and TCCGAATTTGCAGGAGTTG (oIMR641) primers to detect the wild-type allele (147 bp) and CTTGGGTGGAGAGGCTATTC (oIMR013) and AGGTGAGATGACAGGAGATC (oIMR014) primers were used to detect the targeted allele (280 bp) in one PCR reaction. PCR conditions were 94 °C, 3 min (1 cycle); 94 °C, 20 s; 64 °C, 30 s (–0.5 °C/cycle); 72 °C, 35 s (12 cycles); 94 °C, 20 s; 58 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 35 s (25 cycles); and 72 °C, 2 min. Chk2 was genotyped using GTGTGCGCCACCACTATCCTG (WT1) and CCCTTGGCCATGTTTCATCTG (WT2) primers to detect the untargeted allele (500 bp) and CAGGAGGTGGTGGCTTACTTTA (NEO1) and CAAATTAAGGGCCAGCTCATTC (NEO2) to detect the targeted allele (900 bp) in two PCR reactions. For the wild type allele, the PCR conditions were 95 °C, 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min (35 cycles); and 72 °C; 1 min. For the null allele, the PCR conditions were 95 °C, 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min (35 cycles); and 72 °C; 1 min. Caspase Activity—Caspase activity was determined utilizing DEVD-AFC as previously described (34Stefanis L. Park D.S. Yan C.Y. Farinelli S.E. Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30663-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). TUNEL Labeling—TUNEL analyses was performed as previously described (35Keramaris E. Stefanis L. Maclaurin J. Harada N. Takaku K. Ishikawa T. Taketo M.M. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Slack R.S. Park D.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Quantitation was performed by scoring at least 100 cells/well for TUNEL labeling, and condensed/fragmented nuclei were visualized by Hoechst staining. The values are expressed in relation to the total number of Hoechst (healthy plus fragmented/condensed)-positive cells. Western Blot Analysis—Cortical neurons were dissociated and cultured as mentioned above. At the indicated time points, neurons were harvested and lysed using SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm DTT, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Whole cell protein extracts were heated (95 °C, 5 min), and extracts were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE and transferred on nitrocellulose membranes. A Western blot analysis was performed as previously described utilizing phospho-p53 (Ser-15) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; 1:1000), p53-Ab-1 antibody (Oncogene Research Products; 1:1000), p53 1C12 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; 1:2000), and/or MDM2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SMP14; 1:000). The protein bands were detected using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL system and subjected to densitometric analysis. All blots were reprobed and normalized to B-actin (Clone AC-74; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., 1:3000). p53 Induction/Stability by DNA Damage Exposure—As we (14Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have previously reported, exposure of cortical neurons to the DNA-damaging agent and topo I inhibitor, camptothecin, results in elevated p53 levels and apoptotic death. p53 function is an absolute requirement in this model, because p53-deficient neurons are robustly resistant to death (14Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Xiang H. Kinoshita Y. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11553-11560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To begin to understand the mechanism by which p53 induction is regulated, we first examined whether p53 is phosphorylated at Ser-15, a site associated with p53 stability/activity (20Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 21Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.

Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Utilizing a phosphoepitope-specific antibody specific to this site and Western blot analyses, we observed that Ser-15 phosphorylation accompanied p53 induction (Fig. 1, A and B). When the relative ratio of Ser-15 phosphorylation/total p53 was calculated, we observed a sharp increase in the specific activity of Ser-15 phosphorylation, which preceded p53 induction. To ensure the specific nature of the Ser-15 signal, we induced p53 by use of a proteasomal inhibitor, ALLN. With this treatment, the rapid turnover of p53 is suppressed. Accordingly, p53 can accumulate without modulatory post-translational modifications such as Ser-15 phosphorylation. In comparison to p53 induction induced by DNA damage, no Ser-15 signal was observed indicating the specific nature of the Ser-15 antibody (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Analyses of the specificity of the Ser-15 p53 antibody. Embryonic cortical neuronal cultures were treated for camptothecin (campto; 10 μm) or the proteasomal inhibitor ALLN (50 μm) for the indicated times. ALLN treatment induced p53 levels through inhibition of the proteasome without concomitant Ser-15 phosphorylation. Western blot analyses using p53 and Ser-15-p53 phosphospecific antibodies are shown. Actin is provided as loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our previous work indicate that at least three upstream signaling pathways are necessary for activation of the conserved mitochondrial pathway of death in response to DNA damage induced by topo I inhibition. These include 1) involvement of p53 mentioned above (14Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2) activation and requirement of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), which normally regulate cell cycle progression (32Park D.S. Morris E.J. Padmanabhan J. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 36Park D.S. Morris E.J. Bremner R. Keramaris E. Padmanabhan J. Rosenbaum M. Shelanski M.L. Geller H.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3104-3114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 3) the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (38Ghahremani M. Keramaris E. Shree T. Xia Z. Davis R. Flavell R. Slack R. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35586-35596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Inhibition of either the JNK or CDK pathways, although sufficient to prevent caspase activation and death had no affect on global p53 induction (14Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ghahremani M. Keramaris E. Shree T. Xia Z. Davis R. Flavell R. Slack R. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35586-35596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The converse was also true; inhibition of p53 blocks death without preventing the activation of the JNKs or CDKs. This suggests that CDKs, JNKs, and p53 are regulated on separate pathways, which only converge to modulate activation of the mitochondrial pathway of death (Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation). However, it is possible that CDKs, directly, or indirectly, may modulate post-translational modification of p53. To ensure that this was not the case for Ser-15 phosphorylation, we examined whether cotreatment with the CDK inhibitor flavopiridol would alter p53 Ser-15 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), no significant difference was observed when compared with camptothecin treatment alone. Taken together, this suggests that the CDKs do not regulate p53 action and that other signals must perform this function. ATM/p53 and Neuronal Death Induced by DNA Damage— One candidate for regulation of p53 is ATM, and we therefore examined whether ATM deficiency would modulate the response to topo I inhibition. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, ATM deficiency significantly reduced both Ser-15 phosphorylation and total p53 induction when compared with wild type or heterozygous controls. However, it is important to emphasize that p53 induction was not totally abolished. MDM2 levels, on the other hand, remained unchanged. ATM also did not affect the induction of c-Jun (data not shown), which we have previously reported to occur independently of p53 in this death model (38Ghahremani M. Keramaris E. Shree T. Xia Z. Davis R. Flavell R. Slack R. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35586-35596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This indicates that the effect of ATM deficiency was not general to all transcription factors and provides further evidence that p53 and c-Jun regulatory pathways are distinct. Importantly, ATM-deficient neurons were also resistant to neuronal death induced by camptothecin. As shown in Fig. 5, ATM-deficient neurons were significantly resistant to topoisomerase I inhibition-induced death when compared with heterozygous controls (∼55% survival versus 25% in controls). However, unlike p53 deficiency where protection can be sustained at 3 days (14Morris E.J. Keramaris E. Rideout H.J. Slack R.S. Dyson N.J. Stefanis L. Park D.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5017-5026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), protection by ATM deficiency was transient. Significant protection was only observed 12 h after camptothecin treatment but not at 24 h. This is likely, because p53 levels were not completely abolished. Phase micrographs reveal degenerating processes and apoptotic soma in control camptothecin-treated cultures, whereas ATM-deficient neuronal cultures had appreciably less apoptotic bodies (Fig. 6). Consistent with the protection observed by nuclear counts, ATM-deficient neurons treated with camptothecin also showed less DEVD-AFC cleavage activity, which reflects caspase 3-like activity (Fig. 7). Heterozygous control cultures showed approximately 2.5 times the activity as observed in ATM-deficient control cultures. Finally, to confirm that apoptotic death was reduced in ATM-deficient cultures, we analyzed for death by TUNEL. As shown in Fig. 8, ATM-deficient cultures also had significantly less TUNEL-positive cells when compared with littermate controls.Fig. 4ATM deficiency attenuates the induction of Ser-15 p53 and p53 levels induced by treatment of cortical neurons with the topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide.

https://openalex.org/W2002232559,"Three cytoplasmic loops in the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin, C2, C3, and C4, have been implicated as key sites for binding and activation of the visual G protein transducin. Non-helical portions of the C2- and C3-loops and the cytoplasmic helix-8 from the C4 loop were targeted for a “gain-of-function” mutagenesis to identify rhodopsin residues critical for transducin activation. Mutant opsins with residues 140–148 (C2-loop), 229–244 (C3-loop), or 310–320 (C4-loop) substituted by poly-Ala sequences of equivalent lengths served as templates for mutagenesis. The template mutants with poly-Ala substitutions in the C2- and C3-loops formed the 500-nm absorbing pigments but failed to activate transducin. Reverse substitutions of the Ala residues by rhodopsin residues have been generated in each of the templates. Significant (∼50%) restoration of the rhodopsin/transducin coupling was achieved with re-introduction of residues Cys140/Lys141 and Arg147/Phe148 into the C2 template. The reverse substitutions of the C3-loop residues Thr229/Val230 and Ser240/Thr242/Thr243/Gln244 produced a pigment with a full capacity for transducin activation. The C4 template mutant was unable to bind 11-cis-retinal, and the presence of Asn310/Lys311 was required for correct folding of the protein. Subsequent mutagenesis of the C4-loop revealed the role of Phe313 and Met317. On the background of Asn310/Lys311, the inclusion of Phe313 and Met317 produced a mutant pigment with the potency of transducin activation equal to that of the wild-type rhodopsin. Overall, our data support the role of the three cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin and suggest that residues adjacent to the transmembrane helices are most important for transducin activation.

Overall, our data support the role of the three cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin and suggest that residues adjacent to the transmembrane helices are most important for transducin activation. The visual receptor, rhodopsin, is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; R, rhodopsin; R*, light-activated (Meta II) rhodopsin; Gt, rod G protein transducin; C1-C4, cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin; H1-H7, transmembrane helices of rhodopsin; H8, cytoplasmic helix 8 of rhodopsin; E, extracellular; ROS, rod outer segment(s); GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). It belongs to the class A GPCRs, the largest and the most studied within the GPCR superfamily (1Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 2Menon S.T. Han M.

With a characteristic seven-transmembrane segment topography (helices H1–H7), a rhodopsin molecule forms three intradiscal (extracellular) (E1– E3) and three cytoplasmic loops (C1–C3). A fourth cytoplasmic loop (C4) results from the insertion of the palmitoyl groups attached to two cysteine residues within the C-terminal tail of rhodopsin, Cys322 and Cys323. The key feature of the C4 loop is its largely helical structure (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). The C4 helix 8 (H8) stretches along the membrane plane through Cys322/Cys323 in the direction almost perpendicular to H7. Deep within the helical transmembrane bundle lies the light-sensitive chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, covalently linked via a protonated Schiff base to Lys296 in H7. The ground state of rhodopsin (R) is stabilized by multiple contacts of the apoprotein with 11-cis-retinal and intermolecular interactions among transmembrane α-helices (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). The light-triggered 11-cis/trans-isomerization of retinal initiates a series of conformational changes in the rhodopsin molecule, leading to the transitional Meta II state (R*). In the Meta II conformation, the receptor cytoplasmic surface exposes sites for the interaction and activation of visual G protein, transducin (Gt) (2Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol.

The light-induced rearrangements in rhodopsin have been extensively studied and include rigid body movements of at least H3, H6, and H7, which relay the conformational change to cytoplasmic loops C2, C3, and C4 (7Hubbell W.L.

While yielding a wealth of conformational information on R and R* using techniques based on cysteine reactivity such as fluorescence/spin labeling and cross-linking, the cysteine-scanning mutagenesis might not have been an optimal approach for the identification of the R*-Gt contact residues. Ala-scanning mutagenesis is a widely adopted methodology to study protein-protein interaction sites. However, Ala-scanning mutagenesis of the R loops C1–C4 revealed only few mutants within the C3-loop that were defective in Gt activation (23Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, we have adopted a “gain-of-function” mutational approach to identify rhodopsin residues critical for Gt activation. Rhodopsin regions targeted for mutagenesis included loop C4 and non-helical portions of C2 and C3. Three mutant opsins with residues 140–148 (C2), 229–244 (C3), or 310–320 (C4) substituted by poly-Ala sequences of equivalent lengths served as templates for mutagenesis. Reverse substitutions of the Ala residues by rhodopsin residues have been generated in each of the templates. This approach was based on the assumption that relatively large poly-Ala cassettes replacing flexible cytoplasmic regions of C2 and C3 outside the helical bundle of R would not interfere with the protein folding, 11-cis-retinal binding, and the ability to undergo light-induced conformational change. Furthermore, mutations of the template constructs causing a gain in activation of Gt are likely to indicate direct contact residues. The same approach was extended to the C4 region to address discrepancies with respect to its role in Gt activation.

Primers for PCR were synthesized by IDT, Inc. n-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was from Calbiochem. Bovine retinas were purchased from Lawson Co. (Lincoln, NE). Transducin was purified from dark-adapted retinas as described previously (24Yamazaki A. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 11-cis-retinal was kindly provided by Dr. R. Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina). The C-terminal bovine opsin 11-mer peptide was custom-made by Sigma. The synthetic opsin cDNA in the pMT4 vector and the pGAD10 bovine retinal cDNA library were kindly provided by Drs. D. Oprian (Brandeis University) and W. Baehr (University of Utah), respectively. Monoclonal 1D4 antibodies specific to the rhodopsin C terminus were obtained from National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Mutagenesis—All of the opsin mutants were constructed using standard PCR techniques. To generate mutations in the C2-loop, PCR reactions were carried out on the pMT4-opsin template with a phosphorylated forward primer encoding the mutation and a reverse primer containing a NotI site and a forward primer containing an EcoRI site and a phosphorylated reverse primer encoding the mutation. PCR products were ligated to each other with 3 units of T4 DNA ligase for 1 h at 37 °C. Appropriate ligation adducts (∼1050 bp) were digested with NotI and EcoRI and ligated into the pMT4 vector. A similar approach was applied for the C3-loop mutants. A unique PstI restriction site in the middle of this loop was utilized. To construct the C4-loop mutants, each mutation encoded in a primer was flanked by ∼15–17 nucleotides of the wild-type opsin sequence to facilitate specific annealing to the template. The C4-loop primers were paired with the NotI primer. After the first-round PCR, amplified fragments (∼150 bp) were paired with the EcoRI primer for the second-round PCR. The full-length mutant cDNAs were digested with EcoRI and NotI and inserted into the pMT4 vector. The bovine-long wavelength (red) cone opsin was amplified by PCR from the pGAD10 retinal cDNA library. The 5′-PCR primer included an EcoRI site, and the 3′-primer encoded a NotI site and the additional 8-codon epitope for antibody 1D4. The PCR product (∼1100 bp) was isolated, digested with NotI and EcoRI, and ligated into the pMT4 vector. The sequence of the PCR-amplified bovine cDNA was identical to the sequence of the red cone opsin deposited with GI:12247463 (GenBank™, NCBI). The strategy used to generate the red opsin mutants in the C3-loop, Ala245/Ile246 → Thr/Val and Ile246 → Ala, was similar to that described for the C2-loop R mutants. All of the constructs were sequenced at the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. Expression and Purification of Rhodopsin and Red Cone Opsin Mutants—COS-7 cells were grown on 15-cm plates with Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with 20 μg of DNA in the presence of 50 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Typically, for each mutant, cells were harvested 60–70 h after transfection from 4–12 plates and washed with phosphate-buffered saline four times. The following procedures were performed under dim red light or in darkness. COS-7 cells were incubated with 20 μm 11-cis-retinal for 3 h at 4 °C and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2 (buffer A). The cell membranes were solubilized in 10 ml of buffer A containing 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 4 °C. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. 1D4-Sepharose 4B (200-μl bed volume) immunoaffinity matrix prepared as described previously (25Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 84: 8874-8878Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar) was added to the supernatant and incubated with constant mixing overnight at 4 °C. The matrix was washed three times with 5 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and twice with 5 ml of the buffer containing 2 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.0) and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (buffer B). Rhodopsin constructs were eluted with 250 μl of buffer B containing the C-terminal opsin peptide (100 μm). To obtain the plasma membrane preparations containing mutant opsins, COS-7 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. The cells were then sheared using a 27-gauge needle and layered on a 37% sucrose solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 4 mm MgCl2. After centrifugation (20 min, 50,000 × g, 4 °C), the plasma membranes were collected from the top of the sucrose cushion, resuspended in the same buffer without sucrose, and washed three times. The plasma membrane preparations were then mixed with bovine serum albumin (20 mg/ml) and 100 μm 11-cis-retinal for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice by centrifugation, aliquoted, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. To assess the levels of expression of mutant pigments in preparations of COS-7 cell plasma membranes and the yields of immunopurified mutant pigments, the mutants were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with 1D4 antibodies according to standard procedures. Absorption Spectroscopy—Absorption spectra were obtained for the 1D4-ummunopurified proteins at 20 °C before and after the samples were exposed to light using a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. Concentrations of mutant opsins were determined using ϵ500 for rhodopsin of 40,600 m–1 cm–1 (26Wald G. Brown P.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1953; 37: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). GTPγS-binding Assay—Light-dependent activation of purified bovine rod Gt by mutant rhodopsins was measured using 50 nm immunopurified pigments and 3 μm Gt in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were prepared under dim red light and then bleached for 30 s before the addition of 20 μm [35S]GTPγS (2 Ci/mmol). At 30-, 60-, and 120-s time intervals, 20-μl aliquots were removed from the reactions and mixed with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm GTP. Samples were then applied to nitrocellulose filters (Whatman), washed three times with 3 ml of the same buffer without GTP, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The rates of GTPγS binding for each mutant pigment are given as an average rate obtained using preparations from three independent transfections. Each transfection experiment with the mutant opsins included control transfection of the wild-type R. Light-dependent activation of bovine rod Gt by mutant red cone opsins was measured as described above using COS-7 plasma membrane preparations (20 μg of total protein in 30-μl GTPγS-binding reaction). Miscellaneous Procedures—Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay using IgG as a standard (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). GTPγS-binding data were fit using linear regression. The GraphPad Prism (version 2) software was used to plot graphs and absorption spectra. Rhodopsin Mutants with Poly-Ala Substitutions of the C2–C4 Loops—Exposed non-helical regions of C2 (amino acids 140–148) and C3 (amino acids 229–244) were selected for poly-Ala replacements on the basis of the crystal structures of R (4Palczewski K.

The C4-region (amino acids 310–320) was replaced by a poly-Ala sequence as it contains residues implicated earlier in transducin activation (15Marin E.P. Krishna A.G. Zvyaga T.A. Isele J. Siebert F.

The three template R mutants, C2A, C3A, and C4A, were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (Table I and Fig. 1). The mutants were expressed at levels comparable to the wild-type R as determined by Western blot analysis of the COS-7 cell plasma membrane preparations (Fig. 2A). The preparations of C2A and C4A reveal the presence of an additional immunoreactive band of ∼33 kDa that apparently corresponds to non-glycosylated opsin mutants (28Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G.

Concentrations of R, C2A, and C3A were adjusted based on absorption spectra. C4A (•) was added in the amount producing equivalent Western blot signal with 1D4 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For functional tests, the mutant pigments were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on 1D4-Sepharose (25Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 84: 8874-8878Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A low pH and ionic strength buffer was used to achieve selective elution of the correctly folded retinal-bound pigments from 1D4-Sepharose (29Ridge K.D. Lu Z. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Consistent with misfolding of a fraction of the C2A protein, the yield of the retinal-bound immunopurified pigment was significantly lower than that for the wild-type R and C3A (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the C4A mutant did not form the 500-nm absorbing pigment (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the C4-loop contains residues that are essential for proper folding of R. The photobleached wild-type R effectively activated transducin in the GTPγS-binding assay, whereas C2A and C3A had no effect (Fig. 2C). Thus, these two mutant constructs represented suitable templates for a “gain-of-function” mutagenesis. Reflecting the lack of a correctly folded pigment, C4A also failed to activate Gt (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained using COS-7 cell plasma membrane preparations of R and the template mutants in the GTPγS-binding assay (data not shown). To determine whether the template mutants C2A and C3A do not activate transducin because they do not bind Gt or because they cannot induce nucleotide exchange on the bound Gt, we carried out in vitro translation of Gtα in the presence of [35S]methionine. The binding of [35S]Gtα reconstituted with purified Gtβγ to the wild-type R and its mutants was assessed using the plasma membrane preparations of appropriately transfected COS7 cells. However, the background binding of Gt to mock-transfected COS cell membranes was quite high, precluding reliable determination of the specifically bound Gt. This nonspecific binding was not reversed by GTPγS (data not shown). Mutagenesis of the C2 Loop—The first C2-loop mutant, C2–1, was made by incorporation of rhodopsin residues Cys140/Lys141 into the C2A construct (Table I). Relative to C2A, C2–1 yielded higher amounts of the immunopurified 500-nm absorbing pigment (data not shown). Unlike C2A, C2–1 was capable of activating transducin with a rate of 12% of that for the wild-type R*, indicating a moderate role for these residues in the R*/Gt coupling (Fig. 3). Since C2–1 had improved expression yield, subsequent mutants, C2–2, C2–3, and C2–4, were generated by the addition of R residues to the C2–1 template (Table I). Expression of C2–2, C2–3, and C2–4 produced amounts of the retinal bound pigments similar to the wild-type R (data not shown). Although the presence of Phe142/Met143 and Ser144/Asn145/Phe146 in C2–2 and C2–3, respectively, had no significant effect on the ability of the pigment to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Gt, the addition of Arg147/Phe148 in C2–4 notably enhanced the rate of transducin activation (Fig. 3). The capacity of C2–4 to stimulate Gt indicates the role of Arg147/Phe148, and to a lesser degree Cys140/Lys141, in the R*/Gt coupling. Since C2–4 activated transducin only at ∼50% of the rhodopsin-induced rate, other C2-loop residues may contribute to the R*/Gt interface indirectly by influencing the overall conformation of the loop. This possibility was tested by making the C2–5 mutant lacking residues Ser144/Asn145/Phe146 (Table I). Even though these residues did not impart a gain of Gt activation onto C2–3, C2–5 was a less efficient catalyst of the GTPγS binding to Gt than the wild-type R* (Fig. 3). Mutagenesis of the C3 Loop—The choice for the initial mutations in the C3-loop, C3–1 and C3–2 (Table I), was made based on the results of the Cys-scanning mutagenesis of this region that showed impaired Gtα activation by R mutants with substitutions of residues Thr229, Val230, Thr242, Thr243, and Gln244 (20Yang K. Farrens D.L. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12464-12469Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The yields of immunopurified pigments C3–1 and C3–2 containing reverse-substituted residues Thr229/Val230 and Thr242/Thr243/Gln244, respectively, were equivalent to the yield of the wild-type R and C3A (data not shown). Nonetheless, the mutants have not regained any significant ability to activate Gt (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the C3–3 mutant combining the five residues was capable of stimulating GTPγS binding to Gtα with a rate of 75% of that for R*. Previous studies have yielded inconsistent data on the role of Ser240 in the R*/Gt coupling (14Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Graham R.M. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14767-14774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yang K. Farrens D.L. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Ser240 was next introduced into the C3–3 mutant background. The resulting C3–4 mutant was indistinguishable from the wild-type R* with respect to its ability to activate Gt, supporting contribution of this residue to the R*/Gt interface (Fig. 4). Mutagenesis of the C4 Loop—The immunopurified C4A mutant did not bind 11-cis-retinal and appeared on the SDS gel as three bands corresponding to ∼40, 37, and 33 kDa. The faster migrating bands most probably represent monoglycosylated and non-glycosylated opsins (28Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We first attempted to identify the C4-loop residues required for correct folding of the pigment. The Cys-scanning mutagenesis has indicated the potential role of residues Asn310, Lys311, Phe313, and Met317 in the R*/Gt coupling (22Cai K. Klein-Seetharaman J. Farrens D. Zhang C. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7925-7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These residues were incorporated into the C4A template to produce the C4–1 mutant (Table I). Unlike C4A and similar to the wild-type R, C4–1 migrated on a gel as a single fully glycosylated 40-kDa band (Fig. 5A). It also bound 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 5B) and activated Gt analogously to the wild-type R (Fig. 5C). The C4–2 and C4–3 mutants containing residues Asn310/Lys311 and Phe313/Met317, respectively, have been generated to narrow down the folding determinants. Western blot analysis revealed that immunopurified C4–3, similarly to C4A, contains additional faster mig"

Translation initiation is regulated by interaction between PHAS-I and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Although angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy requires the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the ROS sensitivity of these events and their upstream activators remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of ROS in the regulation of PHAS-I phosphorylation on Thr-70 and Ser-65, an event required for the release of eIF4E from PHAS-I. Ang II-induced Ser-65 phosphorylation was ROS-dependent as assessed by pretreatment with ebselen (3.6 ± 0.2 versus 1.1 ± 0.2), diphenylene iodonium (3.6 ± 0.2 versus 1.0 ± 0.1), and N-acetyl cysteine (3.6 ± 0.2 versus 1.2 ± 0.1), but Ang II-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr-70 was ROS-insensitive. Although phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway inhibition by LY294004 blocked both Ser-65 and Thr-70 phosphorylation (3.8 ± 0.1 versus 0.8 ± 0.1 and 3.2 ± 0.2 versus 1.0 ± 0.01, respectively), protein phosphatase 2A inhibition by okadaic acid selectively increased (3.3 ± 0.1 versus 5.2 ± 0.1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition by SB203580 selectively decreased (3.8 ± 0.1 versus 1.4 ± 0.3) Ser-65 phosphorylation. Dominant negative Akt adenovirus also inhibited only Ser-65 phosphorylation (3.7 ± 0.1 versus 1.0 ± 0.03).

Translation initiation, the limiting step for protein synthesis, is critically dependent on phosphorylation of the PHAS-I-eIF4E complex. eIF4E is tightly regulated by interaction with PHAS-I, which acts as a translational repressor (7Lin T. Kong X. Haystead T. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrance J. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). When eIF4E is bound to PHAS-I, it binds to mRNA but cannot form an active initiation complex (8Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). However, upon stimulation with growth factors such as Ang II or IGF-1, eIF4E is released from PHAS-I and forms an active complex with eIF4G (9Fleurent M. Gingras A. Sonenberg N. Meloche S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; : 4006-4012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Vary T. Jefferson L. Kimball S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: E58-E64PubMed Google Scholar). PHAS-I is phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues including Thr-70, Thr-37, Thr-46, and Ser-65 (11Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G. McMahon L. Capaldo C. Abraham R. Lawrence J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33836-33843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The temporal sequence of these phosphorylations remains debatable; however, there is good consensus that phosphorylation of Ser-65, which is necessary for the dissociation of PHAS-I from eIF4E (12Heesom K. Denton R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 489-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), requires prior phosphorylation of Thr-37, Thr-46, Thr-70 (11Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G. McMahon L. Capaldo C. Abraham R. Lawrence J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33836-33843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Several Ang II-dependent signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of PHAS-I phosphorylation. Among these are ERK1/2 MAP kinases (7Lin T. Kong X. Haystead T. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrance J. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), p38 MAP kinase (14Morley S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway, including Akt (15Mendez R. Myers M. White M. Rhoads R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 16Gingras A. Kennedy S. O'Leary M. Sonsnberg N. Hay N.

Of these signaling intermediates, Akt (18Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Yin Q. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22699-22704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and p38 MAP kinase (19Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) have been shown to be redox-sensitive. However, it remains to be determined whether the sensitivity of these known regulators of PHAS-I to ROS mediates the Ang II response and confers ROS sensitivity to PHAS-I phosphorylation by Ang II.Little attention has been given to the possible role of phosphatases in the regulation of translation initiation and PHAS-I phosphorylation, although recent results suggest the possibility that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is involved in this event (20Gingras A. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). In yeast, PP2A activation causes a dramatic decrease in translation initiation (20Gingras A. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for this effect is unclear, it may involve dephosphorylation of either PHAS-I or eIF4E. Treatment with okadaic acid increases PHAS-I phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (21Lin T. Lawrance J. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: S18-S24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, PP2A co-immunoprecipitates with p70S6 kinase, a rapamycin-sensitive, upstream regulator of Ang II-induced PHAS-I phosphorylation (22Peterson R. Desai B. Hardwick J. Schreiber S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This is interesting because PP2A has been shown to be ROS-sensitive: sublethal levels of oxidant stress have been shown to suppress PP2A in T cells (23Whisler R. Goyette M. Grants I. Newhouse Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and PP2A activity has been found to be modulated by H2O2 and glutathione (24Rao R. Clayton L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that PP2A is a potential mediator of Ang II-regulated translation initiation.The ROS sensitivity of Ang II-dependent PHAS-I phosphorylation and the signaling pathways that regulate this event remain unclear. In this study, we show differential, site-specific ROS sensitivity of Ang II-dependent PHAS-I phosphorylation on two sites, Thr-70 and Ser-65. In addition, we demonstrate the involvement of both ROS-sensitive and ROS-insensitive signaling pathways that are differentially and specifically involved in the regulation of these phosphorylation events. We show, for the first time, the ROS sensitivity of PP2A activity in response to Ang II and its involvement in the regulation of PHAS-I phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—DPI was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells between passage 6 and 20 were made quiescent in 0.1% calf serum for 24 - 48 h and used at confluence for experiments. For VSMCs stably transfected with a vector overexpressing catalase or with an empty vector control (26Zafari A.M. Ushio-Fukai M. Akers M. Yin Q. Shah A. Harrison D.G. Taylor W.R. Griendling K.K. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), Geneticin (400 μg/ml) was added to the media.Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100 as described (27Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T. Byron K. Samarel A. Lucchesi P. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes. Site-specific, phospho-specific PHAS-I (Thr-70 and Ser-65), p38, Akt, and ERK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling) were used for Western blotting. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using NIH Image software.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Growth-arrested VSMCs were treated with 10 μm SB203580 or 5 μm Akt inhibitor for 45 min prior to treatment with Ang II for 30 min. VSMC lysates were prepared as described (27Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T. Byron K. Samarel A. Lucchesi P. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 841-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated using anti-Akt or anti-p38 MAP kinase antibodies. Samples were incubated with GST-PHAS-I (5 μg) and ATP (100 μm) in kinase reaction buffer for 10 min as described (27Sabri A. Govindarajan G. Griffin T. Byron K. Samarel A. Lucchesi P. Circ.

PP2A activity was measured according to the protocol supplied by Calbiochem. Briefly, PP2A immunoprecipitates were incubated with a PP2A-specific substrate for 5 min in PP2A reaction buffer (Calbiochem). The reaction was terminated by the addition of molybdate dye/additive mixture. Concentrations of free phosphate, released by PP2A, were measured in 96-well plates in a microplate reader at 540 nm.Data Analysis—Blots shown are representative of at least three experiments. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance, followed by t test, was used for comparisons among multiple groups. Differences among means were considered significant at p < 0.05. Data were analyzed using Prism software.RESULTSDifferential ROS Sensitivity of Ang II-induced PHAS-I Phosphorylation on Thr-70 and Ser-65—In this study, we focused on the phosphorylation of two critical residues of PHAS-I, Ser-65, a site required for the release of eIF4E and its subsequent function in translation initiation, and Thr-70, the phosphorylation of which must precede that of Ser-65. Fig. 1 shows the time course of PHAS-I phosphorylation by Ang II on these two sites as detected by site-specific anti-phospho PHAS-I antibodies. Maximal PHAS-I phosphorylation on Thr-70 occurred at 15 min (3.6 ± 0.1-fold versus control), whereas maximal phosphorylation of Ser-65 followed at 30 min (3.6 ± 0.2) (Fig. 1).To determine the ROS sensitivity of the phosphorylation events that regulate translation initiation, we pretreated the cells with a panel of ROS inhibitors: the glutathione peroxidase mimetic ebselen, DPI to inhibit flavin-containing oxidases, and NAC, and examined the effects of these antioxidants on site-specific PHAS-I phosphorylation. Preliminary experiments (data not shown) and previous studies (4Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2367) Google Scholar, 28Seshiah P. Weber D. Rocic P. Valppu L. Taniyama Y. Griendling K. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) verified that these compounds completely inhibit Ang II-induced ROS formation. All inhibitors completely blocked Ang II-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-65 (ebselen (3.6 ± 0.2 versus 1.0 ± 0.2), DPI (3.6 ± 0.2 versus1.0 ± 0.1), and NAC (3.6 ± 0.2 versus 1.2 ± 0.1)), while having no significant effect on the phosphorylation of Thr-70 (Fig. 2A). Similar results for Ser-65 (3.5 ± 0.1 versus 1.2 ± 0.3) and Thr-70 (3.3 ± 0.1 versus 3.2 ± 0.1) were obtained in cells stably overexpressing catalase to prevent hydrogen peroxide formation (Fig. 2B). Incubation of VSMCs with 100 units/ml polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase for 24 h to scavenge superoxide (29Beckman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6884-6892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had no effect on Ser-65 or Thr-70 PHAS-I phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data indicate that the phosphorylation of Ser-65 is mediated by H2O2, whereas the phosphorylation of Thr-70 is not.Fig. 2Ang II-induced Ser-65, but not Thr-70, phosphorylation is ROS-dependent.

Using site-specific anti-phospho Thr-70 and Ser-65 antibodies, we investigated the relative roles of these signaling pathways in the regulation of both Ser-65 and Thr-70 phosphorylation in VSMCs (Fig. 3).Fig. 3ERK1/2, p38, Akt differentially regulate site-specific PHAS-I phosphorylation in response to Ang II.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-p38 MAP kinase or anti-Akt antibodies as indicated. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phospho-Ser-65-PHAS-I antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Both the MEK inhibitor, U0126, and the specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, at concentrations that block activation of the respective kinases (33Rocic P. Govindarajan G. Sabri A. Lucchesi P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C90-C99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), completely inhibited both Thr-70 and Ser-65 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, SB203580, the specific inhibitor of the redox-sensitive p38 MAPK, as well as dominant negative Akt adenovirus (DN-Akt-Adv), had no effect on the phosphorylation of Thr-70 but inhibited Ang II-dependent Ser-65 phosphorylation by 67 ± 2% and 74 ± 3%, respectively (Fig. 3A, lane 5, and 3B). To determine whether Akt or p38 MAP kinase is the actual kinase responsible for direct phosphorylation of Ser-65, we performed in vitro kinase assays in which we either immunoprecipitated p38 MAP kinase in the presence of 5 μm Akt inhibitor or immunoprecipitated Akt in the presence of 10 μm SB203580. Ser-65 phosphorylation, as detected by the phospho-specific antibody, was observed in both immunoprecipitates because Akt and p38 MAP kinase form a complex in VSMCs (data not shown). However, p38 MAP kinase inhibition had no effect on Ang II-induced Ser-65 phosphorylation, whereas Akt inhibition blocked it completely (Fig. 3C). The same concentration of Akt inhibitor completely blocked Ang II-dependent Akt phosphorylation but had no effect on p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation (data not shown). These data suggest the involvement of ERK1/2 and PI 3-kinase, but not of p38 MAPK or Akt, in the phosphorylation of Thr-70, whereas the subsequent phosphorylation of Ser-65 is dependent on all these signaling intermediates, with Akt as the final effector.The Role of PP2A Phosphatase in Site-specific PHAS-I Phosphorylation—To gain further insight into the differential ROS sensitivity of PHAS-I phosphorylation, we next focused our attention on the PP2A phosphatase, a protein that has been shown to be involved in protein synthesis in yeast. We determined the effect of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of the PP2A phosphatase, on Thr-70 and Ser-65 phosphorylation of PHAS-I (Fig. 4). Okadaic acid had no effect on Ang II-induced Thr-70 phosphorylation. However, it significantly increased Ang II-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-65 (3.3 ± 0.1 versus 5.2 ± 0.1), indicating that PP2A phosphatase regulates Ser-65, but not Thr-70, phosphorylation.Fig. 4PP2A inhibition increases Ang II-dependent Ser-65, but not Thr-70, phosphorylation. A, growth-arrested VSMCs were pretreated with 200 nm okadaic acid for 45 min prior to treatment with 100 nm Ang II for 15 or 30 min. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phospho-Thr-70-PHAS-I antibodies (top blot) or anti-PHAS-I antibodies (bottom blot). Lower panel, average data (mean ± S.E.) from three experiments. *, p < 0.05 versus control.

We measured PP2A activity as nanograms of free phosphate released from a PP2A-specific substrate. In this assay, okadaic acid completely inhibits PP2A activity, confirming specificity for PP2A. We found that PP2A activity was markedly inhibited (3.1 ± 0.1 versus 1.0 ± 0.1) after a 5-min stimulation of VSMCs with Ang II (Fig. 5). Since antioxidants block the phosphorylation of Ser-65, it is possible that antioxidants act by preventing the Ang II-stimulated decrease in PP2A activity. As shown in Fig. 5A, ebselen (1.0 ± 0.1 versus 2.0 ± 0.1), DPI (1.0 ± 0.1 versus 2.1 ± 0.4), and NAC (1.0 ± 0.1 versus 1.9 ± 0.1) significantly attenuated the Ang II-induced inhibition of PP2A activity. Similar results were obtained in cells stably overexpressing catalase (1.0 ± 0.1 versus 1.8 ± 0.1) (Fig. 5A). These data support a partial ROS sensitivity of Ang II-induced PP2A inhibition.Fig. 5Ang II-dependent inhibition of PP2A activity is ROS-sensitive and ERK1/2-, p38 MAPK-, PI 3-kinase-dependent, but Akt-independent.

To determine the kinases that might regulate Ang II-induced PP2A inhibition, we used specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase, p38 MAPK and MEK. LY294002, SB203580, and U0126 prevented the Ang II-induced decrease in PP2A activity (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, DN-Akt-Adv was unable to reverse the effect of Ang II (Fig. 5B). These data implicate PI 3-kinase, p38 MAP kinase, and ERK1/2, but not Akt, as upstream regulators of PP2A activation.DISCUSSIONAng II-induced hypertrophy of VSMCs has been clearly shown"

Using a functional monoclonal antibody against the human β2-adrenergic receptor, a scFv fragment with high affinity for the target epitope was constructed and produced. The fragment recognized the β2-adrenergic receptors on A431 cells, blocked cAMP accumulation induced by the β2-agonist salbutamol, and decreased basal cAMP accumulation in the same cells. Their in vitro activity was tested on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The antibody fragments blocked the chronotropic activity induced by the β2-agonist clenbuterol. They also decreased the in vivo heart beating frequency of mice pretreated with bisoprolol (a β1-adrenergic receptor antagonist) for 4 min after injection.

Most of the structural insights into this family of receptors were obtained from studies of the β2-adrenergic receptor, the first of this family of neurotransmitter receptors to be cloned and sequenced. This receptor is an integral membrane protein consisting of seven membrane spanning α-helices, which form a pharmacophore pocket, linked together by extra- and intracellular loops (2Dixon R.A. Kobilka B.K. Strader D.J. Benovic J.L. Dohlman H.G. Frielle T. Bolanowski M.A. Bennett C.D. Rands E. Diehl R.E. Munford R.A. Slater E.E. Sigal I.S. Caron M.G. Lefkovitz R.J. Strader C.D. Nature. 1986; 321: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). One of the pharmacological challenges posed by this family of receptors is the presence of multiple subtypes, all recognizing the same endogenous ligands. This suggests a high conservation of the pharmacophore for a particular family of receptors, thus explaining the difficulty to synthesize drugs (agonists or antagonists), specific for one of these subtypes. Autoantibodies directed against cardiovascular G protein coupled receptors, functionally interfering with the target, have been described in several cardiovascular diseases. Most of these autoantibodies are directed against the second extracellular loop and are exquisitely specific for one of the receptor subtypes in view of the highly variable structure of this domain (3Mirzadegan T. Benko G. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2759-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Lebesgue et al. (4Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Mijares A. Granier C. Argibay J. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 348: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported the selection of monoclonal antibodies directed against a synthetic peptide whose sequence was derived from the second extracellular loop of G protein-coupled receptors. The selected monoclonal antibody against the β2-adrenergic receptor had partial agonist activity as a dimer and antagonist activity as a monovalent Fab fragment (4Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Mijares A. Granier C. Argibay J. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 348: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5Mijares A. Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This antibody was used to construct a scFv fragment (single chain variable fragment), which was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. In this study, we describe the sequence, the immunochemical, pharmacological, and physiological properties of this scFv fragment. These results open the way for the development of new strategies to synthesize molecules, which are highly specific for one of the subtypes of a particular G protein-coupled receptor family and can allosterically modulate their activity. β2H19C (HWYRATHQEAINCYANETC), corresponding to the second extracellular loop (residues 172–190) of the human β2-adrenergic receptor, were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry with an automated peptide synthesizer (6Neimark J. Briand J.P. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). The β2H19C peptide was biotinylated as described in Ref. 5Mijares A. Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. The peptide was purified by HPLC and its integrity was assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry. The single chain antibody gene fragment encoding the heavy and light variable chain of the monoclonal antibody 6H8 (4Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Mijares A. Granier C. Argibay J. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 348: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was prepared as described in Ref. 7Mousli M. Devaux C. Rochat H. Goyffon M. Billiald P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. scFv 6H8 was created by joining the 6H8 VH and VL genes together by PCR splicing with overlap extensions using oligonucleotides that encoded a 15-amino acid linker (G4-S)3 between the C-terminal of the VH and the N-terminal of the VL gene. The ends of the variable gene were modified by PCR using as primers, VHRev (5′-GGT GCA GCT GCA GCA GTC AGG GTC TGA GC-3′), which encodes the N-terminal wild type sequence of the VH containing a PstI site, VHFor (ACC ACC GGA TCC GCC TCC GCC TGA GGA GAC TGT GAG CGT-3′), which encodes the C terminus of the VH and a part of the linker. VLRev (5′-GGA GGC GGA TCC GGT GGT GGC GGA TCT GGA GGT GGC-3′) and VLFor, containing a XhoI site which encodes 6 His residues (5′-GCA ATT CCT CGA GTT AGT GAT GGT GAT GGT GAT GTT TGA-3′), were used to amplify and modify the VL domain. The scFv gene was inserted in frame with sequence PelB of the expression vector pSW1 (8Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Johnson K.S. Chiswell D.J. Hudson P. Winter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) between the PstI and XhoI sites. The constructed vector pSW1-6H8 His6 was cloned in HB 2151 E. coli strain. The bacterial expression of the recombinant scFv protein and extraction of soluble periplasmic protein are described in Ref. 7Mousli M. Devaux C. Rochat H. Goyffon M. Billiald P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. The periplasmic extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered on 0.45-μm membrane (Millipore) and extensively dialyzed against PBSI (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). The periplasmic extract was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 500 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) and washed with PBSI buffer, and the recombinant protein was eluted with 1 ml of PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CDR, complementary determining region; scFv, single chain antibody variable fragment; ECG, electrocardiogram. supplemented with 500 mm imidazole and immediately dialyzed against PBS. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as a standard procedure using 12.5% acrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Serva) or immunoblotting. For Western blot analysis, the proteins were transferred from the gels onto a PROTRAN nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a mini trans-blot system (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 190 mm glycin, 20% methanol, pH 8.3). The membranes were soaked 1 h in PBS-T (20 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 5% nonfat milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20. This was followed by a 1-h incubation with anti-His tag antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase 1/2000 (Sigma). The antibody was diluted in the blocking solution PBS-T milk. The proteins on the membranes were revealed by the classical procedure of the ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, France). The instrument BIACORE 3000 and all the reagents for analysis were obtained from BIACORE (Uppsala, Sweden). The low carboxylated dextran matrix (B1) was activated with 50 μl at 5 μl/min of a mixture 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. Streptavidin was immobilized with the standard BIACORE protocol at a density of 0.05 pmol/mm2. The biotinylated peptide (0.1 mg/ml in PBS, pH 6.0) was then immobilized on the streptavidin at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 7 min. Kinetic studies were performed as described in Ref. 5Mijares A. Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. The total protein concentration of the purified scFv (active + nonactive proteins) was determined using the BCA kit (Pierce) and by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient was determined using the Expasy protparam tool available on the web (www.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). A431 cells were fixed 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS Triton X-100 0.1% for 1 min. Slides were saturated with PBS supplemented with nonfat dry milk 5%. ScFv 6H8 and scFv 9C2 (9Devaux C. Moreau E. Goyffon M. Rochat H. Billiald P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (control) were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, anti-His tag antibody was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Rabbit anti mouse IgG (H + L) antibody Alexa conjugated (1/200, Molecular Probes, Junction City, OR) was allowed to react with the fixed primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml, Sigma) was used for nuclear staining. cAMP Response by A431 Cells Treated in Vitro with scFv—The biochemical effects of scFv 6H8 on the β2-adrenergic receptor were assessed by measuring the intracellular cAMP concentration of A431 cells (10Delavier-Klutchko C. Hoebeke J. Strosberg A.D. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates 24 h before stimulation and then washed and incubated with 1 ml of Hanks' balanced medium buffered with 10 mm HEPES, containing 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine to block cAMP hydrolysis. After 15 min, scFv was added at different concentrations, and 30 min after the first treatment salbutamol was added to a final concentration of 10 nm. Stimulation of the cells was performed during 15 min, then the supernatant was aspirated and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of boiling water. The cAMP content was determined using a competitive immunoenzymatic assay (BIOTRAK cAMP, Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentrations of the samples were determined using BCA kit (Pierce). The concentration of cAMP was reported on the protein concentration, related to the number of cells/well; the results were expressed as pmol of cAMP/mg of protein. The results were normalized using cAMP content of untreated cells as 100%. Results are from duplicates of three independent experiments. Beating Frequency of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes in Culture—Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared from ventricles of 1–2-day-old Wistar rats using a modified method (11Wallukat G. Wollenberger A. Morwinski R. Pitschner H.F. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured as monolayers for 4 days at 37 °C in SM 20-1 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and 2 mm fluorodeoxyuridine and exhibited a spontaneous basal pulsation rate of about 160 beats/min. The cardiomyocyte cultures were washed with fresh medium containing serum and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the same medium under stationary conditions for 2 h. The flasks were transferred to the heatable stage of an inverted microscope, and the increase of the beating rate was determined for at least 10 observations for each experimental point in three independent experiments. Physiological Characterization of the scFv Fragment on Mice in Vivo—Ten female BALB/c mice, 20 g each, were habituated to tail intravenous injections at the same time as being kept in individual mouse electrocardiogram (ECG) boxes as described in Ref. 12Eftekhari P. Roegel J.C. Lezoualc'h F. Fischmeister R. Imbs J.L. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, for 4 continuous weeks. Six-lead ECGs (DI, DII, DIII, AVL, AVR, AVF) were recorded from 10 conscious mice for 60 min. Mice were not anesthesized to prevent ECG modifications (13Chaves A.A. Dech S.J. Nakayama T. Hamlin R.L. Bauer J.A. Carnes C.A. Life Sci. 2003; 72: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mice were pretreated ip with an injection of 200 μg of the β1-adrenergic antagonist bisoprolol. After 10 min 100 μl of NaCl 0.8% or scFv fragments were injected intravenously at an active concentration of 110 nm. Heart rates were measured by counting QRS peaks in 10 s windows. The cardiac rhythm of scFv-treated mice and NaCl (negative control mice) are compared in a paired match Student's t test. Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab software. To compare percent of variation of the cardiac rhythm with the rhythm at t = 0, we used a Student's t test with fixed mean of 1. A Student's paired match t test was used to compare NaCl injection with scFv 6H8 or control scFv. ScFv 6H8 model was built in silico using the Biopolymer, Homology and Discover software of Accelrys (San Diego, CA). The VH and VL chains of the scFv 6H8 were built from the 1cic (Protein Data Bank) and 1jrh (Protein Data Bank), respectively. The sequences of the templates (Fig. 6) were changed to those of the scFv 6H8, and the modified chain was submitted to a steepest descent energy minimization of 2000 steps until a RMS derivative of 0.001 kcal/mol Å. The assembly was again submitted to a conjugate gradient minimization procedure of 2000 steps with the backbone fixed. Cloning, Sequencing, Expression, and Immunochemical Characterization of the scFv 6H8 Fragment—The N-terminal part of the VH and VL of the 6H8 antibody was sequenced by Edman degradation to design the primers used for the amplification of the two domains. Unfortunately, the VH domain was blocked by a pyroglutamin residue. The sequence of the VL, DIQMTQ, helped us to design the VLRev primer. The scFv-encoding gene derived from the variable regions (VH and VL linked together via a short linker (G4-S)3) of the IgG1 6H8 monoclonal antibody (4Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Mijares A. Granier C. Argibay J. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 348: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with addition of a C-terminal His6 tag encoding sequence, was inserted in frame with the PelB sequence into the pSW1 expression vector. The sequence of the single chain construction is represented in Fig. 1. We confirmed that the cloned VL gene did not correspond to the aberrant kappa transcript of the sp20 hybridomas (14Carroll W.L. Mendel E. Levy S. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSW1-scFv 6H8 was cloned into the HB2151 Escherichia coli strain, and the recombinant protein was expressed and exported to the bacterial periplasm by its leader sequence PelB (15Lei S.P. Lin H.C. Wang S.S. Callaway J. Wilcox G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4379-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The scFv 6H8 was easily purified and concentrated by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Immunochemical characterization of scFv 6H8. a, purification of the scFv 6H8 by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. GE correspond to a SDS-PAGE electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue and WB to the Western blot (see “Experimental Procedures”) of the periplasmic extract (P.E.), the flow-through (F.T.), and the elution (E.) of the purified scFv protein. b, immunocytochemistry on A431 cells expressing at their surface the β2-adrenergic receptor. The left panel shows a nuclear 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole labeling and the right panel an immune labeling of the same cells. A specific membranar and vesicular fluorescence at the membrane of the cells incubated with the scFv 6H8 can be seen (I). A nonspecific nuclear labeling can be seen with the scFv 6H8 (I), scFv control (II), or anti-histidine tag alone (III). The nuclear background noise is mainly due to a nonspecific binding of the anti histidine tag antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) BIACORE technology allows the analysis of scFv/antigenic peptide interaction in real time. It also allows the determination of the active concentration of analytes in solution (16Richalet-Secordel P.M. Rauffer-Bruyere N. Christensen L.L. Ofenloch-Haehnle B. Seidel C. Van Regenmortel M.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The active concentration showed that only 5% of the purified recombinant protein was able to interact with the antigenic peptide H19C; this is mainly due to the bacterial expression system that has limited capacity to correctly fold the polypeptidic chain and to the natural instability of this chimeric construct (see Ref. 17Worn A. Pluckthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 989-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar for review). The calculated concentration allowed us to determine the kinetic parameters of the scFv 6H8 using a BIACORE system and the BIAeval 3.1 software. A Langmuir binding model gave us the following kinetic parameters: the k on = 1.0 × 105m–1 s–1, the k off = 4.8 × 10–3 s–1, and the equilibrium constant KA = 2.1 × 108m–1. These parameters are similar to those calculated under the same conditions for the 6H8 proteolytic Fab fragment (k on = 0.89 × 106m–1 s–1, k off = 6.93 × 10–3 s–1) (5Mijares A. Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To assess the ability of the scFv to interact with the receptor, immunocytochemical experiments were performed on A431 cells that express at their surface the β2-adrenergic receptor. Fig. 2b shows the presence of a specific vesicular and membrane labeling when using the scFv 6H8 fragment. Pharmacological Characterization of the scFv Fragment—We next determined whether the scFv construction had pharmacological properties on the β2-adrenergic receptors. A431 cells stimulated with salbutamol (10 nm) were treated with different scFv concentrations. Fig. 3 shows that scFv 6H8 was able to inhibit the activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, it was able to significantly decrease the basal accumulation of cAMP. This is the main characteristic of inverse agonists (see Ref. 18Daeffler L. Landry Y. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 2000; 14: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar for review). These results were confirmed in vitro by measuring the beating rate of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes stimulated by clenbuterol (a specific β2-agonist) (Fig. 4). The basal beating rate of the cardiomyocytes as well as the clenbuterol dose-response curve were decreased. In view of the fact that the clenbuterol dose-response curve was not shifted to the right but only showed a decrease in the maximal response, we conclude that the scFv acts in a noncompetitive manner.Fig. 4Pharmacological effects of scFv 6H8 on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in vitro. The increase in beat number/min is represented upon increasing concentration of clenbuterol in presence of scFv 6H8, scFv 9C2 (control), or without co-treatment. scFv 6H8 (5 nm) decreases spontaneous beating rate (left upper panel) and inhibits the clenbuterol stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in a noncompetitive manner.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Physiological Characterization of the scFv Fragment—To investigate the possible in vivo effects of scFv on the heart, we injected the scFv construction in mice. Before scFv injection, mice were pretreated for 10 min with bisoprolol hemifumarate (a specific β1-antagonist) to limit the regulatory activity of the β1-adrenergic receptor on the heart. Intravenous injection of 100 μl of 110 nm active scFv gave a statistically significant decrease of the beating rate (about 14%), 2 min after the injection (Fig. 5). NaCl or control scFv did not significantly alter the beating rate. The scFv control was injected at the same protein concentration as the 6H8 scFv. The intravenous injection of the inverse agonist ICI 118,551 at 10 mg/kg decreased the beating rate to a larger extent (26%). G protein-coupled receptors are one of the main targets of cardiovascular and neurological drugs, since most of the neurotransmitter receptors belong to this family. The pharmacological existence of subfamilies of these receptors was first assessed by showing that the same neurotransmitters had different effects on different tissues. The molecular basis of this diversity was confirmed by cloning, sequencing, and expressing molecules coded by different genes but recognizing the same neurotransmitters. The putative structure of these proteins suggests that the neurotransmitters are localized in an intramembrane pocket, which only allows a limited amount of variability to embed different agonist and antagonists. The difficulty to synthesize molecules with an exquisite specificity for one of the receptor subtypes could be explained by the constancy of the pharmacophore pocket belonging to members of the same family. In contrast, the extracellular domains of receptors of the same family can vary more widely, which suggests the possibility to raise antibodies possessing the exquisite specificity sought for by the pharmacologists. Drug discovery based on immunological reagents was already forwarded more than 20 years ago, but only recently, due to the expansion of biotechnological tools, could it be considered as a realistic goal. Indeed, recent results have shown that such approach could lead to functional peptides derived from antibodies directed against cell receptors (19Bes C. Cerutti M. Briant-Longuet L. Bresson D. Peraldi-Roux S. Pugniere M. Mani J.C. Pau B. Devaux C. Granier C. Devauchelle G. Chardes T. Hum. Antibodies. 2001; 10: 67-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wijkhuisen A. Tymciu S. Fischer J. Alexandrenne C. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Boquet D. Conrath M. Couraud J.Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 468: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The finding that autoantibodies against G protein-coupled receptors were present in and responsible for different cardiovascular diseases prompted us to use a similar approach for the development of antibody fragments of low molecular weight interfering with this family of receptors. Cloning and sequencing of the variable regions of the 6H8 monoclonal antibody in comparison with the corresponding germ line showed 19.4 and 52.6% variability respectively for the heavy chain and for the light chain. The sequence of the variable part of the heavy chain corresponded for 84% to that of the Protein Data Bank access number 1cic (Fab/anti Fab complex) (21Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Riottot M.M. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), while the sequence of the light chain corresponded to 90% of that of the Protein Data Bank access number 1jrh (Fab anti Nter part of the interferon-γ receptor) (22Sogabe S. Stuart F. Henke C. Bridges A. Williams G. Birch A. Winkler F.K. Robinson J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 882-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The high similarity of the scFv fragment with antibody combining sites of the known three-dimensional structure allowed us to construct a realistic model of the scFv fragment in silico. Ten amino acids of the CDR of the scFv 6H8 are different from the sequence of the Protein Data Bank templates (Fig. 6). These amino acids seem to form a small groove at the VH-VL interface in this flat paratope where the essential epitopic Trp-173 of the H19C peptide or the second extracellular loop of the β2-adrenergic receptor could fit in. The physicochemical parameters of the epitope-scFv interaction as measured by the BIACORE system allowed us to confirm that the scFv fragment had similar binding properties as the Fab fragment of the 6H8 antibody. The amount of actively binding scFv fragments was, however, only 5% of the total purified amount of protein. The total amount of purified scFv was determined using a BCA kit and absorbance reading at 280 nm. The measured and calculated extinction coefficients are quite similar (respectively, 1.964 and 2.123), which indicates that the measured protein concentration corresponds to the scFv. The active concentration of scFv was taken into account to study the pharmacological and physiological properties of the scFv fragments. Cytochemistry experiment showed a specific labeling of membrane, membrane invagination, and cytoplasmic vesicles of the β2-adrenergic receptor as described in Ref. 23Raposo G. Dunia I. Delavier-Klutchko C. Kaveri S. Strosberg A.D. Benedetti E.L. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 340-352PubMed Google Scholar. This distribution corresponded to diffuse membrane receptors, activated receptors concentrated in invaginations, and submembranar vesicles and new synthesized receptors transported by cytoplasmic vesicles toward the membrane. The Fab fragments of the antibody were shown to block the activation of L-type Ca2+ channels by the β2-selective agonist clenbuterol, suggesting that the combining site-receptor complex blocked Gs protein coupling, adenyl cyclase activation, and protein kinase A phosphorylation, the normal biochemical cascade induced by β-agonists. To directly check the mechanism of blocking, we studied the accumulation of cAMP in A431 cells, which have been shown to possess a large amount of β2-adrenergic receptors (10Delavier-Klutchko C. Hoebeke J. Strosberg A.D. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The scFv fragments indeed blocked the cAMP accumulation induced by the β2-agonist salbutamol, but moreover they blocked the basal cAMP accumulation in the cells, ascribed to the existence of spontaneous active receptors (24Zhou Y.Y. Song L.S. Lakatta E.G. Xiao R.P. Cheng H. J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This means that the scFv fragments behave as inverse agonists, i.e. molecules specifically recognizing the resting conformation of the receptor and shifting the active → resting conformational equilibrium to the right. We functionally confirmed the inverse agonist properties of the scFv fragment both in vitro and in vivo. The scFv fragment was able to decrease the spontaneous beating rate of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in culture. It also blocked the effect on the same cells of the β2-agonist clenbuterol. This effect did not shift the clenbuterol dose-response curve to higher agonist concentrations but decreased the maximal obtained response. These results suggest that the scFv fragment blocks the accessibility of the pharmacophore pocket in a noncompetitive manner. A conformational change induced by the scFv on the extracellular loop could thus close the pharmacophore pocket for the agonist. The scFv was also able to decrease the beating frequency in vivo of the heart of conscious mice pretreated with the β1-agonist bisoprolol. Although the decrease only stayed for 4 min, probably due to the rapid filtration of the scFv by the kidneys (25Evans M.J. Rollins S.A. Wolff D.W. Rother R.P. Norin A.J. Therrien D.M. Grijalva G.A.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6363-6371PubMed Google Scholar), it was similar to that observed by the β2-specific inverse agonist ICI 118,551, physiologically confirming its biochemical inverse agonist activity. Recently it was shown that the inverse agonist ICI 118,551 could induce a conformation with high affinity for the Gi protein (28Gong H. Sun H. Koch W.J. Rau T. Eschenhagen T. Ravens U. Heubach J.F. Adamson D.L. Harding S.E. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2497-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The decrease in beating frequency could thus not only be explained by closing of the pharmacophore pocket by the scFv but also by induction of the same receptor conformation as that induced by ICI 118,551. It must, however, be noted that the low amount of scFv injected must supersede the endogenous catecholamine concentration to exert its physiological effects, explaining the low and transient response. To summarize, we have completely characterized a polypeptide with a specific inverse agonist activity on the β2-adrenergic receptor. It is the first example of a G protein-coupled receptor inverse agonist, shifting by an allosteric mechanism the receptor to its resting conformation. The structural model that we obtained from the scFv fragment could help us to synthesize shorter peptide fragments, which could share the same properties."
https://openalex.org/W1972072413,"We investigated effects of pro-atherogenic oxidized lipoproteins on phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthesis in murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12). Cells surface-bound, internalized, and degraded oxidized low density lipoproteins (Ox-LDL). Ox-LDL significantly reduced [3H]choline incorporation into PtdCho in cells by selectively inhibiting the activity of the rate-regulatory enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytdylyltransferase (CCT). Ox-LDL coordinately increased the cellular turnover of CCTα protein as determined by [35S]methionine pulse-chase studies by inducing the calcium-activated proteinase, calpain. Forced expression of calpain or exposure of cells to the calcium ionophore, A23187, increased CCTα degradation, whereas overexpression of the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, attenuated Ox-LDL-induced CCTα degradation. The effects of Ox-LDL on CCTα breakdown were attenuated in calpain-deficient cells. In vitro calpain digestion of CCTα isolated from cells transfected with truncated or internal deletion mutants indicated multiple cleavage sites within the CCTα primary structure, leading to the generation of a 26-kDa (p26) fragment. Calpain hydrolysis of purified CCTα generated p26, which upon NH2-terminal sequencing localized a calpain attack site within the CCTα amino terminus. Expression of a CCTα mutant where the amino-terminal cleavage site and a putative carboxyl-terminal hydrolysis region were modified resulted in an enzyme that was significantly less sensitive to proteolytic cleavage and restored the ability of cells to synthesize surfactant PtdCho after Ox-LDL treatment. Thus, these results provide a critical link between proatherogenic lipoproteins and their metabolic target, CCTα, resulting in impaired surfactant metabolism. We investigated effects of pro-atherogenic oxidized lipoproteins on phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthesis in murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-12). Cells surface-bound, internalized, and degraded oxidized low density lipoproteins (Ox-LDL). Ox-LDL significantly reduced [3H]choline incorporation into PtdCho in cells by selectively inhibiting the activity of the rate-regulatory enzyme, CTP:phosphocholine cytdylyltransferase (CCT). Ox-LDL coordinately increased the cellular turnover of CCTα protein as determined by [35S]methionine pulse-chase studies by inducing the calcium-activated proteinase, calpain. Forced expression of calpain or exposure of cells to the calcium ionophore, A23187, increased CCTα degradation, whereas overexpression of the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, attenuated Ox-LDL-induced CCTα degradation. The effects of Ox-LDL on CCTα breakdown were attenuated in calpain-deficient cells. In vitro calpain digestion of CCTα isolated from cells transfected with truncated or internal deletion mutants indicated multiple cleavage sites within the CCTα primary structure, leading to the generation of a 26-kDa (p26) fragment. Calpain hydrolysis of purified CCTα generated p26, which upon NH2-terminal sequencing localized a calpain attack site within the CCTα amino terminus. Expression of a CCTα mutant where the amino-terminal cleavage site and a putative carboxyl-terminal hydrolysis region were modified resulted in an enzyme that was significantly less sensitive to proteolytic cleavage and restored the ability of cells to synthesize surfactant PtdCho after Ox-LDL treatment. Thus, these results provide a critical link between proatherogenic lipoproteins and their metabolic target, CCTα, resulting in impaired surfactant metabolism. Phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) 1The abbreviations used are: PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; CCT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; LDL, low density lipoprotein; Ox-LDL, oxidized low density lipoproteins; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; Ox-VLDL, oxidized very low density lipoproteins; LPDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum; MLE-12, murine lung epithelia; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CDP-choline, cytidine diphosphocholine; DSPtd-Cho, disaturated phosphatidylcholine; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO; LysoPtdCho, lysophosphatidylcholine; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ion mass spectrometry; CMV, cytomegalovirus. has diverse biologic roles in mammalian cells and serves as the major phospholipid of pulmonary alveolar surfactant. Surfactant is synthesized and secreted from alveolar type II epithelial cells in a lipoproteinaceous form highly enriched with disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPtdCho), a critical surface-active component (1Rooney S.A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 131: 439-460PubMed Google Scholar). DSPtdCho biosynthesis requires the uptake of choline into alveolar type II epithelial cells with the subsequent entry of this metabolite into the CDP-choline pathway (2Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A key step in this pathway involves the conversion of cholinephosphate to CDP-choline, which is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) (EC 2.7.7.15 (2Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)). CCT is an amphitropic enzyme, thus exhibiting interconversion between its soluble and membrane-associated forms. Accordingly, CCT localizes to several intracellular organelles, most notably the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum (3Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ridsdale R. Tseu I. Wang J. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49148-49155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CCT activity is largely controlled by association with membrane lipids, and lipid regulation is well documented (2Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For example, anionic phospholipids, diacylglycerol, and unsaturated fatty acids all have been shown to potently activate the enzyme in vitro (5Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Pelech S.L. Pritchard P.H. Brindley D.N. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1978; 253: 4980-4986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CCT is also a phosphoenzyme, and membrane activation of CCT is influenced by enzyme phosphorylation status (5Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, CCT is controlled at the level of gene transcription and by altered mRNA and protein stability (8Bakovic M. Waite K. Tang W. Tabas I. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Tessner T.G. Rock C.O. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43688-43692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Three CCT isoforms exist in cells: CCTα, CCTβ1, and CCTβ2 (13Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). CCTα, the predominant species in alveolar epithelia contains four distinct functional domains including an amino-terminal nuclear localization domain, a mid-portion catalytic sequence, a lipid-binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation domain. A second lipid-interacting domain within the carboxyl terminus of CCTα has been identified recently (14Lykidis A. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 494-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All CCT isoforms are catalytically active and are regulated by the availability of exogenous lipids. Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that circulating native lipoproteins provide an important source of regulatory lipids for CCT activation and surfactant PtdCho synthesis (15Mallampalli R.K. Salome R.G. Bowen S.L. Chappell D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Ryan A.J. Medh J D. McCoy D.M. Salome R.G. Mallampalli R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L310-L318Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) stimulate CCT activity and DSPtdCho synthesis in vivo (16Ryan A.J. Medh J D. McCoy D.M. Salome R.G. Mallampalli R.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L310-L318Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, all lipoproteins deteriorate through an oxidative process, and lipoprotein oxidation is of central importance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic heart disease (17Jialal I. Devaraj S. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Low density lipoproteins (LDL) oxidize in the arterial intima in the presence of transition metals, thereby stimulating leukocyte-endothelial adhesion and recruitment of macrophages via chemoattractants. Severely oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) is no longer recognized by the classic LDL receptor pathway, which is subject to feedback inhibition by intracellular cholesterol content but is taken up by macrophages via scavenger receptors. This in turn leads to the generation of the foam cell and the evolution of the fatty streak, hallmarks of atherosclerosis. Oxidized lipoproteins also appear to participate in the pathogenesis of several lung disorders such as asthma, acute lung injury, and cystic fibrosis (18Schunemann H.J. Muti P. Freudenheim J.L. Armstrong D. Browne R. Klocke R.A. Trevisan M. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1997; 146: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Many of these disorders are characterized by decreased levels of surfactant PtdCho (19Jobe A.H. Ikegami M. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 489-495PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in acute lung injury there is leakage of native lipoproteins from serum into the alveolar space (20Emmett M. Fowler A.A. Hyers T.M. Crowle A.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1987; 184: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These native lipoproteins are modified by an oxidative stress, intrinsic to lung injury, resulting from impaired antioxidant defenses, the presence of reactive oxidant species, and exposure to hyperoxia during mechanical ventilation (20Emmett M. Fowler A.A. Hyers T.M. Crowle A.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1987; 184: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, pulmonary oxidative modification of native lipoproteins may be a critical event leading to altered surfactant lipid composition. Interestingly, alveolar type II epithelial cells express scavenger receptors that mediate uptake of antioxidants (21Kolleck I. Schlame M. Fechner H. Looman A.C. Wissel H. Rustow B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 882-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations led us to hypothesize that Ox-LDL catabolism by alveolar epithelia might down-regulate surfactant DSPtdCho biosynthesis. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of oxidized lipoproteins on a key regulatory step within the CDP-choline pathway. We observed that these modified lipoproteins inhibit PtdCho synthesis in alveolar epithelia by triggering CCTα degradation via calpain-mediated cleavage of the enzyme. Materials—VLDL and LDL were purchased from Intracel (Frederick, MD). Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) (d > 1.21 g/ml) was isolated by ultracentrifugation (22Chappell D.A. Fry G.L.

Lipoprotein Oxidation—Lipoproteins were oxidized by dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μm CuSO4 for24hat37 °C (27Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar). Confirmation of lipoprotein oxidization was by the malonaldehyde assay and by apoprotein B-100 immunoblotting. Cell Isolation and Culture—Primary rat type II epithelial cells were isolated as described (28Longo C.A. Tyler D. Mallampalli R.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% LPDS for up to 24 h. MLE cells were cultured in Hite's medium containing LPDS for up to 48 h with or without LDL (100 μg/ml), Ox-LDL (10–100 μg/ml), or Ox-VLDL (10–100 μg/ml) (29Balibrea-Cantero J.L. Arias-Diaz J. Garcia C. Torres-Melero J. Simon C. Rodriguez J.M. Vara E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In some studies, cells were preincubated with lactacystin (5 μm) or ALLN (40 μg/ml) for 1 h prior to exposure of cells to Ox-LDL. Cells lysates were isolated after brief sonication in Buffer A (10Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9699-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) at 4 °C prior to analysis. Cell Surface Binding, Internalization, and Degradation of Oxidized Lipoproteins—Cellular catabolism of lipoproteins was determined as described (15Mallampalli R.K. Salome R.G. Bowen S.L. Chappell D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2020-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

PtdCho and DSPtdCho Analysis—Cells were pulsed with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]choline chloride during the final 2 h of incubation with or without lipoproteins. Total cellular lipids were extracted (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43088) Google Scholar) and spotted on LK5D plates, and PtdCho was resolved using thin layer chromatography (10Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9699-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DSPtdCho determination was as described (31Mallampalli R.K. Salome R.G. Spector A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L641—L648Google Scholar). Enzyme Assays—CCT activity was determined by measuring the rate of incorporation of [methyl-14C] phosphocholine into CDP-choline using a charcoal extraction method (32Mallampalli R.K. Mathur S.N. Warnock L.J. Salome R.G. Hunninghake G.W. Field F.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Equal amounts of total protein from cell lysates, adjusted to give a final concentration of 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, were heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoreactive CCTα and calpain were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system. The dilution factors for all polyclonal antibodies were 1:1000. [35S]Methionine Pulse-Chase and CCTα Immunoprecipitation— Turnover of CCTα was determined by preincubating MLE cells for 1 h in methionine-deficient medium and then pulsing with [35S]methionine (60 μCi/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C (10Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9699-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed twice in a similar medium and chased with serum-free Hite's medium containing 10 mm methionine and 3 mm cysteine for 0–24 h, with or without Ox-LDL. Cells were harvested and CCTα immunoprecipitated using the CCTα polyclonal antibody prior to separation using SDS-PAGE (10Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9699-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cloning of Rat CCTα—Total cellular RNA was isolated from primary rat adult type II alveolar epithelial cells using Tri-Reagent per the manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded cDNA was generated from RNA using the SMART™ cDNA library construction kit following the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA encoding the open reading frame for CCTα was generated using double-stranded cDNA as a template and using the sense primer 5′-agatctatggatgcacagagttcag-3′ and antisense primer 5′-tctagattagtcctcttcatcctcgctg-3′ in a two-step PCR amplification using Advantage cDNA polymerase. The reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 3 min, 18 cycles. The ∼1100-bp CCTα open reading frame was purified using the Geneclean2 kit and cloned into pCR4-TOPO, and plasmid minipreps were verified by sequencing. This clone was then digested by BgIII and XbaI, purified by Geneclean2, and ligated into a pCMV5 expression vector previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. Construction of CCTα Mutants—An internal deletion CCTα mutant (termed CCTα289), lacking the putative membrane-binding domain of CCTα (amino acid residues 240–290), was generated as follows. pCMV5-CCTα was used as a template for PCR using the sense primer 5′-ggagctcaatgtcagctttatcaacagtcccaagcacagtccc-3′ and antisense primer 5′-tctagattagtcctcttcatcctcgctg-3′ to generate a 230-bp fragment that was purified and directionally cloned into pCR4-TOPO for transformation into TOP10-competent cells. pCMV5-CCTα was digested by SacI and XbaI, whereas pCR4-TOPO-CCTα was digested by BglII and SacI, generating 234- and 687-bp fragments, respectively. These products were purified and ligated into the BglII/XbaI site in pCMV5 using T4 ligase at 15 °C overnight. An amino-terminal CCTα mutant (CCTαSM), in which Ser5-Ser6 were mutated to Met5-Met6, was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-ctatggatgc acagatgatg gctaaagtca attcaagg-3′ (sense) and 5′-ccttgaattg actttagcca tcatctgtgc atccatag-3′ (antisense), and pCMV5-CCT plasmid DNA was used as a template. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 6 min. We also generated a CCTα protein, termed CCTαPenta, that harbored the amino-terminal mutation above but also had residues Lys238-Lys239-Tyr240 mutated to Arg238-Arg239-Phe240, using procedures similar to those described above. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-gct tta tca acg aaa gga gat tcc act tgc aag aac g-3′ (sense) and 5′-cgt tct tgc aag tgg aat ctc ctt tcg ttg ata aag c-3′ (antisense), with CCTαSM plasmid DNA used as a template. The CCTαPenta construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Construction of Histidine-tagged CCTα and CCTα 289 Expression Vectors—Carboxyl-terminal histidine-tagged full-length CCTα and the deletion mutant CCTα289 vectors were generated by PCR using pCMV5-CCTα or pCMV5-CCTα289 as templates with the sense primer 5′-agatctatggatgcacagagttcag-3′ and antisense primer 5-′tctagatcaatgatgatgatgatgatggtcctcttcatcctcgc-3′. The resulting ∼1100- and ∼900-bp PCR products first were cloned into pCR4-TOPO and then ligated into the BglII and XbaI sites of pCMV5. The pCMV5-CCTα-His and pCMV5-CCTα289-His were verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of Recombinant pCMV5-CCTα-His and CCTα 289-His Proteins—The pCMV5-CCTα-His and CCTα289-His plasmids were transiently transfected into CHO cells. After 24 h, cell lysates were harvested using the M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent. CCTα-histidine tag proteins were purified using the B-PER 6XHis spin purification kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Construction of M-calpain by Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis of the M-calpain expression vector (pOP13-JHMS (25Huang J. Forsberg N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12100-12105Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)) was performed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and the primers 5′-ggagcccttggggactgctggcttctggct-3′ and 5′-agccagaagccagcagtccccaagggctcc-3′. The PCR conditions were: 95 °C for 30 s, 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 9 min. The resulting pOP13-calpain was verified by DNA sequencing. Real-time PCR Analysis—Total cellular RNA from MLE cells was obtained using Tri-Reagent. Taqman reverse transcription reagents were used to generate cDNA from cellular RNA. Real-time PCR was then performed on cDNA using the Applied Biosystems 7700 real-time PCR instrument and the SYBR Green PCR master mix. M-calpain mRNA detection primers were: 5′ primer, 5′-caagtcatcgttgcccgg-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-ccaaacaccgcacaaaattg-3′. The μ-calpain 5′ primer was 5′-tcacccgctactcggagc-3′, and 3′ primer was 5′-cgcacaagacagcacacaaa-3′. Taqman rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) control reagents were used as the internal control. Standard curves generated for calpain and compared with GAPDH using serial dilutions of mRNA were found to be linear from 0.08 ng to 50 ng RNA in the reaction mixture. This range included effective concentrations used in experiments. Transient Transfection and Over-expression of Recombinant Proteins—Transfections were conducted for 120 min in 0% fetal bovine serum medium using 10 μl of FuGENE 6™ reagent and 5 μg/dish of the desired plasmid. Immediately after transfections, cells were transferred to medium containing 2–10% fetal bovine serum and allowed to recover for 24 h before cell lysates were harvested for analysis. In other studies, cells were transfected with pOP13-JHCPIS (calpastatin inhibitory domain fragment) with or without Ox-LDL (100 μg/ml) for 48 h or with pOP13-calpain. In Vitro Digestion of CCTα—Digestions were conducted at 35 °C for 20 min in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 25 μg of purified rat CCTα-His and 0.7 μg of recombinant rat M-calpain in calpain buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Tween 20, and 0.015% Triton X-100). The reaction was started by adding CaCl2 to a final concentration of 3 mm and was terminated by adding 10 mm EDTA and then heating the samples to 95 °C. After digested proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, they were transferred to Problot membranes for Coomassie Blue staining and submitted to NH2-terminal sequencing or processed for immunoblotting. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni adjustment or Student's unpaired t test (33Rosner B.A. Fundamentals of Biostatistics. Wadsworth Publishing Co., Belmont, CA1995: 314-318Google Scholar). Oxidized Lipoprotein Catabolism by Alveolar Epithelia— MLE cells bound, internalized, and degraded 125I-labeled oxidized human LDL and oxidized VLDL. Cells exhibited a nearly 8-, 4-, and 6-fold increase in steady-state uptake, internalization, and degradation of 125I-Ox-LDL ligand, respectively (Fig. 1). Ox-LDL catabolism increased steadily up to concentrations of ∼25 μg/ml ligand, thereafter reaching a plateau at higher doses indicative of saturable kinetics (Fig. 1). Cells also exhibited a dose-dependent increase in catabolism of Ox-VLDL; however, saturability was not always observed within the range of lipoproteins tested in these studies (Fig. 1, insets). In preliminary studies, primary rat alveolar type II epithelial cells also bound and internalized oxidized lipoproteins (data not shown). Thus, alveolar epithelia actively engage in modified lipoprotein catabolism. Ox-LDL Inhibits Surfactant PtdCho Biosynthesis—Ox-LDL significantly decreased the incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline into PtdCho and DSPtdCho in primary type II epithelia and MLE cells. In primary cells, Ox-LDL significantly decreased choline incorporation into PtdCho by ∼40% after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 2A). Similar effects of Ox-LDL were observed on choline incorporation into DSPtdCho, the primary surface-active component of surfactant, which was reduced by 46% versus control (Fig 2A, inset). In MLE cells, the effects of Ox-LDL were more pronounced, as Ox-LDL inhibited choline incorporation into PtdCho and DSPtdCho by 75 and 67%, respectively (Fig. 2B and inset). To further investigate the effects of Ox-LDL on DSPtdCho synthesis, we assayed enzymes within the CDP-choline pathway. Ox-LDL produced a 43% decrease in CCT activity in primary cells (Fig. 2C) and a dose-dependent decrease in CCT activity in MLE cells (Fig. 2C, inset; n = 3, p < 0.05 versus control). In contrast, these particles tended to increase cholinephosphosphotransferase activity but did not alter choline kinase activity in primary cells (data not shown). Thus, Ox-LDL substantially reduces surfactant lipid biosynthesis by selectively inhibiting the rate-regulatory step within the CDP-choline pathway. Ox-LDL Increases CCTα Protein Turnover—Ox-LDL produced a dose-dependent decrease in the steady-state levels of the 42-kDa native CCTα protein after 48 h of exposure without having any effect on β-actin (Fig. 3, A and B). Similar effects on CCTα levels were seen after Ox-VLDL treatment of MLE cells (Fig. 3C) and in primary alveolar cells (Fig. 3D). These data suggest that Ox-LDL decreases PtdCho synthesis by increasing CCTα protein degradation. Confirmation of Ox-LDL effects on enzyme turnover was made using [35S]methionine pulse-chase studies. The amount of [35S]methionine incorporated into immunoprecipitable CCTα was determined after a 4-h pulse followed by a 0–24-h chase with unlabeled methionine conducted in the presence or absence of Ox-LDL. The amount of [35S]methionine incorporated into immunoprecipitable CCTα was decreased at 6 h by Ox-LDL (Fig. 3E), and by 18–24 h substantially less CCTα was observed in Ox-LDL-treated cells compared with control. Effects of Ox-LDL on CCTα Expression Are Mediated by Calpain—Cells were preincubated with ALLN and lactacystin, calpain, and 20 S proteasome inhibitors, respectively, and samples were analyzed for CCTα protein content and activity (Fig. 4, A and B). Pretreatment with either ALLN or lactacystin partly blocked Ox-LDL-induced CCTα degradation (Fig. 4A). The effects of ALLN were generally greater than lactacystin in antagonizing Ox-LDL on CCTα protein levels, although both inhibitors were equally effective in attenuating the lipoprotein-induced inhibition of CCT activity (Fig. 4, A and B). To investigate calcium-activated proteinases on CCTα degradation, cells were exposed to A23187, which stimulates calpain activity. Similar to Ox-LDL, the ionophore A23187 induced CCTα degradation (Fig. 4C). Calpain-mediated proteolysis in cells is tightly regulated by the availability of its endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin. When MLE cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding a calpastatin inhibitory domain fragment, the effects of Ox-LDL on CCTα degradation were reduced compared with cells transfected with a control plasmid (Fig. 4D). Further, overexpression of calpain in MLE cells induced CCTα degradation similar to calcium ionophore (Fig."

Moreover, two vHNF1 isoforms generated by alternative splicing are present in all tissues expressing this gene. vHnf1-deficient mouse embryos die soon after implantation due to defective visceral endoderm formation, an extraembryonic tissue essential for development and survival of the embryo proper. In contrast, invalidation of Hnf1, which is expressed at later developmental stages than vHnf1, does not lead to embryonic lethality or developmental defects. To examine the specific or potential equivalent functions of vHNF1 isoforms and HNF1 during the process of visceral endoderm differentiation, we stably reexpressed these factors in vHnf1-deficient embryonic stem cells. Analysis of these embryonic stem cells upon differentiation into embryoid bodies shows that vHNF1 isoforms exhibit specific behaviors depending on particular target genes and cooperate in the establishment of a functional visceral endoderm. Furthermore, forced expression of HNF1 in vHnf1-deficient embryonic stem cells fully restores the formation of a mature visceral endoderm with the correct expression profile of early and late markers of this lineage. Thus, in this context, HNF1 functionally replaces both vHNF1 isoforms, suggesting that the different developmental functions of these transcription factors are mainly due to the acquisition of novel expression patterns.

Thus, in this context, HNF1 functionally replaces both vHNF1 isoforms, suggesting that the different developmental functions of these transcription factors are mainly due to the acquisition of novel expression patterns. Duplication of developmental control genes is thought to be an evolutionary mechanism for the generation of novel functions allowing for increased diversity in complex organisms. Acquisition of new functions principally involves the evolution of cis-regulatory sequences, although coding sequences have also evolved, albeit at significantly lower levels (1Force A. Lynch M. Pickett F.B. Amores A. Yan Y.L. Postlethwait J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1531-1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1α and Tcf-1) and variant HNF1 (vHNF1, HNF-1β, and Tcf-2) have arisen by duplication of an ancestral gene at the onset of vertebrate evolution. They belong to a distinct subclass of the homeobox transcription factor family characterized by a highly conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain and a more divergent C-terminal transactivation domain. The DNA binding domain is composed of three conserved regions: the N-terminal dimerization domain, an atypical POU-specific (POUs) 1The abbreviations used are: POUs, POU-specific domain; POUH, POU homeodomain; VE, visceral endoderm; ES, embryonic stem; EB, embryoid bodies; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; GAPDH, glyceralde-hyde phosphate dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase. domain and a divergent POU homeodomain (POUH), containing a loop of 21 amino acids between helices 2 and 3. The POUs and POUH domains are required for sequence specificity and DNA recognition (2Tomei L. Cortese R. De Francesco R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4119-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent three-dimensional structure analysis indicates that the POUs domain interacts with the atypical insertion of the homeodomain to create a stable interface, further distinguishing HNF1/vHNF1 from other flexible POU-homeodomain factors (3Chi Y. Frantz J. Hansen L. Dhe-Paganon S. Shoelson S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 10: 1129-1137Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because of these particular structural features, HNF1 and vHNF1 bind DNA as dimers or heterodimers and display indistinguishable DNA-binding sequence specificity (4Rey-Campos J. Chouard T. Yaniv M. Cereghini S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 5De Simone V. De Magistris L. Lazzaro D. Gerstner J. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Cortese R.

HNF1 is however a more powerful activator than vHNF1, implying that these two factors display distinct regulatory properties in vivo (4Rey-Campos J. Chouard T. Yaniv M. Cereghini S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 8Ringeisen F. Rey-Campos J. Yaniv M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25706-25711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). vHNF1 and HNF1 are co-expressed in the yolk sac endoderm and in developing liver, kidney, and pancreas, although with different spatio-temporal patterns (9Lazzaro D. De Simone V. De Magistris L. Lehtonen E. Cortese R. Development. 1992; 114: 469-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ott M.O. Rey-Campos J. Cereghini S. Yaniv M. Mech.

Dev. 1999; 89: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Transcription of the vHnf1 gene precedes that of HNF1 starting from the earliest stages of differentiation of these organs. HNF1 appears later, during the maturation stages. Notably, vHnf1 is uniquely expressed in the primitive and visceral endoderm from embryonic day 4.5 to 7.5 and in the liver, pancreatic, and ureteric buds at embryonic days 9.5–11 (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HNF1 appears in the visceral endoderm of the yolk sac around embryonic day 8.5 and in the liver and pancreatic buds at embryonic day 10.5, after specification of these organs from the gut endoderm (11Cereghini S. Ott M.O. Power S. Maury M. Development. 1992; 116: 783-797PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nammo T. Yamagata K. Hamaoka R. Zhu Q. Akiyama T. Gonzalez F. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1142-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, vHnf1 is expressed in the forming neural tube, the lungs, and the genital tract, where HNF1 is absent (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Coffinier C. Barra J. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Reber M. Cereghini S. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with these embryonic expression patterns, vHnf1-deficient mouse embryos die shortly after implantation due to defective visceral endoderm (VE) formation (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Coffinier C. Thepot D. Babinet C. Yaniv M. Barra J. Development. 1999; 126: 4785-4794PubMed Google Scholar). The VE is an extraembryonic tissue, source of nutrients and multiple signals essential for normal development of the pregastrulating mouse embryo. In addition to its nutritional and histotrophic role, the VE participates in other embryonic developmental processes including early anterior neural patterning (17Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 277-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), cavitation of the ectoderm (18Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Development. 1999; 126: 535-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and specification of hematopoietic and endothelial cell fates (19Belaoussoff M. Farrington S.M. Baron M.H. Development. 1998; 125: 5009-5018PubMed Google Scholar). vHnf1 homozygous mutant embryos lack a distinct extraembryonic VE and as a consequence the ectodermal cells are severely disorganized. In contrast, HNF1 is not required for normal development, although Hnf1-deficient mice die during postnatal life because of hepatic, pancreatic and renal dysfunction (20Pontoglio M. Barra J.

Bonner-Weir S. Bell G.I. Yaniv M. Polonsky K.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2215-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The sequential expression of vHNF1 and HNF1 in diverse tissues, along with their structural similarities, raise the question of whether the distinct function of these factors is defined by their different spatiotemporal expression patterns or by their intrinsic biochemical activities. An additional level of complexity in elucidating the precise function of these factors comes from the existence of different isoforms generated by either constitutive or regulated alternative splicing. Whereas in mice, transcription of the Hnf1 gene generates only one major transcript, two isoforms of vHNF1 designated vHNF1-A and -B, resulting from alternative exon usage, are always present, albeit at different levels, in all tissues where vHnf1 is expressed (8Ringeisen F. Rey-Campos J. Yaniv M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25706-25711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cereghini S. Ott M.O. Power S. Maury M. Development. 1992; 116: 783-797PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bach I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4229-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These two isoforms, which differ in the insertion of 26 amino acids between the POUs domain and the homeodomain, retain compatible dimerization domains and essentially identical DNA binding and transactivation domains. This pattern of alternative splicing is conserved through evolution from rodents to humans. It remains unclear why these two structurally highly similar proteins are co-expressed and whether they display distinct or complementary functions in vivo. In the present study, we have examined whether vHNF1-A, vHNF1-B, and HNF1 have similar or distinct functions during the process of VE specification upon differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into embryoid bodies (EB). The EBs derived from ES cells homozygous deleted for vHnf1 display a specific block in the formation of a surrounding layer of VE and lack the expression of early and late VE markers, whereas other differentiation programs do not appear to be affected (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore took advantage of our homozygous vHnf1-deficient ES cells, which are deleted of the two vHNF1 spliced isoforms and in which activation of HNF1 is impaired upon differentiation, to stably reexpress vHNF1-A, vHNF1-B, or HNF1. Using this model system, we show here that vHNF1-A and vHNF1-B isoforms exhibit similar and complementary functions in the VE specification, whereas HNF1 alone can substitute for the function of both vHNF1 isoforms in this process. On the basis of recent studies (24Fujikura J. Yamato E. Yonemura S. Hosoda K. Masui S. Nakao K. Miyazaki Ji J. Niwa H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and the results presented here, we also propose an integrative model of the regulatory network that governs the establishment and maturation of the VE. Plasmid Constructs—The 2.3-kb rat HNF1 cDNA, the 1.6 kb rat vHNF1-A, and mouse vHNF1-B cDNAs were cloned in the pCB6 vector (25Brewer C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and the polyadenylation site of the bovine growth hormone at the BglII site. All the reporter plasmids contain the bacterial gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). palb-CAT –386/+4 (26Ott M.O. Sperling L. Herbomel P. Yaniv M. Weiss M.C. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2505-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) is a construct containing a promoter derived from the rat albumin promoter driving the CAT reporter gene. pHAF-CAT contains the –1023 to +33 bp region of the mouse Afp promoter (27Molne M. Houart C. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3447-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). pHNF4α-CAT contains the –572 to +25 region of the mouse Hnf4α promoter (28Taraviras S. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. Kelsey G. Mech. Dev. 1994; 48: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and was generated by PCR using mouse genomic DNA and the primers forward (TTCAGCTGGAGCAACCAAGAGATATC) and reverse (TCCCTTCTCTGCCTTCCTCTC). The PCR product was cloned in pGEM-Teasy (Promega), verified by sequencing, and subsequently subcloned into the pBLCAT6 (29Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The HNF1 binding sites within these plasmids and their localization within the original promoters of the genes tested are as follows: for the AFP reporter, two sites at –131 and –67, respectively (30Feuerman M. Godbout R. Ingram R. Tilghman S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 4204-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); for the HNF4α reporter, a site at –98 (28Taraviras S. Monaghan A.P. Schutz G. Kelsey G.

Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7276-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); and for the albumin reporter, a site at –60 (32Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). HNF1, vHNF1-A, and vHNF1-B cDNAs were cloned in the β-actin-puro expression vector at the BamHI site (33Cheng A.M. Saxton T.M.

Cell Culture, Transfections, and ES Cell Electroporation—Human epithelial cervical tumor cells (C33) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were carried out by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure as described by Power and Cereghini (34Power S.C. Cereghini S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 778-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with increasing amounts of expression vectors (1–200 ng), 2 μg of the reporter plasmid containing the promoter of interest driving the CAT reporter gene, and 0.6 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase as an internal control for transfection. Total amount of expression vector was equalized with the pCB6 plasmid. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by the standard colorimetric method, and CAT assays were performed as described by Seed and Sheen (35Seed B. Sheen J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Each measurement was repeated at least four times with different plasmid preparations. ES cells were cultured and differentiated as described by Barbacci et al. (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of HNF1-βactin-puro vector or vHNF1-βactin-puro vector were linearized after digestion with SfiI restriction enzyme and electroporated into 1 × 107 vHnf1–/– ES cells (clone 9), resuspended in 800 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum at 180 V and 1050 microfarads. Transfected ES cells were grown 5 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin, and roughly 30 puromycin-resistant clones for each electroporation were picked for amplification. Protein Extracts and Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Gel retardation assays were performed as described by Cereghini (32Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The probes used encompassed the HNF1 binding site of the albumin promoter (proximal element probe) (32Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and that of the Hnf4α promoter (4FP1 probe) (31Zhong W. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7276-7284Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RNA and Protein Analysis—Screening of the ES clones was carried out by both gel retardation assay and RT-PCR. vHNF1 and HNF1 ES clones were differentiated into EBs as previously described (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA and nuclear protein extractions from ES cells and EBs, gel retardation assay, and first strand cDNA synthesis were performed as described by Cereghini (11Cereghini S. Ott M.O. Power S. Maury M. Development. 1992; 116: 783-797PubMed Google Scholar). 2 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction were amplified in a 25-μl PCR reaction. The number of cycles for amplification of each PCR product was determined to be in the linear phase of amplification. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.8% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane (NX; Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with the corresponding internal probes. RNA levels were normalized by the expression of GAPDH. The forward (f) and reverse (r) primer sequences, chosen in different exons, were as follows: rat/mouse HNF1 f, AGCACCCTTGCCAGCCTC; rat HNF1 f, GATGGCTCTGAGGTGTCT; mouse HNF1 r, GACACCTCAGAGCCATCC; mouse vHNF1 f, TGGTGTCCAAGCTCACGTC; mouse vHNF1 r, CAGTCGGAGGACACCTGCTC; HNF3γ f, ATGCTGGGCTCAGTGAAGAT; HNF3γ r, CAAGCTTGGGAAGGTGGGC; HNF4α1 f, ACCCAGCCTACACCACC; HNF4α1 r, CTTCCTTCTTCATGCCAGCCC; HNF6 f, AACTCCCAGCAAGGACTTCC; HNF6 r, TGCCCTGAATTACTTCCATGGC; HEX f, GTGTACGAGCCCACGCCG; HEX r, TCACTGAGCTGCAACATCTTG; Nodal f, GGAGTTTCATCCTACCAACC; Nodal r, CTGCCATGCCACGGTCGC; IHH f, ACGTGCATTGCTCTGTCAAG; IHH r, CTGGAAAGCTCTCAGCCGGAFP; AFP f, GGATAGCTTCCACGTTAGATTCC, AFP r, TGTTGCCTGGAGGTTTCGGGATCC; albumin f, TGAACTGGCTGACTGCTGTG; albumin r, CATCCTTGGCCTCAGCATAG; αAT-1 f, TGCAATCAGCCTATACCGGGA; αAT-1 r, TCAACTGCAGCTCACTGTCTG; TTR f, AGTCCTGGATGCTGTCCGAG; TTR r, TTCCTGAGCTGCTAACACGG; GAPDH f, TCCAGTATGACTCCACTCAC, GAPDH r, ACCTTGCCCACAGCCTGG. AFP Staining and Histological Analysis—EBs were fixed for 2 min at room temperature in 3% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-formalde-hyde and permeabilized for 15 min in cold methanol. After three washings in PBS, EBs were incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% bovine serum albumin). The primary antibody rabbit anti-AFP (ICN) was incubated at 4 °C overnight at a dilution of 1:400 in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20. After three washings in PBS, EBs were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody rabbit-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Eurobio) used at a dilution of 1:100. Finally, EBs were washed in PBS, mounted with a fluorescence-protecting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories Inc.), and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Thin sections were performed as described by Barbacci et al. (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). New Components of the Visceral Endoderm Regulatory Network Controlled by vHNF1—Differentiation of ES cells into EBs results in the generation of derivatives of the three embryonic germ layers in a process that is reminiscent of early embryogenesis. Around day 4–5, cells at the periphery of the EBs differentiate into primitive endoderm, which subsequently gives rise to visceral and parietal endoderm by day 7. This is followed by processes recapitulating proamniotic cavity formation and the development of a variety of early embryonic cell lineages. Thus, this system is particularly useful to analyze mechanisms of early lineage determination, including the process of VE formation, as well as to investigate the impact of a targeted deletion of a given gene (36Rodda S. Kavanagh S. Rathjen J. Rathjen P. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 449-458PubMed Google Scholar). Using this model, we have shown that vHNF1 is required for the activation of several members of the HNF family including HNF1, HNF3γ, and HNF4α1 as well as a set of genes encoding serum proteins, controlled either by vHNF1, HNF4α1, or both (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined additional potential target genes of vHNF1 to obtain a more comprehensive picture of this regulatory network. RNA was isolated from the wild-type (HM1), the vHnf1+/– (clone 143), and the vHnf1–/– mutant (clone 9) ES cells differentiated into EBs at specific stages, corresponding to critical steps of VE formation and maturation. The vHnf1–/– clone 9 was derived from the vHnf1+/– clone 143. The vHnf1+/– clone 143 displayed no phenotypic differences compared with the parental HM1 ES cell line, with respect to VE differentiation (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1). We focused on the one-cut homeodomain transcription factor HNF6, a member of the HNF family not yet analyzed. HNF6 has recently been reported to participate in the differentiation of various tissues derived from endoderm, including the biliary tract and endocrine cells of the pancreas (37Clotman F. Lannoy V.J. Reber M. Cereghini S. Cassiman D. Jacquemin P. Roskams T. Rousseau G. Lemaigre F. Development. 2002; 129: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Jacquemin P. Durviaux S.M. Jensen J. Godfraind C. Gradwohl G. Guillemot F. Madsen O.D. Carmeliet P. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 4445-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of Hnf6, which is induced, as Hnf1, only at late stages of differentiation, is strongly decreased in the vHnf1–/– EBs as compared with vHnf1+/– or wild-type EBs. The absence of Hnf6 in adult hepatocytes of Hnf1 homozygous mutant mice (39Shih D.Q. Screenan S. Munoz K.N. Philipson L. Pontoglio M. Yaniv M. Polonsky K.S. Stoffel M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2472-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), coupled with this finding, strongly suggest that either vHNF1 or HNF1 directly controls the expression of Hnf6 through an as yet unidentified binding site. In contrast, the expression level of the homeobox transcription factor Hex, first expressed in VE (40Thomas P.Q. Brown A. Beddington R.S. Development. 1998; 125: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar), and a key regulator of liver (41Martinez Barbera J.P. Clements M. Thomas P. Rodriguez T. Meloy D. Kioussis D. Beddington R.S. Development. 2000; 127: 2433-2445PubMed Google Scholar), did not differ between vHnf1–/– and wild-type EBs. The same result was observed for the expression of nodal, a secreted protein present in the embryonic ectoderm and in the VE and involved in the specification of the primitive streak (42Zhou X. Sasaki H. Lowe L. Hogan B.L. Kuehn M.R. Nature. 1993; 361: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 43Conlon F.L. Lyons K.M. Takaesu N. Barth K.S. Kispert A. Herrmann B. Robertson E.J. Development. 1994; 120: 1919-1928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently analyzed other regulatory secreted molecules shown to be involved in early functions of VE. We first examined Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), since it is expressed in the VE of gastrulating mouse embryos (44Farrington S.M. Belaoussoff M. Baron M.H. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to be involved in VE differentiation and in formation of cavities in differentiated ES cells (45Maye P. Becker S. Kasameyer E. Byrd N. Grabel L. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the expression of Ihh, expressed in the VE in ES cell-derived EBs and displaying kinetics strikingly similar to vHnf1 (45Maye P. Becker S. Kasameyer E. Byrd N. Grabel L. Mech. Dev. 2000; 94: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), was strongly decreased in the vHnf1–/– EBs at all stages of differentiation studied. In contrast, the expression of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), which is induced at later stages of differentiation, was only partially reduced in vHnf1–/– EBs at day 19 (Fig. 1), whereas Desert Hedgehog (Dhh) was very weakly expressed at all stages of differentiation in both vHnf1–/– and vHnf1+/– EBs (data not shown). In addition, the expression of different components of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, including Patched (Ptc1 and Ptc2), Smoothened (Smo), and Gli (Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3), was not affected in vHnf1-deficient EBs (data not shown). Similarly, we did not observe any variation in the expression levels of bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4 (BMP-2 and BMP-4), expressed in the VE and ectoderm, respectively, and implicated in cavity formation in embryonal carcinoma EBs (18Coucouvanis E. Martin G.R. Development. 1999; 126: 535-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in this context, the decreased expression of Ihh in our vHnf1–/– EBs could explain, at least in part, the impaired cavity formation. Finally, as for several other serum proteins such as alphafetoprotein (AFP), albumin, alpha-antitrypsin (αAT-1), transferrin, and apolipoprotein-B (12Barbacci E. Reber M. Ott M. Breillat C. Huetz F. Cereghini S. Development. 1999; 126: 4795-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of the transthyretin (Ttr), aldolase B (Aldo B), and pyruvate kinase was absent or severely reduced in vHnf1–/– EBs (Fig. 1; data not shown). These data highlight new components implicated in the regulatory network governed by vHNF1 that specifies the VE: the transcription factor HNF6 and the regulatory molecule IHH, as well as their targets, which are markers of a functional VE. This information will be useful to study the role of vHNF1 isoforms and HNF1 in the differentiation of this cell lineage as described below. Context-dependent Transcriptional Regulation by vHNF1-A and vHNF1-B Isoforms—Transient transfection studies using the albumin promoter as well as a chimeric β-fibrinogen promoter have previously shown that vHNF1-A is a more potent activator than vHNF1-B (8Ringeisen F. Rey-Campos J. Yaniv M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25706-25711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But whether these two isoforms behave differently with respect to other promoters is presently unknown. We therefore reexamined this question in the context of different genes involved in the VE differentiation. We have chosen for this analysis promoters of both early and late markers of this cell lineage, all known targets of vHNF1 and HNF1: the proximal Hnf4α promoter (28Taraviras S. Monaghan A.P.

Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 4204-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the albumin promoter (32Cereghini S. Blumenfeld M. Yaniv M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 957-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), each of which contains either one or two functional HNF1 binding sites (see “Experimental Procedures”). Human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells, which do not express HNF1 or vHNF1 proteins, were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of the pCB6 plasmid (25Brewer C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) containing vHNF1-A, vHNF1-B, and HNF1 cDNAs. In agreement with previous observations (4Rey-Campos J. Chouard T.

Our analysis of a switch I mutant (R210A) in Drosophila melanogaster kinesin showed a reduction in microtubule affinity, a loss in cooperativity between the motor domains, and an ATP hydrolysis defect leading to aberrant detachment from the microtubule. To investigate the conserved arginine in switch I further, a lysine substitution mutant was generated. The R210K dimeric motor has lost the ability to hydrolyze ATP; however, it has rescued microtubule function. Our results show that R210K has restored microtubule association kinetics, microtubule affinity, ADP release kinetics, and motor domain cooperativity. Moreover, the active site at head 1 is able to distinguish ATP, ADP, and AMP-PNP to signal head 2 to bind the microtubule and release mantADP with kinetics comparable with wild-type. Therefore, the structural pathway of communication from head 1 to head 2 is restored, and head 2 can respond to this signal by binding the microtubule and releasing mantADP. Structural modeling revealed that lysine could retain some of the hydrogen bonds made by arginine but not all, suggesting a structural hypothesis for the ability of lysine to rescue microtubule function in the Arg210 mutant.

The ATPase mechanism of kinesin requires that the active site hydrolyze ATP to ADP·Pi and communicate the nucleotide state at the active site to the microtubule to mediate specific conformational changes that generate movement. ATPase activity is stimulated by the microtubule filament (1Kuznetsov S.A. Gelfand V.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8530-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); and therefore, there must also be communication from the microtubule to the active site. The three-dimensional structure of the active site can be organized into a variety of structural motifs that are common to kinesins, myosins, and G-proteins including the P loop (GXXXXGKS/T), switch I (NXXSSRSH), and switch II (DLAGXE) (2Vale R.D.

These studies focused on the proposed role of switch I and switch II in positioning the water molecule that is critical for the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of the γ-phosphate of ATP. The positioning of the water molecule is thought to be through a salt bridge between the conserved arginine in switch I and the conserved glutamic acid in switch II. Mutants in kinesins at either position exhibit dramatic reductions in the steady-state k cat which are attributed to the ATP hydrolysis defect (16Yun M. Zhang X. Park C.G. Park H.W. Endow S.A.

These results suggest a role for communication between the nucleotide and microtubule binding sites. Bound to microtubules, the kinesin neck linker exhibits an ATP-promoted docking transition (25Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M.

Budny M.J. Rice S. Naber N. Fletterick R. Cooke R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 844-848PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallization of kinesin with a docked neck linker suggests that the switch II cluster (downstream element of switch II not involved in nucleotide sensing) moves loop 11, and the flexibility in loop 11 permits switch II cluster movement that in turn allows neck linker docking without shifting the switch II nucleotide sensor. Microtubule binding may order loop 11, allowing for the coupled movement of the switch II cluster with the active site switch II element (35Sindelar C.V. Budny M.J. Rice S. Naber N. Fletterick R.

Using the Drosophila conventional kinesin construct K401-wt, 1The abbreviations used are: K401-wt, wild-type kinesin heavy chain fragment containing the N-terminal 401 amino acids; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; mant, 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl); Mt, microtubule.1The abbreviations used are: K401-wt, wild-type kinesin heavy chain fragment containing the N-terminal 401 amino acids; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; mant, 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl); Mt, microtubule. a mutant was constructed where the conserved arginine of switch I (Arg210 in the Drosophila melanogaster sequence) was changed to an alanine. This mutant did not show a pre-steady-state burst of ADP·Pi product formation in acid quench experiments, indicative of a defect in ATP hydrolysis. The analysis also indicated that ATP hydrolysis was necessary for motor detachment. The experiments outlined a mechanism for kinesin in which ATP hydrolysis occurred after ADP release from the second head, consistent with other published reports (25Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D.

The rate of ADP release from the second head of the Mt·R210A complex was similar using ATP, ADP, or AMP-PNP, whereas conventional wild-type kinesin shows discrimination among these different nucleotides in activating ADP release from the second head (37Gilbert S.P.

The R210A mutant also exhibited a microtubule binding defect, in both pre-steady-state microtubule association experiments and equilibrium microtubule binding experiments. To understand the role of the switch I arginine in greater detail, we examined the kinetics of an arginine to lysine mutation at position 210, referred to as R210K. The results presented here show that the R210K dimeric motor is defective in steady-state ATP turnover with a reduction in the k cat. There was also no pre-steady-state burst of product formation, indicative that replacement of the side chain geometry by the lysine is not sufficient to restore proper ATP hydrolysis. However, replacement with the lysine was able to restore microtubule affinity and the ability of mutant motor to discriminate among ATP, AMP-PNP, and ADP in mantADP release experiments from the second head. In addition, the rates at which mantADP release occurred were near wild-type levels. These data indicate that the mutant kinesin R210K can communicate the nucleotide state to the partner motor domain, and the partner motor domain can respond to the signal by binding the microtubule and releasing mantADP. Furthermore, the structural pathway for communication between the active site and the microtubule has been restored even though the ATP hydrolysis defect is not corrected. Through structural modeling we identified crystal structures of monomeric kinesin which represent an ATP-like structure and a true ADP structure. These structural differences are supported by our kinetic data. We hypothesize that the ability of lysine to rescue microtubule function is the result of its ability to maintain a key hydrogen bond in the ADP state and its inability to form critical hydrogen bonds in the ATP-like state. Materials—Paclitaxel (Taxol, Taxus brevifolia) was purchased from Sigma. Polyethylenimine-cellulose TLC plates (EM Science of Merck, 20 × 20 cm, plastic-backed) were from VWR Scientific (West Chester, PA), and mantATP and mantADP were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Buffer Conditions—The kinetic and equilibrium binding experiments were performed in ATPase buffer (20 mm Hepes pH 7.2 with KOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 25 °C. Concentrations (proteins, nucleotides, etc.) reported are final concentrations after mixing.

DNA sequencing confirmed the arginine to lysine substitution.

R210K at 2 μm was incubated with 0-7 μm microtubules in the absence of added nucleotides for 30 min and subjected to high speed centrifugation. The supernatant was removed, and the microtubule pellet was resuspended in ATPase buffer to the same volume as the supernatant. Laemmli sample buffer (5×) was added to samples of the supernatant and resuspended pellet, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide and 2 m urea). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned by a Microtek Scan Maker X6EL scanner (Microtek, Redondo Beach, CA). The scanned image was quantified (NIH Image version 1.62) to determine the concentration of R210K in the supernatant and pellet at each microtubule concentration. Fig. 2 presents the data as fractional binding, which is defined as the ratio of R210K in the pellet to total R210K (2 μm), plotted as a function of microtubule concentration. The data were fit to quadratic Equation 1, Mt·E/E0=0.5((E0+Mt0+Kd)-((E0+Mt0+Kd)2-(4E0Mt0))1/2)(Eq. 1) where Mt·E/E 0 is the fraction of R210K that sediments with the microtubules, E 0 is total R210K concentration, Mt0 is the total tubulin concentration as microtubule polymer, and K d is the dissociation constant. Rapid Quench Experiments—R210A was noted to have an ATP hydrolysis defect (26Farrell C.M. Mackey A.T. Klumpp L.M. Gilbert S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17079-17087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We performed similar experiments with R210K in comparison to wild-type K401 (51Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to determine whether the two mutants shared the same ATP hydrolysis defect. The preformed Mt·R210K complex (syringe concentrations: 16 μm R210K, 30 μm microtubules, 40 μm Taxol) was mixed rapidly in a chemical quenched-flow instrument (RQF-3, Kintek Corp., Austin, TX) with 100 μm [α-32P]ATP (see Fig. 3). The reaction was terminated with 5 m formic acid (syringe concentration) and expelled from the instrument. The radiolabeled product (ADP·Pi) was separated from the radiolabeled reactant (ATP) by thin layer chromatography, and the data were quantified. The concentration of [α-32P]ADP was determined for each time point and plotted as a function of time (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The data were then fit to the burst equation, product=A*(1-exp(-kbt))+ksst(Eq. 2) where A is the amplitude of the pre-steady-state burst phase which represents the formation of [α-32P]ADP·Pi at the active site during the first ATP turnover; k b is the rate constant of the exponential burst phase; t is time in seconds; and k ss is the rate constant of the linear phase (μm ADP·s-1). The rate constant k ss, when divided by enzyme concentration, corresponds to the rate of steady-state turnover at the same ATP and microtubule concentrations. Stopped-flow Kinetics—The pre-steady-state kinetics of mantATP binding, R210K binding to microtubules, ATP-promoted dissociation of R210K, and mantADP release were all conducted using the SF-2001 KinTek stopped-flow instrument in ATPase buffer at 25 °C. For the mantATP and mantADP experiments, the excitation wavelength was 360 nm (mercury arc lamp) with emitted light measured through a 400 nm cutoff filter (mant λemm = 450 nm). The mantATP binding data in the inset of Fig. 4A were fit Equation 3, kobs=k1[mantATP]+koff(Eq. 3) where k obs is the rate of the initial exponential increase in fluorescence, k 1 is the second-order rate constant for mantATP binding (see Scheme 1), and k off obtained from the y intercept is the rate of mantATP dissociation from the Mt·R210K·mantATP complex.Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The microtubule association kinetics (see Fig. 5) and the ATP-promoted dissociation kinetics (see Fig. 6) were performed by observation of the change in turbidity at 340 nm. The exponential rate constants (k obs) for microtubule association were plotted as a function of microtubule concentration and fit to Equation 4, kobs=k5[tubulin]+k-5(Eq. 4) where k obs is the rate of the observed exponential process, k 5 is the second-order rate constant for microtubule association (see Scheme 1), and k -5 obtained from the y intercept is the rate constant for motor dissociation from the Mt·R210K complex.Fig. 6ATP-promoted dissociation kinetics of Mt·R210K and Mt·K401. In the stopped-flow, the Mt·R210K or the Mt·K401 complex (both at 6 μm motor, 6 μm tubulin, 10 μm Taxol) was mixed rapidly with 1 mm MgATP + 100 mm KCl, and a change in turbidity was monitored. Both transients were fit to two exponential functions. For R210K, the amplitude of the fast initial phase was 0.0107 ± 0.0002 with k obs = 17.7 ± 0.7 s-1. For K401, the fit of the data yielded an amplitude of the fast initial phase = 0.049 ± 0.001 and the k obs = 14.9 ± 0.3 s-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Structural Modeling—The structural modeling of Fig. 10 was performed on a Silicon Graphics work station using the program O (52Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and rendered using PyMOL (53DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). The hydrogen bonding capability of Arg210 was compared in the monomeric kinesin rat structure, 2KIN (20Sack S. Muller J. Marx A. Thormahlen M. Mandelkow E.M. Brady S.T. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16155-16165Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and the monomeric kinesin human structure, 1BG2 (18Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Asn256 in 2KIN was rotated by 180° about χ2 such that Nδ2 and Oδ1 are switched (this produces a model more consistent with the hydrogen bonding potential of this residue and its immediate environment). Mutant models were generated by redecorating the polypeptide backbone, followed by rotomer selection based on visual inspection using O (52Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Rotomers were also examined for adjacent residues. A stereochemically sensible model could be obtained by rotomer selection at Lys203 and Glu199, followed by minimal manual readjustment of the side chains (see Fig. 10C). Steady-state and Equilibrium Properties of R210K—We began our analysis by examining the steady-state kinetics of R210K (Fig. 1). For R210K, the rate of ATP turnover increased as a function of ATP concentration with the k cat = 0.03 s-1. Compared with K401-wt, there is a 700-fold decrease in the steady-state ATPase from 19.5 to 0.03 s-1 (Fig. 1B). The depressed k cat was similar to the constant observed for the R210A switch I mutant at 0.12 s-1, but the K m,ATP for R210K at 38 μm indicated higher affinity for ATP compared with R210A at 118 μm and K401-wt at 107 μm (Fig. 1 and Table I).Table IMicrotubule-kinesin constantsExperimentally observeda20 mm Hepes pH 7.2, with KOH, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C.Computer simulation,bExperimentally determined rate constants refined by computer simulation (37, 38, 62).

https://openalex.org/W1985421203,"ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins are monomeric GTPases that are essential for membrane transport and exocytosis in a number of secretory cells. We investigated ARF6, the activation of which is insensitive to brefeldin A, to determine whether it regulates membrane traffic in gastric parietal cells. ARF6 translocated from cytosol to tubulovesicle in the presence of GTPgammaS, a potential inhibitor of acid secretion in permeabilized cells, whereas under the Mg2+-chelated condition where activity of ARF-GTPase activating protein is inhibited, ARF6 translocated to the apical secretory membrane. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that ARF6 mainly located in parietal cell within the gastric glands, and it translocated from the cytosol to the intracellular canaliculi when the glands were stimulated. These results indicated that the distribution of ARF6 between cytosol and the two different membranes was regulated by its GTPase activity. In cultured gastric glands infected with adenovirus expressing ARF6 Q67L, a mutant lacking GTP hydrolysis activity, gastric acid secretion was inhibited. These results suggest that ARF6 regulates gastric acid secretion in parietal cell and that the GTP hydrolysis cycle of ARF6 is essential for the activation pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2021561975,"Removal of external calcium with EGTA (from 2.5 mm to nanomolar levels) caused a remarkable depolarization in human sperm. This depolarization was initially fast. It was followed by a slow phase that brought the Vm to values of over 0 mV in 1–2 min. The slow and sustained phase correlated with a sustained decrease in intracellular calcium. However, calcium removal still induced depolarization in sperm with enhanced intracellular calcium (induced by progesterone), indicating that the sustained depolarization was not caused by a sustained intracellular calcium decrease. The depolarization was reduced as the external sodium content was substituted with choline, indicating that it was due to a sodium current, and was observed in lithium but not in tetramethylammonium-containing medium. In low sodium medium, the addition of sodium after calcium removal induced depolarization to the extent of which slightly increased in 2 min. The depolarization was completely inhibited by external magnesium (Ki = 1.16 mm). The addition of calcium or magnesium to calcium removal-induced depolarized sperm induced hyperpolarization that was inhibited by ouabain and was also prevented in medium without potassium, suggesting that the activity of the electrogenic Na+,K+-ATPase was involved. The conductance activated by calcium removal might unveil the presence of a calcium channel that in the absence of external calcium allows sodium permeation and that in normal conditions might contribute to the resting intracellular calcium concentration.

Sperm of mammalian species present physiological changes that involve modulation of calcium entry mechanisms. In the female reproductive tract or in vitro in defined media, sperm undergoes in hours a series of complex biochemical changes known as “capacitation.” Capacitation leads to changes in sperm motility patterns that requires calcium influx, resulting in an increment of ∼100 nm in resting intracellular calcium ([Ca2+] i) (1Baldi R. Casano C. Falsetti C. Krauz M. Forti G. J. Androl. 1991; 12: 323-330PubMed Google Scholar, 2Blackmore P.F. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Mendoza C. Tesarik J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Only capacitated sperm bind to the zona pellucida and undergo the acrosome reaction (4Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M. Dev. Biol. 1983; 95: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), an exocytotic process necessary for egg-sperm fusion. The acrosome reaction is physiologically induced by the egg zona pellucida glycoprotein ZP3, which triggers a rapid increase in [Ca2+] i that may involve the gating of voltage-dependent (VDCC) 1The abbreviations used are: VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium channels; SOC, store-operated calcium channels; diSC3(5), diisopropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide; H-HSM, Hepes-buffered human sperm medium; PTI, Photon Technology International; TMA, tetramethylammonium.1The abbreviations used are: VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium channels; SOC, store-operated calcium channels; diSC3(5), diisopropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide; H-HSM, Hepes-buffered human sperm medium; PTI, Photon Technology International; TMA, tetramethylammonium. and activation of store-operated (SOC) calcium channels (5Arnoult C.

Hence, it is evident that the study of the ion transport systems that set and regulate the membrane potential and the [Ca2+] i is necessary to fully understand the molecular basis of capacitation and acrosome reaction in human sperm. Unfortunately, the head of mature sperm is not suitable for patch clamp methods because of its particular shape and small size (7Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinoza F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the use of optical methods to detect membrane potential and intracellular ions have provided valuable information regarding the ion transport mechanism in mammalian sperm populations. The resting membrane potential values obtained with fluorescent probes in mouse and human sperm populations range between –60 and –20 mV (8González-Martínez M.T.

Biol. 1995; 171: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Incidentally, it has been observed that in medium prepared without calcium, the resting membrane potential of human sperm populations have depolarized values as compared with those incubated in calcium-containing media (12Foresta C. Rossato F. DiVirgilio F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Bonilla-Hernández M.A. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In mouse sperm, the addition of calcium to sperm incubated in medium without calcium produces a transient plasma membrane hyperpolarization that is in part sensitive to the Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (10Espinosa F. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This evidence has led to the notion that calcium may regulate the resting membrane potential in mammalian sperm. In this paper, I report the effect of removing calcium from the medium and the subsequent calcium readdition on membrane potential and intracellular calcium in human sperm. It was possible to precisely compare membrane potential and internal calcium changes in human sperm population by using a simultaneous recording system (13Guzmán-Grenfell A.M.

González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1372: 1-12Google Scholar). It was found that removing calcium from the medium with EGTA produces a magnesium-sensitive, sodium-dependent depolarization in human sperm. This evidence suggests that sperm is endowed with calcium channels that in the absence of calcium allow sodium permeation. Materials and Media—Diisopropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide diSC3(5) was obtained from Molecular Probes. Fura-2/AM (acetoxymethyl ester), ionomycin, and valinomycin were from Sigma. The other reagents were obtained from Sigma, Merck, or Baker. Hepes-buffered human sperm medium (H-HSM), originally proposed by Suarez et al. (15Suarez S.S. Wolf D.P. Meizel S. Gamete Res. 1986; 14: 107-121Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar), had the following composition (in mm): 117.5 NaCl, 8.6 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 0.3 NaH2PO4, 0.49 MgCl2, 0.3 sodium pyruvate, 19 sodium lactate, 2 glucose, and 25 HEPES-Na (pH 7.6). H-HSM was modified so that NaCl was substituted with choline-Cl (lowNaH-HSM). This medium still contained ∼32 mm sodium (Na-Hepes, sodium lactate, sodium pyruvate, and NaH2PO4). Sperm Purification and Fura-2/AM Loading—Human semen was obtained from a panel of eight healthy 18–24-year-old donors. Normal samples were selected according to the World Health Organization protocol as reported previously (14Linares-Hernández L. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Hicks-Gómez J.J. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1372: 1-12Google Scholar). Sperm purification was performed using Percoll gradients according to Suarez et al. (15Suarez S.S. Wolf D.P. Meizel S. Gamete Res. 1986; 14: 107-121Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (14Linares-Hernández L. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Hicks-Gómez J.J. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1372: 1-12Google Scholar). Purified sperm (0.6–1.5 × 108 cells) were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2/AM in 2 ml of H-HSM medium at 36 °C for 40 min. Once washed, cells were incubated in 25 ml of H-HSM medium at 36 °C and immediately used for intracellular calcium and membrane potential measurements. Simultaneous Measurement and Calibration of [Ca2 + ]i and Membrane Potential—Membrane potential and [Ca2+] i were simultaneously detected with the fluorescent probes diSC3(5) and Fura-2/AM, respectively, with a PTI fluorometer (Photon Technology International) as reported previously (14Linares-Hernández L. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Hicks-Gómez J.J. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1372: 1-12Google Scholar). 2–5 ml of Fura-2/AM-loaded sperm (corresponding to ∼1 × 107 cells) was centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. The pellet (∼100 μl) was immediately added to the fluorescence cuvette containing 2.5 ml of H-HSM (or other) + 0.5 μm diSC3(5), previously thermostatized at 36 °C and under constant magnetic stirring. The fluorometer has two photomultipliers placed at 90° with respect to the Xenon lamp source. One photomultiplier detected the Fura-2/AM signal with a 488-nm filter (Andover), exciting at 340/380 with the excitation monochromator of the PTI system. The other photomultiplier detected the diSC3(5) fluorescence at 670 nm, exciting at 600 nm with a halide lamp placed in front of the xenon source. Both excitation and emission wavelengths for diSC3(5) measurements were achieved with optical interference filters (Andover). Data was acquired and digitalized at 0.83 Hz with the PTI interface system. Calibrations—The diSC3(5) fluorescence was calibrated in Fura-2/AM-loaded sperm suspensions as reported previously (14Linares-Hernández L. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Hicks-Gómez J.J. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1372: 1-12Google Scholar) with some modifications. At the end of each trace, 1.5 μm of the potassium ionophore valinomycin was added to bring the membrane potential to the Nernst potential value for potassium distribution (EK = –61.54 mV log [K]in/[K]ext). Taking into account that [K]in of human sperm is 120 mm (14Linares-Hernández L. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Hicks-Gómez J.J. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1372: 1-12Google Scholar) and T = 36 °C, the EK estimated for human sperm populations in H-HSM (K ext = 8.6 mm) is –71 mV. One minute after valinomycin, step depolarization to –43, –30, and –15 mV every 30 s was induced with consecutive additions of 15, 15, and 30 mm KCl. These depolarization concomitantly increased the fluorescence of diSC3(5) fluorescence. There is a linear relationship between the fractional change of diSC3(5) fluorescence (f = F – Fo /Fo , where Fo is the fluorescence value obtained upon valinomycin addition and F is the actual fluorescence value) and the membrane potential (16Wagoneer A.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1979; 8: 47-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) with a slope that in the sperm ranged between 0.018 and 0.025 (fractional change of fluorescence per millivolt). Taking the calibration parameters into account, the actual values of fluorescence were transformed into membrane potential values (Vm) according to Equation 1, Vm=F/mFo-1/m-b/m(Eq. 1) where m and b are the parameters of the linear calibration curve, i.e. the slope and the y axis value (fractional change of fluorescence) at 0 mV, respectively. These parameters were obtained by fitting linear the calibration data with a Microcal Origin, version 6.0 software. A calibration curve was made for each single trace using the step calibration described above with a maximal calibration value of –15 mV. However, the linear relationship is maintained up to +5 mV (range tested, data not shown). It should be noted that mitochondrial potential does not contribute to diSC3(5) signal in human sperm (13Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Bonilla-Hernández M.A. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a minor role of this organelle in supporting human sperm motility (17Hong C.Y. Chiang B.N. Wei Y.H. Br.

Thus, simultaneous measurements of intracellular calcium and membrane potential were performed in the absence of mitochondrial inhibitors or uncouplers. The Fura-2/AM values were calibrated in H-HSM containing 500 nm diSC3(5) as reported previously (14Linares-Hernández L. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Hicks-Gómez J.J. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1372: 1-12Google Scholar). Experimental Assays—The effect of calcium removal from the medium with the calcium chelator EGTA on the intracellular calcium and membrane potential in human sperm was investigated. To conduct this test, 3 mm EGTA was added to the medium to decrease the 2.5 mm calcium present in H-HSM to nanomolar levels (see below). Because calcium chelation with EGTA produces proton release at an extent that can acidify the Hepes-buffered H-HSM medium, the concentrated EGTA solution (500 mm) was prepared in 3.2 m NaOH. In this condition, the addition of 3 mm EGTA to H-HSM did not produce any change in H-HSM pH (measured with a pH electrode). To estimate the calcium concentration in mixtures of EGTA-Ca in H-HSM and in H-HSM supplemented with magnesium, the calcium concentration calculator program Maxchelator (V.2.1) written by Chris Patton from the Hopkins Marine Station (Stanford University) was used. Statistical Analysis—Numeric results are expressed as the means ± S.E. n means number of individuals tested and analyzed with Student's t tests. Two-tailed p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Fig. 1A shows the effect of 3 mm EGTA on the membrane potential and intracellular calcium detected simultaneously in human sperm. At this concentration, EGTA diminishes the extracellular calcium from 2.5 mm to ∼129 nm (see “Experimental Procedures”). The addition of EGTA caused a decrease in [Ca2+] i from an average of 220 ± 22 nm to 61 ± 6nm with a 50% decrease time of 8.7 ± 1.9 s (n = 8 individuals ± S.E.). Concomitantly, a remarkable depolarization of the plasma membrane was induced. The depolarization was initially fast and was followed by a large and slow phase that brought the membrane potential from resting –46 ± 3 to +18 ± 3.4 mV (n = 8, mean ± S.E.) in 1–2 min. This value remained nearly constant after a 10-min incubation in the fluorescence cell (data not shown). Once the membrane potential reached a constant value, 3 mm CaCl2 was added to restore the original calcium concentration. This addition produced an overshut in [Ca2+] i, i.e. a fast increase in [Ca2+] i that reached a peak in seconds at values above the resting internal calcium (495 ± 32 nm) and then was followed by a slow decrease that brought in ∼2 min the [Ca2+] i near to resting values. Concomitantly, calcium restoration produced a slow hyperpolarization that reached constant values in 2–3 min. In most cases, the membrane potential reached values more negative than resting (-66 ± 3.9 mV, n = 8, after 3 min of calcium addition), indicating that the membrane potential was not reversed to resting conditions. However, the mechanism involved in the depolarization induced by calcium removal was reversible. As shown in Fig. 1A, calcium removal induced by a further addition of 3.5 mm EGTA still induced depolarization that was again reversed by calcium readdition. The effect of EGTA was studied at different concentrations (Fig. 1B). The addition of 4.0, 3.0, and 2.75 mm EGTA that decreases the H-HSM external calcium concentration to approximately 41, 129, and 261 nm, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”), caused in all of the cases sustained intracellular calcium decreases and sustained depolarization. These changes reached similar values, indicating that the effect of EGTA was saturating in both parameters. The addition of 2.0 and 2.25 mm EGTA that leaves ∼500 and 250 μm calcium in the medium produced small and fast transient depolarization with almost no change in internal calcium (Fig. 1B). The transient peaks slightly increased as the external calcium concentration decreased. The addition of 2.5 mm EGTA (that diminished calcium to 8 μm) produced in this case a large but transient depolarization, which was accompanied with a transient [Ca2+] i decrease, the depolarization phase was related to the decrease in [Ca2+] i and the hyperpolarization phase to [Ca2+] i recovery to resting values. This external calcium concentration (8 μm) seemed to be close to a critical concentration, which could lead to either a sustained or transient depolarization, as suggested by the fact that in some experiments 2.5 mm EGTA induced sustained depolarization. In these cases, the sustained depolarization was always accompanied by sustained decreases in [Ca2+] i (traces not shown). To explore whether the sustained depolarization was caused by the sustained [Ca2+] i decrease, the effect of calcium removal was studied in cells with a high [Ca2+] i content. To do this, a rise in [Ca2+] i was induced by progesterone (2Blackmore P.F. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8González-Martínez M.T. Bonilla-Hernández M.A. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and at the moment that [Ca2+] i reached enhanced values, calcium removal was induced. As shown in figure 2, calcium removal triggered depolarization at [Ca2+] i values as high as 400 nm that was reversed by calcium readdition. The depolarization progressed and reached sustained values as the [Ca2+] i decrease occurred even above resting values having 80% of the total depolarization when the decreasing [Ca2+] i reached resting values. This finding indicated that the sustained decrease in [Ca2+] i did not provoke by itself the sustained depolarization induced by calcium removal and supported the hypothesis that the whole depolarization is caused by calcium removal from external binding sites. The ion transport mechanism involved in the depolarization induced by calcium removal was studied by modifying the ionic composition of H-HSM. The total NaCl content was substituted with choline-Cl in H-HSM, a medium that still contains ∼51 mm sodium from 19 mm sodium lactate + ∼12.5 mm Na-Hepes + 0.3 mm NaHPO3 + 0.3 sodium pyruvate and ∼19 mm NaOH when the mixture EGTA-NaOH is added to the fluorescence cell (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, in a wide range of sodium concentrations from 51 to 169 mm, the resting intracellular calcium and resting membrane potential values remained closed. In contrast, the EGTA-induced depolarization was remarkably diminished: the lower the external sodium, the lower the depolarization with no depolarization or slight hyperpolarization at 51 mm external sodium. This result indicated that the depolarization induced by calcium removal was attributed to a sodium current. In these experiments, the effect of calcium readdition is also shown. The smaller the sodium-dependent depolarization, the smaller the hyperpolarization induced by calcium restoration. It was noticeable that at low external sodium concentrations, calcium readdition produced a small transient depolarization. At high external [Na] (>70 mm), the hyperpolarization induced by calcium readdition seemed to hide the transient depolarization observed at low external [Na]. The calcium peak induced by calcium readdition in EGTA-treated sperm was smaller in low sodium medium as compared with normal H-HSM medium. To explore whether the sodium-dependent depolarization triggered by calcium removal inactivated or has inactivating components, the effect of sodium addition after calcium removal on the membrane potential was evaluated in lowNaH-HSM. Fig. 4 shows that 60 mm NaCl that was added 1 and 2 min after calcium removal with EGTA produced a depolarization that was similar in shape and in extent slightly bigger (120 ± 10%, n = 5, p < 0.05, after 2 min) than when the depolarization was triggered by EGTA in lowNaH-HSM medium supplemented with 60 mm NaCl. These experiments indicated that the sodium-dependent depolarization induced by calcium removal did not inactivate in at least 2 min in lowNaH-HSM but, conversely, a slight activation occurred. The selectivity of the sodium-dependent depolarization was studied. The effect of calcium removal induced by 3 mm EGTA was analyzed in lowNaH-HSM supplemented with 60 mm NaCl, LiCl, or TMA-Cl (tetramethylammonium chloride). As shown in Fig. 5, no depolarization was observed in medium with TMA. In contrast, in lithium containing medium, the depolarization was significantly (p < 0.05) larger (47 ± 4.0 mV, n = 4) than in sodium-containing medium (30 ± 3.8 mV). It was not possible to extend these studies to potassium, cesium, and rubidium since these cations caused depolarization of the membrane potential to values close to the Ek = –15 mV. It has been established that some calcium channels allow sodium influx in the absence of calcium that is blocked by magnesium (19Carbone E. Lux H.D. Carabelli V. Aicardi G. Zucker H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 1-15Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Thus, it was pertinent to explore whether the sodium-dependent depolarization induced by calcium removal was affected by magnesium. In the range of magnesium tested (up to 3 mm), the resting membrane potential, the resting [Ca2+]i, and particularly, the [Ca2+]i decrease induced by calcium removal were almost unaffected (Fig. 6A). However, increasing amounts of MgCl2 in the H-HSM medium caused a remarkable inhibition of the sodium-dependent depolarization induced by calcium removal with EGTA (Fig. 6A) with a Ki of 1.16 ± 0.12 mm (n = 5, mean ± S.E.) (Fig. 6B). Expectedly, magnesium was also able to reverse the depolarization induced by calcium removal (Fig. 6C). The hyperpolarization was dependent on the magnesium concentration and reached saturation at values close to those that produced blockade of the depolarization induced by calcium removal. Interestingly, the hyperpolarization was not related to any change in intracellular calcium. This suggested that at least a considerable extent of the hyperpolarization did not depend on the calcium influx or on the intracellular calcium increase that is induced by calcium addition in EGTA-treated sperm. The hyperpolarization induced by calcium and magnesium on calcium removal-induced depolarized sperm was studied. In mouse sperm, it has been observed that in calcium-deprived medium, calcium addition produce a transient hyperpolarization that is partially blocked by ouabain (10Espinosa F. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis that this hyperpolarization is in part related to the electrogenic 3Na+,2K+-ATPase activity. In human sperm, ouabain induces a slight depolarization in resting sperm (Fig. 7) (13Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Bonilla-Hernández M.A. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and no apparent effect on the depolarization was induced by calcium removal (Fig. 7). The hyperpolarization induced by calcium restoration and by magnesium was inhibited by ouabain, suggesting that the activity of a Na+,K+-ATPase contributed in a considerable extent to the hyperpolarization (Fig. 7). Consistently, the hyperpolarization was prevented on H-HSM prepared without potassium, a condition that stops the 3Na+,2K+-ATPase activity (21Robinson J.J. Flashner M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 549: 145-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Expectedly, the further addition of 1 mm KCl that should start the pump activity at saturating levels (21Robinson J.J. Flashner M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 549: 145-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) caused hyperpolarization, the extent of which was similar to those observed in normal H-HSM (Fig. 7). In this paper, evidence is presented indicating that a remarkable depolarization carried out by sodium influx is triggered in human sperm when calcium is suddenly removed from the external medium. The depolarization has two apparent components. The initial one is fast, occurs in seconds, and is followed by the slow one that brings the membrane potential to values over 0 mV in 1–2 min. This permeability pathway remains open and is slightly stimulated in 2 min in lowNaH-HSM medium. It has a higher selectivity for lithium than for sodium and does not allow permeation of large monovalent cations like tetramethylammonium. The sodium-dependent depolarization values induced by calcium removal are far from the Nernst potential for sodium distribution (E Na). For instance, taking into consideration that [Na]in = 18 mm in human sperm (22Patrat C. Serres C. Jouannet P. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 1380-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) at 121 mm external sodium, the E Na = +51 mV and the membrane potential reached upon calcium removal is ∼ –3 mV (Fig. 4). This indicates that the sodium-sensitive membrane potential value should result from the activation of the putative sodium current plus preexisting conductance that set the membrane potential in normal conditions and/or other conductance that is induced to buffer the depolarizing membrane potential. Potassium efflux though the activated permeability pathway could also explain why the sodium-dependent depolarization does not reach the E Na, even though potassium permeability should be considerably lower than that of sodium since the Ek = –71 mV. What kind of electrogenic sodium transporter may cause the depolarization induced by external calcium removal? Activation of an electrogenic 3Na+,1Ca2+ exchange should be discarded since experiments made in low sodium medium show that (a) the depolarization induced by sodium or lithium can be triggered in the absence of any change in [Ca2+] i , indicating that the depolarization occurs independently of changes in [Ca2+] i and (b) calcium removal decreases [Ca2+] i without affecting the membrane potential, indicating that the [Ca2+] i decrease may occur independently of the sodium-dependent depolarization. The most coherent hypothesis is that the sodium-dependent depolarization is caused by opening of sodium channels that are normally blocked by calcium ions. The simultaneous detection of intracellular calcium indicates that the initial fast component of the depolarization may occur before the [Ca2+] i starts to decrease. Indeed, this fast component may be triggered transiently when external calcium is suddenly lowered to the hundreds of micromolar range with EGTA at [Ca2+] i values still close to resting. The slow, large, and sustained depolarization is always accompanied by a slow [Ca2+] i decrease to levels below 100 nm and is induced when the external calcium concentration is lowered to the units of micromolar range being reproducibly observed in the hundreds of nanomolar range. In principle, the fact that a sustained [Ca2+] i decrease was always related to the sustained sodium-dependent depolarization suggested that there was an intracellular control site at [Ca2+] i with a Kd below 100 nm. However, the depolarization induced by calcium removal was observed even when the [Ca2+] i was enhanced with progesterone, indicating that the induction of depolarization is related to calcium removal from external binding sites. The inhibitory effect of magnesium on the depolarization induced by calcium removal and its ability to reverse the depolarization support the notion that the putative channel is controlled by divalent cation. Magnesium may act at the same level than calcium but with a much lower affinity (Ki = 1.16 mm). A sodium channel blocked in normal media seems to play no role in sperm physiology. Alternatively, the putative sodium channel may reveal the presence of a calcium channel in the plasma membrane that allows sodium permeation in the absence of external calcium. l-Type VDCC and transient receptor potential channels such as the SOCs allow large sodium currents when external calcium is brought to nanomolar and micromolar levels, respectively (19Carbone E. Lux H.D. Carabelli V. Aicardi G. Zucker H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 504: 1-15Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Minke B. Cook B. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 429-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In mature human sperm, there is a nifedipine-insensitive voltage-dependent calcium influx system, suggesting that these cells are endowed with VDCC (8González-Martínez M.T. Bonilla-Hernández M.A. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 408: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Linares-Hernández L. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Hicks-Gómez J.J. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1372: 1-12Google Scholar). Molecular biology studies indicate that human sperm have a peculiar form of VDCC called cat sperm (23Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 24Quill T.A. Ren D. Clapham D.E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12527-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Even though these channels might allow sodium permeation in the absence of calcium, the sodium-dependent depolarization induced by calcium removal can be triggered even in hyperpolarized sperm (as shown in the second response in Fig. 1) in which VDCC should be mostly deactivated (14Linares-Hernández L. Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Hicks-Gómez J.J. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 1372: 1-12Google Scholar). Additionally, in some experiments, the depolarization was observed in sperm with resting membrane potential close to –15 mV in which VDCC should be inactivated (data not shown). This evidence indicates that depolarization is not caused by the opening of these channels. However, as sperm depolarizes (by calcium removal induction), the gating of VDCC and perhaps contribution to depolarization would be expected if these channels allow sodium to pass through. The acrosome vesicle is an internal store of calcium (25Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 26De Blas G. Michaut M. Trevino C.L.

Kazam I.G. Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S Villaz M. Florman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6757-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), which has been identified as a C2-type TRP protein with the use of antibodies in mouse sperm (27Junknickel M.K. Marrero H. Birnbaumer L. Lemos J.R. Florman H.M. Nature Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In cells suitable for patch clamp recordings, the sodium currents observed in the absence of external calcium could share some properties with the putative channel reported here. Indeed, in rat basophilic leukemia cells, SOC channels are sensitive to external magnesium in the millimolar range, allowing lithium permeation, but show similar selectivity for potassium and sodium (28Kozak J.A. Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 29Bakowski D. Parekh A.B. Pfluegers Arch. 2002; 443: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, SOC channel activation and contribution to the depolarization would be expected as a result of an intra-acrosomal calcium decrease imposed by calcium removal from external medium. However, the initial depolarization response induced by calcium removal in human sperm is too fast to be explained as a result of SOC activation. Nevertheless, SOC could activate later and contribute to the slow depolarization phase. The hypothesis that the sodium-dependent depolarization unveils the presence of a calcium channel has interesting consequences. In normal medium, the calcium influx through these channels must be so small that unlike sodium in the absence of calcium, no contribution to membrane potential is detected. Nevertheless, this calcium channel may have a major contribution to resting [Ca2+] i. This hypothesis implies that when calcium is removed from external binding sites, the calcium influx through the calcium channel is stopped and becomes a sodium-conducting channel depolarizing the cell. Consequently, the calcium-extruding mechanism, which must be permanently activated to control the resting [Ca2+] i , would cause the [Ca2+] i decrease. This decrease is possibly related to the activity of a Ca2+ATPase present in the plasma membrane that diminishes its own activity as [Ca2+] i decreases (30Edes I. Kranias E.G. Sperelakis N. Cell Physiology Source Book, Section II. Transport Physiology, Pumps and Exchangers. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1998: 225-236Google Scholar). When calcium is restored, the channel would switch its selectivity for calcium and allow calcium to pass through, increasing the [Ca2+] i. Because the calcium conductance through this channel would be much lower than sodium, no contribution to membrane potential would be expected. As for the effects of magnesium, the possibility that the putative channel allows magnesium permeation remains to be established. In any case, the hyperpolarization induced by calcium or by magnesium would be observed as a lack of contribution of the depolarizing sodium conductance to the membrane potential. The fact that the hyperpolarization is sensitive to ouabain and prevented in medium without potassium suggests that the activity of the 3Na+,2K+-ATPase is the main prevailing conductance that would hyperpolarize sperm by virtue of its electrogenic exchange. Interestingly, ouabain has a small depolarizing effect on resting membrane potential (Fig. 7) (13Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Bonilla-Hernández M.A. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that the 3Na+/2K+-ATPase does not importantly contribute to set it in resting condition. This suggests that as sperm depolarize (by calcium removal induction), the enzyme increases its activity possibly because of intracellular sodium loading (10Espinosa F. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This would explain why the Na+,K+-ATPase activity contributes at such a high extent to the membrane potential when magnesium or calcium is added to calcium removal-induced depolarized sperm. This mechanism agrees with that proposed for the transient hyperpolarization induced by calcium in calcium-deprived medium in mouse sperm (10Espinosa F. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A hyperpolarization dependent on the Na+,K+-ATPase activity has also been observed when glucose is added to human sperm incubated in medium without glucose (13Guzmán-Grenfell A.M. Bonilla-Hernández M.A. González-Martínez M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Besides the putative calcium channel, other mechanisms similar to SOC, VDCC, and/or the Na+/Ca+ exchanger might participate in the [Ca2+] i overshut induced by calcium readdition. The small and transient depolarization induced by calcium readdition in low sodium medium may indicate that indeed electrogenic calcium transport system(s) is involved. Accordingly, in mouse sperm incubated in medium prepared without sodium and calcium, calcium induces depolarization that is partially blocked by nimodipine, trifluoperazine, and magnesium, suggesting that this depolarization because of calcium influx through calcium channels (10Espinosa F. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In summary, this work shows evidence that suggests that human sperm is endowed with a magnesium-sensitive sodium conductance that is activated when external calcium is removed from the medium. This conductance may unveil the presence of calcium channels that might contribute to resting intracellular calcium. The physiological role of these putative channels, especially in sperm capacitation where regulation of the resting intracellular calcium is crucial, remains to be explored.

Lanzalunga O. Mancinelli S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The catalytic cycle of LIP is similar to that of other peroxidases (15Tien M. Kirk T.K. Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1687-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Renganathan V. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1626-1631Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The reaction of native ferric enzyme (Fe-LIP; Fe3+PR (porphyrin)) with H2O2 yields LIP-compound I (LIPI), a complex of high valence oxo-iron and PR radical cation (Fe4+ = OPR+.). One-electron oxidation of a reducing substrate by LIPI yields a radical cation and the one electron-oxidized enzyme intermediate, LIP-compound II (LIPII: Fe4+ = O PR). A single one-electron oxidation of a second substrate molecule by LIPII results in the formation of another radical cation and the release of a molecule of water, with the enzyme returned to Fe-LIP, completing the catalytic cycle. The oxidation of phenols by LIPI follows second order kinetics and is linearly proportional to substrate concentration (4Koduri R.S. Tien M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22254-22258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Banci L. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Tien M.

Kinetic studies indicate a hyperbolic concentration dependence for the conversion of LIPII to Fe-LIP by guaiacol (4Koduri R.S. Tien M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which suggests at least a two-step mechanism for this stage. In this mechanism, rapid equilibrium is ascribed to binding of a substrate molecule to LIPII, and the rate-limiting step is commonly considered as an electron transfer from the bound substrate molecule to LIPII (4Koduri R.S. Tien M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22254-22258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Banci L. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3205-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The present study focused on investigating the kinetics and thermodynamics for the oxidation of substituted phenols by LIP. The working hypothesis was that if electron transfer is the rate-limiting step of the oxidation of substituted phenols by LIPII, then –RTln k or –RTln k cat will depend on the thermodynamic driving force of the reaction according to the Marcus equation (18Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys.

Furthermore, the research also addressed the kinetics and thermodynamics for the oxidation of 1,2-dimethoxyarenes by LIP. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of oxidation of phenolic substrates by LIP and, furthermore, provide support for the presence of two or more binding sites (23Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24Choinowski T. Blodig W. Winterhalter K.H. Piontek K. J. Mol.

Trans. 2001; 29: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and/or alternative binding modes for phenolic substrates and 1,2-dimethoxyarenes. Enzyme Purification—LIP isoenzyme H1 was produced from high nitrogen cultures of P. chrysosporium Burds BKM-F-1767 (27Rothschild N. Hadar Y. Dosoretz C.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 857-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (6Ward G. Hadar Y. Dosoretz C.G. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2001; 29: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme had a Reinheitszahl (A 409/A 280) value >4.0. LIP concentration was determined at 409 nm using an extinction coefficient of 169 mm–1cm–1 (15Tien M. Kirk T.K. Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1687-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activity (units/liter) was assayed according to Tien and Kirk (28Tien M. Kirk T.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 238-249Crossref Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of the stock enzyme solution was calculated to be 2.14 units/nmol of heme protein. The enzyme was extensively dialyzed against double-distilled water before use. Steady State Kinetics Studies—Steady state kinetic studies were conducted with 0.2 μm LIP, substrate (the range varied for different substrates but was generally between 0 and 2000 μm, and at least 7 different concentrations were examined), and 300 μm H2O2 in 50 mm sodium tartrate buffer, pH 3.5. Reactions were stopped after 10 s by adding an equal volume of acetonitrile to inactivate the enzyme and then analyzed by HPLC as described below. The amount of substrate consumed in 10 s (calculated from blanks without H2O2 and authentic compounds) for different initial substrate concentrations was determined. Three replicates of both blanks and reactions were analyzed. Km and k cat were calculated by non-linear least squares fits to plots of the initial rate of oxidation as a function of substrate concentration. Presteady State Kinetics—Presteady state kinetics were studied using an SFA-20 stopped flow apparatus (HI-TECH Scientific, Sussex, UK) attached to a Shimadzu UV-260 spectrophotometer as previously reported (6Ward G. Hadar Y. Dosoretz C.G. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2001; 29: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because of differences in rates between LIPI and LIPII, rate constants for LIPII could be determined from experiments where it was formed from the reaction of LIPI with the substrate (17Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). LIPI was prepared by adding 1 μm H2O2 to 1 μm LIP (4Koduri R.S. Tien M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22254-22258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in one of the syringes of the stopped flow apparatus. One minute after preparation, the pneumatic drive was operated, and LIPI was mixed in the spectrophotometer flow cell with an equal volume of the contents of another syringe containing substrate and buffer. After mixing, reactions contained 0.5 μm LIPI, 50 mm sodium tartrate buffer, pH 3.5, and varying amounts of substrate (0–1000 μm). The conversion of LIPII to Fe-LIP as a function of substrate concentration was monitored at 426 nm, the isosbestic point between Fe-LIP and LIPI (17Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Five replicates of each of at least eight different substrate concentrations were studied. Analogue Studies—Analogue studies were conducted with 0.2 μm LIP, 100 μm substrate, and 300 μm H2O2 in the presence and absence of either 1500 μm veratryl aldehyde or veratric acid. Reactions were stopped after 10 s by adding an equal volume of acetonitrile to inactivate the enzyme and then analyzed by HPLC as described below. The amount of substrate consumed in 10 s was calculated from blanks without H2O2 and authentic compounds. Three replicates of both blanks and reactions were analyzed. The oxidation of each substrate in the presence of veratryl aldehyde or veratric acid is presented as a percent of the oxidation in their absence. HPLC Analysis—HPLC analysis was conducted on a Hewlett Packard HPLC (HP1100 series) equipped with a diode array detector. A Lichrospher 100 RP-18 column (25 cm × 5 mm inner diameter, 5 μm; Merck) was employed for analysis. 3,4-Dihydroxybenzoic acid was analyzed using a mobile phase consisting of component A (1% v/v, acetic acid) and component B (1% v/v acetic acid in 90% v/v methanol) (29Park J.W. Dec J. Kim J.E. Bollag J.M. Environ. Sci. Technol. 1999; 33: 2028-2034Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). All other substrates were analyzed using a mobile phase that consisted of component A (10% v/v, aqueous acetonitrile, 1 mm trifluoroacetic acid) and component B (40% v/v, aqueous methanol, 40%, v/v aqueous acetonitrile, 1 mm trifluoroacetic acid) (30Ward G. Hadar Y. Bilkis I. Konstantinovsky L. Dosoretz C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18734-18741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of each component of the mobile phase varied according to the substrate analyzed. The flow rate in all cases was maintained at 1 ml/min. Quantification was performed by integration of peak areas at 280 nm for all substrates, with reference to calibrations, which were made using known amounts of authentic compounds. Quantum Chemical Calculations—Optimal geometries and heats of formation of the substrates were determined using the restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) AM1 Hamiltonian (31Dewar M.J.S. Zoebish E.G. Healy E.F. Stewart J.J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3902-3909Crossref Scopus (15063) Google Scholar). For radical cations, unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) (high spin contamination was found), and restricted open shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) AM1 Hamiltonians were employed (31Dewar M.J.S. Zoebish E.G. Healy E.F. Stewart J.J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3902-3909Crossref Scopus (15063) Google Scholar). The UHF and ROHF adiabatic ionization potentials (IPad(UHF) and IPad(ROHF), respectively) were calculated as the difference between the heats of formation of the substrates and their radical cations after the optimal geometries were determined. Vertical ionization potentials (IPv(UHF) or IPv(ROHF)) were calculated using the heats of formation of radical cations assuming the geometries of the substrates. All the calculations were performed with the Gaussian 94 (32Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Gill P.M.W. Johnson B.G. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Keith T. Petersson G.A. Montgomery J.A.

Gaussian Inc., Pittsburgh, PA1995Google Scholar) and Spartan 5.1 programs. The difference in the heat of formation of radical cations and parent compounds calculated for aqueous solutions corresponds to the oxidation potential (OP). Chemicals—H2O2 (30% v/v solution) was obtained from Sigma. The concentration of stock solutions of H2O2 was determined at 240 nm using an extinction coefficient of 39.4 m–1 cm–1 (33Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The substrates chosen for this study are given in Table I. Phenolic substrates are given in the upper part of the table and are divided into subfamilies according to their substitution patterns. They are followed by 1,2-dimethoxyarenes in the lower part of the table. All substrates were obtained from Aldrich except for ferulic acid, caffeic acid, catechol, guaiacol, vanillic acid, and syringic acid, which were obtained from Sigma, and veratrole, which was obtained from Fluka (Rehovot, Israel).Table IList of substrates studied Stock solutions of substrates were made in 95% (v/v) ethanol and checked using the extinction coefficients given in Table I. The extinction coefficients were determined by preparing a series of solutions of increasing concentrations for each substrate and measuring the absorbance at the predetermined wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax). All stock solutions were 100 mm except 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid, which was 10 mm. Kinetic Measurements—In the event that the last stage of the well known ping-pong mechanism (Scheme 1) is rate-limiting and controls the overall rate of the catalytic cycle, then steady state kinetic parameters for LIP catalyzed oxidation will be representative of the conversion of LIPII to Fe-LIP in the presence of substrate molecules. According to Segel (34Segel H.M. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley Interscience Publications, New York1975: 727-728Google Scholar), the observed rate (v) for decay of substrate concentration is described by Equation 1, v=2A[H2O2][S]AB[H2O2]+AC[H2O2]+AD[S]+AF[H2O2][S](Eq. 1) where A = k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 k 5 k 6, B = (k –5 + k 6)/k 5 k 6, C = (k –3 + k 4)/k 3 k 4, D= (k –1 + k 2)/k 1 k 2, and E = (k 2 k 4 + k 2 k 6 + k 4 k 6)/k 2 k 4 k 6. The overall reaction rate will be determined by the reactivity of LIPII if k 2 < k –1, k 4 < k –3, k 6 < k –5, and k 6 < k 2 and k 4. In accordance, Equation 1 can be simplified to Equation 2. v=2k6[H2O2][S]k-5[H2O2]/k5+k-3k6[H2O2]/k3k4+(k-1k6/k1k2+[H2O2])[S](Eq. 2) If [H2O2] ≫ k –1/k 1, the Michaelis-Menten-type Equation 3 is obtained. v=2k6[S]k-5/k5+k-3k6/k3k4+[S]=kcat[S]Km+[S](Eq. 3) Presteady kinetics of the conversion of LIPII to Fe-LIP, the last stage in Scheme 1, involves monitoring the change in concentration of LIPII upon reaction with substrate molecules and is depicted in Equation 4. If rapid equilibrium is assumed for the first step, the observed rate of oxidation (v′) can be given by Equation 5, as previously described by Koduri and Tien (4Koduri R.S. Tien M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22254-22258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“39726eq4”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;(Eq. 4) v'=k6[S]k-5/k5+k6/k5+S=k[S]Kd+[S](Eq. 5) If steady state kinetic parameters are representative of the conversion of LIPII to Fe-LIP (i.e. the conversion of LIPII to Fe-LIP is the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle), then according to Equations 3 and 5, it can be expected that k –5/k 5 ≫ k –3 k 6/k 3 k 4, k 6/k 5, and thus, k cat = 2k, and Km = Kd . Steady state kinetic parameters were determined for all of the substituted phenols. Presteady state kinetic parameters were determined for six of them, chosen to cover the entire range of redox potentials of the substrates studied under steady state kinetics conditions. Under steady state conditions, the plots of the initial reaction rate (v) versus substrate concentration were hyperbolic for all of the substituted phenols studied. Non-linear least squares fits were then used to determine Km and k cat, which are presented in Table II. Similarly, the plots of the initial reaction rate (v′) versus substrate concentration for the presteady kinetics of the conversion of LIPII to Fe-LIP were also hyperbolic, in full accordance with Equation 4 and as noticed previously for the conversion of LIPII to Fe-LIP by other substrates (4Koduri R.S. Tien M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22254-22258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Banci L. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Tien M.

The kinetic parameters k and Kd , calculated from Equation 5 using a non-linear least squares fit to the data, are presented in Table II. The average value of k for the 6 substrates, 17 s–1, was similar to the average value of k cat/2 for the same 6 substrates, 16 s–1. The average value of k cat/2 for all of the studied phenols was calculated as 15 s–1. Furthermore, a linear relationship was observed between Kd and Km for the six substrates studied by both approaches (Fig. 1). Because in accordance with Equations 3 and 5, k cat ≅ 2k and Km ∝ Kd , kinetic parameters obtained under steady state conditions can be considered to reflect the reactivity of LIPII, which is thus the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle.Table IIKinetic parameters of substituted phenolsSubstratekcatKmkKds-1μ ms-1μ m2,4-Dibromophenol(4.3 ± 0.2) × 101(3.8 ± 0.6) × 1024-Bromophenol(4.0 ± 0.5) × 101(5.2 ± 1.5) × 102(2.3 ± 0.2) × 101(3.1 ± 0.8) × 1023-Bromophenol(3.0 ± 0.5) × 101(1.3 ± 0.6) × 1032,4-Dichlorophenol(2.3 ± 0.2) × 101(3.3 ± 1.1) × 102(1.6 ± 0.2) × 101(1.4 ± 0.4) × 1024-Chlorophenol(2.2 ± 0.2) × 101(3.2 ± 0.8) × 102(1.5 ± 0.2) × 101(1.9 ± 0.7) × 1023-Chlorophenol(2.7 ± 0.5) × 101(7.9 ± 3.6) × 102Catechol(3.6 ± 0.2) × 101(1.9 ± 0.4) × 102Caffeic acid(3.8 ± 0.3) × 101(2.2 ± 0.4) × 102(1.6 ± 0.1) × 101(2.0 ± 0.6) × 101Protocatechuic acid(2.5 ± 0.3) × 101(4.4 ± 1.3) × 102Ferulic acid(3.8 ± 0.1) × 101(1.0 ± 0.1) × 102(1.6 ± 0.1) × 101(2.8 ± 0.4) × 101Guaiacol(3.8 ± 0.1) × 101(1.7 ± 0.2) × 102Vanillyl alcohol(3.9 ± 0.2) × 101(1.2 ± 0.2) × 102Vanillic acid(1.8 ± 0.1) × 101(1.6 ± 0.4) × 102Syringaldehyde(1.3 ± 0.1) × 101(1.7 ± 0.3) × 1022,6-Dimethoxyphenol(2.7 ± 0.3) × 101(9.7 ± 4.5) × 101(1.5 ± 0.1) × 101(1.3 ± 0.7) × 101Syringic acid(1.0 ± 0.1) × 101(1.1 ± 0.4) × 102 Open table in a new tab Estimation of the Thermodynamic Driving Force of Electron Transfer—To characterize the thermodynamic driving force for the oxidation of substituted phenols by LIPII, the redox potential of both the enzyme intermediate and the substrates must be known. The redox potential of LIPII is estimated to be about 1.15–1.25 V versus normal hydrogen electrode (2Schoemaker H.E. Lundell T.K. Floris R. Glumoff T. Winterhalter K.H. Piontek K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1994; 2: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The redox characteristics of phenols in aqueous solution are dependent on pH. Oxidation of phenolate leads to formation of the corresponding phenoxyl radical (Equation 6). PhO-→PhO·+e(Eq. 6) Redox potentials (E 0(PhO·/PhO–)) of a large number of substituted phenolates have been determined experimentally (35Steenken S. Neta P. J. Phys.

The one-electron oxidation of undissociated phenols is usually described as a dissociative electron transfer (middle reaction in Equation 7) and is characterized by higher redox potentials than for the corresponding phenolates. The redox potential of an undissociated phenol may be calculated using Equation 8 based on the thermodynamic cycle represented in the upper part of Equation 7. When both the undissociated phenol and the phenolate ion are present in aqueous solution, then Equation 9 may be applied to estimate the effective redox potential at a given pH (43Wardman P. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1989; 18: 1637-1755Crossref Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). E0(PhO·+H+/PhOH)=E0(PhO·/PhO-)+0.059pKa(Eq. 7) E0(PhO·+H+/PhOH)=E0(PhO·/PhO-)+0.059(pKa-pH)(Eq. 8) Another way to estimate the redox potential of an undissociated phenol is based on the thermodynamic cycle shown in the bottom part of Equation 7. In this case the redox potential is equal to the sum of bond dissociation energy of the phenol in x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“bc3837471eq8”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;(Eq. 9) eV and the redox potential of the H+ → H. transformation. The experimentally measured redox potentials are known for only some of the phenols studied (Table III). Therefore, a calculated parameter that adequately represents the redox properties of the substrates was sought. Previous studies have relied on three approaches to calculate parameters that describe the reactivity of phenols with HRP (44Sakurada J. Sekiguchi R. Sato K. Hosoya T.

The promoter of the human gene has been analyzed in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, where α9 subunit expression was detected, and in C2C12 cells that do not express α9. A proximal promoter region (from –322 to +113) showed maximal transcriptional activity in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas its activity in C1C12 cells was much lower. Two elements unusually located at the 5′-noncoding region exhibited opposite roles. A negative element located between +15 and +48 appears to be cell-specific because it was effective in C2C12 but not in SH-SY5Y cells, where it was counterbalanced by the presence of the promoter region 5′ to the initiation site. An activating element located between +66 and +79 and formed by two adjacent Sox boxes increased the activity of the α9 promoter about 4-fold and was even able to activate other promoters. This element interacts with Sox proteins, probably through a cooperative mechanism in which the two Sox boxes are necessary. We propose that the Sox complex provides an initial scaffold that facilitates the recruiting of the transcriptional machinery responsible for α9 subunit expression.

Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; HMG, high mobility group; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR. are members of a supergene family of ion channels gated by neurotransmitters (1Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). They are pentameric oligomers composed of related subunits, which are commonly classified as agonist-binding (designated α2–α10) and structural (β2–β4) subunits. Unlike some nAChR subunits that have a relatively broad expression, the α9 subunit has been found only in very restricted areas such as the pituitary pars tuberalis, the olfactory epithelium, and the cochlea (2Elgoyhen A.B. Johnson D.S. Boulter J. Vetter D.E. Heinemann S. Cell. 1994; 79: 705-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 3Simmons D.D. Morley BJ. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 56: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This limited expression could be the consequence of tight mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, which might be of great interest in understanding how the regional and developmental expression of neuronal nAChRs is controlled at the transcriptional level (see Ref. 4Fornasari K.I.

For this reason, here we have analyzed the human α9 promoter, finding that two cis-elements unusually located at the 5′-noncoding region of α9 transcripts control in opposite ways the basal transcriptional activity of the α9 subunit gene. Isolation and Analysis of the 5′-Flanking Sequence of the α9 Subunit—The human α9 coding sequence was obtained by PCR from a human pituitary cDNA library (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) by using the information contained in the GenBank™ sequence AJ243342. A fragment from the 5′-end was used to screen a human genomic library constructed in EMBL-3 SP6/T7 (Clontech) and tested as described previously (5García-Guzmán M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A Stühmer W. Gutiérrez L.M. Criado M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A bacteriophage clone was purified and characterized. It contained ∼4,600 bp of 5′-flanking region and at least the first exon. 5′-RACE Analysis of 5′ mRNA Ends—The 5′-end of α9 mRNA was mapped by 5′-RACE, as primer extension and RNase protection methods did not yield satisfactory results. For this purpose the Marathon Ready cDNA system from Clontech was applied to the previously mentioned cDNA library from human pituitary as indicated by the manufacturer. Two antisense oligonucleotides at the first and second exons (see Fig. 1) were used in parallel assays of DNA amplification. Their sequences were: from position +201 to +180, 5′-CTCAGTCTGGAAGCAGCAAAG-3′; +602 to +578, 5′-CGTAATCTGCAGG-GTCACATTCAGG-3′. The resulting products were cloned and sequenced. RT-PCR Analysis—Poly (A)+ RNA was directly selected from SH-SY5Y cell lysates by oligo(dT)-Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's instructions. α9 subunit transcripts, as well as α7 and β4 transcripts as positive controls, were detected by an RT-PCR assay (Access RT-PCR System from Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, samples of mRNA (200 ng) or in vitro synthesized cRNA (30 ng) in a final volume of 20 μl were reverse transcribed with 2 units of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (45 min at 48 °C), and PCR was further performed for 30 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C) with 2 units of Tfl DNA polymerase. The amplified DNA fragments extended over at least 1 intron or more, to rule out the possibility of amplifying a potential contamination of genomic DNA. Anyway, RT-PCR performed in the absence of AMV reverse transcriptase or RNA did not yield any DNA fragment. A similar analysis was performed with mRNA from C2C12 cells and 35 PCR cycles, and α7 but not α9 transcripts were detected. Plasmid Constructions—All α9 promoter-luciferase gene fusions were made in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega), introducing in its polylinker upstream of the luciferase gene the suitable α9 promoter fragments. These fragments were generated with restriction enzymes and cloned directly into pGL2-Basic or subcloned first in pBluescript and then transferred to pGL2-Basic. Deletion analysis of the most promoter-proximal region was performed by generating either appropriate restriction enzyme fragments or PCR fragments with suitable sense oligonucleotides and an antisense primer (5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCC-3′) that anneals to the pGL2-Basic vector downstream of the site of transcription initiation. Cell Culture and Reporter Assays—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were grown in 90% Eagle's minimal essential medium with Glutamax-1 (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum. C2C12 cells were grown in 85% Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and 15% fetal calf serum. Plasmids were purified by Concert columns (Invitrogen, manufacture discontinued). Both cell types were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure (6Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y (105 cells/well) or C2C12 cells (104 cells/well) on 24-well plates were incubated with 1.5 μg of the different α9 constructs and 1.5 μg of pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences) per well. Cells were harvested after 48 h and lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). β-Galactosidase and luciferase activities were then determined in the lysates with the corresponding assay systems (Promega). Results were expressed as luciferase activity corrected for transfection efficiency as determined by β-galactosidase activity produced by the pCH110 plasmid. To facilitate the comparison of different constructs (Fig. 3) within a specific cell line, we used as reference the activity of a particular construct in that cell line. Direct comparison between the two cells lines was also possible because the construct that we chose as reference (construct [+66/+113]) showed similar activities. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cells as described (7Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Probes were obtained by annealing complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to region +66 to +80 and end-labeled by Klenow filling with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA-protein binding reaction volumes were 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dG-dC)·(dG-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 2 μg of nuclear extract protein, and 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, the labeled probe was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 20 min. For competition studies, the nuclear extract was incubated with the competing oligonucleotide prior to the labeled probe for 20 min. In some experiments purified proteins were used instead of nuclear extracts. The high mobility group (HMG) domain of Sox10 (nucleotides 886–1138) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Wegner (Erlangen University, Germany). The protein was expressed in bacteria and purified as described (8Jain N. Mahendran R. Philp R. Guy R. Tan Y.H. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13530-13536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recombinant Sox9 was obtained by applying the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) to the pcDNA3-HA-Sox9 plasmid, kindly provided by Dr. V. Harley (Prince Henry's Institute, Clayton, Australia). A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus sequence for Sox proteins was used in some experiments. Its sequence was 5′-GGGATCCGCGCCTTTGTTCTCCCCA-3′. Structure of the 5′-Flanking Region of the Human α9 Subunit Gene—The 5′-end of α9 mRNA was mapped by 5′-RACE, as primer extension and RNase protection experiments produced inconsistent results. In 5′-RACE several DNA fragments were detected; their 5′-ends are indicated in Fig. 1 (black arrowheads). These fragments may represent true 5′-ends of the α9 RNA or may just be the result of arrests during reverse transcription. Because the largest fragment was obtained independently several times with two different oligonucleotides, we tentatively considered its 5′-end as the most probable site of transcription initiation. To examine the requirements for α9 subunit transcription, its promoter region was isolated and analyzed. A human genomic library was screened, and mapping of a bacteriophage clone showed the presence of the α9 5′-untranslated region (first exon) and further upstream sequences. A BamHI-HindIII fragment (Fig. 1) containing the first exon and part of the first intron was sequenced. Further comparison of this sequence to a data base of binding sequences of known transcription factors only revealed the lack of a TATA box and the presence of two adjacent Sox protein binding sites with opposite orientations and located 3′ to the transcription initiation site. Additional sites that showed mismatches in regard to perfect consensus sequences were also observed. Functional Analysis of the Human α9 Subunit Promoter—A series of constructs was generated to determine the regions of the α9 subunit promoter that contributed to its maximal activity. We tried to study their transcriptional activity in cells that express α9 subunits, such as human keratinocytes (9Nguyen V.T. Ndoye A. Grando S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1377-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the immortalized cell line UB/OC-2, which was developed from the organ of Corti of the transgenic H-2Kb-tsA58 mouse (10Jagger D.J. Griesinger C.B. Rivolta M.N. Holley M.C. Ashmore J.F. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 49-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Rivolta M.N. Grix N. Lawlor P. Ashmore J.F. Jagger D.J. Holley M.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 265: 1595-1603Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, no satisfactory results were obtained (see “Discussion”). Because the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y express α3, α5, α7, β2, β3, and β4 nAChR subunits (12Groot Kormelink P.J. Luyten W.H.M.L. L W.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we decided to test for the presence of α9 transcripts by an RT-PCR assay. As shown in Fig. 2, α9 transcripts were detected in SH-SY5Y cells. As reaction controls, transcripts corresponding to α7 and β4 subunits were also amplified. Although this assay was not quantitative, it is apparent that α7 transcripts were more abundant than those corresponding to the β4 and α9 subunits. These results suggest that the α9 gene is transcribed in SH-SY5Y cells and, therefore, that this cell line might be considered an adequate model in which to study the transcriptional activity of different α9 promoter constructs. In addition, mouse muscle C2C12 cells, which express the muscle-type nAChR (13Gardner P.D. Heinemann S. Patrick J. Brain Res. 1987; 427: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar) and the neuronal α5 and α7 nAChR subunit transcripts (14Campos-Caro A. Carrasco-Serrano C. Valor L.M. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) but not α9 transcripts (not shown), were used for comparative purposes. Some representative constructs were also tested in pituitary derived GH3 cells, but the results did not differ from those found in C2C12 cells. A construct containing 696 bp of α9 promoter sequence plus 32 bp of 5′-noncoding region was shown to be moderately active in both SH-SY5Y and C2C12 cells (Fig. 3, construct [-696/+32]), whereas a shorter construct with a 3′ deletion of the most proximal promoter region (construct [–696/–317]) showed a substantial decrease in promoter activity. By contrast, a construct containing the same 696 bp of promoter sequence plus 113 bp of 5′-noncoding region (construct [–696/+113]) exhibited a significant increase in luciferase activity of about 4- and 2.5-fold in SH-SY5Y and C2C12 cells, respectively. A further 5′ deletion (construct [–322/+113]) did not modify transcriptional activity. Interestingly, when the luciferase activity of constructs [–696/+113] and [–322/+113] was normalized for transfection efficiency (as determined by β-galactosidase activity) and compared in these two cell lines, it was about 3 times higher in SH-SY5Y cells than in C2C12 cells, which could account, at least in part, for the presence of α9 transcripts in SH-SY5Y but not in C2C12 cells. It is important to notice that the promoter activity of the different constructs was expressed as a percentage of the values obtained with construct [+66/+113], because the activity of the latter was similar in both cell lines, constituting a convenient comparative reference. Moreover, this construct contains elements important for transcription (see Fig. 5). The unexpected increase observed upon adding the 5′-noncoding region, comprising +33 to +113, suggested that it might contain important elements for transcription of the α9 gene, inducing us to explore it in more detail. Thus, the luciferase activity of construct [+15/+113], where the basal promoter region has been removed, was lower (by about 2-fold in regard to construct [–696/+113]) but still significant, indicating that this region might facilitate RNA polymerase action by itself. Moreover, further 5′ deletions gave rise to activity increases in constructs [+34/+113], [+49/+113], and [+66/+113] to reach levels similar to construct [–696/+113]. This was especially dramatic in C2C12 cells, because removing the region comprising +15 to +48 yielded an activity equivalent to that found in SH-SY5Y cells. This fact suggested that some elements (denoted by a filled box in the scheme shown in Fig. 3) in the deleted region could play a negative role on transcription especially in C2C12 cells. Finally, larger deletions (constructs [+76/+113] and [+95/+113]) produced a dramatic decrease in activity, indicating that sequences in the deleted regions, located approximately 60–90 bp upstream of the main start site of transcription, may act as positive elements for transcription of the α9 subunit gene in transient transfection assays. In this region the presence of two Sox boxes (15Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1500-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 16Peirano R.I. Goerich D.E. Riethmacher D. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3198-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (depicted as open boxes in the scheme shown in Fig. 3) in opposite orientations was observed between +66 and +79 (see Fig. 4A). When these two elements were inserted into pGL2-Basic (construct [+66/+80] in Fig. 3), substantial luciferase activity was detected, about 55 and 72% of the maximal activity observed in SH-SY5Y and C2C12, respectively. Therefore they appear to play an important role and were analyzed further (see Fig. 4). Characterization of the Positive Element Present at the 5′-Noncoding Region—A functional analysis of the two Sox boxes was carried out by looking at the effects produced by their mutagenesis in the context of construct [+66/+113] (Fig. 4). Mutation of box 1 resulted in a 76 and 93% decrease in transcriptional activity in SH-SY5Y and C2C12 cells, respectively, close to the activity of constructs with the two boxes deleted (constructs [+76/+113] and [+95/+113] in Fig. 3). Mutation of box 2 produced less severe effects. Therefore, it appears that box 1 plays a more determining role in the transcriptional activity of the α9 subunit promoter than box 2, although both seem necessary for maximal activity and might integrate into a whole synergistic mechanism, as suggested by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments to be described next. DNA fragments carrying the wild-type +66 to +80 promoter region and the corresponding box 1 and box 2 mutants from the previous functional studies were labeled and incubated with increasing amounts of a fusion protein made of the HMG domain of Sox10 and GST. The HMG domain is a highly conserved DNA-binding region present in the Sox family of transcription factors (17Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A retarded band was observed (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–4) when using the wild-type DNA fragment. Its intensity increased with increasing amounts of HMG-GST. By contrast, when the box 2 mutant was used as probe, the intensity of the retarded band was very reduced (Fig. 5A, lanes 5–8). This reduction was even stronger when the box 1 mutant was used as probe (Fig. 5A, lanes 9–12). This finding suggests that the HMG domain of Sox10 is able to recognize the two boxes and that its affinity for them is higher if both are intact. Moreover, the single mutants results indicate that box 1 has higher affinity, in agreement with its predominant role in the previous functional assays (Fig. 4). These results were confirmed by using the complete Sox9 protein (18Clarkson M.J. Harley V.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 106-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with the same labeled probes (Fig. 5B). Again, a retarded band of increasing intensity was observed with increasing amounts of Sox9 protein when using the wild-type probe (Fig. 5B, lanes 13–15), whereas the mutant probes produced a band of reduced intensity, especially when box 1 has been altered (Fig. 5B, lanes 16 and 17). A more complex pattern composed of up to four different bands was observed when nuclear extracts were used, especially from SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 6A, lane 2). The pattern was simplified with C2C12 cell extracts (Fig. 6A, lane 3) and also when the mutant probes were used (lanes 5, 6, 8, and 9). In this case the band with the lower mobility disappeared (denoted as IV in Fig. 6A). A probe containing one consensus site for Sox proteins produced only the band of higher mobility (denoted as I in Fig. 6A), indicating that the bands of lower mobility obtained with the wild-type probe are probably the result of complex interactions involving the two Sox boxes and perhaps protein-protein interactions. Moreover, competition experiments (Fig. 6B) confirmed the specificity of the interactions, also showing that mutant probes (lanes 18–21 and 22–25) were less potent competitors than the wild-type probe (lanes 14–17). Therefore, these results suggest that the positive regulator located in the 5′-noncoding region of the α9 subunit gene is composed of two boxes to which proteins of the Sox family can bind. The identity of these proteins, which compose a family with about 25 members, remains to be elucidated. The Sox Element Can Also Activate Other Promoters—We then asked whether the positive effect of the two Sox boxes on the transcriptional activity of the α9 subunit promoter was operative in other promoters. For this purpose we chose the bovine α7 and the human β4 promoters, which had been characterized previously by us (19Carrasco-Serrano C. Campos-Caro A. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20021-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Valor L.M. Campos-Caro A. Carrasco-Serrano C. Ortiz J.A. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8866-8876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and have different transcriptional requirements. The Sox boxes were located between the luciferase reporter gene and the mentioned promoters, and the activity of the resultant constructs in C2C12 cells was compared with that shown by the corresponding parent constructs. As observed in Fig. 7, the insertion of the Sox element produced an increase in transcriptional activity in both promoters, which was larger (about 5-fold) with the bovine α7 promoter. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Sox element present in the 5′-noncoding region of the α9 subunit gene can cooperate with other promoters acting as transcriptional activator. In this article we describe the characterization of the human nAChR α9 subunit promoter. An early attempt to perform functional assays in cells that express α9 subunits, such as human keratinocytes (9Nguyen V.T. Ndoye A. Grando S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1377-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), failed because of the limited amount of available cells along with the difficulty in finding an efficient and reproducible transfection method. We also tested the immortalized cell line UB/OC-2, which expresses the α9 nAChR (10Jagger D.J. Griesinger C.B. Rivolta M.N. Holley M.C. Ashmore J.F. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 49-54Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar); it was efficiently transfected as indicated by expression of green fluorescent protein under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. However, no luciferase activity was detected when different α9 promoter constructs were tested. The same happened with plasmids pGLControl and pCH110, which should express luciferase and β-galactosidase, respectively, under the control of the SV40 promoter. The reason for the lack of activity of some promoters while others are active is unknown, but it may be related to the way this cell line was established and/or the particular cell culture conditions that are required (11Rivolta M.N. Grix N. Lawlor P. Ashmore J.F. Jagger D.J. Holley M.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 265: 1595-1603Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose as a cell model the SH-SY5Y line, which also expresses α9 transcripts. Thus, the study of 5′ deletions of this promoter (Fig. 3) suggested the existence of three main regions: the typical basal promoter region located 5′ to the transcription initiation site and two other domains, having negative and positive transcriptional effects, which are closely located at the 5′-noncoding region of the first exon. The basal region was more active in SH-SY5Y than in C2C12 cells, and its boundaries could be roughly confined between –316 and +32 bp of the initiation site, because construct [–696/–317] was much less active than construct [–696/+32]. Moreover, constructs [–696/+113] and [–322/+113] produced equivalent results, confirming the relevance of the region close to the initiation site. However, the most striking results were obtained when the region between +15 and +113 was present, especially in SH-SY5Y cells, which we have shown to transcribe the α9 subunit gene. This region, which had transcriptional activity by itself (construct [+15/+113]), although lower than constructs containing the basal promoter region appears to contain two different elements. Thus, 5′ deletions between +15 and +48 produced an increase in transcriptional activity up to maximal levels, suggesting the existence of a negative element in the deleted area. This repression, although partial, was particularly evident in C2C12 cells, because repression was kept even with the larger constructs, which contain the basal promoter region. By contrast, this was not the case in SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that complex interactions at the basal promoter region and the negative element would overcome the effect of the latter in these cells. Interestingly, the graded removal of the repressing effect (compare constructs [+15/+113], [+34/+113], and [+49/+113] in Fig. 3) suggests that the whole region between +15 and +48 is involved in repression. Further 5′ deletions produced a strong decrease in activity, indicating that an activating element exists between +66 and +80. The most remarkable feature in this region was the presence of two sites for Sox proteins located in opposite orientations. These, in fact, are inverted repeats that confer a palindromic structure to the whole complex. Their alteration produced a significant decrease in luciferase activity, especially in site 1 (Fig. 4), which having the perfect consensus sequence for binding of Sox proteins might have higher affinity for them. Moreover, shift assays showed that these sites can bind the HMG domain of Sox10 as well as the complete protein Sox9 (Fig. 5), site 1 again being the one having more affinity for Sox proteins. However, binding is much higher when both sites are intact, suggesting that they constitute a whole symmetrical cooperative entity. This was confirmed with nuclear extracts, in particular the ones from SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 6). They produced a complex pattern of retarded bands in the presence of the probe that has the two Sox boxes intact and a more simplified pattern with the mutants, which is nearly coincident with the one observed using a unique consensus Sox motif as probe. It is possible that the two Sox motifs provide a platform on which a protein complex can be built through protein-protein interactions. In this case the complex with the lower mobility would be the result of these interactions. The identity of the Sox proteins involved in the transcriptional regulation of the α9 subunit gene remains to be elucidated. Some possible candidates could be Sox2/Dichaete, Sox5 and its isoform L-Sox5, Sox6, Sox9, or Sox10, because these proteins are expressed in embryonic structures (neural crest, otic vesicle, etc.; see Ref. 21Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar for a review) producing cell types that express α9 nAChRs later. In this context it is interesting to mention that Sox10 has been found to participate in the transcriptional regulation of the rat α3 and β4 subunit genes (22Liu Q. Melnikova I.N. Hu M. Gardner P.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9747-9755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that mutations of the SOX10 gene leads to combined Waardenburg-Hirschsprung syndrome in humans (23Kuhlbrodt K. Schmidt C. Sock E. Pingault V. Bondurand N. Goossens M. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23033-23038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Classical features of the Waardenburg-Hirschprung syndrome are deafness and pigmentation defects, and interestingly, α9 nAChRs are involved in hearing processes (24Fuchs P. Audiol.

Pathol. 2000; 157: 1377-1391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In any case, it might be difficult to identify which Sox protein is regulating α9 for two reasons: first, because the properties of DNA binding and structural modification (bending) of the HMG domains of different Sox proteins appear to be undistinguishable (26Kamachi Y. Cheah K.S. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and second because of the coexpression of several Sox proteins in the same cell type, which suggests a certain functional redundancy (27Collignon J.

Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). A possible strategy would be to search for proteins that determine the interaction specificity of Sox proteins (26Kamachi Y. Cheah K.S. Kondoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), such as the ones with POU (Pit-1/Oct-1/Oct-2/unc-86) domains. Possible candidates could be Pit-1, involved in determination of the different cellular phenotypes of the anterior pituitary during organogenesis (29Rosenfeld M.G. Briata P. Dasen J. Gleiberman A.S.

Although not common, the presence of transcriptional regulatory elements at the 5′-noncoding region of genes is well documented, ranging from general elements such as the downstream promoter element (32Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) to others more specific (33Yamamoto K. Takeshima H. Hamada K. Nakao M. Kino T. Nishi T. Kochi M. Kuratsu J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 393: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These elements, however, are transcriptional enhancers that depend on their promoter region to exert their function. By contrast, in the case of the α9 subunit, the Sox complex can act as promoter by itself, at least in the conditions used in our transfection studies. This situation recalls the one found in the type I and II promoters of RNA polymerase III, where promoter elements are located within the transcribed region (for a review see Ref. 39Paule M.L. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here transcription factor TFIIIA serves as an adaptor, providing a platform that allows the multi-subunit complex called TFIIIC to be recruited. The primary function of the latter is to recruit TFIIIB, a heterotrimer able to bring the RNA polymerase III to the promoter and position it over the initiation region. In the case of the α9 subunit gene, Sox proteins interacting with the two Sox boxes would provide the initial scaffold that would facilitate further recruiting of the transcriptional machinery. The complex pattern observed in the shift assays performed with SH-SY5Y nuclear extracts would reflect the first steps of this process. Moreover, the activation of the α7 and β4 subunit promoters would indicate that the Sox elements could exert this facilitating function independently of the specific requirements of each promoter.

It has been demonstrated that the protein of 60 kDa sediments at s 020, w = 4.6 S and has the diffusion coefficient D 020,w = 6.7 × 10–7 cm2/s in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5 (similarly to bovine serum albumin of 66 kDa that sediments at s 020,w = 4.4 S and D 020,w =6.0×10–7 cm2/s), indicating its compact globular conformation under these conditions. The microcalorimetry study has shown the presence of a cooperative tertiary structure melting at 90 °C, but with several (probably three) independent cooperative domains. In the presence of 100 mm NaCl the protein becomes more asymmetric (s 020, w = 3.1 S) but does not lose its cooperativity and thermostability, this suggesting just the weakening of interdomain ionic interactions. The compact globular conformation of protein S1 seems to be most likely within the ribosome.

The compact globular conformation of protein S1 seems to be most likely within the ribosome. Ribosomal protein S1 is the largest protein of eubacterial ribosomes. It is an RNA-binding protein involved in retention of mRNA during initiation of translation and, maybe, during elongation (1Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Sorensen M.A. Fricke J. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli protein S1 was reported to include six copies of a motif of about 70 amino acids (the so-called S1 motifs) separated by spacers of 10–15 residues (1Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 3Gribskov M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Bycroft M.

Each of these motifs can be arranged into a five-stranded antiparallel β-barrel resembling the fold of the bacterial cold shock protein (4Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Two N-proximal repeats, however, were found to be rather divergent. At the same time, the N-terminal part of protein S1 was reported to contain the ribosome-binding site of the protein (5Giorginis S. Subramanian A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 141: 393-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas the C-proximal part was claimed to bind mRNA (6Draper D.E. Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 122: 321-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similar motifs were found also in a number of other RNA-binding proteins and positted to form an ancient nucleic acid-binding fold (4Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Physical studies of isolated protein S1 from E. coli showed that the protein in solution manifested a highly extended, noncompact conformation; the data of the sedimentation analysis, small angle x-ray scattering, diffusion coefficient, and intrinsic viscosity measurements, etc., were interpreted in terms of a rod-shaped object of 23 nm in length, which was comparable with the longest dimension of the whole ribosome (1Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 7Laughrea M. Moore P.B. J. Mol.

Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1725-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ribosomal protein S1 has been recently identified in Thermus thermophilus and its gene has been expressed in E. coli (10Shiryaev V.M. Selivanova O.M. Hartsch T. Nazimov I.V. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As the previous physico-chemical studies of E. coli ribosomal protein S1 demonstrated its highly elongated, asymmetric shape in solution, we decided to reinvestigate this matter with the thermophilic homologue of the protein, bearing in mind that the non-compact state of the isolated E. coli protein could be the consequence of its low physical stability. Protein Isolation and Sample Preparation—Recombinant ribosomal protein S1 of T. thermophilus was isolated from the E. coli overproducing strain BL21(DE3)pET21d-tthS1 and purified as described earlier (10Shiryaev V.M. Selivanova O.M. Hartsch T. Nazimov I.V. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The purity and the quality of the protein were checked by the standard gel electrophoresis method according to Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). The protein was stored at 4 °C in the precipitated form in (NH4)2SO4 (10Shiryaev V.M. Selivanova O.M. Hartsch T. Nazimov I.V. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Samples for measurements were prepared by solving the precipitate either in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, or in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, with 100 mm NaCl and subsequent dialysis against the same buffers at room temperature overnight. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation analysis of the protein was performed in a rotor An 60 Ti of the model Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) equipped with ultraviolet optics using double-sector capillary cells at 20 °C, 40,000 rpm, and the protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. The sedimentation and diffusion coefficients were calculated using the XL-A/XL-I Data Analysis software, version 6.03, and were reduced to the standard conditions (i.e. to 20 °C at the viscosity and density of water) (13Schachman H.K. Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1959Google Scholar). Differential Scanning Microcalorimetry—Calorimetric measurements were performed in a precision scanning microcalorimeter SCAL-1 (SCAL Co. Ltd., Pushchino, Russia) (14Senin A.A. Potekhin S.A. Tiktopulo E.I. Filimonov V.V. J. Therm. Anal. Calorimetry. 2000; 62: 153-160Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in glass cells of 0.3-ml capacity at the scanning rate of 1.0 K/min, the excess pressure of 2 atm, and the protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. In special experiments the scanning rate varied from 0.25 to 2.0 K/min. The experimental error for temperature and enthalpy measurements did not exceed 0.2 K and 7%, respectively. Thermodynamic analysis of the excess heat capacity profile was done according to Privalov and Potekhin (15Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The partial specific volumes were accepted to be 0.74 cm3/g. Sedimentation—Sedimentation patterns of the isolated T. thermophilus protein S1 are presented in Fig. 1. The sedimentation coefficient measured at low ionic strength (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5) was determined to be s 020, w = 4.6 S. The diffusion coefficient in this conditions was D 020, w = 6.7 × 10–7 cm2/s. The accuracy of measuring the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients is ±0.2 S and ± 0.2 × 10–7 cm2/s, respectively. Fig. 2A shows the dependence of the logarithms of the sedimentation coefficients on the logarithms of the molecular weights for typical globular proteins with compact structures. The slope of this dependence is equal to 2/3, as it should be for the particles with similar hydration and partial specific volumes, the shape of which does not differ much from a sphere (16Cantor C.R. Schimmel O.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA1980: 605-612Google Scholar). It is seen that the T. thermophilus ribosomal protein S1 lies on this line, together with bovine serum albumin having similar physical characteristics (66 kDa, 4.4 S). Fig. 2B shows the dependence of the logarithms of the diffusion coefficients on the logarithms of the molecular weights for globular proteins. The value of the diffusion coefficient for the T. thermophilus protein S1 falls also on the straight line specific to globular proteins. Thus, under these conditions, the isolated ribosomal protein S1 is compactly folded and can be qualified as a typical globular protein. At the same time, the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients of the protein measured in the presence of 100 mm NaCl with 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5 (ionic strength of about 0.1) were significantly lower, being of s 020, w = 3.1 S and D 020, w = 4.5 × 10–7 cm2/s, respectively. These values lie below the dependences typical of globular proteins (see Fig. 2), indicating that the global conformation of the protein is loosening under the higher ionic strength. At intermediate ionic strengths, the sedimentation coefficient of protein S1 has been shown to change gradually from 4.6 to 3.1 S; thus, at 25 mm NaCl with 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, s 020, w = 3.9 S (data not shown). The presence of Mg2+ in concentrations of 1–10 mm does not affect sedimentation behavior of protein S1. The experimentally determined s 020, w and D 020, w permitted us to calculate the protein molecular mass by the Svedberg equation (16Cantor C.R. Schimmel O.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA1980: 605-612Google Scholar). The calculated values were 65 kDa at the low ionic strength and 66 kDa in the presence of 100 mm NaCl; this satisfactorily agrees with the molecular mass of protein S1 determined from the amino acid sequence (60 kDa) (10Shiryaev V.M. Selivanova O.M. Hartsch T. Nazimov I.V. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, is can be concluded that in both conditions the protein exists as a monomer. Microcalorimetry—Differential scanning calorimetry is a direct test for the presence of a cooperative tertiary structure in a protein molecule (15Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Using this technique the thermodynamic parameters of thermal denaturation of T. thermophilus ribosomal protein S1 in solution were measured (Table I). Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of partial molar heat capacity of the protein both at low (in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5) and moderate (in the presence of 100 mm NaCl) ionic strengths. In both cases intensive heat absorption peaks in a relatively narrow temperature range were displayed this reflecting the cooperative melting of the protein tertiary structure. The protein structure is thermostable in both solutions used: the temperature maxima of the heat absorption peaks for the transition from native to denatured state is 90.0 °C at the low ionic strength and slightly higher (91.5 °C) in the presence of 100 mm salt. The enthalpy of denaturation is also somewhat increased at the higher ionic strength. All this indicates that the observed decrease in the sedimentation coefficient in the presence of salt is not caused by the melting of the tertiary structure and the loss of the globular organization, but rather reflects the weakening of interdomain ionic interactions and drawing the globular domains apart.Table IThermodynamic characteristics of denaturation for protein S1 of T. thermophilusIonic conditionsTm aTemperature of the peak maximum.ΔH calbCalorimetric enthalpy.ΔH effcVan't Hoff enthalpy.

Open table in a new tab The denaturation of the protein is followed by some aggregation eventually resulting in the irreversibility of the process. At the low ionic strength, the high temperature slope of the calorimetric profile is too sharp and cannot be described by any reasonable equilibrium model. This suggests either aggregation or slow kinetics of denaturation to cause noticeable distortions in the melting peak that may lead to a decrease of the denaturation enthalpy. The situation changes at the moderate ionic strength. As seen from the curve, the high temperature slope of the profile shows the absence of the effect of slow kinetics. This allows to evaluate the complexity of the denaturation transition (number of stages) and to apply the equilibrium thermodynamics to the analysis of the calorimetric curves (15Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). From the melting curves of the protein S1 (Fig. 3) the values of calorimetric and effective enthalpies (ΔH cal and ΔH eff) were calculated (Table I). As seen from the table, in the presence of salt the ratio ΔH cal/ΔH eff = 2.7 is observed. This value significantly exceeds the ratio ΔH cal/ΔH eff = 1.0 characteristic of single-domain proteins. Hence, the result obtained gives evidence of the multidomain organization of the protein S1 (15Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The most important result of this study is the demonstration of the principal capability of ribosomal protein S1 to acquire a compact globular conformation. All previous studies of ribosomal protein S1 from E. coli could show only a strongly asymmetric, highly elongated shape of the protein in solution (1Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 7Laughrea M. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 399-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Giri L. Subramanian A.R. FEBS Lett. 1977; 81: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Yokota T. Arai K. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1725-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and based on this many speculations were put forward where this unusual conformation was correlated with suspected functions of the protein on the ribosome, including the role of a lasso for catching mRNA molecules (1Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Odom O.W. Deng H.-Y. Subramanian A.R. Hardesty B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 230: 178-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At the same time, the highly elongated shape of the protein, with the dimension comparable with that of the whole 30 S ribosomal subunit, did not seem to be very realistic for functioning ribosome. Nobody could observe such an elongated body on the ribosomal particle. The electron microscopy study of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of Qβ-infected E. coli cells, where ribosomal protein S1 is included as a subunit, showed very compact, globular shapes of all four subunits of the enzyme (18Berestowskaya N.H. Vasiliev V.D. Volkov A.A. Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting the capability of the protein S1 to be stabilized in the compact conformation upon binding to functional surfaces. Similar situation favorable for acquiring compact conformation for protein S1 on the ribosome surface could not be excluded. After the demonstration of the principal capability of the T. thermophilus protein S1 to be compact in solution, this possibility has become very likely. At the same time, as evidenced from the sedimentation data obtained under different ionic conditions, some parts of protein S1, even in the case of the thermostable protein, are joined together in a loose and week manner, and the links between them are easily destroyed at a moderate ionic strength. According to the thermodynamic data, however, compact globular domains are quite stable and preserved under different ionic and temperature conditions. Moreover, the melting enthalpy increases considerably with the increasing ionic strength, whereas the temperature grows only slightly. The increase of the enthalpy may be caused by hydration of the domain surface exposed upon disruption of interdomain salt bridges at increased ionic strength (19Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). It is also possible that an aggregation of the protein at the low ionic strength leads to underestimating enthalpy. As mentioned above, the situation changes with increasing ionic strength. Special calorimetric experiments demonstrate that, when the rate of heating the T. thermophilus protein S1 in 100 mm NaCl is changed from 0.25 to 2 K/min, the shape of its melting curve does not change (data not shown). This indicates that denaturation in such conditions is an equilibrium process. Therefore in the first approximation it is correct in this case to use the equilibrium thermodynamic analysis (15Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the comparison of the experimental melting curve with the curves calculated for models with a different number of cooperative thermodynamic domains. By definition, a thermodynamic domain is a minimum part of a molecular structure, which can be maintained independently without other parts of the macromolecule. The model analysis allows estimating the number of such domains in the structure of a macromolecule and their relative sizes. On the other hand, the compatibility between a thermodynamic model and an experimental calorimetric curve can be tested (15Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Taking into account the presence of six homologous regions in the sequence of protein S1 (3Gribskov M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we have tried to describe the experimental calorimetric curve by the model which includes the melting of six equal cooperative domains. Additionally, the model of three equal domains was also considered, as each two consecutive homologous regions could fuse into one domain. However as seen from Fig. 4, A and B, both models are not feasible being in conflict with the experimental data. Likewise, the two-domain model based on the knowledge of different functional positions of two parts of the molecule (1Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5Giorginis S. Subramanian A.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 141: 393-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Draper D.E. Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 122: 321-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) cannot describe an experimental curve satisfactorily (Fig. 4C). For further analysis we suggest that domains in the model may be of an arbitrary size. Only the three-domain model allows us to obtain a quite suitable description of the experimental calorimetric curve (Fig. 4D). From the melting enthalpy of the cooperative domains we can estimate their relative size, if it is assumed that the specific melting enthalpy is nearly the same for all domains. As shown in Fig. 4D, one of the domains is twice as large as each of the two others in this case. Attempts to describe the curve by a model with a larger number of domains do not result in a really better description. Thus, the experimental data and the model analysis suggest that protein S1 has a compact molecule structure which is divided into three thermodynamic domains. It can be thought that the six S1 RNA-binding cold-shock-like structural domains of ribosomal protein S1 (4Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) are somehow organized into larger cooperative blocks. We are very grateful to A. A. Timchenko for fruitiful discussions and A. N. Turkin for carrying out the sedimentation experiments."
