Histone-specific antibodies and activated protein C had beneficial effects in animal models of sepsis, pointing to extracellular histones as therapeutics targets for sepsis and other inflammatory conditions ( pages 1245–1246 ). Hyperinflammatory responses can lead to a variety of diseases, including sepsis1. We now report that extracellular histones released in response to inflammatory challenge contribute to endothelial dysfunction, organ failure and death during sepsis. They can be targeted pharmacologically by antibody to histone or by activated protein C (APC). Antibody to histone reduced the mortality of mice in lipopolysaccharide (LPS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or cecal ligation and puncture models of sepsis. Extracellular histones are cytotoxic toward endothelium in vitro and are lethal in mice. In vivo, histone administration resulted in neutrophil margination, vacuolated endothelium, intra-alveolar hemorrhage and macro- and microvascular thrombosis. We detected histone in the circulation of baboons challenged with Escherichia coli, and the increase in histone levels was accompanied by the onset of renal dysfunction. APC cleaves histones and reduces their cytotoxicity. Co-infusion of APC with E. coli in baboons or histones in mice prevented lethality. Blockade of protein C activation exacerbated sublethal LPS challenge into lethality, which was reversed by treatment with antibody to histone. We conclude that extracellular histones are potential molecular targets for therapeutics for sepsis and other inflammatory diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2128213692,"Notch receptor signaling is implicated in controlling smooth muscle cell proliferation and in maintaining smooth muscle cells in an undifferentiated state. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by excessive vascular resistance, smooth muscle cell proliferation in small pulmonary arteries, leading to elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular failure and death. Here we show that human pulmonary hypertension is characterized by overexpression of NOTCH3 in small pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells and that the severity of disease in humans and rodents correlates with the amount of NOTCH3 protein in the lung. We further show that mice with homozygous deletion of Notch3 do not develop pulmonary hypertension in response to hypoxic stimulation and that pulmonary hypertension can be successfully treated in mice by administration of N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a gamma-secretase inhibitor that blocks activation of Notch3 in smooth muscle cells. We show a mechanistic link from NOTCH3 receptor signaling through the Hairy and enhancer of Split-5 (HES-5) protein to smooth muscle cell proliferation and a shift to an undifferentiated smooth muscle cell phenotype. These results suggest that the NOTCH3-HES-5 signaling pathway is crucial for the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension and provide a target pathway for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2075898272,"Most eukaryotic cells have a primary cilium which functions as a sensory organelle. Cilia are assembled by intraflagellar transport (IFT), a process mediated by multimeric IFT particles and molecular motors. Here we show that lymphoid and myeloid cells, which lack primary cilia, express IFT proteins. IFT20, an IFT component essential for ciliary assembly, was found to colocalize with both the microtubule organizing centre (MTOC) and Golgi and post-Golgi compartments in T-lymphocytes. In antigen-specific conjugates, IFT20 translocated to the immune synapse. IFT20 knockdown resulted in impaired T-cell receptor/CD3 (TCR/CD3) clustering and signalling at the immune synapse, due to defective polarized recycling. Moreover, IFT20 was required for the inducible assembly of a complex with other IFT components (IFT57 and IFT88) and the TCR. The results identify IFT20 as a new regulator of immune synapse assembly in T cells and provide the first evidence to implicate IFT in membrane trafficking in cells lacking primary cilia, thereby introducing a new perspective on IFT function beyond its role in ciliogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2125161768,"Viral gene expression can be regulated by chromatin methylation and demethylation. Thomas Kristie and his colleagues have identified a histone demethylase that is required to remove repressive methylation from the immediate early promoters of two α-herpesviruses. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which block this demethylase, prevented lytic replication and reactivation from latency. Reversible methylation of histone tails serves as either a positive signal recognized by transcriptional assemblies or a negative signal that result in repression1,2,3,4. Invading viral pathogens that depend upon the host cell's transcriptional apparatus are also subject to the regulatory impact of chromatin assembly and modifications5,6,7,8. Here we show that infection by the α-herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), results in the rapid accumulation of chromatin bearing repressive histone H3 Lys9 methylation. To enable expression of viral immediate early (IE) genes, both viruses use the cellular transcriptional coactivator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) to recruit the lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) to the viral immediate early promoters. Depletion of LSD1 or inhibition of its activity with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) results in the accumulation of repressive chromatin and a block to viral gene expression. As HCF-1 is a component of the Set1 and MLL1 histone H3 Lys4 methyltransferase complexes9,10, it thus coordinates modulation of repressive H3 Lys9 methylation levels with addition of activating H3 Lys4 trimethylation marks. Strikingly, MAOIs also block the reactivation of HSV from latency in sensory neurons, indicating that the HCF-1 complex is a crucial component of the reactivation mechanism. The results support pharmaceutical control of histone modifying enzymes as a strategy for controlling herpesvirus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2063229389,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) restores equilibrium to the ER, but prolonged expression of the UPR effector CHOP (GADD153) is cytotoxic. We found that CHOP expression induced by ER stress was suppressed by prior engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 or 4 through a TRIF-dependent pathway. TLR engagement did not suppress phosphorylation of PERK or eIF-2alpha, which are upstream of CHOP, but phospho-eIF-2alpha failed to promote translation of the CHOP activator ATF4. In mice subjected to systemic ER stress, pretreatment with low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 ligand, suppressed CHOP expression and apoptosis in splenic macrophages, renal tubule cells and hepatocytes, and prevented renal dysfunction and hepatosteatosis. This protective effect of LPS did not occur in Trif(-/-) mice or in wild-type mice in which CHOP expression was genetically restored. Thus, TRIF-mediated signals from TLRs selectively attenuate translational activation of ATF4 and its downstream target gene CHOP. We speculate that this mechanism evolved to promote survival of TLR-expressing cells that experience prolonged levels of physiological ER stress in the course of the host response to invading pathogens."

This raises the question of why a particular circuit architecture is selected to implement a given cellular process. To investigate this problem, we compared the Bacillus subtilis circuit that regulates differentiation into the competence state to an engineered circuit with an alternative architecture (SynEx) in silico and in vivo. Time-lapse microscopy measurements showed that SynEx cells generated competence dynamics similar to native cells and reconstituted the physiology of differentiation. However, architectural differences between the circuits altered the dynamic distribution of stochastic fluctuations (noise) during circuit operation. This distinction in noise causes functional differences between the circuits by selectively controlling the timing of competence episodes and response of the system to various DNA concentrations. These results reveal a tradeoff between temporal precision and physiological response range that is controlled by distinct noise characteristics of alternative circuit architectures.

These results reveal a tradeoff between temporal precision and physiological response range that is controlled by distinct noise characteristics of alternative circuit architectures. A fundamental problem in biology is explaining what constraints have selected for observed architectures (i.e., topologies) of gene regulatory circuits. Recently, genetic circuits with different connectivity maps have been shown to generate similar dynamics and function (Alon, 2007Alon U. Network motifs: theory and experimental approaches.Nat. Rev.

This raises the important question as to why particular circuit topologies are present in cells when the same function can supposedly be obtained from alternative architectures. Experimental investigation of this problem is challenging because biological circuits are typically comprised of many components, some unknown, and control physiological processes that are not fully understood, complex in behavior, and difficult to measure quantitatively. Differentiation of B. subtilis cells into the competence state represents an ideal model system to study this problem because the underlying genetic circuit and its biological function are relatively simple and well characterized (Dubnau, 1999Dubnau D. DNA uptake in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, Grossman, 1995Grossman A.D. Genetic networks controlling the initiation of sporulation and the development of genetic competence in Bacillus subtilis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 477-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Additionally, standard tools for genetic manipulation of B. subtilis permit the construction of alternative genetic circuits to probe the functional importance of the native competence circuit architecture. Under environmental stress, a small fraction of B. subtilis cells transiently differentiate into the state of competence, in which they are capable of taking up extracellular DNA and incorporating it into their chromosome (Dubnau, 1999Dubnau D. DNA uptake in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, Grossman, 1995Grossman A.D. Genetic networks controlling the initiation of sporulation and the development of genetic competence in Bacillus subtilis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 477-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Differentiation into competence is regulated by a relatively simple core circuit (Figure 1A). At the heart of the circuit is the transcription factor ComK, which is necessary and sufficient to trigger competence and controls the expression of over 140 genes (Berka et al., 2002Berka R.M. Hahn J. Albano M. Draskovic I. Persuh M. Cui X. Sloma A. Widner W. Dubnau D. Microarray analysis of the Bacillus subtilis K-state: genome-wide expression changes dependent on ComK.Mol.

Exit from competence occurs via a negative feedback loop in which ComK indirectly represses the expression of its activator ComS (Hahn et al., 1994Hahn J. Kong L. Dubnau D.

Cell-cell communication under environmental stress conditions induces expression of ComS, which in turn favors build up of ComK concentration by competitively interfering with the proteoltyic degradation of ComK (Magnuson et al., 1994Magnuson R.

Competence in Bacillus subtilis is controlled by regulated proteolysis of a transcription factor.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6730-6738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repression of ComS expression during competence increases ComK degradation and thus permits exit from competence (Smits et al., 2007Smits W.K. Bongiorni C. Veening J.W. Hamoen L.W. Kuipers O.P.

Together, the interacting positive and negative feedback loops constitute a noise-driven excitable system, which in response to small threshold-crossing perturbations generates a large-amplitude transient response (Figure 1B) (Maamar et al., 2007Maamar H. Raj A. Dubnau D. Noise in gene expression determines cell fate in Bacillus subtilis.Science. 2007; 317: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, Süel et al., 2006Süel G.M. Garcia-Ojalvo J.

Dworkin J. Garcia-Ojalvo J. Elowitz M.B. Tunability and noise dependence in differentiation dynamics.Science. 2007; 315: 1716-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). A crucial aspect of competence is the negative feedback loop in which ComK indirectly stimulates its own degradation, permitting cells to exit the competent state (Ogura et al., 1999Ogura M. Liu L. Lacelle M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Mutational analysis of ComS: evidence for the interaction of ComS and MecA in the regulation of competence development in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Turgay et al., 1998Turgay K. Hahn J. Burghoorn J. Dubnau D. Competence in Bacillus subtilis is controlled by regulated proteolysis of a transcription factor.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6730-6738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The architecture of this negative feedback loop is not the only one that supports excitable dynamics. Genetic oscillators such as the circadian clock are based on genetic circuits that differ in topology, but are also capable of generating excitable dynamics (Turcotte et al., 2008Turcotte M. Garcia-Ojalvo J. Süel G.M. A genetic timer through noise-induced stabilization of an unstable state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 15732-15737Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This raises two general questions: First, what design tradeoffs exist between alternative excitable circuit architectures? Second, what other capabilities besides excitability, per se, does the native architecture provide to the system? In order to address these questions, we constructed a physiologically functional synthetic differentiation circuit (SynEx) with an alternative architecture (Figure 1C). This allowed us to systematically compare competence circuits with different topologies in vivo. Mathematical modeling and quantitative measurements at the single-cell level of the native and synthetic circuits revealed that the architecture of the native competence circuit generates higher variability in the duration of competence episodes. This variability in circuit dynamics at the cellular level determines the range of environmental conditions at the population level to which the competence system can respond. These results suggest that environmental constraints can select for specific architectures of gene regulatory circuits, based on noise in circuit dynamics. An alternative to the native competence circuit was designed by interchanging the inhibitory and activating interactions comprising the negative feedback loop (compare Figures 1A and 1C). Whereas in the native circuit, ComK represses its activator ComS, in the alternative SynEx circuit, ComK induces expression of the protein responsible for its degradation, MecA. Therefore, exit from competence in SynEx is achieved by expression of the inhibitor MecA, rather than repression of the activator ComS. The SynEx negative feedback loop topology, where a repressor is activated, is also a shared feature of genetic oscillators (see Figure S17 available online). In order to compare the potential behaviors of the native and SynEx circuits, we first constructed differential equation models of both circuits (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures [S1.1.1, S1.2.1]). These models serve as frameworks for data analysis and tools for hypothesis generation. A critical advantage is that the ComK positive feedback loop is identical between the native and SynEx circuits, allowing specific comparison between the two negative feedback architectures. Simulations showed that similar to the native circuit, SynEx can also access a regime of excitable dynamics. Therefore, both circuits are predicted to generate transient pulses of ComK with similar frequency, duration and amplitude (Figures 1B and 1D). Due to the different negative feedback loop architectures, ComS concentration in the native circuit is negatively correlated with ComK concentration, while MecA in the SynEx circuit is positively correlated with ComK (Figures 1B and 1D). Despite this difference in correlations, the dynamics of ComK in the native and SynEx circuits are similar in continuous simulations. To test these predictions in vivo, we constructed the SynEx circuit in B. subtilis and compared its behavior with that of the native circuit. We first deleted the native ComS-mediated negative feedback loop by knocking out the comS gene. An isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible promoter expressing ComS was then introduced chromosomally to control the probability of competence events (Quisel et al., 2001Quisel J.D. Burkholder W.F. Grossman A.D. In vivo effects of sporulation kinases on mutant Spo0A proteins in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6573-6578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Expression of ComS in these cells was therefore no longer influenced by ComK dynamics (see Figure S10). As expected in this strain without the native ComS-mediated negative feedback loop, cells that entered competence were unable to exit (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures [S2.8]). Next, we introduced the alternative SynEx negative feedback loop. We placed the mecA gene under the control of the ComK-specific comG promoter (PcomG) and inserted this construct into the B. subtilis chromosome (Hamoen et al., 1998Hamoen L.W. Van Werkhoven A.F. Bijlsma J.J. Dubnau D. Venema G. The competence transcription factor of Bacillus subtilis recognizes short A/T-rich sequences arranged in a unique, flexible pattern along the DNA helix.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). During competence, high concentrations of ComK result in transcriptional activation of MecA, which in turn targets ComK for degradation, permitting cells to exit competence. Mathematical modeling was utilized as a guide to tune and optimize the SynEx circuit in vivo. For example, simulations showed that high affinity of the PcomG promoter for binding ComK would prevent excitable dynamics, because expression of PcomG-mecA at low ComK concentrations would inhibit activation of the ComK positive feedback loop and thus preclude competence. Consistent with these theoretical results, we observed competence in vivo only after introducing a point mutation in the PcomG promoter that reduced affinity for ComK binding (Susanna et al., 2007Susanna K.A. Mironczuk A.M. Smits W.K. Hamoen L.W. Kuipers O.P. A single, specific thymine mutation in the ComK-binding site severely decreases binding and transcription activation by the competence transcription factor ComK of Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4718-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures [S2.4]). We experimentally tested the ability of the engineered SynEx circuit to generate excitable competence dynamics and functionally substitute for the native circuit. Accordingly, we measured native and SynEx circuit dynamics at the single-cell level through quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy (Figures 2A and 2B). Select sample pulses of the competence reporter PcomG-cfp activity observed in SynEx cells appeared to be similar in shape and amplitude to those seen in native cells (Figures 2C and 2D). To enable direct comparison, we tuned the SynEx circuit (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures [S2.4]) to have the same frequency of cells that access the competence state (defined by PcomG-cfp reporter activity) as the natural system (4% ± 0.6% in SynEx and 3.6% ± 0.7% in native cells) (Figure 2E). These results indicate that, as predicted mathematically, the SynEx circuit generates excitable dynamics with similar shape and frequency compared to the native competence circuit. Despite similarities in the single-cell dynamics of native and SynEx circuits, the two strains also displayed several differences. First, the cell-cell variability of competence durations was distinct between native and SynEx (Figure 3A). Specifically, the distribution of duration times of the native circuit was broader than that of the SynEx circuit (Figure 3B). Therefore, the SynEx circuit was twice as precise compared to native with coefficients of variation (noise) of 0.26 (n = 77) and 0.51 (n = 91), respectively (Figure 3C). Second, the median duration of competence events differed between the two circuits (Figure 3D). Native competence events lasted approximately twice as long as their SynEx counterparts (15 hr versus 7 hr, respectively). Third, while SynEx cells were able to reconstitute the physiological function of competence, they did so with a reduced efficiency (Figure 3E). Transformation assays showed that native cells had a 6-fold higher efficiency than cells with the SynEx circuit in taking up extracellular DNA and incorporating it into their chromosome. These results provoke the following questions regarding the observed differences between the two circuits: First, what about the circuits accounts for the difference in cell-cell variability between native and SynEx competence durations? Second, are shorter SynEx competence events responsible for the reduced transformation efficiency? Third, does the variability of competence durations play a functional role? We systematically investigated these differences to obtain insight into the relationship between competence circuit architecture, dynamics and function. To identify the source of the difference in precision between the SynEx and native circuit dynamics, we constructed discrete stochastic models of the native and SynEx circuits to account for intrinsic noise of biochemical reactions and simulated them using the Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie, 1977Gillespie D.T. Exact stochastic simulations of coupled chemical reactions.J. Phys. Chem. 1977; 81: 2340Crossref Scopus (6733) Google Scholar) (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures [S1.1.2 and S.1.2.3]). In both the native and SynEx circuits, the concentration of ComK during competence events is similarly high and therefore does not contribute to differences in stochastic fluctuations between the two circuits (Figures 4A and 4B). However, ComS expression during competence in the native circuit is repressed, and its concentration drops to a few molecules per cell, thus becoming subject to high-amplitude stochastic fluctuations relative to its mean concentration (Figure 4A). In contrast, the concentration of MecA in the SynEx circuit is positively correlated with ComK and thus remains high and relatively less subject to noise during competence (Figure 4B). These stochastic simulations suggest that the opposite regulatory modes of repressing an activator (ComS) versus activating an inhibitor (MecA) contributed to the variation in precision between the native and SynEx circuits, respectively. To further study the noise behavior of native and SynEx circuits, we numerically tested perturbations to biochemical parameters designed to alter the level of fluctuations in ComS and MecA, respectively. For example, to reduce noise in ComS and MecA, we increased expression rates of their respective promoters and compensated for this difference by lowering their binding affinities by a similar fold change. We refer to this combination of compensating parameter changes as the “noise scaling factor” (Figure 4C). Together, these perturbations increased the molecule numbers of ComS and MecA without changing their mean activity and dynamics. Variability in competence durations of native and SynEx circuits was observed to depend on fluctuations in ComS and MecA concentrations, respectively, which could be controlled by the noise scaling factor (see color coding of data points in Figure 4C). However, the two circuits exhibited distinct trends in terms of peak ComK amplitudes, defined here as the probability, P, for generating successful competence events (Figure 4C). Specifically, in the SynEx circuit, increased variability in competence duration comes at the cost of a much higher variability in ComK pulse amplitudes than in the native circuit (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures [S1.3] and Figure S7). Such variability in amplitude interferes with the ability of ComK to cross the putative competence threshold in a reliable manner. Consequently, the probability P of the SynEx circuit to generate successful competence events is reduced with increasing variability of competence durations (Figure 4C). In contrast, in the native circuit P is less sensitive to changes in duration noise (Figure 4C). Therefore, the SynEx circuit seems to be unable to generate high variability in competence durations without loss of competence function, in contrast to the native circuit. Similarly, a more general global parameter analysis showed that random variation of all parameters of the native and SynEx circuits also generates distinct noise profiles for each circuit architecture (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures [S1.4]). Next, we experimentally tested the hypothesis that low molecule numbers of ComS during native competence events give rise to variability in durations. To that end, we constructed a WeakS strain in which we introduced two compensating perturbations to ComS, corresponding to those described in the preceding paragraph, such that twice the number of ComS molecules was required to maintain its mean cellular activity (Figure 4D). Specifically, native ComS was replaced with two copies of a mutated version of ComS shown to have 50% reduced affinity to the proteolytic degradation complex that targets ComK (Ogura et al., 1999Ogura M. Liu L. Lacelle M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Mutational analysis of ComS: evidence for the interaction of ComS and MecA in the regulation of competence development in Bacillus subtilis.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The number of ComS molecules during WeakS competence events was therefore expected to be twice as high compared to native cells. Consequently, variability in WeakS competence duration times was predicted theoretically to be lower than native (Figure 4F, inset). We measured competence dynamics in WeakS cells and observed that noise in competence durations was indeed reduced by 39% (coefficient of variation [CV] = 0.31, n = 40) compared to native (Figures 4E and 4F). Similarly, a strain in which both copy number and degradation of ComS were increased (HighS) exhibited a 25% reduction (CV = 0.39, n = 38) in the variability of competence durations (see SOM S2.6). These data are consistent with simulations and together suggest that high ComS noise during competence, due to low molecule numbers, is the main source of variability in competence durations for native cells. Both SynEx and WeakS strains exhibited shorter mean duration times and reduced transformation efficiency compared to native (Figure 4G). These data suggested that mean duration times of competence may determine the absolute efficiency of DNA uptake during competence. However, although the frequency of competence events in the SynEx circuit was similar to native, it was lower in the WeakS strain (0.5% ± 0.2%, compared to 4% ± 0.6% in SynEx and 3.6% ± 0.7% in native). This difference hindered a direct test of the relationship between mean competence durations and absolute transformation efficiency. Therefore, to experimentally investigate the relationship between mean competence durations and transformation efficiency, we constructed an additional B. subtilis strain (SynExSlow) similar in topology to SynEx but capable of generating mean competence durations equivalent to native cells (Figure 5A). We engineered the SynExSlow strain by modifying the SynEx circuit to generate longer mean competence duration times in accordance with predictions from simulations (Figure 5B). In particular, we reduced the efficiency of the MecA-mediated negative feedback loop to delay exit from competence. This was accomplished by competitively interfering with the proteolytic degradation of ComK by MecA during competence and thus extending competence durations (Figures 5C and 5D, and see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures [S2.7]). A comparative analysis of native, SynEx, and SynExSlow strains could therefore distinguish the physiological advantages of longer mean competence durations observed in native cells. The SynExSlow strain produced mean competence durations and absolute transformation efficiency equivalent to native. As anticipated, SynExSlow competence events occurred at a frequency (3.2% ± 0.4%) that was similar to SynEx and native strains (Figure 5E). In contrast to SynEx, however, the median duration of SynExSlow competence events was similar to native (Figure 5F). The transformation efficiency of the SynExSlow strain was also similar to native for extracellular DNA concentrations ≥1 μg/ml (Figure 5G). These results suggested that longer mean durations of competence events increase the absolute efficiency of transformations, thus explaining the lower transformation efficiency of the SynEx strain. Despite similar mean competence durations and transformation efficiency, SynExSlow cells differed from their native counterparts in the variability of competence durations (Figure 5H). SynExSlow competence durations did not include very short or long episodes observed in native cells and thus exhibited less noise in competence durations (CV = 0.27, n = 65) (Figures 5C and 5D). Although SynEx and SynExSlow strains have distinct transformation efficiency and mean competence durations, both circuits displayed similar noise in competence durations (0.26 and 0.27, respectively) (Figure 5H). These results show that competence circuits that share the SynEx negative feedback loop architecture also display similar low noise in durations even if they differ in other competence properties. The SynExSlow strain was therefore equivalent to native in all properties except for variability in competence durations and thus provided the opportunity to exclusively investigate the functional importance of noise in competence durations. We investigated whether higher noise in native competence durations provides a functional advantage that is distinct from that of longer mean durations. The biological function of competence is to take up and incorporate extracellular DNA into the chromosome of B. subtilis cells (Dubnau, 1999Dubnau D. DNA uptake in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 217-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) One possible model to predict the probability of DNA uptake (transformation efficiency) is based on comparing two characteristic times: (1) the diffusion time for cells to encounter DNA in the extracellular medium, which is inversely proportional to extracellular DNA concentration, and (2) the duration of competence (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures [S1.6]). Longer durations of competence can increase the probability of DNA uptake, but may be deleterious since competent cells have been experimentally shown to exhibit a reduced growth rate (Haijema et al., 2001Haijema B.J. Hahn J. Haynes J. Dubnau D. A ComGA-dependent checkpoint limits growth during the escape from competence.Mol.

An excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation.Nature. 2006; 440: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Given unpredictability in extracellular DNA concentrations, optimization of this cost-benefit problem may give rise to variability in competence duration times (Acar et al., 2008Acar M.

https://openalex.org/W2056829254,"Slit-Roundabout (Robo) signalling has a well-understood role in axon guidance. Unlike in the nervous system, however, Slit-dependent activation of an endothelial-specific Robo, Robo4, does not initiate a guidance program. Instead, Robo4 maintains the barrier function of the mature vascular network by inhibiting neovascular tuft formation and endothelial hyperpermeability induced by pro-angiogenic factors. In this study, we used cell biological and biochemical techniques to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the maintenance of vascular stability by Robo4. Here, we demonstrate that Robo4 mediates Slit2-dependent suppression of cellular protrusive activity through direct interaction with the intracellular adaptor protein paxillin and its paralogue, Hic-5. Formation of a Robo4-paxillin complex at the cell surface blocks activation of the small GTPase Arf6 and, consequently, Rac by recruitment of Arf-GAPs (ADP-ribosylation factor- directed GTPase-activating proteins) such as GIT1. Consistent with these in vitro studies, inhibition of Arf6 activity in vivo phenocopies Robo4 activation by reducing pathologic angiogenesis in choroidal and retinal vascular disease and VEGF-165 (vascular endothelial growth factor-165)-induced retinal hyperpermeability. These data reveal that a Slit2-Robo4-paxillin-GIT1 network inhibits the cellular protrusive activity underlying neovascularization and vascular leak, and identify a new therapeutic target for ameliorating diseases involving the vascular system."
https://openalex.org/W1977828694,"Genes mutated in congenital malformation syndromes are frequently implicated in oncogenesis, but the causative germline and somatic mutations occur in separate cells at different times of an organism's life. Here we unify these processes to a single cellular event for mutations arising in male germ cells that show a paternal age effect. Screening of 30 spermatocytic seminomas for oncogenic mutations in 17 genes identified 2 mutations in FGFR3 (both 1948A>G, encoding K650E, which causes thanatophoric dysplasia in the germline) and 5 mutations in HRAS. Massively parallel sequencing of sperm DNA showed that levels of the FGFR3 mutation increase with paternal age and that the mutation spectrum at the Lys650 codon is similar to that observed in bladder cancer. Most spermatocytic seminomas show increased immunoreactivity for FGFR3 and/or HRAS. We propose that paternal age-effect mutations activate a common 'selfish' pathway supporting proliferation in the testis, leading to diverse phenotypes in the next generation including fetal lethality, congenital syndromes and cancer predisposition."

To decipher p450 activities, Veith et al. screen ∼17,000 compounds, including >1,000 FDA-approved drugs, against five important P450 isozymes and identify chemical structures that are enriched in compounds active against specific isozymes. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene family catalyzes drug metabolism and bioactivation and is therefore relevant to drug development. We determined potency values for 17,143 compounds against five recombinant CYP isozymes (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4) using an in vitro bioluminescent assay. The compounds included libraries of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and screening libraries. We observed cross-library isozyme inhibition (30–78%) with important differences between libraries. Whereas only 7% of the typical screening library was inactive against all five isozymes, 33% of FDA-approved drugs were inactive, reflecting the optimized pharmacological properties of the latter. Our results suggest that low CYP 2C isozyme activity is a common property of drugs, whereas other isozymes, such as CYP 2D6, show little discrimination between drugs and unoptimized compounds found in screening libraries. We also identified chemical substructures that differentiated between the five isozymes. The pharmacological compendium described here should further the understanding of CYP isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W2023913137,"Plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) are localized at the fast-growing, or plus end, of microtubules, and link microtubule ends to cellular structures. One of the best studied +TIPs is EB1, which forms comet-like structures at the tips of growing microtubules. The molecular mechanisms by which EB1 recognizes and tracks growing microtubule ends are largely unknown. However, one clue is that EB1 can bind directly to a microtubule end in the absence of other proteins. Here we use an in vitro assay for dynamic microtubule growth with two-color total-internal-reflection-fluorescence imaging to investigate binding of mammalian EB1 to both stabilized and dynamic microtubules. We find that under conditions of microtubule growth, EB1 not only tip tracks, as previously shown, but also preferentially recognizes the GMPCPP microtubule lattice as opposed to the GDP lattice. The interaction of EB1 with the GMPCPP microtubule lattice depends on the E-hook of tubulin, as well as the amount of salt in solution. The ability to distinguish different nucleotide states of tubulin in microtubule lattice may contribute to the end-tracking mechanism of EB1."
https://openalex.org/W2020377899,"SK1 (sphingosine kinase 1) plays an important role in many aspects of cellular regulation. Most notably, elevated cellular SK1 activity leads to increased cell proliferation, protection from apoptosis, and induction of neoplastic transformation. We have previously shown that translocation of SK1 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane is integral for oncogenesis mediated by this enzyme. The molecular mechanism mediating this translocation of SK1 has remained undefined. Here, we demonstrate a direct role for CIB1 (calcium and integrin-binding protein 1) in this process. We show that CIB1 interacts with SK1 in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner at the previously identified ""calmodulin-binding site"" of SK1. We also demonstrate that CIB1 functions as a Ca(2+)-myristoyl switch, providing a mechanism whereby it translocates SK1 to the plasma membrane. Both small interfering RNA knockdown of CIB1 and the use of a dominant-negative CIB1 we have generated prevent the agonist-dependent translocation of SK1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the requirement of CIB1-mediated translocation of SK1 in controlling cellular sphingosine 1-phosphate generation and associated anti-apoptotic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2062392960,Most animals display multiple behavioral states and control the time allocation to each of their activity phases depending on their environment. Here we develop a new quantitative method to analyze Caenorhabditis elegans behavioral states. We show that the dwelling and roaming two-state behavior of C. elegans is tightly controlled by the concentration of food in the environment of the animal. Sensory perception through the amphid neurons is necessary to extend roaming phases while internal metabolic perception of food nutritional value is needed to induce dwelling. Our analysis also shows that the proportion of time spent in each state is modulated by past nutritional experiences of the animal. This two-state behavior is regulated through serotonin as well as insulin and TGF-beta signaling pathways. We propose a model where food nutritional value is assessed through internal metabolic signaling. Biogenic amines signaling could allow the worm to adapt to fast changes in the environment when peptide transcriptional pathways may mediate slower adaptive changes.
https://openalex.org/W2048358455,"Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (HSPGs) bind to multiple growth factors/morphogens and regulate their signaling. 6-O-sulfation (6S) of glucosamine within HS chains is critical for many of these ligand interactions. Sulf-1 and Sulf-2, which are extracellular neutral-pH sulfatases, provide a novel post-synthetic mechanism for regulation of HSPG function by removing 6S from intact HS chains. The Sulfs can thereby modulate several signaling pathways, including the promotion of Wnt signaling. We found induction of SULF2 transcripts and Sulf-2 protein in human lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, the two major classes of non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We confirmed widespread Sulf-2 protein expression in tumor cells of 10/10 surgical specimens of human lung squamous carcinomas. We studied five Sulf-2+ NSCLC cell lines, including two, which were derived by cigarette-smoke transformation of bronchial epithelial cells. shRNA-mediated Sulf-2 knockdown in these lines caused an increase in 6S on their cell surface and in parallel reversed their transformed phenotype in vitro, eliminated autocrine Wnt signaling and strongly blunted xenograft tumor formation in nude mice. Conversely, forced Sulf-2 expression in non-malignant bronchial epithelial cells produced a partially transformed phenotype. Our findings support an essential role for Sulf-2 in lung cancer, the leading cancer killer."
https://openalex.org/W2042834806,"Background Staphylococci belong to the most important pathogens causing implant-associated infections. Colonization of the implanted medical devices by the formation of a three-dimensional structure made of bacteria and host material called biofilm is considered the most critical factor in these infections. To form a biofilm, bacteria first attach to the surface of the medical device, and then proliferate and accumulate into multilayered cell clusters. Biofilm accumulation may be mediated by polysaccharide and protein factors. Methology/Principal Findings The information on Staphylococcus aureus protein factors involved in biofilm accumulation is limited, therefore, we searched the S. aureus Col genome for LPXTG-motif containing potential surface proteins and chose the so far uncharacterized S. aureus surface protein C (SasC) for further investigation. The deduced SasC sequence consists of 2186 amino acids with a molecular mass of 238 kDa and has features typical of Gram-positive surface proteins, such as an N-terminal signal peptide, a C-terminal LPXTG cell wall anchorage motif, and a repeat region consisting of 17 repeats similar to the domain of unknown function 1542 (DUF1542). We heterologously expressed sasC in Staphylococcus carnosus, which led to the formation of huge cell aggregates indicative of intercellular adhesion and biofilm accumulation. To localize the domain conferring cell aggregation, we expressed two subclones of sasC encoding either the N-terminal domain including a motif that is found in various architectures (FIVAR) or 8 of the DUF1542 repeats. SasC or its N-terminal domain, but not the DUF1542 repeat region conferred production of huge cell aggregates, higher attachment to polystyrene, and enhanced biofilm formation to S. carnosus and S. aureus. SasC does not mediate binding to fibrinogen, thrombospondin-1, von Willebrand factor, or platelets as determined by flow cytometry. Conclusions/Significance Thus, SasC represents a novel S. aureus protein factor involved in cell aggregation and biofilm formation, which may play an important role in colonization during infection with this important pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2016531821,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) induce not only bone formation in vivo but also osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal cells in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) inhibits both osteoblast differentiation and bone formation induced by BMPs. However, the molecular mechanisms of these inhibitions remain unknown. In this study, we found that TNFalpha inhibited the alkaline phosphatase activity and markedly reduced BMP2- and Smad-induced reporter activity in MC3T3-E1 cells. TNFalpha had no effect on the phosphorylation of Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 or on the nuclear translocation of the Smad1-Smad4 complex. In p65-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, overexpression of p65, a subunit of NF-kappaB, inhibited BMP2- and Smad-induced reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, this p65-mediated inhibition of BMP2- and Smad-responsive promoter activity was restored after inhibition of NF-kappaB by the overexpression of the dominant negative IkappaBalpha. Although TNFalpha failed to affect receptor-dependent formation of the Smad1-Smad4 complex, p65 associated with the complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis mobility shift assays revealed that TNFalpha suppressed the DNA binding of Smad proteins to the target gene. Importantly, the specific NF-kappaB inhibitor, BAY11-7082, abolished these phenomena. These results suggest that TNFalpha inhibits BMP signaling by interfering with the DNA binding of Smads through the activation of NF-kappaB."
https://openalex.org/W2028758423,"Background Several studies have implicated viral infection as an important factor in the pathogenesis of IPF and related fibrotic lung disorders. Viruses are thought to cause epithelial cell injury and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process whereby differentiated epithelial cells undergo transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, and considered a source of fibroblasts in the setting of lung injury. We have demonstrated an association between the epithelial injury caused by chronic herpes virus infection with the murine γ-herpes virus, MHV68, and lung fibrosis. We hypothesize that EMT in this model of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis is driven by the expression of the transcription factor Twist. Methods/Findings In vitro MHV68 infection of murine lung epithelial cells induced expression of Twist, and mesenchymal markers. Stable overexpression of Twist promoted EMT in MLE15 lung epithelial cells. Transient knockdown expression of Twist resulted in preservation of epithelial phenotype after in vitro MHV68 infection. In concordance, high expression of Twist was found in lung epithelial cells of MHV68 infected mice, but not in mock infected mice. Alveolar epithelial cells from lung tissue of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients were strongly positive for Twist. These cells demonstrated features of EMT with low expression of E-cadherin and upregulation of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin. Finally, IPF tissue with high Twist protein levels was also positive for the herpesvirus, EBV. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that Twist contributes to EMT in the model of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We speculate that in some IPF cases, γ-herpes virus infection with EBV might be a source of injury precipitating EMT through the expression of Twist."
https://openalex.org/W2096721687,"The anti-HER2 antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) has been proven to be effective in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer; resistance, however, invariably emerges in metastatic tumors. The expression of p95-HER2, a form of HER2 with a truncated extracellular domain that lacks the Trastuzumab binding epitope, has been implicated as a mechanism of resistance to the antibody. We utilized an in vivo tumor model that overexpresses p95-HER2 and showed it to be resistant to the signaling and antitumor effects of Trastuzumab. We find that both full-length and p95-HER2 interact with the HSP90 chaperone protein and are degraded in tumor cells exposed to HSP90 inhibitors in tissue culture and in vivo. Loss of expression of p95-HER2 is accompanied by downregulation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways and inhibition of cell proliferation. Chronic administration of HSP90 inhibitors in vivo results in sustained loss of HER2 and p95-HER2 expression and inhibition of AKT activation, together with induction of apoptosis and complete inhibition of tumor growth in Trastuzumab-resistant, p95-HER2-overexpressing models. Thus, p95-HER2 is an HSP90 client protein, the expression and function of which can be effectively suppressed in vivo by HSP90 inhibitors. HSP90 inhibition is therefore a potentially effective therapeutic strategy for p95-HER2-mediated Trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer."

The odor of the native areolar secretion intensified more than all other stimuli the infants' inspiratory activity and appetitive oral responses. These responses appeared to develop independently from direct experience with the breast or milk.Areolar secretions from lactating women are especially salient to human newborns.

https://openalex.org/W2112998638,"Flexible links between sensory stimuli and behavioral responses underlie many cognitive processes. One process that contributes to flexible decision-making is categorization. Some categories are innate or overlearned, but, in many cases, category boundaries represent flexible decision criteria that can shift on the fly to adapt to changes in the environment. The ability to shift category boundaries allows decision-making to adapt to changing circumstances. We found that monkeys were able to switch rapidly between two category boundaries when classifying the speed of a moving dot pattern and that neurons in monkey frontal eye field (FEF) changed their activity when the boundary changed. The responses of a subpopulation of FEF neurons that were sensitive to both stimulus and boundary speed were used to classify the stimuli as accurately as the monkeys' performance."

In addition, BRAF is mutated in the majority of low-grade gliomas and its expression and activity is significantly increased in the majority of high-grade gliomas. Although the importance of RTKs and RAS signaling in glioma development has been shown, the role of BRAF has yet to be characterized. We evaluated the effect of activated BRAF in glioma formation using the retroviral replication-competent avian leukosis virus long terminal repeat, splice acceptor (RCAS)/TVA system to transfer genes encoding activated forms of BRAF, KRas, Akt and Cre to nestin-expressing neural progenitor cells in Ink4a/Arflox/lox mice in vivo. Although expression of activated BRAF alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, the combination of activated BRAF and Akt or BRAF with Ink4a/Arf loss is transforming. Interestingly, activated BRAF generates gliomas with characteristics similar to activated KRas in the context of Akt but not Ink4a/Arf loss. Our studies show a role for BRAF activation and signaling in glioma development and as potential target for glioma therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1995138175,"Choline is an essential anabolic substrate for the synthesis of phospholipids. Choline kinase phosphorylates choline to phosphocholine that serves as a precursor for the production of phosphatidylcholine, the major phospholipid constituent of membranes and substrate for the synthesis of lipid signaling molecules. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic studies of human tumors have identified a marked increase in the intracellular concentration of phosphocholine relative to normal tissues. We postulated that the observed intracellular pooling of phosphocholine may be required to sustain the production of the pleiotropic lipid second messenger, phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is generated from the cleavage of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase D2 and is a key activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT survival signaling pathways. In this study we show that the steady-state concentration of phosphocholine is increased by the ectopic expression of oncogenic H-RasV12 in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells. We then find that small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of choline kinase expression in transformed HeLa cells completely abrogates the high concentration of phosphocholine, which in turn decreases phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid and signaling through the MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways. This simultaneous reduction in survival signaling markedly decreases the anchorage-independent survival of HeLa cells in soft agar and in athymic mice. Last, we confirm the relative importance of phosphatidic acid for this pro-survival effect as phosphatidic acid supplementation fully restores MAPK signaling and partially rescues HeLa cells from choline kinase inhibition. Taken together, these data indicate that the pooling of phosphocholine in cancer cells may be required to provide a ready supply of phosphatidic acid necessary for the feed-forward amplification of cancer survival signaling pathways."

Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase-3b (Mst3b, encoded by Stk24), regulates axon outgrowth in embryonic cortical neurons in culture, but its role in vivo and in neural repair is unknown. Here we show that Mst3b mediates the axon-promoting effects of trophic factors in mature rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and is essential for axon regeneration in vivo. Reducing Mst3b levels using short hairpin RNA prevented RGCs and DRG neurons from regenerating axons in response to growth factors in culture, as did expression of a kinase-dead Mst3b mutant. Conversely, expression of constitutively active Mst3b enabled both types of neurons to extend axons without growth factors. In vivo, RGCs lacking Mst3b failed to regenerate injured axons when stimulated by intraocular inflammation. DRG neurons regenerating axons in vivo showed elevated Mst3b activity, and reducing Mst3b expression attenuated regeneration and p42/44 MAPK activation. Thus, Mst3b regulates axon regeneration in both CNS and PNS neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2160682336,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a potent anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, its mechanism of action in osteoblast and bone is not well understood. In this study, we show that the anabolic actions of PTH in bone are severely impaired in both growing and adult ovariectomized mice lacking bone-related activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Our study demonstrates that ATF4 deficiency suppresses PTH-stimulated osteoblast proliferation and survival and abolishes PTH-induced osteoblast differentiation, which, together, compromise the anabolic response. We further demonstrate that the PTH-dependent increase in osteoblast differentiation is correlated with ATF4-dependent up-regulation of Osterix. This regulation involves interactions of ATF4 with a specific enhancer sequence in the Osterix promoter. Furthermore, actions of PTH on Osterix require this same element and are associated with increased binding of ATF4 to chromatin. Taken together these experiments establish a fundamental role for ATF4 in the anabolic actions of PTH on the skeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2011188977,"The Lats2 tumor suppressor protein has been implicated earlier in promoting p53 activation in response to mitotic apparatus stress, by preventing Mdm2-driven p53 degradation. We now report that Lats2 also has a role in an ATR-Chk1-mediated stress check point in response to oncogenic H-Ras. Activated mutant H-Ras triggers the translocation of Lats2 from centrosomes into the nucleus, coupled with an increase in Lats2 protein levels. This leads to the induction of p53 activity, upregulation of proapoptotic genes, downregulation of antiapoptotic genes and eventually apoptotic cell death. Many of the cells that survive apoptosis undergo senescence. However, a fraction of the cells escape this checkpoint mechanism, despite maintaining a high mutant H-Ras expression. These escapers display increased genome instability, as evidenced by a substantial fraction of cells with micronuclei and cells with polyploid genomes. Interestingly, such cells show markedly reduced levels of Lats2, in conjunction with enhanced hypermethylation of the Lats2 gene promoter. Our findings suggest that Lats2 might have an important role in quenching H-Ras-induced transformation, whereas silencing of Lats2 expression might serve as a mechanism to enable tumor progression."

IntroductionApoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a genetically regulated process with critical roles in development and homeostasis in metazoans (1.Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Deficient apoptosis leads to the absence of normal cell death and contributes to the development and progression of human cancers (2.Fesik S.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death can be initiated through the engagement of cell surface proapoptotic receptors by their specific ligands or by changes in internal cellular integrity (3.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M.

Both of these pathways converge at the activation of caspases, cysteine-dependent aspartyl-specific proteases that comprise the effector arm of apoptotic cell death (5.Salvesen G.S. Abrams J.M.

Efforts to identify small molecule antagonists of IAPs have led to the discovery of a number of IAP antagonistic compounds that possess antiapoptotic activity both in vitro and in vivo (26.Flygare J.A.

Contrary to its essential role in IAP antagonist-induced cell death, TNFα is not required for synergistic activity of PARAs and IAP antagonists. In type II cells, FasL- or DR5 agonist antibody-induced apoptosis is efficiently inhibited by down-regulation of Bid. However, down-regulation of XIAP or antagonism of XIAP by small molecules rescues the effect of Bid knockdown in these cells by allowing activation of effector caspases via a type I-like mechanism, thus enabling efficient PARA-induced apoptosis. These data provide a mechanistic foundation for investigating combinations of IAP antagonists and proapoptotic receptor agonists as a novel cancer therapeutic approach.DISCUSSIONEfforts to translate fundamental understanding of the apoptotic pathways into novel cancer therapeutics have yielded several promising approaches that are currently undergoing evaluation. IAP proteins are expressed at elevated levels in many tumor types (37.Hunter A.M. LaCasse E.C. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1543-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In addition, IAP-mediated inhibition of cell death and promotion of survival signaling pathways distinguish IAP proteins as attractive targets for anticancer therapeutic intervention (26.Flygare J.A. Vucic D. Future Oncol. 2009; 5: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Another promising approach is based on engagement of the proapoptotic receptors DR4 and/or DR5 (38.Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). DR4 and DR5 appear to be expressed widely in tumor tissues, and the DR5 agonist antibody has demonstrated antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo and is currently undergoing clinical investigation (15.Adams C. Totpal K. Lawrence D. Marsters S. Pitti R. Yee S. Ross S. Deforge L. Koeppen H. Sagolla M. Compaan D. Lowman H. Hymowitz S. Ashkenazi A.

Combination of these two anticancer strategies has shown marked proapoptotic activity, thus validating this potential therapeutic approach (39.Fulda S. Wick W. Weller M. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 40.Vogler M. Walczak H. Stadel D. Haas T.L. Genze F. Jovanovic M. Bhanot U. Hasel C. Möller P. Gschwend J.E. Simmet T. Debatin K.M. Fulda S. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, questions remain regarding the mechanism of the synergistic interaction observed between IAP antagonists and PARAs. In the present study, we have identified critical mechanistic aspects of this tumor growth-inhibiting combination that contribute to our understanding of proapoptotic receptor signaling and its regulation by IAP proteins.IAP antagonists induce caspase-8 activation and cell death in a subset of cancer cell lines in a TNFα-dependent fashion (28.Gaither A. Porter D. Yao Y. Borawski J. Yang G. Donovan J. Sage D. Slisz J. Tran M. Straub C. Ramsey T. Iourgenko V. Huang A. Chen Y. Schlegel R. Labow M. Fawell S. Sellers W.R. Zawel L.

Cell. 2007; 131: 682-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). This process also requires de novo production of TNFα. The present study establishes that combination of IAP antagonists and PARAs synergistically cause apoptosis independently of TNFα-mediated signaling or protein synthesis. In addition, we found that IAP antagonists do not enhance caspase-8 activation by FasL or DR5 agonist antibody; rather, they enhance caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation by these PARAs. Therefore, the observed synergistic activity probably involves reversal of XIAP-mediated inhibition of the caspases-3, -7, and -9. As a result, down-regulation of XIAP protein expression greatly enhances FasL- and DR5 agonist antibody-induced apoptosis.Fas and other proapoptotic TNFR family members are important in regulating development and homeostasis and have critical roles in immune responses (8.Strasser A. Jost P.J. Nagata S. Immunity. 2009; 30: 180-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). These receptors promote apoptosis by activating caspase-8 through the assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex. In some cells (type I cells), this apoptotic signal suffices for efficient activation of the effector caspases-3 and -7, without the need for XIAP antagonism, resulting in cell death. However, in most cell lines (type II cells), this signal needs to be amplified to accomplish robust apoptosis. This amplification requires caspase-8-dependent cleavage of Bid, which induces the release of cytochrome c and endogenous XIAP antagonists, such as SMAC, from the mitochondria. Our study identifies a requirement for XIAP antagonism as a key component of death receptor-stimulated apoptotic signaling. How XIAP influences the apoptosis mechanism between different cell types is not entirely clear, although its expression levels may be one of several determining factors. The levels of XIAP that will effectively block caspase-8-mediated effector caspase activation potentially also depend on the degree of caspase-8 activation as well as the levels of caspase-3. Thus, the interplay between caspase activation and the ability of XIAP to inhibit caspase activity probably differs between different cell types. Neutralization of XIAP through down-regulation of its expression or by small molecule IAP antagonists effectively bypasses the need for mitochondrial amplification of the apoptotic signal by enabling prominent activation of the effector caspases, resulting in efficient death in cancer cell lines that are otherwise resistant to FasL- or DR5 agonist antibody-induced apoptosis.In summary, the study reported here provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed synergistic combination of IAP antagonists and FasL or DR5 agonist antibody and confirms that XIAP-mediated inhibition of the effector caspases is an important determinant of proapoptotic receptor-mediated signaling.AddendumWhile this article was under review, Jost et al.

Nature. 2009; 460: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) used XIAP- and Bid-knock-out mice to demonstrate that XIAP is a critical discriminator between type I and type II Fas-induced apoptotic signaling. Our study complements the Jost et al. report by providing evidence for the importance of XIAP in FasL- and DR5 agonist antibody-stimulated apoptosis in cancer cells and by demonstrating that TNFα-mediated signaling does not play a significant role in these apoptotic events. IntroductionApoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a genetically regulated process with critical roles in development and homeostasis in metazoans (1.Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Deficient apoptosis leads to the absence of normal cell death and contributes to the development and progression of human cancers (2.Fesik S.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death can be initiated through the engagement of cell surface proapoptotic receptors by their specific ligands or by changes in internal cellular integrity (3.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5114) Google Scholar, 4.Kaufmann S.H. Vaux D.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7414-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Both of these pathways converge at the activation of caspases, cysteine-dependent aspartyl-specific proteases that comprise the effector arm of apoptotic cell death (5.Salvesen G.S. Abrams J.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 6.Shi Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway is initiated by developmental cues or cellular stress signals. These signals activate Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) 3The abbreviations used are: BH3Bcl-2 homology 3BIRbaculoviral IAP-repeatCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidDR5death receptor 5FasLFas ligandIAPinhibitor of apoptosisXIAPX chromosome-linked IAPPARAproapoptotic receptor agonistsiRNAsmall interfering RNASMACsecond mitochondrial activator of caspasesTNFtumor necrosis factorTNFRTNF receptor. proteins, leading to neutralization of the antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1, activation of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, and subsequent disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (7.Cory S.

Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 5995-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Efforts to identify small molecule antagonists of IAPs have led to the discovery of a number of IAP antagonistic compounds that possess antiapoptotic activity both in vitro and in vivo (26.Flygare J.A.

Contrary to its essential role in IAP antagonist-induced cell death, TNFα is not required for synergistic activity of PARAs and IAP antagonists. In type II cells, FasL- or DR5 agonist antibody-induced apoptosis is efficiently inhibited by down-regulation of Bid. However, down-regulation of XIAP or antagonism of XIAP by small molecules rescues the effect of Bid knockdown in these cells by allowing activation of effector caspases via a type I-like mechanism, thus enabling efficient PARA-induced apoptosis. These data provide a mechanistic foundation for investigating combinations of IAP antagonists and proapoptotic receptor agonists as a novel cancer therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W1966183789,"Postmating, prezygotic phenotypes, especially those that underlie reproductive isolation between closely related species, have been a central focus of evolutionary biologists over the past two decades. Such phenotypes are thought to evolve rapidly and be nearly ubiquitous among sexually reproducing eukaryotes where females mate with multiple partners. Because these phenotypes represent interplay between the male ejaculate and female reproductive tract, they are fertile ground for reproductive senescence--as ejaculate composition and female physiology typically change over an individual's life span. Although these phenotypes and their resulting dynamics are important, we have little understanding of the proteins that mediate these phenotypes, particularly for species groups where postmating, prezygotic traits are the primary mechanism of reproductive isolation. Here, we utilize proteomics, RNAi, mating experiments, and the Allonemobius socius complex of crickets, whose members are primarily isolated from one another by postmating, prezygotic phenotypes (including the ability of a male to induce a female to lay eggs), to demonstrate that one of the most abundant ejaculate proteins (a male accessory gland-biased protein similar to a trypsin-like serine protease) decreases in abundance over a male's reproductive lifetime and mediates the induction of egg-laying in females. These findings represent one of the first studies to identify a protein that plays a role in mediating both a postmating, prezygotic isolation pathway and reproductive senescence."

The lysyl oxidation product adipic semialdehyde (allysine, ALL) and its oxidized end-product 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) were determined as a function of age and presence of diabetes. Surprisingly, whereas both ALL and 2-AAA increased with age and strongly correlated with cataract grade and protein absorbance at 350 nm, only ALL formation but not 2-AAA was increased by diabetes. To clarify the mechanism of oxidation, rabbit lenses were treated with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for 48 h, and proteins were analyzed by gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry for ALL, 2-AAA, and multiple glycation products. Upon exposure to HBO, rabbit lenses were swollen, and nuclei were yellow. Protein-bound ALL increased 8-fold in the nuclear protein fractions versus controls. A dramatic increase in methyl-glyoxal hydroimidazolone and carboxyethyl-lysine but no increase of 2-AAA occurred, suggesting more drastic conditions are needed to oxidize ALL into 2-AAA. Indeed the latter formed only upon depletion of glutathione and was catalyzed by H2O2. Neither carboxymethyl-lysine nor glyoxal hydroimidazolone, two markers of glyco-/lipoxidation, nor markers of lenticular glycemia (fructose-lysine, glucospane) were elevated by HBO, excluding significant lipid peroxidation and glucose involvement. The findings strongly implicate dicarbonyl/metal catalyzed oxidation of lysine to allysine, whereby low GSH combined with ascorbate-derived H2O2 likely contributes toward 2-AAA formation, since virtually no 2-AAA formed in the presence of methylglyoxal instead of ascorbate. An important translational conclusion is that chelating agents might help delay nuclear sclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2071272846,"Soman Abraham and his colleagues report a new mechanism of immune suppression used by Salmonella. The bacteria traffic to lymph nodes, where Salmonella lipopolysaccharide triggers the downmodulation of certain chemokines, disrupting the cellular organization of the lymph node and impairing adaptive immunity. We report that infection of draining lymph nodes (DLNs) by Salmonella typhimurium results in the specific downregulation of the homeostatic chemokines CCL21 and CXCL13, which are essential for normal DLN organization and function. Our data reveal that the mechanism of this suppression is dependent on S. typhimurium LPS (sLPS). The decrease in CCL21 expression involves interaction between sLPS and CCL21-producing cells within DLNs, triggering a distinct Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated host signaling response. In this response, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (Socs3) is upregulated, which negatively regulates mothers against decapentaplegic homolog-3 (Smad3)-initiated production of CCL21. Disruption of lymph node architecture and cellular trafficking enhances S. typhimurium virulence and could represent a mechanism of immune suppression used by pathogens that primarily target lymphoid tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2018547785,"The PKD1 or PKD2 genes encode polycystins (PC) 1 and 2, which are associated with polycystic kidney disease. Previously we demonstrated that PC2 interacts with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) to modulate Ca(2+) signaling. Here, we investigate whether PC1 also regulates IP(3)R. We generated a fragment encoding the last six transmembrane (TM) domains of PC1 and the C-terminal tail (QIF38), a section with the highest homology to PC2. Using a Xenopus oocyte Ca(2+) imaging system, we observed that expression of QIF38 significantly reduced the initial amplitude of IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) transients, whereas a mutation lacking the C-terminal tail did not. Thus, the C terminus is essential to QIF38 function. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that through its C terminus, QIF38 associates with the IP(3)-binding domain of IP(3)R. A shorter PC1 fragment spanning only the last TM and the C-terminal tail also reduced IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release, whereas another C-terminal fragment lacking any TM domain did not. Thus, only endoplasmic reticulum-localized PC1 can modulate IP(3)R. Finally, we show that in the polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, heterologous expression of full-length PC1 resulted in a smaller IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) response. Overexpression of the IP(3)-binding domain of IP(3)R reversed the inhibitory effect of PC1, suggesting interaction of full-length PC1 (or its cleavage forms) with endogenous IP(3)R in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. These results indicate that the behavior of full-length PC1 in mammalian cells is congruent with that of PC1 C-terminal fragments in the oocyte system. These data demonstrate that PC1 inhibits Ca(2+) release, perhaps opposing the effect of PC2, which facilitates Ca(2+) release through the IP(3)R."
https://openalex.org/W2123035720,"High-throughput gene expression profiling technologies generating a wealth of data, are increasingly used for characterization of tumor biopsies for clinical trials. By applying machine learning algorithms to such clinically documented data sets, one hopes to improve tumor diagnosis, prognosis, as well as prediction of treatment response. However, the limited number of patients enrolled in a single trial study limits the power of machine learning approaches due to over-fitting. One could partially overcome this limitation by merging data from different studies. Nevertheless, such data sets differ from each other with regard to technical biases, patient selection criteria and follow-up treatment. It is therefore not clear at all whether the advantage of increased sample size outweighs the disadvantage of higher heterogeneity of merged data sets. Here, we present a systematic study to answer this question specifically for breast cancer data sets. We use survival prediction based on Cox regression as an assay to measure the added value of merged data sets.Using time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) and hazard ratio as performance measures, we see in overall no significant improvement or deterioration of survival prediction with merged data sets as compared to individual data sets. This apparently was due to the fact that a few genes with strong prognostic power were not available on all microarray platforms and thus were not retained in the merged data sets. Surprisingly, we found that the overall best performance was achieved with a single-gene predictor consisting of CYB5D1.Merging did not deteriorate performance on average despite (a) The diversity of microarray platforms used. (b) The heterogeneity of patients cohorts. (c) The heterogeneity of breast cancer disease. (d) Substantial variation of time to death or relapse. (e) The reduced number of genes in the merged data sets. Predictors derived from the merged data sets were more robust, consistent and reproducible across microarray platforms. Moreover, merging data sets from different studies helps to better understand the biases of individual studies and can lead to the identification of strong survival factors like CYB5D1 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1992590802,"Tissue expression microarrays, employed to determine the players and mechanisms leading to prostate cancer development, have consistently shown that myosin VI, a unique actin-based motor, is upregulated in medium-grade human prostate cancers. Thus, to understand the role of myosin VI in prostate cancer development, we have characterized its intracellular localization and function in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Using light and electron microscopy, we identified myosin VI on Rab5-positive early endosomes, as well as on recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. Intracellular targeting seems to involve two myosin VI-interacting proteins, GIPC and LMTK2, both of which can be co-immunoprecipitated with myosin VI from LNCaP cells. The absence of Disabled-2 (Dab2), a tumour suppressor and myosin VI-binding partner, inhibits recruitment of myosin VI to endocytic structures at the plasma membrane in LNCaP cells, but interestingly has no effect on endocytosis. Small interfering RNA-mediated downregulation of myosin VI expression results in a significant reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion in LNCaP cells. Our results suggest that in prostate cancer cells, myosin VI regulates protein secretion, but the overexpression of myosin VI has no major impact on clathrin-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1976631050,"Robustness to natural temperature fluctuations is critical to proper development in embryos and to cellular functions in adult organisms. However, mechanisms and pathways which govern temperature compensation remain largely unknown beyond circadian rhythms. Pathways which ensure robustness against temperature fluctuations may appear to be nonessential under favorable, uniform environmental conditions used in conventional laboratory experiments where there is little variation for which to compensate. The endo-siRNA pathway, which produces small double-stranded RNAs in Drosophila, appears to be nonessential for robust development of the embryo under ambient uniform temperature and to be necessary only for viral defense. Embryos lacking a functional endo-siRNA pathway develop into phenotypically normal adults. However, we hypothesized that small RNAs may regulate the embryo's response to temperature, as a ribonucleoprotein complex has been previously shown to mediate mammalian cell response to heat shock.Here, we show that the genes DICER-2 and ARGONAUTE2, which code for integral protein components of the endo-siRNA pathway, are essential for robust development and temperature compensation in the Drosophila embryo when exposed to temperature perturbations. The regulatory functions of DICER-2 and ARGONAUTE2 were uncovered by using microfluidics to expose developing Drosophila embryos to a temperature step, in which each half of the embryo develops at a different temperature through developmental cycle 14. Under this temperature perturbation, dicer-2 or argonaute2 embryos displayed abnormal segmentation. The abnormalities in segmentation are presumably due to the inability of the embryo to compensate for temperature-induced differences in rate of development and to coordinate developmental timing in the anterior and posterior halves. A deregulation of the length of nuclear division cycles 10-14 is also observed in dicer-2 embryos at high temperatures.Results presented herein uncover a novel function of the endo-siRNA pathway in temperature compensation and cell cycle regulation, and we hypothesize that the endo-siRNA pathway may regulate the degradation of maternal cell cycle regulators. Endo-siRNAs may have a more general role buffering against environmental perturbations in other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1977729648,"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is part of a spectrum of preinvasive lesions that originate within normal breast tissue and progress to invasive breast cancer. The detection of DCIS is important for the reduction of mortality from breast cancer, but the diagnosis of preinvasive breast tumors is hampered by the lack of an adequate detection method. To identify the changes in protein expression during the initial stage of tumorigenesis and to identify the presence of new DCIS markers, we analysed serum from 60 patients with breast cancer and 60 normal controls using mass spectrometry. A 23-protein index was generated that correctly distinguishes the DCIS and control groups with sensitivities and specificities in excess of 80% in two independent cohorts. Two candidate peptides were purified and identified as platelet factor 4 (PF-4) and complement C3adesArg anaphylatoxin (C3adesArg) using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). In an independent serum set of 165 patients, PF-4 and C3adesArg were significantly upregulated in DCIS compared with non-cancerous controls, as validated using western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We conclude that our serum protein-based test, used in conjunction with image-based screening practices, could improve the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection."
https://openalex.org/W2047500501,"Skeletal muscle maintenance and repair involve several finely coordinated steps in which pluripotent stem cells are activated, proliferate, exit the cell cycle and differentiate. This process is accompanied by activation of hundreds of muscle-specific genes and repression of genes associated with cell proliferation or pluripotency. Mechanisms controlling myogenesis are precisely coordinated and regulated in time to allow the sequence of activation/inactivation of genes expression. Muscular differentiation is the result of the interplay between several processes such as transcriptional induction, transcriptional repression and mRNA stability. mRNA stability is now recognized as an essential mechanism of control of gene expression. For instance, we previously showed that the endoribonuclease L (RNase L) and its inhibitor (RLI) regulates MyoD mRNA stability and consequently muscle differentiation. We now performed global gene expression analysis by SAGE to identify genes that were down-regulated upon activation of RNase L in C2C12 myogenic cells, a model of satellite cells. We found that RNase L regulates mRNA stability of factors implicated in the control of pluripotency and cell differentiation. Moreover, inappropriate RNase L expression in C2C12 cells led to inhibition of myogenesis and differentiation into adipocytes even when cells were grown in conditions permissive for muscle differentiation. Conversely, over-expression of RLI allowed muscle differentiation of myogenic C2C12 cells even in non permissive conditions. These findings reveal the central role of RNase L and RLI in controlling gene expression and cell fate during myogenesis. Our data should provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that control muscle stem cell differentiation and into the mechanism of metaplasia observed in aging or muscular dystrophy where adipose infiltration of muscle occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1982990966,"Bacterial transcription elongation factors GreA and GreB stimulate the intrinsic RNase activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP), thus helping the enzyme to read through pausing and arresting sites on DNA. Gre factors also accelerate RNAP transition from initiation to elongation. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanism by which Gre factors facilitate transcription at two Escherichia coli promoters, PrplN and PompX, that require GreA for optimal in vivo activity. Using in vitro transcription assays, KMnO4 footprinting, and Fe2+-induced hydroxyl radical mapping, we show that during transcription initiation at PrplN and PompX in the absence of Gre factors, RNAP falls into a condition of promoter-proximal transcriptional arrest that prevents production of full-length transcripts both in vitro and in vivo. Arrest occurs when RNAP synthesizes 9–14-nucleotide-long transcripts and backtracks by 5–7 (PrplN) or 2–4 (PompX) nucleotides. Initiation factor σ70 contributes to the formation of arrested complexes at both promoters. The signal for promoter-proximal arrest at PrplN is bipartite and requires two elements: the extended −10 promoter element and the initial transcribed region from positions +2 to +6. GreA and GreB prevent arrest at PrplN and PompX by inducing cleavage of the 3′-proximal backtracked portion of RNA at the onset of arrested complex formation and stimulate productive transcription by allowing RNAP to elongate the 5′-proximal transcript cleavage products in the presence of substrates. We propose that promoter-proximal arrest is a common feature of many bacterial promoters and may represent an important physiological target of regulation by transcript cleavage factors.

https://openalex.org/W2060670806,"Mammalian host cell invasion by Leishmania is a complex process in which various parasite and host cell components interact, triggering the activation of signaling cascades in both cells. Little is known regarding PKC biological functions in Leishmania sp. during parasite-macrophage interaction. PKC-like enzyme was first identified in homogenates and membrane fraction of L. mexicana stationary promastigotes by immunoblot. PKC-like enzyme activity was then detected in cell homogenates but also on intact promastigotes showing for the first time the presence of an ecto-PKC dependent on Ca(2+)/phosphatidylserine for activation. This ecto-PKC was activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and inhibited by RO-32-0432, a selective PKCalphabeta(I)epsilon bisindolylmaleimide inhibitor. Interestingly, the Leishmania PKC- activity was higher in the infective stationary than in non-infective logarithmic stage. Then, promastigotes at different stages of time proliferation curve were used in order to identify the role of PKC-like during macrophage invasion. After attachment to macrophages, PKC-like is over-expressed in promastigotes at the 6(th) culture day but also at the 4(th) day of culture corresponding to the maximal infection capacity. An antibody microarray for MAPK and PKC corroborate the Leishmania PKC-like over-expression during contact with macrophages. Pretreatment with RO-32-0432 inhibitor reduced the number of infected macrophages and the parasite burden. These data suggest for the first time a direct link between PKC expression level and infectivity, and provide evidence that PKC-like plays a critical role in attachment and in the internalization steps involved in the invasion process."
https://openalex.org/W2012207172,"Cell nuclei are commonly isolated and studied in media which include millimolar concentrations of cations, which conserve the nuclear volume by screening the negative charges on chromatin and maintaining its compaction. However, two factors question if these ionic conditions correctly reproduce the environment of nuclei in vivo: the small-scale motion and conformation of chromatin in vivo are not reproduced in isolated nuclei, and experiments and theory suggest that small ions in the cytoplasm are not free in the soluble phase but are predominantly bound to macromolecules. We studied the possible role in maintaining the structure and functions of nuclei in vivo of a further but frequently overlooked property of the cytoplasm, the crowding or osmotic effects caused by diffusible macromolecules whose concentration, measured in several studies, is in the range of 130 mg/ml. Nuclei which conserved their volume in the cell and their ultrastructure seen by electron microscopy were released from K562 cells in media containing the inert polymer 70 kDa Ficoll (50% w/v) or 70 kDa dextran (35% w/v) to replace the diffusible cytoplasmic molecules which were dispersed on cell lysis with digitonin, with 100 microM K-Hepes buffer as the only source of ions. Immunofluorescence labelling and experiments using cells expressing GFP-fusion proteins showed that internal compartments (nucleoli, PML and coiled bodies, foci of RNA polymerase II) were conserved in these nuclei, and nascent RNA transcripts could be elongated. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that crowding by diffusible cytoplasmic macromolecules is a crucial but overlooked factor which supports the nucleus in vivo by equilibrating the opposing osmotic pressure cause by the high concentration of macromolecules in the nucleus, and suggest that crowded media provide more physiological conditions to study nuclear structure and functions. They may also help to resolve the long-standing paradox that the small-scale motion and irregular conformation of chromatin seen in vivo are not reproduced in nuclei isolated in conventional ionic media."

It is differentially spliced and the three major variants (A, B, and F) differ in their localization and transport characteristics. Most knowledge about its regulation comes from experiments in Xenopus oocytes as NKCC2 proved difficult to functionally express in a mammalian system. Here we report the cloning and functional expression of untagged and unmodified versions of the major splice variants from ferret kidney (fNKCC2A, -B, and -F) in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Many NKCC2 antibodies used in this study detected high molecular weight forms of the transfected proteins, probably NKCC2 dimers, but not the monomers. Interestingly, monomers were strongly detected by phosphospecific antibodies directed against phosphopeptides in the regulatory N terminus. Bumetanide-sensitive (86)Rb uptake was significantly higher in transfected HEK-293 cells and could be stimulated by incubating cells in a medium containing a low chloride concentration prior the uptake measurements. fNKCC2 was less sensitive to the reduction in chloride concentration than NKCC1. Using HEK-293 cells stably expressing fNKCC2A we also show that co-expression of variant NKCC2AF does not have the dominant-negative effect on NKCC2A activity that was seen in Xenopus oocytes, nor is it trafficked to the cell surface. In addition, fNKCC2AF is neither complex glycosylated nor phosphorylated in its N terminus regulatory region like other variants."
https://openalex.org/W2068327073,"GATA1 is essential for the differentiation of erythroid cells and megakaryocytes. The Gata1 gene is composed of multiple untranslated first exons and five common coding exons. The erythroid first exon (IE exon) is important for Gata1 gene expression in hematopoietic lineages. Because previous IE exon knockdown analyses resulted in embryonic lethality, less is understood about the contribution of the IE exon to adult hematopoiesis. Here, we achieved specific deletion of the floxed IE exon in adulthood using an inducible Cre expression system. In this conditional knock-out mouse line, the Gata1 mRNA level was significantly down-regulated in the megakaryocyte lineage, resulting in thrombocytopenia with a marked proliferation of megakaryocytes. By contrast, in the erythroid lineage, Gata1 mRNA was expressed abundantly utilizing alternative first exons. Especially, the IEb/c and newly identified IEd exons were transcribed at a level comparable with that of the IE exon in control mice. Surprisingly, in the IE-null mouse, these transcripts failed to produce full-length GATA1 protein, but instead yielded GATA1 lacking the N-terminal domain inefficiently. With low level expression of the short form of GATA1, IE-null mice showed severe anemia with skewed erythroid maturation. Notably, the hematological phenotypes of adult IE-null mice substantially differ from those observed in mice harboring conditional ablation of the entire Gata1 gene. The present study demonstrates that the IE exon is instrumental to adult erythropoiesis by regulating the proper level of transcription and selecting the correct transcription start site of the Gata1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2039984028,"Daily heterothermia is used by small mammals for energy and water savings, and seems to be preferentially exhibited during winter rather than during summer. This feature induces a trade-off between the energy saved during daily heterothermia and the energy cost of arousal, which can impact energy balance and survival under harsh environmental conditions. Especially, aging may significantly affect such trade off during cold-induced energy stress, but direct evidences are still lacking. We hypothesized that aging could alter the energetics of daily heterothermia, and that the effects could differ according to season. In the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), a non-human primate species which exhibits daily heterothermia, we investigated the effects of exposures to 25 and 12°C on body composition, energy balance, patterns of heterothermia and water turnover in adult (N = 8) and aged animals (N = 7) acclimated to winter-like or summer-like photoperiods. Acclimation to summer prevented animals from deep heterothermia, even during aging. During winter, adult animals at 12°C and aged animals at 25°C exhibited low levels of energy expenditure with minor modulations of heterothermia. The major effects of cold were observed during winter, and were particularly pronounced in aged mouse lemurs which exhibited deep heterothermia phases. Body composition was not significantly affected by age and could not explain the age-related differences in heterothermia patterns. However, aging was associated with increased levels of energy expenditure during cold exposure, in concomitance with impaired energy balance. Interestingly, increased energy expenditure and depth of heterothermia phases were strongly correlated. In conclusion, it appeared that the exhibition of shallow heterothermia allowed energy savings during winter in adult animals only. Aged animals exhibited deep heterothermia and increased levels of energy expenditure, impairing energy balance. Thus, an impaired control of the heterothermic process induced high energy costs in the aging mouse lemur exposed to cold."

It has been assumed the effects of systemic CM represent cocaine actions in peripheral tissues. However, the IC(50) values of CM have not been clearly determined for the major cocaine targets: dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters, and sodium channels. Using cells transfected with individual transporters from mice and synaptosomes from mouse striatum tissues, we observed that the inhibition IC(50) values for monoamine uptake by CM were 31-fold to 184-fold higher compared to cocaine at each of the transporters. In dorsal root ganglion neurons, cocaine inhibited sodium channels with an apparent IC(50) of 75 microM, while CM showed no observable effect at concentrations up to 3 mM. These results indicate that an equal dose of CM will not produce an equivalent peripheral effect of cocaine."
https://openalex.org/W2005207429,"Background The Drosophila gene erupted (ept) encodes the fly homolog of human Tumor Susceptibility Gene-101 (TSG101), which functions as part of the conserved ESCRT-1 complex to facilitate the movement of cargoes through the endolysosomal pathway. Loss of ept or other genes that encode components of the endocytic machinery (e.g. synatxin7/avalanche, rab5, and vps25) produces disorganized overgrowth of imaginal disc tissue. Excess cell division is postulated to be a primary cause of these ‘neoplastic’ phenotypes, but the autonomous effect of these mutations on cell cycle control has not been examined. Principal Findings Here we show that disc cells lacking ept function display an altered cell cycle profile indicative of deregulated progression through the G1-to-S phase transition and express reduced levels of the tumor suppressor ortholog and G1/S inhibitor Rbf1. Genetic reductions of the Drosophila aPKC kinase (DaPKC), which has been shown to promote tumor growth in other fly tumor models, prevent both the ept neoplastic phenotype and the reduction in Rbf1 levels that otherwise occurs in clones of ept mutant cells; this effect is coincident with changes in localization of Notch and Crumbs, two proteins whose sorting is altered in ept mutant cells. The effect on Rbf1 can also be blocked by removal of the γ-secretase component presenilin, suggesting that cleavage of a γ-secretase target influences Rbf1 levels in ept mutant cells. Expression of exogenous rbf1 completely ablates ept mutant eye tissues but only mildly affects the development of discs composed of cells with wild type ept. Conclusions Together, these data show that loss of ept alters nuclear cell cycle control in developing imaginal discs and identify the DaPKC, presenilin, and rbf1 genes as modifiers of molecular and cellular phenotypes that result from loss of ept."
https://openalex.org/W2078561937,"Lasp-2 binds to actin filaments and concentrates in the actin bundles of filopodia and lamellipodia in neural cells and focal adhesions in fibroblastic cells. Lasp-2 has three structural regions: a LIM domain, a nebulin-repeat region, and an SH3 domain; however, the region(s) responsible for its interactions with actin filaments and focal adhesions are still unclear. In this study, we revealed that the N-terminal fragment from the LIM domain to the first nebulin-repeat module (LIM-n1) retained actin-binding activity and showed a similar subcellular localization to full-length lasp-2 in neural cells. The LIM domain fragment did not interact with actin filaments or localize to actin filament bundles. In contrast, LIM-n1 showed a clear subcellular localization to filopodial actin bundles. Although truncation of the LIM domain caused the loss of F-actin binding activity and the accumulation of filopodial actin bundles, these truncated fragments localized to focal adhesions. These results suggest that lasp-2 interactions with actin filaments are mediated through the cooperation of the LIM domain and the first nebulin-repeat module in vitro and in vivo. Actin filament binding activity may be a major contributor to the subcellular localization of lasp-2 to filopodia but is not crucial for lasp-2 recruitment to focal adhesions."

Proper development and maintenance of thymus architecture depend on signals generated by a sustained crosstalk between developing thymocytes and stromal elements. Any maturation impairment occurring in either cellular component leads to an aberrant thymic development. Gene expression occurring during T lymphocyte differentiation must be coordinated in a spatio-temporal fashion; one way in which this is achieved is through the regulation by cell-cell adhesion and interactions.We examined the role played by Epithelial V-like Antigen 1 (EVA1), an Ig adhesion molecule expressed on thymus epithelial cells (TEC) and immature thymocytes, in T cell development by employing RNA interference in vitro and in vivo models. Fetal liver derived haematopoietic progenitors depleted of Eva1, displayed a delayed DN1-DN3 transition and failed to generate CD4CD8 double positive T cells in OP9-DL1 coculture system. In addition, we could observe a coordinated Eva1 up-regulation in stromal and haematopoietic cells in coculture control experiments, suggesting a possible EVA1 involvement in TEC-haematopoietic cells crosstalk mechanisms. Similarly, Rag2-gamma c double knock out mice, transplanted with Eva1 depleted haematopoietic progenitors displayed a 10-fold reduction in thymus reconstitution and a time delayed thymocytes maturation compared to controls.Our findings show that modulation of Eva1 expression in thymocytes is crucial for lymphocyte physiological developmental progression and stromal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2078707543,"In the rodent hippocampus, a phase precession phenomena of place cell firing with the local field potential (LFP) theta is called “theta phase precession” and is considered to contribute to memory formation with spike time dependent plasticity (STDP). On the other hand, in the primate hippocampus, the existence of theta phase precession is unclear. Our computational studies have demonstrated that theta phase precession dynamics could contribute to primate–hippocampal dependent memory formation, such as object–place association memory. In this paper, we evaluate human theta phase precession by using a theory–experiment combined analysis. Human memory recall of object–place associations was analyzed by an individual hippocampal network simulated by theta phase precession dynamics of human eye movement and EEG data during memory encoding. It was found that the computational recall of the resultant network is significantly correlated with human memory recall performance, while other computational predictors without theta phase precession are not significantly correlated with subsequent memory recall. Moreover the correlation is larger than the correlation between human recall and traditional experimental predictors. These results indicate that theta phase precession dynamics are necessary for the better prediction of human recall performance with eye movement and EEG data. In this analysis, theta phase precession dynamics appear useful for the extraction of memory-dependent components from the spatio–temporal pattern of eye movement and EEG data as an associative network. Theta phase precession may be a common neural dynamic between rodents and humans for the formation of environmental memories."
https://openalex.org/W2086741708,"The notion that gene duplications generating new genes and functions is commonly accepted in evolutionary biology. However, this assumption is more speculative from theory rather than well proven in genome-wide studies. Here, we generated an atlas of the rate of copy number changes (CNCs) in all the gene families of ten animal genomes. We grouped the gene families with similar CNC dynamics into rate pattern groups (RPGs) and annotated their function using a novel bottom-up approach. By comparing CNC rate patterns, we showed that most of the species-specific CNC rates groups are formed by gene duplication rather than gene loss, and most of the changes in rates of CNCs may be the result of adaptive evolution. We also found that the functions of many RPGs match their biological significance well. Our work confirmed the role of gene duplication in generating novel phenotypes, and the results can serve as a guide for researchers to connect the phenotypic features to certain gene duplications."
