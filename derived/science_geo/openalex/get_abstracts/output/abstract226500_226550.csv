It has also been postulated as an intermediate in the possible in vivo conversion of tryptophane into heteroauxin. Larsen1 has described the preparation of a material containing about two per cent of β-indolylacetaldehyde by heating tryptophane with ninhydrin (or isatin) in aqueous solution; but so far, the pure compound has not been isolated or characterized by means of crystalline derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W2020755831,"I REGRET that Dr. W. A. Cobb takes exception to my quotation of his article in “Electroencephalography” in support of my statement that the unconsciousness of concussion is associated with a depressed activity of the cerebral cortex as revealed by the electroencephalogram (E.E.G.). The misunderstanding apparently has arisen because Dr. Cobb is considering merely the wave form of the electroencephalogram and I was specifically referring to the “activity in the [cerebral] cortex as revealed by the electroencephalogram”. I must confess that electrophysiologists must accept responsibility for such misunderstanding, because we have given the electroencephalographers very little help in the interpretation of their electroencephalogram records, and they perforce have invented a descriptive nomenclature and empirically related the different types of wave forms to various cerebral disorders. In this context reference may be made to my review on the “Interpretation of Evoked Potentials in the Cerebral Cortex”1. An attempt is there made to show how these potentials may be explained by the known electrical responses of nerve cells. The relevant point for the present discussion is that the electroencephalographers assess activity by simple reference to the electrical wave forms they record, whereas my phrase “activity in the [cerebral] cortex” refers to an assessment of the level of active neuronal responses in the cortex. Admittedly there is much uncertainty in such assessment, but there is good evidence that intense patterned neuronal activity would give a very small and rapid electrical wave-form, whereas large slow potential waves indicate a low level of activity which would be largely attributable to synaptic potentials that are generated in cortical neurones by afferent discharges to the cerebral cortex. A further point is that recording from the scalp, as is usual in clinical electroencephalography, is so inefficient that the small rapid electrical activity is likely to be lost in the general noise background, as presumably occurs in the so-called ‘flat’ electroencephalogram on which Dr. Cobb bases so much of his argument."

Ammonium sulphate and carbondioxide were produced. The organism grew to form small dewdrop colonies on agar containing only thiocyanate, but it also formed large yellowish-green colonies on the surface of ordinary ‘nutrient agar’. After growth on the latter medium, the organism failed to utilize thiocyanate when transferred to inorganic solutions, irrespective of the presence or absence of thiocyanate in the nutrient agar. Some time later2 the isolation was made again, and the organism obtained showed all the same properties, including loss of the ability to utilize thiocyanate after growth to form yellowish-green pigmented colonies on media containing organic nutrients. During both isolation procedures, serial platings of the organism had been undertaken with successive selection of single colonies. The morphology of the organism and of the colonies formed on inorganic salt – agar medium appeared to be similar, although on the second occasion there was some evidence of the appearance of more than one type of colony on nutrient agar."
