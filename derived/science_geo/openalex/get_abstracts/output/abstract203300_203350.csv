https://openalex.org/W2054506989,The visual labeling of various microorganisms has been accomplished with specific fluorescent ultraviolet-absorbing compounds that not only have been bound by the cell but have been transferred by it to subsequent growth. The possibility of application to genetic studies is suggested.

https://openalex.org/W2069506678,"One of the two types of supernumerary chromosomes found in Haplopappus gracilis effects pigment production in the achene walls. When one, two, and four supernumerary chromosomes were added to the basic complement, a corresponding increase in the amount of one type of pigment was found to occur. No overlapping of the effects on pigment production was observed among different numbers of supernumeraries or between the supernumeraries and normal chromosome complement."

https://openalex.org/W1032973958,"In earlier communications (1, 2), we described a specific reaction of iodine with the sulfhydryl groups of proteins, and presented evidence that the initial product of this reaction is the sulfenyl iodide group. Part of this evidence involved spectrophotometric determination of the stoichiometry of the iodineprotein reaction. In this communication, we describe the measurement of a second product of this reaction, hydrogen ion, since the ratio of iodine consumed to hydrogen ion liberated is characteristic of the level of oxidation of iodine in this system. The establishment of this ratio has provided a further confirmation of the formation of stable sulfenyl iodide groups in native proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2033911725,"THE giant molar tooth found by Dr. L. S. B. Leakey1 in Bed II at Olduvai Gorge in Tanganyika was reported by him1,2 to be a lower deciduous second molar of a hominid, possibly related to Sinanthropus and Homo heidelbergensis. This interpretation has been questioned by a number of workers including G. H. R. von Koenigswald3 of Utrecht and John T. Robinson4 of Pretoria, who conclude that the tooth is rather a permanent upper molar, probably Australopithecine."

https://openalex.org/W1997308825,"THE importance of uronic acids in carbohydrate metabolism has only recently begun to be elucidated. The metabolism of inositol and ascorbate is known to involve uronic acid intermediates1,2, and nucleotide-bound glucuronic acid has been implicated in hyaluronic acid synthesis3."
https://openalex.org/W2009482915,"Serologic surveys of vertebrates to determine rates of eastern encephalitis infection were made to discover the most likely disseminators of virus in nature. Of the techniques available, neutralization is the most specific, and antibody is known to persist for many years. This communication reports a fivefold increase in sensitivity of neutralizing-antibody detection by the application of a plaque-reducing technique."
https://openalex.org/W2016187686,"USING techniques and supernatant similar to those used to demonstrate spontaneous potentials from explants of chick embryo cerebellum in tissue culture in Kahn tubes1, spontaneous potentials have been demonstrated in explants from the surface of the upper postero-lateral aspects of human adult cerebellum. The explants were thin slices of the full thickness of cerebellar grey matter together with some of the related white matter. The control used was dead chick cerebellar tissue, side by side with the living culture material in the same incubator, with identical amplification and recording apparatus. The living brain tissue gave the same form and magnitude of potentials on any recording channel which was tried. The form of the potentials is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 shows the typical activity after 12 hr. in culture. This consists of pairs of potentials having a complex wave-form. The first of the potentials in each pair has a magnitude of 75 μV. and the other, which follows after an interval of 12–15 sec., has about one-third of this potential. The interval between the pairs of spikes is about 45 sec. Fig. 2 shows the typical activity after 24 hr. in culture. The pairing of the spikes is much less common, and when it does occur the interval between the two members of the pair is very irregular. The interval between the potentials is more irregular and varies about 20 sec. The potentials at this time have a magnitude of about 20 μV. The culture continued to have spontaneous electrical activity until more than 72 hr. after explantation. No record of spontaneous potentials from adult brain in culture have been found in the literature. Further investigations of these potentials are in progress."

After the stimulations of the bulb and nasal mucosa, the responses appear different, but they are fundamentally composed of three successive potentials, suggesting that the last one is the action potential of glomerular dendrites."

https://openalex.org/W2028793276,"S,β-AminoethyUsothiuronium.Br.HBr (AET) is of known value in mice, and given parenterally in an appropriate dose will convert a LD
100/30 dose of whole-body X-radiation to essentially a LD)0/30 (ref. 1). The oral administration of AET prior to X-radiation is said to be effective (ref. 2 and Doherty, D. G., personal communication), but no definite results have yet been published. Oral cysteamine has been reported to be effective in both mice and rats with a longer duration of action than intraperitoneal injection3, but this has been disputed4."
https://openalex.org/W2065949680,"IN a number of cases, for example, bacteria and ascites tumour cells, it is known that nitric oxide increases radiation damage in anoxic conditions to a level comparable with that found in the presence of oxygen. The so-called oxygen effect is thus simulated by nitric oxide."

https://openalex.org/W2040769971,LITTLE is known about the biochemical changes responsible for the characteristic symptoms of scrapie. We intend to examine systematically the brain and other tissues for evidence of biochemical derangements. A communication describing the lack of alteration of the serum proteins has already been published1.
https://openalex.org/W2083882643,"Experiments showed that aldolase released from liver, and perhaps muscle cells damaged by irradiation, appears in whole blood and plasma 1 to 2 hr later. The determination of aldolase activity in serum may be used as an indication of radiation damage. Preliminary investigations on persons receiving radiotherapy for malignant tumors showed an increase in aldolase activity in whole blood that was several times greater than in blood plasma. (C.H.)"
