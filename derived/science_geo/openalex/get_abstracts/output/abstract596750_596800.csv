https://openalex.org/W2762876887,"To date, the only Neandertal genome that has been sequenced to high quality is from an individual found in Southern Siberia. We sequenced the genome of a female Neandertal from ~50,000 years ago from Vindija Cave, Croatia, to ~30-fold genomic coverage. She carried 1.6 differences per 10,000 base pairs between the two copies of her genome, fewer than present-day humans, suggesting that Neandertal populations were of small size. Our analyses indicate that she was more closely related to the Neandertals that mixed with the ancestors of present-day humans living outside of sub-Saharan Africa than the previously sequenced Neandertal from Siberia, allowing 10 to 20% more Neandertal DNA to be identified in present-day humans, including variants involved in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, schizophrenia, and other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2604942489,"Topology sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge waves in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. Waves observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for topology. We show a topological origin for two well-known equatorially trapped waves, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk Poincaré wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean and atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with topological insulators and that topology plays an unexpected role in Earth’s climate system."

In the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime, the unique Landau level spectrum of BLG is anticipated to support a non-Abelian even-denominator state that is tunable by both electric and magnetic fields. However, observation of this state, which is anticipated to be stronger than in conventional systems, has been conspicuously difficult. Here we report transport measurements of a robust even denominator FQHE in high-mobility, dual gated BLG devices. We confirm that the stability of the energy gap can be sensitively tuned and map the phase diagram. Our results establish BLG as a dynamic new platform to study topological ground states with possible non-Abelian excitations."
https://openalex.org/W2762436589,"Currently beer is booming, mainly due to the steady rise of craft breweries worldwide. Previous surveys for occurrence of mycotoxins in beer, were mainly focussed on industrial produced beer. The present survey reports the presence of mycotoxins in craft beer and how this compares to industrial produced beer. More than 1000 beers were collected from 47 countries, of which 60% were craft beers. A selection of 1000 samples were screened for the presence of aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEN), fumonisins (FBs), T-2 and HT-2 toxins (T-2 and HT-2) and deoxynivalenol (DON) using a mycotoxin 6-plex immunoassay. For confirmatory analysis, a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and applied. The 6-plex screening showed discrepancies with the LC-MS/MS analysis, possibly due to matrix interference and/or the presence of unknown mycotoxin metabolites. The major mycotoxins detected were DON and its plant metabolite deoxynivalenol-3-β-D-glucopyranoside (D3G). The 6-plex immunoassay reported the sum of DON and D3G (DON+D3G) contaminations ranging from 10 to 475 μg/L in 406 beers, of which 73% were craft beers. The popular craft beer style imperial stout, had the highest percentage of samples suspected positive (83%) with 29% of all imperial stout beers having DON+D3G contaminations above 100 μg/L. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that industrial pale lagers from Italy and Spain, predominantly contained FBs (3–69 μg/L). Besides FBs, African traditional beers also contained aflatoxins (0.1–1.2 μg/L). The presence of OTA, T-2, HT-2, ZEN, β-zearalenol, 3/15-acetyl-DON, nivalenol and the conjugated mycotoxin zearalenone 14-sulfate were confirmed in some beers. This study shows that in 27 craft beers, DON+D3G concentrations occurred above (or at) the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI). Exceeding the TDI, may have a health impact. A better control of brewing malts for craft beer, should be put in place to circumvent this potential problem."
https://openalex.org/W2763553676,"Capsaicin-sensitive sensory C-fibers derived from vagal ganglia innervate the visceral organs, and respond to inflammatory mediators and noxious stimuli. These neurons play an important role in maintenance of visceral homeostasis, and contribute to the symptoms of visceral inflammatory diseases. Vagal sensory neurons are located in two ganglia, the jugular ganglia (derived from the neural crest), and the nodose ganglia (from the epibranchial placodes). The functional difference, especially in response to immune mediators, between jugular and nodose neurons is not fully understood. In this study, we microscopically isolated murine nodose and jugular capsaicin-sensitive / Trpv1-expressing C-fiber neurons and performed transcriptome profiling using ultra-low input RNA sequencing. RNAseq detected genes with significantly differential expression in jugular and nodose neurons, which were mostly involved in neural functions. Transcriptional regulators, including Cited1, Hoxb5 and Prdm12 showed distinct expression patterns in the two C-fiber neuronal populations. Common and specific expression of immune receptor proteins was characterized in each neuronal type. The expression of immune receptors that have received little or no attention from vagal sensory biologists is highlighted including receptors for certain chemokines (CXCLs), interleukins (IL-4) and interferons (IFNα, IFNγ). Stimulation of immune receptors with their cognate ligands led to activation of the C-fibers in isolated functional assays."
https://openalex.org/W2762702862,"Taming mitosis for differentiation The mitotic oscillator consists of molecular switches known to drive cell division forward. This conserved clocklike regulatory circuit has not previously been implicated in cellular processes other than division. Multiciliated cells generate motile cilia-powered flows that are essential for brain, respiratory, and reproductive functions. Al Jord et al. found that the mitotic oscillator was activated in a calibrated fashion in terminally differentiating progenitors of multiciliated cells (see the Perspective by Levine and Holland). The oscillator function was used to drive massive production of cilia-nucleating centrioles while avoiding mitotic commitment. Thus, mammalian postmitotic progenitors can recruit and calibrate the mitotic oscillator to impose timing and directionality of cellular differentiation instead of proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2762852562,"This study investigates signals from sustained phonation and text-dependent speech modalities for Parkinson's disease screening. Phonation corresponds to the vowel /a/ voicing task and speech to the pronunciation of a short sentence in Lithuanian language. Signals were recorded through two channels simultaneously, namely, acoustic cardioid (AC) and smart phone (SP) microphones. Additional modalities were obtained by splitting speech recording into voiced and unvoiced parts. Information in each modality is summarized by 18 well-known audio feature sets. Random forest (RF) is used as a machine learning algorithm, both for individual feature sets and for decision-level fusion. Detection performance is measured by the out-of-bag equal error rate (EER) and the cost of log-likelihood-ratio. Essentia audio feature set was the best using the AC speech modality and YAAFE audio feature set was the best using the SP unvoiced modality, achieving EER of 20.30% and 25.57%, respectively. Fusion of all feature sets and modalities resulted in EER of 19.27% for the AC and 23.00% for the SP channel. Non-linear projection of a RF-based proximity matrix into the 2D space enriched medical decision support by visualization."
https://openalex.org/W2761178339,"The mandarin horticultural group is an important component of world citrus production for the fresh fruit market. This group formerly classified as C. reticulata is highly polymorphic and recent molecular studies have suggested that numerous cultivated mandarins were introgressed by C. maxima (the pummelos). C. maxima and C. reticulata are also the ancestors of sweet and sour oranges, grapefruit, and therefore of all the “small citrus” modern varieties (mandarins, tangors, tangelos) derived from sexual hybridization between these horticultural groups. Recently, NGS technologies have greatly modified how plant evolution and genomic structure are analyzed, moving from phylogenetics to phylogenomics. The objective of this work was to develop a workflow for phylogenomic inference from Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) data and to analyze the interspecific admixture along the nine citrus chromosomes for horticultural groups and recent varieties resulting from the combination of the C. reticulata and C. maxima gene pools. A GBS library was established from 55 citrus varieties, using the ApekI restriction enzyme and selective PCR to improve the read depth. Diagnostic polymorphisms (DPs) of C. reticulata/C. maxima differentiation were identified and used to decipher the phylogenomic structure of the 55 varieties. The GBS approach was powerful and revealed 30,289 SNPs and 8,794 Indels with 12.6% of missing data. 11,133 DPs were selected covering the nine chromosomes with a higher density in genic regions. GBS combined with the detection of DPs was powerful for deciphering the “phylogenomic karyotypes” of cultivars derived from admixture of the two ancestral species after a limited number of interspecific recombinations. All the mandarins, mandarin hybrids, tangelos and tangors analyzed displayed introgression of C. maxima in different parts of the genome. C. reticulata/C. maxima admixture should be a major component of the high phenotypic variability of this germplasm opening up the way for association studies based on phylogenomics."
https://openalex.org/W2762202528,"Objectives The current concepts of human fetal-placental amino acid exchange and metabolism are mainly based on animal-, in vitro- and ex vivo models. We aimed to determine and assess the paired relationships between concentrations and arteriovenous differences of 19 amino acids on the maternal and fetal sides of the human placenta in a large study sample. Methods This cross-sectional in vivo study included 179 healthy women with uncomplicated term pregnancies. During planned cesarean section, we sampled blood from incoming and outgoing vessels on the maternal (radial artery and uterine vein) and fetal (umbilical vein and artery) sides of the placenta. Amino acid concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography—tandem mass spectrometry. We calculated paired arteriovenous differences and performed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Spearman’s correlations. Results In the umbilical circulation, we observed a positive venoarterial difference (fetal uptake) for 14 amino acids and a negative venoarterial difference (fetal release) for glutamic acid (p<0.001). In the maternal circulation, we observed a positive arteriovenous difference (uteroplacental uptake) for leucine (p = 0.005), isoleucine (p = 0.01), glutamic acid (p<0.001) and arginine (p = 0.04) and a negative arteriovenous difference (uteroplacental release) for tyrosine (p = 0.002), glycine (p = 0.01) and glutamine (p = 0.02). The concentrations in the maternal artery and umbilical vein were correlated for all amino acids except tryptophan, but we observed no correlations between the uteroplacental uptake and the fetal uptake or the umbilical vein concentration. Two amino acids showed a correlation between the maternal artery concentration and the fetal uptake. Conclusions Our human in vivo study expands the current insight into fetal-placental amino acid exchange, and discloses some differences from what has been previously described in animals. Our findings are consistent with the concept that the fetal supply of amino acids in the human is the result of a dynamic interplay between fetal and placental amino acid metabolism and interconversions."
https://openalex.org/W2761717920,"Insulin resistance is a major risk factor for many diseases. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear in part because it is triggered by a complex relationship between multiple factors, including genes and the environment. Here, we used metabolomics combined with computational methods to identify factors that classified insulin resistance across individual mice derived from three different mouse strains fed two different diets. Three inbred ILSXISS strains were fed high-fat or chow diets and subjected to metabolic phenotyping and metabolomics analysis of skeletal muscle. There was significant metabolic heterogeneity between strains, diets, and individual animals. Distinct metabolites were changed with insulin resistance, diet, and between strains. Computational analysis revealed 113 metabolites that were correlated with metabolic phenotypes. Using these 113 metabolites, combined with machine learning to segregate mice based on insulin sensitivity, we identified C22:1-CoA, C2-carnitine, and C16-ceramide as the best classifiers. Strikingly, when these three metabolites were combined into one signature, they classified mice based on insulin sensitivity more accurately than each metabolite on its own or other published metabolic signatures. Furthermore, C22:1-CoA was 2.3-fold higher in insulin-resistant mice and correlated significantly with insulin resistance. We have identified a metabolomic signature composed of three functionally unrelated metabolites that accurately predicts whole-body insulin sensitivity across three mouse strains. These data indicate the power of simultaneous analysis of individual, genetic, and environmental variance in mice for identifying novel factors that accurately predict metabolic phenotypes like whole-body insulin sensitivity.

The development of disease in humans often results from a complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Although widely held that the environment plays a major role in metabolic disease, defining the heritable contribution has proven difficult. Genome-wide association studies have revealed a number of SNPs associated with metabolic disease, but collectively these do not account for the majority of disease in the population (1Imamura M.

Indeed, a number of panels comprising many different recombinant inbred mouse strains have been developed such as ILSXISS (24Williams R.W. Bennett B. Lu L. Gu J. DeFries J.C. Carosone-Link P.J.

Genet. 2004; 36: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), and several pivotal studies of dietary manipulation in these panels have provided novel insights into metabolism. For example, although calorie restriction is widely thought to mediate a prolonged life span in mice (28Weindruch R. The retardation of aging by caloric restriction: studies in rodents and primates.Toxicol. Pathol. 1996; 24: 742-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), when this was examined across 41 different inbred ILSXISS mouse strains there was profound variation in the response. Although calorie restriction was found to extend life span in a few strains, ∼10 strains underwent life-shortening in response to the same manipulation (29Liao C.Y. Rikke B.A. Johnson T.E. Diaz V. Nelson J.F. Genetic variation in the murine life span response to dietary restriction: from life extension to life shortening.Aging Cell. 2010; 9: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Similarly, marked variation in the metabolic response to high-fat, high-sucrose feeding was reported across more than 100 inbred HMDP mouse strains (23Parks B.W. Sallam T. Mehrabian M. Psychogios N. Hui S.T. Norheim F. Castellani L.W. Rau C.D. Pan C. Phun J. Zhou Z. Yang W.P. Neuhaus I. Gargalovic P.S. Kirchgessner T.G. et al.Genetic architecture of insulin resistance in the mouse.Cell Metab. 2015; 21: 334-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and diversity has also been reported among commonly used mouse strains (22Montgomery M.K. Hallahan N.L. Brown S.H. Liu M. Mitchell T.W. Cooney G.J. Turner N. Mouse strain-dependent variation in obesity and glucose homeostasis in response to high-fat feeding.Diabetologia. 2013; 56: 1129-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition to genetic diversity in metabolism, it has also been reported that individual mice from exactly the same genetic background also display considerable variability in their metabolic response to diet, further adding to the complexity of metabolic studies in mice. For example, a 4-fold difference in adiposity was observed in C57Bl/6J mice fed a high fat diet (30Koza R.A. Nikonova L. Hogan J. Rim J.S. Mendoza T. Faulk C. Skaf J. Kozak L.P. Changes in gene expression foreshadow diet-induced obesity in genetically identical mice.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e81Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and others have reported similar variability in body weight and glucose tolerance in this strain (31Burcelin R. Crivelli V. Dacosta A. Roy-Tirelli A. Thorens B. Heterogeneous metabolic adaptation of C57BL/6J mice to high-fat diet.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E834-E842Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Despite these reports, individual variability has been largely ignored as most studies of insulin resistance consider averaged data from groups of mice. These present findings highlight the key role of genetics and possibly epigenetics in metabolic homeostasis and the complex interplay between genes and the environment in determining the risk of metabolic disease. Here, we encapsulate environmental, genetic, as well as individual variability and focus on the metabolome as a read-out of the integrated contribution of these parameters to a range of phenotypes, most notably insulin resistance. We studied three inbred ILSXISS strains on two different diets and subjected them to metabolic phenotyping and metabolomics analysis of skeletal muscle.

Specific strains were selected based on their divergent responses to calorie restriction (29Liao C.Y. Rikke B.A. Johnson T.E. Diaz V. Nelson J.F.

The three strains differed in body weight on a chow diet (Fig. 1A), and HFD increased body weight in two of the three strains (Fig. 1B). Body composition measured after 4 weeks on the diet revealed HFD increased adiposity in all strains (Fig. 1C). Although strain #89 appeared resistant to HFD-induced weight gain, this strain showed a HFD-induced increase in adiposity accompanied by a decrease in lean mass (Fig. 1D). Oxygen consumption, metabolic rate, energy intake, and ambulatory activity were similar between strains (Fig. 1E, data not shown). diet high in fat and sucrose classification accuracy insulin resistance index glucose tolerance test 2-deoxyglucose very-long chain long chain area under the curve incremental area under the curve white adipose tissue body weight external insulin-resistant insulin-sensitive insulin sensitivity signature 113 correlated metabolites. Marked variability was evident in glucose tolerance between the strains (Fig. 2A). Strain #50, and to a lesser degree #89, exhibited HFD-induced glucose intolerance as apparent from the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of the glucose tolerance test (GTT) (Fig. 2B). Strain #89 was significantly more glucose-tolerant than the other strains both under chow and HFD-fed conditions (Fig. 2B). In fact, the glucose tolerance observed in strain #89 fed a HFD was indistinguishable from that observed in the other strains when fed a chow diet (Fig. 2B). Strains #50 and #97 developed hyperinsulinemia upon HFD feeding, both under fasting conditions and during the GTT (Fig. 2, D and E). The hyperinsulinemia in strain #97 was much higher than in other strains, and this probably accounted for the normal glucose tolerance upon HFD feeding (Fig. 2, A, B, D, and E). Only strain #50 developed fasting hyperglycemia on HFD (Fig. 2C), and strain #97 displayed significantly lower fasting glucose on HFD compared with the other strains on HFD (Fig. 2C). Despite the widespread variability in glucose tolerance/hyperinsulinemia, insulin action assessed ex vivo in white adipose tissue (WAT) explants was impaired in all HFD-fed strains at 10 nm insulin (Fig. 2F). Interestingly, only strain #97 displayed reduced 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake in the presence of the more physiological 0.5 nm insulin dose. This strain also showed a significantly higher insulin-stimulated 2DG uptake on chow diet than any other strain (Fig. 2F). The large variability in metabolic phenotypes observed in these mice upon HFD feeding, ranging from marked glucose intolerance (strain #50), hyperinsulinemia with normal glucose tolerance (strain #97), to mild glucose intolerance that was indistinguishable from other strains on chow diet (strain #89), provided an ideal cohort to identify metabolites associated with insulin resistance across different strains and diets. Here, we studied skeletal muscle due to its prominent role in whole-body insulin sensitivity. We subjected skeletal muscle (quadriceps) from the three strains fed two diets to metabolomics assessment using mass spectrometry and measured 165 metabolites in 29 mice. For further analyses, we also included sums and ratios of some of the metabolites, resulting in a total of 218 metabolite parameters (supplemental Table S1). We performed correlation analyses whereby each metabolite was correlated with each metabolic phenotype, including GTT iAUC, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, adiposity, HOMA-IR, WAT 2DG uptake, and a factor referred to here as the “insulin resistance index” (IRI), calculated as GTT iAUC × fasting insulin. To take into account the genetic and in particular the individual variability, rather than grouping mice and using averaged data, each mouse was used as an individual data point (n = 29). We identified 113 metabolite parameters that correlated with one or more of the metabolic phenotypes (Fig. 3A and supplemental Table S1). Of these, 44 metabolites correlated with IRI, including metabolites previously implicated in insulin resistance such as long-chain (LC) and very-long-chain (VLC) CoAs and carnitines (13Koves T.R. Ussher J.R. Noland R.C. Slentz D. Mosedale M. Ilkayeva O. Bain J. Stevens R. Dyck J.R. Newgard C.B. Lopaschuk G.D. Muoio D.M. Mitochondrial overload and incomplete fatty acid oxidation contribute to skeletal muscle insulin resistance.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Nine of these showed a correlation coefficient of ≥0.5 or ≤ −0.5 (Fig. 3B). We next wanted to assess the relationship between individual metabolites and various features of our cohort, including insulin sensitivity, diet, or strain of origin. To assess insulin sensitivity, we employed an insulin resistance index or IRI that relied on both glucose tolerance and insulin levels. This was necessary as use of either of these parameters alone would have mis-represented animals with normal glucose tolerance but substantial hyperinsulinemia or vice versa. As shown in Fig. 4, there was a 12-fold range in IRI across all animals. An upper tertile cutoff was used to separate insulin-resistant from insulin-sensitive mice. Intriguingly, although most insulin-resistant mice were fed a HFD, it is noteworthy that there were several HFD-fed mice among the insulin-sensitive mice (Fig. 4, arrowheads). Notably, most of the latter mice were from strain #89. This highlights the importance of including this strain in the analysis. Table 1 summarizes significant differences in metabolic phenotypes in the 29 mice when grouped based on insulin resistance, diet, or strains. As expected, adiposity, GTT AUC and iAUC, fasting insulin and glucose, and IRI and HOMA-IR were all significantly changed with insulin resistance and with diet (Table 1). Although adiposity was significantly increased in insulin-resistant mice (Table 1), it appears that adiposity was not driving the classification of some HFD-fed mice into the insulin-sensitive group: two HFD-fed insulin-resistant mice displayed lower adiposity than any of the HFD-fed insulin-sensitive mice and even some of the chow-fed insulin-sensitive mice (Fig. 4B, arrows and arrowheads). Somewhat unexpected were the changes between strains as they were grouped independently from diet. Notably, strain #97 showed significantly lower body weight compared with both other strains, and strain #89 displayed significantly higher fasting glucose than the other strains. The GTT AUC was significantly different between strains #50 and #97.Table 1Metabolic phenotypes of mouse groups based on IR, diet, or strainPhenotypesIRDietStrainLow IRIHigh IRIp valueChowHFDp value#50#89#97p value 50 vs. 89p value 50 vs. 97p value 89 vs. 97Body weight (g)24.725.00.812324.525.10.575925.327.222.20.10610.00220.0002Adiposity (%)16.122.70.005714.522.00.000717.917.120.00.79850.48150.3455GTT AUC105813450.0041101812860.00501321110410390.12120.03140.3980GTT iAUC3606240.00023545420.00855413794270.12510.21400.5400Fasting glucose (mm)7.67.20.38167.47.60.66477.28.66.70.00800.24470.0014Fasting insulin (ng/ml)0.520.910.00030.510.790.00930.660.580.720.46730.69000.3449IRI (1000×)1775370.00001734200.00133922252770.17360.28250.4572HOMA-IR4.37.50.00294.16.70.01535.45.45.50.98110.97950.9604 Open table in a new tab We next examined metabolite changes between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive mice. Of the 44 metabolites that significantly correlated with IRI (Fig. 3B), C22:1-CoA was the only metabolite that was significantly changed (q <0.05) with a 2.3-fold increase in insulin-resistant mice (Fig. 5). Analysis of metabolite changes between HFD and chow-fed mice identified seven metabolites that were significantly (q <0.05) changed ≥1.5-fold (Fig. 6A). Notably, C22:1-CoA was not among these metabolites. C19:3-CoA was the most significantly increased metabolite in HFD mice, whereas other metabolites (free carnitine and C2-carnitine) were decreased in HFD mice (Fig. 6, A and B). C19:3-CoA as well as other polyunsaturated acyl-CoAs likely originated from the HFD itself. Notably, there was no overlap between metabolite changes with insulin resistance or diet, which is likely due to the fact that some mice fed a HFD were quite insulin-sensitive and vice versa (Fig. 4). Interestingly, a number of metabolites were significantly changed between the different strains (Fig. 7). Arg and ratios comprising Arg, were significantly increased in strain #50 compared with strains #89 and #97 (Fig. 7, A and B). Other metabolites that were different in strain #50 compared with other strains included C14:0-ceramide and malate/citrate ratio. Only two metabolites were significantly altered between strain #97 and #89, Tyr and C16:2-CoA (Fig. 7, A and B). In summary, distinct and non-overlapping metabolites were changed with insulin resistance or diet or between strains. This outcome emphasizes the usefulness of including different strains in the analysis that are less susceptible to HFD-induced insulin resistance (such as the #89 strain), thereby making it feasible to differentiate between HFD feeding and insulin resistance per se. Given that the metabolite changes with HFD or insulin resistance were distinct and the HFD-fed mice were distributed across a range of insulin sensitivities, we reasoned that these 29 mice present an ideal cohort to perform unbiased classification analyses. We used machine learning to perform classification analyses to determine the classification accuracy (CA) of metabolites in distinguishing mice based on insulin resistance, diet, or strain, using the ensemble learner, random forest (32Breiman L. Random forests.Machine Learn. 2001; 45: 5-32Crossref Scopus (65007) Google Scholar, 33Liaw A. Wiener M. Classification and regression by randomForest.R News. 2002; 2: 18-22Google Scholar). Similar to that described above, this was performed using data from individual mice, whereby each mouse’s metabolite(s) were utilized to classify that mouse into a certain group, and the accuracy reflects “observed” versus “true” classification. In this analysis, a ratio of 2 represents 100% CA, whereas a ratio of 1 reflects random chance (34Chaudhuri R. Khoo P.S. Tonks K. Junutula J.R. Kolumam G. Modrusan Z. Samocha-Bonet D. Meoli C.C.

About half of the deaths from cardiovascular diseases were attributed to hypertension in 2008. Reduction of blood pressure to normal range is one of the major challenges in preventing complications and future burden of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, this study aims to determine prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension and its associated factors in Nepal. Methods This was a community based cross-sectional study conducted as a part of a community based intervention trial in Birendranagar Municipality of Surkhet district located at the Mid-western region of Nepal. We enrolled 1159 subjects aged 30 years and above. Out of 12 wards (administrative unit), four wards were selected randomly. Three hundred participants were recruited from each selected ward. Trained enumerator collected socio-demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data using standard STEPS questionnaires. Results Out of all participants, women were 71% and mean age was 47±12.6 years. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 38.9% (95% CI: 36–41.7) while age and sex adjusted prevalence was 40.6%. The hypertension was present in 48.1% (95% CI: 45.2–50.9) of men and 35.2% (95% CI: 32.4–37.9)] of women. Male gender (OR = 1.49), older age (OR = 1.04 per year), Dalit caste (OR = 1.71), past history of cigarettes smoking (OR = 2.78), current alcohol consumption (OR = 1.75), and raised body mass index (OR = 1.17 per unit) were identified as significant factors associated with hypertension. Of total hypertensive respondents, 53.4% (95% CI: 48.7–58) were aware, 29% (95% CI: 24.8–33.1) were receiving treatment for high blood pressure, and 8.2% (95% CI: 5.6–10.7) had controlled blood pressure. The awareness, treatment, and control status were worse in younger participants. Conclusions The study revealed high prevalence with low awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in Nepal. Gender, age, ethnicity, smoking, drinking alcohol, and body mass index were associated with hypertension. Immediate public health and individual measures are warranted to reduce future burden of cardiovascular diseases. Trial registration ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT02981251)"

Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside, a catabolite of ATP that binds and activates ≥1 of 4 transmembrane G protein-coupled cell-surface adenosine receptors (ARs)-A1, A2A, A2B, and A3. Here, we studied the role of ARs in the regulation of cytokine production by ILC2s. We found that A2BARs suppress the production of both IL-5 and IL-13 by ILC2s, whereas A2AARs augment IL-5 production and fail to affect IL-13 release. Combined stimulation of all ARs led to the suppression of both IL-5 and IL-13 production, which indicated that A2BARs dominate A2AARs. Both pre- and post-transcriptional processes may be involved in the AR modulation of ILC2 IL-5 and IL-13 production. Thus, we identify adenosine as a novel negative regulator of ILC2 activation.-Csóka, B., Németh, Z. H., Duerr, C. U., Fritz, J. H., Pacher, P., Haskó, G.

https://openalex.org/W2760859418,"Background House dust mites (HDMs) such as Dermatophagoides farinae and D. pteronyssinus represent major causes of perennial allergy. HDM proteomes are currently poorly characterized, with information mostly restricted to allergens. As of today, 33 distinct allergen groups have been identified for these 2 mite species, with groups 1 and 2 established as major allergens. Given the multiplicity of IgE-reactive mite proteins, potential additional allergens have likely been overlooked. Objective To perform a comprehensive characterization of the transcriptomes, proteomes and allergomes of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus in order to identify novel allergens. Methods Transcriptomes were analyzed by RNA sequencing and de novo assembly. Comprehensive mass spectrometry-based analyses proteomes were combined with two-dimensional IgE reactivity profiling. Results Transcripts from D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus were assembled, translated into protein sequences and used to populate derived sequence databases in order to inform immunoproteomic analyses. A total of 527 and 157 proteins were identified by bottom-up MS analyses in aqueous extracts from purified HDM bodies and fecal pellets, respectively. Based on high sequence similarities (>71% identity), we also identified 2 partial and 11 complete putative sequences of currently undisclosed D. pteronyssinus counterparts of D. farinae registered allergens. Immunoprofiling on 2D-gels revealed the presence of unknown 23 kDa IgE reactive proteins in both species. Following expression of non-glycosylated recombinant forms of these molecules, we confirm that these new allergens react with serum IgEs from 42% (8/19) of HDM-allergic individuals. Conclusions Using combined transcriptome and immunoproteome approaches, we provide a comprehensive characterization of D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus allergomes. We expanded the known allergen repertoire for D. pteronyssinus and identified two novel HDM allergens, now officially referred by the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) Nomenclature Subcommittee as Der f 36 and Der p 36."
https://openalex.org/W2761054444,"Globally, women bear an uneven burden for sexual HIV acquisition. Results from two clinical trials evaluating intravaginal rings (IVRs) delivering the antiretroviral agent dapivirine have shown that protection from HIV infection can be achieved with this modality, but high adherence is essential. Multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs) can potentially increase product adherence by offering protection against multiple vaginally transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy. Here we describe a coitally independent, long-acting pod-IVR MPT that could potentially prevent HIV and HSV infection as well as unintended pregnancy. The pharmacokinetics of MPT pod-IVRs delivering tenofovir alafenamide hemifumarate (TAF2) to prevent HIV, acyclovir (ACV) to prevent HSV, and etonogestrel (ENG) in combination with ethinyl estradiol (EE), FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives, were evaluated in pigtailed macaques (N = 6) over 35 days. Pod IVRs were exchanged at 14 days with the only modification being lower ENG release rates in the second IVR. Plasma progesterone was monitored weekly to determine the effect of ENG/EE on menstrual cycle. The mean in vivo release rates (mg d-1) for the two formulations over 30 days ranged as follows: TAF2 0.35–0.40; ACV 0.56–0.70; EE 0.03–0.08; ENG (high releasing) 0.63; and ENG (low releasing) 0.05. Mean peak progesterone levels were 4.4 ± 1.8 ng mL-1 prior to IVR insertion and 0.075 ± 0.064 ng mL-1 for 5 weeks after insertion, suggesting that systemic EE/ENG levels were sufficient to suppress menstruation. The TAF2 and ACV release rates and resulting vaginal tissue drug concentrations (medians: TFV, 2.4 ng mg-1; ACV, 0.2 ng mg-1) may be sufficient to protect against HIV and HSV infection, respectively. This proof of principle study demonstrates that MPT-pod IVRs could serve as a potent biomedical prevention tool to protect women’s sexual and reproductive health and may increase adherence to HIV PrEP even among younger high-risk populations."
https://openalex.org/W2761986774,"Members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex are virulent, multi-drug resistant pathogens that survive and replicate intracellularly in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We have discovered that B. cenocepacia cannot be cleared from CF macrophages due to defective autophagy, causing continued systemic inflammation and infection. Defective autophagy in CF is mediated through constitutive reactive oxygen species (ROS) activation of transglutaminase-2 (TG2), which causes the sequestration (accumulation) of essential autophagy initiating proteins. Cysteamine is a TG2 inhibitor and proteostasis regulator with the potential to restore autophagy. Therefore, we sought to examine the impact of cysteamine on CF macrophage autophagy and bacterial killing. Human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and alveolar macrophages were isolated from CF and non-CF donors. Macrophages were infected with clinical isolates of relevant CF pathogens. Cysteamine caused direct bacterial growth killing of live B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans, P. aeruginosa and MRSA in the absence of cells. Additionally, B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans, and P. aeruginosa invasion were significantly decreased in CF MDMs treated with cysteamine. Finally, cysteamine decreased TG2, p62, and beclin-1 accumulation in CF, leading to increased Burkholderia uptake into autophagosomes, increased macrophage CFTR expression, and decreased ROS and IL-1β production. Cysteamine has direct anti-bacterial growth killing and improves human CF macrophage autophagy resulting in increased macrophage-mediated bacterial clearance, decreased inflammation, and reduced constitutive ROS production. Thus, cysteamine may be an effective adjunct to antibiotic regimens in CF."
https://openalex.org/W2761545785,"STAT5 proteins play a role in adipocyte development and function, but their specific functions are largely unknown. To this end, we used an unbiased MS-based approach to identify novel STAT5-interacting proteins. We observed that STAT5A bound the E1β and E2 subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). Whereas STAT5A typically localizes to the cytosol or nucleus, PDC normally resides within the mitochondrial matrix where it converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. We employed affinity purification and immunoblotting to validate the interaction between STAT5A and PDC subunits in murine and human cultured adipocytes, as well as in adipose tissue. We found that multiple PDC subunits interact with hormone-activated STAT5A in a dose- and time-dependent manner that coincides with tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. Using subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that PDC-E2 is present within the adipocyte nucleus where it associates with STAT5A. Because STAT5A is a transcription factor, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to assess PDC’s ability to interact with STAT5 DNA-binding sites. These analyses revealed that PDC-E2 is bound to a STAT5-binding site in the promoter of the STAT5 target gene cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (cish). We have demonstrated a compelling interaction between STAT5A and PDC subunits in adipocytes under physiological conditions. There is previous evidence that PDC localizes to cancer cell nuclei where it plays a role in histone acetylation. On the basis of our ChIP data and these previous findings, we hypothesize that PDC may modulate STAT5’s ability to regulate gene expression by controlling histone or STAT5 acetylation.

The JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription)-signaling pathway is a ligand-activated signaling pathway that has known roles in the regulation of many cellular functions, including apoptosis, differentiation, immunological responses, and proliferation. A variety of hormones and cytokines that use the JAK/STAT pathway can modulate adipocyte differentiation and function. To date, of the seven known STATs (STAT1–4, STAT5A, STAT5B, and STAT6), STAT5 is the most characterized STAT protein involved in the regulation of adipogenesis and fat cell function. Although STAT5A and STAT5B are transcribed from separate genes, they are together referred to as STAT5 because they are highly homologous and share numerous overlapping functions. Studies from many laboratories have shown a role of STAT5 proteins, particularly STAT5A, in adipogenesis in vitro (1Richard A.J. Stephens J.M. Emerging roles of JAK-STAT signaling pathways in adipocytes.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 22: 325-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and there is also evidence that STAT5 contributes to adipose tissue development in vivo (2Stewart W.C.

In mature fat cells, however, the role of STAT5 is less clear. We know that STAT5 proteins are activated by growth hormone in adipocytes, suggesting a role in reducing lipid stores and regulating insulin action. Moreover, in the last decade, several STAT5 target genes have been identified in adipocytes, including fatty-acid synthase (4Hogan J.C. Stephens J.M. The regulation of fatty acid synthase by STAT5A.Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1968-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and adiponectin (5White U.A. Maier J. Zhao P. Richard A.J. Stephens J.M.

PDC is a multisubunit protein that is composed of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3), and E3-binding protein (E3BP) subunits that concertedly convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, and whose expression was previously thought to be restricted to the mitochondrial matrix (6Patel M.S. Roche T.E. Molecular biology and biochemistry of pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes.FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). When fully assembled, PDC is a megadalton complex composed of multiple copies of each subunit (7Zhou Z.H. Liao W. Cheng R.H. Lawson J.E. McCarthy D.B. Reed L.J. Stoops J.K.

The E1 component is further divided into E1α and E1β subunits that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation and reductive acetylation of pyruvate in the presence of thiamine pyrophosphate.

Another study shows an interaction of PDC-E2 and STAT5 in the nucleus of mouse BaF3 pro-B cells (11Chueh F.Y. Leong K.F. Cronk R.J. Venkitachalam S. Pabich S. Yu C.L. Nuclear localization of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-E2 (PDC-E2), a mitochondrial enzyme, and its role in signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)-dependent gene transcription.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our studies are the first to reveal that STAT5A can interact with PDC-E2 in adipocytes in a manner that highly correlates with STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, our results demonstrate that this interaction occurs in human adipocytes as well as in subcutaneous and visceral mouse adipose tissue. In murine adipocytes, the nuclear location of PDC-E2 was verified by independent methods. Finally, our highly novel observations reveal that PDC-E2 is part of the GH-induced STAT5-binding complex in the promoter of the STAT5 target gene cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (cish). Notably, recent studies suggest that PDC can be present in the nucleus of several cancer cell lines where it generates acetyl-CoA in the nucleus to modulate histone acetylation (13Sutendra G. Kinnaird A. Dromparis P. Paulin R. Stenson T.H. Haromy A. Hashimoto K. Zhang N. Flaim E. Michelakis E.D. A nuclear pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is important for the generation of acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation.Cell. 2014; 158: 84-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Based on our observations, we predict that association of PDC with STAT5A plays a role in the ability of STAT5 to regulate gene expression either by modulating STAT5 acetylation, histone acetylation, or the acetylation of other proteins present in the STAT5 DNA-binding complex. Although we demonstrated that PDC-E2 can bind to a STAT5-binding site, we predict that the PDC complex likely associates with other transcription factors where it can contribute to protein acetylation. Overall, our studies reveal that protein subunits comprising the acetyl-CoA-generating enzyme complex, PDC, can be present in adipocyte nuclei and be part of a STAT5 DNA-binding complex. These novel observations may shift our perspectives on the role of metabolic enzymes as well as their cellular locations and functions. To gain insight into the potential mechanisms involved in the ability of STAT5 to modulate fat cell function, we employed a non-biased MS-based approach to identify novel STAT5-interacting proteins. Briefly, STAT5A was immunoprecipitated from unstimulated and growth hormone-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize protein bands for excision. Excised protein bands were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion, and the resulting peptide fragments were analyzed and identified using liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS as described previously (14Kheterpal I. Coleman L. Ku G. Wang Z.Q. Ribnicky D. Cefalu W.T. Regulation of insulin action by an extract of Artemisia dracunculus L. in primary human skeletal muscle culture: a proteomics approach.Phytother. Res. 2010; 24: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The E1β and E2 subunits of the PDC were among the potential STAT5A-interacting proteins to emerge from our non-biased screening approach (supplemental Fig. S1). PDC-E2 was one of the few GH-regulated, STAT5A interaction partners that we discovered and the first association we sought to validate, as it had been previously reported in cultured immune cells (10Chueh F.Y. Leong K.F. Yu C.L. Mitochondrial translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in leukemic T cells and cytokine-stimulated cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 402: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Chueh F.Y. Leong K.F. Cronk R.J. Venkitachalam S. Pabich S. Yu C.L.

Signal. 2011; 23: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine whether STAT5A interacted with PDC-E2 under physiological conditions in adipocytes, we used an immunoprecipitation (IP) approach. As shown in Fig. 1, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to mouse GH (mGH) to induce STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation and then fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions. In Fig. 1A, IP with STAT5A (top panel) or IP with PDC-E2 (2nd panel) followed by Western blotting (WB) with PDC-E2 or STAT5A, respectively, clearly show an association between these two proteins, primarily within the nucleus-enriched (Nuc +) fraction under physiological conditions. We also performed this experiment with whole-cell extracts from human adipocytes (Fig. 1B) and again observed a GH-dependent interaction between STAT5A and PDC-E2. To assess the specificity of the STAT5A and PDC-E2 interaction, we examined its dose- and time-dependent regulation by STAT5 activators (Figure 2, Figure 3). In Fig. 2, mature adipocytes were treated with a range of murine growth hormone (mGH) doses, and interactions between STAT5A and PDC subunits (E1, E2, and E3) were assessed. Whole-cell extracts were incubated with a STAT5A antibody, and associated proteins pulled down by immunoprecipitation were examined by Western blotting (left-hand side of Fig. 2). Direct Western blotting input controls are shown on the same gel in the right-hand side of Fig. 2. As expected and shown on the right side in Fig. 2, mGH exposure resulted in a dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 (STAT5pY). The left side of Fig. 2 also shows that mGH induced a dose-dependent association between STAT5A and multiple PDC subunits (E1α and E2 shown in Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2 as well as E1β shown in supplemental Fig. S2). The band observed in the PDC-E3 blot is from the heavy chain of the immunoprecipitating antibody and masks any potential interaction with PDC-E3. Although we have not observed an interaction between STAT5A and the E3 subunit of PDC, our data cannot conclusively rule it out (Fig. 2 and data not shown).Figure 3GH and OSM induce the interaction between STAT5A and PDC-E2 in a time-dependent manner. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with mGH or OSM for the indicated times. Monolayers were scraped into IP lysis buffer, and whole-cell lysates were prepared. IP experiments were performed using the anti-STAT5A antibody and 300 μg of lysate protein. The mock experiment contained IP antibody but no lysate. Western blotting was used to examine the protein content of the immunoprecipitates (IP: STAT5A; left) and lysate inputs (Direct WB; right). This experiment was repeated three times on independent batches of adipocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the majority of our experiments, mock IPs containing all reagents except for cell lysates served as negative controls. Additionally, mock IPs comprised of an isotype control IgG and whole-cell lysates from vehicle- and mGH-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes produced no bands at the molecular weight of the PDC-E2 and E1 subunits (data not shown). We also assessed specificity by performing a time-course study with two known STAT5 activators, mGH and oncostatin M (OSM). As shown on the right in Fig. 3, an acute (0.3 h) treatment with GH or OSM resulted in STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation without altering the levels of PDC-E2 or STAT5A expression. In addition, GH and OSM induced an association of STAT5A with PDC-E2 in a time-dependent manner that correlated with STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation (shown on the left of Fig. 3). In addition to STAT5A, STAT1 and STAT3 are expressed in adipocytes and can be induced by OSM. To determine whether these other adipocyte-expressed STATs can associate with PDC-E2, we treated adipocytes for 20 min with OSM or vehicle and performed IP analysis with STAT1, STAT3, or STAT5A antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4, acute OSM stimulation induced an association between STAT5A and both E1α and E2 subunits of PDC, whereas STAT3 associated with these two PDC subunits in an OSM-independent manner. STAT1, however, did not significantly associate with either PDC subunit. We also induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation with IFNγ and did not observe any association between STAT1 and PDC subunits under these conditions (data not shown). To determine whether the physical association between STAT5A and PDC-E2 could also occur in vivo, we injected mice with mGH (1.5 mg/kg) or vehicle 15 min prior to sacrifice. Epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and inguinal adipose tissue (iWAT) depots were collected. Tissue homogenates were prepared and used for IP with the STAT5A antibody (Fig. 5, left) and for direct Western analysis of the IP input (Fig. 5, right). Mock contained IP antibody but no homogenate. As shown in Fig. 5, we observed a GH-induced interaction between STAT5A and PDC-E2 in both visceral (eWAT) and subcutaneous (iWAT) AT in vivo similar to our observations in cultured adipocytes (Figs. 1–Figure 3, Figure 4). Several published studies have demonstrated the presence of STAT proteins in mitochondria (10Chueh F.Y. Leong K.F. Yu C.L.

Although we did visualize immunogold-labeled STAT5A localized within some mitochondria of 3T3-L1 adipocytes via transmission electron microscopy (data not shown), knocking down or activating STAT5A in adipocytes produced no significant alterations in mitochondrial gene expression or function (data not shown and supplemental Fig. S3). Based on a study in cancer cells that showed the PDC complex could be present in the nucleus (13Sutendra G. Kinnaird A. Dromparis P. Paulin R. Stenson T.H. Haromy A. Hashimoto K. Zhang N. Flaim E. Michelakis E.D. A nuclear pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is important for the generation of acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation.Cell. 2014; 158: 84-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), we employed immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy and subcellular fractionation to assess whether PDC could be present in the nucleus of fat cells. For IF microscopy, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown on coverslips and treated with mGH. IF was conducted using primary antibodies directed against PDC-E2 and STAT5pY. In Fig. 6, the green staining represents PDC-E2 (A) and the red staining represents tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 (B). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Fig. 6, C and D, blue). Remarkably, we observed some PDC-E2 localized within the adipocyte nucleus as indicated by the cyan color inside the DAPI-stained nucleus (shown in the Merge panel, Fig. 6C). The yellow-orange color suggests co-localization of PDC-E2 and STAT5pY outside of the nucleus, and co-localization of PDC-E2 and STAT5pY within the adipocyte nucleus appears as white spots (Fig. 6, C and D). The co-localization of PDC-E2 and STAT5pY shown by confocal microscopy falls short of demonstrating whether these two proteins physically associate in the adipocyte nucleus. To confirm the presence of PDC-E2 in the adipocyte nuclei, we fractionated whole-cell extracts to obtain cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig. 7A, we observed STAT5pY only in GH-treated cells. We also observed that STAT5 is enriched in the cytosol, whereas PDC-E2 is enriched in the mitochondria. However, PDC-E2 was also present in the nuclei, and STAT5A was present in mitochondria. Analysis of GAPDH confirmed that there was no cytosolic contamination of the nuclear fractions, and the pattern of Lamin expression confirmed that the mitochondrial fraction was not contaminated by nuclear protein. Also, the expression of three mitochondrial markers confirmed that the nuclear fraction was not contaminated with mitochondrial proteins. To assess whether PDC-E2 and STAT5A can physically associate in the nucleus, we performed IP and Western blot analysis on cellular fractions. As shown in Fig. 7B, the expression of PDC-E2 does not change in any fraction following GH treatment. Direct Western blot analysis of the input samples also confirmed the expected increase in STAT5A in the nucleus following GH stimulation. Notably, the interaction between STAT5A and PDC-E2 occurred primarily in the nucleus. cish, or cis, is a well-established STAT5 target gene in several cells, including adipocytes. Expression of cish is acutely induced by activated STAT5 binding to its promoter, and the CISH protein acts a negative regulator to shut down JAK-STAT signaling (20Davey H.W. McLachlan M.J. Wilkins R.J. Hilton D.J. Adams T.E. STAT5b mediates the GH-induced expression of SOCS-2 and SOCS-3 mRNA in the liver.Mol. Cell.

CIS, a cytokine inducible SH2 protein, is a target of the JAK-STAT5 pathway and modulates STAT5 activation.Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, we performed ChIP analysis to examine protein binding to an established STAT-binding site in the cish promoter. As expected, GH treatment resulted in a significant increase in STAT5 binding to the cish promoter. Notably, we also observed PDC-E2 binding to this same site in a growth hormone-dependent manner. Because the magnitude of binding was lower than we observed for STAT5, we also examined the binding of a known STAT5 transcriptional coactivator, CREB-binding protein (CBP). We observed that this coactivator bound the cish promoter at levels very similar to what we observed for PDC-E2. Because STAT5 has a prominent role in adipocyte development and function, we sought to identify novel STAT5-interacting proteins in fat cells to further understand the role of this signaling molecule and transcription factor. To our surprise, two mitochondrial proteins belonging to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were identified from our unbiased screening method. Notably, both of these proteins, PDC-E1 and PDC-E2, interacted with STAT5A in a GH-regulated manner, suggesting that STAT5 only interacts with the PDC complex when it is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results clearly demonstrate that STAT5A and the E2 subunit of PDC (PDC-E2) associate in murine and human adipocytes under physiological conditions following GH stimulation (Fig. 1). We demonstrated the specificity of this interaction by showing dose and time effects concurrent with GH stimulation and STAT5 activation (Figure 2, Figure 3 and supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, we observed that other STAT5 activators could also induce the physical association of STAT5A and PDC-E2 in adipocytes (Figure 3, Figure 4), and we showed that STAT5A interacts with the E1α and E1β subunits of PDC as well (Figure 2, Figure 4 and supplemental Fig. S2). Notably, we detected the interaction of STAT5A and PDC-E2 in both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue from GH-injected mice (Fig. 5). The results of these studies led to nearly 2 years of negative data as we focused on the potential function of a PDC-E2/STAT5A association in the mitochondria. Although we could confirm that STAT5A was present in the mitochondria by subcellular fractionation (Fig. 7, A and B) and by transmission electron microscopy (data not shown), we were unable to substantially perturb mitochondrial function with either GH stimulation or knockdown of STAT5A in adipocytes (supplemental Fig. S3). However, we remained confident in our observations demonstrating the association of STAT5A and PDC-E2 in adipocytes in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 1–Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Independent studies also support an interaction of STAT5 and PDC proteins in non-adipocyte cells as a previous study had shown that STAT5 proteins can associate with PDC-E2 in a leukemic T cell line (10Chueh F.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2761619732,"Background Loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification (LAMP) methodology offers an opportunity for point-of-care (POC) molecular detection of asymptomatic malaria infections. However, there is still little evidence on the feasibility of implementing this technique for population screenings in isolated field settings. Methods Overall, we recruited 1167 individuals from terrestrial (‘road’) and hydric (‘riverine’) communities of the Peruvian Amazon for a cross-sectional survey to detect asymptomatic malaria infections. The technical performance of LAMP was evaluated in a subgroup of 503 samples, using real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) as reference standard. The operational feasibility of introducing LAMP testing in the mobile screening campaigns was assessed based on field-suitability parameters, along with a pilot POC-LAMP assay in a riverine community without laboratory infrastructure. Results LAMP had a sensitivity of 91.8% (87.7–94.9) and specificity of 91.9% (87.8–95.0), and the overall accuracy was significantly better among samples collected during road screenings than riverine communities (p≤0.004). LAMP-based diagnostic strategy was successfully implemented within the field-team logistics and the POC-LAMP pilot in the riverine community allowed for a reduction in the turnaround time for case management, from 12–24 hours to less than 5 hours. Specimens with haemolytic appearance were regularly observed in riverine screenings and could help explaining the hindered performance/interpretation of the LAMP reaction in these communities. Conclusions LAMP-based molecular malaria diagnosis can be deployed outside of reference laboratories, providing similar performance as qPCR. However, scale-up in remote field settings such as riverine communities needs to consider a number of logistical challenges (e.g. environmental conditions, labour-intensiveness in large population screenings) that can influence its optimal implementation."

A paper-and-pencil questionnaire was administered to 425 nurses in an Italian hospital, and a hierarchical multiple regression was used to test the hypotheses. In addition to the job demands and job resources considered, followers' active engagement had a significant impact on job satisfaction. Moreover, it showed a significant linear and curvilinear relationship with the outcome variable. Followers' independent critical thinking has a non significant relationship with job satisfaction, confirming the mixed results obtained in the past for this dimension. These findings bore out the importance of analyzing followers' behaviors as potential resources that people can use on the job to increase their own well-being.

Due to its remarkable metabolic properties, particularly the degradation of trimethylamines, this strain was supposed to be used as ""Archaebiotic"" during metabolic disorders of the human intestine. However, there is still no data published regarding adaptations to the natural habitat of M. luminyensis as it has been shown for the other two reported mucosa-associated methanoarchaea. This study aimed at unraveling susceptibility of M. luminyensis to antimicrobial peptides as well as its immunogenicity. By using the established microtiter plate assay adapted to the anaerobic growth requirements of methanogenic archaea, we demonstrated that M. luminyensis is highly sensitive against LL32, a derivative of human cathelicidin (MIC = 2 μM). However, the strain was highly resistant against the porcine lysin NK-2 (MIC = 10 μM) and the synthetic antilipopolysaccharide peptide (Lpep) (MIC>10 μM) and overall differed from the two other methanoarchaea, Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae in respect to AMP sensitivity. Moreover, only weak immunogenic potential of M. luminyensis was demonstrated using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) by determining release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

https://openalex.org/W2763148553,"Background Pulmonary edema is a hallmark of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Smoke inhalation causes ARDS, thus significantly increasing the mortality of burn patients. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) exert potent anti-inflammatory properties. The goal of the present study was to test the safety and ecfficacy of ASCs, in a well-characterized clinically relevant ovine model of ARDS. Methods Female sheep were surgically prepared. ARDS was induced by cooled cotton smoke inhalation. Following injury, sheep were ventilated, resuscitated with lactated Ringer’s solution, and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics were monitored for 48 hours in a conscious state. Pulmonary microvascular hyper-permeability was assessed by measuring lung lymph flow, extravascular lung water content, protein content in plasma and lung lymph fluid. Sheep were randomly allocated to two groups: 1) ASCs: infused with 200 million of ASCs in 200mL of PlasmaLyteA starting 1 hours post-injury, n = 5; 2) control, treated with 200mL of PlasmaLyteA in a similar pattern, n = 5. Results Lung lymph flow increased 9-fold in control sheep as compared to baseline. Protein in the plasma was significantly decreased, while it was increased in the lung lymph. The treatment with ASCs significantly attenuated these changes. Treatment with ASCs almost led to the reversal of increased pulmonary vascular permeability and lung water content. Pulmonary gas exchange was significantly improved by ASCs. Infusion of the ASCs did not negatively affect pulmonary artery pressure and other hemodynamic variables. Conclusions ASCs infusion was well tolerated. The results suggest that intravenous ASCs modulate pulmonary microvascular hyper-permeability and prevent the onset of ARDS in our experimental model."

Consequently, there is interest in understanding the role of professional medical interpreters in efforts to improve patient safety. Objective To describe the views of professional medical interpreters on their role in the delivery of safe patient care. Design Qualitative analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews. Participants 15 professional medical interpreters affiliated with the Healthcare Interpretation Network in Toronto, Canada. Approach Participants’ views on their role in patient safety were analyzed and organized into themes. Key results Professional medical interpreters described being uniquely situated to identify and prevent adverse events involving patients with LEP by: 1) facilitating communication and enhancing patients’ comprehension, 2) giving voice to patients, and 3) speaking up about safety concerns. Participants described a tension between ‘speaking up’ and interpreters’ ethical imperative to remain impartial. Interpreters also highlighted several challenges, including 4) medical hierarchy and healthcare providers’ limited knowledge of the role of interpreters. These challenges introduced safety issues if providers asked interpreters to act outside of their scope of practice. Conclusions Our study found that professional medical interpreters view their work as integral to the delivery of safe care to patients with LEP. In order to effectively engage in patient safety efforts together, interpreters and providers require a mutual understanding of their roles. Team hierarchy and limited provider knowledge of the role of interpreters can introduce safety concerns. In addition, interpreters describe a tension between “speaking up” about patient safety and the need for interpreters to remain impartial when facilitating communication. Healthcare institutions, providers, and interpreters must engage in discussion on how to best to “speak up” and integrate interpreters into safety efforts. Importantly, the benefits of partnering with interpreters can only be realized when providers consistently use their services."
https://openalex.org/W2762014689,"Increased dietary fiber (DF) fermentation and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production may stimulate peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) secretion. In this study, the effects of hindgut SCFA production on postprandial PYY plasma levels were assessed using different experimental diets in a porto-arterial catheterized pig model. The pigs were fed experimental diets varying in source and levels of DF for one week in 3×3 Latin square designs. The DF sources were whole-wheat grain, wheat aleurone, rye aleurone-rich flour, rye flakes, and resistant starch. Postprandial blood samples were collected from the catheters and analyzed for PYY levels and net portal appearance (NPA) of PYY was correlated to NPA of SCFA. No significant effects of diets on NPA of PYY were observed (P > 0.05), however, resistant starch supplementation increased postprandial NPA of PYY levels by 37 to 54% compared with rye-based and Western-style control diets (P = 0.19). This increase was caused by higher mesenteric artery and portal vein PYY plasma levels (P < 0.001) and was independent of SCFA absorption (P > 0.05). The PYY levels were higher in response to the second daily meal compared with the first daily meal (P < 0.001), but similar among diets (P > 0.10). In conclusion, the increased postprandial PYY responses in pigs fed with different levels and sources of DF are not caused by an increased SCFA absorption and suggest that other mechanisms such as neural reflexes and possibly an increased flow of digesta in the small intestine may be involved. The content of DF and SCFA production did not affect PYY levels."
https://openalex.org/W2760821514,"Forest land-use changes have long been suggested to profoundly affect soil microbial communities. However, how forest type conversion influences soil microbial properties remains unclear in Tibetan boreal forests. The aim of this study was to explore variations of soil microbial profiles in the surface organic layer and subsurface mineral soil among three contrasting forests (natural coniferous forest, NF; secondary birch forest, SF and spruce plantation, PT). Soil microbial biomass, activity and community structure of the two layers were investigated by chloroform fumigation, substrate respiration and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), respectively. In the organic layer, both NF and SF exhibited higher soil nutrient levels (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus), microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, microbial respiration, PLFA contents as compared to PT. However, the measured parameters in the mineral soils often did not differ following forest type conversion. Irrespective of forest types, the microbial indexes generally were greater in the organic layer than in the mineral soil. PLFAs biomarkers were significantly correlated with soil substrate pools. Taken together, forest land-use change remarkably altered microbial community in the organic layer but often did not affect them in the mineral soil. The microbial responses to forest land-use change depend on soil layer, with organic horizons being more sensitive to forest conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2761499799,"As plant fibres are increasingly used in technical textiles and their composites, underlying principles of wound healing in living plant fibres are relevant to product quality, and provide inspiration for biomimetic healing in synthetic materials. In this work, two Linum usitatissimum cultivars differing in their stem mechanical properties, cv. Eden (stems resistant to lodging) and cv. Drakkar (with more flexible stems), were grown without wound or with stems previously wounded with a cut parallel or transversal to the stem. To investigate wound healing efficiency, growth traits, stem biomechanics with Dynamic Mechanical Analysis and anatomy were analysed after 25-day recovery. Longitudinal incisions formed open wounds while transversal incisions generated stem growth restoring the whole cross-section but not the original stem organisation. In the case of transversal wound healing, all the bast fibre bundles in the perturbed area became lignified and pulled apart by parenchyma cells growth. Both Linum cultivars showed a healing efficiency from 79% to 95% with higher scores for transversal healing. Morphological and anatomical modifications of Linum were related to mechanical properties and healing ability. Alongside with an increased understanding of wound healing in plants, our results highlight their possible impact on textile quality and fibre yield."
https://openalex.org/W2761835541,"We investigated PD-L1 changes in response to MEK and AKT inhibitors in KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma (adeno-NSCLC). PD-L1 expression was quantified using immunofluorescence and co-culture with a jurkat cell-line transfected with NFAT-luciferase was used to study if changes in PD-L1 expression in cancer cell lines were functionally relevant. Five KRAS mutant cell lines with high PD-L1 expression (H441, H2291, H23, H2030 and A549) were exposed to GI50 inhibitor concentrations of a MEK inhibitor (trametinib) and an AKT inhibitor (AZD5363) for 3 weeks. Only 3/5 (H23, H2030 and A549) and 2/5 cell lines (H441 and H23) showed functionally significant increases in PD-L1 expression when exposed to trametinib or AZD5363 respectively. PD-L1 overexpression is not consistent and is unlikely to be an early mechanism of resistance to KRAS mutant adeno-NSCLC treated with MEK or AKT inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2761344118,"NIMA-related kinase 1 (NEK1) is a serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in mammalian germ cells. Mutations in Nek1 induce anemia, polycystic kidney and infertility. In this study we evaluated the role of NEK1 in meiotic spindle formation in both male and female gametes. Our results show that the lack of NEK1 provokes an abnormal organization of the meiosis I spindle characterized by elongated and/or multipolar spindles, and abnormal chromosome congression. The aberrant spindle structure is concomitant with the disruption in localization and protein levels of myosin X (MYO10) and α-adducin (ADD1), both of which are implicated in the regulation of spindle formation during mitosis. Interaction of ADD1 with MYO10 is dependent on phosphorylation, whereby phosphorylation of ADD1 enables its binding to MYO10 on mitotic spindles. Reduction in ADD1 protein in NEK1 mutant mice is associated with hyperphosphorylation of ADD1, thereby preventing the interaction with MYO10 during meiotic spindle formation. Our results reveal a novel regulatory role for NEK1 in the regulation of spindle architecture and function during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2763305193,"Formins are proteins that assist in regulating cytoskeletal organization through interactions with actin filaments and microtubules. Metazoans encode nine distinct formin subtypes based on sequence similarity, potentially allowing for great functional diversity for these proteins. Through the evolution of the eukaryotes, formins are believed to have repeatedly undergone rounds of gene duplications, followed by diversification and domain shuffling, but previous phylogenetic analyses have shed only a little light on the specific origins of different formin subtypes. To improve our understanding of this in the case of the metazoan formins, phylogenetic comparisons were made here of a broad range of metazoan and non-metazoan formin sequences. This analysis suggests a model in which eight of the nine metazoan formin subtypes arose from two ancestral proteins that were present in an ancient unikont ancestor. Additionally, evidence is shown suggesting the common ancestor of unikonts and bikonts was likely to have encoded at least two formins, a canonical Drf-type protein and a formin bearing a PTEN-like domain."
https://openalex.org/W2764195188,"Treatment of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) represents a challenge. Due to the high prevalence of renal disease associated to CanL, it is important to find an effective drug that does not damage the kidneys. Marbofloxacin has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in non-azotemic dogs with leishmaniasis. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of marbofloxacin in dogs with leishmaniasis and decreased renal function, 28 dogs suffering from leishmaniasis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were treated with oral marbofloxacin at 2 mg/Kg/day for 28 days. During treatment dogs were assessed by performing weekly physical exams, measuring blood pressure and evaluating blood and urine parameters. Lymph node aspirations were also obtained at days 0 and 28. The global clinical score decreased significantly, from 6.2±3.4 to 4.7±3.1 (p = 0.0001), after treatment. Marbofloxacin also decreased parasitic load in 72% of the dogs. No significant differences in plasma creatinine, urine specific gravity, urinary concentrations of cystatin C, ferritin and urinary protein loss were detected during treatment. A transient but significant decrease in blood pressure was detected up to day 14 (from 180.1±36.6 to 166.0±32.7 mmHg; p = 0.016). Moreover, dogs showed a significant increase in plasma albumin concentration (from 15.0±5.2 to 16.6±3.9 g/L; p = 0.014) and a significant decrease in globulin concentration (from 59.0±18.1 to 54.1±18.0 g/L; p = 0.005). The results demonstrate that, in addition to being effective for treatment of CanL, marbofloxacin is a very safe drug in dogs with CKD and leishmaniasis."

In this study, ultrasound molecular imaging was performed to monitor the inflammation injuries in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis with microbubbles targeted to VCAM-1.Mice deficient for the apolipoprotein E (ApoE-/-mice) with high-cholesterol diet were studied as an age-dependent model of atherosclerosis. At 8, 16, 24, and 32 weeks of age, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) molecular imaging of proximal ascending aorta was performed with microbubbles targeted to VCAM-1. Plaque size, monocytes infiltration and the expression of VCAM-1 in the proximal ascending aorta were assessed by histology and western blot analysis, separately.In ApoE-/- mice, molecular imaging for VCAM-1 detected selective signal enhancement (P<0.01 versus non-targeted microbubbles) at all ages of ApoE-/- mice. Moreover, signals from targeted microbubbles increased from 8wks to 32wks age (P<0.05 for trend) in ApoE-/- mice, indicating the upregulation of VCAM-1 with the progression of atherosclerosis. Consistent with CEU imaging results, both western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed the expression of VCAM-1 and monocytes infiltration were age-dependent in ApoE-/- mice.CEU molecular imaging can be used to noninvasively detect the VCAM-1 expression on the endothelium in the progression of atherosclerosis. By investigating specific molecular biomarkers, it could help to monitor the inflammation and the progression of AS, which may in some extent contribute to the prediction of vulnerable plaque."

We hypothesized that Twitter real-time data would produce a unique and reproducible signal within minutes of multiple casualty events and we investigated the timing of the signal compared with other hospital disaster notification mechanisms.Using disaster specific search terms, all relevant tweets from the event to 7 days post-event were analyzed for 5 recent US based multiple casualty events (Boston Bombing [BB], SF Plane Crash [SF], Napa Earthquake [NE], Sandy Hook [SH], and Marysville Shooting [MV]). Quantitative and qualitative analysis of tweet utilization were compared across events.Over 3.8 million tweets were analyzed (SH 1.8 m, BB 1.1m, SF 430k, MV 250k, NE 205k). Peak tweets per min ranged from 209-3326. The mean followers per tweeter ranged from 3382-9992 across events. Retweets were tweeted a mean of 82-564 times per event. Tweets occurred very rapidly for all events (<2 mins) and represented 1% of the total event specific tweets in a median of 13 minutes of the first 911 calls. A 200 tweets/min threshold was reached fastest with NE (2 min), BB (7 min), and SF (18 mins). If this threshold was utilized as a signaling mechanism to place local hospitals on standby for possible large scale events, in all case studies, this signal would have preceded patient arrival. Importantly, this threshold for signaling would also have preceded traditional disaster notification mechanisms in SF, NE, and simultaneous with BB and MV.Social media data has demonstrated that this mechanism is a powerful, predictable, and potentially important resource for optimizing disaster response. Further investigated is warranted to assess the utility of prospective signally thresholds for hospital based activation."
https://openalex.org/W2761868521,"Emotional signals, like threatening sounds, automatically ready the perceiver to prepare an appropriate defense behavior. Conjecturing that this would manifest itself in extending the safety zone around the body we used the rubber hand illusion (RHI) to test this prediction. The RHI is a perceptual illusion in which body ownership is manipulated by synchronously stroking a rubber hand and real hand occluded from view. Many factors, both internal and external, have been shown to influence the strength of the illusion, yet the effect of emotion perception on body ownership remains unexplored. We predicted that listening to affective vocalizations would influence how strongly participants experience the RHI. In the first experiment four groups were tested that listened either to affective sounds (angry or happy vocalizations), non-vocal sounds or no sound while undergoing synchronous or asynchronous stroking of the real and rubber hand. In a second experiment three groups were tested comparing angry or neutral vocalizations and no sound condition. There was a significantly larger drift towards the rubber hand in the emotion versus the no emotion conditions. We interpret these results in the framework that the spatial increase in the RHI indicates that under threat the body has the capacity to extend its safety zone."
https://openalex.org/W2762087623,"The diversity of free-living nematodes in the beaches of two Antarctic islands, King George and Deception islands was investigated. We used morphological and molecular (LSU, and two fragments of SSU sequences) approaches to evaluate 236 nematodes. Specimens were assigned to at least genera using morphology and were assessed for the presence of cryptic speciation. The following genera were identified: Halomonhystera, Litoditis, Enoploides, Chromadorita, Theristus, Oncholaimus, Viscosia, Gammanema, Bathylaimus, Choanolaimus, and Paracanthonchus; along with specimens from the families Anticomidae and Linhomoeidae. Cryptic speciation was identified within the genera Halomonhystera and Litoditis. All of the cryptic species identified live sympatrically. The two cryptic species of Halomonhystera exhibited no significant morphological differences. However, Litoditis species 2 was significantly larger than Litoditis species 1. The utility of molecular data in confirming the identifications of some of the morphologically more challenging families of nematodes was demonstrated. In terms of which molecular sequences to use for the identification of free-living nematodes, the SSU sequences were more variable than the LSU sequences, and thus provided more resolution in the identification of cryptic speciation. Finally, despite the considerable amount of time and effort required to put together genetic and morphological data, the resulting advance in our understanding of diversity and ecology of free-living marine nematodes, makes that effort worthwhile."
https://openalex.org/W2762144719,"Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), is the most important bacterial disease in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Our previous studies have revealed that the bacterial blight resistance gene Xa23 from wild rice O. rufipogon Griff. confers the broadest-spectrum resistance against all the naturally occurring Xoo races. As a novel executor R gene, Xa23 is transcriptionally activated by the bacterial avirulence (Avr) protein AvrXa23 via binding to a 28-bp DNA element (EBEAvrXa23) in the promoter region. So far, the evolutionary mechanism of Xa23 remains to be illustrated. Here, a rice germplasm collection of 97 accessions, including 29 rice cultivars (indica and japonica) and 68 wild relatives, was used to analyze the evolution, phylogeographic relationship and association of Xa23 alleles with bacterial blight resistance. All the ~ 473 bp DNA fragments consisting of promoter and coding regions of Xa23 alleles in the germplasm accessions were PCR-amplified and sequenced, and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the promoter regions (~131 bp sequence upstream from the start codon ATG) of Xa23/xa23 alleles while only two SNPs were found in the coding regions. The SNPs in the promoter regions formed 5 haplotypes (Pro-A, B, C, D, E) which showed no significant difference in geographic distribution among these 97 rice accessions. However, haplotype association analysis indicated that Pro-A is the most favored haplotype for bacterial blight resistance. Moreover, SNP changes among the 5 haplotypes mostly located in the EBE/ebe regions (EBEAvrXa23 and corresponding ebes located in promoters of xa23 alleles), confirming that the EBE region is the key factor to confer bacterial blight resistance by altering gene expression. Polymorphism analysis and neutral test implied that Xa23 had undergone a bottleneck effect, and selection process of Xa23 was not detected in cultivated rice. In addition, the Xa23 coding region was found highly conserved in the Oryza genus but absent in other plant species by searching the plant database, suggesting that Xa23 originated along with the diversification of the Oryza genus from the grass family during evolution. This research offers a potential for flexible use of novel Xa23 alleles in rice breeding programs and provide a model for evolution analysis of other executor R genes."
https://openalex.org/W2762570858,"Cytokinesis is the last stage in the cell cycle. In prokaryotes, the protein FtsZ guides cell constriction by assembling into a contractile ring-shaped structure termed the Z-ring. Constriction of the Z-ring is driven by the GTPase activity of FtsZ that overcomes the energetic barrier between two protein conformations having different propensities to assemble into polymers. FtsZ is found in psychrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic organisms thereby functioning at temperatures ranging from subzero to >100°C. To gain insight into the functional adaptations enabling assembly of FtsZ in distinct environmental conditions, we analyzed the energetics of FtsZ function from mesophilic Escherichia coli in comparison with FtsZ from thermophilic Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. Presumably, the assembly may be similarly modulated by temperature for both FtsZ orthologs. The temperature dependence of the first-order rates of nucleotide hydrolysis and of polymer disassembly, indicated an entropy-driven destabilization of the FtsZ-GTP intermediate. This destabilization was true for both mesophilic and thermophilic FtsZ, reflecting a conserved mechanism of disassembly. From the temperature dependence of the critical concentrations for polymerization, we detected a change of opposite sign in the heat capacity, that was partially explained by the specific changes in the solvent-accessible surface area between the free and polymerized states of FtsZ. At the physiological temperature, the assembly of both FtsZ orthologs was found to be driven by a small positive entropy. In contrast, the assembly occurred with a negative enthalpy for mesophilic FtsZ and with a positive enthalpy for thermophilic FtsZ. Notably, the assembly of both FtsZ orthologs is characterized by a critical concentration of similar value (1–2 μM) at the environmental temperatures of their host organisms. These findings suggest a simple but robust mechanism of adaptation of FtsZ, previously shown for eukaryotic tubulin, by adjustment of the critical concentration for polymerization."

The present study aimed to clarify whether body mass and lifestyle are associated with cognitive impairment in Japanese middle-aged and elderly individuals.Subjects were 1814 community-dwelling individuals aged 44-79 years, all of whom were participants of the Murakami Cohort Study baseline survey conducted in 2011-2013. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in 2014-2016, and cognitive impairment, the outcome measure, was defined as an MMSE score <24. Predictor variables were body mass index (BMI), long-term weight changes from 20 years of age, and lifestyle factors, such as smoking, drinking, and physical activity levels, which were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire in the baseline survey. Covariates were sex, age, education level, and histories of stroke and diabetes. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs).The prevalence of overall cognitive impairment was 6.2%. The adjusted ORs of cognitive impairment in the lowest (<[-4]kg) (OR = 2.70, 95%CI, 1.18-6.20) and second ([-4]-[0]kg) (OR = 2.37, 95%CI, 1.04-5.37) quintiles for long-term weight change were significantly higher than the reference 4th quintile ([+4]-[+7]kg). The adjusted OR in the highest quintile (≥[+8]kg) was 2.24 (95%CI, 0.99-5.04).

Sixteen controls underwent an experimental session where electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded at baseline (resting) and during a motor task (hand movements). GBA was obtained from the EEG data at baseline and during the task. Index of plasticity (IP) was defined as the relationship between GBA at the end of the motor task (GBAM_FIN), divided by GBA at the beginning of the task (GBAM_INI) for movements of both hands. There was a significant increase in GBA at the end of the task, compared to the initial GBA for the motor task (GBAM_FIN > GBAM_INI). No differences were found at baseline (GBAB_FIN ≈ GBAB_INI). Individual IP values had a positive (r = 0.624) and significant correlation with subject's handedness. Due to plastic changes, GBA could indirectly but objectively reveal changes in cerebral activity related to physical training. This method could be used as a future diagnostic test in the follow-up of patients undergoing rehabilitation. It could also have potential applications in the fields of sports medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2764188165,"Introduction Uptake of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) as an intervention for prevention of HIV acquisition has been low among men aged ≥25 years in Nyanza region, western Kenya. We conducted a baseline survey of the prevalence and predictors of VMMC among men ages 25–39 years as part of the preparations for a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) called the Target, Speed and Coverage (TASCO) Study. The TASCO Study aimed to assess the impact of two demand creation interventions—interpersonal communication (IPC) and dedicated service outlets (DSO), delivered separately and together (IPC + DSO)—on VMMC uptake. Methods As part of the preparatory work for implementation of the cRCT to evaluate tailored interventions to improve uptake of VMMC, we conducted a survey of men aged 25–39 years from a traditionally non-circumcising Kenyan ethnic community within non-contiguous locations selected as study sites. We determined their circumcision status, estimated the baseline circumcision prevalence and assessed predictors of being circumcised using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results A total of 5,639 men were enrolled of which 2,851 (50.6%) reported being circumcised. The odds of being circumcised were greater for men with secondary education (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.45–1.86, p<0.001), post-secondary education (aOR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.44–2.06, p <0.001), and those employed (aOR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.18–1.47, p <0.001). However, the odds were lower for men with a history of being married (currently married, divorced, separated, or widowed). Conclusion Among adult men in the rural Nyanza region of Kenya, men with post-primary education and employed were more likely to be circumcised. VMMC programs should focus on specific sub-groups of men, including those aged 25–39 years who are married, divorced/separated/ widowed, and of low socio-economic status (low education and unemployed)."

We consider data that can be sorted out either way, through numbers of occurrences or size of the measures, as it is the case, say, of moon craters, earthquakes, billionaires, etc. We indicate that these two types of distributions are functional inverses of each other, and specify this link, first in terms of the assumed parent probability distribution that generates the data samples, and then in terms of an analog (deterministic) nonlinear iterated map that reproduces them. For the particular case of hyperbolic decay with rank the distributions are identical, that is, the classical Zipf plot, a pure power law. But their difference is largest when one displays logarithmic decay and its counterpart shows the inverse exponential decay, as it is the case of Benford law, or viceversa. For all intermediate decay rates generic differences appear not only between the power-law exponents for the midway rank decline but also for small and large rank. We extend the theoretical framework to include thermodynamic and statistical-mechanical concepts, such as entropies and configuration."

The majority of these interactions can be attributed to the extensive intracellular C termini unique to KNa channel subunits, which house several consensus sites for phosphorylation by kinases (7Joiner W.J.

For example, PKC phosphorylation of Ser407 in the hinge region between the S6 transmembrane domain and the first RCK domain produces a constitutively active phenotype in Slack channels that mimics known KCNT1 mutations associated with malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (12Barcia G.

In the distal C terminus, phosphorylation by p38 MAPK is required for tonic conductance and surface expression of neuronal Slack channels, prevention of which causes significant reduction in total neuronal IK (9Gururaj S.

Slack sodium-activated potassium channel membrane expression requires p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation.Neuropharmacology. 2016; 103: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Finally, the abovementioned indirect regulatory effect of PKA on Slack channels resulting in DRG neuronal hyperexcitability is bolstered by the fact that four of the five known PKA consensus sites are located outside the RCK domains (7Joiner W.J. Tang M.D. Wang L.Y. Dworetzky S.I. Boissard C.G. Gan L. Gribkoff V.K. Kaczmarek L.K.

Taken together, this body of work on Slack channel regulation describes the Slack C terminus as a hub for intracellular protein interactions that directly impact neuronal membrane excitability. The use of primary cultures of rat embryonic DRG neurons as a model system affords us with the unique ability to study native Slack channels in a state of endogenous abundance, because strong Slack immunolabeling has been demonstrated in >90% of intact DRG encompassing small- and medium-sized nociceptive neurons, as well as large-sized proprioceptive neurons (3Tamsett T.J. Picchione K.E. Bhattacharjee A. NAD+ activates KNa channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 5127-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In culture, the required presence of NGF for survival of embryonic neurons, as well as the anti-mitotic agent arabinoside-C to eliminate non-neuronal cell types, produces a homogenous TrkA+ nociceptive neuronal population that ubiquitously displays nearly identical membrane properties when electrophysiologically examined (13Barde Y.A.

Ther. 2008; 324: 1172-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, we exploit these properties of primary DRG neurons to establish AP-2 as a primary player in Slack KNa channel trafficking and, hence, sensory neuronal excitability. We found Slack channels to be targeted for AP-2 clathrin-dependent endocytosis following activation of the PKA signal via a direct interaction at the conserved dileucine motif in the Slack C terminus. Using a short peptide inhibitor of Slack–AP-2 binding derived from the recognition motif sequence, we provide conclusive evidence for PKA-induced internalization of Slack channels by AP-2 clathrin–mediated endocytosis (CME). The AP complexes are the most extensively characterized intracellular endocytic proteins. There are five AP complexes (AP1–5) in the cytoplasm of the mammalian cell, where each adaptor complex participates in a distinct intracellular trafficking route (15Park S.Y. Guo X. Adaptor protein complexes and intracellular transport.Biosci. Rep. 2014; 34: e00123Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Removal of proteins from the plasma membrane is exclusively carried out by the AP-2 complex via recruitment and assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles, which can transport internalized cargo into intracellular compartments such as early or late endosomes. Much like the other AP complexes, AP-2 uses specific binding motif sequences in cargo proteins as recognition signals, canonically categorized as tyrosine-based sequences (YXXΦ or NPXY, where X represents any amino acid, and Φ represents bulky hydrophobic amino acids) or dileucine-containing structures ((D/E)XXL(L/I)) (16Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Signals for sorting of transmembrane proteins to endosomes and lysosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). We asked whether the Slack channel is an AP-2 cargo protein by scanning the Slack C terminus protein sequence for these recognition motifs. We found a distally located dileucine motif (D/E)XXL(L/I) that conforms to the known AP-2 dileucine trafficking signal. Further, sequence alignment of the Slack C terminus across species revealed evolutionary conservation of the dileucine-binding motif, as well as complete conservation in the second KNa member subunit Slick (Fig. 1). Based on the high functional significance predicted by this observation, we hypothesized that the Slack KNa channel belongs to the repertoire of AP-2 cargo proteins. cAMP activation of PKA results in significant loss of membrane Slack channel protein in ∼30 min, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is likely trafficking involving cytoplasmic endocytic machinery (4Nuwer M.O. Picchione K.E. Bhattacharjee A. PKA-induced internalization of slack KNa channels produces dorsal root ganglion neuron hyperexcitability.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14165-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To identify interacting protein players downstream to the PKA signal that may serve endocytic functions, we performed a mass spectrometric analysis on a neuronal pulldown of Slack protein following treatment of primary DRG neurons with the potent PKA activator–cAMP analog Sp-cAMPs. Functional analysis of detected binding partners revealed the complete subset of adaptor protein subunits to comprise the AP-2 complex: α-, β-, σ-, and γ-adaptin (Table 1). In addition, both heavy and light chain clathrin subunits as well as the clathrin coat assembly protein AP180 were detected, representing important components essential for clathrin coat assembly and vesicle formation. In comparison, the complete subset of proteins essential for AP-2 clathrin–mediated endocytosis was not detected in the vehicle-treated sample, demonstrating the dependence of endocytic machinery recruitment on the PKA signal.Table 1Mass spectrometric identification of endocytic proteins associated with neuronal Slack channelsProteinNCBI accession no.Molecular massProtein coveragekDa%+ DMSO vehicle 14-3-3 scaffolding proteins 14-3-3 protein γ1433G_RAT2815.4+ Sp-cAMPs AP-2 adaptor complex AP-2 complex subunit α-2AP2A2_RAT10413.50 AP-2 complex subunit βAP2B1_RAT10513.30 AP-2 complex subunit μAP2M1_RAT5012.60 AP-2 complex subunit σAP2S1_RAT1721.10 Clathrin-coated vesicle proteins Clathrin heavy chain 1 Clathrin light chain BCLH1_RAT19230.00 Clathrin coat assembly proteinCLCB_RAT2512.20 AP180AP180_RAT9410.90 14-3-3 scaffolding proteins 14-3-3 protein ε1433E_RAT2941.20 14-3-3 protein ζ/δ1433Z_RAT2834.30 14-3-3 protein β/α1433B_RAT2826.00 14-3-3 protein η1433F_RAT2822.8 14-3-3 protein θ1433T_RAT2833.5 14-3-3 protein γ1433G_RAT2824.7 ELKS/Rab6-iAST family memberRB6I2_RAT10918.70 Regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis protein 1RIMS1_RAT1805.82 Flotillin-1FLOT1_RAT4732.20 Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein AVAPA_RAT2843.00 Neurabin-2NEB2_RAT909.06 ARF GTPase–activating protein GIT1GIT1_RAT8511.00 GTP-binding nuclear protein RanRAN_RAT2429.60 Coatomer subunit β′COPB2_RAT1035.52 ADP-ribosylation factor 5ARF5_RAT2130.00 Ras-related protein Rab-1BRAB1B_RAT2222.40 Protein transport protein Sec31ASC31A_RAT1353.36 DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1DNMT1_RAT1834.62 Protein unc-13 homolog CUN13C_RAT2491.54 Brefeldin A–inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein 2BIG2_RAT2023.13 Exocyst complex component 4EXOC4_RAT1113.18 Syntaxin-6STX6_RAT2921.20 Syntaxin-binding protein 1STXB1_RAT685.05 Synaptotagmin-1SYT1_RAT476.89 Synaptotagmin-11SYT11_RAT4810.00 Exocyst complex component 3EXOC3_RAT865.17 Membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW, and PDZ domain–containing protein 3MAGI3_RAT1613.67 Tripartite motif–containing protein 3TRIM3_RAT813.09 Vacuolar protein sorting–associated protein 4AVPS4A_RAT496.18 Coatomer subunit βCOPB_RAT1073.88 Synaptotagmin-5SYT5_RAT434.92 Open table in a new tab The ability of AP-2 to bind proteins destined for cytoplasmic internalization with high affinity and specificity while simultaneously recruiting clathrin molecules to phospholipid contacts at the membrane has been demonstrated as integral to the endocytic process (17Schmid E.M. McMahon H.T. Integrating molecular and network biology to decode endocytosis.Nature. 2007; 448: 883-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of the cargo recognition subunit σ-adaptin to bind Slack when recombinantly co-expressed in CHO cells via co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found significant association between the two proteins (Fig. 2A). To specifically ask whether the site of their interaction is the recognition motif in the Slack C terminus, the dileucine LI residues within the motif were substituted with alanines. Co-immunoprecipitation pulldowns performed on WT and mutant Slack channels showed significantly reduced AP-2 σ-Slack binding upon disruption of the trafficking signal (Fig. 2, B and C). We note that significant but not complete abolishment of binding is seen with disruption of dileucine motif binding, indicating that the motif is presumably the primary, if not the only, site of AP-2–Slack interaction. The observation of reduced membrane density of Slack channels as a consequence of cAMP-activation of PKA appears to not be limited to the neuronal membrane, because the same experiment performed on intact slices of the DRG-containing lumbar region of the spinal cord revealed significant loss of surface Slack channels (Fig. 3A). To address the involvement of AP-2 in this endocytic mechanism, we used a pharmacological disrupter of AP-2 binding to Slack channels. In brief, recently resolved crystal structure of the bound conformation of the AP-2 σ-adaptin used a short peptide to mimic the high-affinity binding event between the adaptin and the cargo protein at the dileucine motif (18Kelly B.T. McCoy A.J. Späte K. Miller S.E. Evans P.R. Höning S. Owen D.J. A structural explanation for the binding of endocytic dileucine motifs by the AP2 complex.Nature. 2008; 456: 976-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). This peptide was found to bind to the AP-2 complex with a KD of 650 nm. By modifying the membrane-impermeant peptide sequence with the naturally occurring post-translational modification myristoyl group at the N terminus (19Enseñat-Waser R. Martin F. Barahona F. Vazquez J. Soria B. Reig J.A. Direct visualization by confocal fluorescent microscopy of the permeation of myristoylated peptides through the cell membrane.IUBMB Life. 2002; 54: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we created a membrane permeable small peptide competitive inhibitor of Slack-AP-2 binding. Primary DRG neurons were then treated with a high dose of the inhibitor peptide to outcompete cargo proteins including Slack channels, thereby preventing AP-2 σ from binding to the dileucine recognition motif in the Slack C terminus. We first confirmed endogenous AP-2 and Slack channel interaction following PKA activation in primary DRG neurons as pulldowns of core adaptin AP-2 α contained significant Slack channel protein (Fig. 3C). Of note, we found tonic association of a small yet detectable density of channels with AP-2 (Fig. 3C, control lane), suggesting that a fraction of channels are likely in constant flux. Pharmacological treatments in primary neurons found that the inhibitory peptide disrupted binding, as confirmed by reduced amount of Slack pulled down with adaptin AP-2 α subsequent to PKA activation. We also tested the peptide effect on intact spinal cord slices by preincubating the slices with peptide for ∼2 h (to allow for maximum tissue permeation) before Sp-cAMPs treatment and found inconclusive effects on Slack channel endocytosis (data not shown). A likely explanation could be protease-mediated peptide degradation or dephosphorylation because intact tissue is favorable to robust enzyme activity. Next, we used the inhibitor to ask whether PKA internalization of membrane Slack channels is indeed mediated by AP-2. Consistent with previous evidence from biotinylation assays (4Nuwer M.O. Picchione K.E. Bhattacharjee A. PKA-induced internalization of slack KNa channels produces dorsal root ganglion neuron hyperexcitability.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14165-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we found treatment of primary DRG neurons with the potent PKA activator Sp-cAMPs to result in gradual loss of surface Slack protein over a duration of 30 min (Fig. 3B). When preincubated with the inhibitor peptide for 24 h before PKA activation, not all but most of the membrane Slack protein was retained at the membrane (Fig. 3D). Prevention of AP-2 binding to Slack appears to attenuate internalization of Slack channels and retain them at the membrane, implicating AP-2 as a central player in Slack channel endocytosis. Together, this biochemical evidence validates the signal-dependent recruitment of AP-2, as well as the preventative potential of the inhibitor peptide. If Slack channels were to undergo internalization by AP-2 clathrin–mediated endocytosis, membrane channels would be marked for inclusion in clathrin-coated vesicles by clathrin adaptors (20Popova N.V. Deyev I.E. Petrenko A.G. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis and adaptor proteins.Acta Naturae. 2013; 5: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We used immunofluorescence studies to investigate the involvement of clathrin in PKA-induced AP-2 internalization of Slack channels. In keeping with our findings thus far demonstrating PKA-dependent AP-2 recruitment to membrane Slack channels, we found significant AP-2 α-adaptin localization at the cell membrane following pharmacological activation of PKA in cultured primary DRG neurons (Fig. 4A). However, AP-2 recruitment to the membrane appears to be independent of cargo protein recognition, because nearly identical membrane immunolabeling of AP-2 α was observed in primary DRG neurons treated with control scrambled peptide (Fig. 4F). This could be explained by detectable amounts of AP-2 reported to always reside in the neighborhood of clathrin molecules and the cell membrane (21Boucrot E. Saffarian S. Zhang R. Kirchhausen T. Roles of AP-2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10597Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and although we observe no detectable clathrin co-localization under control conditions, AP-2 α membrane localization could be independent of intracellular and/or extracellular signals. More importantly, we found significant differences in localization of Slack channels and clathrin proteins between conditions of control and inhibitor peptide pretreatment (Fig. 4, A–M). Consistent with previous work, PKA activation dislocated Slack channels from the membrane into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C). As would be predicted, pretreatment with the inhibitor peptide abolished internalization of Slack channels as observed by strong absence of cytoplasmic labeling and retention of channels at the membrane (Fig. 4H). Finally, we observed clear clathrin localization at the membrane upon PKA activation in the absence of inhibitor peptide but not in its presence, suggesting that AP-2 binding to Slack channels necessarily precedes clathrin recruitment to the membrane (Fig. 4, B and G). This appears to be an extension of previous studies showing a severe reduction in formation of clathrin coats following RNAi depletion of AP-2 because of AP-2 μ being an integral part of the clathrin coat itself (21Boucrot E. Saffarian S. Zhang R. Kirchhausen T. Roles of AP-2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10597Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Taken together, our immunofluorescence findings show simultaneous AP-2 and clathrin localizing to the neuronal membrane and Slack channel redistribution into the cytoplasm following PKA activation, indicating that PKA internalization of Slack channels occurs via AP-2 clathrin endocytosis. cAMP acts as an important second messenger during inflammation in mammalian neurons, actively initiating downstream signaling cascades via classical cAMP-dependent PKA phosphorylation of protein targets (22Cheng X. Ji Z. Tsalkova T. Mei F. Epac and PKA: a tale of two intracellular cAMP receptors.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin (Shanghai). 2008; 40: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous findings, treatment of primary DRG neurons with the PKA activator Sp-cAMPs induced membrane hyperexcitability, defined as repetitive firing of more than two action potentials in whole cell current clamp recordings upon injection of a suprathreshold current (Fig. 5, A and B). Preincubation of neurons with the inhibitor peptide prior to activation of PKA appeared to produce a state of firing accommodation and prevent hyperexcitability, as would be expected in the event that AP-2–mediated trafficking of Slack channels from the neuronal membrane is the mechanism underlying PKA-induced hyperexcitability. Similar experiments performed on acutely dissociated adult mouse DRG neurons recapitulated these findings to a large extent (Fig. 5C), although less robust in response to pharmacological treatments of the cAMP analog and the inhibitor peptide. Although the latter result validates the physiological relevance of our embryonic neuronal culture model, as well as the reproducible pharmacological effect of the peptide across model systems, we attribute the lack of statistical significance to well documented heterogeneity and perils associated with acutely dissociated adult DRG neurons (23Zheng J.H. Walters E.T. Song X.J. Dissociation of dorsal root ganglion neurons induces hyperexcitability that is maintained by increased responsiveness to cAMP and cGMP.J. Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Slack channel function at the neuronal membrane appears to rely heavily on surface channel density, which studies thus far have shown to be susceptible to influence by intracellular protein interactions. A strong example of this is provided by PKA regulation of Slack in that activation of the kinase causes internalization of channels in primary DRG neurons, causing them to become hyperexcitable (4Nuwer M.O. Picchione K.E. Bhattacharjee A. PKA-induced internalization of slack KNa channels produces dorsal root ganglion neuron hyperexcitability.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14165-14172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present study, we reveal AP-2 CME to be the trafficking mechanism underlying PKA internalization of Slack channels and add AP-2 to the growing list of cytoplasmic proteins interacting with Slack in a functionally significant manner. Based on the presence of an evolutionarily conserved dileucine motif, known recognition sequences for AP-2 binding, in the Slack C terminus, we hypothesized that PKA-induced changes in membrane channel density occurs via AP-2 endocytosis. Using mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we found both recombinantly expressed and endogenous Slack channels to directly bind AP-2 adaptins at the predicted dileucine-binding motif in th"

First, climate change-robust conservation management was defined using 11 principles and 44 criteria, which followed an approach similar to sustainability standards. We then evaluated the performance of individual management plans concerning the climate change-robustness framework. We found that climate change-robustness of protected areas hardly exceeded 50 percent of the potential performance, with most plans ranking in the lower quarter. Most Natura 2000 protected areas, established under conservation legislation of the European Union, belong to the sites with especially poor performance, with lower values in smaller areas. In general, the individual principles showed very different rates of accordance with our principles, but similarly low intensity. Principles with generally higher performance values included holistic knowledge management, public accountability and acceptance as well as systemic and strategic coherence. Deficiencies were connected to dealing with the future and uncertainty. Lastly, we recommended the presented principles and criteria as essential guideposts that can be used as a checklist for working towards more climate change-robust planning."

Thirty-two 8- week-old Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into four groups: control, 1-minute CN traction, 2-minute CN traction, and 2-minute CN crush. CN traction was performed using a glass hook with a tensile force of 0.2 Newton. One month later, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracavernosal pressure (ICP) in response to CN stimulation were measured to assess erectile function. The penis and major pelvic ganglion (MPG) were harvested to explore the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and neurofilament, fibrosis and apoptosis. The ICP/MAP ratio was reduced in the 2-minute CN traction group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The ICP/MAP ratio in the CN crush group was lower than in the other three groups (P < 0.05, for each). Expression of nNOS in both MPG and dorsal penile nerve was lower in the CN traction group than in the control group, but was higher than in the CN crush group (P < 0.05). Nerve fiber number in the dorsal penile nerve was reduced by 2-minute CN traction (P < 0.05). The ratios of collagen to smooth muscle content and the apoptosis were both increased the in 2-minute CN traction group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The findings indicate that CN traction is an effective CN injury model and the injury it caused is relatively mild compared with the CN crush model."

The aim of the study was to determine to what extent consumption of an average amount of grapefruit juice (250 ml) affected naringenin content in human milk. A total of 14 breastfeeding mothers were included in the study. The subjects remained on a diet with restricted intake of naringenin for a total of five days except on the third day, when they drank a single serving of 250 ml of grapefruit juice. A considerable subject-to-subject variability in naringenin content was observed in both initial and subsequent determinations. Baseline concentration values, which may reflect naringenin content in the milk produced by the breastfeeding mother who eat an everyday (unmodified) diet, ranged from 420.86 nmol/l to 1568.89 nmol/l, with a mean of 823.24 nmol/l. Switching to the modified diet resulted in a decrease in naringenin concentrations to the mean value of 673.89 nmol/l measured 48 hours after the switch. The highest mean values were observed four and 12 hours after consumption of the juice, equalling 908.25 nmol/l (SD ± 676.84 nmol/l) and 868.96 nmol/l (SD ± 665.54 nmol/l), respectively. Naringenin is commonly found in human milk in quantities expressed in nmol/l, and its concentrations vary from woman to woman. Consumption of 250 ml of red grapefruit juice by breastfeeding mothers does not significantly alter naringenin concentrations in their milk."

Nonetheless, eight out of the ten regions in Ghana remain predominantly rural where only 32% of the national health sector workforce works. Moreover, the rural-urban disparities in the density of health tutors (staff responsible for pre-service training of health professionals) are enormous. This paper explores perceived needs of health tutors in rural and urban health training institutions in Ghana.This is a descriptive qualitative study conducted in the Greater Accra and Northern regions of Ghana. The Study used the deductive thematic and sub-thematic analysis approaches. Five health training institutions were randomly sampled, and 72 tutors engaged in separate focus group discussions with an average size of 14 participants per group in each training institution.Perceived rural-urban disparities among health tutors were found in the payment of extra duty allowances; school infrastructure including libraries and internet connectivity; staff accommodation; and opportunities for scholarships and higher education. Health tutors in rural areas generally expressed more frustration with these work conditions than those in urban areas.There is the need to initiate and sustain work incentives that promote motivation of rural health tutors to control ongoing rural-urban migration of qualified staff. It is recommended the following incentives be prioritized to promote retention of qualified health tutors in rural health training schools: payment of research, book and rural allowances; early promotion of rural staff; prioritizing rural tutors for scholarships, and introduction of national best health tutor awards."

This fundamental issue has eluded a physical description so far. Our method is applied to describe hydrogen bonds (HB) in DNA base pairs. Numerical results reveal that base pairs in DNA could be equivalent considering HB strength contributions, which challenges previous interpretations of thermodynamic properties of DNA based on the assumption that Adenine/Thymine pairs are weaker than Guanine/Cytosine pairs due to the sole difference in the number of HB. Thus, our methodology provides solid foundations to support the development of extended models intended to go deeper into the molecular mechanisms of DNA functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2761287607,"The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe undergoes a switch from yeast to filamentous invasive growth in response to certain environmental stimuli. Among them is ammonium limitation. Amt1, one of the three ammonium transporters in this yeast, is required for the ammonium limitation-induced morphological transition; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be understood. Cells lacking Amt1 became capable of invasive growth upon increasing concentrations of ammonium in the medium, suggesting that the ammonium taken up into the cell or a metabolic intermediate in ammonium assimilation might serve as a signal for the ammonium limitation-induced morphological transition. To investigate the possible role of ammonium-metabolizing enzymes in the signaling process, deletion mutants were constructed for the gdh1, gdh2, gln1, and glt1 genes, which were demonstrated by enzyme assays to encode NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase, NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase, respectively. Growth tests on various nitrogen sources revealed that a gln1Δ mutant was a glutamine auxotroph and that a gdh1Δ mutant had a defect in growth on ammonium, particularly at high concentrations. The latter observation indicates that the NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase of S. pombe plays a major role in ammonium assimilation under high ammonium concentrations. Invasive growth assays showed that gdh1Δ and glt1Δ mutants underwent invasive growth to a lesser extent than did wild-type strains. Increasing the ammonium concentration in the medium suppressed the invasive growth defect of the glt1Δ mutant, but not the gdh1Δ mutant. These results suggest that the nitrogen status of the cell is important in the induction of filamentous invasive growth in S. pombe."

Differences between different inventory types, affect various levels of strategic, tactical and operational decision-making. In most articles, different levels of decision-making are discussed independently and sequentially.

Similarly, previous studies in our laboratory have shown that chow-fed mice lacking apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, the major protein in HDL, have low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations and smaller fetuses in midgestation. In the current study, we measured fetal weights in mice with varying levels of apoA-I gene dose (knockout, wild-type, and transgenic) and examined metabolic pathways known to affect fetal growth. As expected, we found the differences in apoA-I expression led to changes in HDL particle size and protein cargo as well as plasma cholesterol concentrations. Fetal masses correlated directly with maternal plasma cholesterol and apoA-I concentrations, but placental masses and histology did not differ between groups of mice. There was no significant difference in glucose or amino acid transport to the fetus or in expression levels of the glucose (glucose transporter 1 and 2) or amino acid (sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 and 2) transporters in whole placentas, although there was a trend for greater uptake of both nutrients in the whole fetal unit (fetus + placenta) of mice with greater apoA-I levels; significant differences in transport rates occurred when mice without apoA-I (knockout) vs. mice with apoA-I (wild-type and transgenic) were compared. Glucose tolerance tests were improved in the mice with the highest level of apoA-I, suggesting increased insulin-induced uptake of glucose by tissues of apoA-I transgenic mice. Thus, maternal HDL is associated with fetal growth, an effect that is likely mediated by plasma cholesterol or other HDL-cargo, including apolipoproteins or complement system proteins. A direct role of enhanced glucose and/or amino acid transport cannot be excluded.—Rebholz, S. L., Melchior, J. T., Davidson, W. S., Jones, H. N., Welge, J. A., Prentice, A. M., Moore, S.

Uterine neoplasms are categorised as epithelial, mesenchymal, mixed epithelial-mesenchymal or trophoblastic tumours. In this study we employed a mouse genetic approach using the MuLE lentiviral gene regulatory system to functionally test the ability of ecotropic lentiviruses to model epithelial and mesenchymal uterine malignancies ex vivo and in vivo. We discovered that MuLE lentiviruses efficiently infect uterine stromal cells but not endometrial epithelial cells when injected into the uterus of cycling, pseudopregnant or ovarectomized mice. Consistent with this cellular infection spectrum, we show that intra-uterine injection of ecotropic MuLE viruses expressing oncogenic HrasG12V together with knockdown of Cdkn2a induce high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas. These findings establish this approach as an efficient method of generating autochthonous mouse models of uterine sarcomas and in general for performing genetic manipulations of uterine stromal cells in vivo."
