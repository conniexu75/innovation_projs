To identify additional immune-inhibitory pathways in the prostate-tumor microenvironment, we evaluated untreated and ipilimumab-treated tumors from patients in a presurgical clinical trial. Levels of the PD-L1 and VISTA inhibitory molecules increased on independent subsets of macrophages in treated tumors. Our data suggest that VISTA represents another compensatory inhibitory pathway in prostate tumors after ipilimumab therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2601822003,"Paul Pharoah and colleagues report the results of a large genome-wide association study of ovarian cancer. They identify new susceptibility loci for different epithelial ovarian cancer histotypes and use integrated analyses of genes and regulatory features at each locus to predict candidate susceptibility genes, including OBFC1. To identify common alleles associated with different histotypes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we pooled data from multiple genome-wide genotyping projects totaling 25,509 EOC cases and 40,941 controls. We identified nine new susceptibility loci for different EOC histotypes: six for serous EOC histotypes (3q28, 4q32.3, 8q21.11, 10q24.33, 18q11.2 and 22q12.1), two for mucinous EOC (3q22.3 and 9q31.1) and one for endometrioid EOC (5q12.3). We then performed meta-analysis on the results for high-grade serous ovarian cancer with the results from analysis of 31,448 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, including 3,887 mutation carriers with EOC. This identified three additional susceptibility loci at 2q13, 8q24.1 and 12q24.31. Integrated analyses of genes and regulatory biofeatures at each locus predicted candidate susceptibility genes, including OBFC1, a new candidate susceptibility gene for low-grade and borderline serous EOC."
https://openalex.org/W2602986494,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have transformed our understanding of glioma susceptibility, but individual studies have had limited power to identify risk loci. We performed a meta-analysis of existing GWAS and two new GWAS, which totaled 12,496 cases and 18,190 controls. We identified five new loci for glioblastoma (GBM) at 1p31.3 (rs12752552; P = 2.04 × 10-9, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22), 11q14.1 (rs11233250; P = 9.95 × 10-10, OR = 1.24), 16p13.3 (rs2562152; P = 1.93 × 10-8, OR = 1.21), 16q12.1 (rs10852606; P = 1.29 × 10-11, OR = 1.18) and 22q13.1 (rs2235573; P = 1.76 × 10-10, OR = 1.15), as well as eight loci for non-GBM tumors at 1q32.1 (rs4252707; P = 3.34 × 10-9, OR = 1.19), 1q44 (rs12076373; P = 2.63 × 10-10, OR = 1.23), 2q33.3 (rs7572263; P = 2.18 × 10-10, OR = 1.20), 3p14.1 (rs11706832; P = 7.66 × 10-9, OR = 1.15), 10q24.33 (rs11598018; P = 3.39 × 10-8, OR = 1.14), 11q21 (rs7107785; P = 3.87 × 10-10, OR = 1.16), 14q12 (rs10131032; P = 5.07 × 10-11, OR = 1.33) and 16p13.3 (rs3751667; P = 2.61 × 10-9, OR = 1.18). These data substantiate that genetic susceptibility to GBM and non-GBM tumors are highly distinct, which likely reflects different etiology."
https://openalex.org/W2603648333,"Engineered genetic circuits for mammalian cells often require extensive fine-tuning to perform as intended. We present a robust, general, scalable system, called 'Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision' (BLADE), to engineer genetic circuits with multiple inputs and outputs in mammalian cells with minimal optimization. The reliability of BLADE arises from its reliance on recombinases under the control of a single promoter, which integrates circuit signals on a single transcriptional layer. We used BLADE to build 113 circuits in human embryonic kidney and Jurkat T cells and devised a quantitative, vector-proximity metric to evaluate their performance. Of 113 circuits analyzed, 109 functioned (96.5%) as intended without optimization. The circuits, which are available through Addgene, include a 3-input, two-output full adder; a 6-input, one-output Boolean logic look-up table; circuits with small-molecule-inducible control; and circuits that incorporate CRISPR-Cas9 to regulate endogenous genes. BLADE enables execution of sophisticated cellular computation in mammalian cells, with applications in cell and tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2601599637,"Dozens of proteins capture, polymerize and reshape the clathrin lattice during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). How or if this ensemble of proteins is organized in relation to the clathrin coat is unknown. Here, we map key molecules involved in CME at the nanoscale using correlative super-resolution light and transmission electron microscopy. We localize 19 different endocytic proteins (amphiphysin1, AP2, β2-arrestin, CALM, clathrin, DAB2, dynamin2, EPS15, epsin1, epsin2, FCHO2, HIP1R, intersectin, NECAP, SNX9, stonin2, syndapin2, transferrin receptor, VAMP2) on thousands of individual clathrin structures, generating a comprehensive molecular architecture of endocytosis with nanoscale precision. We discover that endocytic proteins distribute into distinct spatial zones in relation to the edge of the clathrin lattice. The presence or concentrations of proteins within these zones vary at distinct stages of organelle development. We propose that endocytosis is driven by the recruitment, reorganization and loss of proteins within these partitioned nanoscale zones."

We refer to these cells as nongrid spatial cells and confirmed that their spatial firing patterns were unrelated to running speed and highly reproducible within the same environment. However, in response to manipulations of environmental features, such as box shape or box color, nongrid spatial cells completely reorganized their spatial firing patterns. At the same time, grid cells retained their spatial alignment and predominantly responded with redistributed firing rates across their grid fields. Thus, mEC contains a joint representation of both spatial and environmental feature content, with specialized cell types showing different types of integrated coding of multimodal information.

The medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) is specialized for spatial information processing, with many neurons in the superficial layers displaying spatially and directionally selective firing (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T.

Among mEC cell types, grid cells show the most well-defined spatial firing fields, and, similar to place fields in the hippocampus (O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978O’Keefe J. Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon Press, 1978Google Scholar), the spatial firing locations of these fields are reliably reproduced when animals repeatedly explore the same environment (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M.

Moreover, grid cells respond to exploration of distinct environments with profound shifting of their spatial firing patterns and, concurrently, orthogonal hippocampal place cell maps are formed (“global remapping”) (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M.

Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Clarendon Press, 1978Google Scholar). In addition, aspects of an experience other than the location, such as timing, reward contingencies, or the appearance of an environment, are also discriminated by neuronal activity in mEC (Kraus et al., 2015Kraus B.J.

When examining the different types of spatial and nonspatial coding in mEC, past work has largely focused on the cell population as a whole, on anatomically defined cell types such as layer II stellate and pyramidal cells, or on only grid cells. For the entire mEC cell population, the reorganization of firing patterns is generally more pronounced in response to larger differences (with the exception of layer II pyramidal cells; Kitamura et al., 2015Kitamura T. Sun C. Martin J. Kitch L.J. Schnitzer M.J. Tonegawa S.

Visual landmarks sharpen grid cell metric and confer context specificity to neurons of the medial entorhinal cortex.eLife. 2016; 5https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16937Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This pattern is consistent with findings from only grid cells, for which large contextual changes elicit distinct spatial firing patterns and for which more minor manipulations of environmental features, such as the shape of its exterior or the color of its walls, do not alter the spatial firing patterns (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M. Hafting T. Treves A. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Hippocampal remapping and grid realignment in entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2007; 446: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Yet less is known about the responses of nongrid mEC cells to manipulations of environments. It is feasible that nongrid cells show major reorganization along with the realignment of grid cells, but only minor responses when the grid pattern is stable. In the latter case, discrimination between environmental features could thus be predominantly performed by the hippocampus in response to lateral entorhinal cortex (lEC) input (Lu et al., 2013Lu L. Leutgeb J.K. Tsao A. Henriksen E.J. Leutgeb S. Barnes C.A. Witter M.P. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Impaired hippocampal rate coding after lesions of the lateral entorhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that mEC cells other than grid cells contribute to distinguishing between environmental features. To examine this possibility, we performed single-unit recordings from the superficial layers of dorsal mEC without biasing our sampling for a particular cell type. By subsequently classifying all recorded entorhinal cells and analyzing cell classes separately, we could identify whether feature discrimination was performed by distributed mEC networks, irrespective of functional cell type, or whether spatial location information and environmental feature information were preferentially represented by particular functional cell types. Using 10 min sessions of random foraging, we sorted all recorded mEC cells (n = 345 cells in 7 rats; Figure S1) into distinct functional cell classes including grid, border, nongrid spatial (reliable spatial firing but not in a grid pattern or along a border), pure head direction (HD; heading-modulated firing but no spatial firing), and nonspatial cells (otherwise uncategorized). For mEC recordings, classification has previously been performed by first calculating descriptive values for each cell class (grid score, border score, spatial information, and HD mean resultant length) and by then comparing the values to those calculated from the shuffled data of all recorded mEC cells pooled together (Figure S2A) (Barry et al., 2012Barry C.

However, pooling shuffled data across all cells fails to account for the firing statistics of individual cells, most notably the relationship between a cell’s firing rate and its spatial information (Figure S2B) (Rolls et al., 1997Rolls E.T.

Thus, to consider the characteristics of individual cells and more closely follow methods that have been used to define hippocampal place cells as spatially precise and consistent (Aghajan et al., 2015Aghajan Z.M.

Kubie J.L. Ranck Jr., J.B. Spatial firing patterns of hippocampal complex-spike cells in a fixed environment.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1935-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we generated shuffled data for each cell independently. For identifying cells as spatial we then required that a cell’s spatial information and its correlation between the first and second halves of a recording session were both above the 95th percentile of the corresponding measurements taken from the same cell’s shuffled data. Using these criteria, a large majority (∼95%) of mEC cells was classified as spatial (Figure 1A), including numerous cells that would previously have been identified as nonspatial (Figure S2C). The proportions of cells with specialized spatial firing patterns were comparable to previous reports (grid cells, 17.7%; border cells, 9.3%) (Kropff et al., 2015Kropff E. Carmichael J.E. Moser M.B.

We refer to the latter type as nongrid spatial cells (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1) and confirmed that their spatial firing patterns did not arise from systematic variation in running speed. First, all nongrid spatial cells remained classified as nongrid spatial when using firing rate maps that excluded periods of low running speed (<5 cm/s). Second, we found no relation between running speed patterns and cells’ firing rate patterns (Figure S1). Given that nongrid spatial cells were the most numerous cell type in mEC, we sought to determine whether they responded coherently with or distinctly from grid cells to manipulations of box shape, box color, and box location. We began by reproducing previously reported results for grid cells that showed retained grid alignment across manipulations of environmental features (i.e., box shape and box color), but major shifts across different box locations (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M. Hafting T. Treves A. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Hippocampal remapping and grid realignment in entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2007; 446: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). Our experiments thus repeated these paradigms (Figure 2A). For the shape-change manipulation, recordings consisted of four 10 min sessions during which rats randomly foraged in an enclosure that remained at a fixed location within a room. Using flexible walls, the enclosure was shaped as a circle during two sessions and as a square during two sessions. For the color-change manipulation, recordings were performed in a second, different room using a square enclosure. The enclosure again remained at a fixed location within the room, and its walls were black for two sessions and white for two sessions. Because the shape-change and color-change manipulations were performed in separate rooms, cells that were recorded in both rooms were used to evaluate the response of mEC cells to changes in box location. We first confirmed that ensembles of grid cells retained stable spatial maps within the shape-change and color-change paradigms. For each rat and paradigm, we generated the population vector (PV) for the set of recorded grid cells (shape change, 2–7 grid cells from 6 rats; color change, 2–21 grid cells from 3 rats) and calculated the PV cross-correlation between pairs of sessions. For the color-change paradigm in one additional rat, only one grid cell was recorded, and we thus used the cell’s spatial cross-correlation. In the resulting correlation matrices, the displacement of the most central peak from the origin was used to measure the spatial alignment of the grid patterns (Figures S3A and S3B). As previously reported for feature manipulations (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M. Hafting T. Treves A. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Hippocampal remapping and grid realignment in entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2007; 446: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), the spatial firing of grid cell ensembles remained stable across manipulations of either box shape or color in the majority of rats (shape change, 6 of 6 rats; color change, 3 of 4 rats). Because we were specifically interested in mEC firing patterns under conditions when the spatial coding of grid cells remained stable, we further analyzed individual grid cells from datasets with stable grid maps (Figure 2B). We calculated spatial cross-correlations for each cell separately and again measured the displacement of the central peak (Figure 2C). As a baseline for the analysis across different box features or locations, we compared repeated recording sessions in matching environments. Across sessions in matching environments, grid cell displacement was minor (median displacement, 2.4 and 2.6 cm for matching box shape and color, respectively). Across different box shapes or box colors, we detected a small increase in displacement relative to matching conditions (median increase, 1.3 and 2.8 cm, p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively; Figure 2D). These increases were well below those that were detected across environments located in different rooms (median increase, 20.9 cm; Kruskal-Wallis comparing box shape, color, and location, chi-square (2) = 21.1, p < 0.001; post hoc location versus shape, p < 0.001; location versus color, p < 0.01). While we observed only minimal changes in the spatial firing patterns of grid cells in response to our manipulations, it is possible that the environmental change is instead represented by grid fields using a distributed rate code. Consistent with previous reports, we found only minor fluctuations in the firing rates within individual grid fields (Figure S3C) as opposed to the large rate changes characteristic of place fields (Fyhn et al., 2007Fyhn M.

Yet small differences in firing rates of individual grid nodes could be indicative of a coordinated rate redistribution across the fields of individual grid cells. We therefore performed two analyses that are well suited to detect rate differences across multiple firing fields. First, we calculated the mean firing rate within each grid field and entered these values into a rate vector for each grid cell and each 10 min session. By comparing the rate vectors across sessions (Figures 2E and 2F), we confirmed that the firing rates of a cell’s grid fields were similar between sessions in matching box shapes or colors (median Spearman’s rank correlation, 0.50 and 0.43, respectively). However, when comparing across different box shapes or colors, we found a significantly lower correlation of grid rate vectors (median correlation, 0.40 and 0.13; both p < 0.05 versus matching; Figure 2F), indicating that grid cell rate patterns became redistributed, in particular for manipulations of environment color where the correlation across different conditions was at chance levels (Mann-Whitney U different color versus shuffled field identity, z = 1.22, n.s. [not significant]). Second, we evaluated the overall similarity of the spatial maps of grid cells by calculating the spatial correlation between rate maps (Figure 2G). Although spatial correlation has frequently been used for confirming the spatial stability of cells’ firing patterns, it is also highly sensitive to a redistribution of firing rates across multiple fields. For grid cells, spatial correlations were high between repeated recordings with matching box shapes or colors (median spatial correlation, 0.85 and 0.70, respectively), but lower across different box shapes or colors (median correlation, 0.72 and 0.42, respectively; both p < 0.001 versus matching), again indicating that grid cell firing rates became redistributed in response to feature manipulations. After establishing that grid cells showed relatively stable spatial firing patterns along with a rate redistribution across grid fields, we proceeded to test whether nongrid spatial cells would show corresponding responses to feature manipulations (Figures 3A–3E). Nongrid spatial cells were defined based on stable spatial firing within a 10 min behavioral session (see Figure 1). We therefore expected that their spatial firing would also be reproducible over repeated 10 min recording sessions in matching environments. To confirm reproducible firing, we calculated the cross-correlation displacement and the spatial correlation between rate maps of each cell. For matching box shapes or colors, we found that cross-correlation displacements were small (median displacement, 4.4 and 4.7 cm, respectively) and that spatial correlations were high (median spatial correlation, 0.62 and 0.62, respectively). The firing patterns of mEC nongrid spatial cells were therefore reliable across repeated exploration of the same environment, though measurably below the values for grid cells (Mann-Whitney U grid versus nongrid spatial cells; displacement across matching shapes, z = −4.5, p < 0.001; colors, z = −3.2, p < 0.01; spatial correlation across matching shapes, z = −6.5, p < 0.001; colors, z = −2.4, p < 0.05). We then examined the consistency of the firing patterns of nongrid spatial cells across different environmental shapes or colors. Compared to sessions in matching conditions, nongrid spatial cells showed a median increase in displacement of 13.1 and 15.3 cm for shape and color change, respectively (both p < 0.001 versus matching), indicating a profound change in spatial firing location, but not reaching the level of displacement observed across rooms (median increase, 28.9 cm; Kruskal-Wallis comparing box shape, color, and location, chi-square (2) = 11.9, p < 0.01; post hoc location versus shape, p < 0.01; location versus color, p < 0.05). Measuring the spatial correlation yielded corresponding results with much lower correlations across different box shapes or colors (median spatial correlation, 0.29 and 0.26, respectively) compared to matching conditions (both p < 0.001). In fact, the degree of change elicited by feature manipulations was so substantial that response magnitudes overlapped with those produced by changing locations, limiting the ability of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to discriminate between these two highly distinct manipulations (Figure S3D). After finding in our full dataset that manipulations of environmental shape or color resulted in largely stable grid cell maps, but a pronounced reorganization of the firing patterns of nongrid spatial cells, we examined whether this pattern could also be observed in individual animals and in simultaneous recordings of grid and nongrid spatial cells. We found that grid cells responded less than nongrid spatial cells to feature manipulations in each subject (Figure 3F) and found that the differences between cell types were comparable to the full dataset when only analyzing simultaneously recorded ensembles of grid and nongrid spatial cells (Figure 4; Table S2). Furthermore, differences between grid and nongrid cells were also apparent when analyzing either layer II or III separately (Figure S1E). Taken together, the distinct responses of mEC grid and nongrid spatial cells to manipulations of environmental features occurred consistently across animals and in both superficial cell layers. In comprehensive recordings from mEC superficial layers, we found that ∼95% of mEC cells exhibited spatial firing patterns. Of these spatially selective cells, ∼20% were grid cells and ∼10% were border cells, while the remaining two-thirds (nongrid spatial cells) had less specialized, yet consistent spatial firing patterns. The classification of a much larger proportion of mEC cells as spatial compared to previous reports is based on applying criteria that have been widely used for hippocampal place cells.

https://openalex.org/W2601952071,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is crucial for accurate memory performance when prior knowledge interferes with new learning, but the mechanisms that minimize proactive interference are unknown. To investigate these, we assessed the influence of medial PFC (mPFC) activity on spatial learning and hippocampal coding in a plus maze task that requires both structures. mPFC inactivation did not impair spatial learning or retrieval per se, but impaired the ability to follow changing spatial rules. mPFC and CA1 ensembles recorded simultaneously predicted goal choices and tracked changing rules; inactivating mPFC attenuated CA1 prospective coding. mPFC activity modified CA1 codes during learning, which in turn predicted how quickly rats adapted to subsequent rule changes. The results suggest that task rules signaled by the mPFC become incorporated into hippocampal representations and support prospective coding. By this mechanism, mPFC activity prevents interference by ""teaching"" the hippocampus to retrieve distinct representations of similar circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W2597511687,"The Hippo pathway senses cellular conditions and regulates YAP/TAZ to control cellular and tissue homeostasis, while TBK1 is central for cytosolic nucleic acid sensing and antiviral defence. The correlation between cellular nutrient/physical status and host antiviral defence is interesting but not well understood. Here we find that YAP/TAZ act as natural inhibitors of TBK1 and are vital for antiviral physiology. Independent of transcriptional regulation and through the transactivation domain, YAP/TAZ associate directly with TBK1 and abolish virus-induced TBK1 activation, by preventing TBK1 Lys63-linked ubiquitylation and the binding of adaptors/substrates. Accordingly, YAP/TAZ deletion/depletion or cellular conditions inactivating YAP/TAZ through Lats1/2 kinases relieve TBK1 suppression and boost antiviral responses, whereas expression of the transcriptionally inactive YAP dampens cytosolic RNA/DNA sensing and weakens the antiviral defence in cells and zebrafish. Thus, we describe a function of YAP/TAZ and the Hippo pathway in innate immunity, by linking cellular nutrient/physical status to antiviral host defence."
https://openalex.org/W2602955340,"Brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs), also known as cancer stem cells, hijack high-affinity glucose uptake active normally in neurons to maintain energy demands. Here we link metabolic dysregulation in human BTICs to a nexus between MYC and de novo purine synthesis, mediating glucose-sustained anabolic metabolism. Inhibiting purine synthesis abrogated BTIC growth, self-renewal and in vivo tumor formation by depleting intracellular pools of purine nucleotides, supporting purine synthesis as a potential therapeutic point of fragility. In contrast, differentiated glioma cells were unaffected by the targeting of purine biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting selective dependence of BTICs. MYC coordinated the control of purine synthetic enzymes, supporting its role in metabolic reprogramming. Elevated expression of purine synthetic enzymes correlated with poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients. Collectively, our results suggest that stem-like glioma cells reprogram their metabolism to self-renew and fuel the tumor hierarchy, revealing potential BTIC cancer dependencies amenable to targeted therapy."

Naive cells can be obtained through primed-to-naive resetting, but there are no reliable methods to prospectively isolate unmodified naive cells during this process. Here we report comprehensive profiling of cell surface proteins by flow cytometry in naive and primed human PSCs. Several naive-specific, but not primed-specific, proteins were also expressed by pluripotent cells in the human preimplantation embryo. The upregulation of naive-specific cell surface proteins during primed-to-naive resetting enabled the isolation and characterization of live naive cells and intermediate cell populations. This analysis revealed distinct transcriptional and X chromosome inactivation changes associated with the early and late stages of naive cell formation. Thus, identification of state-specific proteins provides a robust set of molecular markers to define the human PSC state and allows new insights into the molecular events leading to naive cell resetting."

However, base-resolution landscapes of 5-formylcytosine (5fC) (an oxidized derivative of 5mC) at the single-cell level remain unexplored. Here, we present ""CLEVER-seq"" (chemical-labeling-enabled C-to-T conversion sequencing), which is a single-cell, single-base resolution 5fC-sequencing technology, based on biocompatible, selective chemical labeling of 5fC and subsequent C-to-T conversion during amplification and sequencing. CLEVER-seq shows intrinsic 5fC heterogeneity in mouse early embryos, Epi stem cells (EpiSCs), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). CLEVER-seq of mouse early embryos also reveals the highly patterned genomic distribution and parental-specific dynamics of 5fC during mouse early pre-implantation development. Integrated analysis demonstrates that promoter 5fC production precedes the expression upregulation of a clear set of developmentally and metabolically critical genes. Collectively, our work reveals the dynamics of active DNA demethylation during mouse pre-implantation development and provides an important resource for further functional studies of epigenetic reprogramming in single cells."

Near-infrared-light-inducible binding of bacterial phytochrome BphP1 to its natural PpsR2 partner is beneficial for simultaneous use with blue-light-activatable tools. However, applications of the BphP1-PpsR2 pair are limited by the large size, multidomain structure and oligomeric behavior of PpsR2. Here, we engineered a single-domain BphP1 binding partner, Q-PAS1, which is three-fold smaller and lacks oligomerization. We exploited a helix-PAS fold of Q-PAS1 to develop several near-infrared-light-controllable transcription regulation systems, enabling either 40-fold activation or inhibition. The light-induced BphP1-Q-PAS1 interaction allowed modification of the chromatin epigenetic state. Multiplexing the BphP1-Q-PAS1 pair with a blue-light-activatable LOV-domain-based system demonstrated their negligible spectral crosstalk. By integrating the Q-PAS1 and LOV domains in a single optogenetic tool, we achieved tridirectional protein targeting, independently controlled by near-infrared and blue light, thus demonstrating the superiority of Q-PAS1 for spectral multiplexing and engineering of multicomponent systems."

They further highlight a shared genetic architecture between mLOY and cancer susceptibility, and infer a causal effect of smoking on mLOY. The Y chromosome is frequently lost in hematopoietic cells, which represents the most common somatic alteration in men. However, the mechanisms that regulate mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY), and its clinical relevance, are unknown. We used genotype-array-intensity data and sequence reads from 85,542 men to identify 19 genomic regions (P < 5 × 10−8) that are associated with mLOY. Cumulatively, these loci also predicted X chromosome loss in women (n = 96,123; P = 4 × 10−6). Additional epigenome-wide methylation analyses using whole blood highlighted 36 differentially methylated sites associated with mLOY. The genes identified converge on aspects of cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation, including DNA synthesis (NPAT), DNA damage response (ATM), mitosis (PMF1, CENPN and MAD1L1) and apoptosis (TP53). We highlight the shared genetic architecture between mLOY and cancer susceptibility, in addition to inferring a causal effect of smoking on mLOY. Collectively, our results demonstrate that genotype-array-intensity data enables a measure of cell cycle efficiency at population scale and identifies genes implicated in aneuploidy, genome instability and cancer susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W2598011934,"The diverse migratory modes displayed by different cell types are generally believed to be idiosyncratic. Here we show that the migratory behaviour of Dictyostelium was switched from amoeboid to keratocyte-like and oscillatory modes by synthetically decreasing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate levels or increasing Ras/Rap-related activities. The perturbations at these key nodes of an excitable signal transduction network initiated a causal chain of events: the threshold for network activation was lowered, the speed and range of propagating waves of signal transduction activity increased, actin-driven cellular protrusions expanded and, consequently, the cell migratory mode transitions ensued. Conversely, innately keratocyte-like and oscillatory cells were promptly converted to amoeboid by inhibition of Ras effectors with restoration of directed migration. We use computational analysis to explain how thresholds control cell migration and discuss the architecture of the signal transduction network that gives rise to excitability."

Their analysis highlights the information-theoretic nature of the epigenome and provides a methodology for studying its role in disease and aging. Epigenetics is the study of biochemical modifications carrying information independent of DNA sequence, which are heritable through cell division. In 1940, Waddington coined the term “epigenetic landscape” as a metaphor for pluripotency and differentiation, but methylation landscapes have not yet been rigorously computed. Using principles from statistical physics and information theory, we derive epigenetic energy landscapes from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data that enable us to quantify methylation stochasticity genome-wide using Shannon's entropy, associating it with chromatin structure. Moreover, we consider the Jensen–Shannon distance between sample-specific energy landscapes as a measure of epigenetic dissimilarity and demonstrate its effectiveness for discerning epigenetic differences. By viewing methylation maintenance as a communications system, we introduce methylation channels and show that higher-order chromatin organization can be predicted from their informational properties. Our results provide a fundamental understanding of the information-theoretic nature of the epigenome that leads to a powerful approach for studying its role in disease and aging."

However, their underlying pathomechanisms and regulation of RAN translation remain unknown. We report that expression of expanded UGGAA (UGGAAexp) repeats, responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) in Drosophila, causes neurodegeneration accompanied by accumulation of UGGAAexp RNA foci and translation of repeat-associated pentapeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, consistent with observations in SCA31 patient brains. We revealed that motor-neuron disease (MND)-linked RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2B1, bind to and induce structural alteration of UGGAAexp. These RBPs suppress UGGAAexp-mediated toxicity in Drosophila by functioning as RNA chaperones for proper UGGAAexp folding and regulation of PPR translation. Furthermore, nontoxic short UGGAA repeat RNA suppressed mutated RBP aggregation and toxicity in MND Drosophila models. Thus, functional crosstalk of the RNA/RBP network regulates their own quality and balance, suggesting convergence of pathomechanisms in microsatellite expansion disorders and RBP proteinopathies."

https://openalex.org/W2598645546,"Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the direct causative effect of COX-2 in spontaneous HCC formation remains unknown. We thus investigate the role and molecular pathogenesis of COX-2 in HCC by using liver-specific COX-2 transgenic (TG) mice. We found spontaneous HCC formation with elevated inflammatory infiltrates and neovessels in male TG mice (3/21, 14.3%), but not in any of male WT mice (0/19). Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and gene expression microarrays were performed in the HCC tumor and non-HCC liver tissues to investigate the molecular mechanisms of COX-2-driven HCC. By RRBS, DNA promoter hypermethylation was identified in HCC from TG mice. Induction of promoter hypermethylation was associated with reduced tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) expression by COX-2. TET1 could catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and prevents DNA hypermethylation. In keeping with this, loss of 5hmC was demonstrated in COX-2-induced HCC. Consistently, COX-2 overexpression in human HCC cell lines could reduce both TET1 expression and 5hmc levels. Integrative analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression profiles further identified significantly downregulated genes including LTBP1, ADCY5 and PRKCZ by promoter methylation in COX-2-induced HCC. Reduced expression of LTBP1, ADCY5 and PRKCZ by promoter hypermethylation was further validated in human HCCs. Bio-functional investigation revealed that LTBP1 inhibited cell proliferation in HCC cell lines, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor in HCC. Gene expression microarrays revealed that signaling cascades (AKT (protein kinase B), STK33 (Serine/Threonine kinase 33) and MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathways) were enriched in COX-2-induced HCC. In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time that enhanced COX-2 expression in hepatocytes is sufficient to induce HCC through inducing promoter hypermethylation by reducing TET1, silencing tumor-suppressive genes and activating key oncogenic pathways. Inhibition of COX-2 represents a mechanism-based target for HCC prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2602818789,"During embryonic development, mechanical forces are essential for cellular rearrangements driving tissue morphogenesis. Here, we show that in the early zebrafish embryo, friction forces are generated at the interface between anterior axial mesoderm (prechordal plate, ppl) progenitors migrating towards the animal pole and neurectoderm progenitors moving in the opposite direction towards the vegetal pole of the embryo. These friction forces lead to global rearrangement of cells within the neurectoderm and determine the position of the neural anlage. Using a combination of experiments and simulations, we show that this process depends on hydrodynamic coupling between neurectoderm and ppl as a result of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion between those tissues. Our data thus establish the emergence of friction forces at the interface between moving tissues as a critical force-generating process shaping the embryo."

Symmetrical division is the best characterized mechanism of stem cell replacement, but other mechanisms could also be deployed, particularly in situations of high stress. Here, we show that after severe depletion, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the Drosophila midgut are replaced by spindle-independent ploidy reduction of cells in the enterocyte lineage through a process known as amitosis. Amitosis is also induced by the functional loss of ISCs coupled with tissue demand and in aging flies, underscoring the generality of this mechanism. However, we also found that random homologous chromosome segregation during ploidy reduction can expose deleterious mutations through loss of heterozygosity. Together, our results highlight amitosis as an unappreciated mechanism for restoring stem cell homeostasis, but one with some associated risk in animals carrying mutations."

Moreover, we discovered that NDRG1 reduces caveolin-1 protein expression through promoting its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation via the proteasome in CRC cells.

SerpinB2 expression, particularly in the stromal compartment, is associated with reduced metastasis and prolonged survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and our genomic analysis revealed that SERPINB2 is frequently deleted in PDAC. We show that SerpinB2 is required by stromal cells for normal collagen remodelling in vitro, regulating fibroblast interaction and engagement with collagen in the contracting matrix. In a pancreatic cancer allograft model, co-injection of PDAC cancer cells and SerpinB2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) resulted in increased tumour growth, aberrant remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and increased local invasion from the primary tumour. These tumours also displayed elevated proteolytic activity of the primary biochemical target of SerpinB2-urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). In a large cohort of patients with resected PDAC, we show that increasing uPA mRNA expression was significantly associated with poorer survival following pancreatectomy. This study establishes a novel role for SerpinB2 in the stromal compartment in PDAC invasion through regulation of stromal remodelling and highlights the SerpinB2/uPA axis for further investigation as a potential therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer."

We provide evidence that DBI is expressed in stem cells in all neurogenic niches of the postnatal brain. Focusing on the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) and employing multiple genetic manipulations in vivo, we demonstrate that DBI regulates the balance between preserving the stem cell pool and neurogenesis. Specifically, DBI dampens GABA activity in stem cells, thereby sustaining the proproliferative effect of physical exercise and enriched environment.

The mechanism underlying how CRPC gains resistance toward hormone depletion and other forms of chemotherapy is poorly understood. Research on understanding the factors that drive these processes is desperately needed to generate new therapies to cure the disease. Here, we discovered a fundamental role of S-phase protein kinase 2 (Skp2) in the formation and progression of CRPC. In transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate model, Skp2 depletion leads to a profound repression of prostate tumor growth and distal metastasis and substantially prolonged overall survival. We revealed that Skp2 regulates CRPC through Twist-mediated oncogenic functions including epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) acquisitions. Mechanistically, Skp2 interacted with Twist and promoted the non-degradative ubiquitination of Twist. Consequently, Skp2 stabilized Twist protein expression by preventing proteasomal degradation of Twist by β-TrCP. We found that Twist overexpression augments CSC self-renewal and population and that Skp2 inhibition reverts Twist’s effects on CSC regulation. Furthermore, genetically depleting or pharmacologically inactivating Skp2 synergistically re-sensitized CRPC cells toward chemotherapies such as paclitaxel or doxorubicin. Together, this study uncovering Skp2-mediated Twist stabilization and oncogenic functions in CRPC offers new knowledge on how CRPC progresses and acquires chemoresistance during tumor progression. It provides proof of principle that Skp2 targeting is a promising approach to combat metastatic CRPC by targeting Twist and CSCs."

Obesity-associated insulin resistance plays a central role in type 2 diabetes. As such, tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate the insulin receptor (IR) are potential therapeutic targets. The low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP) is a proposed IR phosphatase, yet its role in insulin signaling in vivo has not been defined. Here we show that global and liver-specific LMPTP deletion protects mice from high-fat diet-induced diabetes without affecting body weight. To examine the role of the catalytic activity of LMPTP, we developed a small-molecule inhibitor with a novel uncompetitive mechanism, a unique binding site at the opening of the catalytic pocket, and an exquisite selectivity over other phosphatases. This inhibitor is orally bioavailable, and it increases liver IR phosphorylation in vivo and reverses high-fat diet-induced diabetes. Our findings suggest that LMPTP is a key promoter of insulin resistance and that LMPTP inhibitors would be beneficial for treating type 2 diabetes."

However, both the metabolic perturbation and molecular context of L-asparaginase-treated ALL cells has not been fully elucidated. Here we identify that treatment with L-asparaginase results in metabolic shutdown via the reduction of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by mitochondrial damage and activation of autophagy. The autophagy is involved in reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) level by eliminating injured mitochondria. Inhibition of autophagy enhances L-asparaginase-induced cytotoxicity and overcomes the acquired resistance to L-asparaginase in ALL cells.

Intriguingly, mutant mice that received Dox postnatally (luMob1DKO (P21–41) mice) did not develop spontaneous lung adenocarcinomas, and urethane treatment-induced lung tumour formation was decreased (rather than increased). Lungs of luMob1DKO (P21–41) mice exhibited increased detachment of bronchiolar epithelial cells and decreased numbers of the bronchioalveolar stem cells thought to initiate lung adenocarcinomas. YAP1/TAZ-NKX2.1-dependent expression of collagen XVII, a key hemidesmosome component, was also reduced.

Tachykinin receptor neurokinin-1 (NK1R) is a promising target in glioblastoma therapy because of its overexpression in human glioblastoma. NK1R agonists promote glioblastoma cell growth, whereas NK1R antagonists efficiently inhibit cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects are incompletely understood. β-Arrestins (ARRBs) serve as scaffold proteins and adapters to mediate intracellular signal transduction. Here we show that the ARRB1-mediated signaling pathway is essential for NK1-mediated glioblastoma cell proliferation. ARRB1 knockdown significantly inhibited NK1-mediated glioblastoma cell proliferation and induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. ARRB1 knockdown cells showed remarkable down-regulation of CDC25C/CDK1/cyclin B1 activity. We also demonstrated that ARRB1 mediated prolonged phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in glioblastoma cells induced by NK1R activation. ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation are involved in regulating CDC25C/CDK1/cyclin B1 activity. The lack of long-term ERK1/2 and Akt activation in ARRB1 knockdown cells was at least partly responsible for the delayed cell cycle progression and proliferation. Moreover, we found that ARRB1-mediated ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation regulated the transcriptional activity of both NF-κB and AP-1, which were involved in cyclin B1 expression. ARRB1 deficiency increased the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to the treatment of NK1R antagonists. Taken together, our results suggest that ARRB1 plays an essential role in NK1R-mediated cell proliferation and G2/M transition in glioblastoma cells. Interference with ARRB1-mediated signaling via NK1R may have potential significance for therapeutic strategies targeting glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor and has a poor prognosis. Tachykinin receptor neurokinin-1 (NK1R) is a promising target in glioblastoma therapy because of its overexpression in human glioblastoma. NK1R agonists promote glioblastoma cell growth, whereas NK1R antagonists efficiently inhibit cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects are incompletely understood. β-Arrestins (ARRBs) serve as scaffold proteins and adapters to mediate intracellular signal transduction.

ARRB1 knockdown significantly inhibited NK1-mediated glioblastoma cell proliferation and induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest.

https://openalex.org/W2597569211,"The understanding of the dynamic of soil-borne diseases is related to the microbial composition of the rhizosphere which is the key to progress in the field of biological control. Trichoderma spp. is commonly used as a biological control agent. The use of next generation sequencing approaches and quantitative PCR are two successful approaches to assess the effect of using compost as substrate fortified with two Trichoderma strains (Trichoderma harzianum or Trichoderma asperellum) on bacterial and fungal communities in pepper rhizosphere infected with Phytophthora nicotianae. The results showed changes in the bacterial rhizosphere community not attributed to the Trichoderma strain, but to the pathogen infection, while, fungi were not affected by pathogen infection and depended on the type of substrate. The Trichoderma asperellum fortified compost was the most effective combination against the pathogen. This could indicate that the effect of fortified composts is greater than compost itself and the biocontrol effect should be attributed to the Trichoderma strains rather than the compost microbiota, although some microorganisms could help with the biocontrol effect."

Whether functional impairment of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) innervation to tissues of the abdominal cavity reduce circulating concentrations of triglyceride (TG) and VLDL particles (VLDL-P) was tested in men with spinal cord injury (SCI).One hundred-three non-ambulatory men with SCI [55 subjects with neurologic injury at or proximal to the 4th thoracic vertebrae (↑T4); 48 subjects with SCI at or distal to the 5th thoracic vertebrae (↓T5)] and 53 able-bodied (AB) subjects were studied. Fasting blood samples were obtained for determination of TG, VLDL-P concentration by NMR spectroscopy, serum glucose by autoanalyzer, and plasma insulin by radioimmunoassay. VAT volume was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry imaging with calculation by a validated proprietary software package.Significant group main effects for TG and VLDL-P were present; post-hoc tests revealed that serum TG concentrations were significantly higher in ↓T5 group compared to AB and ↑T4 groups [150±9 vs. 101±8 (p<0.01) and 112±8 mg/dl (p<0.05), respectively]. VLDL-P concentration was significantly elevated in ↓T5 group compared to AB and ↑T4 groups [74±4 vs. 58±4 (p<0.05) and 55±4 μmol/l (p<0.05)]. VAT volume was significantly higher in both SCI groups than in the AB group, and HOMA-IR was higher and approached significance in the SCI groups compared to the AB group. A linear relationship between triglyceride rich lipoproteins (i.e., TG or Large VLDL-P) and VAT volume or HOMA-IR was significant only in the ↓T5 group.Despite a similar VAT volume and insulin resistance in both SCI groups, the ↓T5 group had significantly higher serum TG and VLDL-P values than that observed in the ↑T4 and the AB control groups. Thus, level of injury is an important determinate of the concentration of circulating triglyceride rich lipoproteins, which may play a role in the genesis of cardiometabolic dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2601008472,"Enveloped viruses infect host cells by fusing their membranes with those of the host cell, a process mediated by viral glycoproteins upon binding to cognate host receptors or entering into acidic intracellular compartments. Whereas the effect of receptor density on viral infection has been well studied, the role of cell type-specific factors/processes, such as pH regulation, has not been characterized in sufficient detail. Here, we examined the effects of cell-extrinsic factors (buffer environment) and cell-intrinsic factors (interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins, IFITMs), on the pH regulation in early endosomes and on the efficiency of acid-dependent fusion of the avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV), with endosomes. First, we found that a modest elevation of external pH can raise the pH in early endosomes in a cell type-dependent manner and thereby delay the acid-induced fusion of endocytosed ASLV. Second, we observed a cell type-dependent delay between the low pH-dependent and temperature-dependent steps of viral fusion, consistent with the delayed enlargement of the fusion pore. Third, ectopic expression of IFITMs, known to potently block influenza virus fusion with late compartments, was found to only partially inhibit ASLV fusion with early endosomes. Interestingly, IFITM expression promoted virus uptake and the acidification of endosomal compartments, resulting in an accelerated fusion rate when driven by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, but not by the transmembrane isoform of the ASLV receptor. Collectively, these results highlight the role of cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic factors in regulating the efficiency and kinetics of virus entry and fusion with target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2598976035,"Lipid peroxidation is an endogenous source of aldehydes that gives rise to covalent modification of proteins in various pathophysiological states. In this study, a strategy for the comprehensive detection and comparison of adducts was applied to find a biomarker for lipid peroxidation-modified proteins in vivo This adductome approach utilized liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) methods designed to detect the specific product ions from positively ionized adducts in a selected reaction monitoring mode. Using this procedure, we comprehensively analyzed lysine and histidine adducts generated in the in vitro oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and observed a prominent increase in several adducts, including a major lysine adduct. Based on the high resolution ESI-MS of the adduct and on the LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of the synthetic adduct candidates, the major lysine adduct detected in the oxidized LDL was identified as Nϵ-(8-carboxyoctanyl)lysine (COL). Strikingly, a significantly higher amount of COL was detected in the sera from atherosclerosis-prone mice and from patients with hyperlipidemia compared with the controls. These data not only offer structural insights into protein modification by lipid peroxidation products but also provide a platform for the discovery of biomarkers for human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2603186043,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently still a major factor leading to death, lacking of reliable biomarkers. Therefore, deep understanding the pathogenesis for HCC is of great importance. The emergence of circular RNA (circRNA) provides a new way to study the pathogenesis of human disease. Here, we employed the prediction tool to identify circRNAs based on RNA-seq data. Then, to investigate the biological function of the circRNA, the candidate circRNAs were associated with the protein-coding genes (PCGs) by GREAT. We found significant candidate circRNAs expression alterations between normal and tumor samples. Additionally, the PCGs associated with these candidate circRNAs were also found have discriminative expression patterns between normal and tumor samples. The enrichment analysis illustrated that these PCGs were predominantly enriched for liver/cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, myocardial ischemia and coronary heart disease, and participated in various metabolic processes. Together, a further network analysis indicated that these PCGs play important roles in the regulatory and the PPI network. Finally, we built a classification model to distinguish normal and tumor samples by using candidate circRNAs and their associated genes, respectively. Both of them obtained satisfactory results (~ 0.99 of AUC for circRNA and PCG). Our findings suggested that the circRNA could be a critical factor in HCC, providing a useful resource to explore the pathogenesis of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2600794599,"Background Low back pain (LBP) is common in the population and multifactorial in nature, often involving negative consequences. Reassuring information to improve coping is recommended for reducing the negative consequences of LBP. Adding a simple non-threatening explanation for the pain (temporary muscular dysfunction) has been successful at altering beliefs and behavior when delivered with other intervention elements. This study investigates the isolated effect of this specific information on future occupational behavior outcomes when delivered to the workforce. Design A cluster-randomized controlled trial. Methods Publically employed workers (n = 505) from 11 Danish municipality centers were randomized at center-level (cluster) to either intervention (two 1-hour group-based talks at the workplace) or control. The talks provided reassuring information together with a simple non-threatening explanation for LBP—the ‘functional-disturbance’-model. Data collections took place monthly over a 1-year period using text message tracking (SMS). Primary outcomes were self-reported days of cutting down usual activities and work participation. Secondary outcomes were self-reported back beliefs, work ability, number of healthcare visits, bothersomeness, restricted activity, use of pain medication, and sadness/depression. Results There was no between-group difference in the development of LBP during follow-up. Cumulative logistic regression analyses showed no between-group difference on days of cutting down activities, but increased odds for more days of work participation in the intervention group (OR = 1.83 95% CI: 1.08–3.12). Furthermore, the intervention group was more likely to report: higher work ability, reduced visits to healthcare professionals, lower bothersomeness, lower levels of sadness/depression, and positive back beliefs. Conclusion Reassuring information involving a simple non-threatening explanation for LBP significantly increased the odds for days of work participation and higher work ability among workers who went on to experience LBP during the 12-month follow-up. Our results confirm the potential for public-health education for LBP, and add to the discussion of simple versus multidisciplinary interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2597475574,"Phospholipase C-related, but catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) was previously identified as a novel inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-binding protein with a domain organization similar to that of phospholipase C-δ but lacking phospholipase activity. We recently showed that PRIP gene knock-out (KO) in mice increases bone formation and concomitantly decreases bone resorption, resulting in increased bone mineral density and trabecular bone volume. However, the role of PRIP in osteoclastogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of PRIP on bone remodeling by investigating dynamic tooth movement in mice fitted with orthodontic devices. Morphological analysis indicated that the extent of tooth movement was smaller in the PRIP-KO mice than in wild-type mice. Histological analysis revealed fewer osteoclasts on the bone-resorption side in maxillary bones of PRIP-KO mice, and osteoclast formation assays and flow cytometry indicated lower osteoclast differentiation in bone marrow cells isolated from these mice. The expression of genes implicated in bone resorption was lower in differentiated PRIP-KO cells, and genes involved in osteoclast differentiation, such as the transcription factor NFATc1, exhibited lower expression in immature PRIP-KO cells initiated by M-CSF. Moreover, calcineurin expression and activity were also lower in the PRIP-KO cells. The PRIP-KO cells also displayed fewer M-CSF-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ and exhibited reduced nuclear localization of NFATc1. Up-regulation of intracellular Ca2+ restored osteoclastogenesis of the PRIP-KO cells.

https://openalex.org/W2603221461,"Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. It was first identified in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome as a tumor suppressor gene. Whether endothelial LKB1 regulates angiogenesis and tumor growth is unknown. In this study, we generated endothelial cell-specific LKB1-knockout (LKB1endo−/−) mice by crossbreeding vascular endothelial-cadherin-Cre mice with LKB1flox/flox mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was highly co-stained in endothelial cells but not in macrophages in LKB1endo−/− mice. Consistently, LKB1endo−/− mouse tissues including the lung, skin, kidney and liver showed increased vascular permeability. Tumors implanted in LKB1endo−/− mice but not macrophage-specific LKB1-knockout mice grew faster and showed enhanced vascular permeability and increased angiogenesis as compared with those implanted in wild-type mice. Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibody but not the isotype-matched control antibody decreased endothelial-cell angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, LKB1 deletion enhanced mouse retinal and cell angiogenesis, and knockdown of VEGF by small-interfering RNA decreased endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Re-expression of LKB1 or knockdown of VEGF receptor 2 decreased the overproliferation and -migration observed in LKB1endo−/− cells. Mechanistically, LKB1 could bind to the VEGF transcription factor, specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which then inhibited the binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter to reduce VEGF expression. Endothelial LKB1 may regulate endothelial angiogenesis and tumor growth by modulating Sp1-mediated VEGF expression."
https://openalex.org/W2601812677,"Genome-wide association studies have identified over one hundred common genetic risk variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, most of the heritability of T2D has not been accounted for. In this study, we investigated the contribution of rare and common variants to T2D susceptibility by analyzing exome array data in 1,908 Han Chinese genotyped with Affymetrix Axiom® Exome Genotyping Arrays. Based on the joint common and rare variants analysis of 57,704 autosomal SNPs within 12,244 genes using Sequence Kernel Association Tests (SKAT), we identified significant associations between T2D and 25 variants (9 rare and 16 common) in MUC5B, p-value 1.01×10-14. This finding was replicated (p = 0.0463) in an independent sample that included 10,401 unrelated individuals. Sixty-six of 1,553 possible haplotypes based on 25 SNPs within MUC5B showed significant association with T2D (Bonferroni corrected p values < 3.2×10-5). The expression level of MUC5B is significantly higher in pancreatic tissues of persons with T2D compared to those without T2D (p-value = 5×10-5). Our findings suggest that dysregulated MUC5B expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of T2D. As a strong candidate gene for T2D, MUC5B may play an important role in the mechanisms underlying T2D etiology and its complications."
https://openalex.org/W2597788922,"The Mig10/RIAM/Lpd (MRL) adapter protein Lpd regulates actin dynamics through interactions with Scar/WAVE and Ena/VASP proteins to promote the formation of cellular protrusions and to stimulate invasive migration. However, the ability of MRL proteins to interact with multiple actin regulators and to promote serum response factor (SRF) signalling has raised the question of whether MRL proteins employ alternative downstream mechanisms to drive oncogenic processes in a context-dependent manner. Here, using a Drosophila model, we show that overexpression of either human Lpd or its Drosophila orthologue Pico can promote growth and invasion of RasV12-induced cell tumours in the brain. Notably, effects were restricted to two populations of Repo-positive glial cells: an invasive population, characterized by JNK-dependent elevation of Mmp1 expression, and a hyperproliferative population lacking elevated JNK signalling. JNK activation was not triggered by reactive immune cell signalling, implicating the involvement of an intrinsic stress response. The ability to promote dissemination of RasV12-induced tumours was shared by a subset of actin regulators, including, most prominently, Chicadee/Profilin, which directly interacts with Pico, and, Mal, a cofactor for serum response factor that responds to changes in G:F actin dynamics. Suppression of Mal activity partially abrogated the ability of pico to promote invasion of RasV12 tumours. Furthermore, we found that larval glia are enriched for serum response factor expression, explaining the apparent sensitivity of glial cells to Pico/RasV12 overexpression. Taken together, our findings indicate that MRL proteins cooperate with oncogenic Ras to promote formation of glial tumours, and that, in this context, Mal/serum response factor activation is rate-limiting for tumour dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2602404290,"Prophages are major contributors to horizontal gene transfer and drive the evolution and diversification of bacteria. Here, we describe the characterization of a prophage element designated pp3 in the clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate PA1. pp3 spontaneously excises from the PA1 genome and circularizes at a very high frequency of 25%. pp3 is likely to be a defective prophage due to its inability to form plaques on P. aeruginosa indicator strains, and no phage particles could be detected in PA1 supernatants. The pp3-encoded integrase is essential for excision by mediating site-specific recombination at the 26-bp attachment sequence. Using a filter mating experiment, we demonstrated that pp3 can transfer into P. aeruginosa recipient strains that do not possess this element naturally. Upon transfer, pp3 integrates into the same attachment site as in PA1 and maintains the ability to excise and circularize. Furthermore, pp3 significantly promotes biofilm formation in the recipient. Sequence alignment reveals that the 26-bp attachment site recognized by pp3 is conserved in all P. aeruginosa strains sequenced to date, making it possible that pp3 could be extensively disseminated in P. aeruginosa. This work improves our understanding of the ways in which prophages influence bacterial behavior and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2604058415,"Background With the increasing frequency of tunneled hemodialysis catheter use there is a parallel increase in the need for removal and/or exchange. A small but significant minority of catheters become embedded or ‘stuck’ and cannot be removed by traditional means. Management of embedded catheters involves cutting the catheter, burying the retained fragment with a subsequent increased risk of infections and thrombosis. Endoluminal dilatation may provide a potential safe and effective technique for removing embedded catheters, however, to date, there is a paucity of data. Objectives 1) To determine factors associated with catheters becoming embedded and 2) to determine outcomes associated with endoluminal dilatation Methods All patients with endoluminal dilatation for embedded catheters at our institution since Jan. 2010 were included. Patients who had an embedded catheter were matched 1:3 with patients with uncomplicated catheter removal. Baseline patient and catheter characteristics were compared. Outcomes included procedural success and procedure-related infection. Logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with embedded catheters. Results We matched 15 cases of embedded tunneled catheters with 45 controls. Among patients with embedded catheters, there were no complications with endoluminal dilatation. Factors independently associated with embedded catheters included catheter dwell time (> 2 years) and history of central venous stenosis. Conclusion Embedded catheters can be successfully managed by endoluminal dilatation with minimal complications and factors associated with embedding include dwell times > 2 years and/or with a history of central venous stenosis."
https://openalex.org/W2598955517,"The study aim was to investigate the effect of endogenous insulin release on lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue after adrenergic stimulation in obese subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In 14 obese female T2D subjects, or 14 obese non-T2D controls, glycerol concentration was measured in response to the α1,2,ß-agonist norepinephrine, the α1-agonist norfenefrine and the ß2-agonist terbutaline (each 10-4 M), using the microdialysis technique. After 60 minutes of stimulation, an intravenous glucose load (0.5 g/kg lean body mass) was given. Local blood flow was monitored by means of the ethanol technique. Norepinephrine and norfenefrine induced a four and three fold rise in glycerol dialysate concentration (p<0.001, each), with a similar pattern in adipose tissue. Following agonist stimulation and glucose infusion, endogenous insulin release inhibited lipolysis in the presence of norepinephrine, which was more rapid and pronounced in healthy obese controls than in T2D subjects (p = 0.024 obese vs T2D subjects). Insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis in the presence of norfenefrine was similar in all study participants. In the presence of terbutaline the lipolysis rate increased two fold until the effect of endogenous insulin (p<0.001). A similar insulin-induced decrease in lipolysis was observed for each of the norfenefrine groups and the terbutaline groups, respectively. Adipose tissue blood flow remained unchanged after the iv-glucose load. Both norepinephrine and norfenefrine diminished blood flow slightly, but insulin reversed this response (p<0.001 over the entire time). Terbutaline alone and terbutaline plus increased endogenous insulin augmented local blood flow (p<0.001 over the entire time). In conclusion, a difference in insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis was observed in obese T2D subjects compared to obese healthy controls following modulation of sympathetic nervous system activity and is assumed to be due to ß1-adrenoceptor mediated stimulation by norepinephrine."
