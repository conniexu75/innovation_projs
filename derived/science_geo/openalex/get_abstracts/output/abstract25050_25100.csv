https://openalex.org/W1529319601,"We have investigated the nature of immediate cell signals produced by occupancy of the chicken osteoclast alpha v beta 3 integrin. Synthetic osteopontin and peptides from the osteopontin and bone sialoprotein sequences containing Arg-Gly-Asp stimulated immediate reductions in osteoclast cytosolic Ca2+. The changes in cytosolic Ca2+ required the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence and were blocked by a monoclonal antibody to the alpha v beta 3 integrin, LM609. Osteoclast stimulation by the proteins through the integrin did not require immobilization since soluble peptides produced changes in cytosolic Ca2+ and inhibited osteoclast binding to bone particles and bone resorption. The decrease in cytosolic Ca2+ stimulated by osteopontin and related peptides appeared to be due to activation of a plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase by calmodulin. Thus, the data suggest that ligand binding to the osteoclast alpha v beta 3 integrin results in calmodulin-dependent reduction in cytosolic Ca2+ which participates in regulation of osteoclast function."
https://openalex.org/W1639438268,"Human factor VIII and factor VIIIa were proteolytically inactivated by activated protein C. Cleavages occurred within the heavy chain (contiguous A1-A2-B domains) of factor VIII and in the heavy chain-derived A1 and A2 subunits of factor VIIIa, whereas no proteolysis was observed in the light chain or light chain-derived A3-C1-C2 subunit. Reactivity to an anti-A2 domain monoclonal antibody and NH2-terminal sequence analysis of three terminal digest fragments from factor VIII allowed ordering of fragments and identification of cleavage sites. Fragment A1 was derived from the NH2 terminus and resulted from cleavage at Arg336-Met337. The A2 domain was bisected following cleavage at Arg562-Gly563 and yielded fragments designated A2N and A2C. A third cleavage site is proposed at the A2-B junction (Arg740-Ser741) since fragment A2C was of equivalent size when derived either from factor VIII or factor VIIIa. The site at Arg562 was preferentially cleaved first in factor VIII(alpha) compared with the site at Arg336, and it was this initial cleavage that most closely correlated with the loss of cofactor activity. Factor VIIIa was inactivated 5-fold faster than factor VIII, possibly as a result of increased protease utilization of the site at Arg562 when the A2 subunit is not contiguous with the A1 domain. When initial cleavage occurred at Arg336, it appeared to preclude subsequent cleavage at Arg562, possibly by promoting dissociation of the A2 domain (subunit) from the A1/light chain dimer. This conclusion was supported by the failure of protease treated A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer to bind A2 subunit and gel filtration analysis that showed dissociation of the A2 domain-derived fragments, A2N and A2C, from the A1 fragment/light chain dimer. These results suggest a mechanism for activated protein C-catalyzed inactivation of factor VIII(alpha) involving both covalent alteration and fragment dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1496939314,"Three, non-cytosolic Ca2+ pools were characterized in intact PC12 cells. The first pool, sensitive to both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and caffeine (Zacchetti, D., Clementi, E., Fasolato, C., Zottini, M., Grohovaz, F., Fumagalli, G., Pozzan, T., and Meldolesi, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20152-20158) accounts for approximately equal to 200 microM of Ca2+/liter of cell water (less than 30% of total exchangeable Ca2+) and takes up Ca2+ from the cytosol via a Ca(2+)-ATPase, blocked by thapsigargin. A second pool, approximately equal to 400 microM/liter, is insensitive to both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, caffeine, and thapsigargin and is released by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. This pool is probably heterogeneous and its intracellular localization and physiological roles remain undefined. The third pool, approximately equal to 170 mumoles of Ca2+/liter, was discharged by the combination of ionomycin together with a substance that collapsed intracellular pH gradients, such as monensin or NH4Cl. This indicates that the pool is acidic, at variance with the first two. When exocytosis was stimulated, the size of this pool declined, indicating its primary residence within secretory granules. In the conditions of our experiments no major transfer of Ca2+ among the pools seemed to occur. This is the first comprehensive description of non-cytosolic Ca2+ pools investigated in intact neurosecretory cells by non-invasive procedures."
https://openalex.org/W1599938904,"To examine the phosphorylation of casein kinase II in cells, the enzyme was isolated by immunoprecipitation from metabolically labeled human epidermal carcinoma A431 cells using polyclonal antipeptide antibodies specific for either the alpha subunit or the beta subunit of the enzyme. When isolated from 32P-labeled cells, the beta subunit was found to be significantly labeled on serine residues whereas only minimal labeling was associated with the alpha subunit. In vitro, the beta subunit of purified bovine casein kinase II was autophosphorylated, also on serine residues. Cleavage of the beta subunit, that had been autophosphorylated in vitro, at tryptophan 9 and tryptophan 12 using N-chlorosuccinimide demonstrated that the autophosphorylation site is located near the amino terminus of the protein, most likely at serine 2 and serine 3. Two-dimensional maps of phosphopeptides generated by digestion of the beta subunit with endoproteinase Glu-C indicted that the majority of the phosphate that was incorporated into the protein in cells was at sites that were indistinguishable from the sites that were autophosphorylated in vitro. In addition to phosphorylation at the autophosphorylation site, the beta subunit is also phosphorylated at an additional site, serine 209, in intact cells. This residue, which is near the carboxyl terminus of the protein, can be phosphorylated in vitro by p34cdc2."
https://openalex.org/W1631475273,"Chromatin high mobility group protein I (HMG-I) is a mammalian nonhistone protein that has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo to preferentially bind to A.T-rich sequences of DNA. Recently DNA-binding domain peptide that specifically mediates in vitro interaction of high mobility group protein (HMG)-I with narrow minor groove of A.T-DNA has been experimentally determined. Because of its predicted secondary structure, binding domain peptide has been called the A.T motif. Previously we demonstrated that A.T hook of murine HMG-I protein is specifically phosphorylated by purified mammalian cdc2 kinase in vitro and that same site(s) are also phosphorylated in vivo in metaphase-arrested cells. We also found that DNA binding affinity of short synthetic binding domain peptides phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2 kinase was significantly reduced compared with unphosphorylated peptides. Here we extend these findings to intact natural and recombinant HMG-I proteins. We report that affinity of binding of full-length HMG-I proteins to A.T-rich sequences is highly dependent on ionic conditions and that phosphorylation of intact proteins by cdc2 kinase reduces their affinity of in vitro binding to A.T-DNA by about 20-fold when assayed near normal mammalian physiological salt concentrations. Furthermore, in cell synchronization studies, we demonstrated that murine HMG-I proteins are phosphorylated in vivo in a cell cycle-dependent manner on same amino acid residues modified by purified cdc2 kinase in vitro. Together these results strongly support assertion that HMG-I proteins are natural substrates for mammalian cdc2 kinase in vivo and that their cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation by this enzyme(s) significantly modulates their DNA binding affinity, thereby possibly altering their biological function(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1539491437,"Photosystem I is one of the two multisubunit pigment-protein complexes in the thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria. Subunit III of photosystem I complex was isolated from a mutant of the cyanonbacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803, which lacks subunit II. The sequence of its NH2-terminal residues was determined and corresponding oligonucleotide probes were used to isolate the gene encoding this subunit. The gene, designated as psaF, codes for a mature protein of 15705 Da that is synthesized with a 23-amino acid extension. The deduced amino acid sequence is homologous to subunit III from spinach and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The presequence of subunit III shows characteristics typical of bacterial presequences and exhibits remarkable amino acid identity around the proteolytic processing site when compared to corresponding regions from the precursors of eukaryotic subunit III. There are two conserved hydrophobic regions in the mature subunit III which may cross or interact with thylakoid membrane. The gene psaF exists as a single copy in the genome and is expressed as a monocistronic RNA. A stable mutant strain in which the gene psaF was replaced by a gene conferring resistance to kanamycin was generated by targeted mutagenesis. Photoautotrophic growth of the mutant strain was comparable with that of the wild type suggesting that function of subunit III is dispensable for photosynthesis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Addition of more MgSO4 to BG11 medium enhanced growth of the mutant strain but not of the wild type cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555856681,"Differential scanning calorimetry was performed to monitor the heat-induced changes that occur in the structural domain of lens alpha-crystallin. Circular dichroism and fluorescence also were used to resolve the controversial issue of the quaternary structure of alpha-crystallin. Based on the thermal behavior as monitored by these techniques, a model is proposed that can account for all previous data as well as the currently reported thermal data. The proposed model of native alpha-crystallin has a three-layer structure in which the inner layer (core) is a micelle containing 12 subunits arranged in cuboctahedral symmetry. The apolar region is directed inward constituting a hydrophobic core similar to a micelle and adding structural stability. A second layer of six subunits has a similar but not identical structure to the first layer, directing its apolar face toward the hydrophobic core. Thus, these two layers constitute a micelle-like structure with octahedral symmetry. The third layer adds more subunits for a total of not more than 24. Differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism, and fluorescence studies indicated that the inner two-layer structure of molecular mass 360 kDa is highly stable and is most likely of the alpha m form. The three-layer structure of the native protein, however, is rather unstable. At 35-45 degrees C the outer layer dissociates from the inner two layers, and at higher temperatures rapidly reassociates to a slightly modified two-layer structure with a stability similar to that of alpha m. The proposed model does not require any specific assembly of the alpha A and alpha B subunits in each layer, but the fluorescence results suggest that the native inner two layers probably contain mostly alpha A."
https://openalex.org/W1510113494,"Abstract The origin of previously observed variations in stoichiometry of iron oxidation during the oxidative deposition of iron in ferritin has been poorly understood. Knowledge of the stoichiometry of Fe(II) oxidation by O2 is essential to establishing the mechanism of iron core formation. In the present work, the amount of Fe(II) oxidized was measured by Mossbauer spectrometry and the O2 consumed by mass spectrometry. The number of protons produced in the reaction was measured by pH stat titration and hydrogen peroxide production by the effect of the enzyme catalase on the measured stoichiometry. For protein samples containing low levels of iron (24 Fe(II)/protein) the stoichiometry was found to be 1.95 +/- 0.18 Fe(II)/O2 with H2O2 being a product, viz. Equation 1. 2Fe2+ + O2 + 4H2O----2FeOOH + H2O2 + 4H+ (1) EPR spin trapping experiments showed no evidence of superoxide radical formation. The stoichiometry markedly increased with additional iron (240-960 Fe/protein), to a value of 4 Fe(II)/O2 as in Equation 2. 4Fe2+ + O2 + 6H2O----4FeOOH + 8H+ (2) As the iron core is progressively laid down, the mechanism of iron oxidation changes from a protein dominated process with H2O2 being the primary product of O2 reduction to a mineral surface dominated process where H2O is the primary product. These results emphasize the importance of the apoferritin shell in facilitating iron oxidation in the early stage of iron deposition prior to significant development of the polynuclear iron core."
https://openalex.org/W1526061632,"Purified mitochondrial creatine kinase (Mi-CK) (EC 2.7.3.2) from chicken heart was shown to interact simultaneously with purified inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, thereby creating an intermembrane chondrial membranes, thereby creating an intermembrane were purified from rat liver and thus were fully devoid of Mi-CK. Intermembrane contact formation was demonstrated by measuring the binding of inner membrane vesicles to outer membranes spread at the air-water interface. Mi-CK also mediated intermembrane adhesion when membranes formed with total lipid extracts of both membranes were used, pointing to the role of lipids as potential membrane anchors of Mi-CK in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Other enzymes of the intermembrane space that (like Mi-CK) are also cationic, as well as cytosolic isoenzymes of creatine kinase, failed to induce contact formation. Thus, of the proteins tested, membrane contact formation was specific for Mi-CK. The two oligomeric forms of Mi-CK (octamer and dimer) differed in their ability to mediate intermembrane adhesion, the octamer being more potent. Highly basic peptides, i.e. poly-L-lysines, were shown to strongly interact with membranes formed with lipid extracts of mitochondrial membranes: they both induced intermembrane binding and fusion. Interestingly, the extent of contact formation mediated by poly-L-lysines was lower than that of octameric Mi-CK. The implications of these findings on the function and localization of Mi-CK and on the structure of the mitochondrial intermembrane compartment are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1592656678,"Heparin cofactor II (HCII) is a glycoprotein in human plasma that inhibits thrombin and chymotrypsin. Inhibition occurs when the protease attacks the reactive site peptide bond in HCII (Leu444-Ser445) and becomes trapped as a covalent 1:1 complex. Dermatan sulfate and heparin increase the rate of inhibition of thrombin, but not of chymotrypsin, greater than 1000-fold. The N-terminal portion of HCII contains two acidic repeats (Glu56-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Leu-Asp and Glu69-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Ile-Asp) that may bind to anion-binding exosite I of thrombin to facilitate covalent complex formation. To examine the importance of the acidic domain, we have constructed a series of 5' deletions in the HCII cDNA and expressed the recombinant HCII (rHCII) in Escherichia coli. Apparent second-order rate constants (k2) for inhibition of alpha-thrombin and chymotrypsin by each variant were determined. Deletion of amino acid residues 1-74 had no effect on the rate of inhibition of alpha-thrombin or chymotrypsin in the absence of a glycosaminoglycan. Similarly, the rate of inhibition of alpha-thrombin in the presence of a glycosaminoglycan was unaffected by deletion of residues 1-52. However, deletion of residues 1-67 (first acidic repeat) or 1-74 (first and second acidic repeats) greatly decreased the rate of inhibition of alpha-thrombin in the presence of heparin, dermatan sulfate, or a dermatan sulfate hexasaccharide that comprises the minimum high-affinity binding site for HCII. Deletion of one or both of the acidic repeats increased the apparent affinity of rHCII for heparin-Sepharose, suggesting that the acidic domain may interact with the glycosaminoglycan-binding site of native rHCII. The stimulatory effect of glycosaminoglycans on native rHCII was decreased by a C-terminal hirudin peptide which binds to anion-binding exosite I of alpha-thrombin. Furthermore, the ability of native rHCII to inhibit gamma-thrombin, which lacks the binding site for hirudin, was stimulated weakly by glycosaminoglycans. These results support a model in which the stimulatory effect of glycosaminoglycans on the inhibition of alpha-thrombin is mediated, in part, by the N-terminal acidic domain of HCII."
https://openalex.org/W1483586790,"cDNAs were isolated that encode mouse mast cell protease-5 (MMCP-5), an approximately 30,000 Mr serine protease stored in the secretory granules of serosal mast cells (SMC) and Kirsten sarcoma virus-immortalized mast cells. Based on the deduced amino acid sequences of these cDNAs, MMCP-5 is synthesized as a 247-amino acid preproenzyme composed of a novel 19-residue hydrophobic signal peptide, a Gly-Glu activation peptide not present in other mast cell chymases, and a 226-amino acid protein that represents the mature enzyme. MMCP-5 possesses a unique Asn residue in the substrate binding cleft at residue 176 and is highly basically charged. The MMCP-5 gene was isolated, sequenced, and found to belong to a distinct subset of chymase genes. Allelic variations of the MMCP-5 gene were also detected. MMCP-5 is expressed in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC), Kirsten sarcoma virus-immortalized mast cells, and SMC, but not in gastrointestinal mucosal mast cells of helminth-infected mice. The abundant levels of MMCP-5 mRNA in immature BMMC indicate that this chymase is expressed relatively early during the differentiation of mast cells. MMCP-5 is the first chymase to be molecularly cloned from progenitor mast cells and is also the first chymase shown to be expressed preferentially in the SMC subclass."
https://openalex.org/W1507424882,"The complete primary structures of the major Asn-linked oligosaccharides from the type II variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs), MITat 1.2 and MITat 1.7, and the type III VSG, MITat 1.5, were determined using a combination of exo- and endoglycosidase digestions, methylation analysis, acetolysis, and 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Each variant contained classical branched oligomannose-type and biantennary complex oligosaccharides, a proportion of the latter substituted with terminal alpha(1-3)-linked galactose residues, the first report of the presence of this epitope in Trypanosoma brucei. In addition both the type II variants contained relatively large amounts of the unusual small oligomannose-type oligosaccharides, Man4GlcNAc2 and Man3GlcNAc2, and a diverse array of novel branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides, similar but not identical to those from mammalian glycoproteins. These latter structures were also partially substituted with terminal alpha(1-3)-linked galactose residues. Glycosylation in the type II variants showed site specificity in that the poly-N-acetyllactosamine and Man(9-5)GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides were located exclusively at Asn-glycosylation site 1 very close to the C terminus, whereas the Man(4-3)GlcNAc2 and biantennary complex oligosaccharides were located exclusively at site 2. This is the first report of the presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides in protozoa."
https://openalex.org/W1506802130,"The normal provision of thyroid hormones to the body requires their release from the prohormone, thyroglobulin (Tg). Previous work established the importance of cathepsins B, D, and L (formerly designated cysteine proteinase I) to this process but had not defined the points of proteolytic attack for each enzyme. In the present study we labeled rabbit Tg in vivo with sodium 125I and performed limited digestions with cathepsins B, D, and L, purified from human thyroids. The resultant peptide fragments were analyzed by amino-terminal sequencing and located within the Tg molecule by comparison with the cDNA-derived sequences from human Tg. We identified three cleavage points for cathepsin B, corresponding to P'1 residues 532, 795, and 2487; four cleavage points for cathepsin L, corresponding to P'1 residues 2389, 2452, 2490, and 2657; and four cleavage points for cathepsin D, corresponding to P'1 residues 551, 1835, 2468, and 2643. None of the cleavage points was near Tgs known hormonogenic sites, but these peptide fragments contained three of the four major hormonogenic sites in rabbit Tg, suggesting some preference for their early proteolytic processing. Cathespin B alone among the three endopeptidases had some exopeptidase activity toward Tg. The cleavage specificities for each of the endopeptidases resembled those described with other protein substrates. Thus, cathepsin D preferentially cleaved bonds between hydrophobic residues, and cathespin L cleaved bonds with hydrophobic residues at P2 and P3. Although cathepsin Bs specificity was less obvious, it produced a major cleavage between 2 leucine residues. The existence of three endopeptidases cleaving at different sites shows that Tg proteolysis is a complex process, suggests synergism among their enzyme activities, and provides a physiological mechanism for selective hormone release, including its regulation by TSH."
https://openalex.org/W1551693981,"C1q binds to and elicits cellular responses by several cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, B cells, and fibroblasts. The cell-binding domain is located within the collagen-like pepsin-resistant region of the C1q molecule (C1q tails). An affinity matrix of C1q tails coupled to Sepharose was used to select C1q-binding proteins from detergent extracts of surface-iodinated human monocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and the U937 cells. The major radiolabeled polypeptide eluted specifically from the ligand affinity column had an apparent molecular mass (Mr) of 126,000. Minor iodinated components eluted from Sepharose-tails migrated with Mr of 216,000 and 55,000. When subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions no change in the migration of any of these polypeptide bands was detected. None of these polypeptides reacted with antibodies directed against the integrins alpha 5 beta 1 (fibronectin receptor) or alpha v beta 3 (vitronectin receptor), LFA-1, or to several other cell adhesion molecules. The Mr 126,000 band was found to contain more than one polypeptide. Lectin binding properties, susceptibility to glycosidases and proteases, and immunoreactivity with the monoclonal antibody L-10, indicated that CD43 (sialophorin/leukosialin) is a component of this band. However, further data show that a monoclonal antibody, generated by immunization with the isolated Clq-binding fractions, recognizes a cell surface sialoglycoprotein distinct from CD43 and inhibits the C1q-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis in monocytes. These latter observations provide the first definitive connection between a specific phagocytic cell surface protein and a known C1q-mediated function. While these proteins contain sialic acid, binding assays and functional assays using neuraminidase-treated cells demonstrate that the functional interaction between C1q and the cell surface is not via sialic acid. The data taken together indicate either that the functional C1q receptor on phagocytic cells is a multi-subunit complex or that multiple proteins can interact with the fragment of C1q containing the cell-binding domain, at least one of which is involved in the C1q-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1589576710,"Mutations in selC, which reduce the 8-base pair aminoacyl-acceptor helix to the canonical 7-base pair length (tRNA(Sec)(delAc] or which replace the extra arm of tRNA(Sec) by that of a serine acceptor tRNA species (tRNA(Sec)(ExS), block the function in selenoprotein synthesis in vivo (Baron, C., Heider, J., and Bock, A. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 6761-6766). tRNA(Sec), tRNA(Sec)(delAc), and tRNA(Sec)(ExS) were purified and analyzed for their interaction with purified seryl-tRNA synthetase, selenocysteine synthase and translation factors SELB and EF-Tu. It was found that seryl-tRNA synthetase displays 10-fold impaired Km and Kcat values for tRNA(Sec) in comparison to tRNA(Ser), decreasing the overall charging efficiency (Kcat/Km) of tRNA(Sec) to 1% of that characteristic for tRNA(Ser). tRNA(Sec)(ExS) was a less efficient substrate for the enzyme (Kcat/Km 0.2% of the tRNA(Ser) value) whereas the tRNA(Ser)(delAc) variant was charged with an approximately 2-3-fold improved rate compared to wild-type tRNA(Sec). Both mutant tRNA variants, when charged with L-serine, were able to interact with selenocysteine synthase to give rise to selenocysteyl-tRNA with tRNA(Sec)(ExS) being as efficient as wild-type tRNA(Sec). Seryl-tRNA(Sec)(delAc), on the other hand, was selenylated very slowly. Reduction of the length of the aminoacyl-acceptor stem to 7 base pairs prevented the interaction with translation factor SELB but allowed binding to EF-Tu, irrespective of whether tRNA(Sec)(delAc) was charged with serine or selenocysteine. The aminoacyl-acceptor helix of tRNA(Sec), therefore, is a major determinant directing binding to SELB and precluding interaction with EF-Tu."
https://openalex.org/W1603396309,"The principal aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of variation in proton gradient and membrane potential on the transport of glycyl-L-glutamine (Gly-Gln) by renal brush border membrane vesicles. Under our conditions of transport assay, Gly-Gln was taken up by brush border membrane vesicles almost entirely as intact dipeptide. This uptake was mediated by two transporters shared by other dipeptides and characterized as the high affinity (Kt = 44.1 +/- 11.2 microM)/low capacity (Vmax = 0.41 +/- 0.03 nmol/mg protein/5 s) and low affinity (Kt = 2.62 +/- 0.50 mM)/high capacity (Vmax 4.04 +/- 0.80 nmol/mg protein/5 s) transporters. In the absence of a pH gradient, only the low affinity system was operational, but with a reduced transport capacity. Imposing a pH gradient of 1.6 pH units increased the Vmax of both transporters. Kinetic analysis of the rates of Gly-Gln uptake as a function of external pH revealed Hill coefficients of close or equal to 1, indicating that transporters contain only one binding site for the interaction with external H+. The effects of membrane potential on Gly-Gln uptake were investigated with valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potentials. The velocity of the high affinity system but not of the low affinity system increased linearly with increasing inside-negative K+ diffusion potentials (p less than 0.01). The Kt of neither system was affected by alterations in either pH gradient or membrane potential. We conclude that (a) the high affinity transporter is far more sensitive to changes in proton gradient and membrane potential than the low affinity transporter and (b) in the presence of a pH gradient, transport of each dipeptide molecule requires cotransport of one hydrogen ion to serve as the driving force."
https://openalex.org/W1542354017,"Linker insertion mutagenesis was employed to create structural disruptions of the lethal factor (LF) protein of anthrax toxin to map functional domains. A dodecameric linker was inserted at 17 blunt end restriction enzyme sites throughout the gene. Paired MluI restriction sites within the linker allowed the inserts to be reduced from four to two amino acids. Shuttle vectors containing the mutated genes were transformed into the avirulent Bacillus anthracis UM23C1-1 for expression and secretion of the gene products. Mutations at five sites in the central one-third of the sequence made the protein unstable, and purified protein could not be obtained. Mutated LF proteins with insertions at the other sites were purified and assessed for toxic activity in a macrophage lysis assay and for their ability to bind to the protective antigen (PA) component of anthrax toxin, the receptor binding moiety. Most insertions located in the NH2-terminal one-third of the LF protein eliminated both toxicity and binding to PA, while all four insertions in the COOH-terminal one-third of the protein eliminated toxicity without affecting binding to PA. These data support the hypothesis that the NH2-terminal domain contains the structures required for binding to PA and the COOH-terminal domain contains the putative catalytic domain of LF."
https://openalex.org/W1693455536,"To investigate the potential role of the COOH-terminal peptides in retaining a family of soluble carboxylesterases in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the pI 6.1 esterase cDNA has been cloned into the pKCR3 vector for transient expression in COS cells. The plasmid-encoded product appeared to be identical to the authentic enzyme: it was active on alpha-naphthyl acetate and behaved as a homotrimer of noncovalently bound 60-kDa subunits which contain a single, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive oligosaccharide chain. This enzyme was retained in the transgenic COS cells. In contrast, a mutated form ending in HVER-COOH was secreted, indicating that the natural terminus HVEL-COOH contains topogenic information, with the ultimate Leu residue as an essential part. Variants of pI 6.1 esterase ending in HIEL-COOH, or HTEL-COOH were retained in cells to the same extent as the wild-type protein. Therefore, the sequences HIEL and HTEL present at the COOH termini of several liver esterases (rabbit forms 1 and 2, human esterase, mouse egasyn, and rat pI 6.4 esterase) most likely have a function in their localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Finally, an HDEL-COOH variant of pI 6.1 esterase was also normally retained, demonstrating that this signal can be correctly decoded by the sorting machinery of mammalian cells. Cell retention signals of the type HXEL-COOH appear to be common in higher eukaryotes and tolerate considerable variation at the antepenultimate X residue."
https://openalex.org/W1557657530,"Previous studies had indicated that the form II or B cluster of CO2 fixation structural genes is part of a large operon in Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Gibson, J. L., Chen, J.-H., Tower, P. A., and Tabita, F. R. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8085-8093). In this investigation, we have sequenced the DNA between the prkB and rbpL genes and provide evidence for three distinct open reading frames which encode additional structural genes of the Calvin reductive pentose phosphate pathway; these genes encode the enzymes transketolase, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, and aldolase. Noteworthy is transketolase, which may be expressed to high levels in Escherichia coli. This study thus represents the initial description of the primary structure of bacterial transketolase, a key enzyme of the reductive and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathways. Each of the genes are separated by short stretches of intergenic sequence, consistent with earlier evidence which suggested that these genes are cotranscribed and part of a large operon controlled by sequences upstream from fbpB."
https://openalex.org/W1903998371,"The of binding of four active-site directed inhibitors to human thrombin has been determined by x-ray crystallographic analysis. The inhibitors studied are benzamidine, PPACK, NAPAP, and MD-805, of which the last three are compounds evolved specifically to inhibit thrombin. Crystal structures were determined in the presence of both the and the undecapeptide [des-amino Asp55]hirudin(55-65) which binds distant from the active site. Despite having significantly different chemical structures, NAPAP and MD-805 bind to thrombin in a very similar inhibitor binding mode which is not that expected by direct analogy with the binding of substrate. Both inhibitors bind to thrombin in a similar way as to trypsin, but thrombin has an extra the Tyr-Pro-Pro-Trp loop, not present in trypsin, which gives further binding interactions and is seen to move somewhat to accommodate binding of the different inhibitors. The fact that NAPAP and MD-805 require different stereochemistry for potent inhibition is demonstrated, and its structural basis clarified. The wealth of data on analogs and variants of these lead compounds is shown to be compatible with this binding mode."
https://openalex.org/W1579245019,"In this study we tested the hypothesis that functional erythrocyte-type glucose transporters (GLUT1) exist as oligomeric complexes by expressing chimeric transporter proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells harboring endogenous GLUT1 transporters. The chimeric transporters were GLUT1-4c, in which the 29 C-terminal residues of human GLUT1 were replaced by the 30 C-terminal residues of rat skeletal muscle glucose transporter (GLUT4), and GLUT1n-4, containing the N-terminal 199 residues of GLUT1 and the 294 C-terminal residues of GLUT4. Endogenous GLUT1 was quantitatively co-immunoprecipitated by using an anti-GLUT4 C-terminal peptide antibody from detergent extracts of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing either of the chimeric proteins, as detected by immunoblotting the precipitates with an anti-GLUT1 C-terminal peptide antiserum. No co-immunoprecipitation of native GLUT1 with native GLUT4 from extracts of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which contain both these transporters, was observed with the same antibody. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that GLUT1 transporters exist as homodimers or higher order oligomers and that a major determinant of oligomerization is located within the first 199 residues of GLUT1."

The protein has a marked tendency to form aggregates in denaturing solutions of high ionic strength, e.g. 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The purified protein contains a single, Mr 36,000 polypeptide chain, with a particularly high content of leucine. It contains about 1% carbohydrate with a remarkable absence of hexosamines and sialic acid, whereas xylose, galactose, mannose, and fucose were identified in the preparation. The protein was identified in extracts of cartilage and bone and could be shown to be primarily extracellular. Tendon may contain trace amounts of the protein, whereas extracts of several other tissues showed no immunoreactivity in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."
https://openalex.org/W1540539263,"To further evaluate the bioenergetic role of phosphocreatine, we assessed several parameters in normal and depleted rat hearts. Rats were fed (8 weeks) a diet containing either 1% beta-guanidinoproprionic acid or 2% beta-guanidinobutyric acid (beta-GBA), resulting in an 80% phosphocreatine depletion compared to controls. Left ventricular pressure-volume curves were obtained to determine contractile function. At any volume, the developed pressure in depleted hearts was lower than in controls. At the plateau, the rate-pressure product was between 37-45% lower: 34,000 (beta-GBA), 30,174 (beta-guanidinoproprionic acid) versus 54,400 (control). 31P NMR spectroscopy on beta-GBA-treated hearts obtained the [ATP] and [phosphocreatine], which with saturation transfer estimated the rates of creatine kinase and ATP production. In depleted hearts, the rate constant for ATP synthesis from phosphocreatine was increased 33%. However, the flux was 72% lower. ATP production from ADP and Pi were similar under normal conditions, in spite of higher rates of oxygen consumption in the depleted hearts. The addition of 50 mM creatine to control perfusate had no effect on function or high energy phosphates. In contrast, a 28% increase in function and a 52% increase in [phosphocreatine] was seen in beta-GBA hearts. There was a marked increase in free [ADP] in beta-GBA hearts, resulting in a lower estimated ATP phosphorylation potential. Overall, the results suggest that phosphocreatine may play an important function by optimizing the thermodynamics of cardiac high energy phosphate utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1575476982,"The mechanism by which endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins are induced by the accumulation of incompletely assembled or malfolded proteins in the ER is poorly understood. The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (BiP), one of the ER stress proteins, has often been detected in stable complexes with these accumulated proteins. We have transfected COS cells with an immunoglobulin (Ig) mu heavy chain expression plasmid. Expressed mu-chain accumulated in the cells and formed stable complexes with BiP. As a result, the synthesis of three ER stress proteins, BiP, the 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP94/ERp99), and ERp72, was increased as were their mRNA levels. In addition, the degradation rate of BiP was increased, possibly because of its interaction with mu-chain. Cotransfection of the mu-chain plasmid with an Ig lambda light chain expression plasmid resulted in the appearance of mu-chain in the media in a covalent complex with lambda-chain. An intracellular consequence of this was a reduction in the levels of BiP.mu-chain complex, and a diminished stimulation in the synthesis of the ER stress proteins. These results suggest that the BiP.mu-chain complex in the ER may be involved in the signaling pathway for the induction of ER stress proteins and may represent one regulatory mechanism operating in differentiating B-lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1579936648,"Rhodopsin, the photosensitive protein found in rod photoreceptors, has two covalently attached palmitates that are thought to anchor a portion of the C terminus to the disc membrane, forming a fourth cytoplasmic loop. Using hydroxylamine (NH2OH) to cleave the thioester linkage, we have characterized the effect of depalmitylation on certain functional properties of rhodopsin. Treatment of rod outer segment membranes (prepared from rat retinas previously labeled in vivo with [3H]palmitate) with 1 M NH2OH typically removed greater than or equal to 75% of the [3H]palmitate initially bound to rhodopsin. Spectrophotometry of rod outer segment membranes that had been treated with 1 M NH2OH indicated preservation of 85% of the native rhodopsin and no effect on the shape of the absorbance spectrum of rhodopsin. In vivo labeled rhodopsin that had been treated with 1 M NH2OH did not reincorporate free endogenous [3H] palmitate over a 2-h incubation period. Both NH2OH-treated and untreated rhodopsin incorporated [14C]palmitate from exogenously added [14C]palmitoyl-CoA. This incorporation was substantially greater in the NH2OH-treated sample. The removal of palmitate by NH2OH inhibited rhodopsin regeneration by 44% and increased the ability of rhodopsin to activate transducin's light-dependent GTPase activity by 61%. However, the removal of palmitate from rhodopsin did not affect the light-dependent binding of transducin (T alpha and T beta gamma)."
https://openalex.org/W1578695642,"A monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of diphtheria toxin to Vero cells was isolated by immunizing mice with Vero cell membrane. The antibody inhibits the binding of diphtheria toxin and also CRM197, a mutant form of diphtheria toxin, to Vero cells, and consequently inhibits the cytotoxicity of diphtheria toxin. This antibody does not directly react with the receptor molecule of diphtheria toxin (DTR14.5). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies revealed that this antibody binds to a novel membrane protein of 27 kDa (DRAP27). When diphtheria toxin receptor was passed through an affinity column made with this antibody, the receptor was trapped only in the presence of DRAP27. These results indicate that DRAP27 and DTR14.5 closely associate in Vero cell membrane and that the inhibition of the binding of diphtheria toxin to the receptor is due to the binding of the antibody to the DRAP27 molecule. Binding studies using 125I-labeled antibody showed that there are many more molecules of DRAP27 on the cell surface than diphtheria toxin-binding sites. However, there is a correlation between the sensitivity of a cell line to diphtheria toxin and the number of DRAP27 molecules on the cell surface, suggesting that DRAP27 is involved in the entry of diphtheria toxin into the target cell."
https://openalex.org/W1549394339,"The chemical modification of pig liver 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase by the antiepileptic drug 4-aminohex-5-enoate (Vigabatrin) has been studied. After inactivation by 14C-labeled Vigabatrin, the enzyme was digested with trypsin, and automated Edman degradation of the purified labeled peptide gave the sequence FWAHEHWGLDDPADVMTFSKK. Chymotryptic digestion of the tryptic peptide and sequencing of a resulting tripeptide identified the penultimate lysine residue of this peptide as the site of covalent modification. This lysine normally binds the coenzyme. Absorption spectroscopy demonstrated the absence of coenzyme from the tryptic peptide, and mass spectrometry showed its mass/charge ratio to be increased by 128. All of the bound coenzyme released after denaturation of the inactivated enzyme was as pyridoxamine phosphate. The structural nature of the modification is deduced, and mechanisms for its occurrence identified. Initially, 1 mol of radiolabeled inhibitor was bound per mol of monomer of the enzyme, although approximately half was released during denaturation and digestion, while the remainder was irreversibly bound. Coenzyme not released as pyridoxamine phosphate retained the absorbance characteristics of the aldimine, although the enzyme was completely inactive. Mass spectrometry of the sample of purified radiolabeled tryptic peptide revealed the presence of an approximately equal amount of a second fragment that contained no modification and from which the second lysine was absent, indicating that at the time of proteolysis the active site lysine was unaltered in 50% of the enzyme molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1594213151,"Abstract The yeast transcriptional regulator protein GCN4 harbors the bZIP DNA binding motif, which is common to a family of DNA-binding proteins in eukaryotic organisms from yeast to man. GCN4 and the mammalian activator protein AP-1 (jun/fos) regulate transcription by binding the same consensus DNA sequence ATGA (C/G)TCAT. GCN4 positively regulates the production of precursors of protein synthesis in yeast cells in response to the environmental signal amino acid starvation. We find three GCN4 responsive elements (GCREs) in the 5'-flanking region of the purine biosynthetic gene ADE4 and demonstrate that GCN4 efficiently activates transcription of ADE4. Two GCREs are essential to synergistically activate ADE4 transcription by binding GCN4. The distal GCRE1 is also required for basal transcription of ADE4. Therefore, transcription factor GCN4 affects, in addition to protein biosynthesis, also nucleotide biosynthesis and, comparable to its mammalian counterpart AP-1, has a more general function within the yeast cell than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W1517625197,"Abstract The model of with KCN plus iodoacetic acid mimics the ATP depletion and reductive stress of hypoxia. Here, we examined the effects of chemical hypoxia on cytosolic free Na+ and Ca2+ in single cultured rat hepatocytes by multiparameter digitized video microscopy and ratio imaging of sodium-binding furan indicator (SBFI) and Fura-2. Intracellular Na+ increased from about 10 mM to more than 100 mM after 20 min of chemical hypoxia, whereas cytosolic free Ca2+ remained virtually unchanged. In normoxic hepatocytes, phenylephrine (50 microM) and Arg-vasopressin (20-40 nM) induced Ca2+ oscillations in 70 and 40% of cells, respectively. These Ca2+ oscillations were suppressed after one spike following the onset of chemical hypoxia. Phenylephrine and vasopressin also increased inositol phosphate formation by 22 and 147%, respectively. This effect was suppressed by KCN plus iodoacetate. Intracellular acidosis is characteristic of chemical hypoxia. Intracellular acidosis induced by 40 mM Na-acetate suppressed Ca2+ oscillations but did not inhibit hormone-induced inositol phosphate formation. Cytosolic alkalinization also suppressed Ca2+ oscillations. However, prevention of intracellular acidosis with monensin (10 microM) did not prevent suppression of Ca2+ oscillations during chemical hypoxia. Mitochondrial depolarization with uncoupler did not change free Ca2+ levels during chemical hypoxia, indicating that mitochondria do not regulate free Ca2+ during chemical hypoxia. From these results, we conclude: 1) chemical hypoxia does not block Na+ influx across the plasma membrane; 2) Chemical hypoxia inhibits hormone-stimulated Ca2+ flux pathways across cellular membranes by two different mechanisms: (a) by ATP depletion, which disrupts hormone-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate coupling, and (b) by intracellular acidosis, which inhibits myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-stimulated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores; 3) during ATP depletion by chemical hypoxia, mitochondria do not take up Ca2+ to maintain cytosolic free Ca2+ at low concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1496564283,"12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulated the release of [3H]ethanolamine from HeLa cells prelabeled with [3H]ethanolamine within 2 min, and of [3H]choline from cells prelabeled with [3H]choline after a lag of 10-20 min. This result suggests that TPA activates phospholipase D. Propranolol alone or propranolol plus TPA stimulated phosphatidic acid (PA) labeling in cells prelabeled with [3H]hexadecanol. In the presence of ethanol, TPA stimulated the accumulation of labeled phosphatidylethanol (PEth); no PEth was formed in the absence of TPA. TPA-dependent PEth accumulation was not observed in cells pretreated with TPA to down-regulate protein kinase C, whereas propranolol-induced accumulation of PA was unaffected by TPA pretreatment. Incubation of prelabeled cells with propranolol alone caused a rapid loss of label and phospholipid mass from both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine (PC) together with an accumulation of PA and phosphatidylinositol plus phosphatidylserine. When [3H]hexadecanol-prelabeled cells were pulse labeled with 32P to label nucleotide pools, propranolol induced the accumulation of both 3H- and 32P-labeled PA. When cells were prelabeled with lyso-PC double labeled with 3H and 32P, and incubated with propranolol, only 3H-labeled PA accumulated, indicating that the pathways involved in the basal turnover of PC resulted in the loss of 32P from the lipid. These results suggest that the basal turnover of phosphatidylethanolamine and PC involves the sequential actions of phospholipase C, diglyceride kinase, and PA phosphohydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1503803593,"The amino acid sequence of the rat 40 S ribosomal subunit protein S2 was deduced from the sequence of nucleotides in two recombinant cDNAs and confirmed from the amino acid sequence of a cyanogen bromide peptide obtained from the protein. Ribosomal protein S2 has 293 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 31,211. Hybridization of the cDNA to digests of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 23-28 copies of the S2 gene. The mRNA for the protein is about 1,000 nucleotides in length. The highly conserved repetitive mammalian gene family designated LLRep3, but not identified before, encodes ribosomal protein S2. Rat S2 is related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae S4, Methanococcus vannielii S5, Escherichia coli S5, and other members of the prokaryotic S5 family. S. cerevisiae S4 and E. coli S5 are involved in the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes and in conditioning the fidelity of translation; it is plausible to assume that rat S2 serves similar functions. The NH2-terminal region of S2 is rich in arginine-glycine repeats including eight that occur in tandem and has two consecutive copies of the motif RGGF; these sequences have been associated with nucleolar localization and binding to RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1545377574,"Abstract The DNA polymerase holoenzyme of bacteriophage T4 contains, besides the DNA polymerase itself (the gene 43 protein), a complex of the protein products of T4 genes 44 and 62 (a DNA-dependent ATPase) and of gene 45. Together, the 44/62 and 45 proteins form an ATP-dependent sliding clamp that holds a moving DNA polymerase molecule at the 3' terminus of a growing DNA chain. We have used a unique DNA fragment that forms a short hairpin helix with a single-stranded 5' tail (a junction) to map the binding sites for these polymerase accessory proteins by DNA footprinting techniques. In the absence of the DNA polymerase, the accessory proteins protect from DNase I cleavage 19-20 nucleotides just behind the 3' end of the primer strand and 27-28 nucleotides on the complementary portion of the template strand. Detection of this DNA-protein complex requires the 44/62 and 45 proteins plus the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate). The complex is not detected in the presence of ATP. We suggest that ATP hydrolysis by the 44/62 protein normally activates the accessory proteins at a primer-template junction, permitting the DNA polymerase to bind and thus form the complete holoenzyme. However, when the polymerase is missing, as in these experiments, ATP hydrolysis is instead followed by a release (or loosening) of the accessory protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W1537032296,"We have used DNA footprinting techniques to analyze the interactions of five DNA replication proteins at a primer-template junction: the bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase (the gene 43 protein), its three accessory proteins (the gene 44/62 and 45 proteins), and the gene 32 protein, which is the T4 helix-destabilizing (or single-stranded DNA-binding) protein. The 177-nucleotide-long DNA substrate consisted of a perfect 52-base pair hairpin helix with a protruding single-stranded 5' tail. As expected, the DNA polymerase binds near the 3' end of this molecule (at the primer-template junction) and protects the adjacent double-stranded region from cleavage. When the gene 32 protein binds to the single-stranded tail, it reduces the concentration of the DNA polymerase required to observe the polymerase footprint by 10-30-fold. Periodic ATP hydrolysis by the 44/62 protein is required to maintain the activity of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme (a complex of the 43, 44/62, and 45 proteins). Footprinting experiments demonstrate the formation of a weak complex between the DNA polymerase and the gene 45 protein, but there is no effect of the 44/62 protein or ATP on this enlarged footprint. We propose a model for holoenzyme function in which the complex of the three accessory proteins uses ATP hydrolysis to keep a moving polymerase tightly bound to the growing 3' end, providing a clock to measure polymerase stalling."
https://openalex.org/W1561190910,"Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to investigate the role of Cys566 in the catalytic mechanism of rat liver NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase. Rat NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase and mutants containing either alanine or serine at position 566 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Substitution of alanine at position 566 had no effect on enzymatic activity with the acceptors cytochrome c and ferricyanide but did increase trans-hydrogenase activity with 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate by 79%. The Km for NADPH was increased 2.5-fold, and the NADP+ KI was increased 4.8-fold compared with that found for the wild-type enzyme. The conservative substitution, Ser566, produced a 50% decrease in cytochrome c reductase activity whereas activity with ferricyanide was decreased 57%, and 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate activity was unaffected. The NADPH Km was increased 4.6-fold, and the NADP+ KI increased 7.6-fold. The dependence of cytochrome c reductase activity on the KCl concentration was markedly altered by the Cys566 substitutions. Maximum activity for the wild-type enzyme was observed at approximately 0.18 M KCl whereas maximum activity for the mutant enzymes was observed between 0.04 and 0.09 M KCl. The pH dependence of cytochrome c reductase activity, cytochrome c Km, and flavin content were unaffected by these substitutions. These results demonstrate that Cys566 is not essential for activity of rat liver NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase although the cysteine side chain does affect the interaction of NADPH with the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1571091602,"Abstract The mechanism of dietary regulation and tissue-specific expression of the serine dehydratase gene in rat has been studied. The hepatic serine dehydratase activity and its mRNA showed a parallel increase with increasing protein content in the diet. However, when rats that had been maintained on a high protein diet were fed a protein-free diet, the mRNA level rapidly decreased to 0.5 in 3 h, whereas the enzyme activity gradually fell to a low level over a period of 5 days. With animals maintained on a high protein diet or on a protein-free diet, we examined the sites hypersensitive to DNase I in the 5'-flanking region of serine dehydratase gene in the liver chromatins. A series of DNase I-hypersensitive sites were located within 10.5 kilobase pairs upstream of the transcription start site. The DNA regions at -3050 and -3180 (region II) and -3600 to -3850 (region III) were more susceptible to the nuclease in the expressing than in the nonexpressing liver. A reverse situation obtained at -100 (region I). Kidney contained serine dehydratase mRNA at a level of 5% of liver as determined by Northern blotting. The kidney chromatin was found to be susceptible to DNase I only at region I. No conspicuous DNase I-hypersensitive sites were observed in the relevant regions of chromatins from brain and lung, in which serine dehydratase mRNA was scarcely transcribed. These results suggest that nutritional control and tissue-specific expression of the serine dehydratase gene is closely associated with the alteration of DNase I hypersensitivity at specific sites of the 5'-flanking region of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1555149489,"5-Iodouracil was a substrate for bovine liver dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DHPDHase) and was a potent inactivator of the enzyme. NADPH increased the rate of inactivation and thymine protected against inactivation. These findings suggest that 5-iodouracil was a mechanism-based inactivator. However, dithiothreitol and excess 5-iodouracil protected the enzyme against inactivation. Thus, a reactive product, presumably 5-iodo-5,6-dihydrouracil generated through the enzymatic reduction of 5-iodouracil, was released from DHPDHase during processing of 5-iodouracil. Since only 18% of [6-3H]5-iodouracil reduced by DHPDHase was covalently bound to the enzyme and radiolabel was not lost to the solvent as tritium, the partition coefficient for inactivation was 4.5. However, the enzymatic activity was completely titrated with 1.7 mol of 5-iodouracil per mol of enzyme-bound flavin. These results indicate that there was 0.31 mol of enzyme-bound inactivator per mol of enzyme flavin. This suggests there were 3.2 flavins per active site, which is consistent with the report of multiple flavins per enzymic subunit (Podschun, B., Wahler, G., and Schnackerz, K. D. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 185, 219-224). DHPDHase was inactivated by 2.1 mol of racemic 5-iodo-5,6-dihydrouracil per mol of active sites. The stoichiometry for inactivation of the enzyme by the nonenzymatically generated enantiomer of 5-iodo-5,6-dihydrouracil was calculated to be 1. Two radiolabeled fragments were isolated from a tryptic digest of DHPDHase inactivated with radiolabeled 5-iodouracil. The amino acid sequences of these peptides were Asn-Leu-Ser-X-Pro-His and Asn-Leu-Ser-X-Pro-His-Gly-Met-Gly-Glu-Arg where X was the modified amino acid containing radiolabel from [6-3H]5-iodouracil. Fast atom bombardment mass spectral analysis of the smaller peptide yielded a protonated parent ion mass of 782 daltons that was consistent with X being a S-(hexahydro-2,4-dioxo-5-pyrimidinyl)cysteinyl residue."
https://openalex.org/W1534335000,"We have solved the single crystal structure to 1.2-A resolution of the Z-DNA sequence d(CGCGCG) soaked with copper(II) chloride. This structure allows us to elucidate the structural properties of copper in a model that mimics a physiologically relevant environment. A copper(II) cation was observed to form a covalent coordinate bond to N-7 of each guanine base along the hexamer duplex. The occurrence of copper bound at each site was dependent on the exposure of the bases and the packing of the hexamers in the crystal. The copper at the highest occupied site was observed to form a regular octahedral complex, with four water ligands in the equatorial plane and a fifth water along with N-7 of the purine base at the axial positions. All other copper complexes appear to be variations of this structure. By using the octahedral complex as the prototype for copper(II) binding to guanine bases in the Z-DNA crystal, model structures were built showing that duplex B-DNA can accommodate octahedral copper(II) complexes at the guanine bases as well as copper complexes bridged at adjacent guanine residues by a reactive dioxygen species. The increased susceptibility to oxidative DNA cleavage induced by copper(II) ions in solution of the bases located 5' to one or more adjacent guanine residues can thus be explained in terms of the cation and DNA structures described by these models."
https://openalex.org/W1558908357,"It has recently been shown that caldesmon from non-muscle (Yamashiro, S., Yamakita, Y., Hosoya, H., and Matsumura, F. (1991) Nature 349, 169-172) and smooth muscle cells (Mak, A. S., Watson, M. H., Litwin, C. M. E., and Wang, J. H. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 6678-6681) can be phosphorylated in vitro by p34cdc2 kinase resulting in the inhibition of caldesmon binding to F-actin and Ca(2+)-calmodulin. In this study, we have identified five phosphorylation sites in smooth muscle caldesmon at Ser582, Ser667, Thr673, Thr696, and Ser702. All the sites bear some resemblance to the S(T)-P-X-X motif recognized by p34cdc2. The preferred site of phosphorylation at Thr673 accounts for about 40% of the total phosphorylation. Four of the sites occur in two pairs of closely spaced sites, Ser667/Thr673 and Thr696/Ser702; phosphorylation of one site in each pair inhibits strongly the phosphorylation of the second site in the same pair, presumably due to the close proximity of the two sites. Similar negative cooperativity in phosphorylation of Ser667 and Thr673 was observed using a 22-residue synthetic peptide containing the two sites. Phosphorylation of Ser667/Thr673 and Thr696/Ser702 account for about 90% of the total level of phosphorylation and these sites are located within the 10-kDa CNBr fragment at the COOH-terminal end of caldesmon known to bind actin and Ca(2+)-calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1548811713,"Diphtheria toxin receptor has been solubilized from Vero cell membranes with octyl beta-D-glucoside. CRM197, the product of a mutated diphtheria toxin gene, was used for the identification of the receptor. The binding activity of the solubilized receptor was assayed by precipitating the receptor with acetone in the presence of phospholipids and carrier proteins. The solubilized receptor was purified by the combination of several chromatographic steps in the presence of the detergent, resulting in about a 10(6)-fold purification of the receptor. The purified receptor showed essentially a single band of 14.5 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When partially purified receptor fractions were subjected to ligand blotting analysis using 125I-CRM197 as the probe, the 14.5-kDa protein and a few minor protein bands were identified as diphtheria toxin-binding molecules. These results show clearly that the 14.5-kDa protein is the diphtheria toxin receptor, or at least the major diphtheria toxin-binding molecule. When partially purified receptor was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column in the presence of detergent, the receptor was eluted in the fractions corresponding to the 60-90-kDa size range. This suggests that the protein forms a complex with itself or with another protein."
https://openalex.org/W1518995778,"The single crystal structure of d(m5CGUAm5CG) soaked with copper(II) chloride was solved to atomic (1.3 A) resolution to study the base specificity of copper binding to double-stranded DNA. In the present copper(II) chloride-soaked structure, four crystallographically unique copper(II) complexes were observed bound to five of the six purine bases in the hexamer duplex. Covalent copper(II) binding occurred at N-7 of all four guanine bases and at one of the two adenine bases in the DNA duplex. Copper binding was not observed at the position (Ade4) located in an open solvent channel, whereas the second adenine site (Ade10) shared a complex with a guanine residue (Gua12) of a neighboring symmetry-related hexamer. The coordination geometries and distribution of these copper(II) complexes at the guanine bases in the crystal were comparable to the analogous sites in the isomorphous copper(II) chloride-soaked d(CGCGCG) crystal (Kagawa, T., Geierstanger, B. H., Wang, A. H.-J., and Ho, P.S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20175-20184). Thus, the decreased copper(II) binding affinity for Ade4 was not an artifact of crystal packing, but is intrinsic to the chemical properties of this purine base in duplex DNA. This suggests that the adenine bases in dilute solutions of Z-DNA and more generally other duplex DNA conformations are not susceptible to copper(II) modification. Thus, preferential copper(II) binding at guanine bases over adenine bases in double-stranded DNA may explain the observed specificity of copper(II)-induced oxidative DNA damage near guanine residues (Yamamoto, K., and Kawanishi, S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15435-15440; Sagripanti, J.-L., and Kraemer, K. H. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1729-1734). The sharing of a single copper(II) complex by Ade10 and Gua12 of an adjacent hexamer suggests that additional and perhaps specific DNA-DNA interactions, as may be found in the densely packed environment of the nuclear matrix in the cell, may render N-7 of adenine bases prone to copper(II) modification."

In some of the cases, we succeeded on the first try while using only minute amounts of protein. This study proves that the Incomplete Factorial Approach is a powerful tool in identifying the factors that need to be varied to achieve crystallization. Single crystals of adequate size were obtained for all the proteins reported here, although some did not diffract well enough to be studied by x-ray diffraction methods; the asymmetric units of these latter crystals contain a large metric units of these latter crystals contain a large number of molecules, which is most likely due to the presence of significant amounts of carbohydrate in the proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1788082166,"Caldesmon interacts with the NH2-terminal region of actin. It is now shown in airfuge centrifugation experiments that modification of the penultimate cysteine residue of actin significantly weakens its binding to caldesmon both in the presence and absence of tropomyosin. Furthermore, as revealed by fluorescence measurements, caldesmon increases the exposure of the COOH-terminal region of actin to the solvent. This effect of caldesmon, like its inhibitory effect on actomyosin ATPase activity, is enhanced in the presence of tropomyosin. Proteolytic removal of the last three COOH-terminal residues of actin, containing the modified cysteine residue, restores the normal binding between caldesmon and actin. These results establish a correlation between the binding of caldesmon to actin and the conformation of the COOH-terminal region of actin and suggest an indirect rather than direct interaction between caldesmon and this part of actin."
https://openalex.org/W1500574152,"Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) is a 45-kDa peptide mitogen which is present in platelets and placenta and produced by certain cultured cell lines. Immunoprecipitation of A431 cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate revealed the incorporation of 32P radioactivity into PD-ECGF. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that serine residues of PD-ECGF were phosphorylated in vivo. Forskolin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, and epidermal growth factor had no effect on the in vivo phosphorylation of PD-ECGF. Moreover, incubation of pure PD-ECGF with [gamma-32P]ATP led to labeling of PD-ECGF. Optimal labeling was achieved by incubation at 95 degrees C for 5 min in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, dithiothreitol, and Mg2+ or Mn2+. PD-ECGF was also labeled with [2,8-3H]ATP, [2,5',8-3H]ATP, or [alpha-32P]ATP. ATP and GTP were the preferred nucleotide substrates by comparison with other nucleotides and related components. Partial amino acid hydrolysis liberated a significant amount of O-[32P]phosphoserine from PD-ECGF labeled in vitro with [gamma-32P] ATP. Furthermore, 32P-radiolabeled nucleotides were released after snake venom phosphodiesterase or piperidine treatment from PD-ECGF labeled in vitro with [alpha-32P]ATP or [gamma-32P]ATP, as well as from PD-ECGF labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate. These data indicate that serine residues of PD-ECGF can be covalently linked to phosphate groups of nucleotides, resulting in a nucleotidylated protein. The functional significance of this post-translational modification remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1523094058,"In the simple adenovirus 2 early 1B (E1B) promoter, moving the single Sp1 transcription factor binding site (GC box) from its wild-type position eight base pairs (bp) from the TATA box to 30 bp upstream is equivalent to its deletion (Wu, L., and Berk, A. (1988) Genes & Dev. 2, 403-411). In more complex promoters, multiple upstream elements regulate transcription over greater distances. To understand these spacing constraints, we placed two GC boxes in phase at various distances from the E1B TATA box. Whereas one GC box at eight bp from TATA increases transcription in vivo 5-fold compared with TATA alone (Wu, L., Rosser, D. S. E., Schmidt, M. C., and Berk, A. (1987) Nature 326, 512-515), two GC boxes increased in vivo transcription 25-30-fold. Transcriptional stimulation by two GC boxes fell off rapidly in vivo at 30 bp from TATA, remained approximately constant through 50 bp, then decreased again at 70 bp. Consequently, two GC boxes have a multiplicative effect at eight bp from TATA and continue to stimulate transcription at a greater distance from TATA than a single Sp1 site. Quantitatively different results were observed for in vitro transcription using a nuclear extract; a more linear fall off with increasing distance from TATA was observed. Separating the two GC boxes progressively decreased transcription. E1A stimulation of these promoters in vivo indicates that Sp1 transcription control is independent of E1A transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1601533531,"Cellular receptors for many hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors are coupled to intracellular effector enzymes or ion channels through a set of heterotrimeric G proteins. In order to determine whether isoforms of G protein alpha subunits contribute differentially to mitogenic responses, we introduced an alpha subunit isoform, alpha i-1, into Balb/c 3T3 cells that normally lack this subtype. Balb/c 3T3 cells transfected with a plasmid containing cDNA encoding alpha i-1 expressed the alpha i-1 protein as judged both by the appearance of immunoreactive alpha i-1 protein on Western blots and by two-dimensional analysis of the proteins [32P]ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin. The amount of alpha i-1 expressed is less than the amount of alpha subunits endogenously present in these cells. Expression of alpha i-1 in the transfected cells slightly blunts stimulation of adenylylcyclase by GTP, guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, or forskolin, but has no major effect on the ability of thrombin to inhibit the enzyme. In contrast, the expression of alpha i-1 has significant effects on cell growth and on the mitogenic response to thrombin. The alpha i-1-transfected cells have a doubling time that is twice as long as control cells transfected with the same plasmid without a cDNA insert. Despite their slower growth, thymidine incorporation in response to thrombin is greater in transfected than in control cells. Thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis is sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin and is 5-fold more sensitive to inhibition by pertussis toxin in transfected cells than in control cells. The changes are receptor-specific since the mitogenic response to platelet-derived growth factor is indistinguishable between control and transfected cells. These studies suggest that the alpha i subunit composition of the cell may have profound effects on its growth and its response to stimulation through a specific cell surface receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1548800422,"Protein phosphorylation by activation of protein kinase C was examined using quiescent cultures of the mouse epidermal keratinocyte line BALB/MK-2. Treatment with phorbol ester caused rapid phosphorylation of five proteins with molecular weights of 80,000, 70,000, 40,000, 34,000, 28,000. Of these proteins, the 70,000 molecular weight one (p70) was studied further. Its position on two-dimensional gel suggested that p70 is nuclear envelope lamin B. This possibility was confirmed by the co-migration of p70 with the lamin fraction of mouse liver and its immunoprecipitation with antinuclear lamina antibody. The lamin B fraction consists of lamin B1 and lamin B2. Evidence that p70 is lamin B2 was obtained by peptide mapping and amino acid sequencing. Lamin B2 is the only lamin that shows a substantial increase in phosphorylation on treatment of BALB/MK-2 cells with phorbol ester."
https://openalex.org/W1593971807,"Thirty-nine mutant tryptophan synthase alpha subunits have been purified and analyzed (in the presence of the beta 2-subunit) for their enzymatic (kcat, Km) behavior in the reactions catalyzed by the alpha 2.beta 2 complex, the fully constituted form of this enzyme. The mutant alpha subunits, obtained by in vitro random, saturation mutagenesis of the encoding trpA gene, contain single amino acid substitutions at sites within the first 121 residues of the alpha polypeptide. Four categories of altered residues have been tentatively assigned roles in the catalytic functions of this enzyme: 1) catalytic residues (Glu49 and Asp60); 2) residues involved in substrate binding or orientation (Phe22, Thr63, Gln65, Tyr102, and Leu105); 3) residues involved in alpha.beta subunit interactions (Gly51, Pro53, Asp56, Asp60, Pro62, Ala67, Phe72, Thr77, Pro78, Tyr102, Asn104, Leu105, and Asn108); and 4) residues with no apparent catalytic roles. Catalytic residue alterations result in no detectable activity in the alpha-subunit specific reactions. Substrate binding/orientation roles are detected enzymatically primarily as rate defects; alterations only at Tyr102 result in apparent Km effects. alpha.beta interaction roles are detected as rate defects in all tryptophan synthase reactions plus Km increases for the alpha-subunit substrate, indole-3-glycerol phosphate, only when L-serine is present at the beta 2-subunit active site. A substitution at only one site, Asn104, appears to be unique in its potential effect on intersubunit channeling of indole, the product of the alpha-subunit specific reaction, to the beta 2-subunit active site."
https://openalex.org/W1589516143,"Signal sequences play a central role in the initial membrane translocation of secretory proteins. Their functions depend on factors such as hydrophobicity and conformation of the signal sequences themselves. However, some characteristics of mature proteins, especially those of the N-terminal region, might also affect the function of the signal sequences. To examine this possibility, several mutants of human lysozyme modified in the N-terminal region of the mature protein were constructed, and their secretion in yeast as well as in vitro translocation into canine pancreatic microsomes were analyzed using an idealized signal sequence L8 (MR(L)8PLAALG). Our results show the following. (1) Change in the charge at the N-terminal residue of the mature protein does not affect secretion drastically. (2) Substitution of a proline residue at the N terminus prevents cleavage of the signal sequence, although translocation itself is not impaired. (3) Excessive positive charges in the N-terminal region delay translocation of the precursor protein across the membrane. (4) Polar and negatively charged residues introduced into the N-terminal region affect the secretion of the mature protein by preventing its correct folding."
https://openalex.org/W1480599751,"The folC gene from mutant strain SF4 was cloned into a pUC19 plasmid. Expression of the mutant gene from the lac promoter of the plasmid complemented the auxotrophy for methionine of the SF4 strain. The only difference in sequence between the mutant and wild-type genes was a G925A base change resulting in an A309T amino acid change. The mutant enzyme had a 30-fold higher Km for 10-formyltetrahydrofolate as well as a 60-fold higher Km for glutamate and a 200-fold higher Km for dihydropteroate of the dihydrofolate synthetase activity. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to substitute other amino acids at codon 309. Mutants with glycine, isoleucine, and valine substitutions at this position, when expressed from multicopy plasmids, complemented the SF4 strain. The glycine mutant had properties similar to the wild-type enzyme, whereas the isoleucine and valine mutants had properties similar to the threonine mutant, SF4. Mutant genes with arginine, glutamate, and leucine substitutions, which did not complement the SF4 strain, could complement a folC deletion strain, but produced smaller colonies on complex plates and did not grow on minimal medium. In the deletion strain, an increasing requirement for folate product supplements was observed as the folylpolyglutamate synthetase-dihydrofolate synthetase activities of the complementing mutants decreased."
https://openalex.org/W1542447386,"Bovine heart microsomes have been found to contain a non-heme iron protein which serves as an electron acceptor for NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and therefore stimulates NADPH oxidation. This protein, tentatively referred to as Microsomal Iron Protein (MIP), has been extracted with Triton N-101 and purified by ion exchange chromatography on CM- and DEAE-celluloses and gel filtration on Sepharose 6B. MIP is an Mr = 66,000 monomer with 17 atoms of Fe(III)/molecule. Incubation with dithionite removes iron from MIP and abolishes the stimulation of NADPH oxidation, but subsequent incubation with nitrilotriacetic-Fe(III) reincorporates iron and restores the stimulation of NADPH oxidation. Oxygen is the ultimate electron acceptor. In the presence of oxygen, the enzymatic reduction of MIP Fe(III) is followed by the reoxidation of Fe(II) at the expense of oxygen, generating superoxide anion and regenerating MIP Fe(III) for the continuous oxidation of NADPH. In the absence of oxygen, electron transfer from the reductase to MIP Fe(III) causes the release of Fe(II), which limits the ability of MIP to serve as an electron acceptor and stimulate NADPH oxidation. The--NH2-terminal of MIP has been sequenced, and no homology has been found with the sequence of other iron storage or transport proteins such as ferritin or transferrin."
