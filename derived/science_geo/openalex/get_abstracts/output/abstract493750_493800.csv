https://openalex.org/W1970015104,"Non- small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Paclitaxel based combination therapies have long been used as a standard treatment in aggressive NSCLCs. But paclitaxel resistance has emerged as a major clinical problem in combating non-small-cell lung cancer and autophagy is one of the important mechanisms involved in this phenomenon. In this study, we used microRNA (miRNA) arrays to screen differentially expressed miRNAs between paclitaxel sensitive lung cancer cells A549 and its paclitaxel-resistant cell variant (A549-T24). We identified miR-17-5p was one of most significantly downregulated miRNAs in paclitaxel-resistant lung cancer cells compared to paclitaxel sensitive parental cells. We found that overexpression of miR-17-5p sensitized paclitaxel resistant lung cancer cells to paclitaxel induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover, in this report we demonstrated that miR-17-5p directly binds to the 3′-UTR of beclin 1 gene, one of the most important autophagy modulator. Overexpression of miR-17-5p into paclitaxel resistant lung cancer cells reduced beclin1 expression and a concordant decease in cellular autophagy. We also observed similar results in another paclitaxel resistant lung adenosquamous carcinoma cells (H596-TxR). Our results indicated that paclitaxel resistance of lung cancer is associated with downregulation of miR-17-5p expression which might cause upregulation of BECN1 expression."

The mechanism underlying the increase in marrow fat and bone destruction remains elusive. We found that on the way of adipogenic differentiation of marrow stromal cells, receptor activator for NF-κB ligand (Rankl) expression was induced, concomitantly with a down-regulation of osteoprotegerin, which prompted us to hypothesize that cells at a preadipocyte stage express RANKL. This concept was supported by the findings that the early adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, but not the late factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, bind to the Rankl promoter and stimulate Rankl gene transcription. In fact, when cells isolated from the bone marrow of aging mice were analyzed by flow cytometry, we found that cells expressing the pre-adipocyte marker Pref-1 were RANKL-positive, and the number of these cells was increased with aging, with concomitant down-regulation of osteoprotegerin, and most importantly, that these RANKL(+)/Pref-1(+) marrow cells were capable of generating osteoclasts from bone marrow macrophages. Thus, the capacity of cells at a pre-adipocyte stage to express RANKL via C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ and to support osteoclastogenesis may account partly for the co-progression of fatty marrow and bone destruction with aging."
https://openalex.org/W1981039934,"Envelope biogenesis in bacteria involves synthesis of intermediates that are tethered to the lipid carrier undecaprenol-phosphate. LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) enzymes have been proposed to catalyze the transfer of undecaprenol-linked intermediates onto the C6-hydroxyl of MurNAc in peptidoglycan, thereby promoting attachment of wall teichoic acid (WTA) in bacilli and staphylococci and capsular polysaccharides (CPS) in streptococci. S. aureus encodes three lcp enzymes, and a variant lacking all three genes (Δlcp) releases WTA from the bacterial envelope and displays a growth defect. Here, we report that the type 5 capsular polysaccharide (CP5) of Staphylococcus aureus Newman is covalently attached to the glycan strands of peptidoglycan. Cell wall attachment of CP5 is abrogated in the Δlcp variant, a defect that is best complemented via expression of lcpC in trans. CP5 synthesis and peptidoglycan attachment are not impaired in the tagO mutant, suggesting that CP5 synthesis does not involve the GlcNAc-ManNAc linkage unit of WTA and may instead utilize another Wzy-type ligase to assemble undecaprenyl-phosphate intermediates. Thus, LCP enzymes of S. aureus are promiscuous enzymes that attach secondary cell wall polymers with discrete linkage units to peptidoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2006393063,"Cellular energy influences all aspects of cellular function. Although cells can adapt to a gradual reduction in energy, acute energy depletion poses a unique challenge. Because acute depletion hampers the transport of new energy sources into the cell, the cell must use endogenous substrates to replenish energy after acute depletion. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose starvation causes an acute depletion of intracellular energy that recovers during continued glucose starvation. However, how the cell replenishes energy during the early phase of glucose starvation is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of pathways that deliver proteins and lipids to the vacuole during glucose starvation. We report that in response to glucose starvation, plasma membrane proteins are directed to the vacuole through reduced recycling at the endosomes. Furthermore, we found that vacuolar hydrolysis inhibits macroautophagy in a target of rapamycin complex 1-dependent manner. Accordingly, we found that endocytosis and hydrolysis are required for survival in glucose starvation, whereas macroautophagy is dispensable. Together, these results suggest that hydrolysis of components delivered to the vacuole independent of autophagy is the cell survival mechanism used by S. cerevisiae in response to glucose starvation."
https://openalex.org/W2045570718,"The transcription factor STAT3 is constitutively active in several malignancies including castration-resistant prostate cancer and has been identified as a promising therapeutic target. The fungal metabolite galiellalactone, a STAT3 signaling inhibitor, inhibits the growth, both in vitro and in vivo, of prostate cancer cells expressing active STAT3 and induces apoptosis of prostate cancer stem cell-like cells expressing phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3). However, the molecular mechanism of this STAT3-inhibiting effect by galiellalactone has not been clarified. A biotinylated analogue of galiellalactone (GL-biot) was synthesized to be used for identification of galiellalactone target proteins. By adding streptavidin-Sepharose beads to GL-biot-treated DU145 cell lysates, STAT3 was isolated and identified as a target protein. Confocal microscopy revealed GL-biot in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of DU145 cells treated with GL-biot, appearing to co-localize with STAT3 in the nucleus. Galiellalactone inhibited STAT3 binding to DNA in DU145 cell lysates without affecting phosphorylation status of STAT3. Mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant STAT3 protein pretreated with galiellalactone revealed three modified cysteines (Cys-367, Cys-468, and Cys-542). Here we demonstrate with chemical and molecular pharmacological methods that galiellalactone is a cysteine reactive inhibitor that covalently binds to one or more cysteines in STAT3 and that this leads to inhibition of STAT3 binding to DNA and thus blocks STAT3 signaling without affecting phosphorylation. This further validates galiellalactone as a promising direct STAT3 inhibitor for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2021472989,"The chemokine CXCL10/IP-10 facilitates recruitment of Th1-type leukocytes to inflammatory sites. In this study, we show that the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 is critical for CXCL10 transcription in TNF-α-activated human endothelial cells (EC). We found that depletion of PRMT5 results in significantly reduced levels of CXCL10 mRNA, demonstrating a positive role for PRMT5 in CXCL10 induction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed the presence of the symmetrical dimethylarginine modification catalyzed by PRMT5 associated with the CXCL10 promoter in response to TNF-α. However, symmetrical dimethylarginine-modified proteins were not detected at the promoter in the absence of PRMT5, indicating that PRMT5 is essential for methylation to occur. Furthermore, NF-κB p65, a critical driver of TNF-α-mediated CXCL10 induction, was determined to be methylated at arginine residues. Crucially, RNAi-mediated PRMT5 depletion abrogated p65 methylation and CXCL10 promoter binding. Mass spectrometric analysis in EC identified five dimethylated arginine residues in p65, four of which are uncharacterized in the literature. Expression of Arg-to-Lys point mutants of p65 demonstrated that both Arg-30 and Arg-35 must be dimethylated to achieve full CXCL10 expression. In conclusion, we have identified previously uncharacterized p65 post-translational modifications critical for CXCL10 induction.

Arginine residues in mammalian proteins can carry zero, one, or two methyl groups on their terminal (ω) nitrogen atoms. Methylation eliminates a potential hydrogen bond, adds bulk, and increases hydrophobicity but does not alter arginine's positive charge.

To complement our previous studies of arginine methylation in the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules (2Bandyopadhyay S. Harris D.P. Adams G.N. Lause G.E. McHugh A. Tillmaand E.G. Money A. Willard B. Fox P.L. Dicorleto P.E. HOXA9 methylation by PRMT5 is essential for endothelial cell expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 1202-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we chose to examine roles of PRMT5 in expression of chemoattractive cytokines (chemokines). Most proinflammatory chemokines are secreted proteins that promote recruitment, adherence, and extravasation of circulating leukocytes (10Groom J.R. Luster A.D. CXCR3 ligands: redundant, collaborative and antagonistic functions.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2011; 89: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 11Zernecke A. Shagdarsuren E. Weber C. Chemokines in atherosclerosis: an update.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1897-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We determined that the chemokine CXCL10 requires PRMT5 to achieve full induction in response to TNF-α. CXCL10 has been extensively studied since its discovery in 1985 by Luster et al. (12Luster A.D. Unkeless J.C. Ravetch J.V. γ-Interferon transcriptionally regulates an early-response gene containing homology to platelet proteins.Nature. 1985; 315: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) due to its contributions to numerous pathologies involving Th1-type inflammation, including atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, asthma, and immune responses to solid organ transplant and infections (10Groom J.R. Luster A.D. CXCR3 ligands: redundant, collaborative and antagonistic functions.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2011; 89: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Despite its prominence in such a wide variety of pathologies, only one published study to our knowledge has examined CXCL10 expression in EC (13Marx N. Mach F. Sauty A. Leung J.H. Sarafi M.N. Ransohoff R.M. Libby P. Plutzky J. Luster A.D. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ activators inhibit IFN-γ-induced expression of the T cell-active CXC chemokines IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC in human endothelial cells.J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6503-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). CXCL10 is rapidly induced in response to TNF-α, IFN-α/β/γ, IL-1β, or LPS (10Groom J.R. Luster A.D. CXCR3 ligands: redundant, collaborative and antagonistic functions.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2011; 89: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Secreted CXCL10 recruits and retains Th1 (type-1 helper) CD4+ T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic effector cells, natural killer, natural killer T cells, plasmocytoid dendritic cells, and some B-cell subsets at inflammatory lesions (10Groom J.R. Luster A.D. CXCR3 ligands: redundant, collaborative and antagonistic functions.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2011; 89: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 11Zernecke A. Shagdarsuren E. Weber C. Chemokines in atherosclerosis: an update.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1897-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). CXCL10 also has non-immune cell effects as a potent smooth muscle cell mitogen and chemotactic agent and as a vascular angiostatic factor (14Wang X. Yue T.L. Ohlstein E.H. Sung C.P. Feuerstein G.Z. Interferon-inducible protein-10 involves vascular smooth muscle cell migration, proliferation, and inflammatory response.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24286-24293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15Angiolillo A.L. Sgadari C. Taub D.D. Liao F. Farber J.M. Maheshwari S. Kleinman H.K. Reaman G.H. Tosato G. Human interferon-inducible protein 10 is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo.J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). CXCL10 induction is driven in part by NF-κB transcription factors known as master regulators of inflammation and immunity (16Huang B. Yang X.D. Lamb A. Chen L.F. Posttranslational modifications of NF-κB: another layer of regulation for NF-κB signaling pathway.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In canonical NF-κB signaling, the latent cytosolic transcription factor NF-κB is activated by kinases that phosphorylate p65 and trigger the degradation of inhibitory IκB subunits. These events free NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus where it associates with κB sites in target promoters (16Huang B. Yang X.D. Lamb A. Chen L.F. Posttranslational modifications of NF-κB: another layer of regulation for NF-κB signaling pathway.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Multiple types of post-translation modifications of p65 are established, including roles for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. Roles of many of these modifications have been identified, including regulators of protein localization, DNA-binding affinity, interactions with other proteins, and the duration and strength of transcription (16Huang B. Yang X.D. Lamb A. Chen L.F. Posttranslational modifications of NF-κB: another layer of regulation for NF-κB signaling pathway.Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 17Leung T.H. Hoffmann A. Baltimore D. One nucleotide in a κB site can determine cofactor specificity for NF-κB dimers.Cell. 2004; 118: 453-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, a major unresolved question in the study of NF-κB remains how the various post-translational modifications of NF-κB enable specific gene activation, differential kinetics, transcription magnitude, and inducer-specific responses (18Baltimore D. NF-κB is 25.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Many of these processes are governed by post-translational modifications of NF-κB. Here, we report that the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 post-translationally modifies the p65 subunit of the NF-κB Rel-homology domain, a step imperative to the CXCL10 induction by TNF-α. Primary human EC were isolated from discarded patient samples as described previously (19Scarpati E.M. DiCorleto P.E.

Targefect F-2 and peptide enhancer transfection reagents were purchased from Targeting Systems (El Cajon, CA). siRNAs complementary to the coding sequence of PRMT5 (sense, 5′-GAGGGAGUUCAUUCAGGAAUU-3′) and the NF-κB p65 3′-UTR (sense, 5′-GGAUUCAUUACAGCUUAAUUU-3′) were designed using the Whitehead Institute siRNA design tool. siRNAs were synthesized by Ambion and contain the Silencer Select modifications. Nontargeting control Silencer Select siRNA (4390843) was purchased from Ambion. ChIP was performed using a kit from Millipore (Billerica, MA; catalog no. 17-295). Antibodies used for ChIP, IP, and Western blots included anti-PRMT5 (Millipore, catalog no. 07-405), anti-p65 (Millipore, catalog no. 06-418), anti-dimethyl-arginine, symmetric (SYM10, Millipore, catalog no. 07-412), anti-HOXA9 (Millipore, catalog no. 07-178), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma Aldrich), anti-mouse IgG1 (Cell Signaling), and anti-normal rabbit IgG (Millipore, catalog no. 12-370). Antibodies used for Western blot included anti-PRMT5 (sc-22132; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GAPDH (sc-20357; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-α-tubulin (T5168; Sigma). Recombinant TNF-α from R&D Systems was used at 2 ng/ml for all experiments. Human p65 cDNA was acquired from Addgene (construct 21966). PCR was performed to insert an N-terminal KpnI site followed by a FLAG sequence (amino acid sequence: DYKDDDDK) in-frame with the start codon. The resulting FLAG-tagged cDNA was subcloned into the KpnI and HindIII sites of pCDNA3. The FLAG-tagged fusion protein is expressed under control of the CMV promoter. Early passage (P2–4) EC pooled from multiple individual biological samples were used for all experiments. Cells were maintained in MCDB 107 medium augmented with 15% FBS, 150 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, and 90 μg/ml heparin. Cells were transfected within 24 h of passage. Both siRNA and cDNA were transfected in serum-free DMEM using targefect F-2 (5 μl/ml) and peptide enhancer (5 μl/ml) from Targeting Systems (El Cajon, CA). siRNA was transfected at a final concentration of 50 nm. cDNA was transfected at 250 ng/ml. All transfections were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, followed by replacement of the DMEM-transfection solution with complete medium containing 15% FBS. Cells were cultured for 24–48 h to allow for cDNA expression or protein knockdown. Cells were grown to confluence on 150-mm plates. Cells were separated into nuclear and cytosolic fractions using the CellLytic NuCLEAR Extraction Kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were harvested with a cell scraper, swelled in hypotonic lysis buffer, and lysed with IGEPAL-630. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed three times with hypotonic lysis buffer and lysed in 420 mm NaCl high salt extraction buffer to collect the crude nuclear fraction. Cells were lysed in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors. Endogenous proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-PRMT5 or anti-p65 antibody from Millipore and protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce). Overexpressed N-terminal tagged FLAG-p65 was pulled down using anti-FLAG-agarose magnetic beads (Sigma). Lysates were resolved on 10% bis-tris acrylamide gels (2Bandyopadhyay S. Harris D.P.

Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and blocked with 5% nonfat milk or protein-free blocking buffer (Pierce; catalog no. 37570). Blots were washed with 1× TBST or milli-Q water and incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. After transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 48 h. Following TNF-α treatment, cells were lysed with 350 μl of buffer RLT containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and processed with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) to collect RNA. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis reagents (Invitrogen). cDNA was diluted 6-fold, and real-time PCR was performed with Fast SYBR Green PCR Reagents (PE Applied Biosystems) using an ABI StepOnePlus quantitative real-time PCR machine.

For the mRNA stability experiment, actinomycin D (Sigma) was used at 1 μg/ml. Amplification, melt curves, and sequenced products indicate a single product identical to the reference sequence. Cells were plated in six-well dishes and transfected. After 24 h, 1 ml of fresh was applied. At 40 h, cells were stimulated with TNF-α for 8 h. At the end of treatment, conditioned medium was collected and assayed for the presence of CXCL10 using a sandwich ELISA kit (R&D Systems; DIP-100) and read with an iMark plate reader (Bio-Rad). Cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes, treated with TNF-α, and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Sigma) in MCDB medium. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using the PrepEase DNA Cleanup kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Primers for the CXCL10 proximal promoter are 5′-AGGAGCAGAGGGAAATTCCGTAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AACGTGGGGCTAGTGTGCCA-3′ (reverse). They amplify a 182-bp fragment between −186/−5 containing the κB2, κB1 (distal and proximal κB sites, respectively), AP-1, CAAT, and TATA elements.

DNA was quantified in 15 μl quantitative real-time PCR reactions using Power SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) with 40 cycles of amplification. Cells were plated in triplicate in 24-well plates and transfected with a plasmid encoding −875 to +97 bp of the human CXCL10 promoter (GL-IP10) upstream of firefly luciferase in promoterless pGL3-basic.

Cells were cultured for 24 h and then treated with TNF-α for 6 h, washed twice with MCDB medium, and lysed in 60 μl/well passive lysis buffer (Promega). 20 μl of lysate was pipetted in triplicate into 96-well luciferase plates, activated with luciferase substrate (Promega), and measured with a Dynex luminometer. Coomassie-stained bands of overexpressed p65 were excised (∼65 kDa) and digested in-gel with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or GluC, and analyzed by capillary column LC-tandem mass spectrometry to identify methylated peptides. Enzymatic digestion was carried out at room temperature overnight. We used a Finnigan LTQ (linear trap quadrapole) ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) and a self-packed 9 cm × 75 μm inner diameter Phenomenex Jupiter C18 reversed phase capillary chromatography column. Peptides were analyzed using collision-induced dissociation spectra to search the NCBI non-redundant protein database and manually interpreted with reference to the Sequest and BLAST programs as needed.

In each reaction, 0.3 μg of PRMT5, 1.0 μg of p65, and S-adenosylmethionine was added to a final concentration of 80 μm.

Arginine methylation was detected by immunoblotting for SDMA. A FLAG tag was added to the N terminus of the RelA-pCMV4 construct (22Ballard D.W. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J. Bogerd H. Doerre S. Stein B.

Arginine residues identified as methylation targets were mutated to lysine via the GeneArt Mutagenesis System (Invitrogen). Arginine-to-lysine mutant constructs were co-transfected along with CMV-lacZ reporter plasmid and 3′-UTR targeting sip65, introduced to knockdown endogenous p65. Cells were maintained for 45 h and then stimulated with TNF-α for 3 h. RNA was collected, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed for chemokine expression. Results are presented as means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were evaluated by one- or two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests to evaluate pairwise comparisons. Multiple comparisons were performed by Student's t test. A p value ≤ 0.05 was selected as the cutoff for significance. p values are expressed in the figures as follows: *, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.005. For all experiments, n = 3–4, with the exception of the mass spectrometric analysis (n = 2). Our group has reported previously that PRMT5 positively regulates expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and E-selectin in TNF-α-stimulated EC (2Bandyopadhyay S. Harris D.P. Adams G.N. Lause G.E. McHugh A. Tillmaand E.G. Money A. Willard B. Fox P.L. Dicorleto P.E. HOXA9 methylation by PRMT5 is essential for endothelial cell expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 1202-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, we extended our study and explored the regulatory role of PRMT5 in the TNF-α induction of chemokines that are involved in vascular disease pathogenesis. To identify the role of PRMT5 in inflammatory chemokine gene expression, we compared TNF-α-induced mRNA levels of chemokines in PRMT5 intact versus PRMT5-depleted EC. Transfection of PRMT5 siRNA yielded >80% knockdown of PRMT5 protein (Fig. 1A). Depletion of PRMT5 in EC led to substantial decrease (>60%) in induction of both CXCL10 (Fig. 1B) and CX3CL1/fractalkine (Fig. 1C) message levels. Thus, PRMT5 is necessary to achieve full induction of these chemokines in stimulated EC. In contrast, expression of both CXCL8/IL-8 (Fig. 1D) and CCL2/MCP-1 (Fig. 1E) were unaffected by the absence of PRMT5. Thus, we conclude that PRMT5 is required for the expression of specific proinflammatory chemokines, including CXCL10 (Fig. 1B) and CX3CL1 (Fig. 1C) in EC. In this study, we focused on elucidating the mechanism of PRMT5's contribution to CXCL10 expression. To differentiate between potential roles for PRMT5 in transcriptional versus post-transcriptional processes, we measured CXCL10 pre-mRNA in TNF-α-stimulated EC with quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of CXCL10 pre-mRNA in PRMT5-depleted cells were significantly lower compared with control cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that regulation occurs at the level of transcription. Under some circumstances, chemokine production is modulated by regulating mRNA half-life (23Hamilton T.A. Novotny M. Datta S. Mandal P. Hartupee J. Tebo J. Li X. Chemokine and chemoattractant receptor expression: post-transcriptional regulation.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 82: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To assess a possible role for PRMT5 in CXCL10 mRNA stability, we blocked de novo transcription with actinomycin D and observed no significant difference in message stability with and without PRMT5 (Fig. 2B). To provide further evidence for the role of PRMT5 in CXCL10 expression, we transfected into EC a promoter-reporter construct consisting of a 1-kb fragment of the CXCL10 promoter proximal to the transcription start site cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter. Results from this assay showed significantly diminished promoter activity from PRMT5-depleted cells compared with control (Fig. 2C). We also analyzed CXCL10 protein levels via ELISA assay in EC conditioned medium following 8 h of TNF-α stimulation. EC lacking PRMT5 showed significant reduction as compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2D). This finding is consistent with the mRNA result presented in Fig. 1B. Taken together, we conclude that PRMT5 regulates TNF-α-stimulated induction of CXCL10 at the transcriptional level. Considering the positive contribution of PRMT5 to CXCL10 transcription, we next asked whether the SDMA modification could be detected at the CXCL10 promoter. To address this question, we employed ChIP assays using an antibody specific for SDMA, and PCR primers that amplify a region of the proximal promoter critical for CXCL10 induction (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, our ChIP results demonstrated the presence of SDMA-containing proteins on the CXCL10 proximal promoter in TNF-α-stimulated EC. Importantly, when PRMT5 is knocked down in stimulated cells, promoter amplification was at background level (Fig. 3B). These results therefore suggest that PRMT5 symmetrically dimethylates at least one protein associated with the CXCL10 promoter in response to TNF-α-stimulation in EC. In a previous investigation, we showed that PRMT5 and HOXA9 associate on the promoters of E-selectin and VCAM-1 upon TNF-α exposure in EC. We investigated whether CXCL10 induction occurs though the same mechanism (2Bandyopadhyay S. Harris D.P. Adams G.N. Lause G.E. McHugh A. Tillmaand E.G. Money A. Willard B. Fox P.L. Dicorleto P.E. HOXA9 methylation by PRMT5 is essential for endothelial cell expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 1202-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We performed ChIP experiments to assess whether HOXA9 could be identified together with PRMT5 at the CXCL10 promoter. We did not detect CXCL10 promoter enrichment of either HOXA9 (Fig. 3C) or PRMT5 (Fig. 3D) in unstimulated or stimulated EC. Together, the ChIP results indicated that PRMT5 catalyzes methylation of at least one DNA-binding protein that associates with the CXCL10 promoter following TNF-α activation of EC. Methylation appears to occur prior to association with the CXCL10 promoter. To identify SDMA-modified proteins that associate with the CXCL10 promoter following TNF-α activation, we immunoprecipitated transcription factors known to associate with the CXCL10 proximal promoter (Fig. 3A) such as NF-κB p65, p300, and STAT1 (21Majumder S. Zhou L.Z. Chaturvedi P. Babcock G. Aras S. Ransohoff R.M. p48/STAT-1α-containing complexes play a predominant role in induction of IFN-γ-inducible protein, 10 kDa (IP-10) by IFN-γ alone or in synergy with TNF-α.J.

Of these factors, only NF-κB p65 was symmetrically dimethylated in both the stimulated and unstimulated states as detected by the anti-symmetrical dimethylarginine antibody (Fig. 4A, and data not shown). To test whether the arginine methylation detected on p65 is catalyzed by PRMT5, we depleted PRMT5 with siRNA, immunoprecipitated p65, and assessed the SDMA levels by Western blot. PRMT5 knockdown resulted in a substantial decrease (>80%) in arginine methylation levels of both untreated and TNF-α-stimulated lysates (Fig. 4B).

In a separate series of experiments C21 was administered in a series of 4 doses commencing 6 hours after stroke. A focal reperfusion model of ischemia was induced in conscious SHR by administering endothelin-1 to the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Motor coordination was assessed at 1 and 3 days after stroke and post mortem analyses of infarct volumes, microglia activation and neuronal survival were performed at 72 hours post MCA occlusion. When given prior to stroke, C21 dose dependently decreased infarct volume, which is consistent with the behavioural findings illustrating an improvement in motor deficit. During the pre-treatment protocol C21 was shown to enhance microglia activation, which are likely to be evoking protection by releasing brain derived neurotrophic factor. When drug administration was delayed until 6 hours after stroke, C21 still reduced brain injury.These results indicate that centrally administered C21 confers neuroprotection against stroke damage. This benefit is likely to involve various mechanisms, including microglial activation of endogenous repair and enhanced cerebroperfusion. Thus, we have confirmed the neuroprotective effect of AT2R stimulation using a nonpeptide compound which highlights the clinical potential of the AT2R agonists for future development."
https://openalex.org/W2035939667,"The malaria parasite experiences a significant amount of redox stress during its growth in human erythrocytes and heavily relies on secretory functions for pathogenesis. Most certainly, the parasite is equipped with machinery to tackle perturbations in the secretory pathway, like the unfolded protein response pathway in higher eukaryotes. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed the complete absence of genes involved in the canonical unfolded protein response pathway in Plasmodium falciparum. Accordingly, the parasite was unable to up-regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones or ER-associated degradation in response to DTT-mediated ER stress. Global profiling of gene expression upon DTT treatment revealed a network of AP2 transcription factors and their targets being activated. The overall outcome was up-regulation of genes involved in protein export and the sexual stage of the parasite life cycle culminating in gametocytogenesis. Our results suggest that the malaria parasite uses ER stress as a cue to switch to the transmissible sexual stages."

The objectives of this paper were to determine the prevalence of depression, its associated factors and the predictors of depression among adults in the community of Selangor.A cross sectional study was conducted in three districts in Selangor, from 11th June to 30th December 2012. The sampling frame was obtained from the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOS) in May 2012, using the National Population and Housing Census 2010. Adults aged 18 years and above, living in the selected living quarters were approached to participate in the study and requested to complete a set of questionnaires.A total of 1,556 out of 2,152 participants participated in this study, giving an overall study response rate of 61.90%. Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was used to determine the presence of depression. The prevalence of depression was 10.3%, based on the PHQ-9 cut off point of 10 and above. Based on multiple logistic regression analysis, the predictors of depression were presence of anxiety, serious problems at work, unhappy relationship with children, high perceived stress, domestic violence, unhappy relationship with spouse, low self-esteem, unhappy relationship with family, serious financial constraint and presence of chronic diseases. When reanalyzed after removing anxiety, high perceived stress and low self-esteem, additional predictors of depression were found to be serious marital problems and religiosity.The prevalence of depression in this study is similar to that found in other studies. Findings from this study are being used as baseline data to develop an effective program to assist in the management of common mental health disorders in the community, in particular depression. The identification of predictors of depression in the community is important to identify the target population for the program."
https://openalex.org/W2052714451,"We have previously reported that leiomyoma expressed lower levels of miR-200c and elevated IL8 as compared to paired myometrium. Here we addressed the regulatory functions of miR-200c on the expression of inflammatory mediators and cellular viability using leiomyomas and paired myometrium and their isolated primary smooth muscle cells. Our results indicated that gain-of function or knockdown of miR-200c in leiomyoma smooth muscle cells (LSMC) regulated IL8 mRNA and protein expression through direct targeting of IKBKB and alteration of NF-kB activity. Additionally, leiomyoma expressed higher levels of phosphorylated IKBKB with no significant difference in the level of IKBKB mRNA and protein as compared to matched myometrium. Gain-of function of miR-200c in LSMC resulted in decreased IkBαphosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation, which led to decreased p65 transcriptional activity of IL8 promoter, and increased caspase 3/7 activity which was not reversible following IL8 restoration. Collectively, our results suggest that NF-κB signaling pathway is a target of miR-200c regulatory function, and low level of miR-200c expression in leiomyoma by transcriptional regulation of inflammatory mediators such as IL8, in part account for development of leiomyomas."
https://openalex.org/W1964575804,"DDB2 exhibits a high affinity toward UV-damaged DNA, and it is involved in the initial steps of global genome nucleotide excision repair. Mutations in the DDB2 gene cause the genetic complementation group E of xeroderma pigmentosum, an autosomal recessive disease manifested clinically by hypersensitivity to sunlight exposure and an increased predisposition to skin cancer. Here we found that, in human cells, the initiating methionine residue in DDB2 was removed and that the N-terminal alanine could be methylated on its α-amino group in human cells, with trimethylation being the major form. We also demonstrated that the α-N-methylation of DDB2 is catalyzed by the N-terminal RCC1 methyltransferase. In addition, a methylation-defective mutant of DDB2 displayed diminished nuclear localization and was recruited at a reduced efficiency to UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer foci. Moreover, loss of this methylation conferred compromised ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) activation, decreased efficiency in cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer repair, and elevated sensitivity of cells toward UV light exposure. Our study provides new knowledge about the posttranslational regulation of DDB2 and expands the biological functions of protein α-N-methylation to DNA repair."

Here, we make multifaceted approaches to characterize F77 antigen, including binding analyses with the glycolipid extract of the prostate cancer cell line PC3, microarrays with sequence-defined glycan probes, and designer arrays from the O-glycome of an antigen-positive mucin, in conjunction with mass spectrometry. Our results reveal F77 antigen to be expressed on blood group H on a 6-linked branch of a poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone. We show that mAb F77 can also bind to blood group A and B analogs but with lower intensities. We propose that the close association of F77 antigen with prostate cancers is a consequence of increased blood group H expression together with up-regulated branching enzymes. This is in contrast to other epithelial cancers that have up-regulated branching enzymes but diminished expression of H antigen. With knowledge of the structure and prevalence of F77 antigen in prostate cancer, the way is open to explore rationally its application as a biomarker to detect F77-positive circulating prostate cancer-derived glycoproteins and tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068066264,"Eya proteins are essential co-activators of the Six family of transcription factors and contain a unique tyrosine phosphatase domain belonging to the haloacid dehalogenase family of phosphatases. The phosphatase activity of Eya is important for the transcription of a subset of Six1-target genes, and also directs cells to the repair rather than apoptosis pathway upon DNA damage. Furthermore, Eya phosphatase activity has been shown to mediate transformation, invasion, migration, and metastasis of breast cancer cells, making it a potential new drug target for breast cancer. We have previously identified a class of N-arylidenebenzohydrazide compounds that specifically inhibit the Eya2 phosphatase. Herein, we demonstrate that these compounds are reversible inhibitors that selectively inhibit the phosphatase activity of Eya2, but not Eya3. Our mutagenesis results suggest that this class of compounds does not bind to the active site and the binding does not require the coordination with Mg(2+). Moreover, these compounds likely bind within a site on the opposite face of the active site, and function as allosteric inhibitors. We also demonstrate that this class of compounds inhibits Eya2 phosphatase-mediated cell migration, setting the foundation for these molecules to be developed into chemical probes for understanding the specific function of the Eya2 phosphatase and to serve as a prototype for the development of Eya2 phosphatase specific anti-cancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1964572538,"The lack of a few conserved enzymes in the classical mevalonate pathway and the widespread existence of isopentenyl phosphate kinase suggest the presence of a partly modified mevalonate pathway in most archaea and in some bacteria. In the pathway, (R)-mevalonate 5-phosphate is thought to be metabolized to isopentenyl diphosphate via isopentenyl phosphate. The long anticipated enzyme that catalyzes the reaction from (R)-mevalonate 5-phosphate to isopentenyl phosphate was recently identified in a Cloroflexi bacterium, Roseiflexus castenholzii, and in a halophilic archaeon, Haloferax volcanii. However, our trial to convert the intermediates of the classical and modified mevalonate pathways into isopentenyl diphosphate using cell-free extract from a thermophilic archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum implied that the branch point intermediate of these known pathways, i.e. (R)-mevalonate 5-phosphate, is unlikely to be the precursor of isoprenoid. Through the process of characterizing the recombinant homologs of mevalonate pathway-related enzymes from the archaeon, a distant homolog of diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase was found to catalyze the phosphorylation of (R)-mevalonate to yield (R)-mevalonate 3-phosphate. The product could be converted into isopentenyl phosphate, probably through (R)-mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate, by the action of unidentified T. acidophilum enzymes fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography. These findings demonstrate the presence of a third alternative ""Thermoplasma-type"" mevalonate pathway, which involves (R)-mevalonate 3-phosphotransferase and probably both (R)-mevalonate 3-phosphate 5-phosphotransferase and (R)-mevalonate 3,5-bisphosphate decarboxylase, in addition to isopentenyl phosphate kinase."

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a causative agent of pneumonia and meningitis, and the appearance of drug-resistance organisms has made its treatment challenging, especially in developing countries. Pneumococcus-expressed pili are composed of three structural proteins: RrgB, which forms the polymerized backbone, RrgA, the tip-associated adhesin, and RrgC, which presumably associates the pilus with the bacterial cell wall. Despite the fact that the structures of both RrgA and RrgB were known previously, structural information for RrgC was still lacking, impeding the analysis of a complete model of pilus architecture. Here, we report the structure of RrgC to 1.85 Å and reveal that it is a three-domain molecule stabilized by two intradomain isopeptide bonds. RrgC does not depend on pilus-specific sortases to become attached to the cell wall; instead, it binds the preformed pilus to the peptidoglycan by employing the catalytic activity of SrtA. A comprehensive model of the type 1 pilus from S. pneumoniae is also presented."

There were 383 EPTB patients (9% of all TB cases) with a mean age of 35 years, male/female ratio of 1.3 and important regional variation. There were significantly more females (p = 0.001), children <15 years (p<0.001) and HIV-positive patients (p = 0.005) with EPTB compared with NPTB. Pleural effusion, spinal and lymph node tuberculosis accounted for 66% of all EPTB. Children <15 years represented 16% of cases, with lymph node disease being most common among them (p<0.001). Of 130 EPTB patients registered in CNHP-P, 7% had a confirmed bacteriological/histological diagnosis. There were 331 (86%) patients who successfully completed treatment. More patients with EPTB were lost-to-follow-up compared with NPTB (p<0.001) with all these patients from one region. The best treatment completion rates were in children <15 years (OR:3.5, 95%CI:1.0-14.8) while patients with pleural effusion and ascites had the worst outcomes. Of 72 HIV-coinfected patients, 88% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). HIV-positive status was associated with poor outcomes while those on ART fared better. In the CNHP-P, more than 80% who completed their treatment showed an increase in bodyweight and this was more evident in HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative patients (p = 0.03).Patients with EPTB generally do well in Bénin, although the TB Programme would benefit through more attention to accurate diagnosis and earlier start of ART in HIV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2117901472,"Differentiation is an inseparable process of development in multicellular organisms. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) represent a valuable research tool to conduct in vitro studies of cell differentiation. Apoptosis as a well known cell death mechanism shows some common features with cell differentiation, which has caused a number of ambiguities in the field. The research question here is how cells could differentiate these two processes from each other. We have investigated the role of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and cell energy level during differentiation of mESCs into the cardiomyocytes and their apoptosis. p53 expression, cytochrome c release, apoptosome formation, and caspase-3/7 activation are observed upon induction of both apoptosis and differentiation. However, remarkable differences are detected in time of cytochrome c appearance, apoptosome formation, and caspase activity upon induction of both processes. In apoptosis, apoptosome formation and caspase activity were observed rapidly following the cytochrome c release. Unlike apoptosis, the release of cytochrome c upon differentiation took more time, and the maximum caspase activity was also postponed for 24 h. This delay suggests that there is a regulatory mechanism during differentiation of mESCs into cardiomyocytes. The highest ATP content of cells was observed immediately after cytochrome c release 6 h after apoptosis induction and then decreased, but it was gradually increased up to 48 h after differentiation. These observations suggest that a delay in the release of cytochrome c or delay in ATP increase attenuate apoptosome formation, and caspase activation thereby discriminates apoptosis from differentiation in mESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2074780044,"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease accompanied by alveolar bone resorption by osteoclasts. Porphyromonas gingivalis, an etiological agent for periodontitis, produces cysteine proteases called gingipains, which are classified based on their cleavage site specificity (i.e. arginine (Rgps) and lysine (Kgps) gingipains). We previously reported that Kgp degraded osteoprotegerin (OPG), an osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor secreted by osteoblasts, and enhanced osteoclastogenesis induced by various Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (Yasuhara, R., Miyamoto, Y., Takami, M., Imamura, T., Potempa, J., Yoshimura, K., and Kamijo, R. (2009) Lysine-specific gingipain promotes lipopolysaccharide- and active-vitamin D3-induced osteoclast differentiation by degrading osteoprotegerin. Biochem. J. 419, 159-166). Osteoclastogenesis is induced not only by TLR ligands but also by proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-17A, in inflammatory conditions, such as periodontitis. Although Kgp augmented osteoclastogenesis induced by TNF-α and IL-1β in co-cultures of mouse osteoblasts and bone marrow cells, it suppressed that induced by IL-17A. In a comparison of proteolytic degradation of these cytokines by Kgp in a cell-free system with that of OPG, TNF-α and IL-1β were less susceptible, whereas IL-17A and OPG were equally susceptible to degradation by Kgp. These results indicate that the enhancing effect of Kgp on cytokine-induced osteoclastogenesis is dependent on the difference in degradation efficiency between each cytokine and OPG. In addition, elucidation of the N-terminal amino acid sequences of OPG fragments revealed that Kgp primarily cleaved OPG in its death domain homologous region, which might prevent dimer formation of OPG required for inhibition of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand. Collectively, our results suggest that degradation of OPG by Kgp is a crucial event in the development of osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in periodontitis."

Benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA) is an unprecedented example of a highly selective positive allosteric modulator of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). However, despite favorable pharmacological characteristics of BQCA in vitro and in vivo, there is limited evidence of the impact of allosteric modulation on receptor regulatory mechanisms such as β-arrestin recruitment or receptor internalization and endocytic trafficking. In the present study we investigated the impact of BQCA on M1 mAChR regulation. We show that BQCA potentiates agonist-induced β-arrestin recruitment to M1 mAChRs. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer approach to monitor intracellular trafficking of M1 mAChRs, we show that once internalized, M1 mAChRs traffic to early endosomes, recycling endosomes and late endosomes. We also show that BQCA potentiates agonist-induced subcellular trafficking. M1 mAChR internalization is both β-arrestin and G protein-dependent, with the third intracellular loop playing an important role in the dynamics of β-arrestin recruitment. As the global effect of receptor activation ultimately depends on the levels of receptor expression at the cell surface, these results illustrate the need to extend the characterization of novel allosteric modulators of G protein-coupled receptors to encapsulate the consequences of chronic exposure to this family of ligands.

However, despite favorable pharmacological characteristics of BQCA in vitro and in vivo, there is limited evidence of the impact of allosteric modulation on receptor regulatory mechanisms such as β-arrestin recruitment or receptor internalization and endocytic trafficking. In the present study we investigated the impact of BQCA on M1 mAChR regulation. We show that BQCA potentiates agonist-induced β-arrestin recruitment to M1 mAChRs. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer approach to monitor intracellular trafficking of M1 mAChRs, we show that once internalized, M1 mAChRs traffic to early endosomes, recycling endosomes and late endosomes. We also show that BQCA potentiates agonist-induced subcellular trafficking. M1 mAChR internalization is both β-arrestin and G protein-dependent, with the third intracellular loop playing an important role in the dynamics of β-arrestin recruitment. As the global effect of receptor activation ultimately depends on the levels of receptor expression at the cell surface, these results illustrate the need to extend the characterization of novel allosteric modulators of G protein-coupled receptors to encapsulate the consequences of chronic exposure to this family of ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2070559441,"Background The canonical Wnt signaling pathway plays important roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation, axonal outgrowth, cellular maintenance in retinas. Here we test the hypothesis that elements of the Wnt signaling pathway are involved in the regulation of eye growth and prevention of myopia, in the mouse form-deprivation myopia model. Methodology/Principal Findings (1) One hundred twenty-five C57BL/6 mice were randomly distributed into form-deprivation myopia and control groups. Form-deprivation myopia (FDM) was induced by suturing the right eyelid, while the control group received no treatment. After 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment, eyes were assessed in vivo by cycloplegic retinoscopic refraction and axial length measurement by photography or A-scan ultrasonography. Levels of retinal Wnt2b, Fzd5 and β-catenin mRNA and protein were evaluated using RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. (2) Another 96 mice were divided into three groups: control, drugs-only, and drugs+FDM (by diffuser). Experimentally treated eyes in the last two groups received intravitreal injections of vehicle or the proteins, DKK-1 (Wnt-pathway antagonist) or Norrin (Wnt-pathway agonist), once every three days, for 4 injections total. Axial length and retinoscopic refraction were measured on the 14th day of form deprivation. Following form-deprivation for 1, 2, and 4 weeks, FDM eyes had a relatively myopic refractive error, compared with contralateral eyes. There were no significant differences in refractive error between right and left eye in control group. The amounts of Wnt2b, Fzd5 and β-catenin mRNA and protein were significantly greater in form-deprived myopia eyes than in control eyes.DKK-1 (antagonist) reduced the myopic shift in refractive error and increase in axial elongation, whereas Norrin had the opposite effect in FDM eyes. Conclusions/Significance Our studies provide the first evidence that the Wnt2b signaling pathway may play a role in the development and progression of form-deprivation myopia, in a mammalian model."
https://openalex.org/W2105272991,"Steroid hormone receptors are ligand-dependent transcription factors that require the ordered assembly of multichaperone complexes for transcriptional activity. Although heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 and Hsp70 are key players in this process, multiple Hsp70- and Hsp90-associated cochaperones associate with receptor-chaperone complexes to regulate receptor folding and activation. Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha (SGTA) was recently characterized as an Hsp70 and Hsp90-associated cochaperone that specifically regulates androgen receptor activity. However, the specificity of SGTA for additional members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily and the mechanism by which SGTA regulates receptor activity remain unclear. Here we report that SGTA associates with and specifically regulates the androgen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors and has no effect on the mineralocorticoid and estrogen receptors in both yeast and mammalian cell-based reporter assays. In both systems, SGTA knockdown/deletion enhances receptor activity, whereas SGTA overexpression suppresses receptor activity. We demonstrate that SGTA binds directly to Hsp70 and Hsp90 in vitro with similar affinities yet predominately precipitates with Hsp70 from cell lysates, suggesting a role for SGTA in early, Hsp70-mediated folding. Furthermore, SGTA expression completely abrogates the regulation of receptor function by FKBP52 (52-kDa FK506-binding protein), which acts at a later stage of the chaperone cycle. Taken together, our data suggest a role for SGTA at distinct steps in the chaperone-dependent modulation of androgen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2032241863,"Rabies pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have great potential in gene therapy, not least because of their ability to transduce neurons following their distal axonal application. However, very little is known about the molecular processes that underlie their retrograde transport and cell transduction. Using multiple labeling techniques and confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that pseudotyping with rabies virus envelope glycoprotein (RV-G) enabled the axonal retrograde transport of two distinct subtypes of lentiviral vector in motor neuron cultures. Analysis of this process revealed that these vectors trafficked through Rab5-positive endosomes and accumulated within a non-acidic Rab7 compartment. RV-G pseudotyped vectors were co-transported with both the tetanus neurotoxin-binding fragment and the membrane proteins thought to mediate rabies virus endocytosis (neural cell adhesion molecule, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and p75 neurotrophin receptor), thus demonstrating that pseudotyping with RV-G targets lentiviral vectors for transport along the same pathway exploited by several toxins and viruses. Using motor neurons cultured in compartmentalized chambers, we demonstrated that axonal retrograde transport of these vectors was rapid and efficient; however, it was not able to transduce the targeted neurons efficiently, suggesting that impairment in processes occurring after arrival of the viral vector in the soma is responsible for the low transduction efficiency seen in vivo, which suggests a novel area for improvement of gene therapy vectors.

Lentivirus-mediated delivery is a highly promising technique for gene therapy showing significant advantages over other viral delivery vectors by their ability to effectively transduce non-dividing cells such as neurons (1Wong L.-F. Goodhead L. Prat C. Mitrophanous K.A. Kingsman S.M. Mazarakis N.D. Lentivirus-mediated gene transfer to the central nervous system: therapeutic and research applications.Hum.

J. 2012; 443: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). An additional advantage is represented by the possibility to utilize heterologous envelope glycoproteins to pseudotype these vectors, thus broadening their tropism (3Cronin J. Zhang X.-Y. Reiser J. Altering the tropism of lentiviral vectors through pseudotyping.Curr. Gene Ther. 2005; 5: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Among the first and most widely used envelope glycoproteins for pseudotyping lentiviral vectors is the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G). 5The abbreviations used are:VSV-Gvesicular stomatitis virus glycoproteinRV-Grabies virus envelope glycoproteinp75NTRp75 neurotrophin receptorNCAMneural cell adhesion moleculenAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptorHIV-1human immunodeficiency virus, type 1TeNTtetanus neurotoxinEIAVequine infectious anemia viruseGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinFlAsHfluorescein arsenical hairpin binderPFAparaformaldehydem.o.i.multiplicity of infectionINintegraseMFCmicrofluidic chamberDIVdays in vitroHcbinding fragment of TeNT. Because of their high transduction efficiency, wide cell tropism, and stability, VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus vectors are considered the gold standard for the field. Their broad tropism, however, diminishes their usefulness for gene targeting to specific disease sites. In addition, they lack the ability to access the central nervous system (CNS) without invasive delivery methods. vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein rabies virus envelope glycoprotein p75 neurotrophin receptor neural cell adhesion molecule nicotinic acetylcholine receptor human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 tetanus neurotoxin equine infectious anemia virus enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescein arsenical hairpin binder paraformaldehyde multiplicity of infection integrase microfluidic chamber days in vitro binding fragment of TeNT. Pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with the rabies virus envelope glycoprotein (RV-G) makes them neurotropic and more importantly confers upon them the ability to retrogradely traffic along axons to neuronal soma (4Mazarakis N.D. Azzouz M. Rohll J.B. Ellard F.M. Wilkes F.J. Olsen A.L. Carter E.E. Barber R.D. Baban D.F. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. O'Malley K. Mitrophanous K.A.

Genet. 2001; 10: 2109-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Furthermore, peripheral administration of RV-G lentiviral vectors to the rat gastrocnemius muscle leads to gene transfer in motor neurons of the lumbar spinal cord (4Mazarakis N.D. Azzouz M. Rohll J.B. Ellard F.M. Wilkes F.J. Olsen A.L. Carter E.E. Barber R.D. Baban D.F. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. O'Malley K. Mitrophanous K.A.

The specific targeting of neuronal cells with the RV-G pseudotype opens up the possibility of non-invasive, distal administration of the vector at the neuromuscular synapses to target cells of the CNS affected by motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy. In this respect, lentiviral delivery of transgenes or RNAi using such vectors has been shown to be effective in ameliorating symptoms in murine models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy (5Azzouz M. Le T. Ralph G.S. Walmsley L. Monani U.R. Lee D.C. Wilkes F. Mitrophanous K.A. Kingsman S.M. Burghes A.H. Mazarakis N.D.

Silencing mutant SOD1 using RNAi protects against neurodegeneration and extends survival in an ALS model.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Despite the clear advantages of this system for gene therapy, a number of improvements are still required before pursuing clinical trials. One established strategy for improving the efficiency of transduction is the manipulation of the viral envelope, a process known as surface engineering (7Verhoeyen E. Cosset F.-L. Surface-engineering of lentiviral vectors.J. Gene Med. 2004; 6: S83-S94Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, a more general approach is the identification of the molecular processes involved in retrograde viral transduction to identify the exact limitations of this therapeutic vehicle. Currently, no detailed study on lentiviral vector trafficking has been attempted. Rhabdoviruses such as rabies virus and VSV enter cells using a well studied mechanism (8Oksayan S. Ito N. Moseley G. Blondel D. Subcellular trafficking in rhabdovirus infection and immune evasion: a novel target for therapeutics.Infect. Disord. Drug Targets. 2012; 12: 38-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Following binding to a cell surface molecule (p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) for RV), virus particles undergo clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Following uptake, clathrin-coated vesicles become associated with the small GTPase Rab5, and their lumen undergoes acidification. “Endosomal maturation” promotes an increased association with Rab7 (rather than Rab5) and is accompanied by a further decrease in pH before the endosome finally fuses with the lysosome (9Miaczynska M. Zerial M. Mosaic organization of the endocytic pathway.Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Rab conversion as a mechanism of progression from early to late endosomes.Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Importantly, the viral particles “escape” from the endosomal lumen before fusion with the lysosome, a process that is triggered by acidification (11Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W. Knossow M.

This acidic environment induces a conformational change in the viral glycoprotein that initiates membrane fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane, allowing escape of the viral capsid. In wild-type rabies virus, the capsid then enters the cytosol, a process enhanced by an interaction of the capsid with the cytoplasmic dynein motor complex, which promotes transport toward the soma (13Rasalingam P. Rossiter J.P. Mebatsion T. Jackson A.C.

Cell. 2007; 18: 3204-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a process that can occur even from distal axonal sites. In addition, transport of enveloped rabies virus in neuronal transport vesicles has been demonstrated in vitro (16Klingen Y. Conzelmann K.K. Finke S. Double-labelled rabies virus: live tracking of enveloped virus transport.J. Virol. 2008; 82: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Previous experiments have studied the trafficking of labeled HIV-1 and demonstrated that HIV-1 capsids are also able to undergo dynein-mediated trafficking to the nucleus (17Dodding M.P. Way M. Coupling viruses to dynein and kinesin-1.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3527-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 18McDonald D. Vodicka M.A. Lucero G. Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Emerman M. Hope T.J. Visualization of the intracellular behavior of HIV in living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar); however, because native HIV-1 is unable to infect neurons (for a review, see Ref. 19Kovalevich J. Langford D. Neuronal toxicity in HIV CNS disease.Future Virol. 2012; 7: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is currently unclear whether these capsids can reach the nucleus from such distal sites as the neuromuscular junction. Recent work has characterized an axon-specific membrane trafficking pathway (20Salinas S. Bilsland L.G. Schiavo G.

Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This axonal trafficking pathway, shared by neurotrophins in the CNS (29Butowt R. von Bartheld C.S.

Neurosci. 2003; 17: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), utilizes a population of endosomes undergoing a sequential Rab5 and Rab7 transition. In contrast to the canonical pathway, however, this maturation is not accompanied by a decrease in the luminal pH, which remains neutral. Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that two of the reported receptors for RV-G (p75NTR and NCAM) undergo retrograde axonal transport in these Rab7-positive non-acidified endosomes (23Deinhardt K. Salinas S. Verastegui C. Watson R. Worth D. Hanrahan S. Bucci C. Schiavo G.

Neurochem. 2012; 121: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a potential route of delivery for both wild-type rabies virus and RV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors that would allow the vector to reach the nucleus without pH-driven endosomal fusion. Here, we investigated the endocytic trafficking of RV-G pseudotyped vectors in motor neurons. Utilizing a number of distinct labeling techniques, we showed that these vectors did indeed undergo axonal retrograde transport in primary motor neurons. We further demonstrated that this transport was achieved through sequential Rab5- and Rab7-positive organelles also used for the long range transport of p75NTR, and the nAChR was also targeted to the same retrograde trafficking pathway. We further managed to recapitulate retrograde transport in primary motor neurons cultured in microfluidic chambers but failed to detect robust transduction under similar conditions. Use of this in vitro system, which parallels the in vivo intramuscular injection route, strongly suggests that the major block to efficient viral vector transduction is at a stage following axonal transport perhaps between endosomal escape and nuclear transport of the vector capsid. HEK293T cells were from ATCC UK and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and 1% l-glutamine (Sigma). The NSC-34 mouse neuroblastoma cell line was a gift from Pam Shaw (University of Sheffield, UK) and was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% essential amino acids (Sigma), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and routinely passaged every 72–96 h.

To produce a C-terminal fusion of the integrase gene product of the HIV-1 pol gene, PCR was used to remove the stop codon at the 3′-end of the pol gene in pMD2-LgpRRE and insert an XbaI site. The resulting product was digested with AflII and BspEI and used to replace the corresponding sequence in the pMD2-LgpRRE vector. PCR was then used to amplify the coding sequence of the eGFP of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), and this sequence was then ligated in-frame between the new XbaI and BspEI sites. Tetracysteine (Cys4)-tagged gag constructs were made by splicing by overhang extension (31Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

These were used as both the template for PCR cloning and the final destination vector for the construct. The region containing the ClaI-BclI fragment of pMD-LgpRRE and SacII/AscI-XbaI fragment of pEV53B was amplified by PCR to generate gag-Cys4 fragments that were cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) by TOPO cloning. Following restriction enzyme digests and sequence analysis to identify clones with correct inserts, the gag-Cys4 fragments were subcloned into their respective pMD2-LgpRRE and pEV53B vectors. HIV-based lentiviral vectors were produced using a four-vector system as described previously (33Trabalza A. Georgiadis C. Eleftheriadou I. Hislop J.N. Ellison S.M. Karavassilis M.E. Mazarakis N.D.

Briefly, HEK293T cells were plated in 3 × 150-mm dishes at a density of 1.4 × 106 cells/plate. 24 h later each plate was transfected with 15 μg of pLV-LacZ (Addgene) or Sin-cPPT-PGK-eGFP-WHV obtained from Professor Mimoun Azzouz (University of Sheffield, UK), 15 μg of HIV-1 GagPol (pMD2-LgpRRE, pMD2-Lgp(4C-MAC)RRE, or pMD2-LgpRRE-IN-GFP), 3 μg of HIV-1 Rev (pRSV-Rev obtained from Professor James Uney, University of Bristol, UK), and 5.1 μg of the envelope plasmid (pMD2-VSVg or pMD2-B2C) using calcium phosphate precipitation. 16 h post-transfection the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine, and 10 mm sodium butyrate. Medium was harvested 36 h later, and virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 87,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C through a 20% sucrose cushion (34Carpentier D.C. Vevis K. Trabalza A. Georgiadis C.

The viral pellet was then resuspended in 50 μl of TSSM buffer (20 mm tromethamine, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mg ml−1 sucrose, 10 mg ml−1 mannitol). To label the particles with lipophilic dye (Vybrant DiO or DiD, Invitrogen), an additional step was added. 16 h post-transfection medium was replaced with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 3.7 μm Vybrant dye and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h before replacing with medium containing sodium butyrate as above. For FlAsH labeling, at the time of sodium butyrate induction, 1 μm FlAsH-EDT2 (Invitrogen) was added to the low serum medium premixed with 12.5 μm 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT; Sigma-Aldrich), and virus production was continued for a further 36 h. Free biarsenical dye, not incorporated into vectors, was removed by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion as described above. For the Cys4-tagged EIAV vectors, each plate was transfected with 22.5 μg of EIAV GagPol (pEV53B or pEV53B Cys4-MA-C), 22.5 μg of SIN6.1CZW-LacZ or 6.1CeGFPW, and 13.5 μg of pMD2-B2C.

For vector expressing the LacZ gene, HEK293T cells were plated in a 12-well plate at 300,000 cells/well. 24 h later cells were transduced with vector (plus 8 μg/ml Polybrene). 48 h post-transduction cells were washed and fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA), and LacZ expression was detected using the β-Gal Staining kit (Invitrogen, K1465-01). Positive cells were then manually counted to determine the number of LacZ-forming units (LfU)/ml. Primary motor neurons were obtained and cultured as described previously (33Trabalza A. Georgiadis C.

Briefly, all cells were plated onto culture vessels treated with 5 μg/ml poly-l-ornithine and 3 μg/ml laminin. Cells were plated in 8-well chamber slides and for live imaging were plated in glass-bottomed dishes (Mattek). Ventral spinal cords were removed from E14 embryos and placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.025% trypsin (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. After digestion, 100 μl of DNase (Invitrogen; 1 mg/ml in L-15 medium), 100 μl of BSA fraction V (Sigma-Aldrich; 4% in L-15 medium), and 800 μl of L-15 medium were added to the tube, and clumps were mechanically dissociated. Cells were then centrifuged through a BSA cushion followed by further purification based on the relative large size of motor neurons and subsequent flotation on an Optiprep gradient. All animal procedures were approved by the local Ethics Committee and performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986) and associated guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and the suffering. The animals were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle (light phase, 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) with food and water available ad libitum. Animals were supplied by Charles River, UK. Timed pregnant female Wistar rats on the 14th day of pregnancy (E14) were used in the experiment. Animals were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg sodium pentobarbitone, and the embryos were immediately removed and kept in modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free; Sigma-Aldrich). Small incisions in the right hind limb were performed to expose the gastrocnemius muscle. Concentrated RV-G pseudotyped lentiviral (10 μl of 1.66 × 109 transducing units/ml) eGFP-expressing vector and Fast Blue (3 μl of 2% solution in water) were intramuscularly injected unilaterally in right gastrocnemius muscle of C57BL/6 mice (n = 6) via two injections (lentiviral vector) or a single injection (Fast Blue) with a 26-gauge hypodermic needle connected to a microinjection pump (UltraMicroPump III and Micro4 Controller, World Precision Instruments) at a rate of 1 μg/μl. Three weeks or 8 days postinjection of lentiviral vector or Fast Blue, respectively, mice were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg sodium pentobarbitone and transcardially perfused with 10 ml of saline (0.9% (w/v) NaCl) plus heparin followed by 100 ml of 4% (w/v) PFA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Spinal cords were removed and postfixed for 4 h in 4% PFA followed by cryoprotection in 10% glycerol and 20% sucrose in PBS for at least 72 h. Tissues were subsequently embedded and frozen in OCT (Surgipath FSC22, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The lumbar segments of spinal cords were cut at 50 μm using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems). Sections were then mounted on gelatinized slides and stored at −20 °C. Spinal cord sections form Fast Blue-injected mice were imaged directly. Sections from RV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vector-injected mice underwent a further staining step to enhance the signal. Immunohistochemistry was performed on slide-mounted spinal cord sections. Tissue was permeabilized for 1 h with PBS containing 10% donkey serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Antibody to eGFP (ab290, Abcam; 1:500) was diluted in the same buffer and placed on sections overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then blocked for 30 min prior to incubating for 3 h at room tem; 1:400). Sections were coverslipped with ProLong antifade aqueous mounting medium (Invitrogen) containing DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:2,000). Immunostained and Fast Blue-containing sections were imaged using a Leica SP5 II confocal microscope and processed using ImageJ software. Neurons were treated as described in figure legends, fixed in 4% PFA, and then quenched in PBS with 100 mm glycine before permeabilization in PBS plus 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 and addition of primary antibodies. Staining was visualized using Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Cells were then imaged using a Leica SP5 II confocal microscope and processed using ImageJ, and images were enhanced using a 1.0-pixel median filter and brightness/contrast and then rendered and pseudocolored using Adobe Photoshop. Colocalization of signals was quantified as reported previously (23Deinhardt K. Salinas S. Verastegui C. Watson R. Worth D. Hanrahan S. Bucci C. Schiavo G.

https://openalex.org/W2076289737,"This study reports the determination of the carbohydrate epitope of monoclonal antibody F77 previously raised against human prostate cancer PC-3 cells (Zhang, G., Zhang, H., Wang, Q., Lal, P., Carroll, A. M., de la Llera-Moya, M., Xu, X., and Greene, M. I. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 107, 732-737). We performed a series of co-transfections using mammalian expression vectors encoding specific glycosyltransferases. We thereby identified branching enzymes and FUT1 (required for Fucα1→2Gal linkage) as being essential for F77 antigen formation. When immortalized normal prostate 267B1 cells were transfected with FUT1 alone, cells showed weak expression of F77 antigen. By contrast, cells co-transfected with FUT1 plus either GCNT1, GCNT2, or GCNT3 (an enzyme required to form GlcNAcβ1→6Gal/GalNAc) showed robust F77 antigen expression, suggesting that F77 specifically binds to Fucα1→2Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Gal/GalNAc. RT-PCR for FUT1, GCNT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 showed that F77-positive cell lines indeed express transcripts encoding FUT1 plus one GCNT. F77-positive prostate cancer cells transfected with siRNAs targeting FUT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 showed significantly reduced F77 antigen, confirming the requirement of these enzymes for epitope synthesis. We also found that hypoxia induces F77 epitope expression in immortalized prostate RWPE1 cells, which express F77 antigen moderately under normoxia but at an elevated level under hypoxia. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated up-regulation of FUT1, GCNT2, and GCNT3 transcripts in RWPE1 cells under hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia up-regulates glycosyltransferase expression required for F77 antigen synthesis. These results define the F77 epitope and provide a potential mechanism for F77 antigen synthesis in malignant prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1969551124,"Introduction Hemodialysis (HD) and hemodiafiltration clear only with a low efficiency the plasma from interleukin-6 and p-cresol, two protein-bound uremic toxins associated with high cardiovascular risk in end stage renal disease. HFR Supra is a double-chamber hemodiafiltration system in which the ultrafiltrate returns to the patient after its regeneration through a resin cartridge that binds hydrophobic and protein-bound solutes. In the present study, we evaluated whether the HFR cartridge can also bind total p-cresol and IL-6 and remove them from the ultrafiltrate. Methods We compared the levels of IL-6 and p-cresol in ultrafiltrate samples collected at the inlet (UFin) and at the outlet (UFout) of the cartridge at the start or at the end of a 240 min HFR session in 12 inflamed chronic HD patients. The pro-inflammatory activity of the ultrafiltrate samples was also determined by evaluating the changes that they induced in IL-6 mRNA expression and protein release in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 12 healthy volunteers. IL-6 and p-cresol circulating levels were also assessed in peripheral plasma blood samples collected before and after HFR and, for comparison, a control HD. Results p-Cresol and IL-6 were lower in UFout than in UFin both at the start and at the end of the HFR session, suggesting that they were retained by the cartridge. IL-6 mRNA expression and release were lower in PBMC incubated with UFout collected at the end than with UFin collected at the start of HFR, suggesting that passage through the cartridge reduced UF pro-inflammatory activity. Plasma total p-cresol decreased by about 53% after HFR, and 37% after HD. IL-6 circulating values were unmodified by either these dialysis procedures. Conclusions This study shows that the HFR-Supra cartridge retains total p-cresol and IL-6 in the ultrafiltrate and lowers plasma total p cresol but not IL-6 levels.

https://openalex.org/W2157468763,"GNA2091 of Neisseria meningitidis is a lipoprotein of unknown function that is included in the novel 4CMenB vaccine. Here, we investigated the biological function and the subcellular localization of the protein. We demonstrate that GNA2091 functions in the assembly of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) because its absence resulted in the accumulation of misassembled OMPs. Cell fractionation and protease accessibility experiments showed that the protein is localized at the periplasmic side of the outer membrane. Pulldown experiments revealed that it is not stably associated with the β-barrel assembly machinery, the previously identified complex for OMP assembly. Thus, GNA2091 constitutes a novel outer membrane-based lipoprotein required for OMP assembly. Furthermore, its location at the inner side of the outer membrane indicates that protective immunity elicited by this antigen cannot be due to bactericidal or opsonic activity of antibodies."

The aim of this study was a hypothesis-free microarray analysis of the transcriptional changes within cerebellar specimens of five cases of acute, six cases of subacute demyelinating, and three cases of chronic demyelinating and inflammatory CDV leukoencephalitis as compared to twelve non-infected control dogs. Frozen cerebellar specimens were used for analysis of histopathological changes including demyelination, transcriptional changes employing microarrays, and presence of CDV nucleoprotein RNA and protein using microarrays, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Microarray analysis revealed 780 differentially expressed probe sets. The dominating change was an up-regulation of genes related to the innate and the humoral immune response, and less distinct the cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immune response in all subtypes of CDV leukoencephalitis as compared to controls. Multiple myelin genes including myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein displayed a selective down-regulation in subacute CDV leukoencephalitis, suggestive of an oligodendrocyte dystrophy. In contrast, a marked up-regulation of multiple immunoglobulin-like expressed sequence tags and the delta polypeptide of the CD3 antigen was observed in chronic CDV leukoencephalitis, in agreement with the hypothesis of an immune-mediated demyelination in the late inflammatory phase of the disease. Analysis of pathways intimately linked to demyelination as determined by morphometry employing correlation-based Gene Set Enrichment Analysis highlighted the pathomechanistic importance of up-regulated genes comprised by the gene ontology terms “viral replication” and “humoral immune response” as well as down-regulated genes functionally related to “metabolite and energy generation”."

Sera were screened for Rickettsia rickettsii Abs by indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA), and those with positive results were further examined for Abs against R. rickettsii, R. typhi, R. felis, R. conorii, and R. japonica using micro-immunofluorescence (MIF) tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of SFGR DNA was applied in those indicated acute infections. Case geographic distribution was made by the geographic information system software.A total of 413 cases with paired serum, including 90 cases of Q fever, 47 cases of scrub typhus, 12 cases of murine typhus, 6 cases of leptospirosis, 3 cases of dengue fever, and 255 cases of unknown febrile diseases were investigated. Using IFA tests, a total of 49 cases with 47 (11.4%) and 4 (1.0%) cases had sera potentially positive for R. rickettsii IgG and IgM, respectively. In the 49 cases screened from IFA, MIF tests revealed that there were 5 cases of acute infections (3 possible R. felis and 2 undetermined SFGR) and 13 cases of past infections (3 possible R. felis and 10 undetermined SFGR). None of the 5 cases of acute infection had detectable SFGR DNA in the blood specimen by PCR. Possible acute infection of R. felis was identified in both one case of Q fever and scrub typhus. The geographic distribution of SFGR cases is similar with that of scrub typhus.Human SFGR exist and are neglected diseases in southern Taiwan, particularly for the species closely-related to R. felis."
https://openalex.org/W2027922466,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib can effectively target the BCR-ABL oncoprotein in a majority of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Unfortunately, some patients are resistant primarily to imatinib and others develop drug resistance, prompting interest in the discovery of new drug targets. Although much of this resistance can be explained by the presence of mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain of BCR-ABL, such mutations are not universally identified. Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8) is a transcription factor that is essential for myelopoiesis. Depressed IRF-8 levels are observed in a majority of CML patients and Irf-8(-/-) mice exhibit a CML-like disease. The underlying mechanisms of IRF-8 loss in CML are unknown. We hypothesized that BCR-ABL suppresses transcription of IRF-8 through STAT5, a proximal BCR-ABL target. Treatment of primary cells from newly diagnosed CML patients in chronic phase as well as BCR-ABL(+) cell lines with imatinib increased IRF-8 transcription. Furthermore, IRF-8 expression in cell line models was necessary for imatinib-induced antitumor responses. We have demonstrated that IRF-8 is a direct target of STAT5 and that silencing of STAT5 induced IRF-8 expression. Conversely, activating STAT5 suppressed IRF-8 transcription. Finally, we showed that STAT5 blockade using a recently discovered antagonist increased IRF-8 expression in patient samples. These data reveal a previously unrecognized BCR-ABL-STAT5-IRF-8 network, which widens the repertoire of potentially new anti-CML targets."
https://openalex.org/W2046931245,"Degradation of heparan sulfate (HS) in the extracellular matrix by heparanase is linked to the processes of tumor invasion and metastasis. Thus, a heparanase inhibitor can be a potential anticancer drug. Because HS with unsubstituted glucosamine residues accumulates in heparanase-expressing breast cancer cells, we assumed that these HS structures are resistant to heparanase and can therefore be utilized as a heparanase inhibitor. As expected, chemically synthetic HS-tetrasaccharides containing unsubstituted glucosamine residues, GlcAβ1-4GlcNH3 (+)(6-O-sulfate)α1-4GlcAβ1-4GlcNH3 (+)(6-O-sulfate), inhibited heparanase activity and suppressed invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Bifunctional NDST-1 (N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1) catalyzes the modification of N-acetylglucosamine residues within HS chains, and the balance of N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activities of NDST-1 is thought to be a determinant of the generation of unsubstituted glucosamine. We also report here that EXTL3 (exostosin-like 3) controls N-sulfotransferase activity of NDST-1 by forming a complex with NDST-1 and contributes to generation of unsubstituted glucosamine residues."

However, the molecular interactions underpinning the role of CD157 in these processes remain obscure. The biological functions of CD157 and its partnership with members of the integrin family prompted us to assume the existence of a direct interaction between CD157 and an unknown component of the extracellular matrix. Using solid-phase binding assays and surface plasmon resonance analysis, we demonstrated that CD157 binds fibronectin with high affinity within its heparin-binding domains 1 and 2. Furthermore, we found that CD157 binds to other extracellular matrix proteins containing heparin-binding domains. Finally, we proved that the CD157-fibronectin interaction occurs with living cells, where it elicits CD157-mediated cell responses. Indeed, knockdown of CD157 in Met-5A mesothelial cells changed their morphology and cytoskeleton organization and attenuated the activation of intracellular signaling pathways triggered by fibronectin. This led to impaired cell spreading and adhesion to selected extracellular matrix proteins.

Little is known about the signaling mechanisms of Reelin and F-spondin. Reelin is a glycoprotein that is secreted in the embryonic cortex by Cajal-Retzius cells and in the adult by interneurons (2Tissir F. Goffinet A.M. Reelin and brain development.Nat. Rev.

Reelin has an N-terminal domain important for dimerization, eight repeats of about 350 amino acids, and a C-terminal domain of 32 amino acids (20Royaux I. Lambert de Rouvroit C. D'Arcangelo G.

Here we show strong clustering of ApoER2 induced by F-spondin and Reelin but relatively weak clustering with the ligand apoE. This clustering involves numerous proteins besides ApoER2, including APP and the synaptic adaptor protein PSD-95. Interestingly, we did not observe strong clustering of ApoER2 with VLDLR. Constructs of murine ApoER2 and human VLDLR cDNAs are shown in Fig. 1. Construct 1 is full-length murine ApoER2 without a tag in the p3GFLAG vector under the CMV promoter. Constructs 2, 3, and 4 are full-length murine ApoER2 constructs fused at either the C or N terminus with myc or HA tags: construct 2, ApoER2 construct with C terminus HA tag (ApoER2-HA); construct 3, ApoER2 with C terminus myc tag (ApoER2-myc); and construct 4, N terminus HA tag and C terminus myc tag (HA-ApoER2-myc). Construct 5 is the human ApoER2 construct missing the ligand-binding repeats. This construct has the endogenous signal peptide, the EGF-like domain, the glycosylation domain, the transmembrane domain, and the C terminus cytoplasmic domain (ApoER2-ΔLBD). Construct 6 is an ApoER2 construct missing the C terminus cytoplasmic domain. It has only the first 11 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain. This construct has an N terminus HA tag (ApoER2-HAΔICD). Construct 7 is human VLDLR-myc in the pSEC, tag2 hygro plasmid under the CMV promoter. All constructs have either the endogenous ApoER2 or VLDLR signal peptides (constructs 1–7) to direct protein expression to the endoplasmic reticulum. All DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid expressing Fc-RAP containing a V5 tag was a gift from Joachim Herz (43Strasser V. Fasching D. Hauser C. Mayer H. Bock H.H. Hiesberger T. Herz J. Weeber E.J. Sweatt J.D. Pramatarova A.

Full-length PSD-95 was expressed with a C-terminal GFP tag. Purified recombinant human F-spondin and mouse Reelin were obtained from R&D Biosystems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human apoE was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). These forms of apoE were primarily monomeric, as determined by immunoblots (44Tamboli I.Y. Heo D. Rebeck G.W. Extracellular proteolysis of apolipoprotein E (apoE) by secreted serine neuronal protease.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e93120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Human plasma HDL was purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Purified receptor-associated protein (RAP) was a gift from Dr. Guojun Bu (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Fc-RAP was isolated from the medium of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the Fc-RAP construct for 48 h. The medium was collected, treated with protease inhibitors (Promega, Madison, WI), and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Millipore) overnight to precipitate Fc-RAP. The beads were washed three times with TBS-T buffer (TBS with 1% Tween), and the Fc-RAP was eluted in 100 mm glycine buffer at pH 1.9 using Polyprep chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). Elution fractions were collected to identify the presence of Fc-RAP via immunoblot analyses with mouse V5 antibody (Invitrogen). The glycine buffer was dialyzed against PBS using Millipore dialysis cassettes. The following antibodies were used: anti-ApoER2 (rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000) and anti-HA (mouse, monoclonal, 1:1000) from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); anti-Myc (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000); anti-V5 tag; (mouse monoclonal, 1:1000) from Invitrogen; anti-VLDLR antibodies (5F3, mouse monoclonal), a gift from Dr. Dudley Strickland; Ab74 (mouse monoclonal), a gift from Dr. Johannes Nimpf; anti-Dab-1 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000) from Abcam; and anti-PSD95 (mouse polyclonal, 1:1000) from Millipore. APP C-terminal mouse monoclonal antibody C.1 was from Paul Mathews. For transient transfections, COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For primary neuronal cultures, cortical neurons were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats at embryonic days 18 and 19. The cortical cultures were plated in Neurobasal medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 2% B-27, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 0.25% 100 × glutamine, and 0.1% of 10 mm glutamate (Invitrogen) on poly-d-lysine-coated plates at density of 200,000 cells/ml. The medium was changed after 5 days in vitro and supplemented with Neurobasal medium minus glutamate. For cortical cells grown on coverslips, the coverslips were acid-treated, coated with poly-d-lysine, and plated at 150,000 cells/ml. Primary neurons were treated at 21 days in vitro for most assays. COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum prior to transfections and transiently transfected with ApoER2 and VLDLR constructs (1 μg of DNA) with FuGENE in serum-free medium (Promega) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with the noted concentrations of F-spondin, Reelin (500 ng/ml), recombinant apoE3, and apoE4 (5μg), purified Fc-RAP, and purified RAP (3 μg) in serum-free medium for 1 h. Cultured cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor, and phosphate inhibitor mixtures), and lysates were stored at −20 °C. Cellular protein was measured by BCA assay (Bio-Rad). For IPs from transfected COS7 cells, 50–100 μg of protein was used. HA-ApoER2 was immunoprecipitated using 45 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Millipore) diluted 1:1 in IP buffer and 1 μl of HA mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam) at 4 °C overnight. For immunoprecipitations from primary neurons, 150 μg of cellular protein was used, with protein A-Sepharose beads (Millipore) diluted 1:1 in IP buffer and 1 μl of ApoER2 antibody. In both assays, the beads were centrifuged at 3000 rpm and washed four times in IP buffer at 4 °C. The beads were suspended in Laemmli buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol (65 μl), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then 20 μl were loaded on 8% polyacrylamide gels. For immunoblot analyses, 25–50 μg of protein was separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibody overnight. The blots were treated with secondary antibody and developed using SuperSignal West Pico or Dura luminol/enhancer solution (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO) on x-ray films. Films were developed and quantified using ImageJ software. Data are plotted as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed unpaired Student's t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p <0.01; ***, p < 0.001 compared with controls). Reelin is thought to induce clustering of ApoER2 and VLDLR and subsequent phosphorylation of Dab-1 (43Strasser V. Fasching D. Hauser C. Mayer H. Bock H.H. Hiesberger T. Herz J. Weeber E.J. Sweatt J.D. Pramatarova A. Howell B. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Receptor clustering is involved in Reelin signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1378-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but direct evidence of clustering has been lacking. To measure receptor clustering, we generated several different ApoER2 and VLDLR constructs with or without tags (Fig. 1). To measure whether ApoER2 formed homodimers, we used full-length ApoER2 without a tag and ApoER2 with a C-terminal HA tag (Fig. 2A). We first tested whether the antibodies against the C terminus of ApoER2 and against HA showed any cross-reactivity. COS-7 cells were transfected with either construct, and then cell lysates were probed with the two antibodies. As expected, the HA antibody detected only the species of ApoER2 with the HA tag, and the C-terminal ApoER2 antibody (α-ER2) detected only the species of ApoER2 with an untagged C terminus (Fig. 2B). ApoER2 appears as double bands in our blots, which is characteristic of ApoER2. The double band represents the differentially glycosylated form of ApoER2 (45Brandes C. Kahr L. Stockinger W.

To measure whether we could use these constructs to detect ligand-induced clustering of ApoER2, we first isolated Fc-RAP protein (Fig. 2C). The RAP protein binds ApoER2 avidly, and the RAP sequence was cloned behind the human Fc sequence to generate a dimeric RAP ligand (43Strasser V. Fasching D. Hauser C. Mayer H. Bock H.H. Hiesberger T. Herz J. Weeber E.J. Sweatt J.D. Pramatarova A. Howell B. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Receptor clustering is involved in Reelin signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1378-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We purified Fc-RAP prepared from conditioned medium from transfected COS-7 cells using protein A-Sepharose beads and analyzed the purified protein by immunoblotting (Fig. 2D). Reduced Fc-RAP (Fig. 2D, first lane) was the expected 80 kDa in size, whereas non-reduced Fc-RAP (second lane) was greater than 150 kDa in size, indicative of the expected dimeric form. To measure whether Fc-RAP induced ApoER2 clustering, we transfected COS-7 cells with HA-tagged and untagged ApoER2 and, 24 h later, treated cells with Fc-RAP for 1 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody and immunoblotted with the α-ER2 antibody (Fig. 2E). We observed untagged ApoER2 molecules precipitating with HA-tagged ApoER2 in the absence of treatment (Fig. 2E, first lane, C), but the amount of coprecipitation increased dramatically in the presence of Fc-RAP (second and third lanes). Purified untagged (monomeric) RAP did not induce co-precipitation of ApoER2 constructs (Fig. 2E, fourth lane). Quantification of the blots showed that Fc-RAP treatment induced ∼10-fold more clustering compared with control or RAP treatment (Fig. 2F). Because we detected some basal clustering in the absence of ligands, we hypothesized tha"

Some of the mutant receptors are not routed to the cell surface; instead, they are trapped in the cellular secretory pathway. The cell-permeant agonists/antagonists have been used to rescue some membrane receptors that are not targeted onto the cell membrane. Here, we chose three disease-associated mutations (W178S, G234D, and P290S), which all resulted in retention of PKR2 intracellularly. We show that a small molecule PKR2 antagonist (A457) dramatically increased cell surface expression and rescued the function of P290S PKR2, but had no effect on W178S and G234D PKR2. Furthermore, we also tested chemical chaperone glycerol on the cell surface expression and function of PKR2 mutants. Treatment with 10% glycerol significantly increased the cell surface expression and signaling of P290S and W178S PKR2. These data demonstrate that some Kallmann syndrome-associated, intracellularly retained mutant PKR2 receptors can be functionally rescued, suggesting a potential treatment strategy for patients bearing such mutations.

PKR2 and PK2 were identified by a candidate gene strategy based on the phenotypes of the mice deficient in the corresponding genes. Indeed, mice deficient in either PKR2 or PK2 phenocopy many of the KS-like features, i.e. atrophia of both olfactory bulb and the reproductive system, due to markedly reduced number of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing cells in the hypothalamus (11Matsumoto S.

The prevalence of PKR2 mutations is approximately 5% in KS patients from the general population; however, PKR2 mutations are found in 23.3% of the Maghrebian patients, presented with monogenic recessive or digenic/oligogenic transmission (14Sarfati J.

Mutant receptors with misfolding can be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the cellular secretory pathway. Some cell-permeant small molecule antagonist/agonists, however, can interact with intracellularly retained receptors and therefore aid their folding and transport to the plasma membrane. Such compounds, namely pharmacological chaperones, therefore have important therapeutic potential (21Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Petäjä-Repo U.

Moreover, a group of so-called “chemical chaperones” may facilitate protein refolding by stabilizing the conformation of a mutant protein or by manipulating the chaperones residing in the ER (25Perlmutter D.H. Chemical chaperones: a pharmacological strategy for disorders of protein folding and trafficking.Pediatr. Res. 2002; 52: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 26Chaudhuri T.K. Paul S. Protein-misfolding diseases and chaperone-based therapeutic approaches.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1331-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the effect of a small molecule PKR2 antagonist and a chemical chaperone (glycerol) on the surface expression and signaling of mutant PKR2 which are deficient in the membrane expression. Our data indicated that some of these mutants can be rescued, opening a new therapeutic avenue for KS patients. The human PKR2 tagged with a FLAG epitope at the N terminus was constructed as described (20Zhou X.T. Chen D.N. Xie Z.Q. Peng Z. Xia K.D. Liu H.D. Liu W. Su B. Li J.D. Functional analysis of the distal region of the third intracellular loop of PROKR2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 439: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding PKR2 harboring various mutations were engineered using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA,) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were plated on coverslips and transfected with wild-type (WT) or respective mutant PKR2-expressing plasmids. After various treatments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. For permeablization, cells were treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with blocking solution (PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin, 5% goat serum) for 1 h. Incubation with mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:200 dilution; Sigma) was performed at 4 °C overnight. After being washed with PBS, fluorescence-labeled secondary anti-mouse antibodies (1:400 dilution; Invitrogen) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a dark room. After incubation with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) for 5 min, cells were mounted in Fluoromount medium (Sigma), and fluorescence images were examined with a laser scanning confocal system installed on a Carl Zeiss microscope (Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) with a 63× oil immersion objective. To quantify the cell surface expression level, nonpermeabilized cells were immunostained as described above. For each condition, 50 fields were randomly selected, and images were taken. The fluorescence density of each image was calculated using the Metaphor software package. The average fluorescence density from cells expressing WT PKR2 was set as 100. All experiments were performed at least twice with a different batch of cells. An aequorin-based luminescent assay was used to measure mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Briefly, Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the photoprotein aequorin were transiently transfected with WT or respective mutant PKR2-expressing plasmids. Two days after transfection, the cells were charged in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 8 μm coelenterazine cp (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were detached by brief trypsinization and maintained in assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) at approximately 5 × 105 cells/ml. Luminescence measurements were made using a Sirius Single Tube Luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). PK2 was serially diluted in assay buffer and mixed with cells. The luminescence was monitored for 35 s (peak 1), then 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100 was injected to lyse the cells, and the luminescence was monitored continuously for another 20 s (peak 2). The area under the curve of the peak 1 was divided by the total area under the curve of peaks 1 and 2, and the maximal responses from WT receptors were normalized to 100. Three-dimensional structures of PKR2 were modeled with the intensive mode of the Phyre2 server. The sequences of WT and respective mutant PKR2 were submitted to the Phyre2 server, and six templates (c2ksaA (human substance-P receptor), c2rh1A (human β2-adrenergic receptor), c3emlA (human adenosine A2A receptor), c3uonA (human M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor), c4djhA (human κ-type opioid receptor), and c3pdsA (human β2-adrenergic receptor)) were selected to model the protein based on heuristics to maximize the confidence, percentage identity, and alignment coverage. A repeated measures ANOVA followed by unpaired t test was used to analyze the data for differences. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 4.4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). We chose three KS-associated PKR2 mutants that are reported to be deficient in the cell surface expression, including W178S, G234D, and P290S (10Dodé C. Rondard P. PROK2/PROKR2 signaling and Kallmann syndrome.Front. Endocrinol. 2013; 12: 19Google Scholar, 18Monnier C. Dodé C. Fabre L. Teixeira L. Labesse G. Pin J.P. Hardelin J.P. Rondard P. PROKR2 missense mutations associated with Kallmann syndrome impair receptor signalling activity.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These mutations are located at the fourth, fifth, and sixth transmembrane domains, respectively (Fig. 1A). The subcellular localization of N-terminally FLAG-tagged WT or mutant PKR2 was determined by immunofluorescence using an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, the WT receptor was localized predominantly on the cell surface. In contrast, all of the mutant receptors were undetectable on the cell surface, consistent with previous report using radioligand binding and cell surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (18Monnier C. Dodé C. Fabre L. Teixeira L. Labesse G. Pin J.P. Hardelin J.P. Rondard P. PROKR2 missense mutations associated with Kallmann syndrome impair receptor signalling activity.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Instead, they were trapped intracellularly as detected with immunofluorescence in the permeabilized cells (Fig. 1B). Structural modeling of WT and three mutant PKR2 was made to understand how these mutations affect the likely three-dimensional structure of PKR2. As shown in Fig. 2A, the W178S mutation did not lead to significant structure change. However, the G234D mutation resulted in disruption in transmembrane domain III (amino acids 120–160, Fig. 2, A and B), whereas the P290S mutation led to disruption in transmembrane domain IV (amino acids 165–190) and subtle distortion in transmembrane domain VI (amino acids 270–300, Fig. 2, A, C, and D). Some small molecule agonists/antagonists, so called pharmacological chaperones, can interact with intracellularly retained receptors and aid their folding and/or transport onto the plasma membrane (21Morello J.P.

We recently synthesized a group of compounds that can specifically inhibit ligand-induced PKR2 signaling (27Curtis V.F. Wang H. Yang P. McLendon R.E. Li X. Zhou Q.Y. Wang X.F.

Prokineticin 2 regulates the electrical activity of rat suprachiasmatic nuclei neurons.PloS One. 2011; 6: e20263Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, a small molecule, A457, suppressed the PKR2 signaling with an IC50 of 102 nm (PK2: 40 nm, EC50, 7.8 nm). By using immunofluorescence, we showed that treatment with A457 (1 μm) for 16 h dramatically increased the cell surface expression of P290S PKR2 (5.87 ± 0.66 versus 101.88 ± 7.61, p < 0.001, n = 50) whereas it did not affect that of W178S (4.36 ± 0.42 versus 6.08 ± 0.48, p > 0.05, n = 50) and G234D PKR2 (1.30 ± 0.18 versus 5.09 ± 0.51, p > 0.05, n = 50) (Fig. 3, B and C). The effect of A457 on the cell surface expression of P290S PKR2 was dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 3, D and E). A subtle increase was observed after incubation with A457 (1 μm) for 1–2 h (0 h: 8.02 ± 0.64; 1 h: 18.19 ± 2.13, p > 0.05; 2 h: 18.45 ± 1.48, p > 0.05, n = 50), and longer incubation (>4 h) steadily increased the cell surface expression of P290S PKR2 (4 h: 27.52 ± 4.67, p < 0.05; 8 h: 51.45 ± 4.26, p < 0.0001; 16 h: 123.58 ± 9.53, p < 0.0001; n = 50; Fig. 3D). Starting from 10 nm, A457 dose-dependently increased the cell surface expression of P290S PKR2 (0 nm: 8.94 ± 0.71; 1 nm: 21.28 ± 3.02, p > 0.05; 10 nm: 60.43 ± 4.32, p < 0.001; 100 nm: 83.34 ± 3.88, p < 0.001; 1 μm: 100.10 ± 5.65, p < 0.001; n = 50; Fig. 3E). As A457 potently inhibited PKR2 signaling (Fig. 3A), we washed A457-treated cells with PBS three times and measured the PKR2 signaling 8 h later, which efficiently eliminated the inhibitory effect of A457 on PKR2 signaling (data not shown). PK2 dose-dependently increased the intracellular calcium concentration in cells expressing WT, but not three mutant PKR2 (Fig. 4, A–C). However, incubation with A457 (1 μm) for 8 h significantly promoted the signaling of P290S PKR2 (Fig. 4A). No signaling was observed in cells transfected with W178S or G234D PKR2 after A457 treatment (Fig. 4, B and C). The rescue of signaling of P290S PKR2 by antagonist was also dose- and time-dependent. Starting from 100 nm, a significant increase in the signaling was observed after A457 treatment (0 nm: 7.61 ± 2.48; 1 nm: 8.44 ± 3.33, p > 0.05; 10 nm: 23.55 ± 8.34, p > 0.05; 100 nm: 46.84 ± 9.28, p < 0.05; 1 μm: 63.60 ± 5.60, p < 0.01; n = 3; Fig. 4D), consistent with the cell surface expression (Fig. 3E). Moreover, the rescue of signaling could be observed as early as 2 h after incubation with 1 μm A457 (0 h: 7.16 ± 2.01; 1 h: 29.12 ± 1.75, p > 0.05; 2 h: 38.66 ± 0.04, p < 0.01; 4 h: 41.08 ± 0.67, p < 0.01; 8 h: 49.48 ± 1.37; 16 h: 90.69 ± 15.98, p < 0.001; n = 3; Fig. 4E). It is interesting that incubation with 1 μm A457 for 2 h only subtly increased the cell surface expression (Fig. 3D). We thus speculated that some of the mutant receptors may traffic onto the cell surface during the washout period (8 h) after A457 treatment, especially considering that 10 nm A457 was able to promote the cell surface of P290S PKR2 (Fig. 3E). We therefore compared the cell surface expression of P290S PKR2 with or without 8 h of washout after treatment with 1 μm A457 for 1–4 h. As shown in Fig. 4F, 8 h of washout indeed significantly increased the cell surface expression (0 h: 6.49 ± 0.52 versus 10.41 ± 0.65, p > 0.05; 1 h: 14.72 ± 1.72 versus 28.22 ± 2.66, p < 0.01; 2 h: 14.93 ± 1.20 versus 46.28 ± 2.88, p < 0.01; 4 h: 22.27 ± 3.78 versus 65.84 ± 3.68, p < 0.01; n = 50). The folding and synthesis of a protein may occur simultaneously. To see whether the pharmacological chaperone A457 has to be present at the time of protein synthesis to function, we incubated cells with 100 nm cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 5, CHX treatment (16 h) only slightly affected the signaling of WT PKR2. PK2 was not able to induce calcium immobilization in cells transfected with P290S PKR2 regardless of the presence or absence of CHX. Preincubation with A457 led to significant signaling of P290S PKR2 even in the presence of CHX. Our data thus indicated that new protein synthesis is not required for A457 to rescue P290S PKR2. Instead, A457 may stabilize the conformation of the previously misfolded/retained PKR2 receptors and aid their route onto the plasma membrane. The differential effect of A457 on the cell surface expression and signaling of PKR2 mutants may be attributable to either the drug or the mutations, or both. The so-called chemical chaperones, such as glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide, may broadly promote the protein folding by decreasing the solvent-accessible surface area of the protein (30Raibekas A.A.

Chemical and pharmacological chaperones: application for recombinant protein production and protein folding diseases.Curr. Med. Chem. 2011; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To dissect the mechanism underlying the differential effect of A457 on mutant PKR2, we further investigated the effect of glycerol on the cell surface and signaling of above-mentioned PKR2 mutants. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, 10% glycerol increased the cell surface expression of P290S (5.87 ± 0.66 versus 38.25 ± 3.34, p < 0.001, n = 50) and W178S (4.36 ± 0.42 versus 41.04 ± 2.82, p < 0.001, n = 50) PKR2, but not G234D (1.30 ± 0.18 versus 3.23 ± 0.86, p > 0.05, n = 50) PKR2. We therefore used P290S PKR2 as a model to study the incubation time on the cell surface expression. As shown in Fig. 6C, no significant increase of cell surface expression was observed until incubation with glycerol for 4 h (0 h: 10.77 ± 1.23; 1 h: 13.33 ± 1.67, p > 0.05; 2 h: 10.34 ± 1.03, p > 0.05; 4 h: 24.74 ± 3.07, p < 0.01; 8 h: 36.40 ± 4.25, p < 0.001; 16 h: 58.06 ± 5.10, p < 0.001; n = 50). Both W178S and P290S PKR2 rescued by glycerol were functional as measured with an aequorin-based calcium mobilization assay (Fig. 7).FIGURE 710% glycerol rescued the function of W178S and P290S PKR2. Cells expressing W178S (A), G234D (B), and P290S (C) PKR2 were treated with 10% glycerol for 8 h and washed three times with PBS, and PK2-induced calcium mobilization was measured 8 h later. Cells expressing WT PKR2 were used as a control. Experiments were performed at least three times with a different batch of cells with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of glycerol is concentration-dependent. As shown in Fig. 8A, 1% glycerol showed minimal effect on the cell surface expression of P290S PKR2 (control: 6.12 ± 0.96; 1%: 14.87 ± 0.93, p > 0.05, n = 50); however, treatment with 4 and 10% glycerol for 8 h significantly increased cell surface expression of P290S PKR2 (4%: 29.70 ± 3.18, p < 0.001; 10% 46.84 ± 3.89, p < 0.001; n = 50). Consistent with the cell surface expression, 4 and 10% glycerol significantly increased the PK2-induced calcium mobilization in cells expressing P290S PKR2 (control: 11.91 ± 1.62; 1%: 19.76 ± 1.59, p > 0.05; 4%: 39.25 ± 5.67, p < 0.001; 10%: 54.41 ± 2.49, p < 0.001; n = 3; Fig. 8B). The ER and Golgi apparatus are the cellular organelles where synthesis and processing of secretory and membrane protein occur. The ER provides an environment for newly synthesized polypeptide to fold properly. The correctly folded proteins are then allowed to enter the processing pathway at the Golgi apparatus, leading to their final destinations within the cell. However, if a polypeptide does not fold correctly, the incorrect protein conformation must be recognized by the quality control system in the ER (32Pfeffer S.R. Rothman J.E.

Several strategies, including genetic, chemical, and pharmacological approaches, have been used to correct folding and rescue the function of trafficking-defective proteins, especially membrane receptors. Among these, pharmacological chaperones, i.e. small compounds that bind selectively to misfolded proteins and correct their folding and routing onto the plasma membrane, seems to be the most promising (44Conn P.M.

In the case of G protein-coupled receptors, most pharmacological chaperones are antagonists or agonists to the receptors. In a pioneer work, Morello et al. showed that treatment with a selective, cell-permeant vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist SR121463A rescue the cell surface targeting and function of several mutant V2 receptors associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (21Morello J.P.

Recently, Newton et al. showed that an allosterically binding small molecule agonist functionally rescue the mutant luteinizing hormone receptors that cause Leydig cell hypoplasia (24Newton C.L.

They showed that pharmacological chaperones could restore the testis function in hypogonadotropic hypogonadal mice harboring a misfolded gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor mutant (46Janovick J.A.

More than 20 different PKR2 mutations have been identified to be associated with KS/idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and six (R80C, L173R, W178S, G234D, V274D, and P290S) were reported to affect the trafficking (10Dodé C. Rondard P. PROK2/PROKR2 signaling and Kallmann syndrome.Front. Endocrinol. 2013; 12: 19Google Scholar, 18Monnier C. Dodé C. Fabre L. Teixeira L. Labesse G. Pin J.P. Hardelin J.P. Rondard P. PROKR2 missense mutations associated with Kallmann syndrome impair receptor signalling activity.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We chose three mutations that are located in the transmembrane domain and deficient in trafficking to study the rescuing effect of a small molecule PKR2 antagonist, A457. Our results indicated that A457 can rescue the cell surface expression and function of P290S PKR2, but not W178S and G234D PKR2. It should be noted that G234D cannot be rescued by A457 or glycerol, implying that G234D mutation may result in a distorted conformation unfavorable for either strategy. We speculate that the introduction of a negatively charged aspartic acid may cause conformational changes and/or damage intramolecular interaction in PKR2 receptor. Indeed, the structural modeling indicated that G234D mutation can cause the disruption of transmembrane domain III (amino acids 120–160, Fig. 2, A and B). However, the cell surface expression and signaling of W178S were rescued by glycerol, but not A457. We speculate that the incapability of A457 to rescue W178S PKR2 may be attributable to its binding pocket on the receptor, i.e. A457 may only affect the conformation around its binding site. We thus propose that A457 binds to a site close to the fourth transmembrane domain, which was predicted to be disrupted in P290S mutant. Actually, A457 was also able to subtly rescue V274D PKR2 (data not shown), which may also distort the fourth transmembrane domain (20Zhou X.T. Chen D.N. Xie Z.Q. Peng Z. Xia K.D. Liu H.D. Liu W. Su B. Li J.D. Functional analysis of the distal region of the third intracellular loop of PROKR2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 439: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise mechanism will not be clear until a co-crystal structure is solved. Another strategy to prevent misfolding or correct a mutant protein conformation is to influence the protein folding environment inside the cell. Studies suggest that chemical chaperones, such as glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide, are effective in inhibiting the formation of misfolded structure by decreasing the solvent-accessible surface area of the protein. In this study, we showed that 4–10% glycerol increased the cell surface expression of W178S and P290S PKR2. Interestingly, the rescued W178S showed signaling activity almost identical to that of the WT PKR2 receptor, implying that W178S mutation only affects the trafficking. However, although the signaling of P290S PKR2 can be rescued by A457 and glycerol, the efficacy (EC50) and maximal response were lower than WT PKR2, indicating that P290S mutation somehow interferes with the ligand binding and/or G protein coupling, in addition to trafficking. The structural modeling indicated that W178S mutation only resulted in mild alteration in the structure whereas P290S mutation disrupted two transmembrane helices (amino acids 165–190 and 270–300, respectively). In summary, we demonstrated that a small molecule PKR2 antagonist and glycerol can rescue the cell surface expression and signaling of certain Kallmann syndrome-associated PKR2 mutants with trafficking deficiency. Our study thus provides a proof of concept for using pharmacological chaperone to treat patients harboring trafficking-defective PKR2 mutations. We thank Dr. Zhiqun Xie for the molecular modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2045627541,"Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) initiates the repair of G·T mismatches that arise by deamination of 5-methylcytosine (mC), and it excises 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine, oxidized forms of mC. TDG functions in active DNA demethylation and is essential for embryonic development. TDG forms a tight enzyme-product complex with abasic DNA, which severely impedes enzymatic turnover. Modification of TDG by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins weakens its binding to abasic DNA. It was proposed that sumoylation of product-bound TDG regulates product release, with SUMO conjugation and deconjugation needed for each catalytic cycle, but this model remains unsubstantiated. We examined the efficiency and specificity of TDG sumoylation using in vitro assays with purified E1 and E2 enzymes, finding that TDG is modified efficiently by SUMO-1 and SUMO-2. Remarkably, we observed similar modification rates for free TDG and TDG bound to abasic or undamaged DNA. To examine the conjugation step directly, we determined modification rates (kobs) using preformed E2∼SUMO-1 thioester. The hyperbolic dependence of kobs on TDG concentration gives kmax = 1.6 min(-1) and K1/2 = 0.55 μM, suggesting that E2∼SUMO-1 has higher affinity for TDG than for the SUMO targets RanGAP1 and p53 (peptide). Whereas sumoylation substantially weakens TDG binding to DNA, TDG∼SUMO-1 still binds relatively tightly to AP-DNA (Kd ∼50 nM). Although E2∼SUMO-1 exhibits no specificity for product-bound TDG, the relatively high conjugation efficiency raises the possibility that E2-mediated sumoylation could stimulate product release in vivo. This and other implications for the biological role and mechanism of TDG sumoylation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1967117460,"The net effect of pollen production on fecundity in plants can range from negative – when self-pollen interferes with fecundity due to incompatibility mechanisms, to positive – when pollen availability is associated with increased pollinator visitation and fecundity due to its utilization as a reward. We investigated the responses of bees to pollen and nectar rewards, and the effects of these rewards on pollen deposition and fecundity in the hermaphroditic succulent shrub Aloe tenuior. Self-pollinated plants failed to set fruit, but their ovules were regularly penetrated by self-pollen tubes, which uniformly failed to develop into seeds as expected from ovarian self-incompatibility (or strong early inbreeding depression). Bees consistently foraged for pollen during the morning and early afternoon, but switched to nectar in the late afternoon. As a consequence of this differential foraging, we were able to test the relative contribution to fecundity of pollen- versus nectar-collecting flower visitors. We exposed emasculated and intact flowers in either the morning or late afternoon to foraging bees and showed that emasculation reduced pollen deposition by insects in the morning, but had little effect in the afternoon. Despite the potential for self-pollination to result in ovule discounting due to late-acting self-sterility, fecundity was severely reduced in artificially emasculated plants. Although there were temporal fluctuations in reward preference, most bee visits were for pollen rewards. Therefore the benefit of providing pollen that is accessible to bee foragers outweighs any potential costs to fitness in terms of gender interference in this species."
https://openalex.org/W1976518128,"There are multiple isoforms of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), which regulate diverse cellular functions such as cell growth, proliferation, maturation, and motility. However, the relationship between the structures and functions of RSK isoforms remains undetermined. Artemia is a useful model in which to study cell cycle arrest because these animals undergo prolonged diapauses, a state of obligate dormancy. A novel RSK isoform was identified in Artemia, which was termed Ar-Rsk2. This isoform was compared with an RSK isoform that we previously identified in Artemia, termed Ar-Rsk1. Ar-Rsk2 has an ERK-docking motif, whereas Ar-Rsk1 does not. Western blot analysis revealed that Ar-Rsk1 was activated by phosphorylation, which blocked meiosis in oocytes. Knockdown of Ar-Rsk1 reduced the level of phosphorylated cdc2 and thereby suppressed cytostatic factor activity. This indicates that Ar-Rsk1 regulates the cytostatic factor in meiosis. Expression of Ar-Rsk2 was down-regulated in Artemia cysts in which mitosis was arrested. Knockdown of Ar-Rsk2 resulted in decreased levels of cyclin D3 and phosphorylated histone H3, and the production of pseudo-diapause cysts. This indicates that Ar-Rsk2 regulates mitotic arrest. PLK and ERK RNAi showed that Ar-Rsk2, but not Ar-Rsk1, could be activated by PLK-ERK in Artemia. This is the first study to report that RSK isoforms with and without an ERK-docking motif regulate mitosis and meiosis, respectively. This study provides insight into the relationship between the structures and functions of RSK isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2065134696,"The activation of programmed cell death (PCD) is often a result of complex signalling pathways whose relationship and intersection are not well understood. We recently described a PCD root hair assay and proposed that it could be used to rapidly screen genetic or pharmacological modulators of PCD. To further assess the applicability of the root hair assay for studying multiple signalling pathways leading to PCD activation we have investigated the crosstalk between salicylic acid, autophagy and apoptosis-like PCD (AL-PCD) in Arabidopsis thaliana. The root hair assay was used to determine rates of AL-PCD induced by a panel of cell death inducing treatments in wild type plants treated with chemical modulators of salicylic acid synthesis or autophagy, and in genetic lines defective in autophagy or salicylic acid signalling. The assay demonstrated that PCD induced by exogenous salicylic acid or fumonisin B1 displayed a requirement for salicylic acid signalling and was partially dependent on the salicylic acid signal transducer NPR1. Autophagy deficiency resulted in an increase in the rates of AL-PCD induced by salicylic acid and fumonisin B1, but not by gibberellic acid or abiotic stress. The phenylalanine ammonia lyase-dependent salicylic acid synthesis pathway contributed only to death induced by salicylic acid and fumonisin B1. 3-Methyladenine, which is commonly used as an inhibitor of autophagy, appeared to influence PCD induction in all treatments suggesting a possible secondary, non-autophagic, effect on a core component of the plant PCD pathway. The results suggest that salicylic acid signalling is negatively regulated by autophagy during salicylic acid and mycotoxin-induced AL-PCD. However, this crosstalk does not appear to be directly involved in PCD induced by gibberellic acid or abiotic stress. This study demonstrates that the root hair assay is an effective tool for relatively rapid investigation of complex signalling pathways leading to the activation of PCD."
https://openalex.org/W2130145548,"β-Primeverosidase (PD) is a disaccharide-specific β-glycosidase in tea leaves. This enzyme is involved in aroma formation during the manufacturing process of oolong tea and black tea. PD hydrolyzes β-primeveroside (6-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) at the β-glycosidic bond of primeverose to aglycone, and releases aromatic alcoholic volatiles of aglycones. PD only accepts primeverose as the glycone substrate, but broadly accepts various aglycones, including 2-phenylethanol, benzyl alcohol, linalool, and geraniol. We determined the crystal structure of PD complexes using highly specific disaccharide amidine inhibitors, N-β-primeverosylamidines, and revealed the architecture of the active site responsible for substrate specificity. We identified three subsites in the active site: subsite -2 specific for 6-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl, subsite -1 well conserved among β-glucosidases and specific for β-d-glucopyranosyl, and wide subsite +1 for hydrophobic aglycone. Glu-470, Ser-473, and Gln-477 act as the specific hydrogen bond donors for 6-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl in subsite -2. On the other hand, subsite +1 was a large hydrophobic cavity that accommodates various aromatic aglycones. Compared with aglycone-specific β-glucosidases of the glycoside hydrolase family 1, PD lacks the Trp crucial for aglycone recognition, and the resultant large cavity accepts aglycone and 6-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl together. PD recognizes the β-primeverosides in subsites -1 and -2 by hydrogen bonds, whereas the large subsite +1 loosely accommodates various aglycones. The glycone-specific activity of PD for broad aglycone substrates results in selective and multiple release of temporally stored alcoholic volatile aglycones of β-primeveroside."
https://openalex.org/W2049052668,"There have been several studies of the neural mechanisms underlying sensation of fatigue. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying self-evaluation of the level of fatigue. The aim of this study was to identify the neural substrates involved in self-evaluation of the level of mental fatigue. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) with high temporal resolution on 14 healthy participants. During MEG recordings, participants were asked to evaluate their level of mental fatigue in time with execution cues (evaluation trials) or to do nothing in time with execution cues (control trials). The MEG data were analyzed with equivalent current dipole (ECD) and spatial filtering methods to localize the neural activity related to the evaluation of mental fatigue. The daily level of fatigue sensation was assessed using the Checklist Individual Strength questionnaire. In evaluation trials, ECDs were observed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in seven of 14 participants, with a mean latency of 366.0 ms. The proportion of the participants with ECDs in the PCC was higher in evaluation trials than in control trials (P<0.05, McNemar test). The extent of the decreased delta band power in the PCC (Brodmann's area 31) 600-700 ms after the onset of the execution cue and that in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; Brodmann's area 9) 800-900 ms after the onset of the execution cue were greater in the evaluation trials than in the control trials. The decrease in delta band power in the DLPFC was positively related to that in the PCC and to the daily level of fatigue sensation. These data suggest that the PCC and DLPFC are involved in the self-evaluation of mental fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W2072617651,"Cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations constitute a widespread signaling mode and are often generated in response to stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors that activate phospholipase C. In mast cells, repetitive Ca2+ oscillations can be evoked by modest activation of cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptors by the physiological trigger, leukotriene C4.

Reversible receptor desensitization enables phasic Ca2+ signals to occur, thereby bypassing the deleterious consequences of a sustained Ca2+ rise that include excitotoxicity and Ca2+-dependent inhibition of signaling molecules. Mechanisms that control the rate and extent of receptor desensitization will therefore have a profound influence on the spatiotemporal pattern of agonist-evoked Ca2+ signals and the subsequent activation of downstream targets. Here we report that the scaffolding protein caveolin-1 enhances desensitization of CysLT1 receptors. The amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations is initially increased by caveolin-1, because of enhanced coupling between the receptor and phospholipase C. However, the increased Ca2+ mobilization stimulates Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C, which then terminates the oscillatory response by accelerating receptor desensitization.

Ca2+-free solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ imaging experiments were carried out using a TILL Photonics system with an IMAGO CCD camera. Cells were excited alternately at 356 and 380 nm, and images were acquired every 2 s. Images were analyzed off line using IGOR Pro for Windows. Ca2+ signals are represented at a ratio of 356/380 nm. The experiments illustrated in Fig. 9 were carried out using the imaging system in the laboratory of Dr. Glitsch (Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford) while repair work was being carried out on our imaging system. For immunocytochemistry, cells were transfected with caveolin-1-RFP and FLAG-tagged CysLT1 receptor and then fixed 48 h later with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. After that, cells were incubated with blocking solution (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h and then incubated with specific primary antibody against FLAG tag (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibody against rabbit IgG was conjugated with Alexa-488 purchased from Invitrogen. Images were obtained by using an Olympus confocal microscope. Relative fluorescence intensity was analyzed using ImageJ software. For cells transfected with GFP-PHD, immunofluorescence images were obtained with a Leica microscope, and the fluorescence intensity was analyzed by ImageJ software. For colocalization studies, confocal images were taken with an FV-1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY), and the colocalization coefficient between two different channels was assessed by the Olympus Fluoview FV1000 system. At least five representative images in each group were used for analysis and 10 different areas on the cell membrane and in the cytosol were selected to obtain Pearson's correlation coefficient. 24–36 h following transfection with an EGFP-based reporter plasmid under an NFAT promoter, cells were stimulated with LTC4 (see text for specific times). The percentage of GFP-positive cells was measured as describe previously (8Kar P. Nelson C. Parekh A.B. Selective activation of the transcription factor NFAT1 by calcium microdomains near Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 14795-14803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All results were expressed as mean ± S.E. A two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare differences between two groups, and one-way analysis of variance was used to compare differences when groups numbered three or more (GraphPad Prism). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05, with one, two, and three asterisks denoting p < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively. Endogenous levels of caveolin-1 were virtually undetectable in Western blots from RBL-1 cells (data not shown), so we overexpressed the GFP-tagged protein to study its impact on Ca2+ oscillations. In non-transfected (wild type) cells, stimulation with LTC4 evoked a series of cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 1A), which decreased slightly over time due to receptor desensitization (Fig. 1B) (6Ng S.W. Bakowski D. Nelson C. Mehta R. Almeyda R. Bates G. Parekh A.B. Cysteinyl leukotriene type I receptor desensitization sustains Ca2+-dependent gene expression.Nature. 2012; 482: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression of caveolin-1-GFP substantially altered the pattern of the Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 1A, dotted trace). The amplitudes of the initial Ca2+ oscillations evoked by LTC4 were now considerably larger than in non-transfected cells (Fig. 1, A and C), but the oscillations ran down more quickly and so were fewer in number over a 600 to 700-s recording period (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the various oscillatory parameters revealed that the total Ca2+ rise associated with each oscillation (area under the spike) was significantly larger in cells expressing caveolin-1-GFP (Fig. 1D); this reflected both an increase in the amplitude of each Ca2+ oscillation (Fig. 1C) as well as an increase in duration (Fig. 1E). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ during each oscillation was therefore elevated for a longer time in the presence of caveolin-1-GFP. The effects of caveolin-1-GFP were not mimicked by expression of GFP alone (Fig. 1, B and C). However, caveolin-1-RFP replicated the marked effects of caveolin-1-GFP on the pattern of Ca2+ oscillations (data not shown). Responses in the presence of external Ca2+ reflect both InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels, the latter being required to replenish the stores with Ca2+ in readiness for the next oscillatory cycle. To see which of these processes was affected by caveolin-1, we separated Ca2+ release from Ca2+ entry by stimulating cells with LTC4 in the absence of external Ca2+ and then readmitting external Ca2+ once the oscillations had run down. Because of the lack of Ca2+ influx, Ca2+ oscillations decreased in size over time and were lost typically within 400 s after stimulation (the control cell is shown in Fig. 1F, and aggregate data are summarized in Fig. 1G). Readmission of external Ca2+ after 600 s resulted in Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels (Fig. 1F). Expression of caveolin-1-GFP increased the amplitude of the Ca2+ oscillations in Ca2+-free solution considerably (Fig. 1F; aggregate data are shown in Fig. 1H), but these oscillations ran down more quickly than the corresponding control recordings (Fig. 1G). Readmission of external Ca2+ led to a significantly larger rate of rise of Ca2+ (Fig. 1, F and I), indicating increased store-operated Ca2+ influx. Unlike the case of caveolin-1-GFP, expression of GFP alone had no effect on the number of Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 1G), the size of the oscillations (Fig. 1H), or store-operated Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1I and Ref. 12Moreau B. Straube S. Fisher R.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Parekh A.B. Ca2+ -calmodulin-dependent facilitation and Ca2+ inactivation of Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8776-8783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 increases the interaction between the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gq and phospholipase C (13Sengupta P. Philip F. Scarlata S. Caveolin-1 alters Ca2+ signal duration through specific interaction with the Gαq family of G proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a mechanism that could explain the increase in amplitude of the Ca2+ oscillations. If so, caveolin-1 should be expressed in the plasma membrane. Immunocytochemical studies revealed the presence of both FLAG-tagged CysLT1 receptors and caveolin-1-RFP in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). A significant fraction of caveolin-1-RFP was also found in the cytoplasm, likely reflecting its contribution to vesicle sorting (14Dupree P. Parton R.G. Raposo G. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Caveolae and sorting in the trans-Golgi network of epithelial cells.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1597-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To test for colocalization, at the level of resolution provided by confocal microscopy, we merged images and measured the subcellular distribution of each protein using line scanning (Fig. 2A, merged panel). CysLT1 receptor distribution showed two clear peaks, corresponding to plasma membrane at the two edges of the cell (Fig. 2B, green traces). Although caveolin-1-RFP was present within the cytoplasm, two peaks at the cell periphery were also resolvable, indicating a plasma membrane location. We quantified the extent of overlap of the two proteins using Pearson's correlation coefficient (Fig. 2C). Under both basal and stimulated conditions (LTC4 exposure for 10 min), there was a much better correlation between FLAG-tagged CysLT1 receptor and caveolin-1-RFP in the membrane than in the cytoplasm, and stimulation did not change the correlation coefficient (Fig. 2C). If caveolin-1 increases receptor-phospholipase C coupling, two predictions are that, first, InsP3 levels should increase more following stimulation in the presence of caveolin-1 than in wild type cells, and second, less Ca2+ should remain within the InsP3-sensitive store after the Ca2+ oscillations have run down in cells expressing caveolin-1. Using the GFP-PHD construct as a means for monitoring InsP3 levels in individual cells (15Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T.

J. 2001; 356: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we found that stimulation with LTC4 for 5 min resulted in a modest decrease in the membrane/cytosol ratio of GFP-PHD (decrease of 24.5 ± 1.7%; Fig. 3, A and B), and this was slightly more pronounced when caveolin-1-RFP was expressed (31.2 ± 1.4%, p < 0.05; Fig. 3, A and B). To test the second prediction, we stimulated cells with LTC4 in the absence of external Ca2+, and then once the oscillations had stopped, we applied thapsigargin in Ca2+-free solution to estimate how much Ca2+ remained within the store (Fig. 3C). The thapsigargin-mobilizable Ca2+ pool was significantly reduced in cells expressing caveolin-1-GFP (Fig. 3D, p < 0.01). The scaffolding domain of caveolin-1, which involves amino acids between residues 82 and 101, is required for interaction with receptors, G proteins, and other signaling molecules (18Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. Evidence for a regulated interaction between heterotrimeric G proteins and caveolin.J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). A central core of four amino acids within this region, encompassing 92FTVT95, is critical for association with G proteins (20Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. Identification of peptide and protein ligands for the caveolin-scaffolding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). To determine whether this central core was required for regulation of Ca2+ signals generated by CysLT1 receptors, we made mutations within the site to see the effect on Ca2+ oscillations. Following transfection of a GFP-tagged caveolin-1 construct in which phenylalanine (Phe-92) and threonine (Thr-95) had been mutated to alanines, several Ca2+ oscillations were seen in Ca2+-free solution (Fig. 4A); these were similar in size to those obtained in wild type cells (Fig. 4B). The number of oscillations in Ca2+-free solution (data not shown) and the rate of rise of the Ca2+ signal due to store-operated entry were also not significantly different from control cells (Fig. 4C). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations in response to LTC4 showed only modest rundown when transfected with the mutated caveolin-1 (Fig. 4D), which was not different from wild type cells (Fig. 4E). The size of these oscillations was also similar to that in wild type cells (Fig. 4F). We considered the possibility that expression of F92A,T95A caveolin-1-GFP was considerably lower than caveolin-1-GFP, thereby explaining the lack of effect of mutant caveolin-1 on Ca2+ oscillations. We therefore compared GFP fluorescence in cells transfected with either caveolin-1-GFP or F92A,T95A caveolin-1-GFP. There was no difference in either the profile of GFP expression between the two groups (Fig. 4G) or the averaged GFP fluorescence between the groups (Fig. 4H). In Fig. 4I, Ca2+ signals evoked by LTC4 are compared between a cell expressing caveolin-1-GFP and one expressing F92A,T95A caveolin-1-GFP. The cells had almost identical levels of GFP expression (92 and 93 gray scale units, respectively). However, only the presence of caveolin-1-GFP altered the pattern of the Ca2+ oscillations. Confocal images showed that both caveolin-1-RFP and F92A,T95A caveolin-1-RFP were expressed at the plasma membrane with FLAG-tagged CysLT1 receptors (Fig. 4J). Pearson's correlation coefficient between mutant caveolin-1-RFP and CysLT1 receptors was similar to that seen for caveolin-1-RFP and the receptors (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results show that the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 is important for the modulation of agonist-evoked Ca2+ oscillations. Phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14 by Src family kinases potentiates growth factor signaling and is required for internalization of caveolae (21Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Constitutive and growth factor-regulated phosphorylation of caveolin-1 occurs at the same site (Tyr-14) in vivo: identification of a c-src/Cav-1/Grb7 signaling cassette.Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of an RFP-tagged caveolin-1 construct with a point mutation converting tyrosine to phenylalanine (Y14F) was expressed in the plasma membrane (Fig. 4J) and mimicked the effects of caveolin-1-GFP expression on agonist-induced Ca2+ oscillations. The initial Ca2+ transients were larger (Fig. 4K), and fewer oscillations were obtained (Fig. 4L). Internalization of caveolin-1 through phosphorylation of tyrosine 14 therefore does not contribute to the effects of caveolin-1 on LTC4-driven Ca2+ signals. We designed experiments to identify the mechanism responsible for the accelerated rundown of Ca2+ oscillations seen in the presence of caveolin-1. To see whether this was dependent on Ca2+ release or Ca2+ entry, we stimulated cells in the absence of external Ca2+ but with the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump blocked with La3+. Under these conditions, Ca2+ release can no longer be exported out of the cell and instead is sequestrated back into the stores. Ca2+ oscillations therefore continue for several minutes, reflecting regenerative Ca2+ release in the absence of Ca2+ influx (11Di Capite J. Ng S.W. Parekh A.B.

Biol. 2009; 19: 853-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Putney J.W. Bird G.S. Cytoplasmic calcium oscillations and store-operated calcium influx.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 3055-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Stimulation with LTC4 in wild type cells evoked a series of repetitive Ca2+ oscillations that decreased slightly in number over time (Fig. 5, A and B). By contrast, in cells expressing caveolin-1-GFP, larger Ca2+ spikes were obtained initially, which then ran down quickly (Fig. 5, A and B). As with the responses in the presence of external Ca2+, the amplitude of the first oscillation (Fig. 5C), as well as the duration of the oscillations (Fig. 5D), was significantly increased in the presence of caveolin-1-GFP. Rundown of Ca2+ oscillations in the presence of caveolin-1 therefore arises from Ca2+ release. Further evidence that Ca2+ release from the stores in caveolin-1-expressing cells contributes to the rundown of the oscillations is shown in Fig. 6. In these experiments, we sought to partially lower the Ca2+ content of the stores in order to reduce the size of each Ca2+ oscillation upon stimulation. We therefore incubated control (non-transfected) cells in Ca2+-free solution for 10 min and found that this was sufficient to reduce the extent of Ca2+ release by thapsigargin by ∼ 30% when compared with control cells pre-exposed to Ca2+-free solution for just a few seconds prior to stimulation with thapsigargin (Fig. 6, A and C). We then stimulated cells in Ca2+-free solution containing 1 mm La3+ to eliminate the increased Ca2+ influx due to the reduced store Ca2+ content from affecting the oscillatory pattern. Oscillatory Ca2+ responses to LTC4 were sustained both in cells pretreated with Ca2+-free solution acutely (Fig. 6, D and I) and in those following 10 min of pretreatment (Fig. 6, E and I), although the size of the oscillations was smaller in the latter case (Fig. 6H), reflecting the reduced store Ca2+ content. In cells expressing caveolin-1-GFP and incubated in Ca2+-free solution for 10 min, the extent of Ca2+ release induced by thapsigargin was similar to control cells treated in the same way (Fig. 6, B and C). Whereas only a few Ca2+ oscillations were seen in response to LTC4 challenge in caveolin-1-GFP-expressing cells exposed to Ca2+-free solution for a few seconds prior to stimulation (Fig. 6, F and I), preincubation for 10 min with Ca2+-free external solution resulted in more prolonged oscillatory Ca2+ signals following agonist stimulation (Fig. 6, G and I). The amplitude of the first Ca2+ oscillation was reduced following the 10-min preincubation in Ca2+-free solution prior to stimulation (Fig. 6H). Hence, lowering the Ca2+ content of the stores results in prolonged oscillatory Ca2+ signals in the presence of caveolin-1-GFP. These results are consistent with the view that the enhanced Ca2+ release normally seen in caveolin-1-expressing cells is responsible for the accelerated rundown of the oscillations. One way whereby enhanced Ca2+ release can increase the rundown of Ca2+ oscillations is through Ca2+-dependent inactivation of InsP3 receptors. However, the Ca2+ release transient following phospholipase C-coupled P2Y receptor activation after CysLT1 receptors had been desensitized was slightly larger in caveolin-1-expressing cells (Fig. 7B) than in the corresponding controls (Fig. 7A; aggregate data are shown in Fig. 7C). Inactivation of the InsP3 receptor therefore plays little role in the rundown of Ca2+ oscillations in the presence of caveolin-1. We considered that rundown of the Ca2+ oscillations was a consequence of the accelerated desensitization of the CysLT1 receptor. These receptors are desensitized following Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of a series of serine residues on the carboxyl terminus of the receptor, and we had previously found a major role for protein kinase Cα in the desensitization process (6Ng S.W. Bakowski D. Nelson C. Mehta R. Almeyda R. Bates G. Parekh A.B.

For the integration of proteins into the membrane, the Sec61 translocon opens laterally to the lipid bilayer. Previous studies suggest that the lateral opening of the channel is mediated by the helices TM2b and TM7 of a pore-forming subunit of the Sec61 translocon. To map key residues in TM2b and TM7 in yeast Sec61 that modulate lateral gating activity, we performed alanine scanning and in vivo site-directed photocross-linking experiments. Alanine scanning identified two groups of critical residues in the lateral gate, one group that leads to defects in the translocation and membrane insertion of proteins and the other group that causes faster translocation and facilitates membrane insertion. Photocross-linking data show that the former group of residues is located at the interface of the lateral gate. Furthermore, different degrees of defects for the membrane insertion of single- and double-spanning membrane proteins were observed depending on whether the mutations were located in TM2b or TM7. These results demonstrate subtle differences in the molecular mechanism of the signal sequence binding/opening of the lateral gate and membrane insertion of a succeeding transmembrane segment in a polytopic membrane protein."

https://openalex.org/W2057884620,"LAMTOR2 (p14), a part of the larger LAMTOR/Ragulator complex, plays a crucial role in EGF-dependent activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK, ERK1/2). In this study, we investigated the role of LAMTOR2 in nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neuronal differentiation. Stimulation of PC12 (rat adrenal pheochromocytoma) cells with NGF is known to activate the MAPK. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK1 as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown of both p42 and p44 MAPK resulted in inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Contrary to expectations, siRNA-mediated knockdown of LAMTOR2 effectively augmented neurite formation and neurite length of PC12 cells. Ectopic expression of a siRNA-resistant LAMTOR2 ortholog reversed this phenotype back to wildtype levels, ruling out nonspecific off-target effects of this LAMTOR2 siRNA approach. Mechanistically, LAMTOR2 siRNA treatment significantly enhanced NGF-dependent MAPK activity, and this effect again was reversed upon expression of the siRNA-resistant LAMTOR2 ortholog. Studies of intracellular trafficking of the NGF receptor TrkA revealed a rapid colocalization with early endosomes, which was modulated by LAMTOR2 siRNA. Inhibition of LAMTOR2 and concomitant destabilization of the remaining members of the LAMTOR complex apparently leads to a faster release of the TrkA/MAPK signaling module and nuclear increase of activated MAPK. These results suggest a modulatory role of the MEK1 adapter protein LAMTOR2 in NGF-mediated MAPK activation required for induction of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells."

We carried out a retrospective study of patients referred to two tertiary cancer centers in South Western Sydney, both of which serve a high proportion of this ethnic minority population. Patients and methods Women who had pathologically node-positive non-metastatic breast cancer (T1-3, N1-3, M0) diagnosed between 2003 and 2006 were studied, with variables of interest being tumor size, number of positive nodes, histological grade, hormone receptor status, age at diagnosis, country of birth and treatment. We compared the Asian and Western subgroups with regard to tumor characteristics, treatment and clinical outcomes. Results A total of 652 eligible patients were identified, with a median follow-up of 6.1 years. Women with Asian backgrounds (n = 125, 20%) were significantly younger at presentation (48 years versus 55 years, p-value <0.0001) and more likely to undergo mastectomy (53% versus 39%, p-value 0.0009) and chemotherapy (86% versus 72%, p-value 0.0063) than their non-Asian counterparts. Tumor stage, grade and receptor status were not statistically different between these two groups. There were also no differences in disease-free survival and overall survival, with medians of 12.7 and 14.8 years respectively. Conclusion Women of Asian background are younger at diagnosis, which may reflect population epidemiology and likely results in higher uptake of chemotherapy. Higher mastectomy rates may be influenced by cultural factors. Future research is warranted to investigate potential differences in tumor biology, psychosocial, economic and cultural factors."

We reported previously that the α9 integrin splicing variant, SFα9, promotes WT α9 integrin-dependent adhesion. In this study, we introduced a new murine α4 integrin splicing variant, α4B, which has a novel short cytoplasmic tail. In inflamed tissues, the expression of α4B, as well as WT α4 integrin, was up-regulated. Cells expressing α4B specifically bound to VCAM-1 but not other α4 integrin ligands, such as fibronectin CS1 or osteopontin. The binding of cells expressing WT α4 integrin to α4 integrin ligands is inhibited by coexpression of α4B. Knockdown of α4B in metastatic melanoma cell lines results in a significant increase in lung metastasis. Expression levels of WT α4 integrin are unaltered by α4B, with α4B acting as a regulatory subunit for WT α4 integrin by a dominant-negative effect or inhibiting α4 integrin activation."
https://openalex.org/W2080515802,"The Extended Logistic Model (ELM) has been previously shown to adequately describe seasonal biomass production and N removal with respect to applied N for several types of annuals and perennials. In this analysis, data from a corn (Zea mays L.) study with variable applied N were analyzed to test hypotheses that certain parameters in the ELM are invariant with respect to site specific attributes, like environmental conditions and soil type. Invariance to environmental conditions suggests such parameters may be functions of the crop characteristics and certain other management practices alone (like plant population, planting date, harvest date). The first parameter analyzed was Δb, the difference between the N uptake shifting parameter and the biomass shifting parameter. The second parameter tested was Ncm, the maximum N concentration. Both parameters were shown to be statistically invariant, despite soil and site differences. This was determined using analysis of variance with normalized nonlinear regression of the ELM on the data from the study. This analysis lends further evidence that there are common parameters involved in the ELM that do not rely on site-specific or situation-specific factors. More insight into the derivation of, definition of, and logic behind the various parameters involved in the model are also given in this paper."
