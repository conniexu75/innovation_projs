https://openalex.org/W4213366162,"The human brain vasculature is of great medical importance: its dysfunction causes disability and death1, and the specialized structure it forms—the blood–brain barrier—impedes the treatment of nearly all brain disorders2,3. Yet so far, we have no molecular map of the human brain vasculature. Here we develop vessel isolation and nuclei extraction for sequencing (VINE-seq) to profile the major vascular and perivascular cell types of the human brain through 143,793 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 25 hippocampus and cortex samples of 9 individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and 8 individuals with no cognitive impairment. We identify brain-region- and species-enriched genes and pathways. We reveal molecular principles of human arteriovenous organization, recapitulating a gradual endothelial and punctuated mural cell continuum. We discover two subtypes of human pericytes, marked by solute transport and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization; and define perivascular versus meningeal fibroblast specialization. In Alzheimer’s disease, we observe selective vulnerability of ECM-maintaining pericytes and gene expression patterns that implicate dysregulated blood flow. With an expanded survey of brain cell types, we find that 30 of the top 45 genes that have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease risk by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are expressed in the human brain vasculature, and we confirm this by immunostaining. Vascular GWAS genes map to endothelial protein transport, adaptive immune and ECM pathways. Many are microglia-specific in mice, suggesting a partial evolutionary transfer of Alzheimer’s disease risk. Our work uncovers the molecular basis of the human brain vasculature, which will inform our understanding of overall brain health, disease and therapy. A method called vessel isolation and nuclei extraction for sequencing (VINE-seq) produces a molecular map of vascular and perivascular cell types in the human brain and reveals their contributions to Alzheimer’s disease risk."

However, antibody trajectories and the associated duration of protection after a second vaccine dose remain unclear. In this study, we investigated anti-spike IgG antibody responses and correlates of protection after second doses of ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the United Kingdom general population. In 222,493 individuals, we found significant boosting of anti-spike IgG by the second doses of both vaccines in all ages and using different dosing intervals, including the 3-week interval for BNT162b2. After second vaccination, BNT162b2 generated higher peak levels than ChAdOX1. Older individuals and males had lower peak levels with BNT162b2 but not ChAdOx1, whereas declines were similar across ages and sexes with ChAdOX1 or BNT162b2. Prior infection significantly increased antibody peak level and half-life with both vaccines. Anti-spike IgG levels were associated with protection from infection after vaccination and, to an even greater degree, after prior infection. At least 67% protection against infection was estimated to last for 2-3 months after two ChAdOx1 doses, for 5-8 months after two BNT162b2 doses in those without prior infection and for 1-2 years for those unvaccinated after natural infection. A third booster dose might be needed, prioritized to ChAdOx1 recipients and those more clinically vulnerable."
https://openalex.org/W4213093937,"Integration of sensory and molecular inputs from the environment shapes animal behaviour. A major site of exposure to environmental molecules is the gastrointestinal tract, in which dietary components are chemically transformed by the microbiota1 and gut-derived metabolites are disseminated to all organs, including the brain2. In mice, the gut microbiota impacts behaviour3, modulates neurotransmitter production in the gut and brain4,5, and influences brain development and myelination patterns6,7. The mechanisms that mediate the gut–brain interactions remain poorly defined, although they broadly involve humoral or neuronal connections. We previously reported that the levels of the microbial metabolite 4-ethylphenyl sulfate (4EPS) were increased in a mouse model of atypical neurodevelopment8. Here we identified biosynthetic genes from the gut microbiome that mediate the conversion of dietary tyrosine to 4-ethylphenol (4EP), and bioengineered gut bacteria to selectively produce 4EPS in mice. 4EPS entered the brain and was associated with changes in region-specific activity and functional connectivity. Gene expression signatures revealed altered oligodendrocyte function in the brain, and 4EPS impaired oligodendrocyte maturation in mice and decreased oligodendrocyte–neuron interactions in ex vivo brain cultures. Mice colonized with 4EP-producing bacteria exhibited reduced myelination of neuronal axons. Altered myelination dynamics in the brain have been associated with behavioural outcomes7,9–14. Accordingly, we observed that mice exposed to 4EPS displayed anxiety-like behaviours, and pharmacological treatments that promote oligodendrocyte differentiation prevented the behavioural effects of 4EPS. These findings reveal that a gut-derived molecule influences complex behaviours in mice through effects on oligodendrocyte function and myelin patterning in the brain. The gut-derived molecule 4-ethylphenol influences complex behaviours in mice through effects on oligodendrocyte function and myelin patterning in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W4212766367,"Despite the importance of the cerebrovasculature in maintaining normal brain physiology and in understanding neurodegeneration and drug delivery to the central nervous system1, human cerebrovascular cells remain poorly characterized owing to their sparsity and dispersion. Here we perform single-cell characterization of the human cerebrovasculature using both ex vivo fresh tissue experimental enrichment and post mortem in silico sorting of human cortical tissue samples. We capture 16,681 cerebrovascular nuclei across 11 subtypes, including endothelial cells, mural cells and three distinct subtypes of perivascular fibroblast along the vasculature. We uncover human-specific expression patterns along the arteriovenous axis and determine previously uncharacterized cell-type-specific markers. We use these human-specific signatures to study changes in 3,945 cerebrovascular cells from patients with Huntington’s disease, which reveal activation of innate immune signalling in vascular and glial cell types and a concomitant reduction in the levels of proteins critical for maintenance of blood–brain barrier integrity. Finally, our study provides a comprehensive molecular atlas of the human cerebrovasculature to guide future biological and therapeutic studies. A study describes single-cell characterization of the human cerebrovasculature, revealing human-specific transcriptomic signatures and providing insights into transcriptional changes associated with Huntington’s disease."

https://openalex.org/W4220944763,"Oligodendrocytes that survive demyelination can remyelinate, including in multiple sclerosis (MS), but how they do so is unclear. In this study, using zebrafish, we found that surviving oligodendrocytes make few new sheaths and frequently mistarget new myelin to neuronal cell bodies, a pathology we also found in MS. In contrast, oligodendrocytes generated after demyelination make abundant and correctly targeted sheaths, indicating that they likely also have a better regenerative potential in MS. Neely et al. investigated the regeneration of different oligodendrocytes after demyelination. They found that newly generated cells exhibit much more proficient remyelination than those that survive demyelination, with implications for MS."
https://openalex.org/W4213254649,"Metabolic characteristics of adult stem cells are distinct from their differentiated progeny, and cellular metabolism is emerging as a potential driver of cell fate conversions1–4. How these metabolic features are established remains unclear. Here we identified inherited metabolism imposed by functionally distinct mitochondrial age-classes as a fate determinant in asymmetric division of epithelial stem-like cells. While chronologically old mitochondria support oxidative respiration, the electron transport chain of new organelles is proteomically immature and they respire less. After cell division, selectively segregated mitochondrial age-classes elicit a metabolic bias in progeny cells, with oxidative energy metabolism promoting differentiation in cells that inherit old mitochondria. Cells that inherit newly synthesized mitochondria with low levels of Rieske iron–sulfur polypeptide 1 have a higher pentose phosphate pathway activity, which promotes de novo purine biosynthesis and redox balance, and is required to maintain stemness during early fate determination after division. Our results demonstrate that fate decisions are susceptible to intrinsic metabolic bias imposed by selectively inherited mitochondria. Döhla et al. show that selectively and asymmetrically inherited mitochondria impose a metabolic bias on progeny in mammary stem-like cells that alters the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4213232054,"Base editing can be applied to characterize single nucleotide variants of unknown function, yet defining effective combinations of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and base editors remains challenging. Here, we describe modular base-editing-activity 'sensors' that link sgRNAs and cognate target sites in cis and use them to systematically measure the editing efficiency and precision of thousands of sgRNAs paired with functionally distinct base editors. By quantifying sensor editing across >200,000 editor-sgRNA combinations, we provide a comprehensive resource of sgRNAs for introducing and interrogating cancer-associated single nucleotide variants in multiple model systems. We demonstrate that sensor-validated tools streamline production of in vivo cancer models and that integrating sensor modules in pooled sgRNA libraries can aid interpretation of high-throughput base editing screens. Using this approach, we identify several previously uncharacterized mutant TP53 alleles as drivers of cancer cell proliferation and in vivo tumor development. We anticipate that the framework described here will facilitate the functional interrogation of cancer variants in cell and animal models."
https://openalex.org/W4212796503,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by hallmark behaviors involving reduced communication and social interaction as well as repetitive activities and restricted interests. ASD represents a broad spectrum, from minimally affected individuals to those requiring intense support, with additional manifestations often including anxiety, irritability/aggression and altered sensory processing. Gastrointestinal (GI) issues are also common in ASD, and studies have identified changes in the gut microbiome of individuals with ASD compared to control populations, complementing recent findings of differences in gut-derived metabolites in feces and circulation. However, a role for the GI tract or microbiome in ASD remains controversial. Here we report that an oral GI-restricted adsorbent (AB-2004) that has affinity for small aromatic or phenolic molecules relieves anxiety-like behaviors that are driven by a gut microbial metabolite in mice. Accordingly, a pilot human study was designed and completed to evaluate the safety of AB-2004 in an open-label, single-cohort, multiple-ascending-dose clinical trial that enrolled 30 adolescents with ASD and GI symptoms in New Zealand and Australia. AB-2004 was shown to have good safety and tolerability across all dose levels, and no drug-related serious adverse events were identified. Significant reductions in specific urinary and plasma levels of gut bacterial metabolites were observed between baseline and end of AB-2004 treatment, demonstrating likely target engagement. Furthermore, we observed improvements in multiple exploratory behavioral endpoints, most significantly in post hoc analysis of anxiety and irritability, as well as GI health, after 8 weeks of treatment. These results from an open-label study (trial registration no. ACTRN12618001956291) suggest that targeting gut-derived metabolites with an oral adsorbent is a safe and well-tolerated approach to improving symptoms associated with ASD, thereby emboldening larger placebo-controlled trials."
https://openalex.org/W4213081908,"We recently reported the discovery of a lysine-cysteine redox switch in proteins with a covalent nitrogen-oxygen-sulfur (NOS) bridge. Here, a systematic survey of the whole protein structure database discloses that NOS bridges are ubiquitous redox switches in proteins of all domains of life and are found in diverse structural motifs and chemical variants. In several instances, lysines are observed in simultaneous linkage with two cysteines, forming a sulfur-oxygen-nitrogen-oxygen-sulfur (SONOS) bridge with a trivalent nitrogen, which constitutes an unusual native branching cross-link. In many proteins, the NOS switch contains a functionally essential lysine with direct roles in enzyme catalysis or binding of substrates, DNA or effectors, linking lysine chemistry and redox biology as a regulatory principle. NOS/SONOS switches are frequently found in proteins from human and plant pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and also in many human proteins with established roles in gene expression, redox signaling and homeostasis in physiological and pathophysiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4213112830,"Achiral sulfur functional groups, such as sulfonamide, sulfone, thiol and thioether, are common in drugs and natural products. By contrast, chiral sulfur functional groups are often neglected as pharmacophores1–3, although sulfoximine, with its unique physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties4,5, has been recently incorporated into several clinical candidates. Thus, other sulfur stereogenic centres, such as sulfinate ester, sulfinamide, sulfonimidate ester and sulfonimidamide, have started to attract attention. The diversity and complexity of these sulfur stereogenic centres have the potential to expand the chemical space for drug discovery6–10. However, the installation of these structures enantioselectively into drug molecules is highly challenging. Here we report straightforward access to enantioenriched sulfinate esters via asymmetric condensation of prochiral sulfinates and alcohols using pentanidium as an organocatalyst. We successfully coupled a wide range of sulfinates and bioactive alcohols stereoselectively. The initial sulfinates can be prepared from existing sulfone and sulfonamide drugs, and the resulting sulfinate esters are versatile for transformations to diverse chiral sulfur pharmacophores. Through late-stage diversification11,12 of celecoxib and other drug derivatives, we demonstrate the viability of this unified approach towards sulfur stereogenic centres. A synthetic strategy for the stereoselective preparation of sulfinate esters and related sulfur stereogenic centres via asymmetric condensation expands the drug discovery toolbox for these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W4213292121,"The accumulation of deleterious mitochondrial DNA (∆mtDNA) causes inherited mitochondrial diseases and ageing-associated decline in mitochondrial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation. Following mitochondrial perturbations, the bZIP protein ATFS-1 induces a transcriptional programme to restore mitochondrial function. Paradoxically, ATFS-1 is also required to maintain ∆mtDNAs in heteroplasmic worms. The mechanism by which ATFS-1 promotes ∆mtDNA accumulation relative to wild-type mtDNAs is unclear. Here we show that ATFS-1 accumulates in dysfunctional mitochondria. ATFS-1 is absent in healthy mitochondria owing to degradation by the mtDNA-bound protease LONP-1, which results in the nearly exclusive association between ATFS-1 and ∆mtDNAs in heteroplasmic worms. Moreover, we demonstrate that mitochondrial ATFS-1 promotes the binding of the mtDNA replicative polymerase (POLG) to ∆mtDNAs. Interestingly, inhibition of the mtDNA-bound protease LONP-1 increased ATFS-1 and POLG binding to wild-type mtDNAs. LONP-1 inhibition in Caenorhabditis elegans and human cybrid cells improved the heteroplasmy ratio and restored oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that ATFS-1 promotes mtDNA replication in dysfunctional mitochondria by promoting POLG–mtDNA binding, which is antagonized by LONP-1. Yang et al. report that ATFS-1 preferentially accumulates in dysfunctional mitochondria carrying mutated mitochondria DNA (∆mtDNA) and facilitates mtDNA replication by promoting POLG recruitment, resulting in the replicative advantage of ∆mtDNA and heteroplasmy maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W4211100855,"ORF8 is an accessory protein encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Consensus regarding the biological functions of ORF8 is lacking, largely because the fundamental characteristics of this protein in cells have not been determined. To clarify these features, we herein established an ORF8 expression system in 293T cells. Using this system, approximately 41% of the ORF8 expressed in 293T cells were secreted extracellularly as a glycoprotein homodimer with inter/intramolecular disulfide bonds. Intracellular ORF8 was sensitive to the glycosidase Endo H, whereas the secreted portion was Endo-H-resistant, suggesting that secretion occurs via a conventional pathway. Additionally, immunoblotting analysis showed that the total amounts of the major histocompatibility complex class Ι (MHC-I), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and SARS-CoV-2 spike (CoV-2 S) proteins coexpressed in cells were not changed by the increased ORF8 expression, although FACS analysis revealed that the expression of the cell surface MHC-I protein, but not that of ACE2 and CoV-2 S proteins, was reduced by ORF8 expression. Finally, we demonstrate by RNA-seq analysis that ORF8 had no significant stimulatory effects in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Taken together, our results provide fundamental evidence that the ORF8 glycoprotein acts as a secreted homodimer, and its functions are likely associated with the intracellular transport and/or extracellular signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4213215410,"Using the statistical data of 280 prefectural-level cities in China from 2011 to 2020, this paper empirically tests the relationship between digital finance and residents' income in a linear and nonlinear model based on the G-J model theory, respectively. The study aims to discuss and analyze the impact of digital finance development on income distribution in the context of the current situation of digital finance development in China and further explore how to make digital finance better regulate the income distribution of residents. The innovation of this paper is to use two nonlinear methods to verify the Kuznets effect and threshold characteristics of digital financial development affecting the income distribution of residents based on linear analysis and explore the relationship between n digital economic development the current income gap more comprehensively. The study shows a Kuznets effect of digital finance development on the income distribution of Chinese residents. Thus, most regions in China have not yet crossed the inflection point of the bell-shaped curve, and the income gap within areas will continue to increase with the development of digital finance. By constructing a threshold model, it is found that the positive effect of digital finance on income disparity may initially increase with the increase of regional economic level. Still, when the regional economic development reaches a higher stage, the effect will tend to fall back. As a result, the negative impact of digital finance development on residents' income distribution will be significantly reduced at that time."
https://openalex.org/W4212834056,"Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that sense intracellular danger signals and induce pyroptosis. CARD8 and NLRP1 are related inflammasomes that are repressed by the enzymatic activities and protein structures of the dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8/9). Potent DPP8/9 inhibitors such as Val-boroPro (VbP) activate both NLRP1 and CARD8, but chemical probes that selectively activate only one have not been identified. Here we report a small molecule called CQ31 that selectively activates CARD8. CQ31 inhibits the M24B aminopeptidases prolidase (PEPD) and Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase 1 (XPNPEP1), leading to the accumulation of proline-containing peptides that inhibit DPP8/9 and thereby activate CARD8. NLRP1 is distinct from CARD8 in that it directly contacts DPP8/9's active site; these proline-containing peptides, unlike VbP, do not disrupt this repressive interaction and thus do not activate NLRP1. We expect that CQ31 will now become a valuable tool to study CARD8 biology."
https://openalex.org/W4213229403,"The excess of the chemical fertilizers not only causes the environmental pollution but also has many deteriorating effects including global warming and alteration of soil microbial diversity. In conventional researches, chemical fertilizers and their concentrations are selected based on the knowledge of experts involved in the projects, which this kind of models are usually subjective. Therefore, the present study aimed to introduce the optimal concentrations of three macro elements including nitrogen (0, 100, and 200 g), potassium (0, 100, 200, and 300 g), and magnesium (0, 50, and 100 g) on fruit yield (FY), fruit length (FL), and number of rows per spike (NRPS) of greenhouse banana using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc LSD test and two well-known artificial neural networks (ANNs) including multilayer perceptron (MLP) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). According to the results of ANOVA, the highest mean value of the FY was obtained with 200 g of N, 300 g of K, and 50 g of Mg. Based on the results of the present study, the both ANNs models had high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.66-0.99) in the both training and testing data for the FY, FL, and NRPS. However, the GRNN model had better performance than MLP model for modeling and predicting the three characters of greenhouse banana. Therefore, genetic algorithm (GA) was subjected to the GRNN model in order to find the optimal amounts of N, K, and Mg for achieving the high amounts of the FY, FL, and NRPS. The GRNN-GA hybrid model confirmed that high yield of the plant could be achieved by reducing chemical fertilizers including nitrogen, potassium, and magnesium by 65, 44, and 62%, respectively, in compared to traditional method."
https://openalex.org/W4211073893,"Heterogeneity within the glycocalyx influences cell adhesion mechanics and signaling. However, the role of specific glycosylation subtypes in influencing cell mechanics via alterations of receptor function remains unexplored. It has been shown that the addition of sialic acid to terminal glycans impacts growth, development, and cancer progression. In addition, the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-I promotes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity, and we have shown EGFR is an 'allosteric mechano-organizer' of integrin tension. Here, we investigated the impact of ST6Gal-I on cell mechanics. Using DNA-based tension gauge tether probes of variable thresholds, we found that high ST6Gal-I activity promotes increased integrin forces and spreading in Cos-7 and OVCAR3, OVCAR5, and OV4 cancer cells. Further, employing inhibitors and function-blocking antibodies against β1, β3, and β5 integrins and ST6Gal-I targets EGFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor, and Fas cell surface death receptor, we validated that the observed phenotypes are EGFR-specific. We found that while tension, contractility, and adhesion are extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway-dependent, spreading, proliferation, and invasion are phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt serine/threonine kinase dependent. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, we also show that high ST6Gal-I activity leads to sustained EGFR membrane retention, making it a key regulator of cell mechanics. Our findings suggest a novel sialylation-dependent mechanism orchestrating cellular mechanics and enhancing cell motility via EGFR signaling."

Regression analyses were conducted to identify the predictors of workplace stress, psychological distress, and post-traumatic stress.Hospital workers employed at 4 teaching and 8 non-teaching hospitals in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic.Among 1875 respondents (84% female, 49% frontline workers), 72% feared falling ill, 64% felt their job placed them at great risk of COVID-19 exposure, and 48% felt little control over the risk of infection. Respondents perceived that others avoided them (61%), reported increased workplace stress (80%), workload (66%) and responsibilities (59%), and 44% considered leaving their job. The psychological questionnaires revealed that 25% had at least some psychological distress on the K10, 50% had IES-R scores suggesting clinical concern for post-traumatic stress, and 38% fulfilled criteria for at least one psychological diagnosis. Female gender and feeling at increased risk due to PPE predicted all adverse psychological outcomes. Respondents favoured clear hospital communication (59%), knowing their voice is heard (55%), expressions of appreciation from leadership (55%), having COVID-19 protocols (52%), and food and beverages provided by the hospital (50%).Hospital work during the COVID-19 pandemic has had important personal, professional, and psychological impacts.

https://openalex.org/W4213285545,"This study evaluated differences in the clinical appearance of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on plasma level and regulation of microRNAs (miRNA-29c, miRNA-21, and miRNA-155). The observational-analytical study with a cross-sectional design was conducted on 36 HCC patients and 36 healthy controls. The blood samples were collected from 2 Province Hospitals (Dr. Sardjito Hospital and Prof. Dr. Margono Soekarjo Hospital) for HCC and the Blood Bank Donor of the Indonesian Red Cross for 36 healthy controls. These blood samples were treated as follows: plasma isolation, RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, quantification by qRT-PCR using a sequence-specific forward primer, and normalization of miRNA using housekeeping-stably miRNA-16. There were only 27 HCC patients with complete clinical variables (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), platelet count, albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cholinesterase (ChE)) that were able to analyses for regulation miRNAs based on its fold change expression miRNA target. All 27 HCC subjects were follow-up until 3-years of monitoring for their overall survival. The miRNA plasma expression was analyzed by Bio-Rad CFX 96 Manager software to determine the cycle of quantification, followed by the calculation of expression levels using Livak’s methods. Data were analyzed using STATA 11.0, with a significant value of p&lt;0.05. The miRNAs expression of HCC subjects were lower than that healthy control subjects in miRNA-29c (down-regulation 1.83-fold), higher than that healthy control subjects in miRNA 21 and miRNA-155 (up-regulation, 1.74-fold; 1.55-fold) respectively. NLR, CRP, ChE, and platelet count showed a significant difference in miRNA-29c regulation, though neutrophil count showed a significant difference in miRNA-21 and miRNA-155 regulation (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Plasma biomarkers: miRNA-21 and miRNA-155 might be potential biomarkers as onco-miR in HCC subjects, while miRNA-29c might act as a tumor suppressor. Significant evidence was identified with clinical progression based on the regulation of miRNAs, which was consistent with miRNA -29c."
https://openalex.org/W4212864813,"The significance of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) in gastric cancer (GC) has been studied predominantly in Asian patient cohorts. Data on White patients are scarce. Here, we aimed to independently validate the expression and putative tumor biological significance of FGFR2 in a large non-Asian GC cohort. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on large-area tissue sections from 493 patients with GC and evaluated using the HScore. GCs with moderate and strong FGFR2 expression were studied for Fgfr2 amplification using chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). Median overall survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. The majority [240 (99.1%)] of FGFR2-positive GCs showed a variable combination of staining intensities with marked intratumoral heterogeneity, including weak [198 (40.2%) cases], moderate [145 (29.4%)], and strong [108 (21.9%)] staining in diverse combinations. 250 (50.9%) GCs expressed no FGFR2. Fgfr2 gene amplification was found in 40% of selected cases with high protein expression and was also heterogeneous at the cell level. FGFR2 protein expression did not correlate with patient survival in the entire cohort However, using different cutoff values, a negative correlation between FGFR2-expression and patient outcome was found for diffuse-type GC. FGFR2 expression was associated with a lower tumor grade and intestinal phenotype (p≤0.0001). FGFR2-positive diffuse-type GCs classify a small subset of patients with a poor tumor specific survival (5.29±1.3 vs. 14.67±1.9 months; p = 0.004)."
https://openalex.org/W4213304518,"Only a few recent reports have examined longitudinal adherence patterns in US clinics and its impact on immunological and virological outcomes among large cohorts initiating contemporary antiretroviral therapy (ART) in US clinics.We followed all persons with HIV (PLWH) in a California clinic population initiating ART between 2010 and 2017. We estimated longitudinal adherence for each PLWH by calculating the medication possession ratio within multiple 6-month intervals using pharmacy refill records.During the study, 2315 PWLH were followed for a median time of 210.8 weeks and only 179 (7.7%) were lost-to-follow-up. The mean adherence was 84.9%. Age (Hazard Ratio (HR): (95% confidence interval): 1.25 (1.20-1.31) per 10-year increase) and Black race (HR: 0.62 (0.53-0.73) vs. White) were associated with adherence in the cohort. A 10% percent increase in adherence increased the odds of being virally suppressed by 37% (OR and 95% CI: 1.37 [1.33-1.41]) and was associated with an increase in mean CD4 count by 8.54 cells/ul in the next 6-month interval (p-value <0.0001).Our study shows that despite large improvements in retention in care, demographic disparities in adherence to ART persist. Adherence was lower among younger patients and black patients. Our study confirmed the strong association between adherence to ART and viral suppression but could only establish a weak association between adherence and CD4 count. These findings reaffirm the importance of adherence and retention in care and further highlight the need for tailored patient-centered HIV Care Models as a strategy to improve PLWH's outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4211244868,"Endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is an important source of myofibroblasts, but also contributes to the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). By several differential gene expression analyses from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, the tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) gene, known as a tumor suppressor, was shown to be dysregulated in DN; however, the potential role and regulatory mechanism of TFPI2 in DN are unclear. Here, we found abnormal upregulation of TFPI2 in the renal cortex of diabetic mice, accompanied by impaired renal function. We also injected a single dose of adeno-associated virus (AAV)2 carrying shRNA targeting TFPI2 intravenously into these mice and found that knockdown of TFPI2 improved renal function and reduced renal fibrosis and cell apoptosis in experimental DN. Furthermore, hyperglycemia-induced EndMT was inhibited in the absence of TFPI2, as evidenced by increased expression of endothelial markers (VE-cadherin and CD31) and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers (α-SMA, desmin, and FSP-1). To further explore the mechanism in vitro, human renal glomerular endothelial cells (hRGECs) were incubated in the presence of high glucose or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)2. TFPI2 deficiency inhibited high glucose-induced cell apoptosis and TGF-β2-induced EndMT in hRGECs, while overexpression of TFPI2 had the opposite effects. Importantly, TGF-β2 is a crucial driver of EndMT, and we found that TFPI2 promoted TGF-β2/Smad signaling activation by interferring the interaction of TGF-β pathway regulators (SMURF2 with SMAD7). Our results show that TFPI2 regulates EndMT and the TGF-β2 signaling pathway and is a potential promoter of DN pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4212831977,"Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) is known to play a key role in autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTE). The ADLTE is an inherited disease characterized by focal seizures with distinctive auditory or aphasic symptoms. A large number of mutations on the Lgi1 gene have been reported and are believed to be the genetic cause for ADLTE. We identified a novel missense mutation, c.152A>G (p.Asp51Gly), on Lgi1 from a Chinese ADLTE patient who manifests locomotor imbalance and white matter reduction. However, it remains unknown how mutant LGI1 causes white matter abnormalities at molecular and cellular levels. Here, we generated a knock-in mouse bearing this Lgi1 mutation. We found that Lgi1D51G/D51G mice exhibited impaired defective white matter and motor coordination. We observed that Lgi1D51G/D51G mice displayed a reduced number of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) and deficient OL differentiation in the white matter. However, the population of oligodendrocyte precursor cells was not affected in Lgi1D51G/D51G mice. Mechanistically, we showed that the Lgi1D51G mutation resulted in altered mTOR signaling and led to decreased levels of Sox10. Given that Sox10 is a key transcriptional factor to control OL differentiation, our results strongly suggest that the Lgi1D51G mutation may cause white matter abnormalities via inhibiting Sox10-dependent OL differentiation and myelination in the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W4212843858,"Introduction Internal migration is essential to understand the population dynamics and the multifaceted relationship between population and development of a nation. In Bangladesh, the study of international migration is more frequent due to its socioeconomic importance and data availability. However, the study of internal migration is less frequent as there lie complexities in measuring internal migration, and data are less available. Thus, this paper aimed to explore the dynamics of internal in Bangladesh. Data and methods We utilized data from the Bangladesh Population and Housing Census 1991–2011. The number of internal migrants was estimated using the United Nations Manual on Methods of Measuring Internal Migration- Manual VI . District-wise lifetime and net internal migration rate were the dependent variables where several socioeconomic variables were used as independent variables. The correlation and the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis were employed. Results Dhaka, Gazipur, Narayanganj, and all the Divisional cities have the highest in-migration rate, whereas the northern and southern districts of Bangladesh have the highest out-migration rate. The regression model showed that activity rate appeared to be the strongest predictor (β = 0.419, P&lt;0.001) of net migration for 2011, followed by city corporation (β = 0.275, P&lt;0.01) and poverty rate (β = -0.246, P&lt;0.01). However, the lifetime internal migration rate was 9.8% in 2011. The pooled model (1991–2011) for lifetime internal migration showed that activity rate (β = 0.408, P&lt;0.001), population density (β = 0.386, P&lt;0.001), literacy rate (β = 0.341, P&lt;0.001), and city corporation (β = 0.139, P&lt;0.01) were the significant factors of internal migration. Marriage, looking for a job, employment/business, education, and natural calamities were the reasons for internal migration. Discussion and conclusion The destinations of migrants are few developed and urbanized cities which needs particular attention in policy planning. If the current migration trends continue, few cities will have an excessive population, which will increase density and pollution, thereby decreasing living standards. Thus, along with comprehensive urban planning, decentralization of government and private institutions must be ensured. Since the rural to urban migration rate is high, the findings recommend more development and concentration in the rural area. Finally, education, training, and work opportunities for migrants should be safeguarded in the area of origin."
https://openalex.org/W4212847753,"With a few exceptions, musical taste has been researched via likes or preferences of certain types of music. The present study focuses on disliked music and takes a broad approach to cover explanatory strategies related to personal dislikes.In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 participants in five age groups. Interviewees were asked to prepare a list of their disliked music, and for each item they were asked about the reasons for the dislike. To ensure that the complexity and range of the participants' dislikes and rationales were captured in the analysis, a structuring content analysis as a mostly theory-driven approach was combined with inductive category creation out of the interview data.The most often mentioned type of dislike was musical style, followed by artist and genre. Five main reference points were identified for describing musical dislikes: the music itself, lyrics, performance, artist, and the people who listen to it. The identified rationales for disliked music were assigned to three larger categories: object-related reasons, such as music-compositional aspects, aesthetic dichotomies or lyrics; subject-related reasons, such as emotional or bodily effects, or discrepancies with the self-image; social reasons, which refer to one's social environment and the taste judgments common to it (in-group) or to other groups of which the participants do not feel part of (out-group). Apart from the rationales for disliked music, the participants described specific reactions when they are confronted with their disliked music, such as emotional, physical, and social reactions.While musical dislikes have already been shown to fulfill important social functions, the current study extends the rationales to music-related and self-related reasons. Musical dislikes fulfill similar functions to liked music, such as preservation of a good mood, identity expression and construction, strengthening of group cohesion as well as social distinction."
https://openalex.org/W4213040027,"Ticks are of great menace to animal and human health. They serve as vectors to both animals and human pathogens including Rickettsia species. Tick-borne rickettsiosis in West Africa remains incompletely understood. We determined the prevalence of tick infestation among small ruminants and molecularly described a clinically significant spotted fever Rickettsia massiliae from Rhipicephalus ticks collected from North-Central, Nigeria. A total of 352 small ruminants comprising of 152 sheep and 200 goats that were brought for slaughter at the major small ruminant slaughterhouse in Ilorin were examined for the presence of ticks. The collected Rhipicephalus species were subjected to molecular studies to detect and characterize Rickettsia massiliae. Of the small ruminants examined, 21 sheep and 46 goats were infested with ticks representing 13.82% and 23.00% respectively. Eight and nine different species of ticks were detected in sheep and goats respectively, with Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus being the most prevalent tick species in both sheep and goats. There was a significant difference (p <0.01) in the prevalence of the different tick species collected in sheep and in goats. Based on the PCR amplification of the 23S-5S intergenic spacer (IGS), only 2 of the 142 Rhipicephalus tick samples screened for R. massiliae were positive (1.41%; 95% CI = 0.39-4.99). Rickettsia massiliae was detected from Rhipicephalus turanicus collected from sheep. Sequences obtained from the PCR carried out by amplifying Rickettsia 23S-5S IGS showed 99-100% close identity with members of the R. massiliae group. This study has for the first time confirmed the presence of spotted fever group Rickettsia massiliae from feeding ticks in Nigerian small ruminants. Further investigations to determine the possible pathogenic role of human R. massiliae infection in Nigeria would be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W4213230142,"We analyse standard confidence intervals for the mean of a finite population, with a view to sample size determination. We first consider a standard method for sample size determination based on the assumption of knowledge of the population variance parameter. We then consider the more realistic case where the population variance is treated as an unknown, and we derive a new method of sample size determination that accounts for the uncertainty in this parameter. We develop a sample size calculation method based on a preliminary sample of data which allows us to increase the accuracy of our inference by some specified amount with a specified level of confidence. We compare this method to the standard method."
https://openalex.org/W4213379516,"The mining industry production is an important pillar industry in China, while its extensive production activities have led to several ecological and environmental problems. Earth observation technology using high-resolution satellite imagery can help us efficiently obtain information on surface elements, surveying and monitoring various land occupation issues arising from open-pit mining production activities. Conventional pixel-based interpretation methods for high-resolution remote sensing images are restricted by “salt and pepper” noise caused by environmental factors, making it difficult to meet increasing requirements for monitoring accuracy. With the Jingxiang phosphorus mining area in Jingmen Hubei Province as the studied area, this paper uses a multi-scale segmentation algorithm to extract large-scale main characteristic information using a layered mask method based on the hierarchical structure of the image object. The remaining characteristic elements were classified and extracted in combination with the random forest model and characteristic factors to obtain land occupation information related mining industry production, which was compared with the results of the Classification and Regression Tree model. 23 characteristic factors in three aspects were selected, including spectral, geometric and texture characteristics. The methods employed in this study achieved 86% and 0.78 respectively in overall extraction accuracy analysis and the Kappa coefficient analysis, compared to 79% and 0.68 using the conventional method."
https://openalex.org/W4211156092,"A wide range of protein acyl modifications has been identified on enzymes across various metabolic processes; however, the impact of these modifications remains poorly understood. Protein glutarylation is a recently identified modification that can be nonenzymatically driven by glutaryl-CoA. In mammalian systems, this unique metabolite is only produced in the lysine and tryptophan oxidative pathways. To better understand the biology of protein glutarylation, we studied the relationship between enzymes within the lysine/tryptophan catabolic pathways, protein glutarylation, and regulation by the deglutarylating enzyme sirtuin 5 (SIRT5). Here, we identify glutarylation on the lysine oxidation pathway enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) and show increased GCDH glutarylation when glutaryl-CoA production is stimulated by lysine catabolism. Our data reveal that glutarylation of GCDH impacts its function, ultimately decreasing lysine oxidation. We also demonstrate the ability of SIRT5 to deglutarylate GCDH, restoring its enzymatic activity. Finally, metabolomic and bioinformatic analyses indicate an expanded role for SIRT5 in regulating amino acid metabolism. Together, these data support a feedback loop model within the lysine/tryptophan oxidation pathway in which glutaryl-CoA is produced, in turn inhibiting GCDH function via glutaryl modification of GCDH lysine residues and can be relieved by SIRT5 deacylation activity."
https://openalex.org/W4213067159,"Usually, official and survey-based statistics guide policymakers in their choice of response instruments to economic crises. However, in an early phase, after a sudden and unforeseen shock has caused unexpected and fast-changing dynamics, data from traditional statistics are only available with non-negligible time delays. This leaves policymakers uncertain about how to most effectively manage their economic countermeasures to support businesses, especially when they need to respond quickly, as in the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this information deficit, we propose a framework that guided policymakers throughout all stages of this unforeseen economic shock by providing timely and reliable sources of firm-level data as a basis to make informed policy decisions. We do so by combining early stage 'ad hoc' web analyses, 'follow-up' business surveys, and 'retrospective' analyses of firm outcomes. A particular focus of our framework is on assessing the early effects of the pandemic, using highly dynamic and large-scale data from corporate websites. Most notably, we show that textual references to the coronavirus pandemic published on a large sample of company websites and state-of-the-art text analysis methods allowed to capture the heterogeneity of the pandemic's effects at a very early stage and entailed a leading indication on later movements in firm credit ratings. While the proposed framework is specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration of results obtained from real-time online sources in the design of subsequent surveys and their value in forecasting firm-level outcomes typically targeted by policy measures, is a first step towards a more timely and holistic approach for policy guidance in times of economic shocks."
https://openalex.org/W4213306632,"The Monte Carlo method is employed in this study to simulate the proton irradiation of a water-gel phantom. Positron-emitting radionuclides such as 11C, 15O, and 13N are scored using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System Monte Carlo code package. Previously, it was reported that as a result of 16O(p,2p2n)13N nuclear reaction, whose threshold energy is relatively low (5.660 MeV), a 13N peak is formed near the actual Bragg peak. Considering the generated 13N peak, we obtain offset distance values between the 13N peak and the actual Bragg peak for various incident proton energies ranging from 45 to 250 MeV, with an energy interval of 5 MeV. The offset distances fluctuate between 1.0 and 2.0 mm. For example, the offset distances between the 13N peak and the Bragg peak are 2.0, 2.0, and 1.0 mm for incident proton energies of 80, 160, and 240 MeV, respectively. These slight fluctuations for different incident proton energies are due to the relatively stable energy-dependent cross-section data for the 16O(p,2p2n)13N nuclear reaction. Hence, we develop an open-source computer program that performs linear and non-linear interpolations of offset distance data against the incident proton energy, which further reduces the energy interval from 5 to 0.1 MeV. In addition, we perform spectral analysis to reconstruct the 13N Bragg peak, and the results are consistent with those predicted from Monte Carlo computations. Hence, the results are used to generate three-dimensional scatter plots of the 13N radionuclide distribution in the modeled phantom. The obtained results and the developed methodologies will facilitate future investigations into proton range monitoring for therapeutic applications."

We enrolled 61 CHB patients treated with Peg-IFNα-2a weekly for 48 weeks, of whom 12 had a virological response (VR) and 49 did not VR (non-VR). A VR was defined as HBV DNA &lt; 2,000 IU/ml, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative, and nucleos(t)ide analogue free at 48 weeks after the end of treatment. The non-VR group showed a significantly higher HBeAg-positivity rate, ALT, HBV DNA, and serum miR-192-5p levels at baseline ( P = 0.024, P = 0.020, P = 0.007, P = 0.021, respectively). Serum miR-192-5p levels at 24-weeks after the start of treatment were also significantly higher in the non-VR than the VR group ( P = 0.011). Multivariate logistic regression analysis for predicting VR showed that miR-192-5p level at baseline was an independent factor (Odds 4.5, P = 0.041). Serum miR-192-5p levels were significantly correlated with the levels of HBV DNA, hepatitis B core-related antigen, and hepatitis B surface antigen (r = 0.484, 0.384 and 0.759, respectively). The serum miR-192-5p level was useful as a biomarker for the therapeutic efficacy of Peg-IFN in CHB treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4212776751,"The intracellular distribution of copper in the liver has been investigated in dogs and humans. However, this has not been reported in cats. This study aimed to assess the intracellular copper distribution in liver specimens from cats with a range of hepatic copper concentrations. Twenty-nine frozen liver specimens from cats were included. Each liver specimen was divided into two pieces for overall copper quantification and tissue fractionation. The copper concentrations in liver specimens and liver fractions were measured by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Five specimens had copper concentrations &lt; 100 μg/g dry weight, eight had copper concentrations between 100 and 180 μg/g, 14 had copper concentrations between 181 and 700 μg/g, and two had copper concentrations &gt;700 μg/g. Only one specimen had positive copper staining. Regardless of the overall concentrations, copper was mostly found in the cytosolic fraction followed by the nuclear, large granule, and microsomal fractions. Our findings indicate that similarly to other species, intracellular copper is predominantly found in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions in cats. The distribution in cats with copper-loaded conditions, such as primary copper hepatopathy, was not assessed but warrants evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4213061419,"Vision is considered a privileged sensory channel for deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students to learn, and, naturally, they recognize themselves as visual learners. This assumption also seems widespread among schoolteachers, which led us to analyse the intersection between teachers’ beliefs on deaf and hard of hearing students’ academic achievement, visual skills, attentional difficulties, and the perceived importance of image display in class. An online survey was designed to analyse the beliefs of the schoolteachers about the deaf and hard of hearing students learning in educational settings from Portugal and Sweden. Participated 133 teachers, 70 Portuguese and 63 Swedish, from the preschool to the end of mandatory education (ages 3–18) with several years of experience. The content analysis and the computed SPSS statistical significance tests reveal that surveyed teachers believe that deaf and hard of hearing students have better visual skills when compared with their hearing peers yet show divergent beliefs about visual attentional processes. Within the teachers’ perceptions on learning barriers to DHH students, the distractibility and cognitive effort factors were highlighted, among communicational difficulties in class. Conclusions about the prevalence of learning misconceptions in teachers from both countries analysed, corroborate previous studies on neuromyths in education, and bring novelty to Deaf Education field. The work of translation of scientific knowledge, teacher training updating, and partnership between researchers and educators are also urgently needed in special education."
https://openalex.org/W4213091581,"Human leptospirosis involves the classic epidemiological triad (agent, host and environment); hence the investigations should include the knowledge on Leptospira within the animals and the environment. The objectives of this study are to explore the abundance of Leptospira in different climate zones of Sri Lanka and to describe the presence of Leptospira in the same water source at serial time points. First, water and soil samples were collected from different parts of Sri Lanka (Component-1); second, water sampling continued only in the dry zone (Component-2). Finally, serial water sampling from ten open wells was performed at five different time points (Component-3). Quantitative PCR of water and metagenomic sequencing of soil were performed to detect Leptospira . Three replicates for each sample were used for PCR testing, and positive result of two or more replicates was defined as ‘strongly positive,’ and one positive replicate was defined as positive. In the water and soil sample analysis in the whole country (Component-1), two out of 12 water sites were positive, and both were situated in the wet zone. Very small quantities of the genus Leptospira were detected by 16 amplicon analysis of soil in all 11 sites. In the dry zone water sample analysis (Component-2), only samples from 6 out of 26 sites were positive, of which one site was strongly positive. In the serial sample analysis (Component-3), Six, five, four, five, and six wells were positive in serial measurements. All wells were positive for at least one time point, while only one well was positive for all five time points. Proximity to the tank and greater distances from the main road were associated with strong positive results for Leptospira (P&lt;0.05). The presence of Leptospira was not consistent, indicating the variable abundance of Leptospira in the natural environment. This intermittent nature of positivity could be explained by the repetitive contamination by animal urine."
https://openalex.org/W4213334024,"Keloid scars are characterized by the excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and an imbalance between the production and degradation of collagen, leading to its buildup in the dermis. There is no ""gold standard"" treatment for this condition, and the recurrence is frequent after surgical procedures removal. In vitro studies have demonstrated that photobiomodulation (PBM) using the blue wavelength reduces the proliferation speed and the number of fibroblasts as well as the expression of TGF-β. There are no protocols studied and established for the treatment of keloids with blue LED. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the combination of PBM with blue light and the intralesional administration of the corticoid triamcinolone hexacetonide on the quality of the remaining scar by Vancouver Scar Scale in the postoperative period of keloid surgery. A randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial will be conducted involving two groups: 1) Sham (n = 29): intralesional administration of corticoid (IAC) and sham PBM in the preoperative and postoperative periods of keloid removal surgery; and 2) active PBM combined with IAC (n = 29) in the preoperative and postoperative periods of keloid removal surgery. Transcutaneous PBM will be performed on the keloid region in the preoperative period and on the remaining scar in the postoperative period using blue LED (470 nm, 400 mW, 4J per point on 10 linear points). The patients will answer two questionnaires: one for the assessment of quality of life (Qualifibro-UNIFESP) and one for the assessment of satisfaction with the scar (PSAQ). The team of five plastic surgeons will answer the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). All questionnaires will be administered one, three, six, and twelve months postoperatively. The keloids will be molded in silicone prior to the onset of treatment and prior to excision to assess pre-treatment and post-treatment size. The same will be performed for the remaining scar at one, three, six, and twelve months postoperatively. The removed keloid will be submitted to histopathological analysis for the determination of the quantity of fibroblasts, the organization and distribution of collagen (picrosirius staining), and the genic expression of TGF-β (qPCR).

https://openalex.org/W4211202513,"Assembly and budding of the influenza C virus is mediated by three membrane proteins: the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein (HEF), the matrix protein (CM1), and the ion channel (CM2). Here we investigated whether the formation of the hexagonal HEF arrangement, a distinctive feature of influenza C virions is important for virus budding. We used super resolution microscopy and found 250-nm sized HEF clusters at the plasma membrane of transfected cells, which were insensitive to cholesterol extraction and cytochalasin treatment. Overexpression of either CM1, CM2, or HEF caused the release of membrane-enveloped particles. Cryo-electron microscopy of the latter revealed spherical vesicles exhibiting the hexagonal HEF clusters. We subsequently used reverse genetics to identify elements in HEF required for this clustering. We found that deletion of the short cytoplasmic tail of HEF reduced virus titer and hexagonal HEF arrays, suggesting that an interaction with CM1 stabilizes the HEF clusters. In addition, we substituted amino acids at the surface of the closed HEF conformation and identified specific mutations that prevented virus rescue, others reduced virus titers and the number of HEF clusters in virions. Finally, mutation of two regions that mediate contacts between trimers in the in-situ structure of HEF was shown to prevent rescue of infectious virus particles. Mutations at residues thought to mediate lateral interactions were revealed to promote intracellular trafficking defects. Taken together, we propose that lateral interactions between the ectodomains of HEF trimers are a driving force for virus budding, although CM2 and CM1 also play important roles in this process."
https://openalex.org/W4211228709,"If a coronary blood vessel is occluded and the neighboring cardiomyocytes deprived of oxygen, subsequent reperfusion of the ischemic tissue can lead to oxidative damage due to excessive generation of reactive oxygen species. Cardiomyocytes and their mitochondria are the main energy producers and consumers of the heart, and their metabolic changes during ischemia seem to be a key driver of reperfusion injury. Here, we hypothesized that tracking changes in cardiomyocyte metabolism, such as oxygen and ATP concentrations, would help in identifying points of metabolic failure during ischemia and reperfusion. To track some of these changes continuously from the onset of ischemia through reperfusion, we developed a system of differential equations representing the chemical reactions involved in the production and consumption of 67 molecular species. This model was validated and used to identify conditions present during periods of critical transition in ischemia and reperfusion that could lead to oxidative damage. These simulations identified a range of oxygen concentrations that lead to reverse mitochondrial electron transport at complex I of the respiratory chain and a spike in mitochondrial membrane potential, which are key suspects in the generation of reactive oxygen species at the onset of reperfusion. Our model predicts that a short initial reperfusion treatment with reduced oxygen content (5% of physiological levels) could reduce the cellular damage from both of these mechanisms. This model should serve as an open-source platform to test ideas for treatment of the ischemia reperfusion process by following the temporal evolution of molecular concentrations in the cardiomyocyte."
https://openalex.org/W4212889559,"We use German KiGGS data to add to existing knowledge about trends in vaccination-related attitudes and behavior. Looking at vaccinations against measles, we assess whether a low confidence in vaccination and vaccination complacency is particularly prevalent among parents whose children were born somewhat recently, as compared to parents whose children belong to earlier birth cohorts. We further analyze how these attitudes relate to vaccination rates in the corresponding birth cohorts, and which sociodemographic subgroups are more likely to have vaccination-hesitant attitudes and to act upon them. Results show that the share of parents who report “deliberate” reasons against vaccination has decreased across birth cohorts; at the same time, the children of these parents have become less likely to be vaccinated. This suggests that vaccination-hesitant parents became more willing to act upon their beliefs towards the turn of the millennium. Regarding efforts to convince parents and the public about the benefits of vaccination, the number of parents who think that vaccinations have serious side effects, or that it is better for a child to live through a disease, may have become smaller—but these parents are more determined to follow their convictions. Interestingly, the trend we describe started before the Internet became a widespread source of health-related information."
https://openalex.org/W4212929421,"Leishmania (L) parasite, the causative agent of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL), effectively stimulates the mammalian cells to mount strong humoral responses by enhancing T-helper-2 (Th2)-associated cytokines for its survival. The best strategy to decrease the intensity of infection in the host is induction of cellular immunity.We evaluated the effects of the empty bacterial pcDNA3 plasmid on mice infected with L. major and quantified the immune mediators including IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IgG2a, IgG1, arginase activity and nitric oxide (NO) in the mice. Moreover, the footpad lesion size and parasite load were assessed.We observed that pcDNA3 could modulate the immune responses in favor of host cells and decrease the disease severity. Th2- associated mediators, including arginase, IL-4, and IL-10 are downregulated, while cellular responses are upregulated in line with an increase in the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and interfero-gamma (IFN-γ). Interestingly, pcDNA3 induced specific Th1-associated antibodies, IgG2a isotype; however, it suppressed the production of humoral IgG1. The stimulation of the immune response by the empty pcDNA3 is able to shift the immune function to predominant cellular responses caused by Th1, and it had a positive effect on the treatment of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL).Altogether, we introduced the pcDNA3 as a potential interfering factor in the modulation of the immune system against ZCL. Since this vector has been widely used as a control group in different studies, we suggest that the potential function of the empty vector should be deeply assessed, as it exerts anti-parasitic effects on mice infected with L. major."

Examination of illicit drug use networks has potential to assess the risk of TB exposure and disease progression. Research also is needed to assess mechanisms for accelerated TB transmission in this population. This study aims to 1) assess the rate of TB exposure, risk of disease progression, and disease burden among PWUD; 2) estimate the proportion of active TB cases resulting from recent transmission within this network; and 3) evaluate whether PWUD with TB disease have physiologic characteristics associated with more efficient TB transmission. Our cross-sectional, observational study aims to assess TB transmission through illicit drug use networks, focusing on methamphetamine and Mandrax (methaqualone) use, in a high TB burden setting and identify mechanisms underlying accelerated transmission. We will recruit and enroll 750 PWUD (living with and without HIV) through respondent driven sampling in Worcester, South Africa. Drug use will be measured through self-report and biological measures, with sputum specimens collected to identify TB disease by Xpert Ultra (Cepheid) and mycobacterial culture. We will co-enroll those with microbiologic evidence of TB disease in Aim 2 for molecular and social network study. Whole genome sequencing of Mycobacteria tuberculosis ( Mtb ) specimens and social contact surveys will be done for those diagnosed with TB. For Aim 3, aerosolized Mtb will be compared in individuals with newly diagnosed TB who do and do not smoke illicit drug. Knowledge from this study will provide the basis for a strategy to interrupt TB transmission in PWUD and provide insight into how this fuels overall community transmission.

Standardized CS approaches may be especially useful for developing communication interventions to encourage families to consider cancer genetic services. We engaged survivors of ovarian cancer and their close relatives as CS collaborators to collect and help interpret data to inform content for a website, printed invitation materials, and short-message reminders. We applied an implementation quality framework, and posed four research questions regarding the feasibility of CS: recruitment, data collection, data quality and evaluation of the experience. CS members were recruited through three networks: clinical sites, local and national cancer support organizations, and online ovarian cancer patient support groups. The professional research team operationalized theory-aligned CS tasks, five data collection options, question banks/scripts for creating surveys, structured interviews, online training and ongoing support from research coaches. 14 CS members agreed to the 12-week and 20-hour commitment for an honorarium. CS members opted to do both qualitative and quantitative assessments. CS members collected 261 surveys and 39 structured interviews. The largest number of surveys were collected for Task 1 (n = 102) to assess survivors’ reactions to different possible options for motivating survivors to visit a study website; 77% of this data were complete (i.e., no missing values). Data collected for tasks 2, 3, 4, and 5 (e.g., assessment of survivors’ and relatives’ respective communication preferences) ranged from 10 to 58 surveys (80% to 84% completeness). All data were collected within the specified time frame. CSs reported 17 hours of work on average and regarded the experience positively. Our experience suggests that CS engagement is feasible, can yield comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data, and is achievable in a relatively a short timeline."
https://openalex.org/W4213049735,"Precise regulation of chromosome separation through spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during oocyte meiosis is critical for mammalian reproduction. The kinetochore plays an important role in the regulation of SAC through sensing microtubule tension imbalance or missing microtubule connections. Here, we report that kinetochore scaffold 1 (KNL1, also known as CASC5), an outer kinetochore protein, plays a critical role in the SAC function of mouse oocytes. KNL1 localized at kinetochores from GVBD to the MII stage, and microinjection of KNL1-siRNA caused accelerated metaphase-anaphase transition and premature first meiosis completion, producing aneuploid eggs. The SAC was prematurely silenced in the presence of unstable kinetochore-microtubule attachments and misaligned chromosomes in KNL1-depleted oocytes. Additionally, KNL1 and MPS1 had a synergistic effect on the activation and maintenance of SAC. Taken together, our results suggest that KNL1, as a kinetochore platform protein, stabilizes SAC to ensure timely anaphase entry and accurate chromosome segregation during oocyte meiotic maturation."

Maximum occlusal force is an important indicator of masticatory function that is affected by age and sex. This preliminary study focused on the maximum occlusal force of young women and their eating habits, excluding food and nutritional factors, and investigated whether individual eating habits and eating habit patterns predict maximum occlusal force. We measured the maximum occlusal force for the whole dentition of 53 healthy young women before they ate lunch. The participants also completed a 12-item questionnaire about their eating habits. Scores were determined from the relationship between each item and increased maximum occlusal force. We found a significant but weak relationship between maximum occlusal force and some questions. The total questionnaire scores for the participants' eating habits showed an almost normal distribution (mean ± standard deviation: 22.7 ± 2.6, median: 23.0, mode: 23.0, range of total scores: 17-28). The accuracy of the linear regression between the total scores for eating habits and maximum occlusal force was high but not perfect (β: standardized regression coefficient = 0.527, P < 0.001). Although further research is needed, our findings confirm that eating habit patterns are significantly associated with maximum occlusal force and may help predict occlusal force. Our results provide important information about eating patterns in humans."

This study examined the care needs in daily tasks and associated factors in Ghana, following the World Health Organisation International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework.A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a sample of 400 older people from Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Southern Ghana. Care need was assessed by one question; ""Do you regularly need help with daily tasks because of long-term illness, disability, or frailty?"" Multivariate logistic regression was used to test the association between care need and independent variables based on the WHO-ICF conceptual framework.Majority of the sample (81%), particularly women (54%) reported needing care in daily tasks. Per the WHO-ICF conceptual framework, functional disability-activity variable, (OR = 1.07 95%CI: 1.05-1.09, p<0.001), and absence of government support-an environmental factor, (OR = 3.96 95%CI: 1.90-8.25, p<0.001) were associated with care need.The high prevalence of care needs among older people may offer an indication that majority of older people in Ghana could benefit from long-term care services. Functional disability and the absence of government support are the major issues that need to be prioritised in addressing the increased demand for care related to performing daily tasks among older people in Ghana."

In the field, a diversity of avalanche flow regimes has been reported including fast, sheared flows and slow plugs. While the significant role of cohesion and friction has been recognized, it is unclear how these mechanical properties affect avalanche flow regimes. Here, we model granular avalanches on a periodic inclined plane, using the distinct element method to better understand and quantify how inter-particle cohesion and ground friction influences avalanche velocity profiles. The cohesion between particles is modeled through bonds that can subsequently break and form, thus representing fragmentation and aggregation potentials, respectively. The implemented model shows a good ability to reproduce the various flow regimes and transitions as observed in nature: for low cohesion, highly sheared and fast flows are obtained while slow plugs form above a critical cohesion value and for lower ground frictions. Simulated velocity profiles are successfully compared to experimental measurements from the real-scale test site of Vallée de la Sionne in Switzerland. Even though the model represents a strong simplification of the reality, it offers a solid basis for further investigation of relevant processes happening in snow avalanches, such as segregation, erosion and entrainment, with strong impacts on avalanche dynamics research, especially in a climate change context."

One of the psychostimulants widely consumed in Ethiopia and East African countries is Catha edulis Forsk (khat). However, no studies have been conducted on the cognitive effects of khat and its correlation with serum electrolytes. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of khat on spatial learning and memory and their correlation with serum electrolytes.Diethyl ether and chloroform (3:1v/v ratio) were solvents used to obtain the crude khat extract in this study. T80W was used to prepare the khat juice, fresh khat leave extract. The rats were received crude khat extract subchronically (KESC) (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg b.w), khat juice (KHJ 2.5 mL/kg), 2% tween 80 in distilled water (T80W- v/v, vehicle) and khat extract subacutely (KESA) (300 mg/kg). For subchronic treatment, each rat was administered for twelve weeks before Morris water maze experiment has been started, while it was administered for a week for acute treatment. Spatial learning and memory were measured using the Morris water maze model and serum sodium, calcium, potassium, and chloride were evaluated using Cobas 6000.Spatial learning was improved with trials across the groups, while average escape latency (s) of rats received KESC 200 mg/kg (p<0.001), KESC 300 mg/kg (p<0.01) and KHJ 2.5 mL/kg (p<0.05) was significantly greater than rats that received vehicle. There was no significant difference in the latency between rats that received KESA 300mg/kg and vehicle (p>0.05). Thigmotaxis was significantly higher in rats that received all doses of khat extract (p<0.001). The time spent in the target quadrant in rats that received KESC 300 mg/kg was significantly reduced (p<0.05). Serum calcium level was inversely correlated with the escape latency (R = -0.417, p<0.05) in rats that received khat.Khat extract and juice administered subchronically, but not subacutely, impaired learning and memory and was associated with serum calcium reduction. The neuronal basis for such alteration should be investigated."

Methods A short online survey of experts and lay people measuring when participants believe important vaccine milestones would occur and how likely potential setbacks were. Samples of US and Canadian lay people recruited through Qualtrics. The expert sample was created through a contact network in vaccine development and supplemented with corresponding authors of recent scholarly review articles on vaccine development. Results In aggregate, lay people gave responses that were within 3 months of experts, tending to be later than experts for early milestones and earlier for later milestones. Median lay best estimates for when a vaccine would be available to the public were 08/2021 and 09/2021 for the US and Canadian samples, compared with 09-10/2021 for the experts. However, many individual lay responses showed more substantial disagreement with expert opinions, with 54% of lay best estimates of when a vaccine would be available to the public being before the median expert soonest estimate or after the median expert latest estimate. Lay people were much more pessimistic about vaccine development encountering setbacks than experts (median probability 59% of boxed warning compared with only 30% for experts). Misalignment between layperson and expert expectations was not explained by any demographic variables collected in our survey. Conclusion Median lay expectations were generally similar to experts. At the individual level, however, lay people showed substantial variation with many believing milestones would occur much sooner than experts. Lay people were in general much more pessimistic about the prospect of setbacks than were experts."

https://openalex.org/W4213324469,"Human groups show a variety of leadership dynamics ranging from egalitarian groups with no leader, to groups with changing leaders, to absolutist groups with a single long-term leader. Here, we model transitions between these different phases of leadership dynamics, investigating the role of inequalities in relationships between individuals. Our results demonstrate a novel riches-to-rags class of leadership dynamics where a leader can be replaced by a new individual. We note that the transition between the three different phases of leadership dynamics resembles transitions in leadership dynamics during the Neolithic period of human history. We argue how technological developments, such as food storage and/or weapons which allow one individual to control large quantities of resources, would mean that relationships became more unequal. In general terms, we provide a model of how individual relationships can affect leadership dynamics and structures."
