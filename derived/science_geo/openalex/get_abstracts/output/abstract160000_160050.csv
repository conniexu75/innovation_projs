https://openalex.org/W2091166549,"Because semiconductor nanowires can transport electrons and holes, they could function as building blocks for nanoscale electronics assembled without the need for complex and costly fabrication facilities. Boron- and phosphorous-doped silicon nanowires were used as building blocks to assemble three types of semiconductor nanodevices. Passive diode structures consisting of crossed p - and n -type nanowires exhibit rectifying transport similar to planar p - n junctions. Active bipolar transistors, consisting of heavily and lightly n -doped nanowires crossing a common p -type wire base, exhibit common base and emitter current gains as large as 0.94 and 16, respectively. In addition, p - and n -type nanowires have been used to assemble complementary inverter-like structures. The facile assembly of key electronic device elements from well-defined nanoscale building blocks may represent a step toward a “bottom-up” paradigm for electronics manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W2030496130,"One-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanowires and nanotubes, represent the smallest dimension for efficient transport of electrons and excitons and thus are ideal building blocks for hierarchical assembly of functional nanoscale electronic and photonic structures. We report an approach for the hierarchical assembly of one-dimensional nanostructures into well-defined functional networks. We show that nanowires can be assembled into parallel arrays with control of the average separation and, by combining fluidic alignment with surface-patterning techniques, that it is also possible to control periodicity. In addition, complex crossed nanowire arrays can be prepared with layer-by-layer assembly with different flow directions for sequential steps. Transport studies show that the crossed nanowire arrays form electrically conducting networks, with individually addressable device function at each cross point."

We colonized germ-free mice with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron , a prominent component of the normal mouse and human intestinal microflora. Global intestinal transcriptional responses to colonization were observed with DNA microarrays, and the cellular origins of selected responses were established by laser-capture microdissection. The results reveal that this commensal bacterium modulates expression of genes involved in several important intestinal functions, including nutrient absorption, mucosal barrier fortification, xenobiotic metabolism, angiogenesis, and postnatal intestinal maturation. These findings provide perspectives about the essential nature of the interactions between resident microorganisms and their hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2031611126,"Although astrocytes constitute nearly half of the cells in our brain, their function is a long-standing neurobiological mystery. Here we show by quantal analyses, FM1-43 imaging, immunostaining, and electron microscopy that few synapses form in the absence of glial cells and that the few synapses that do form are functionally immature. Astrocytes increase the number of mature, functional synapses on central nervous system (CNS) neurons by sevenfold and are required for synaptic maintenance in vitro. We also show that most synapses are generated concurrently with the development of glia in vivo. These data demonstrate a previously unknown function for glia in inducing and stabilizing CNS synapses, show that CNS synapse number can be profoundly regulated by nonneuronal signals, and raise the possibility that glia may actively participate in synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2051204826,"The movement of liquid drops on a surface with a radial surface tension gradient is described here. When saturated steam passes over a colder hydrophobic substrate, numerous water droplets nucleate and grow by coalescence with the surrounding drops. The merging droplets exhibit two-dimensional random motion somewhat like the Brownian movements of colloidal particles. When a surface tension gradient is designed into the substrate surface, the random movements of droplets are biased toward the more wettable side of the surface. Powered by the energies of coalescence and collimated by the forces of the chemical gradient, small drops (0.1 to 0.3 millimeter) display speeds that are hundreds to thousands of times faster than those of typical Marangoni flows. This effect has implications for passively enhancing heat transfer in heat exchangers and heat pipes."
https://openalex.org/W2146234408,"Our understanding of the pathobiology of severe pulmonary hypertension, usually a fatal disease, has been hampered by the lack of information of its natural history. We have demonstrated that, in human severe pulmonary hypertension, the precapillary pulmonary arteries show occlusion by proliferated endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) are involved in proper maintenance, differentiation, and function of endothelial cells. We demonstrate here that VEGFR-2 blockade with SU5416 in combination with chronic hypobaric hypoxia causes severe pulmonary hypertension associated with precapillary arterial occlusion by proliferating endothelial cells. Prior to and concomitant with the development of severe pulmonary hypertension, lungs of chronically hypoxic SU5416-treated rats show significant pulmonary endothelial cell death, as demonstrated by activated caspase 3 immunostaining and TUNEL. The broad caspase inhibitor Z-Asp-CH2-DCB prevents the development of intravascular pulmonary endothelial cell growth and severe pulmonary hypertension caused by the combination of SU5416 and chronic hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2154284281,"Long sediment cores recovered from the deep portions of Lake Titicaca are used to reconstruct the precipitation history of tropical South America for the past 25,000 years. Lake Titicaca was a deep, fresh, and continuously overflowing lake during the last glacial stage, from before 25,000 to 15,000 calibrated years before the present (cal yr B.P.), signifying that during the last glacial maximum (LGM), the Altiplano of Bolivia and Peru and much of the Amazon basin were wetter than today. The LGM in this part of the Andes is dated at 21,000 cal yr B.P., approximately coincident with the global LGM. Maximum aridity and lowest lake level occurred in the early and middle Holocene (8000 to 5500 cal yr B.P.) during a time of low summer insolation. Today, rising levels of Lake Titicaca and wet conditions in Amazonia are correlated with anomalously cold sea-surface temperatures in the northern equatorial Atlantic. Likewise, during the deglacial and Holocene periods, there were several millennial-scale wet phases on the Altiplano and in Amazonia that coincided with anomalously cold periods in the equatorial and high-latitude North Atlantic, such as the Younger Dryas."
https://openalex.org/W2080613763,"Aromaticity is a concept invented to account for the unusual stability of an important class of organic molecules: the aromatic compounds. Here we report experimental and theoretical evidence of aromaticity in all-metal systems. A series of bimetallic clusters with chemical composition MAl 4 – (M = Li, Na, or Cu), was created and studied with photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. All the MAl 4 – species possess a pyramidal structure containing an M + cation interacting with a square Al 4 2– unit. Ab initio studies indicate that Al 4 2– exhibits characteristics of aromaticity with two delocalized π electrons (thus following the 4 n + 2 electron counting rule) and a square planar structure and maintains its structural and electronic features in all the MAl 4 – complexes. These findings expand the aromaticity concept into the arena of all-metal species."

It strongly affects agricultural yields, water management, fish inventories, and terrestrial ecology. In their Perspective,
 Hurrell, Kushnir, and Visbeck
 report recent research into the NAO discussed at an American Geophysical Union Chapman Conference at the end of 2000. Much remains to be learned about the NAO, but it seems increasingly less likely that natural variability is the cause for the recent upward NAO trend."

https://openalex.org/W2032674459,"Biofilms are formed by the aggregation of microorganisms into multicellular structures that adhere to surfaces. Here we show that bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can initiate biofilm formation. When grown in low-glucose medium, the yeast cells adhered avidly to a number of plastic surfaces. On semi-solid (0.3% agar) medium they formed ""mats"": complex multicellular structures composed of yeast-form cells. Both attachment to plastic and mat formation require Flo11p, a member of a large family of fungal cell surface glycoproteins involved in adherence. The ability to study biofilm formation in a tractable genetic system may facilitate the identification of new targets for antifungal therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1993682681,"The relationship between the number of species and the area sampled is one of the oldest and best-documented patterns in community ecology. Several theoretical models and field data from a wide range of plant and animal taxa suggest that the slope, z , of a graph of the logarithm of species richness against the logarithm of area is roughly constant, with z ≈ 0.25. We collected replicated and randomized plant data at 11 spatial scales from 0.01 to 10 8 square meters in Great Britain which show that the slope of the log-log plot is not constant, but varies systematically with spatial scale, and from habitat to habitat at the same spatial scale. Values of z were low (0.1 to 0.2) at small scales (&lt;100 square meters), high (0.4 to 0.5) at intermediate scales (1 hectare to 10 square kilometers), and low again (0.1 to 0.2) for the largest scale transitions (e.g., East Berks to all of Berkshire). Instead of one process determining changes in species richness across a wide range of scales, different processes might determine plant biodiversity at different spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W2007322879,"Mitral cells (MCs) in the olfactory bulb (OB) respond to odors with slow temporal firing patterns. The representation of each odor by activity patterns across the MC population thus changes continuously throughout a stimulus, in an odor-specific manner. In the zebrafish OB, we found that this distributed temporal patterning progressively reduced the similarity between ensemble representations of related odors, thereby making each odor's representation more specific over time. The tuning of individual MCs was not sharpened during this process. Hence, the individual responses of MCs did not become more specific, but the odor-coding MC assemblies changed such that their overlap decreased. This optimization of ensemble representations did not occur among olfactory afferents but resulted from OB circuit dynamics. Time can therefore gradually optimize stimulus representations in a sensory network."
https://openalex.org/W2023561026,"Skeletal muscle protein and function decline with advancing age but the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that the catabolic cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) contributes to this process, we studied the effects of aging and resistance exercise on TNF-alpha expression in human muscle. Using in situ hybridization, TNF-alpha message was localized to myocytes in sections of skeletal muscle from elderly humans. Both TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels were elevated in skeletal muscle from frail elderly (81+/-1 year) as compared to healthy young (23+/-1 year) men and women. To determine whether resistance exercise affects TNF-alpha expression, frail elderly men and women were randomly assigned to a training group or to a nonexercising control group. Muscle biopsies were performed before and after 3 months. Muscle TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels decreased in the exercise group but did not change in the control group. Muscle protein synthesis rate in the exercise group was inversely related to levels of TNF-alpha protein. These data suggest that TNF-alpha contributes to age-associated muscle wasting and that resistance exercise may attenuate this process by suppressing skeletal muscle TNF-alpha expression."
https://openalex.org/W2001878168,"Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy systems use coils, either singly or as arrays, to intercept radio-frequency (RF) magnetic flux from regions of interest, often deep within the body. Here, we show that a new magnetic material offers novel possibilities for guiding RF flux to the receiver coil, permitting a clear image to be obtained where none might otherwise be detectable. The new material contains microstructure designed according to concepts taken from the field of photonic band gap materials. In the RF range, it has a magnetic permeability that can be produced to specification while exhibiting negligible direct-current magnetism. The latter property is vital to avoid perturbing the static and audio-frequency magnetic fields needed to obtain image and spectral data. The concept offers a new paradigm for the manipulation of RF flux in all nuclear magnetic resonance systems."
https://openalex.org/W2063301281,"The in vivo cellular impact of age-associated mitochondrial DNA mutations is unknown. We hypothesized that mitochondrial DNA deletion mutations contribute to the fiber atrophy and loss that cause sarcopenia, the age-related decline of muscle mass and function. We examined 82,713 rectus femoris muscle fibers from Fischer 344 x Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats of ages 5, 18, and 38 months through 1000 microns by serial cryosectioning and histochemical staining for cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase. Between 5 and 38 months of age, the rectus femoris muscle in the hybrid rat demonstrated a 33% decrease in mass concomitant with a 30% decrease in total fibers at the muscle mid-belly. We observed significant increases in the number of mitochondrial abnormalities with age from 289 +/- 8 ETS abnormal fibers in the entire 5-month-old rectus femoris to 1094 +/- 126 in the 38-month-old as calculated from the volume density of these abnormalities. Segmental mitochondrial abnormalities contained mitochondrial DNA deletion mutations as revealed by laser capture microdissection and whole mitochondrial genome amplification. Muscle fibers harboring mitochondrial deletions often displayed atrophy, splitting and increased steady-state levels of oxidative nucleic damage. These data suggest a causal role for age-associated mitochondrial DNA deletion mutations in sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2024206386,"We determined the structure of the hydrated Cu(II) complex by both neutron diffraction and first-principles molecular dynamics. In contrast with the generally accepted picture, which assumes an octahedrally solvated Cu(II) ion, our experimental and theoretical results favor fivefold coordination. The simulation reveals that the solvated complex undergoes frequent transformations between square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal configurations. We argue that this picture is also consistent with experimental data obtained previously by visible near-infrared absorption, x-ray absorption near-edge structure, and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The preference of the Cu(II) ion for fivefold instead of sixfold coordination, which occurs for other cations of comparable charge and size, results from a Jahn-Teller destabilization of the octahedral complex."
https://openalex.org/W1975349241,"Paracrine interactions between endothelial cells (EC) and mural cells act as critical regulators of vessel wall assembly, vessel maturation and define a plasticity window for vascular remodeling. The present study was aimed at studying blood vessel maturation processes in a novel 3-dimensional spheroidal coculture system of EC and smooth muscle cells (SMC). Coculture spheroids differentiate spontaneously in a calcium-dependent manner to organize into a core of SMC and a surface layer of EC, thus mimicking the physiological assembly of blood vessels with surface lining EC and underlying mural cells. Coculture of EC with SMC induces a mature, quiescent EC phenotype as evidenced by 1) a significant increase in the number of junctional complexes of the EC surface layer, 2) a down-regulation of PDGF-B expression by cocultured EC, and 3) an increased resistance of EC to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, EC cocultured with SMC become refractory to stimulation with VEGF (lack of CD34 expression on VEGF stimulation; inability to form capillary-like sprouts in a VEGF-dependent manner in a 3-dimensional in gel angiogenesis assay). In contrast, costimulation with VEGF and Ang-2 induced sprouting angiogenesis originating from coculture spheroids consistent with a model of Ang-2-mediated vessel destabilization resulting in VEGF responsiveness. Ang-2 on its own was able to stimulate endothelial cells in the absence of Ang-1 producing SMC, inducing lateral sheet migration as well as in gel sprouting angiogenesis. Taken together, the data establish the spheroidal EC/SMC system as a powerful cell culture model to study paracrine interactions in the vessel wall and provide functional evidence for smooth muscle cell-mediated quiescence effects on endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2100914972,"The vitamin E analog alpha-tocopheryl succinate (alpha-TOS) can induce apoptosis. We show that the proapoptotic activity of alpha-TOS in hematopoietic and cancer cell lines involves inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC), since phorbol myristyl acetate prevented alpha-TOS-triggered apoptosis. More selective effectors indicated that alpha-TOS reduced PKCalpha isotype activity by increasing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. The role of PKCalpha inhibition in alpha-TOS-induced apoptosis was confirmed using antisense oligonucleotides or PKCalpha overexpression. Gain- or loss-of-function bcl-2 mutants implied modulation of bcl-2 activity by PKC/PP2A as a mitochondrial target of alpha-TOS-induced proapoptotic signals. Structural analogs revealed that alpha-tocopheryl and succinyl moieties are both required for maximizing these effects. In mice with colon cancer xenografts, alpha-TOS suppressed tumor growth by 80%. This epitomizes cancer cell killing by a pharmacologically relevant compound without known side effects."
https://openalex.org/W1963550744,"Most mammalian somatic cells are thought to have a limited proliferative capacity because they permanently stop dividing after a finite number of divisions in culture, a state termed replicative cell senescence. Here we show that most oligodendrocyte precursor cells purified from postnatal rat optic nerve can proliferate indefinitely in serum-free culture if prevented from differentiating; various cell cycle-inhibitory proteins increase, but the cells do not stop dividing. The cells maintain high telomerase activity and p53- and Rb-dependent cell cycle checkpoint responses, and serum or genotoxic drugs induce them to acquire a senescence-like phenotype. Our findings suggest that some normal rodent precursor cells have an unlimited proliferative capacity if cultured in conditions that avoid both differentiation and the activation of checkpoint responses that arrest the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2109846452,"We investigated whether enhanced expression of alphaB crystallin, a stress-inducible molecular chaperone of the small heat shock family, can protect myocardial contractile apparatus against ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. Transgenic mice overexpressing alphaB crystallin were generated using the 0.76 kb rat alphaB crystallin cDNA cloned into a pCAGGS plasmid driven by a human cytomegalovirus expression system. Southern analysis confirmed transgene integration and Northern and Western blotting characterized expression (3.1-fold and 6.9-fold elevations in myocardial mRNA and protein levels, respectively). Extent of functional recovery over a 3 h reperfusion period following a 20 min ischemic period in transgenic and wild-type mouse hearts was assessed using an ex vivo work-performing heart preparation. The transgenic group displayed significantly higher values of DP at R45 min (29.14+/-1.9 mm Hg vs. 17.6+/-0.7 mm Hg), R60 min (31.56+/-1.7 mm Hg vs. 17.8+/-0.8 mm Hg), and R75 min (32.5+/-2.2 mm Hg vs. 16.9+/-0.9 mm Hg), and of dLVP/dt at R45 min (1740.2+/-111.5 mm Hg.s-1 vs. 548.7+/-82.2 mm Hg.s-1) and R60 min (1199.8+/-104.6 mm Hg.s-1 vs. 466.9+/-61.1 mm Hg.s-1). The transgenic group also displayed development of less oxidative stress, decreased extent of infarction, and attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptotic cell death. Transgene overexpression of alphaB crystallin was therefore successful in diminishing the independent contributory effects of both necrosis and apoptosis on I/R-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1989335335,"VPF/VEGF acts selectively on the vascular endothelium to enhance permeability, induce cell migration and division, and delay replicative senescence. To understand the changes in gene expression during endothelial senescence, we investigated genes that were differentially expressed in early vs. late passage (senescent) human dermal endothelial cells (HDMEC) using cDNA array hybridization. Early passage HDMEC cultured with or without VPF/VEGF overexpressed 9 and underexpressed 6 genes in comparison with their senescent counterparts. Thymosin beta-10 expression was modulated by VPF/VEGF and was strikingly down-regulated in senescent EC. The beta-thymosins are actin G-sequestering peptides that regulate actin dynamics and are overexpressed in neoplastic transformation. We have also identified senescent EC in the human aorta at sites overlying atherosclerotic plaques. These EC expressed senescence-associated neutral beta-galactosidase and, in contrast to adventitial microvessel endothelium, exhibited weak staining for thymosin beta-10. ISH performed on human malignant tumors revealed strong thymosin beta-10 expression in tumor blood vessels. This is the first report that Tbeta-10 expression is significantly reduced in senescent EC, that VPF/VEGF modulates thymosin beta-10 expression, and that EC can become senescent in vivo. The reduced expression of thymosin beta-10 may contribute to the senescent phenotype by reducing EC plasticity and thus impairing their response to migratory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2011814301,"Intracellular membrane fusion is mediated by the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins. All vesicle transport steps also have an essential requirement for a member of the Sec1 protein family, including the neuronal Munc18-1 (also known as nSec1) in regulated exocytosis. Here, in adrenal chromaffin cells, we expressed a Munc18 mutant with reduced affinity for syntaxin, which specifically modified the kinetics of single-granule exocytotic release events, consistent with an acceleration of fusion pore expansion. Thus, Munc18 functions in a late stage in the fusion process, where its dissociation from syntaxin determines the kinetics of postfusion events."
https://openalex.org/W1996667340,"The Pine Island Glacier (PIG) transports 69 cubic kilometers of ice each year from ∼10% of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). It is possible that a retreat of the PIG may accelerate ice discharge from the WAIS interior. Satellite altimetry and interferometry show that the grounded PIG thinned by up to 1.6 meters per year between 1992 and 1999, affecting 150 kilometers of the inland glacier. The thinning cannot be explained by short-term variability in accumulation and must result from glacier dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2081304354,Replicative senescence is thought to be an intrinsic mechanism for limiting the proliferative life-span of normal somatic cells. We show here that rat Schwann cells can be expanded indefinitely in culture while maintaining checkpoints normally lost during the immortalization process. These findings demonstrate that senescence is not an inevitable consequence of extended proliferation in culture.
https://openalex.org/W1749029280,"ABSTRACT Endogenous peroxides and related reactive oxygen species may influence various steps in the contractile process. Single mouse skeletal muscle fibers were used to study the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and t ‐butyl hydroperoxide (f‐BOOH) on force and myoplasmic Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ). Both peroxides (10 −1 to 10 −5 M) decreased tetanic [Ca 2+ ] i and increased force during submaximal tetani. Catalase (1 kU/ml) blocked the effect of H 2 O 2 , but not of t ‐BOOH. The decrease in tetanic [Ca 2+ ] i was constant, while the effect on force was biphasic: A transitory increase was followed by a steady decline to the initial level. Myofibrillar Ca 2+ sensitivity remained increased during incubation with either peroxide. Only the highest peroxide concentration (10 μM) increased resting [Ca 2+ ] i and slowed the return of [Ca 2+ ] i to its resting level after a contraction, evidence of impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ re‐uptake. The peroxides increased maximal force production and the rate of force redevelopment, and decreased maximum shortening velocity. N‐ethylmaleimide (25 μM, thiol‐alkylating agent) prevented the response to 1 μM H 2 O 2 . These results show that myofibrillar Ca 2+ sensitivity and cross‐bridge kinetics are influenced by H2O2 and t ‐BOOH concentrations that approach those found physiologically, and these findings indicate a role for endogenous oxidants in the regulation of skeletal muscle function."
https://openalex.org/W2098251659,"Our method for producing tissue-engineered blood vessels based exclusively on the use of human cells, i.e., without artificial scaffolding, has previously been described (1). In this report, a tissue-engineered vascular media (TEVM) was specifically produced for pharmacological studies from cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The VSMC displayed a differentiated phenotype as demonstrated by the re-expression of VSMC-specific markers and actual tissue contraction in response to physiological stimuli. Because of their physiological shape and mechanical strength, rings of human TEVM could be mounted on force transducers in organ baths to perform standard pharmacological experiments. Concentration-response curves to vasoconstrictor agonists (histamine, bradykinin, ATP, and UTP) were established, with or without selective antagonists, allowing pharmacological characterization of receptors (H1, B2, and P2Y1, and pyrimidinoceptors). Sustained agonist-induced contractions were associated with transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, suggesting sensitization of the contractile machinery to Ca2+. ATP caused both Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ release from a ryanodine- and caffeine-sensitive store. Increased cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP levels caused relaxation. This human TEVM displays many of functional characters of the normal vessel from which the cells were originally isolated, including contractile/relaxation responses, cyclic nucleotide sensitivity, and Ca2+ handling mechanisms comparable to those of the normal vessel from which the cells were originally isolated. These results demonstrate the potential of this human model as a versatile new tool for pharmacological research."
https://openalex.org/W2113199467,The IMAGE spacecraft uses photon and neutral atom imaging and radio sounding techniques to provide global images of Earth's inner magnetosphere and upper atmosphere. Auroral imaging at ultraviolet wavelengths shows that the proton aurora is displaced equatorward with respect to the electron aurora and that discrete auroral forms at higher latitudes are caused almost completely by electrons. Energetic neutral atom imaging of ions injected into the inner magnetosphere during magnetospheric disturbances shows a strong energy-dependent drift that leads to the formation of the ring current by ions in the several tens of kiloelectron volts energy range. Ultraviolet imaging of the plasmasphere has revealed two unexpected features—a premidnight trough region and a dayside shoulder region—and has confirmed the 30-year-old theory of the formation of a plasma tail extending from the duskside plasmasphere toward the magnetopause.
https://openalex.org/W2132717546,"Shedding of cell surface molecules, including growth factor receptors, provides a mechanism by which cells regulate signal transduction events. Here we show that platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 is shed from the endothelial cell surface during apoptosis and accumulates in the culture medium as a approximately 100 kDa soluble protein. The cleavage mediating the shedding is matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dependent, as GM6001, a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, inhibits PECAM-1 accumulation in the culture medium in a dose-responsive manner. In addition to the 100 kDa soluble fragment, PECAM-1 cleavage generates the formation of a truncated (Tr.) approximately 28 kDa molecule, composed of the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic PECAM-1 domains. Transfections of the full-length (Fl) and the Tr. PECAM-1 gene constructs into endothelial and nonendothelial cells were performed. We found 1) significantly more gamma-catenin and SHP-2 bound to the truncated than to the full-length PECAM-1; 2) stable expression of the truncated PECAM-1 in SW480 colon carcinoma cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation, whereas expression of comparable levels of the full-length PECAM-1 had no effect; 3) the decrease observed in cell proliferation is due, in part, to an increase in programmed cell death (apoptosis) and correlated with continuous caspase 8 cleavage and p38/JNK phosphorylation. These results support the intimate involvement of PECAM-1 in signal transduction cascades and also suggest that caspase substrates (e.g., PECAM-1) may possess distinct and unique functions on cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1982069916,"We describe a heptameric protein pore that has been engineered to accommodate two different cyclodextrin adapters simultaneously within the lumen of a transmembrane beta barrel. The volume between the adapters is a cavity of approximately 4400 cubic angstroms. Analysis of single-channel recordings reveals that individual charged organic molecules can be pulled into the cavity by an electrical potential. Once trapped, an organic molecule shuttles back and forth between the adapters for hundreds of milliseconds. Such self-assembling nanostructures are of interest for the fabrication of multianalyte sensors and could provide a means to control chemical reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2056631693,"Transcriptional repression of the silent mating-type loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a cell cycle-dependent establishment step that is commonly assumed to involve DNA replication. Using site-specific recombination, we created a nonreplicating DNA ring in vivo to test directly the role of replication in establishment of silencing. Sir1 was tethered to the ring following excision from the chromosome to activate a dormant silencer. We show here that silencing can be established in DNA that does not replicate. The silenced ring adopted structural features characteristic of bona fide silent chromatin, including an altered level of DNA supercoiling and reduced histone acetylation. In addition, the process required silencing factors Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 and progression between early S and M phases of the cell cycle. The results indicate that passage of a replication fork is not the cell-cycle event required for establishment of silencing in yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2083366213,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the silent mating loci are repressed by their assembly into heterochromatin. The formation of this heterochromatin requires a cell cycle event that occurs between early S phase and G(2)/M phase, which has been widely assumed to be DNA replication. To determine whether DNA replication through a silent mating-type locus, HMRa, is required for silencing to be established, we monitored heterochromatin formation at HMRa on a chromosome and on a nonreplicating extrachromosomal cassette as cells passed through S phase. Cells that passed through S phase established silencing at both the chromosomal HMRa locus and the extrachromosomal HMRa locus with equal efficiency. Thus, in contrast to the prevailing view, the establishment of silencing occurred in the absence of passage of the DNA replication fork through or near the HMR locus, but retained a cell cycle dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2024584640,"Trefoil factors (TFFs) are protease-resistant peptides that promote epithelial cell migration and mucosal restitution during inflammatory conditions and wound healing in the gastrointestinal tract. To date, the molecular mechanism of TFFs action and their possible role in tumor progression are unclear. In the present study, we observed that premalignant human colonic PC/AA/C1 and canine kidney MDCK epithelial cells are not competent to invade collagen gels in response to exogenously added TFFs (pS2, spasmolytic polypeptide, and intestinal trefoil factor). In contrast, activated src and RhoA exert permissive induction of invasion by the TFFs that produce similar parallel dose-response curves in src-transformed MDCKts.src and PCmsrc cells (EC50=20-40 nM). Cell scattering is also induced by TFFs in MDCKts.src cells. Stable expression of the pS2 cDNA promotes constitutive invasiveness in MDCKts.src-pS2 cells and human colonic HCT8/S11-pS2 cells established from a sporadic tumor. Furthermore, we found that TFF-mediated cellular invasion is dependent of several signaling pathways implicated in cell transformation and survival, including phosphoinositide PI3'-kinase, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and the rapamycin target TOR. Constitutive and intense expression of pS2 was revealed by Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry in human colorectal tumors and their adjacent control mucosa during the neoplastic progression, from the adenoma to the liver metastases. Our studies indicated that TFFs can be involved in cell scattering and tumor invasion via autocrine loops and may serve as potential targets in the control of colon cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2086933999,"The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the signaling pathway used by leptin to stimulate lipolysis. The lipolytic rate of white adipocytes from sex- and age-matched lean (+/+) and fa/fa rats was determined in the absence or presence of leptin together with a number of agents acting at different levels of the signaling cascade. Leptin did not modify FSK-, dbcAMP-, and IBMX-stimulated lipolysis. Lipolysis can also be maximally stimulated by lowering media adenosine levels with adenosine deaminase (ADA), i.e., in the ligand-free state. Although ADA produced near maximal lipolysis in adipocytes of lean animals, only half of the maximal lipolytic rate (50.9+/-3.2%) was achieved in fat cells from fa/fa rats (P=0.0034). In adipocytes from lean animals preincubated with ADA, leptin caused a concentration-related stimulation of lipolysis (P=0.0001). However, leptin had no effect on the lipolytic activity of adipocytes in the ligand-free state from fa/fa rats. The adenosine A1 receptor agonist CPA effectively inhibited basal lipolysis in both lean and obese adipocytes (P=0.0001 and P=0.0090, respectively). Leptin had no effect on the lipolytic rate of adipocytes isolated from fa/fa rats and preincubated with CPA. When adipocytes were incubated with the A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX, a significant increase in glycerol release was observed in fa/fa fat cells (P=0.009), whereas cells isolated from lean rats showed no differences to ADA-stimulated lipolysis. After pretreatment with PTX, which inactivates receptor-mediated Gi function, adipocytes of obese rats became as responsive to the stimulatory actions of ISO as cells from lean rats (P=0.0090 vs. ISO in fa/fa rats; P=0.2416 vs. lean rats, respectively). PTX treatment of lean cells, however, did not alter their response to this lipolytic agent. It can be concluded that the lipolytic effect of leptin is located at the adenylate cyclase/Gi proteins level and that leptin-induced lipolysis opposes the tonic inhibition of endogenous adenosine in white adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2046728528,"We have previously identified two closely related nuclear binding proteins that specifically interact with two unique functional AT-rich sequences of the 5' regulatory region of the human insulin receptor gene. Expression of these nuclear binding proteins increases during myocyte and adipocyte differentiation, and in other tissues appears to correlate with insulin receptor content. We have hypothesized, therefore, that insulin receptor expression in the insulin target tissues is regulated at least in part by these nuclear proteins. Here we show data on purification and biochemical characterization of these DNA binding proteins. Using a conventional chromatographic purification procedure combined with electrophoresis mobility shift assay and immunoblot analyses, a unique approximately 15 kDa protein, either identical to or highly related to the architectural transcription factor HMGI(Y), has now been identified, suggesting an essential role for HMGI(Y) in regulating insulin receptor gene transcription. Direct evidence of HMGI(Y) insulin receptor promoter interactions is provided by functional analysis with the CAT reporter gene and by hormone binding studies in cells expressing HMGI(Y) antisense RNA. In these experiments, antisense HMGI(Y) specifically inhibits insulin receptor promoter function and insulin receptor protein expression, indicating that HMGI(Y) is required for proper transcription of insulin receptor gene. Moreover, our data consistently support the hypothesis that a putative defect in this nuclear binding protein may cause insulin receptor dysfunction with subsequent impairment of insulin signaling and action."
https://openalex.org/W2020178134,"Granulocyte extravasation from the blood into tissues is a prerequisite for a proper inflammatory response. It is regulated by a multistep adhesion cascade consisting of successive contacts between leukocyte surface receptors and their endothelial ligands on vessels. Vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1) is an endothelial surface glycoprotein with two functions. It is an enzyme (monoamine oxidase) and an adhesion molecule for lymphocytes. Its function in binding of granulocytes or in leukocyte trafficking into sites of inflammation in vivo has remained unknown. Here we show that treatment of rabbits with anti-VAP-1 monoclonal antibodies abrogates approximately 70% of granulocyte extravasation into a site of an experimental inflammation. Using intravital microscopy, VAP-1 blockade is shown to increase the velocity of the rolling granulocytes and the frequency of their jerky skippings during the rolling. In addition, the number of firmly bound leukocytes decreased by 44% when VAP-1 was rendered nonfunctional. Our results suggest that VAP-1 functions as a molecular brake early in the adhesion cascade and consequently decreases the firm adherence; it may also directly influence the transmigration step. These data elucidate a new interplayer in the granulocyte extravasation process and provide a novel physiological function for a member of the monoamine oxidase family."

https://openalex.org/W2084900761,"We previously reported that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is the predominant NOS in the intestine. Inducible NOS (iNOS), an enzyme involved in the inflammatory response, is regulated by cytokines via the transcriptional factor NF-kappaB. We examined a new mechanism of intestinal iNOS regulation with respect to the role of nNOS and its effect on NF-kappaB. Young Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 4 days with 1) saline, 2) 7-nitroindazole (7-NI, specific nNOS inhibitor), 3) 7-NI + pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, NF-kappaB inhibitor), or 4) PDTC. Intestinal iNOS mRNA, NF-kappaB activity, and the tissue content of the regulatory IkappaBalpha were examined. We found that 7-NI-treated animals had higher intestinal NF-kappaB (p50-p65) activity, lower IkappaBalpha content, and increased intestinal iNOS mRNA, iNOS protein, and iNOS activity compared with controls. All of these changes were abolished when PDTC was given together with 7-NI. PDTC alone had no effect. 7-NI induces a delayed increase in intestinal myeloperoxidase activity (after elevation in NF-kappaB and iNOS), which could be abrogated by PDTC. We conclude that in normal rat small intestine, nNOS suppresses the gene expression of iNOS through NF-kappaB down-regulation and that nNOS suppression leads to IkappaBalpha degradation, NF-kappaB activation, and iNOS expression."
https://openalex.org/W2113402130,"Desensitization of macrophages is important during the development of sepsis. It was our intention to identify mechanisms that promote macrophage deactivation upon contact with endotoxin (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in vitro. Macrophage activation was achieved with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), and the oxidative burst (i.e., oxygen radical formation) was followed by oxidation of the redox-sensitive dyes hydroethidine and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Prestimulation of macrophages for 15 h with a combination of LPS/IFN-gamma attenuated oxygen radical formation in response to TPA. Taking the anti-inflammatory properties of the peroxisome proliferator-activating receptorgamma (PPARgamma) into consideration, we established activation of PPARgamma in response to LPS/IFN-gamma by an electrophoretic mobility shift, supershift, and a reporter gene assay. The reporter contains a triple PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) in front of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter driving the luciferase gene. We demonstrated that PPRE decoy oligonucleotides, supplied in front of LPS/IFN-gamma, allowed a full oxidative burst to recover upon TPA addition. Furthermore, we suppressed the oxidative burst by using the PPARgamma agonists 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2, BRL 49653, or ciglitazone. No effect was observed with WY 14643, a PPARalpha agonist. We conclude that activation of PPARs, most likely PPARgamma, promotes macrophage desensitization, thus attenuating the oxidative burst. This process appears important during development of sepsis."

Calculations reveal that a given angle of the radiation conical wavefront is associated with two velocities, one above and one below a certain speed threshold. Emission at subluminal but not superluminal speeds is predicted and verified experimentally for relativistic dipoles generated with an optical method based on subpicosecond pulses moving in a nonlinear medium. The dipolar Cherenkov field, in the range of infrared-active phonons, is identical to that of phonon polaritons produced by impulsive laser excitation."
https://openalex.org/W2102650486,"An apoptotic cellular defense mechanism is triggered in response to viral dsRNA generated during the course of infection by many DNA and RNA viruses. We demonstrate that apoptosis induced by dsRNA or a paramyxovirus is independent of the action of interferon as it can proceed in a variety of cell lines and primary cells deficient in an interferon response. Initiation of apoptosis appears to be triggered by activation of a cellular transcription factor, the dsRNA-activated factor (DRAF1). DRAF1 is composed of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and the transcriptional coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) or p300. We find that activation of IRF-3 in the absence of viral infection stimulates apoptosis. In addition, a negative interfering mutant blocks both target gene induction and apoptosis, demonstrating a requirement for gene expression by IRF-3/DRAF1 to promote apoptosis. IRF-3/DRAF1 target gene expression is also induced in response to a distinct apoptotic stimulus, the DNA damaging agent etoposide. The activity of the p53 tumor suppressor does not appear to be required for IRF-3/DRAF1-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2019784233,"Integrin-associated protein (CD47/IAP) is a pentaspan molecule that regulates integrin functions. We prepared a CD47-deficient Jurkat T cell line to assess its role in the arrest of T cells on inflammatory endothelium. Under flow conditions, constitutive arrest of CD47-deficient cells is strongly decreased as compared to the original cell line, whereas reexpression of CD47 reestablishes their ability to stop. Moreover, cells transfected with a chimera made with the extracellular portion of CD47 and the transmembrane domain of CD7 or several truncated forms of CD47 show that the first transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic loop are sufficient for this process. CD47 effect is indirect and depends mainly on the alpha4beta1/VCAM-1 pathway, as shown by blocking antibodies. We detected on endothelium the two CD47 counter receptors known to date: thrombospondin and SIRP1alpha. Blocking experiments show that both are involved. Overall, CD47 participates in the constitutive arrest of T lymphocytes on inflamed vascular endothelium by up-regulating alpha 4beta1 integrins."
https://openalex.org/W2075902865,"Vascular immunotargeting, the administration of drugs conjugated with antibodies to endothelial surface antigens, has the potential for drug delivery to the endothelium. Our previous cell culture studies showed that biotinylated antibodies to PECAM-1 (a highly expressed endothelial surface antigen) coupled with streptavidin (SA, a cross-linking protein that facilitates anti-PECAM internalization and targeting) may provide a carrier for the intracellular delivery of therapeutic enzymes. This paper describes the PECAM-directed vascular immunotargeting of a reporter enzyme (beta-galactosidase, beta-Gal) in intact animals. Intravenous injection of [125I]SA-beta-Gal conjugated with either anti-PECAM or IgG led to a high 125I uptake in liver and spleen, yet beta-Gal activity in these organs rapidly declined to the background levels, suggesting rapid degradation of the conjugates. In contrast, anti-PECAM/[125I]SA-beta-Gal, but not IgG/[125I]SA-beta-Gal, accumulated in the lungs (36.0+/-1.3 vs. 3.9+/-0.6% injected dose/g) and induced a marked elevation of beta-Gal activity in the lung tissue persisting for up to 8 h after injection (10-fold elevation 4 h postinjection). Using histochemical detection, the beta-Gal activity in the lungs was detected in the endothelial cells of capillaries and large vessels. The anti-PECAM carrier also provided 125I uptake and beta-Gal activity in the renal glomeruli. Predominant intracellular localization of anti-PECAM/SA-beta-Gal was documented in the PECAM-expressing cells in culture by confocal microscopy and in the pulmonary endothelium by electron microscopy. Therefore, vascular immunotargeting is a feasible strategy for cell-selective, intracellular delivery of an active foreign enzyme to endothelial cells in vivo, and thus may be potentially useful for the treatment of acute pulmonary or vascular diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2015051992,"We report that prosaposin treatment induced extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and sphingosine kinase activity, increased DNA synthesis, and prevented cell apoptosis. Prosaposin treatment induced pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) to enter the S phase of the cell cycle; this effect was inhibited by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, indicating that prosaposin-induced ERK phosphorylation is required for stimulation of DNA synthesis. The prosaposin effect was also inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating that the prosaposin receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor. Prosaposin rescued PC12 cells from apoptosis induced by staurosporine or ceramide. Sphingosine kinase activity was increased by prosaposin treatment. We propose that this effect is a mechanism underlying the proliferative and anti-apoptotic functions of prosaposin. Prosaposin appears to be a key regulatory factor in the ceramide-S-1-P rheostat, which regulates cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2052613680,"The addition of low concentrations (0.1-1 nM) of extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein to PC12 neuronal cells stimulated a rapid (peak at 5 min) elevation of the cAMP intracellular levels, which in turn induced the phosphorylation of CREB transcription factor (peak at 15 min) on serine-133 (Ser-133). On the contrary, at later time points (60-120 min) Tat induced a significant decline of intracellular cAMP with respect to the basal levels observed in control cells treated with bovine serum albumin. In blocking experiments performed with pharmacological inhibitors, Tat decreased the intracellular levels of cAMP and CREB Ser-133 phosphorylation through a signal transduction pathway involving the sequential activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT, and cyclic nucleoside phosphodiesterases. Moreover, in transient transfection experiments, Tat inhibited transcription of CREB promoter in a manner strictly dependent on the presence of the cAMP-responsive elements (CRE) in the CREB promoter. Consistently, the expression of endogenous CREB protein was significantly reduced in PC12 cells by prolonged (24-48 h) treatment with Tat. This decline in the expression of CREB, which plays an essential role in the survival and function of neuronal cells, anticipated a progressive increase of apoptosis in Tat-treated cells. Although obtained in a neuronal cell line, our findings might help to explain some aspects of the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2080476890,"Comparative anatomists since the time of Richard Owen (1) have observed that birds and crocodilians have a four-chambered heart and have speculated that such a heart was present in extinct archosaurs as well. Until recently, no direct evidence of the cardiovascular system had been reported in any archosaur fossil. Fisher et al. (2), however, using computerized tomography (CT) scanning, reported the discovery of a four-chambered heart with a single systemic aorta within the chest region of a dinosaur fossil dating from the Cretaceous. Even more surprising, the specimen reportedly was collected from channel sandstones of the Hell Creek Formation, a fluvial setting that rarely preserves soft tissues. Examination by one of us (Rowe) of the specimen in the North Carolina State Museum of Natural Science and examination of the CT imagery (3), however, lead us to conclude that the object is not a fossilized heart but an ironstone concretion. Such concretions are commonly found in Upper Cretaceous fluvial sediments of the North American western interior, often in association with dinosaur bones."
https://openalex.org/W2098896832,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 is expressed by astrocytes in diverse inflammatory states and is a key regulator of monocyte recruitment to the central nervous system (CNS). In the current study, we addressed mechanisms by which transcription of the human MCP-1 gene (hMCP-1) was terminated, after induction by interferon (IFN)-gamma. Our results demonstrated that IFN-gamma-induced transcription of hMCP-1 was followed by a refractory state, during which hMCP-1 was resistant to restimulation by either IFN-gamma or heterologous activators such as TNF-alpha. This refractory state affected the hMCP-1 gene selectively, as other IFN-gamma-inducible genes remained responsive to restimulation. The IFN-gamma-induced hMCP-1 refractory state was governed at the transcriptional level and was sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors, suggesting a requirement for newly expressed components. A minimal 213 base pair hMCP-1 regulatory element directed both IFN-gamma-mediated transcription and the subsequent refractory state. We previously demonstrated that IFN-gamma treatment resulted in coordinate protein occupancy in vivo of two hMCP-1 promoter elements, a gamma-activated site (GAS) and a GC-rich element. During the refractory state, IFN-gamma treatment failed to induce protection of either the hMCP-1 GAS element or the GC box. These results furnish insight into the expression of hMCP-1 during CNS inflammation and provide the first delineation of an IFN-gamma-induced transcriptional refractory state."
https://openalex.org/W2033238639,"Mouse astrocytes deficient in the mitochondrial form of superoxide dismutase do not grow in culture under 20% atmospheric O2 levels. By flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and enzymatic analysis we have shown that the oxygen block of cell division is due to a decrease in the number of cells entering the S phase of the cell cycle and is concomitant with higher DNA oxidation and impairment of mitochondrial functions. Seeding the cells under 5% O2 until the cultures become confluent can circumvent this problem. An initial hypoxic environment increases the resistance of manganese superoxide dismutase-deficient astrocytes to superoxide radicals artificially produced by paraquat treatment, preserves respiratory activity, and allows normoxic division during a subsequent passage. DNA oxidation is then not higher than in wild-type control cells. However, the adaptation of the cells is not due to compensation by other enzymes of the antioxidant defense system and is specific to cells totally lacking manganese superoxide dismutase. Alteration of the phenotype by prior hypoxia exposure in the SOD2-deficient mutant provide a unique model to study adaptative mechanisms of cellular resistance to oxygen toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2088093789,"One of the mysteries of nebulae in the vicinity of bright stars is the appearance of bright emission spectral lines of ions, which imply fairly high excitation temperatures. We suggest that an ion formation mechanism, based on resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization (RETPI) by intense H Lyman alpha radiation (wavelength of 1215 angstroms) trapped inside optically thick nebulae, can produce these spectral lines. The rate of such an ionization process is high enough for rarefied gaseous media where the recombination rate of the ions formed can be 10(-6) to 10(-8) per second for an electron density of 10(3) to 10(5) per cubic centimeter in the nebula. Under such conditions, the photo-ions formed may subsequently undergo further RETPI, catalyzed by intense He i and He ii radiation, which also gets enhanced in optically thick nebulae that contain enough helium."
