https://openalex.org/W2049104280,"Three cosmic x-ray sources have been observed from a water-launched rocket carrying two x-ray detectors to an altitude of 200 kilometers. The x-ray spectra, measured in the photon energy range between 1 and 40 kiloelectron volts, are all different. The sources in order of hardness of spectra are Cyg XR-1, Tau XR-1, and Sco XR-1. The intensity of Sco XR-1 decreased at low photon energies. The differences in spectra might be interpreted as evidence of different source mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2080054500,"The sex attractant produced in extremely small amount by the virgin female pink bollworm moth has been isolated in pure form and identified as 10-propyl-trans- 5, 9-tridecadienyl acetate. Successful synthesis of this molecule confirms the structure and makes possible its practical use to help control this destructive pest of cotton. The attractant, for which the common name ""propylure"" is suggested, may be the first naturally occurring compound with propyl branching to be reported."
https://openalex.org/W2091535140,"Six out of eight minor chemical elements, determined by spectroscopic and neutron-activation techniques, were found to be critical in computing a probability that a given copper artifact was derived from one of three types of copper ore: native metal, oxidized ore, reduced ore. Two elements, gold and tin, were apparently alloyed deliberately in many artifacts from both the Old World and the New World."

https://openalex.org/W2024488319,"Scavenger probe sampling for determining the concentration of certain gaseous free radicals and atoms has been used to study flames and electric discharges. Combining microprobe sampling and chemical scavenging with mass spectral analysis, this technique offers high spatial resolution, absolute concentration determination, and high temperature applicability. The reactions of hydrogen atoms with chlorinated hydrocarbons and oxygen atoms with nitrogen dioxide were used for scavenging. The results were reproducible and proportional to concentration. In an electric discharge oxygen atom concentrations agreed with gas phase titration determinations. The gas phase titration measures atom flux rather than concentration, and differences as high as 20 percent were observed. A method for deriving concentration from flux measurements is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2051646016,"Trophozoites of Hexamita salmonis, asserted pathogen of juvenile salmonid fishes, were isolated from two species of Pacific salmon hosts and cultured repeatedly in an organic medium saturated with nitrogen. Primary isolates and serial subcultures usually exhibited five- to tenfold population increases per passage."

https://openalex.org/W2062263335,"Analysis of a series of pollen samples and artifact materials, taken from the same excavation units in prehistoric sites in the Middle Pecos River, valley of central eastern New Mexico, shows meaningful correlations between some major pollen groups and categories of artifacts. The correlations suggest the use of relative quantities of artifact materials to correct the distortion, resulting from cultural activity, in pollen sanmples from archeological sites."
