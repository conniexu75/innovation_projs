This reaction occurs aerobically and anaerobi- cally, and without detectable acetoacetate formation. The effects of substrate and liver extract concentration on the rate of hydrolysis have been studied. Formation of pyruvic acid from 2,4-diketovaleric acid has also been demonstrated in liver slices. A series of eleven other 2,4-diketo acids is hydrolyzed in a similar manner to yield pyruvic acid. The hydroly- sis of 2,4-diketoundecylic acid resulted in the appearance of equimolar amounts of pyruvic and octanoic acids. Of the diketo acids studied, 2,4- diketohexanoic and 2,4-diketocapric acids are hydrolyzed most rapidly. The pH optima for hydrolysis of the normal aliphatic 2,4-diketo acids are in the range 7.2 to 7.9 for the 5-, 6-, and 7-carbon acids, and 8.0 to 8.9 for the acids containing between 8 and 11 carbon atoms. The term “acylpyruvase” is proposed for the enzyme or enzymes which catalyze 2,4-diketo acid hydrolysis. Acylpyruvase activity is present in the liver and kidney of the rat, rabbit, cat, and mouse. All other tissues studied, including primary rat hepatoma, possess little enzymatic activity. A partially purified enzyme preparation has been obtained from rat liver. Methods of preparation of the disodium salts of 2,4-diketo acids are given. The ultraviolet absorption spectra for the ethyl esters of aliphatic and aromatic 2,4-diketo acids and the relationship between enolization and ultraviolet absorption are described. A spectrophotometric method for the determination of acylpyruvase activity is presented. Implications of these findings in terms of intermediary metabolism are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1992190215,"As yet, the absorption of the star-producing radiation has only been measured in air. Nevertheless, the variation of the intensity of single tracks recorded in photographic plates under various lead absorbers has been measured at high altitude and at sea-level1,2. The decrease of single tracks with a given lead absorber is found to be much less than the decrease of stars in an equal weight of the atmosphere. Perkins2 has shown that the number of single tracks is proportional to the number of stars, and therefore it appears established that the range of the star-producing component of cosmic radiation expressed in gm./cm.2 is larger by a factor of approximately 3 in lead than it is in air."

The demonstration of astaxanthin in locust, they say, particularly interesting because, apart from its detection in the retina and eye colourings of birds, this is the first time it has been reported in land animals."

It is frequently possible to observe very fine fibrils and particles with a clarity hitherto only obtained by dark-ground illumination. Thus, I have observed living Leptospira, said to be only 0·15 µ in Width, as well as very small granules inside bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W71924837,"IN a recent communication1, Wyngaarden, Woods and Seevers have shown that ‘Myanesin' administered intravenously to dogs appears in the urine mainly in combination with glycuronic acid, while a small amount is excreted without change. We have found that after intravenous administration to humans or rabbits, a portion is oxidized and excreted as α-hydroxy-β-(2-methylphenoxy)propionic acid. The acid may be isolated by acidifying the urine to pH 3, extracting with ether continuously for 24–48 hours, transferring from the ether extract into sodium bicarbonate solution and recovering from the aqueous solution by acidifying and extracting with ether. The ether-soluble product is crystallized first from carbon tetrachloride, then from water and finally from chloroform. The pure acid melts at 146–147° (corr.) (found: C, 61·2 ; H, 6·1 ; C10H12O4 requires C, 61·2 ; H, 6·1 per cent). The acid is not optically active. It is identical with the acid obtained by condensing o-cresol with β-chlorolactic acid (found : C, 61·1; H, 6.1 per cent)."

Dubois has always been very guarded in his comments on the prehistoric teeth ; but the fossil have received much attention because they were ascribed to Pithecanthropus erectus. The results of a recent study made by me on this material* are summarized here."
https://openalex.org/W2045618865,"WE have observed certain definite changes in the testes of some inbred hamsters. These changes are characterized by a striking testicular hypoplasia, mostly bilateral. Such testes, represented sometimes by structures which are almost invisible to the naked eye, appeared very pale, with an apparent lack of normal vascularization. Their individual weight was only 2–306 mgm., as compared with a testicular weight of 0·900–1·400 gm. in the normal hamster. However, we have observed fertile animals the individual testes of which weighed only 0·580 gm. The hamsters with bilateral hypoplasia were, without exception, sterile. On the other hand, the animals with unilateral hypoplasia proved to be fertile. No relationship was found between the hypoplasia and the growth-rate or mature weight of the animals. Although we have also observed hypoplasia of the ovaries and sterility in some females, our data in this respect are inconclusive."
https://openalex.org/W1973851134,"IN the course of experiments on the bactericidal action of X-rays on the R and S phases of Escherichia coli, it was found that the survival-rate in three stocks (76, 111, Ida), irradiated twenty-four hours after seeding, was different1; one of them (stock Ida) was more resistant to the radiation as compared with the other two stocks. No significant differences were found between S and R phases of the same strains. According to the hit-theory of biological effects of radiation the survival-rate is a measure of the target volume, which has been assumed to represent the bacterial ‘nucleus'2,3. If in the case of bacteria the so-called nucleoplasmic ratio of plants and animals holds true, and if, on the other side, the target volume obtained from X-ray experiments really represents the size of the bacterial ‘nucleus', one would expect the size of the bacterial cells to be correlated to the target volumes. A biometric analysis of twenty-four hours old bacteria, carried on the projected images of photomicrographs of bacteria stained with Henrici‘s Congo Red method4, has shown that E. coli with a larger target volume are larger than the ones with smaller target volume. The variability curves obtained for the three stocks were almost normal, and the differences found between their means were statistically significant. It is suggested that such correlation might indicate the presence of polyploidy among different stocks of the same bacterial species, as it has previously been found in other organisms. A detailed description of such experiments will be published elsewhere."

https://openalex.org/W2004970946,"WHEN 5 ml. of a very dilute (c. 0.05 per cent) solution of tryptophan in 60–80 per cent acetic acid is treated with a drop of 1 per cent aqueous potassium iodate, and warmed to boiling, a violet-pink colour develops, and an intense greenish-orange fluorescence. On dilution with two volumes of water, the pigment gradually separates, and can be extracted with isobutyl alcohol or with chloroform, in Which solvent it shows a strong absorption band at λ565–555 mμ, and a weak band.at λ520–515 mμ. Pigment formation requires a large excess of acetic acid, otherwise the mixture turns brown, and an iodo-tryptophan is precipitated, from which the pigment cannot be generated. The pigment is stable in acid solution, and both tint and fluorescence survive exposure to air and light for months."

https://openalex.org/W1974485949,"DURING dissections of an immature male specimen of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forskål), a yellowish larva of Nemestrinidæ was found feeding on the testes and the surrounding adipose tissue. It was 1 cm. long. Its posterior end was surrounded by a chitinous cup leading to a slender respiratory tube c. 2 cm. long, which Was constricted transversally along its whole length (these constrictions disappear when pressed during the preparation). The respiratory tube went longitudinally along the midgut and then was bent at right-angles towards the spiracle of the first abdominal segment. The tube was more or less uniform in width, becoming dilated at the cup surrounding the posterior spiracle of the larva. The end of the tube entered the meeting place of the tracheæ, which was considerably expanded. The chitin of this end was blackish-brown, due to pathological changes."

These unexpected observations were the reverse of those obtained by other investigators testing the same samples by different methods2. Furthermore, when residual films of the insecticides in a light, refined paraffin spray oil were prepared and tested in this laboratory, samples (II) and (III) were at least as toxic as (I)."
https://openalex.org/W1980825897,"ACCORDING to the definition of Barclay et al.1, the ‘renal threshold' can be expressed as a rate of tubular reabsorption per 100 c.c. glomerular filtrate. Thus where T is ‘threshold', Rx is the amount of the ‘threshold substance' reabsorbed by the tubules (mgm./min.), and C is clearance of inulin, or mannitol. The same conception of the ‘threshold' is also used by Harrison et al.2."

https://openalex.org/W4245125108,"AFTER a tour lasting six and a half months, during which the Atomic Energy Exhibition, organised by the Atomic Scientists' Association, visited twenty-five of the main centres in England, Scotland and Wales, the exhibition came to a close on May 28. Efforts to secure an extension in Great Britain failed ; but the exhibition will continue its existence abroad. The Council of the Atomic Scientists' Association, as well as the Ministry of Supply and other owners of equipment, have agreed to lend the exhibits to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and the Lebanese Government for incorporation in an exhibition at the Unesco Conference in Beirut in October. Later it will probably tour several countries in the Middle East and, possibly, various European countries. Although the administration of the tour is left to Unesco, the Atomic Scientists' Association will be closely connected with it, and the atomic energy part of the exhibition will be known as that of the British Atomic Scientists' Association."

https://openalex.org/W4237009886,"THE Philosophical Magazine was first published in 1798, and the board of directors and the editorial board have every reason to be proud of the journal‘s record during its long life of a hundred and fifty years. The title-page to the first volume indicates a breadth of interest “comprehending the various branches of science, the liberal and fine arts, agriculture, manufactures and commerce”. Succeeding volumes of the Magazine have achieved for it an international reputation as a scientific journal in the realm of physical and mathematical science. David Brewster, John Tyndall, William Thomson, Oliver Lodge, J. J. Thomson are names to be found in the list of editois who succeeded Alexander Tilloch and Richard Taylor, and it is not surprising that such men of science have been responsible for the publication of important papers by research workers in various fields, including those of relativity and atomic physics. The traditionally high standard of the Philosophical Magazine has been well maintained, and we wish the periodical every success on the journey towards the two hundredth anniversary of its foundation."

(now Sir John) Cockcroft was appointed director in January, 1946. In order to provide a nucleus of accommodation and a prepared site, the permanent R.A.F. aerodrome of Harwell was allocated to the Establishment and building work began there in April, 1946. Harwell was chosen because of its convenient geographical location, combining reasonable access to London with nearness to a large university (Oxford), which was considered to be important so that staff should have good opportunities for discussion with university colleagues."
