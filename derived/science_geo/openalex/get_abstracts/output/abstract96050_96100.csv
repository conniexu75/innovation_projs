https://openalex.org/W2031299737,"The site where peripherally administered cholecystokinin-8 elicits satiety was investigated by injecting rats with cholecystokinin-8 (1 to 8 micrograms per kilogram of body weight, intraperitoneally) after they had received bilateral lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus or after they had undergone bilateral abdominal vagotomy or selective vagotomies. Abdominal vagotomy or gastric vagotomy abolished or reduced the satiety effect of cholecystokinin, but lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus did not. These results demonstrate that peripherally administered cholecystokinin acts in the abdomen through gastric vagal fibers and not directly on the brain to produce satiety in the rat."

Refinement may be a multistage process akin to fractional distillation; the stack of cisternae comprising the cis Golgi may be the plates in this distillation tower. The trans Golgi, consisting of the last one or two cisternae, may be the receiver that collects from the cis Golgi only its most refined fraction for later distribution to specific locations throughout the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1963615151,"Data are presented on four indicators of genetic effects from studies of children born to survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The indicators are frequency of untoward pregnancy outcomes (stillbirth, major congenital defect, death during the first postnatal weak); occurrence of death in live-born children, through an average of life expectancy of 17 years; frequency of children with sex chromosome aneuploidy; and frequency of children with mutation resulting in an eletrophoretic variant. In no instance is there a statistically significant effect of parental exposure; but for all indicators the observed effect is in the direction suggested by the hypothesis that genetic damage resulted from the exposure. On the basis of assumptions concerning the contribution that spontaneous mutation in the preceding generation makes to the indicators in question, it is possible to estimate the genetic doubling dose for radiation for the first three indicators (the data base is still too small for the fourth). The average of these estimates is 156 rems. This is some four times higher than the results from experimental studies on the mouse with comparable radiation sources, which have been the principal guide to the presumed human sensitivities. The relevance of these data in setting permissible limits for human exposures is discussed briefly."
https://openalex.org/W4250992172,"Populations of microorganisms inhabiting a common environment complete for nutrients and other resources of the environment. In some cases, the populations even excrete into the environment chemicals that are toxic or inhibitory to their competitors. Competition between two populations tends to eliminate one of the populations from their common habitat, especially when competition is focused on a single resource and when the populations do not otherwise interact. However, a number of factors mitigate the severity of competition and thus competitors often coexist."
https://openalex.org/W2033812096,"Acetylcholine and bradykinin produced potent relaxation of isolated canine intrapulmonary arteries contracted by serotonin, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine-provided the endothelium was left intact. Selective mechanical destruction of the endothelium transformed the activity of these substances from vasodilatation to vasoconstriction. Acetylcholine-induced relaxations, in the presence of intact endothelium, could be selectively inhibited competitively by atropine, but could not be inhibited by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, adrenergic blocking drugs, or histaminergic antagonists. RElaxations produced by prostacyclin, prostaglandin E1, isoproterenol, papaverine, or histamine H2-receptor agonists were not modified, or attenuated, by selective destruction of pulmonary endothelial cells. These observations might provide insight into the etiology of the increased pulmonary resistance observed in pulmonary hypertension and shock lung."
https://openalex.org/W2034341342,"Intravitreal injection of a fluorescent dye, Procion yellow, results in the complete and systematic staining of a cone population in the monkey retina. These cones form an approximately regular array whose separation varies with retinal eccentricity. They are absent in the very center of the fovea, and their density peaks at 1 degree. The distribution of stained cones resembles that reported for blue-sensitive cones of other primates and, consistent with such an identification, they are found with less incidence in species having lower concentrations of blue cones."

One kind of fluorescent emission emanates from a photoproduct of the visual pigment, other kinds may be ascribed to photostable pigments. These phenomena provide not only a means of spectrally mapping the retina but also a new spectroscopic tool for analyzing the primary visual processes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1992463039,"Freshly isolated hepatocytes from phenobarbital-treated rats were incubated in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium with three differently acting liver cell toxins, namely carbon tetrachloride, bromobenzene, and ethylmethanesulfonate. In the absence of extracellular calcium these three compounds were far more toxic to the cells than in its presence. This result is inconsistent with the hypothesis that an influx of extracellular calcium is required as the final step in toxic liver cell injury."
https://openalex.org/W1995343720,"Pathogenic mycobacteria such as tubercle bacilli are usually killed when immunity is developed in an infected animal or man. It has long been thought that macrophages are responsible for this killing but all attempts to demonstrate this in vitro have been unsuccessful1–7, which has severely hampered our understanding of how immunity to tuberculosis is expressed. In particular, indirect evidence that hydrogen peroxide from macrophages might kill tubercle bacilli in vivo8–11 could not be properly tested. Recent studies have shown that macrophages can be activated by exposure to soluble products of immunologically stimulated T lymphocytes (lymphokines) so that they acquire a new or enhanced ability to kill infectious agents and tumour cells12–15. Hydrogen peroxide has been implicated as a key macrophage product needed for killing13–16. We report here that normal mouse peritoneal macrophages can be activated in vitro by lymphokines to kill Mycobacterium microti, the natural agent of tuberculosis in voles, and that added catalase protects the bacilli from killing."
https://openalex.org/W1999882436,"We have studied the transcription in vitro of the rabbit beta-globin gene in the HeLa cell system. Using cloned fragments of this gene, we obtained specific transcripts with 5' ends at the ""cap"" site. The analysis of the transcription of a large number of deletion mutants has shown that the cap site and the conserved CCAAT box at 75 nucleotides upstream from the cap site are not required for specific in vitro transcription. Sequences localized within the region from 34 to 20 nucleotides upstream from the 5' end of the cap site, however, are required for in vitro transcription. Since the conserved ""Goldberg-Hogness"" box is localized in this region, we conclude that this is the major requirement for specific transcription in vitro. Finally, in at least eight cases, deletions localized to the 3' side of the Goldberg-Hogness box shift the transcription-initiation site downstream to a position approximately 30 nucleotides from the Goldberg-Hogness box. This is consistent with the idea that RNA polymerase II is bound at the Goldberg-Hogness box and initiates transcription 30 nucleotides downstream from this site. There is apparently little sequence specificity in the selection of the site of initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1992933148,"Dynamic random-dot stereograms and correlograms were used to elicit visually evoked brain potentials from human infants, and these potentials were compared with potentials evoked by classical checkerboard pattern reversal. The results indicate that infants begin to produce stereoscopically evoked potentials at the age of 10 to 19 weeks, several weeks after showing classical checkerboard-evoked potentials, and suggest that the onset of cortical binocularity precedes stereopsis."

Seizure threshold temperatures, measured rectally and intracerebrally, increased between 2 and 10 days of age. Electrocortical paroxysmal discharges were confirmed in hyperthermic 6- and 10-day-old pups. The increasing resistance to hyperthermic seizures with maturation and the electroencephalographic changes induced by hyperthermia are similar to those in young children."

https://openalex.org/W1997861888,"Strabismics pointed to targets (without sight of the hand) before and again after surgery that altered the position of the deviating eye in its orbit. Patients having this surgery for the first time were able to use proprioceptively derived information about the surgically altered eye position. In contrast, patients who had similar operations, but on muscles that had been operated on one or more times in the past, were apparently deprived of this information. The important afference may be supplied by the tendon organs."

https://openalex.org/W1577549297,"Abstract 4-Coumarate:CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.12) from cell suspension cultures of parsley (Petroselinum hortense) was extensively purified. The enzyme behaved as a monomer with a molecular weight of approximately 60,000. A rabbit antiserum to the purified enzyme was obtained and used to determine the rates of 4-coumarate:CoA ligase synthesis under various conditions of induction, such as short term or continuous irradiation and treatment of the cells with an elicitor preparation from a fungal pathogen. In all cases, the time course of changes in the rate of synthesis, measured both in vivo and in vitro, was very similar for 4-coumarate:CoA ligase and a closely related enzyme, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.5). The results suggest that the mRNA activities encoding the two enzymes are regulated in a coordinated manner."
https://openalex.org/W2054401586,"The concentrations of the major norepinephrine metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol (MOPEG), in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid of alcoholic patients were markedly elevated during intoxication and successively declined during 1 and 3 weeks of abstinence. During intoxication the MOPEG concentration in cerebrospinal fluid showed a statistically significant correlation with the blood alcohol concentration. In healthy volunteers who received 80 grams of ethanol, the MOPEG concentration in cerebrospinal fluid increased significantly. Healthy subjects sampled during intoxication had significantly higher concentrations of MOPEG in the cerebrospinal fluid than did subjects sampled after the end of intoxication. The results indicate that alcohol administration markedly stimulates norepinephrine metabolism in the central nervous system in human subjects possibly by increasing unit impulse activity of central noradrenergic neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2084325301,"These studies use microinjection to determine whether the selective degradation of cytosolic proteins involves selective transfer of proteins to lysosomes or selective proteolysis within the cytosol. 14C-Sucrose-labeled bovine serum albumin (14C-sucBSA) was conjugated to polylysine, and monolayers of L929 cells were exposed to the conjugate. The 14C-sucrose-labeled peptides that arose upon degradation of the added 14C-sucBSA polylysine accumulated exclusively within lysosomes. In contrast, when 14C-sucBSA or 14C-sucrose-labeled pyruvate kinase (14C-sucPK) was microinjected into L929 cells, over half the 14C-sucrose-labeled peptides derived from the injected proteins were present in the postlysosomal supernatant. Control experiments demonstrated that the microinjection procedure did not cause 14C-sucrose peptides to leak from lysosomes. Therefore, the presence in the cytosol of substantial amounts of the degradation products from injected 14C-sucBSA and 14C-sucPK confirms the existence of a major proteolytic system(s) within or readily accessible to the cytosol of animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2055370711,The weight of interscapular brown fat in the rat and its rate of respiration increased in response to a single meal.

https://openalex.org/W1596090014,"The existence in HeLa cell extracts of two separate RNA (nucleoside-2')-methyltransferases involved in the modification of mRNA was established using assays that specifically measure the conversion of cap O [m7G(5')pppNpN-] to cap I [m7G(5')pppNmpN-] and cap I to cap II [m7G(5')pppNmpNm-]. Cap II methyltransferase activity was found almost exclusively in cytoplasmic fractions while cap I methyltransferase activity was also found in the nucleus, its apparent biological site of action. The two enzymes were purified by DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatography and their optimal reaction conditions were determined. The substrate specificity of cap I methyltransferase was examined with particular regard to information that would help elucidate the natural order of capping and methylation was drawn from data presented here. Both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides in the N position of M7G(5')pppN- were methylated by purified cap I methyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W2040945088,"Mice were injected daily, for up to 10 weeks, with purified monoclonal immunoglobulin G from patients with myelomatous polyneuropathy or benign gammopathy. The animals developed a demyelinating polyneuropathy with slowed nerve conduction velocities. The putative antinerve factor may be an antibody since injection of Fab fragments from the monoclonal immunoglobulin G produced a similar demyelination. This provides evidence of a circulating factor in the serum of myeloma patients with polyneuropathy that reproduces typical features of the human disease on passive transfer. This disorder is thus distinguished from other neuropathies that occur as remote effects of malignant disease but have no identified pathogenic factors associated with them."
https://openalex.org/W2027487402,"The normal succession of sleep and waking states through a night is disturbed in infants at risk for the sudden infant death syndrome. Compared with normal infants, siblings of the sudden infant death syndrome victims have longer intervals between active sleep epochs at particular times during the night in the newborn period and a decreased tendency to enter short waking periods at 2 and 3 months of age. The latter finding is interpreted as an increased tendency to remain asleep, or a relative failure to arouse from sleep in infants at risk."

https://openalex.org/W1895082447,"Fatty acid methyl esters are the major radioactive lipid products obtained after incubation of rat lung membranes with [methyl-3H or 14C]S-adenosylmethionine. Evidence which suggests an enzymatic transmethylation includes: time and protein dependence, lack of reaction at 0 degrees C or with heat-denatured membranes, an apparent affinity for S-adenosylmethionine of about 1 microM, inhibition by S-adenosylhomocysteine, and lack of inhibition by 0.1% methanol. Activity was highest in microsomes but present in other membranous fractions. Endogenous activity was highest in membranes from parotid, lung, and pancreas. Products were analyzed by organic solvent extraction, thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography. Identification of methylpalmitate, methylstearate, methyloleate, and methyllinoleate was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Presence of the radioactive methyl group was demonstrated by the variation of isotopic ratios with specific activity. Addition of oleate to incubation mixture increased the rate of product formation and preincubation experiments suggested the absence of long lived intermediates. The data suggest an enzymatic transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to free fatty acids."

The parasite clearly altered mouse performance on tests of exploration, activity, learning, and motor coordination; behavioral effects in mice receiving lead alone were less general. Consequence of Toxocara administration appeared attenuated in animals receiving both agents. Parasite larvae were found in the central nervous system in all infected mice."

https://openalex.org/W2043744785,"Abstract We investigated the nature of the defect in the temperature-sensitive mutant of Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MuSV), termed ts 110. This mutant has a temperature-sensitive defect in a function required for maintenance of the transformed state. A nonproducer cell clone, 6m2, infected with ts110 expresses P85 and P58 at 33°C, the transformed temperature, but only P58 is detected at the restrictive temperature of 39°C. Shift-up (33°C → 39°C) and in vitro experiments have established that P85 is not thermolabile for immunoprecipitation. Previous temperature-shift experiments (39°C → 33°C) have shown that P85 synthesis resumes after a 2–3 hr lag period. Temperature shifts (39°C → 33°C) performed in the presence of actinomycin D prevented the synthesis of P85, whereas P58 synthesis did not decline for 5 hr, suggesting that P58 and P85 are translated from different mRNAs. The shift-up experiments also indicated that, once made, the RNA coding for P85 can function at the restrictive temperature for several hours. MuSV- ts 110-infected cells superinfected with Mo-MuLV produced a ts110 MuSV-MuLV mixture. Sucrose gradient analysis of virus subunit RNAs revealed a ∼28S and a ∼35S peak. Electrophoresis of the ∼28S poly(A)-containing RNA from ts110 virus in methyl mercuric hydroxide gels resolved two RNAs with estimated sizes of 1.9 × 10 6 and 1.6 × 10 6 daltons, both smaller than the wild type MuSV-349 genomic RNA (2.2 × 10 6 daltons). RNA in the ∼28S size class from virus preparations harvested at 33°C was found to translate from P85 and P58, whereas, the ∼35S RNA yielded helper virus Pr63 gag . In contrast, virus harvested at 39°C was deficient in P85 coding RNA only. Peptide mapping experiments indicate that P85 contains P23 sequences, a candidate Moloney mouse sarcoma virus src gene product. Taken together, these results suggest that two virus-specific RNAs are present in ts 110-infected 6m2 cells and rescued ts 110 pseudotype virions at 33°C, one coding for P85, whose expression can be interfered with by shifting the culture to 39°C; the other coding for P58, whose expression is unaffected by temperature shifts. P85 is a candidate gag-src fusion protein, while P58 contains gag sequences only."

In the three medically important schistosome species, glycogen content was greater in unpaired males than in copulating males, suggesting that the female depletes glycogen stored in the male. Transfer of [14C]glucose from the male to the copulating female was demonstrated over a period of minutes. A considerable portion of the glucose utilized by the female during her life may be supplied by the male."

Although both manipulations improved visual acuity, removal of the nondeprived eye was associated with more rapid recovery and higher final acuity than in reverse suture.

Stereoselectivity was detected when the nucleobase was a purine (adenosine, deoxyadenosine. adenosine 3′-monophosphate. adenosine 5′-monophosphate, adenosine 3′, 5′-monophosphate, and guanosine), but was not detected with the pyrimidine derivative uridine. For a given nucleobase (adenine), all changes in the ribose moiety affected the resolution factors, which ranged between 1.03 and 1.074. These results might be relevant to the enantioselectivity of carcinogenic metabolites of polyaromatic hydrocarbons."

The ova ovulated in vitro (N = 56) were recovered and cultured and then transferred to the oviducts of six previously mated Dutch Belted hosts. Twelve of the resulting 36 offspring (33.3 percent) were white. In control matings between 12 Dutch Belted females (six randomly selected and the six hosts) and New Zealand White males, only one of 80 (1.2 percent) offspring was white. These data indicate that ova ovulated in vitro can be transferred to the oviduct of a host rabbit where they may be fertilized and after implantation may develop into viable embryos."

https://openalex.org/W1532132536,"Saccharomyces kluyveri cells were mutagenized with ethylmethane sulfonate and, after the cells had grown a few divisions to express any altered cell-surface antigenic structure, the culture was treated with rabbit antiserum directed against the wild type cells in order to enrich for mutants that failed to precipitate with the serum. Several mutant clones were obtained that proved to be altered in the carbohydrate component of the cell-wall mannoprotein. Whereas the wild type strain produces mannoprotein with carbohydrate side chains up to 8 mannose units in length (Zhang, W.-J., and Ballou, C. E. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10073-10079), one of the mutants (designated mnn1) has side chains no longer than 3 mannoses. From a comparison of the carbohydrate structures of the mutant and wild type mannoproteins by beta-elimination, acetolysis, and methylation, it appears that this mutant is unable to add mannose in alpha 1 leads to 3 linkage to the alpha 1 leads to 2-linked di- and trisaccharide side chains, thus preventing elongation and branching of the chains that occur in the wild type. Another mutant, designated mnn2, was unable to make the octasaccharide chain, whereas a third class made oligosaccharides of all sizes but did so in ratios that differed from the wild type. These three classes of mutants involve different loci because they complemented each other in the heterozygous diploids."
