https://openalex.org/W2061327866,"Neoplastic transformation has been associated with a variety of structural changes in cell surface carbohydrates, most notably increased sialylation and beta 1-6-linked branching of complex-type asparagine (Asn)-linked oligosaccharides (that is, -GlcNAc beta 1-6Man alpha 1-6Man beta 1-). However, little is known about the relevant glycoproteins or how these transformation-related changes in oligosaccharide biosynthesis may affect the malignant phenotype. Here it is reported that a cell surface glycoprotein, gp 130, is a major target of increased beta 1-6-linked branching and that the expression of these oligosaccharide structures is directly related to the metastatic potential of the cells. Glycosylation mutants of a metastatic tumor cell line were selected that are deficient in both beta 1-6 GlcNAc transferase V activity and metastatic potential in situ. Moreover, induction of increased beta 1-6 branching in clones of a nonmetastatic murine mammary carcinoma correlated strongly with acquisition of metastatic potential. The results indicate that increased beta 1-6-linked branching of complex-type oligosaccharides on gp 130 may be an important feature of tumor progression related to increased metastatic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2110090133,"Electrophoretic separation of ribonucleoprotein particles in a nondenaturing gel was used to analyze the splicing of mRNA precursors. Early in the reaction, a complex formed consisting of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) bound to sequences upstream of the 3' splice site. This complex is modeled as a precursor of a larger complex, the spliceosome, which contains U2, U4/6, and U5 snRNPs. Conversion of the U2 snRNP-precursor RNA complex to the spliceosome probably involves binding of a single multi-snRNP particle containing U4/6 and U5 snRNPs. The excised intron was released in a complex containing U5, U6, and probably U2 snRNPs. Surprisingly, U4 snRNP was not part of the intron-containing complex, suggesting that U4/6 snRNP disassembles and assembles during splicing. Subsequently, the reassembled U4/6 snRNP would associate with U5 snRNP and participate in de novo spliceosome formation. U1 snRNP was not detected in any of the splicing complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2057788173,"D1 and D2 dopamine receptors exert synergistic effects on the firing rates of basal ganglia neurons and on the expression of stereotyped behavior in rats. Moreover, the ability of D2 agonists to induce changes in basal ganglia single unit activity and spontaneous motor activity is dependent upon the presence of endogenous dopamine to stimulate D1 receptors; in rats treated with alpha-methyl-rho-tyrosine to reduce endogenous dopamine levels, the neurophysiological and behavioral effects of the D2 agonist quinpirole are significantly attenuated, while the effects of nonselective agonists like apomorphine, which stimulate both D1 and D2 receptors, or combinations of a D2 agonist and a D1 agonist are not attenuated. Thus, the previously held view that D2 receptors alone are responsible for evoking the changes in behavior and basal ganglia output induced by nonselective dopamine agonists and endogenous dopamine is not supported by these results, which indicate that these phenomena require concurrent stimulation of both dopamine receptor subtypes."

https://openalex.org/W1484619869,"The effect of oral administration of vanadate, in normalizing blood glucose levels of streptozotocin-treated rats (ST-rats), is further characterized and its mode of action is determined. We have examined the effects of two orally administered doses of sodium metavanadate. High concentrations of orally administered (0.8 mg/ml in drinking water) reduced blood glucose levels within 2-4 days of application and led to the appearance of hypoglycemia in test animals. Lower concentrations of (0.2 mg/ml in drinking water) also lowered blood glucose levels within 4 days, but did not lead to hypoglycemia for at least 3 weeks. These effects of were found to be reversible; hyperglycemia recurred within 2 days after removal of from the drinking water. In streptozotocin-treated rats receiving treatment, circulating levels of were about 0.8 microgram/ml after 3 weeks of treatment. These rats became anabolic, while rats receiving high treatment remained catabolic. Subsequent to treatment, adipocytes derived from ST-rats responded to lower insulin concentrations. In addition, treatment lowered the increased insulin binding capacity of liver plasma membranes derived from ST-rats. Insulin binding capacity under these conditions approached that of control non-ST-rats. Basal rates of hexose uptake in muscle and liver tissues were doubled in vanadate-treated ST-rats. It is concluded that the oral administration of leads to normoglycemia by stimulating glucose uptake. Treatment with low vanadate leads to the formation of a stable anabolic and normoglycemic state in ST-rats and appears to restore insulin responsiveness of target tissues, without apparent signs of toxicity. Vanadate treatment did not impair either kidney or liver function, as assayed by the measurement of serum urea, creatinine, and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase."
https://openalex.org/W1518396254,"Abstract P-57 is a neural-specific calmodulin binding protein with novel calmodulin binding properties. P-57 exhibits higher affinity for calmodulin-Sepharose in the absence of free Ca2+ than in the presence of Ca2+ (Andreasen, T.J., Luetje, C.W., Heideman, W. & Storm, D.R. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 4615-4618; Cimler, B. M., Andreasen, T.J., Andreasen, K.I. & Storm, D.R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10784-10788). In this study, the dissociation constants for P-57 and immunopurified 5-[[(iodoacetylamino)ethyl]-amino]-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid-labeled calmodulin (AEDANS-CaM) were determined under low and high ionic strength conditions. In the absence of added KCl, the dissociation constants for the P-57 X AEDANS-CaM complex were 2.3 X 10(-7) +/- 6 X 10(-8) M and 1.0 X 10(-6) +/- 3 X 10(-7) M in the presence and absence of excess Ca2+ chelator. The addition of KCl to 150 mM increased the Ca2+-independent and -dependent dissociation constants to 3.4 X 10(-6) +/- 9 X 10(-7) M and 3.0 X 10(-6) +/- 9 X 10(-7) M, respectively. The association of P-57 with AEDANS-CaM under low Ca2+ conditions was determined as a function of KCl concentrations. By taking into account the amount of P-57 found in brain and its affinity for calmodulin, it is concluded that most or all of the CaM would be complexed to P-57 in unstimulated cells. P-57 was phosphorylated by the Ca2+-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) with a phosphate:protein molar ratio of 1.3. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated phosphorylation at a serine residue. CaM decreased the rate of phosphorylation of P-57 by protein kinase C, and phosphorylation prevented P-57 binding to calmodulin-Sepharose. P-57 was not phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. It is proposed that P-57 binds and localizes calmodulin at specific sites within the cell and that free calmodulin is released locally in response to phosphorylation of P-57 by protein kinase C and/or to increases in intracellular free Ca2+. This regulatory mechanism, which appears to be specific to brain, would serve to decrease the response time for Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated processes."

https://openalex.org/W2044060614,"Replication initiation in bacteriophage lambda appears to require wrapping of origin DNA on an approximately 50 angstrom radius in or around the complex with the initiator protein O. Since short lengths of DNA are not that flexible, it may be that runs of coherently spaced deoxyadenylate residues constitute bend sites in the ori sequence that facilitate the process. Earlier data showed that ori DNA has electrophoretic anomalies characteristic of bend sites and that these are augmented by initiator protein binding. Here origin bending is examined by direct measurement of the ability of polymerized ori sequences to form small circles. The smallest circles observed (84 residues) are compatible with the required radius of curvature. Bend sites within the O protein binding sites, bend sites in the spacers between them, plus the inherent flexibility of non-bent DNA in the origin may all contribute to origin bending. The data also show that a bend site is required for O protein binding to DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1586330982,"Lipocortin I is a high affinity substrate for the epidermal growth factor receptor/kinase that can be purified by reversible Ca2+-dependent association with cellular particulate fractions. Purified human lipocortin I was shown by ultraviolet spectroscopy to undergo conformational changes in response to high concentrations of Ca2+ (30-700 microM). Equilibrium dialysis of lipocortin I alone against 45Ca2+ showed barely detectable binding at 5-60 microM Ca2+. However, in the presence of phosphatidylserine, binding was significantly enhanced, and Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed that lipocortin I contained four Ca2+-binding sites with an apparent Kd of 75 microM. Lipocortin I associated with phosphatidylserine vesicles and F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner with half-maximal association occurring at 22 and 180 microM Ca2+, respectively. Neither phosphatidylcholine vesicles nor intact cultured fibroblasts bound detectable amounts of lipocortin I. Phosphorylation of lipocortin I by the epidermal growth factor-stimulated kinase in A431 membranes required Ca2+ (half-maximum = 28 microM) in the presence of Mg2+, but phosphorylation was not Ca2+-dependent in the presence of Mn2+. The difference in Ca2+ requirement for phosphorylation probably is a reflection of the fact that Mn2+, but not Mg2+, promoted the association of lipocortin I with phospholipid. Although the physiological role of lipocortin I phosphorylation has not yet been determined, it was observed that phosphorylation of Tyr-21 reduced by 5-fold the amount of Ca2+ required for half-maximal association of the protein with phosphatidylserine vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1605349637,"Attachment of bacteria to the host tissue is considered a first step in the development of many infections. Previous studies have shown that fibronectin, a protein shown to mediate substrate adhesion of eukaryotic cells, also binds to some pathogenic bacteria and mediates the tissue adherence of these prokaryotes. In the present communication, we report on the isolation and characterization of a fibronectin receptor from Staphylococcus aureus strain Newman. A 210-kDa fibronectin binding protein was isolated from a bacterial lysate by affinity chromatography followed by gel chromatography. Additional smaller peptides with fibronectin binding properties were also obtained. These peptides seem to represent degradation products of the large receptor protein since the former dominated when the purification was carried out in the absence of protease inhibitors. Furthermore, degradation of the purified receptor protein by staphylococcal V8 protease generated a large number of peptides that retained fibronectin binding activity. This observation also suggests that the large receptor protein contains several binding sites for fibronectin, and analysis of the binding of the 29-kDa amino-terminal fibronectin fragment to the 210-kDa receptor adsorbed in microtiter wells suggests that one receptor molecule can bind six to nine fibronectin molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1554606831,"Primary cultures of neuronal and glial cells from 1-day-old neonatal rats contain high affinity receptors for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). The IC50 for displacement of 125I-IGF-I binding by unlabeled IGF-I was 3 nM for neuronal cells and 4 nM for glial cells. Unlabeled insulin was 20-50 times less potent. Apparent molecular mass of the alpha subunits of the IGF-I receptor was 125 kDa in neuronal and 135 kDa in glial cells. IGF-I induced autophosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor beta subunit in lectin-purified membrane preparations in a dose-dependent manner. The major phosphoamino acid of the beta subunit in both cell types was tyrosine in the IGF-I-stimulated state and serine in the basal state. Apparent molecular mass of the beta subunits of the IGF-I receptors was 91 kDa for neuronal and 95 kDa for glial cells. Tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-I receptors was demonstrated by IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 in both cell types. IGF-I had no effect on 2-deoxyglucose uptake in neuronal cells. In contrast, in glial cells, IGF-I stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake at very high doses, presumably acting via the insulin receptor. The effect of IGF-I as a neurotrophic growth factor in both neuronal and glial cells was demonstrated by its stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation. These findings suggest the IGF-I is an important growth factor in nervous tissue-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W1497575646,"The mannose permease of the bacterial phosphotransferase system mediates sugar transport across the cytoplasmic membrane concomitant with sugar phosphorylation. It also functions as a receptor for bacterial chemotaxis and is required for infection of the cell by bacteriophage lambda where it most likely functions as a pore for penetration of lambda DNA. The permease consists of three different subunits, IIIMan, II-PMan, and II-MMan, which are encoded in a single transcriptional unit ptsLPM. The complete amino acid sequence of the subunits is deduced from the nucleotide sequence. IIIMan (35 kDa) is a hydrophilic protein which is transiently phosphorylated and most likely contains the active site for sugar phosphorylation. II-PMan (28 kDa) is very hydrophobic; II-MMan (31 kDa) is moderately hydrophobic. Both are integral membrane proteins and most likely form the transmembrane channel. All three subunits are required for sugar transport and phosphorylation; II-PMan and II-MMan alone are sufficient for penetration of lambda DNA. Truncated forms of II-MMan and II-PMan are described that mediate lambda DNA penetration but have no apparent sugar transport activity. Residual sugar phosphorylation activity is found with the truncated form of II-PMan. No obvious homologies at the level of amino acid sequence could be detected with other bacterial transport proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1916528130,"Disruption of the yeast CHS1 gene, which encodes trypsin-activable chitin synthase I, yielded strains that apparently lacked chitin synthase activity in vitro, yet contained normal levels of chitin (Bulawa, C. E., Slater, M., Cabib, E., Au-Young, J., Sburlati, A., Adair, W. L., and Robbins, P. W. (1986) Cell 46, 213-225). It is shown here that disrupted (chs1 :: URA3) strains have a particulate chitin synthetic activity, chitin synthase II, and that wild type strains, in addition to chitin synthase I, have this second activity. Chitin synthase II is measured in wild type strains without preincubation with trypsin, the condition under which highest chitin synthase II activities are obtained in extracts from the chs1 :: URA3 strain. Chitin synthase II, like chitin synthase I, uses UDP-GlcNAc as substrate and synthesizes alkali-insoluble chitin (with a chain length of about 170 residues). The enzymes are equally sensitive to the competitive inhibitor Polyoxin D. The two chitin synthases are distinct in their pH and temperature optima, and in their responses to trypsin, digitonin, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and Co2+. In contrast to the report by Sburlati and Cabib (Sburlati, A., and Cabib, E. (1986) Fed. Proc. 45, 1909), chitin synthase II activity in vitro is usually lowered on treatment with trypsin, indicating that chitin synthase II is not activated by proteolysis. Chitin synthase II shows highest specific activities in extracts from logarithmically growing cultures, whereas chitin synthase I, whether from growing or stationary phase cultures, is only measurable after trypsin treatment, and levels of the zymogen do not change. Chitin synthase I is not required for alpha-mating pheromone-induced chitin synthesis in MATa cells, yet levels of chitin synthase I zymogen double in alpha factor-treated cultures. Specific chitin synthase II activities do not change in pheromone-treated cultures. It is proposed that of yeast's two chitin synthases, chitin synthase II is responsible for chitin synthesis in vivo, whereas nonessential chitin synthase I, detectable in vitro only after trypsin treatment, may not normally be active in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2148719100,The expression of the E2A transcription unit of the adenovirus E1A deletion mutant dl312 in murine embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells suggests that they contain an activity that will complement viral E1A. We have prepared from these cells in vitro transcription extracts that use E1A-inducible promoters more efficiently than do extracts from a differentiated cell line. Mixing experiments demonstrate that the EC phenotype is dominant. Gel retardation assays using the E2A promoter detect a binding activity present in F9 and PCC4 EC cells but not in differentiated cells. Our data indicate that EC stem cells contain a transcription factor that is analogous to viral E1A and is likely to be involved in the control of cellular gene expression during differentiation.
https://openalex.org/W2033095578,"Skeletal muscle ventricles (SMVs) were constructed from canine latissimus dorsi and connected to a totally implantable mock circulation device. The SMVs, stimulated by an implantable pulse generator, pumped continuously for up to 8 weeks in free-running beagle dogs. Systolic pressures produced by the SMVs, initially of 139 +/- 7.2 mmHg and after 1 month of continuous pumping of 107 +/- 7 mmHg, were comparable to normal physiologic pressures in the adult beagles (114 +/- 21 mmHg). After 2 weeks of continuous pumping, the mean stroke work of the SMVs was 0.4 X 10(6) ergs, a performance that compares favorably with the animal's cardiac ventricles. This study shows that canine skeletal muscle which has not received prior training or electrical conditioning can perform sustained work at the high levels needed for an auxiliary cardiovascular pump. It might be possible eventually to use such muscle pumps in humans to assist the failing circulation and to provide support in children with certain types of congenital heart defects."
https://openalex.org/W1587239867,"Metabolically 35S- or 3H-labeled heparan sulfate was isolated from murine Reichert's membrane, an extraembryonic basement membrane produced by parietal endoderm cells, and from the basement membrane-producing Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor. The polysaccharides were subjected to structural analysis involving identification of products formed on deamination of the polysaccharides with nitrous acid. The polysaccharide from Reichert's membrane contained N- and O-sulfate groups in approximately equal proportions. It bound almost quantitatively and with high affinity to antithrombin. A high proportion of antithrombin-binding sequence was also indicated by the finding that 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residues accounted for about 10% of the total O-sulfate groups. In contrast, at least 80% of the sulfate residues in the heparan sulfate isolated from the mouse tumor were N-substituents. Only a minor proportion of this polysaccharide bound with high affinity to antithrombin, and no 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residues were detected. These results are discussed in relation to the possible functional role of heparan sulfate in basement membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1498292000,"The lysosomal enzyme, beta-hexosaminidase, is composed of two chains, alpha and beta. In Tay-Sachs disease, mutations in the gene encoding the alpha-chain produce a beta-hexosaminidase deficiency that results in the storage of its natural substrate, GM2 ganglioside. To obtain the background information for the eventual identification of the mutational errors in Tay-Sachs disease and to determine possible relationships between protein and gene structure, we have characterized the intron-exon organization of the human beta-hexosaminidase alpha-chain gene. Several overlapping clones were isolated from human genomic libraries constructed in cosmid and bacteriophage vectors. The cloned genomic DNA was analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping, Southern blotting, and DNA sequencing. It was determined that the alpha-chain gene is approximately 35 kilobases long and is split into 14 exons. Sequences which resemble the TATA and CAAT transcriptional regulatory motifs are present at the 5' end of the gene. Differential transcription or processing of the most 3' exon of the gene results in two alpha-chain mRNAs with different 3'-untranslated regions. The first exon of the gene encodes the amino-terminal portion of the alpha-chain which is removed during the proteolytic maturation of the enzyme, raising the possibility that this segment may exist as a functional domain."
https://openalex.org/W1524885316,"When recA protein binds cooperatively to single-stranded DNA to form filamentous nucleoprotein complexes, it becomes competent to hydrolyze ATP. No correlation exists between the ends of such complexes and the rate of ATP hydrolysis. ATP hydrolysis is not, therefore, restricted to the terminal subunits on cooperatively bound recA oligomers, but occurs throughout the complex. Similarly, during recA protein-promoted branch migration (during DNA strand exchange), ATP hydrolysis is not restricted to recA protein monomers at the branch point. DNA cofactors of lengths varying from 16 bases to over 12,000 bases support ATP hydrolysis. The maximum value of kcat at infinite DNA concentration is about 29/min independent of the length of the DNA cofactor. The apparent dissociation constant, however, is a strong function of DNA length, providing evidence for a minimum site size of 30-50 bases for efficient binding of recA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1500385831,"Smooth muscle contraction is controlled in part by the state of phosphorylation of myosin. A recently discovered actin and calmodulin-binding protein, named caldesmon, may also be involved in regulation of smooth muscle contraction. Caldesmon cross-links actin filaments and also inhibits actin-activated ATP hydrolysis by myosin, particularly in the presence of tropomyosin. We have studied the effect of caldesmon on the rate of hydrolysis of ATP by skeletal muscle myosin subfragment-1, a system in which phosphorylation of the myosin is not important in regulation. Caldesmon is a very effective inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis giving up to 95% inhibition. At low ionic strength (approximately 20 mM) this effect does not require smooth muscle tropomyosin, whereas at high ionic strength (approximately 120 mM) tropomyosin enhances the inhibitory activity of caldesmon at low caldesmon concentrations. Cross-linking of actin is not essential for inhibition of ATP hydrolysis to occur since at high ionic strength there is very little cross-linking as determined by a low speed sedimentation assay. Under all conditions examined, the decrease in the rate of ATP hydrolysis is accompanied by a decrease in the binding of myosin subfragment-1 to actin. Furthermore, caldesmon weakens the equilibrium binding of myosin subfragment-1 to actin in the presence of pyrophosphate. We conclude that caldesmon has a general weakening effect on the binding of skeletal muscle myosin subfragment-1 to actin and that this weakening in binding may be responsible for inhibition of ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1553806473,"Purified rat liver UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-D-mannoside beta 1-2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (Bendiak, B., and Schachter, H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5775-5783) has been characterized kinetically, and its substrate specificity and inhibition characteristics have been determined. Kinetic data indicate an ordered, or largely ordered sequential mechanism, with UDP-GlcNAc binding prior to the acceptor. The minimal acceptor structure required for full activity is: (Formula: see text) The acceptor molecule must have a terminal Man alpha 1-6 residue, and a terminal GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-3 branch to display any activity, but does not require the reducing GlcNAc residue, as the enzyme was about 50% as active after reduction of this residue to N-acetylglucosaminitol. Additional residues (Gal beta 1-4 on the GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-3 arm, or a bisecting GlcNAc beta 1-4 on the beta-Man residue) abolish catalytic activity. These results suggest a rigid order in the biosynthesis of all N-linked complex oligosaccharides (bisected and nonbisected bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary), since the enzyme must act to completion prior to the action of either UDP-Gal:GlcNAc beta 1-4 galactosyltransferase or N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III to make such structures. Inhibition studies with nucleotides, sugars, nucleotide-sugars, and their respective analogues revealed that analogues of UDP and UTP, in which the hydrogen at the 5 position of the uracil was substituted with -CH3, bromine, or mercury (as the mercaptide) were good reversible inhibitors of the enzyme, whereas substitution at other sites lessened the inhibitory potency, usually to a large degree."
https://openalex.org/W128307323,"A new affinity chromatography adsorbant, in which UDP-GlcNAc has been linked to thiopropyl-Sepharose at the 5 position of the uracil via a 5-mercuri mercaptide bond, was utilized to purify UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-D-mannoside beta 1-2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II 60,000-fold from rat liver. After extraction of rat liver membranes with Triton X-100, the enzyme was found to exist in two molecular weight forms of markedly differing size, separable on Sephadex G-200. The low Mr form was separated from the high Mr form on columns of CM-Sephadex and hydroxylapatite, and was further purified by sequential elutions with NaCl, UDP-GlcNAc, and EDTA from the 5-mercuri-UDP-GlcNAc affinity adsorbant. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified low Mr form under reducing conditions revealed two protein bands of Mr 48,000 and 43,000. The purified enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-GlcNAc to the compound: (Formula: see text) The high Mr form of the enzyme, which eluted in the void volume of Sephadex G-200, was resistant to a number of treatments in attempts to reduce its molecular weight. These results suggest that the high Mr form of the enzyme may represent either a complex which normally exists in Golgi membranes as a result of strong protein-protein interactions or a protein with one or more anchor segments."
https://openalex.org/W1563581237,"Abstract Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II or hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity with positive acidified serum test (HEMPAS) is a genetic disease caused by membrane abnormality. Previously we have found that Band 3 and Band 4.5 are not glycosylated by lactosaminoglycans in HEMPAS erythrocytes, whereas normally these proteins have lactosaminoglycans (Fukuda, M. N., Papayannopoulou, T., Gordon-Smith, E. C., Rochant, H., and Testa, U. (1984) Br. J. Haematol. 56, 55-68). In order to find out where glycosylation of lactosaminoglycans stops, we have analyzed the carbohydrate structures of HEMPAS Band 3. By fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and hydrazinolysis followed by exoglycosidase treatments, the following structure was elucidated: (formula; see text) N-Linked glycopeptides synthesized in vitro by reticulocyte microsomes from HEMPAS were shown to be predominantly the above short oligosaccharide, whereas those from normal reticulocytes contain large molecular weight carbohydrates. The N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II, which transfers N-acetylglucosamine to the C-2 position of the Man alpha 1----6Man beta 1----arm of the biantennary core structure, was therefore examined by using Man alpha 1----6(GlcNAc beta 1----2Man alpha 1----3)Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4GlcNAcol as an acceptor. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase II activity was demonstrated in the lymphocyte microsome fraction from normal individuals. However, this enzyme activity was found to be decreased in those from HEMPAS patients. These results suggest that the primary defect of HEMPAS lies in the lowered activity of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II."
https://openalex.org/W1559507787,"Highly reactive sulfhydryls, previously labeled with an iodoacetamide spin label on the Ca-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, were labeled with the fluorescent probe, 5-(2-[iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS), without loss of enzymatic activity. We have selectively measured the apparent distance of the more reactive site, relative to other site-specific probes at both the nucleotide and the high affinity calcium binding sites. Fluorescence energy transfer efficiencies from the donor IAEDANS to two acceptors: fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate or 2′,3′-O-(2,4,3-trinitrophenyl)adenosine monophosphate, situated at or near the nucleotide site, were measured using fluorescence lifetimes and yields. Fluorescence on polyacrylamide gels shows that the IAEDANS and fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate labels are both associated with the B tryptic fragment. The energy transfer measurements are consistent with distances of 56 and 68 A between IAEDANS and these respective binding sites. On the other hand, energy transfer measurements using the lanthanide, praseodymium (Pr3+), as an acceptor indicate that IAEDANS is located 16-18 A from the binding site(s) of this calcium analog. Pr3+ is shown to be a good analog for calcium binding to the high affinity sites on the enzyme since it competitively displaces calcium, as evidenced by the reversal of the specific calcium-dependent intrinsic fluorescent signal and inactivation of ATPase activity, over the same narrow range in Pr3+ concentration where energy transfer is observed. Our observations suggest that the portion of the B fragment spanning the cytoplasmic portion of the ATPase is folded onto the A fragment, bringing the IAEDANS label in close proximity to the high affinity calcium binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1531345947,"Human lipocortin I is a 38.5-kDa phospholipase A2 inhibitor that has been produced in Escherichia coli in large quantities by recombinant DNA technology (Wallner, B.P., Mattaliano, R.J., Hession, C., Cate, R.

To localize the region within the protein responsible for its inhibitory activity, we generated a series of fragments of the recombinant product by limited proteolysis with elastase and characterized their structure by sequencing and peptide mapping. Five active fragments have been analyzed in detail. The smallest is an 18-kDa fragment derived from the amino-terminal half of lipocortin. Three of the larger fragments contain this region. The fifth fragment is missing 83 amino acids from the amino terminus. A region common to all the active fragments (amino acid residues 97-178) is 70% homologous with the corresponding region from a second member of the lipocortin family which recently was cloned (Huang, K-S., Wallner, B.P., Mattaliano, R.J., Tizard, R., Burne, C., Frey, A., Hession, C., McGray, P., Sinclair, L.K., Chow, E.P., Browning, J.L., Ramachandran, K.L., Tang, J., Smart, J.E., and Pepinsky, R.B.

In addition to inhibitory fragments, we have isolated a 3-kDa proteolytic fragment from the amino terminus of lipocortin I that contains the known phosphorylation site for protein-tyrosine kinases. Because of sequence homology of the 3-kDa fragment with biologically active synthetic peptides from pp60v-src and middle T antigen, its release by proteases may represent an important part of the activity of lipocortin."

Analyses of the labeled proteoglycan samples with heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC indicated that Form LD is a large proteoglycan containing heparan sulfate chains attached to a single core molecule (Mr = 450,000), whereas Form HD is a mixture of small proteoglycans with four different size core molecules (Mr = 34,000, 29,000, 27,000, and 21,000), most, if not all, of which bear both heparan sulfate (Mr = 60,000) and chondroitin sulfate (Mr = 17,000) chains. Glycosaminoglycan-enriched fragments obtained from Form HD by V8 protease digestion were also shown to contain both heparitinase-susceptible chains and chondroitinase ABC-susceptible chains. Tryptic peptide maps of 125I-labeled Form HD and the glycosaminoglycan-enriched fragments derived therefrom were quite different from the corresponding maps for Form LD."

Of 48 detergents tested, optimal crystallization was obtained with Brij 36T, Brij 56, and Brij 96 at a detergent:protein weight ratio of 4:1 and with octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether at a ratio of 2:1. Similar Ca2+-induced crystalline arrays were obtained with the purified or delipidated Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum but at lower detergent:protein ratios. The crystals are stabilized by fixation with glutaraldehyde and persist even after the removal of phospholipids by treatment with phospholipases A or C and by extraction with organic solvents. The crystals obtained so far can be used only for electron microscopy, but ongoing experiments suggest that under similar conditions large ordered arrays may develop that are suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1513979592,"It has been suggested that vesicles derived from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle contain Ca2+ channels which can be opened by interaction with sulfhydryl reagents such as Ag+ or Hg2+. We show that, in reconstituted vesicles containing the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase purified from sarcoplasmic reticulum as the only protein, the ATPase can act as a pathway for Ca2+ efflux and that Ag+ induces a rapid release of Ca2+ from such reconstituted vesicles. We also show that Ag+ has a marked inhibitory effect on the ATPase activity of the purified ATPase. We suggest that the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase can act as a pathway for rapid Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1530239200,"Information about ligand binding, dissociation, internalization, and intracellular processing and about receptor turnover, processing, and insertion into the membrane is contained in the time-dependent changes in concentrations of membrane-associated and internalized ligand. Single experiments similar in design to those typically performed for Scatchard analyses of binding data conducted at physiological temperature and in the absence of inhibitors of ligand-receptor complex internalization and degradation can provide kinetic data sufficient to permit derivation of all the respective rate constants by numerical methods. We developed an analytical solution of the kinetic model which assumes that all of these processes follow first order kinetics. The model represents interactions of surface receptors (R)s, the surface ligand-receptor complex (LR)s and internalized receptor-ligand complex (LR)I: d[R]S/dt = Vr - kt[R]S - ka[L] [R]S + kd [LR]S; d[LR]S/dt = ka[L] [R]S - kd[LR]S - ke[LR]S; d[LR]I/dt = ke[LR]S - kh[LR]I; Vr is the constant rate of insertion of receptors into the membrane, kt is the internalization rate constant for free receptors, ka and kd are association and dissociation rate constants for ligand-surface receptor interaction, ke is the internalization rate constant for ligand-receptor complexes, and kh is the intracellular ligand decomposition rate constant. The interaction of radioiodinated human recombinant interferon-alpha 2a with the human alveolar lung carcinoma cell line, A549, was adequately accounted for by the model. The rate constants, numerically derived from time-dependent concentrations of surface-bound and internalized ligand of other systems taken from the literature, were in agreement with values of these rate constants individually measured by steady-state experiments. In cases where the fate of internalized radioactivity was more complex than assumed by the model, the parameters ka, kt, (kd + ke) and Vr could be derived from the time dependence of [LR]S."
https://openalex.org/W1489400645,"Abstract When mouse L cells are incubated with 32P-labeled recombinant murine immune interferon ( [32P]Mu-IFN-gamma) and subsequently cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate, a major complex with an apparent molecular mass of 95,000-125,000 daltons can be visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The complex was not formed when the binding was performed in the presence of excess unlabeled Mu-IFN-gamma or when Chinese hamster ovary cells were used. This complex therefore represents the Mu-IFN-gamma receptor (or its interferon-binding subunit). The chromosomal location of the Mu-IFN-gamma receptor (or the binding subunit of the receptor) gene, termed Ifgr, was identified by performing the binding and cross-linking reactions on a series of mouse-hamster somatic cell hybrids with different subsets of mouse chromosomes. The presence of mouse chromosome 10 was shown to be necessary and sufficient for the formation of the cross-linked complex. Thus, the gene coding for the binding subunit of the Mu-IFN-gamma receptor was localized to mouse chromosome 10. The presence of this chromosome in the hybrid cells was not sufficient, however, to confer antiviral resistance to the hybrids when they were treated with Mu-IFN-gamma and challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus."

The cross-linked complex in the absence of ATP has a rigor-like appearance. In contrast, both in the presence of ATP and after the N, N'-p-phenylenedimaleimide (pPDM) bridging of the reactive thiols of S-1, the covalently attached cross-bridges of the acto X S-1 complex appear more disordered and no longer assume the characteristic rigor 45 degrees angle with the actin filaments. The images both in the presence and absence of ATP bear a striking resemblance to those obtained by negative staining of the cross-linked acto X S-1 complex (Craig, R., Greene, L. E. & Eisenberg, E. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. A. 82, 3247-3251). The actin-bound pPDM S-1 complex, formed by treating the cross-linked complex with pPDM in the presence of ATP, is an expected analog of the weakly bound cross-bridge state. The disordered appearance of S-1 molecules of the cross-linked complex in the presence of ATP and after pPDM treatment may reflect the structural state of the weakly bound cross-bridge."
https://openalex.org/W1562804965,"The promoter region of the Neurospora crassa metallothionein gene contains no sequences which are similar to the mammalian or the yeast metal responsive elements (Munger, K., Germann, U. A., and Lerch, K. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 2665-2668). We therefore studied the regulation of expression of the N. crassa metallothionein gene in response to different metal ions (Cu2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+) by Northern analysis. Only copper led to the induction of metallothionein mRNA. In N. crassa cultures inoculated and grown in copper-supplemented media, metallothionein mRNA appeared during the late logarithmic growth period (about 30 h after inoculation) and was detectable for a time period of more than 30 h. In response to copper shock, however, rapidly increasing amounts of metallothionein mRNA were detected within minutes after copper administration at any time in vegetatively growing mycelia of N. crassa. Maximum levels were detected about 1 h after addition of copper to the medium. The half-life time of the mRNA was estimated as 2.5 h. The amounts of copper metallothionein reach a maximum level at 3 h after induction and thereafter remain constant. The rapid induction by copper ions of metallothionein mRNA and metallothionein together with the remarkable stability of the native protein intracellularly suggest that this protein serves an important homeostatic role in the copper metabolism in this fungus. The structural gene of N. crassa metallothionein has been located on chromosome VI using restriction fragment-length polymorphisms as genetic markers."

Chem. 256, 11209-11215) was incorporated into soybean phospholipid vesicles, together with its activator. In the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, the reconstituted proteoliposomes displayed a rapid, saturable, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake. Half-maximal Ca2+ uptake activity was observed at 13 +/- 3 nM free Ca2+, and the apparent Km for ATP was 16 +/- 6 microM. Ca2+ accumulated into proteoliposomes (2.8 +/- 0.2 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/90 s) was totally released upon addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A-23187. Ca2+ uptake into vesicles reconstituted with enzyme alone was stimulated 2-2.5-fold by the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activator, added exogenously. The (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activity of the reconstituted vesicles, measured using the same assay conditions as for ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activity (e.g. in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+), was maximally activated by 20 nM free Ca2+, half-maximal activation occurring at 13 nM free Ca2+. The stoichiometry of Ca2+ transport versus ATP hydrolysis approximated 0.3. These results provide a direct demonstration that the high affinity (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase identified in liver plasma membranes is responsible for Ca2+ transport."
https://openalex.org/W1539876119,"Recent studies have suggested that there is an organic cation-proton exchange mechanism in the renal brush border membrane which may be responsible for the active secretion of organic cations by the kidney. In all of these studies, the movement of organic cations was specifically monitored in the presence of a proton gradient. In this study, the organic cation-proton exchange mechanism in renal brush border membrane vesicles was examined by studying the movement of protons in the presence of favorable gradients of the organic cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA). Using acridine orange, a pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, we demonstrated that in isolated brush border membrane vesicles prepared from rabbit renal cortex, the rate of proton efflux increased with increasing inwardly directed gradients of TEA, although the efflux was saturable. An outwardly directed TEA gradient could also accelerate the influx of protons. The rate of exchange of protons for TEA was slower than that for Na+. This slower rate appears to be due to a lower Vmax of the exchange of organic cations with protons. These data provide more direct evidence for an exchange of organic cations with protons or a cotransport of organic cations and hydroxyl ions in the renal brush border membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1490866125,"The heparan sulfate proteoglycan of the bovine glomerular basement membrane (Mr = 200,000, 30% carbohydrate by weight) has been deglycosylated by various chemical and enzymatic procedures to identify the core protein and provide information about the N- and O-linked saccharide units. Heparitinase digestion of the proteoglycan reduced its Mr to 143,000, consistent with the removal of its four glycosaminoglycan chains with the exception of short segments adjacent to the carbohydrate-protein linkage region, whereas nitrous acid treatment brought about a smaller reduction in size (to Mr = 168,000) which was shown to be due to the resistance of the internal portion of the heparan sulfate polymer to this reagent. Incubation of the heparitinase-digested proteoglycan with peptide N-glycosidase F decreased its Mr by about 8,000 and liberated oligosaccharides which were primarily acidic in nature; since endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H did not bring about any saccharide release, it appears that the N-linked carbohydrate units (three per molecule) occur exclusively as the complex type. Treatment of the proteoglycan with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, a reagent which cleaves all saccharide units, yielded the core protein which migrated as a single discrete band (Mr = 128,000) on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Although the native and heparitinase-treated proteoglycan reacted with concanavalin A and Bandeiraea simplicifolia I, the core protein had no affinity for these lectins, and this loss of reactivity can be attributed to the removal of the N- and small O-linked saccharides. However, the immunoreactivity of the deglycosylated protein with antiserum directed against the intact proteoglycan was to a large measure (80%) preserved, suggesting that the polyclonal response to this glomerular basement membrane glycoconjugate is primarily directed against determinants on the polypeptide portion."
https://openalex.org/W1561414866,"The human T cell receptor-T3 antigen complex is composed of at least five polypeptide chains. In addition to the 45-kDa/50-kDa heterodimer (alpha and beta chains) of the T cell receptor, the complex includes 25-kDa (T3-gamma) and 20-kDa (T3-delta) glycoproteins and a nonglycosylated 20-kDa (T3-epsilon) protein. Here we report that in pulse-chase biosynthetic labeling experiments we detect a new polypeptide chain (T3-p28) which is associated with the T3-delta and T3-epsilon chains during biosynthesis but not on the cell surface. T3-p28, which is not recognized by anti-T3 antibodies, can be chemically distinguished from the previously described T3-gamma chain. The carboxylic ionophore monensin blocks the apparent dissociation of T3-p28 from the T3-delta and T3-epsilon chains. Peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as all T cell leukemic lines tested contain T3-p28, except one HPB-ALL subline. Since the T3-p28 protein is only observed early in biosynthesis of T3-delta and T3-epsilon, it may function in intracellular transport or assembly of the T cell receptor-T3 complex."

(1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5498-5504). By oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis within the coding region for the NH2-terminal 44-residue domain of BoIFN-alpha C, we replaced up to 18 residues by the corresponding HuIFN-alpha J1 residues. (HuIFN-alpha J1 is less than 60% homologous in sequence to BoIFN-alpha C.) The nine different bovine-human-IFN alpha hybrids obtained were compared to BoIFN-alpha C and HuIFN-alpha J1 with respect to their potential to induce an antiviral state, synthesis of 2-5A-synthetase, and their specific binding to human and bovine cells. Relative to BoIFN-alpha C, a gradual increase in biological activities (antiviral or 2-5A-synthetase) of approximately 10-, 10(2)-, 10(3)-, and approximately 10(4)-fold is obtained, depending on the number and positions of the residues substituted. A direct correlation exists between biological response and ability of IFN alpha to bind specifically to human cells. A BoIFN alpha molecule mutated in the 10-44 NH2-terminal domain was obtained which is 15, 8, and 35% as active as HuIFN-alpha J1 on human cells in specific binding, induction of antiviral, and 2-5A-synthetase activities, respectively. We concluded that at least 5 of the 12 residues at positions 10; 21, 22, 24; 27; 31, 34, 35, 37, 40; 42, 43 in the 10-44 NH2-terminal domain are critical for recognition of the human IFN-alpha cell receptor and for biological activity. These residues are found among 10 strictly conserved residues in all reported mammalian IFN alpha S, and they act in a cooperative manner to induce a biological response in human cells. The gap between the extent of improvement in binding capacity of the BoIFN alpha mutants on human cells and the corresponding biological response suggests that the primary signal of binding to the cell receptor is amplified within the cell. On bovine cells, HuIFN-alpha J1 and BoIFN-alpha C also compete for the same receptor, and it seems that at least part of the 10-44 NH2-terminal domain on IFN alpha is also involved in interaction with the bovine IFN alpha cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1588335694,"Relaxation of both smooth and skeletal muscles appears to be caused primarily by inhibition of the step associated with Pi release in the actomyosin ATPase cycle, rather than by a block in the binding of the myosin X ATP and myosin X ADP X Pi complexes to actin. In skeletal muscle, troponin-tropomyosin not only causes marked inhibition of Pi release, but it also markedly inhibits the binding of myosin subfragment-1 X ADP to actin, raising the possibility that the two phenomena are coupled in some way. In the present study we determined whether phosphorylation of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) also affects both the binding of HMM X ADP to actin and the Pi release step. This was done by having phosphorylated and unphosphorylated HMM X ADP compete for sites on F-actin. At mu = 30 mM, phosphorylation increased the affinity of the HMM molecule for actin about 12-fold and at mu = 170 mM, there was less than a 3-fold increase in the affinity of HMM. If phosphorylation affects the binding of each head of HMM to the same extent, then phosphorylation caused about a 4- and 2-fold increase in the affinity of each head of HMM for actin at mu = 30 and 170 mM, respectively. In contrast, at both ionic strengths, phosphorylation caused more than 100-fold actin activation of the ATPase activity of smooth muscle HMM. Therefore, the marked activation of Pi release in the acto X HMM ATPase cycle upon phosphorylation of HMM is not accompanied by a comparable increase in the affinity of HMM X ADP for actin. We have also found that phosphorylation increases by only 4-fold the rate of Pi release from HMM alone. These results suggest that in smooth muscle, phosphorylation accelerates the step associated with the release of Pi both in the forward and the reverse direction without correspondingly affecting the binding of myosin X ADP to actin."
https://openalex.org/W1594632513,"Synaptic plasma membranes isolated from rat brain exhibited a Ca2+ transport process that was strictly dependent on the presence of Mg2+ and activated by ATP hydrolysis. The characteristics of this ATP-activated transport process included a high affinity for Ca2+ and ATP with the Kact for these two substrates being 0.7 and 5 microM, respectively, and a lower affinity for Mg2+, Kact = 54 microM. The estimated constants for ATP-activated Ca2+ transport into synaptic membrane vesicles and the dependence of such transport on Mg2+ were indicative that such transport was related to the previously described high affinity (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase in synaptic membranes. An ATP- and Mg2+-dependent Ca2+ transport process with very similar kinetic characteristics was present also in a general microsomal membrane fraction obtained from brain tissue. The synaptic and microsomal membrane ATP-activated transport processes exhibited differences in their sensitivity to vanadate inhibition. Interaction with vanadate was fairly complex and best analyzed by a two-component model. Thus, the estimated Ki values for vanadate were 0.2 and 6.6 microM for the synaptic membranes and 0.7 and 13.8 microM for the microsomes. Since the microsomal membranes contain a substantial population of intraneuronal endoplasmic reticulum vesicles, the effects of vanadate on Ca2+ transport into intraneuronal membrane organelles, other than mitochondria, was determined in saponin-permeabilized synaptosomes. The estimated Ki values for vanadate inhibition of Ca2+ transport activity were 0.7 and 13 microM. The accumulation of Ca2+ into synaptic plasma membrane vesicles was readily reversed by activation of the Na+-Ca2+ exchange carrier, whereas the Ca2+ associated with intrasynaptosomal organelles was not affected by changes in [Na+]. Thus, there are at least two ATP-dependent Ca2+ transporting processes localized on two distinct neuronal membranes, one on the plasma membrane and the second on intraneuronal membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1537362115,"Brief exposure of rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase to Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease results in the release from the enzyme of two carboxyl-terminal peptides from the enzyme that together comprise 17 amino acids. The rate of proteolysis was increased in the presence of activators of the enzyme, ammonium sulfate and AMP, and was decreased in the presence of allosteric inhibitors, MgATP and citrate. No change was observed in the maximal velocity of the modified enzyme or in its affinity for substrates when assayed under noninhibitory conditions. Equilibrium binding studies indicated no change in the affinity of the modified enzyme for its allosteric activator, AMP. On the other hand, the proteolyzed enzyme exhibited markedly reduced inhibition by ATP and by citrate. ATP inhibition was observed only at very high concentrations of ATP. Fructose-6-P saturation curves of the modified enzyme were nearly hyperbolic. The interaction coefficient deduced from the slope of a Hill-type plot was 1.2 under conditions that yielded a coefficient of 3.0 with native phosphofructokinase. Binding studies verified a decrease in affinity for ATP for at least one of the ATP binding sites. Because kinetic studies showed no effect on the Km for ATP, it was concluded that the affinity was decreased at the MgATP inhibitory site only. Proteolytic removal of the terminal 8 residues from the enzyme produced no striking change in regulatory properties, thus focusing the critical region to the sequence His-Ala-His-Leu-Glu-His-Ile-Ser-Arg. It is suggested that the three histidine residues clustered in the carboxyl terminus may contribute to the binding of MgATP to the inhibitory site."
https://openalex.org/W1639663403,"Enhanced fluorescence of the ATP analogue 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexyldienylidine)adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP), bound to the Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, is closely related to phosphoenzyme levels (Bishop, J. E., Johnson, J. D., and Berman, M. C. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15163-15171) and has an emission maximum consistent with decreased polarity of the TNP-ATP-binding site. The phosphoenzyme conformation responsible for increased nucleotide-binding site hydrophobicity has been studied by redistribution of phosphoenzyme intermediates following specific thiol group modification. N-Ethylmaleimide, in the presence of 50 microM Ca2+, 1 mM adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, pH 7.0, at 25 degrees C for 30 min, selectively modified the SH group essential for phosphoenzyme decomposition, which resulted in decreased ATPase activity, Ca2+ uptake, and a decrease in ATP-induced TNP-ATP fluorescence. Phosphorylated (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase levels from [gamma-32P] ATP remained relatively unaffected (3.1 nmol/mg), but the ADP-insensitive fraction decreased from 56 to 15%. Phosphoenzyme levels from 32Pi were also decreased to the same extent as turnover, with equivalent loss of Pi-induced TNP-ATP fluorescence. The E1 to E2 transition, as monitored by the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, was unaffected. Modification of thiol groups of unknown function did not modify turnover-induced TNP-ATP fluorescence. It is concluded that the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme, E2-P, is responsible for enhanced TNP-ATP fluorescence. This suggests that the conformational transition, 2Ca2+outE1 approximately P----2Ca2+inE2-P, is associated with altered properties of the noncatalytic, or regulatory, nucleotide-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1586588060,"Application of the myosin competition test (Lehman, W., and Szent-Gyorgyi, A. G. (1975) J. Gen. Physiol. 66, 1-30) to chicken gizzard actomyosin indicated that this smooth muscle contains a thin filament-linked regulatory mechanism. Chicken gizzard thin filaments, isolated as described previously (Marston, S. B., and Lehman, W. (1985) Biochem. J. 231, 517-522), consisted almost exclusively of actin, tropomyosin, caldesmon, and an unidentified 32-kilodalton polypeptide in molar ratios of 1:1/6:1/26:1/17, respectively. When reconstituted with phosphorylated gizzard myosin, these thin filaments conferred Ca2+ sensitivity (67.8 +/- 2.1%; n = 5) on the myosin Mg2+-ATPase. On the other hand, no Ca2+ sensitivity of the myosin Mg2+-ATPase was observed when purified gizzard actin or actin plus tropomyosin was reconstituted with phosphorylated gizzard myosin. Native thin filaments were rendered essentially free of caldesmon and the 32-kilodalton polypeptide by extraction with 25 mM MgCl2. When reconstituted with phosphorylated gizzard myosin, caldesmon-free thin filaments and native thin filaments exhibited approximately the same Ca2+ sensitivity (45.1 and 42.7%, respectively). The observed Ca2+ sensitivity appears, therefore, not to be due to caldesmon. Only trace amounts of two Ca2+-binding proteins could be detected in native thin filaments. These were identified as calmodulin (present at a molar ratio to actin of 1:733) and the 20-kilodalton light chain of myosin (present at a molar ratio to actin of 1:270). The Ca2+ sensitivity observed in an in vitro system reconstituted from gizzard thin filaments and either skeletal myosin or phosphorylated gizzard myosin is due, therefore, to calmodulin and/or an unidentified minor protein component of the thin filaments which may be an actin-binding protein involved in regulating actin filament structure in a Ca2+-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1600973233,"The hydrolytic cycle of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase in the absence of Ca2+ was studied. At pH 6.0, 10 degrees C and in the absence of K+, the enzyme displays a very low velocity of ATP hydrolysis. Addition of up to 15% dimethyl sulfoxide increased this velocity severalfold (from 5-18 nmol of Pi X mg of protein-1 X h-1) and then decreased at higher solvent concentrations. Dimethyl sulfoxide increased both enzyme phosphorylation from ATP and the affinity for this substrate. Maximal levels of 1.0-1.2 nmol of EP X mg of protein-1 and apparent KM for ATP of 5 × 10(-6) M were obtained at a concentration of 30% dimethyl sulfoxide. The same preparation under optimal conditions (pH 7.5, 10 microM CaCl2, 100 mM KCl and no dimethyl sulfoxide at 37 degrees C) displays a velocity of ATP hydrolysis between 8 and 12 × 10(5) nmol of Pi X mg of protein-1 X h-1 while the phosphoenzyme levels varied between 3.5 and 4.0 nmol of EP X mg of protein-1. Enzyme phosphorylation from ATP in the absence of Ca2+ always preceded Pi liberation into the assay media. Two different phosphoenzyme species were formed which were kinetically distinguished by their decomposition rates. The observed steady-state velocity of ATP hydrolysis could be accounted for either by the decay of the fast component or by the simultaneous decomposition of both phosphoenzyme species. The hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme formed in the absence of Ca2+ was KCl-stimulated and ADP-independent. The rate constant of breakdown was equal to that observed for the phosphoenzyme formed in the presence of Ca2+. It is suggested that the rapidly decaying phosphoenzyme (and possibly both rapidly and slowly decaying species) are intermediates in the reaction cycle of Mg2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and may represent a bypass of Ca2+ activation by dimethyl sulfoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1513060393,"One of the essential catalytic components of the clostridial glycine reductase complex is a selenium-containing protein, selenoprotein A. An improved method for the purification of selenoprotein A has been developed that yields milligram quantities of the protein in a few relatively simple steps. Ferredoxin and rubredoxin can be recovered in pure form as by-products of the procedure. The high resolving capabilities of an anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography step were exploited in these purification protocols. For effective antibody production, the antigenicity of selenoprotein A was increased by coupling the pure protein via its sulfhydryl/selenol group(s) to the amino groups of bovine serum albumin using m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. The high titer sheep antisera that were elicited were used to study the mechanisms of selenium incorporation into selenoprotein A. Immunoblot analysis of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels was employed to monitor the synthesis of selenoprotein A by Clostridium sticklandii as a function of growth conditions. Cells grown under limiting conditions (1 nM) of selenium contained only 1-2% of normal levels of active selenoprotein A and no precursor forms were detected after DEAE-high pressure liquid chromatography fractionation of extracts. Conversely, cells grown with optimal (1 microM) selenium levels contained maximal amounts of seleno-protein A and expressed full glycine reductase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1597900073,"Digestion of mannose 6-phosphate receptor preparations with trypsin and chymotrypsin was found to produce characteristic polypeptide fingerprints of the receptor. Lengthy digestions with both proteases produced fragments of the receptor which appeared to be resistant to further proteolysis. This suggests the occurrence of distinct structural domains within the receptor protein. Liposome-associated mannose 6-phosphate receptor preparations were made using phosphatidylcholine and purified receptor. Receptor molecules were oriented in the liposomes with greater than 90% of ligand-binding sites on the outside surfaces of the liposomes. Liposome-associated mannose 6-phosphate receptor was labeled with 125I at pH 7.5 and 5.4 in the presence or absence of sugar phosphate ligands. Limited trypsin digestion was used to analyze 125I-labeled receptor preparations. Peptide fragments having molecular weights of approximately 60,000 and 23,000 were found to be most prominently labeled. At pH 7.5 the labeling of the 60-kDa fragment was enhanced strongly by the presence of mannose 6-phosphate. This ligand-induced enhancement of 125I-labeling was saturable, had a K1/2 value of 0.4 mM, required the presence of phosphatidylcholine, and did not occur at pH 5.4. Incorporation of 125I into both polypeptide fragments was significantly reduced at pH 5.4. These results suggest the occurrence of ligand- and pH-dependent conformational changes in domains of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor which may be necessary for proper function of this membrane receptor in receptor-mediated endocytosis."

The increase in 45Ca2+ washout resulting from increased [K+]o also was blocked by 2 mM cobalt or 10 microM verapamil. Inhibitors of vascular tone (nitroprusside, atriopeptin II), arachidonic acid metabolism (indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid), and alpha- or beta-adrenergic or muscarinic nerve stimulation/secretion (phentolamine, propranolol, atropine) were unable to inhibit the [K+]o-stimulated glucose release. ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations in tissue freeze-clamped 2 min after the onset of infusion of 50 mM K+ were not significantly different from control tissue. Glucose release from freshly isolated suspensions or primary cultured monolayers of hepatocytes or from liver slices, all of which responded to glucagon or phenylephrine, did not respond to increased [K+]o. The results indicate that glycogenolysis stimulated by depolarizing gradients of K+ is dependent on an intact perfused vasculature and may be mediated by potential-sensitive Ca2+ channels present in the vascular endothelium of the liver."
https://openalex.org/W1508846714,"Citrulline is synthesized in mitochondria of Neurospora crassa from ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate. In mycelia grown in minimal medium, carbamoyl phosphate limits citrulline (and arginine) synthesis. Addition of arginine to such cultures reduces the availability of intramitochondrial ornithine, and ornithine then limits citrulline synthesis. We have found that for some time after addition of excess arginine, carbamoyl phosphate synthesis continued. Very little of this carbamoyl phosphate escaped the mitochondrion to be used in the pyrimidine pathway in the nucleus. Instead, mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate accumulated over 40-fold and turned over rapidly. This was true in ornithine- or ornithine carbamoyltransferase-deficient mutants and in normal mycelia during feedback inhibition of ornithine synthesis. The data suggest that the rate of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis is dependent to a large extent upon the specific activity of the slowly and incompletely repressible synthetic enzyme, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase A. In keeping with this conclusion, we found that when carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase A was repressed 2-10-fold by growth of mycelia in arginine, carbamoyl phosphate was still synthesized in excess of that used for residual citrulline synthesis. Again, only a small fraction of the excess carbamoyl phosphate could be accounted for by diversion to the pyrimidine pathway. The continued synthesis and turnover of carbamoyl phosphate in mitochondria of arginine-grown cells may allow rapid resumption of citrulline formation after external arginine disappears and no longer exerts negative control on ornithine biosynthesis."
