https://openalex.org/W2175948239,"Rice, one of the world's most important food plants, has important syntenic relationships with the other cereal species and is a model plant for the grasses. Here we present a map-based, finished quality sequence that covers 95% of the 389 Mb genome, including virtually all of the euchromatin and two complete centromeres. A total of 37,544 non-transposable-element-related protein-coding genes were identified, of which 71% had a putative homologue in Arabidopsis. In a reciprocal analysis, 90% of the Arabidopsis proteins had a putative homologue in the predicted rice proteome. Twenty-nine per cent of the 37,544 predicted genes appear in clustered gene families. The number and classes of transposable elements found in the rice genome are consistent with the expansion of syntenic regions in the maize and sorghum genomes. We find evidence for widespread and recurrent gene transfer from the organelles to the nuclear chromosomes. The map-based sequence has proven useful for the identification of genes underlying agronomic traits. The additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats identified in our study should accelerate improvements in rice production."

https://openalex.org/W2123511906,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a pluripotent cell type that can differentiate into several distinct lineages. Two key transcription factors, Runx2 and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ), drive MSCs to differentiate into either osteoblasts or adipocytes, respectively. How these two transcription factors are regulated in order to specify these alternate cell fates remains a pivotal question. Here we report that a 14-3-3–binding protein, TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif), coactivates Runx2-dependent gene transcription while repressing PPARγ-dependent gene transcription. By modulating TAZ expression in model cell lines, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and primary MSCs in culture and in zebrafish in vivo, we observed alterations in osteogenic versus adipogenic potential. These results indicate that TAZ functions as a molecular rheostat that modulates MSC differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2126812637,"Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (Apoer2), a member of the LDL receptor gene family, and its ligand Reelin control neuronal migration during brain development. Apoer2 is also essential for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the adult brain. Here we show that Apoer2 is present in the postsynaptic densities of excitatory synapses where it forms a functional complex with NMDA receptors. Reelin signaling through Apoer2 markedly enhances LTP through a mechanism that requires the presence of amino acids encoded by an exon in the intracellular domain of Apoer2. This exon is alternatively spliced in an activity-dependent manner and is required for Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits. Mice constitutively lacking the exon perform poorly in learning and memory tasks. Thus, alternative splicing of Apoer2, a novel component of the NMDA receptor complex, controls the modulation of NMDA receptor activity, synaptic neurotransmission, and memory by Reelin.

Cells use receptors at the plasma membrane to interact and communicate with the extracellular environment and with each other. This frequently involves the uptake of macromolecules through endocytosis, or coupling of the receptors to intracellular signaling pathways. Receptor specificity, intracellular trafficking, and signaling can be modulated by alternative and differential splicing, a mechanism thought to contribute to the increased functional complexity of the mammalian proteome (Black and Grabowski, 2003Black D.L.

The LDL receptor gene family constitutes a class of structurally closely related, yet remarkably versatile, multifunctional endocytic cell surface receptors that regulate a wide range of cellular signaling pathways (Strickland et al., 2002Strickland D.K.

Some members of this ancient family of lipoprotein receptors are also subject to extensive alternative splicing of as yet unknown biological significance. A common ligand for all members of the gene family is apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a polymorphic gene strongly associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Some members of the family serve primarily as transporters for cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins. Others, such as the very low density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr) and the ApoE receptor-2 (Apoer2, also known as Lrp8), function in a partly overlapping manner during brain development, where they control the ordered formation of cortical layers (Trommsdorff et al., 1999Trommsdorff M.

Both Apoer2 and Vldlr serve as receptors for Reelin (D’Arcangelo et al., 1999D’Arcangelo G. Homayouni R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T.

Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for the propagation of the Reelin signal within the migrating cell (Howell et al., 2000Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A.

Reelin is also a highly conserved molecule that is present in all vertebrates studied to date (Tissir and Goffinet, 2003Tissir F. Goffinet A.M. Reelin and brain development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 496-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). With the end of the neuronal migration period, Reelin expression by Cajal-Retzius neurons subsides and is replaced by expression from a subset of GABAergic interneurons interspersed throughout the neocortex and hippocampus (Alcantara et al., 1998Alcantara S. Ruiz M. D’Arcangelo G. Ezan F. de Lecea L. Curran T. Sotelo C. Soriano E. Regional and cellular patterns of reelin mRNA expression in the forebrain of the developing and adult mouse.J.

On an evolutionary time scale, the LDL receptor gene family made its first appearance in primitive multicellular organisms such as C. elegans, and its structural organization has remained essentially unchanged. With the appearance of the mammalian kingdom, a new exon that is not present in birds was added to the cytoplasmic domain of Apoer2 (Brandes et al., 1997Brandes C. Novak S. Stockinger W. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Avian and murine LR8B and human apolipoprotein E receptor 2: differentially spliced products from corresponding genes.Genomics. 1997; 42: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This exon is differentially spliced in the brain, and the stretch of amino acids encoded by this exon was found to interact with scaffolding proteins that function in trans-synaptic and intracellular signaling. Taken together, these observations argue for a distinct function for Reelin in the adult brain that is different from its role in regulating neuronal migration during development. We have recently reported a potent physiological function for Reelin and ApoE receptors in modulating long-term potentiation and learning (Weeber et al., 2002Weeber E.J. Beffert U. Jones C. Christian J.M. Forster E. Sweatt J.D. Herz J. Reelin and ApoE receptors cooperate to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39944-39952Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), demonstrating a novel and larger role for this signaling pathway in the regulation of neurotransmission. Since alternative splicing frequently occurs in proteins involved in neurotransmission, we wanted to explore the role of the alternatively spliced intracellular domain (ICD) of Apoer2 in transmitting the Reelin signal in the adult brain. In this study, we used a knockin approach in mice to demonstrate that Reelin-mediated enhancement of long-term potentiation depends upon the presence of the 59 amino acids that are encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19 (ex19). This exon is also necessary for the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptor (NR2) subunits in hippocampal slices in response to Reelin. The splicing is regulated in an activity-dependent manner, and mice expressing mutant Apoer2 receptors lacking ex19 are severely deficient in learning and memory, processes for which NMDA receptors are essential. Apoer2 and Dab1 are present in the postsynaptic density where Apoer2 resides in a complex with NMDA receptors. These findings establish a molecular mechanism by which Reelin, in conjunction with regulated alternative splicing of ApoE receptors, regulates synaptic function, learning, and memory in the adult brain. The intracellular domain (ICD) of Apoer2 interacts with several cytosolic adaptor and scaffolding proteins, which include Dab1 (Trommsdorff et al., 1999Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T.

In order to explore the physiological significance of this alternative splicing event, we have used a knockin approach to generate two strains of mice that constitutively lack or express the 59 amino acid insert that is encoded by this exon. A replacement-type knockin vector was designed as shown in Figure 1A to direct expression from a cDNA cassette that was inserted by homologous recombination into the Apoer2 locus. A schematic that shows both forms of the ICD that either constitutively express the alternatively spliced exon 19 (ex19) or lack it completely (Δex19) is shown in Figure 1B. Mice generated from targeted ES cells were bred to homozygosity and verified by Southern blotting and PCR (Figures 1C and 1D). To remove the neomycin (neo) resistance cassette used for ES cell targeting, the mutant animals were also crossed with a deleter strain of mice that express Cre recombinase in their germline. All mice used for subsequent analyses lacked the neo cassette. To verify that all mutant alleles were expressed at normal levels in vivo, neuronal membrane extracts from the indicated mouse strains (Figure 1E) were immunoblotted with three antibodies directed against different epitopes in Apoer2. All receptor forms were detected by antibodies directed either against the extracellular domain (αED) or the carboxyl terminus (αCT). αEX19 is directed against an epitope within exon 19, which is absent in the Δex19 mutant. Apoer2 is critical for normal neuronal positioning in the neocortex and in the hippocampus and, together with the Vldlr, for the development of the cerebellum (Trommsdorff et al., 1999Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Reeler/Disabled-like disruption of neuronal migration in knockout mice lacking the VLDL receptor and ApoE receptor 2.Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of the absence or presence of the alternatively spliced ICD insert encoded by exon 19, we examined sagittal H&E sections from 3-week-old (P21) mice expressing either of the two ICD forms (Figure 2A ). Wild-type (panel a) and Apoer2 (Apoer2−/−) knockout mice (panel b) served as controls. As reported earlier (Trommsdorff et al., 1999Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Reeler/Disabled-like disruption of neuronal migration in knockout mice lacking the VLDL receptor and ApoE receptor 2.Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar), Apoer2 knockouts have marked neuronal positioning defects throughout the CA1–CA3 regions and the dentate (DG). By contrast, the hippocampus of mice constitutively expressing (ex19, panel c) or lacking exon 19 (Δex19 panel d) were indistinguishable from the wild-type. The lamination of the neocortex and the foliation and Purkinje cell positioning in the cerebellum were also unaffected (data not shown). Thus, absence of the ICD insert alone does not affect neuronal positioning in the mammalian brain. Reelin binding to Apoer2 and Vldlr activates a kinase cascade that involves Src family members, PI3 kinase, and the serine/threonine kinases Akt and Gsk3 (Arnaud et al., 2003Arnaud L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38772-38779Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We assessed the ability of Reelin to stimulate Dab1 and Akt phosphorylation in cultured embryonic forebrain neurons from each of the Apoer2 ICD mutants as described previously (Beffert et al., 2002Beffert U. Morfini G. Bock H.H. Reyna H. Brady S.T. Herz J. Reelin-mediated signaling locally regulates protein kinase B/Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49958-49964Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We performed this assay in the absence of functional Vldlr, since either Apoer2 or Vldlr alone are sufficient to induce Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro (Beffert et al., 2002Beffert U. Morfini G. Bock H.H. Reyna H. Brady S.T. Herz J. Reelin-mediated signaling locally regulates protein kinase B/Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49958-49964Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), although both receptors are necessary for normal neuronal migration in vivo (Trommsdorff et al., 1999Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Reeler/Disabled-like disruption of neuronal migration in knockout mice lacking the VLDL receptor and ApoE receptor 2.Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2B, phosphorylation of Dab1 and Akt in neurons was dependent upon Reelin (lanes 1 and 2) and did not occur in neurons lacking both receptors (lanes 3 and 4). The presence (lanes 5 and 6) or absence (lanes 7 and 8) of exon 19 did not affect the ability of Reelin to induce Dab1 or Akt phosphorylation, indicating that the insert encoded by exon 19 is not required for the initial activation and intracellular propagation of the Reelin signal. We thus decided to explore whether it might be required for the coupling of the signal to other compartments of the neuronal signal transmission machinery, such as ion conduction channels in the synapse. We have shown earlier that Apoer2 is involved in hippocampal LTP in area CA1, but is not involved in the mechanisms underlying basal synaptic transmission (Weeber et al., 2002Weeber E.J. Beffert U. Jones C. Christian J.M. Forster E. Sweatt J.D. Herz J. Reelin and ApoE receptors cooperate to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39944-39952Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). To further explore the role of Apoer2 signaling in the adult hippocampus, we probed the well-defined Schaffer collateral synapses for altered synaptic function and synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from our ICD mutants. As shown in Figure 2A, neuronal positioning and anatomy of the hippocampus are unaltered in these mice and indistinguishable from wild-type. Overall synaptic transmission was determined from the population excitatory postsynaptic potentials (pEPSPs) of field recordings from hippocampal area CA1 synapses and evaluated by determining the amplitude of the evoked fiber volley versus the slope of pEPSP at increasing stimulus intensities (Figure 3A ). Linear regression analysis revealed no significant difference in the first differential for any of the mutant animals (Apoer2 [ex19], slope = 2.99 ± 0.24; Apoer2 [Δex19], slope = 2.02 ± 0.29). This suggests that the overall connectivity across Schaffer collateral synapses is unaltered in both mutants. Short-term plasticity was evaluated using paired-pulse facilitation and revealed no significant differences in either of the animal groups compared to each other or compared to wild-type control mice, with the exception of the 50 ms interpulse interval, which was marginally reduced in the Apoer2 (Δex19) mice (Figure 3B). Thus, we cannot rule out a minor contribution of Apoer2 to presynaptic functions. Because LTP is impaired in Apoer2-deficient mice, we decided to investigate the role of the ICD on Apoer2- and NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity. We had previously established that a theta burst stimulation (TBS) protocol most prominently revealed the LTP deficit in Apoer2-deficient mice (Weeber et al., 2002Weeber E.J. Beffert U. Jones C. Christian J.M. Forster E. Sweatt J.D. Herz J. Reelin and ApoE receptors cooperate to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39944-39952Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The degree of potentiation produced with this protocol was similar in all groups (Figure 3C). Thus, no significant differences of synaptic transmission, paired-pulse facilitation, and TBS-induced LTP were seen between wild-type and Apoer2 (ex19) and Apoer2 (Δex19) mice. We have reported earlier that Reelin increased LTP induction in wild-type hippocampus slices. In addition, this increase in potentiation was dependent upon the presence of Apoer2 (Weeber et al., 2002Weeber E.J. Beffert U. Jones C. Christian J.M. Forster E. Sweatt J.D. Herz J. Reelin and ApoE receptors cooperate to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39944-39952Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine the response of LTP to Reelin in our Apoer2 ICD mutants. In response to Reelin, Apoer2 (ex19) mice showed a robust increase in LTP induction (Figure 3D), which was completely abrogated in the neuroanatomically indistinguishable Apoer2 (Δex19) mutant (Figure 3E). To test whether the enhancement of LTP by Reelin is due, at least in part, to the modulation of NMDA receptors, we determined the effect of Reelin on NMDA receptor potentials in hippocampal slices for each animal group (Figure 3F). We found that Reelin potentiates NMDA receptor-mediated pEPSPs recorded in area CA1 when AMPA receptors are blocked with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). Wild-type and Apoer2 (ex19) mice showed a similarly significant increase in NMDA receptor potentials upon Reelin perfusion, which was maintained longer in the Apoer2 (ex19) mutants. By contrast, the Apoer2 (Δex19) mutant showed no elevation of NMDA receptor-dependent potentials above baseline synaptic responses (F[2,300] = 71.2, p < 0.0001, ANOVA). Reelin had no effect on AMPA receptor-mediated field potentials (see the Supplemental Data available online). To verify that the increased NMDAR function seen during our field recording was the direct effect of Reelin acting on postsynaptic neurons, we applied Reelin to synaptically evoked whole-cell NMDAR-mediated EPSCs (NMDA-EPSC) in wt CA1 neurons (voltage clamped at +30 mV) in the presence of the GABAA receptor blocker picrotoxin (100 μM) and CNQX (10 μM). Reelin increased NMDA-EPSC in seven of eight CA1 pyramidal cells tested (Figures 4A 1 and 4B); the increase was seen within 10 min from the start of Reelin application and lasted up to 1 hr. The parallel column fractions from untransfected HEK293 culture medium (Mock) showed no effect on NMDA-EPSC. We further asked whether the Reelin effect was specific to NMDARs by examining isolated AMPAR responses to Reelin. In the presence of 100 μM picrotoxin and 100 μM D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid (AP-5 or APV), AMPA-EPSC was not changed by a 20 min application of Reelin (Figures 4A2 and 4C). Taken together, these data indicate that LTP enhancement by Reelin involves a molecular mechanism that is dependent upon the alternatively spliced exon 19. In addition, this mechanism involves, at least in part, the modulation of NMDA receptor functions. Apoer2 is also necessary for normal associative learning using a fear conditioning test (Weeber et al., 2002Weeber E.J. Beffert U. Jones C. Christian J.M. Forster E. Sweatt J.D. Herz J. Reelin and ApoE receptors cooperate to enhance hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39944-39952Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). To better define the role of the alternatively spliced cytoplasmic insert in this learning paradigm, we assessed associative learning ability in wild-type and Apoer2 ICD mutants. We first performed two-trial fear conditioning by pairing an aversive stimulus (US; mild foot shock) with an acoustic component (CS; white noise) in a novel context. Fear response was assessed by the frequency at which normal motor behavior was disrupted by “freezing.” The degree of freezing to the tone and shock during training was not significantly different between animal groups (data not shown). Figures 5A and 5B show the extent of short-term (1 hr, black bars) and long-term (24 hr, white bars) associative learning to the (acoustic) cue and the (environmental) context. The extent of learning was evaluated by the amount of freezing behavior of the animal. Although both contextual and cued fear-conditioned learning are dependent on proper function of the amygdala, only the contextual component of fear-conditioned learning is hippocampus dependent. The cue test did not reveal any significant difference between the animal groups, although the Apoer2 (Δex19) mice showed a trend toward reduced freezing (Figure 5A). When compared to wild-type mice, the Apoer2 (ex19) mutants (n = 11) showed comparable freezing to the reintroduction to the context (Figure 5B) at both 1 hr and 24 hr after training (p > 0.5, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test). By contrast, the Apoer2 (Δex19) (n = 11) mutant showed a highly significant reduction in freezing following the reintroduction to the context compared to wild-type mice (n = 19) (1 hr and 24 hr; F[4, 45] = 11.19, p < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA) as well as compared to the Apoer2 (ex19) mutant (p < 0.01, q = 4.5) at the 1 hr (p < 0.05) and 24 hr contextual test times (p < 0.01). We also performed open-field, rotorod, prepulse inhibition, and hot plate tests to ensure that the observed deficits were not due to a pre-existing physical or behavioral deficit and found no significant differences in any of the animal groups compared to wild-type or to each other (data not shown). These observations indicate that both Apoer2 ICD mutants show overall normal activity, perception, motor coordination, and nocicept"

Although nitrogen and phosphorus colimitation hindered phytoplankton growth, phosphorous may have been transferred through the microbial food web to copepods via two, not mutually exclusive, pathways: (i) bypass of the phytoplankton compartment by phosphorus uptake in heterotrophic bacteria and (ii) tunnelling, whereby phosphate luxury consumption rapidly shifts the stoichiometric composition of copepod prey.

The anterior cingulate (ACC) is critically involved in demanding cognitive tasks and is most reliably activated with increasing task difficulty (Paus et al., 1998Paus T. Koski L. Caramanos Z.

Event-related potential studies have localized an ACC component called the error-related negativity (ERN) (Gehring et al., 1993Gehring W.J. Goss B. Coles M.G.H. Meyer D.E. Donchin E. A neural system for error detection and compensation.Psychol. Sci. 1993; 4: 385-390Crossref Scopus (2021) Google Scholar), as it is typically more negative after participants make incorrect responses, compared to correct choices. A prevailing hypothesis holds that the ERN reflects ACC activity caused by dips in dopamine (DA) following incorrect responses (Holroyd and Coles, 2002Holroyd C.B. Coles M.G.H. The neural basis of human error processing: Reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2002; 109: 679-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar), which is supported by evidence of these dips from animal experiments (Schultz, 2002Schultz W.

Derryberry D. Reed M. Poulsen C. Electrophysiological responses to errors and feedback in the process of action regulation.Psychol. Sci. 2003; 14: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, the fundamental computational nature of the ERN and its implications for behavior are still a matter of intense debate. In particular, a major competing account suggests that the ERN is an index of response or decision conflict, of which errors are simply a special case (Yeung et al., 2004Yeung N. Botvinick M.M. Cohen J.D. The neural basis of error detection: conflict monitoring and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2004; 111: 931-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Each of these ERN theories (error processing and conflict monitoring) accounts for some data that the other does not, suggesting that an integrative approach is in order (Botvinick et al., 2004Botvinick M.M. Cohen J.D. Carter C.S. Conflict monitoring and anterior cingulate cortex: an update.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 539-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar). Here we show that the relative size of the ERN predicts the degree to which participants learn more about the negative, as compared to positive, consequences of their decisions. Further, while ERN magnitude was not associated with overall response conflict, an effect of conflict was revealed that depended on the participants learning bias. Positive learners had larger ERNs when faced with high-conflict win/win decisions among two good options than during lose/lose decisions among two bad options, whereas negative learners showed the opposite pattern. Thus, we show that the ERN is not only an error detection mechanism, but that its relative magnitude actually predicts the degree to which participants learn from errors and that its indexing of conflict depends on the type of decision faced by the particular learner. We employed a modified version of a reinforcement learning paradigm previously shown to be sensitive to dopaminergic manipulation (Frank et al., 2004Frank M.J. Seeberger L.C. OReilly R.C. By carrot or by stick: Cognitive reinforcement learning in Parkinsonism.Science. 2004; 306: 1940-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar; M.J.F. and R.C. OReilly, unpublished data). Three different stimulus pairs (AB, CD, EF) are presented in random order, and participants have to learn to choose one of the two stimuli (Figure 1A ). Feedback follows the choice to indicate whether it was correct or incorrect, but this feedback is probabilistic. A choice of stimulus A leads to visual positive feedback in 80% of AB trials, whereas a B choice leads to negative feedback in these trials (and vice versa for the remaining 20% of trials). CD and EF pairs are less reliable: stimulus C is correct in 70% of CD trials, while E is correct in 60% of EF trials. Over the course of training, participants learn to choose stimuli A, C, and E more often than B, D, or F. Note that learning to choose A over B could be accomplished either by learning that A leads to positive feedback or that B leads to negative feedback (or both). To evaluate whether participants learned more about positive or negative outcomes of their decisions, we subsequently tested them with all novel combinations of training stimuli (e.g., AC, BD, etc.). If participants learned more from positive feedback, they should reliably choose stimulus A in all novel test pairs in which it is present. On the other hand, if they learned more from negative feedback, they should more reliably avoid stimulus B. Differences in positive/negative feedback learning in this task were previously found to depend on different levels of dopamine in the basal ganglia (Frank et al., 2004Frank M.J. Seeberger L.C. OReilly R.C. By carrot or by stick: Cognitive reinforcement learning in Parkinsonism.Science. 2004; 306: 1940-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar; M.J.F. and R.C. OReilly, unpublished data), as predicted by our computational model (Frank, 2005Frank M.J. Dynamic dopamine modulation in the basal ganglia: A neurocomputational account of cognitive deficits in medicated and non-medicated Parkinsonism.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2005; 17: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). By our model’s account, dopamine dips during negative feedback support NoGo learning to avoid selecting the same response in the future. Following this same logic, we predicted that the ERN, which is thought to arise from these same dopamine dips (Holroyd and Coles, 2002Holroyd C.B. Coles M.G.H. The neural basis of human error processing: Reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2002; 109: 679-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar), would be large for participants who tended to learn more from the negative consequences of their decisions. On the other hand, if the conflict monitoring hypothesis is correct, we expected that larger ERNs would be observed during novel test pairs that involved selecting between two stimuli with similar reinforcement histories (e.g., 80% against 70%), relative to pairs that should elicit less conflict (e.g., 80% against 30%). As expected, the base-to-peak ERN magnitude following erroneous test responses was larger than that of the CRN following correct choices (−3.04 μV compared with −2.29 μV, t[48] = 4.4, p < 0.0001, Figure 2). Notably, the ERN magnitude was predictive of the degree to which participants learned more from the negative than positive consequences of their decisions. That is, more negative ERNs were correlated with a propensity to avoid the most negative stimulus B in novel test pairs (r = −0.46, p < 0.001; Figure 3A ) and with a bias to more reliably avoid B than to choose the most positive stimulus A (r = −0.35, p = 0.01). In contrast, the CRN magnitude was not predictive of either positive (r = −0.19, n.s.) or negative (r = −0.2, n.s.) learning. Finally, relatively larger ERN than CRN magnitudes were correlated with better negative than positive learning (r = −0.35, p = 0.01; Figure 3B).Figure 3ERP Correlates of Learning and ConflictShow full caption(A and B) Across all participants, better overall negative reinforcement learning was associated with larger ERN magnitudes, and preferential biases to learn more from negative than positive feedback were associated with relatively more negative ERNs than CRNs.

(C and D) Error versus conflict effects on ERN magnitude. There was a large main effect of error, but not conflict. ERNs were somewhat larger on low-conflict error trials, in which participants would be more likely to detect that they had made an error. To determine whether these correlational effects were robust, we categorized participants as either positive or negative reinforcement learners. Positive learners (n = 24) were selected as those participants who performed better at choosing A than avoiding B in novel test pairs, whereas negative learners (n = 25) were selected based on better performance at avoiding B (Figure 1A). Group comparisons revealed that positive learners were better than negative learners at choosing A (F[1,47] = 7.4, p = 0.009), while negative learners were better than positive learners at avoiding B (F[1,47] = 20.0, p < 0.0001; Figure 1B). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results were consistent with the correlational results described above. Specifically, negative learners had significantly larger ERN amplitudes than positive learners (F[1,47] = 6.8, p = 0.01; Figure 2), with no group differences in CRN magnitude (F[1,47] = 0.2). Moreover, negative learners showed a greater differentiation between ERN and CRN magnitudes than did positive learners (F[1,47] = 9.5, p= 0.0035). These learning biases and associated ERP correlates were found despite no overall test accuracy difference between groups, either in the tendency to choose A over B in the AB pair (F[1,47] = 1.0, n.s.) or in overall performance among novel test pairs (F[1,47] = 0.85). That negative learners had larger ERNs suggests that these individuals are more affected by, and therefore learn more from, their errors. This notion makes the strong prediction that the feedback negativity should also be relatively larger in these participants to negative compared with positive feedback, which could potentially reflect the neural mechanism causing them to be more sensitive to their mistakes. To test this idea, we recorded feedback-locked ERPs during training. Indeed, while groups did not differ in their FRN magnitudes to either negative feedback (F[1,47] = 0.02) or positive feedback (F[1,47] = 2.4, n.s.), negative learners had relatively larger FRNs to negative compared with positive feedback than did positive learners (F[1,47] = 3.93, p = 0.05; Figures 2E and 2F). In the feedback-locked ERP, there was also a late positive P300 component that was larger for negative than positive feedback (t[48] = 6.6, p < 0.0001). However, unlike the FRN, relative P300 magnitude to negative feedback was not greater in negative than positive learners (F[1,47] = 0.0). Thus, this P300 may relate to conscious awareness that an error has occurred but is not predictive of learning from these errors. This is consistent with reports that the P300 responds greater to negatively affective stimuli than to positive stimuli (Ito et al., 1998Ito T. Larsen J.T. Smith N.K. Cacioppo J.T. Negative information weighs more heavily on the brain: the negativity bias in evaluative categorizations.J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1998; 75: 887-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar) and may reflect disappointment after having made an incorrect choice (Yeung and Sanfey, 2004Yeung N. Sanfey A.G. Independent coding of reward magnitude and valence in the human brain.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6258-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ERN and FRN reflect common neural processes within the ACC (Miltner et al., 1997Miltner W.H. Baum C.H. Coles M.G.

The neural basis of human error processing: Reinforcement learning, dopamine, and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2002; 109: 679-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (2778) Google Scholar). Finally, we were also interested in evaluating the role of response conflict on ERN magnitude. According to the conflict monitoring hypothesis, rather than detecting errors per se, the ACC (and by extension, the ERN) is sensitive to the coactivation of mutually incompatible responses (Yeung et al., 2004Yeung N. Botvinick M.M. Cohen J.D. The neural basis of error detection: conflict monitoring and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2004; 111: 931-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). By this account, the ERN is observed after errors as participants tend to internally correct their erroneous choice by activating the response they should have made, and this conflicts with the incorrect response already activated. Note that when selecting among two stimuli that have similar reinforcement histories, participants should have more difficulty making choices and should be more likely to activate both competing responses. Thus, the conflict monitoring hypothesis predicts that the ERN should be larger in these trials in which multiple responses compete for the control of action (Yeung et al., 2004Yeung N. Botvinick M.M. Cohen J.D. The neural basis of error detection: conflict monitoring and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2004; 111: 931-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we divided novel test pairs into low- and high-conflict decisions. Low-conflict decisions were defined as test trials that required choosing an overall positive stimulus (A, C, or E) over an overall negative stimulus (B, D, or F), whereas high-conflict decisions required choosing among two stimuli that have similar overall associations (both positive or both negative). To determine whether there were differential contributions of conflict versus error in the ERN magnitude, we performed a 2 × 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA on group, conflict (low, high), and error (correct, incorrect). There was a highly significant main effect of error (F[1,47] = 22.2, p < 0.0001, Figures 3C and 3D), which interacted with the positive/negative learning group (F[1,47] = 9.5, p = 0.0035), again showing bigger ERNs in negative learners. Notably, there was no main effect of conflict (F[1,47] = 2.5, p > 0.1), no interaction with learning group (F[1,47] = 0.4), and no error by conflict interaction (F[1,47] = 0.5). [The nonsignificant trend for a conflict effect was actually in the reverse direction, with low-conflict decisions eliciting numerically larger ERNs than high-conflict decisions. Strictly speaking, Yeung et al., 2004Yeung N. Botvinick M.M. Cohen J.D. The neural basis of error detection: conflict monitoring and the error-related negativity.Psychol. Rev. 2004; 111: 931-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar argue that the high-conflict effect should be observed prior to the response in correct trials (when conflict is resolved). However, we did not observe a consistent negativity prior to the response, despite using preresponse baseline corrections that should have enabled these to be observed if they existed. We also found no effect of conflict on the stimulus-locked N2.] Nevertheless, we reasoned that the lack of conflict effect across all participants could be explained by the possibility that distinct sorts of decisions would evoke conflict in positive and negative learners. To test this idea, we further divided high-conflict decisions into win/win decisions (choosing among two positive stimuli) and lose/lose decisions (two negative stimuli). We hypothesized that both during and following win/win decisions, positive learners would be more likely to activate the alternative choice for which they had also developed a positive association. In contrast, negative learners should be more likely to activate both responses during lose/lose decisions as they attempt to avoid both negative stimuli. Thus, the conflict hypothesis predicts that positive learners should have larger ERNs during win/win than lose/lose decisions, whereas negative learners should show the opposite pattern. Indeed, while positive and negative learners did not differ in ERN magnitudes to overall high-conflict decisions (F[1,47] = 1.94, n.s.), there was a significant interaction between positive/negative group and win/win versus lose/lose decision type (F[1,47] = 7.6, p = 0.008; Figure 4). That is, ERNs were larger in positive learners during win/win compared with lose/lose decisions (t[23] = −2.3, p = 0.03), while the opposite pattern was observed in negative learners (t[24] = 1.53, p = 0.14), a trend that was significant in just error trials (t[24] = 2.6, p = 0.016). In other words, positive reinforcement learners appear to have experienced greater conflict when choosing between two stimuli that were each previously associated with positive (compared with negative) feedback, whereas negative reinforcement learners may have experienced greater conflict when choosing among negative stimuli. Taken together, our findings provide valuable constraints toward advancing theoretical perspectives on the role of the ERN in reinforcement learning and decision making. First, our results are consistent with a large literature pointing to a role for the ERN in error detection (Falkenstein et al., 1991Falkenstein M. Hohnsbein J. Hoormann J. Blanke L.

Segalowitz S.J. The effects of uncertainty in error monitoring on associated ERPs.Brain Cogn. 2004; 56: 215-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) but go beyond these studies to demonstrate that the ERN also reflects error correction. Previous attempts to link the ERN with error correction failed to show a relationship with the behavioral slowing that is typically observed following errors (Gehring and Fencsik, 2001Gehring W.J. Fencsik D.E. Functions of the medial frontal cortex in the processing of conflict and errors.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9430-9437PubMed Google Scholar, Hacjak et al., 2004Hacjak G. McDonald N. Simons R.F. Error-related psychophysiology and negative affect.Brain Cogn. 2004; 56: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We find that, rather than having an effect on response speed, larger ERNs were associated with a bias to learn to avoid negative events more than to seek positive events. Second, because negative learners also had relatively larger FRNs following negative feedback, our results suggest that the FRN may index a trait or state variable associated with whether participants are more responsive to positive or negative reinforcement and provide corroboratory evidence for the hypothesis that the FRN and ERN reflect common neural processes (Luu et al., 2003Luu P.

Neurosci. 2005; 21: 3161-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Third, our findings shed light on competing theories of error and conflict monitoring within the ACC. While there was no overall conflict effect on ERN magnitude, positive and negative learners may have experienced differential conflict depending on whether they were making win/win or lose/lose decisions. Finally, our results provide insight into the consistent observation that both ERNs and harm avoidance are enhanced in participants with negative affect, anxiety, and depression (Luu et al., 2000Luu P. Collins P. Tucker D.M. Mood, personality, and self-monitoring negative affect and emotionality in relation to frontal lobe mechanisms of error monitoring.J. Exp. Psychol.

Despite not manipulating or measuring dopamine (DA) function directly, our findings also lend support to the general notion that ERNs are related to DA dips that occur during error processing (Holroyd and Coles, 2002Holroyd C.B.

Specifically, our computational model of the basal ganglia suggests that dips in DA enable NoGo learning to avoid maladaptive decisions, whereas DA bursts support Go learning from positive decision outcomes (Frank, 2005Frank M.J. Dynamic dopamine modulation in the basal ganglia: A neurocomputational account of cognitive deficits in medicated and non-medicated Parkinsonism.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2005; 17: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). We recently confirmed a central prediction of this model by showing that Parkinson’s patients, who have low levels of DA, learned more from negative than positive reinforcement (Frank et al., 2004Frank M.J. Seeberger L.C. OReilly R.C. By carrot or by stick: Cognitive reinforcement learning in Parkinsonism.Science. 2004; 306: 1940-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Further, dopaminergic medication reversed this bias, improving positive but impairing negative reinforcement learning, consistent with the notion that medication increases DA levels and blocks the effects of DA dips that would normally support NoGo learning (Frank, 2005Frank M.J. Dynamic dopamine modulation in the basal ganglia: A neurocomputational account of cognitive deficits in medicated and non-medicated Parkinsonism.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2005; 17: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). We also observed this same crossover interaction on positive/negative learning in young, healthy participants taking low doses of two opposing DA medications (M.J.F. and R.C. OReilly, unpublished data). Moreover, in light of this model, our findings also reconcile conflicting ERN results previously found in Parkinson’s patients (Holroyd et al., 2002Holroyd C.B. Praamstra P. Plat E. Coles M.G. Spared error-related potentials in mild to moderate Parkinsons disease.Neuropsychologia. 2002; 40: 2116-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, Falkenstein et al., 2001Falkenstein M.

Specifically, the model predicts that, due to low DA levels and intact NoGo learning, patients should have spared ERNs. However, DA medication should block these DA dips during errors and should therefore reduce the ERN. Indeed, spared ERNs were found in one study with nonmedicated patients (Holroyd et al., 2002Holroyd C.B. Praamstra P. Plat E. Coles M.G.

We delivered vaporized odorants via the orthonasal and retronasal routes and measured brain response with fMRI. Comparison of retronasal versus orthonasal delivery produced preferential activity in the mouth area at the base of the central sulcus, possibly reflecting olfactory referral to the mouth, associated with retronasal olfaction. Routes of delivery produced differential activation in the insula/operculum, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex in orthonasal > retronasal and in the perigenual cingulate and medial orbitofrontal cortex in retronasal > orthonasal in response to chocolate, but not lavender, butanol, or farnesol, so that an interaction of route and odorant may be inferred. These findings demonstrate differential neural recruitment depending upon the route of odorant administration and suggest that its effect is influenced by whether an odorant represents a food."

We have previously reported that male mice with a null mutation in the V1a receptor (V1aR) exhibit a profound impairment in social recognition and changes in anxiety-like behavior. Using site-specific injections of a V1aR-specific antagonist, we demonstrate that the lateral septum, but not the medial amygdala, is critical for social recognition. Reexpressing V1aR in the lateral septum of V1aR knockout mice (V1aRKO) using a viral vector resulted in a complete rescue of social recognition. Furthermore, overexpression of the V1aR in the lateral septum of wild-type (wt) mice resulted in a potentiation of social recognition behavior and a mild increase in anxiety-related behavior. These results demonstrate that the V1aR in the lateral septum plays a critical role in the neural processing of social stimuli required for complex social behavior."

A select group of photosynthetic microorganisms, including the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has evolved the additional ability to redirect the derived H+ and e- to drive hydrogen (H2) production via the chloroplast hydrogenases HydA1 and A2 (H2 ase). This process occurs under anaerobic conditions and provides a biological basis for solar-driven H2 production. However, its relatively poor yield is a major limitation for the economic viability of this process. To improve H2 production in Chlamydomonas, we have developed a new approach to increase H+ and e- supply to the hydrogenases. In a first step, mutants blocked in the state 1 transition were selected. These mutants are inhibited in cyclic e- transfer around photosystem I, eliminating possible competition for e- with H2ase. Selected strains were further screened for increased H2 production rates, leading to the isolation of Stm6. This strain has a modified respiratory metabolism, providing it with two additional important properties as follows: large starch reserves (i.e. enhanced substrate availability), and a low dissolved O2 concentration (40% of the wild type (WT)), resulting in reduced inhibition of H2ase activation. The H2 production rates of Stm6 were 5-13 times that of the control WT strain over a range of conditions (light intensity, culture time, ± uncoupler). Typically, ∼540 ml of H2 liter-1 culture (up to 98% pure) were produced over a 10-14-day period at a maximal rate of 4 ml h-1 (efficiency = ∼5 times the WT).

The development of new systems to produce zero CO2 emission fuels for the future is one of the greatest challenges facing our society. There are two main reasons for this. First, global oil supplies are rapidly being depleted, and production levels are increasingly being reported to be close to their peak (1Rifkin J. The Hydrogen Economy. Penguin Putnam Inc., New York2002: 64-91Google Scholar, 2Deffeyes K.S. Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ2001: 5-200Google Scholar). Second, zero CO2 emission fuels are becoming increasingly important due to the constraints of global climate change, which is being exacerbated by anthropogenic CO2 emissions (3Petit J.R. Jouzel J.

In this context, hydrogen is currently considered to be among the most promising clean replacement fuels for the future by a number of countries, including the United States (6Abraham S. National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap. United States Department of Energy, Washington, D.

Koizumi (2002) Policy Speech by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to the 154th Session of the Diet. www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/koizumispeech/2002/02/04sisei_e.html. Advances in fuel cell technology and the fact that the combustion of H2 produces only H2O increase the attractiveness of this fuel. Yet, despite the many positive aspects of a future hydrogen economy, its viability is completely dependent upon the development of efficient large scale sustainable H2 production systems. A select group of photosynthetic organisms have evolved the ability to harness the huge solar energy resource to drive H2 fuel production from H2O (9Melis A. Zhang L. Forestier M. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 10Ghirardi M.L. Zhang L. Lee J.W. Flynn T. Seibert M. Greenbaum E. Melis A.

Normally, the photosynthetic light reactions and the Calvin cycle produce carbohydrates that fuel mitochondrial respiration and cell growth. However, under anaerobic conditions, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is largely inhibited. Under these conditions, some organisms (e.g. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) reroute the energy stored in carbohydrates to a chloroplast hydrogenase (H2ase), likely using a NAD(P)H-PQ e- transfer mechanism (11Melis A. Happe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 740-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), to facilitate ATP production via photophosphorylation (Fig. 1b). Thus, H2ase essentially acts as a H+/e- release valve by recombining H+ (from the medium) and e- (from reduced ferredoxin) to produce H2 gas that is excreted from the cell (11Melis A. Happe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 740-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). C. reinhardtii and potentially other green algae could therefore provide the basis for solar driven bio-hydrogen production. The combustion of the evolved H2 yields only H2O and thereby completes the clean energy cycle. The hydrogenases were originally divided into three groups: the nickel-iron, the iron, and the metal-free types. However, recent data have shown that some “metal-free” hydrogenases from methanogenic Archaea actually contain a non-heme iron and CO (12Lyon E.J. Shima S. Buurman G. Chowdhuri S. Batschauer A. Steinbach K. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), suggesting that a more complex situation might exist in nature. To date, two chloroplast H2ases (HydA1 and HydA2) have been identified in C. reinhardtii (13Forestier M. King P. Zhang L. Posewitz M. Schwarzer S. Happe T. Ghirardi M. Seibert M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2750-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Both HydA1 and HydA2 are members of the [Fe]-H2ase class. They are monomeric in structure and have highly conserved amino acid regions containing the four cysteines (hydrogen cluster) involved in the coordination of the active center. In addition, the active center is located within a hydrophobic environment (14Peters J.W. Lanzilotta W.N. Lemon B.J. Seefeldt L.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Peters J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Apart from the hydrogen cluster, they lack any additional [Fe-S] or cysteines. Despite their relatively simple structures, these hydrogenases, which are found in green algae, have a high specific activity (∼1000 units/mg protein-1) (16Happe T. Naber J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Florin L. Tsokoglou A. Happe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6125-6132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This activity is 100-fold higher than that of other H2ases (18Adams M.W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 115-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), highlighting the potential of C. reinhardtii H2ases for the development of solar-powered hydrogen production systems. Despite the high activities of HydA1 and HydA2, both are easily inhibited by O2 (13Forestier M. King P. Zhang L. Posewitz M. Schwarzer S. Happe T. Ghirardi M. Seibert M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2750-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In fact, this inhibition was not overcome until 2000 when Melis and co-workers (9Melis A. Zhang L. Forestier M. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 10Ghirardi M.L. Zhang L. Lee J.W. Flynn T. Seibert M. Greenbaum E. Melis A. Trends Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 506-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) finally showed that the cyclical depletion and repletion of liquid C. reinhardtii cultures with sulfur, facilitated H2 production from water, (+sulfur stage, PSII actively producing H+, e-, and O2, H2ases inactive; -sulfur stage, PSII inhibited, H2ases actively recombine H+ and e- to produce H2). Previous time-resolved analyses of photosynthetic protein patterns upon sulfur depletion showed a precipitous decline in the amount of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase, a more gradual decline in the level of PSII and PSI proteins, and a change in the composition of the PSII light-harvesting complex (LHC-II) (19Zhang L.P. Happe T. Melis A. Planta. 2002; 214: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). PSII inactivation results from the susceptibility of the D1 reaction center protein to photo-damage (20Barber J. Andersson B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 61-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) and its inability to be repaired under sulfur deprivation. Consequently, under -sulfur conditions, the PSII-mediated water-splitting reaction and the associated O2 evolution are inhibited. This in turn releases the oxygen inhibition of H2ase (11Melis A. Happe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 740-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the development of the +sulfur/-sulfur system, H2 production is limited to ∼50% of its maximum capacity. This is because the H2ase activity is inhibited during the aerobic phase. Ideally, a commercial H2 production system would be based upon a continuous process in which PSII and H2ases function simultaneously to drive H2 production from water. With this aim in mind, one approach that has been pursued (with limited success to date) is the engineering of an O2-insensitive H2ase. However, O2 inhibition can be considered to be a valuable attribute as it blocks continued H2 production in the event of an accidental release of the genetically modified photosynthetic organism into an aerobic environment. Consequently, we have favored an alternative strategy; the systematic screening for mutants with an increased H+ and e- supply to H2ase under anaerobic conditions. Mutants blocked in the state 1 transition were therefore selected. Normally, the state transition process regulates the light activation of PSI and PSII, by adjusting their respective light harvesting antenna sizes (21Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 22Bonaventura C. Myers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 366-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In state 1, the antenna of PSII is larger than that of PSI. In state 2 the PSII antenna size is reduced, with mobile LHC-II proteins migrating to PSI. In this way the antenna sizes of the two photosystems are adjusted, by shuttling LHC-II proteins between them (23Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In C. reinhardtii, state transitions have a valuable property in terms of photobiological H2 production. This is because cyclic e- transport is inhibited in state 1, whereas it accounts for most of the overall photosynthetic e- flow in state 2 (24Finazzi G. Rappaport F. Furia A. Fleischmann M. Rochaix J.D. Zito F. Forti G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the WT Chlamydomonas, anaerobiosis induces state 2, the activation of cyclic e- transport and therewith an additional e- sink with which H2ase must compete. This is likely to restrict the H2 production capacity of the WT in sulfur-depleted anaerobic cultures (Fig. 1b). One solution to this problem would be to identify mutants of C. reinhardtii that are locked in state 1 under anaerobiosis. This approach could offer a route to eliminate the competition for PSI-derived e-, between H2ase and cyclic electron transport, resulting in an increased rate of e- supply to the H2ase. Here we describe the development and phenotype of the state 1 blocked C. reinhardtii mutant Stm6. We also highlight the potential of this mutant as a basis upon which to develop future solar-powered H2 production systems. Generation and Identification of Stm6—Stm6 (25Schönfeld C. Wobbe L.

Essentially, nuclear C. reinhardtii insertion mutants with modified state transition/hydrogen production properties were produced by transforming the arg- strain (CC1618) with the plasmid pARG7.8 (26Kruse O. Nixon P.J. Schmid G.H. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 43-51Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Debuchy R. Purton S. Rochaix J.D.

Phycol. 1995; 30: 141-148Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). pARG7.8 contains a 7.8-kb genomic DNA fragment of the C. reinhardtii argino-succinate lyase gene. Arg+ mutants were selected on arg- plates (26Kruse O. Nixon P.J. Schmid G.H. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 43-51Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The arg+ mutant library was then screened for state transition mutants (Stm), which were in turn screened for their ability to produce increased levels of H2 using mass spectrometry. The phenotypic properties of Stm6 were shown, through the detailed genetic characterization and rescue of a fully complemented stain, to be the result of knocking out the moc1 gene (GenBank™ accession number AF531421) transcription (7Hankamer B. Kruse O. U. S. Patent WO2005003024. 2005; (January 13)Google Scholar). Moc1 is a novel nuclear encoded factor that is involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the light (25Schönfeld C. Wobbe L. Borgstädt R. Kienast A. Nixon P.J. Kruse O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50366-50374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Algal Culture—WT (CC1618) and Stm6 cell cultures were grown in the dark or under illumination (40-100 μmol/m2 s-1 white light) on TAP (Tris (20 mm), acetate/phosphate, pH 7.0) agar plates or in TAP medium to a cell density of ∼4 × 105 cells ml-1 (31Harris E. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar). Fluorescence Screening—C. reinhardtii colonies on TAP agar plates were monitored using fluorescence video imaging (Fig. 2a) to identify mutants blocked in state 1. Cells were pre-adapted to state 1 by illuminating with far red light (30 min, 710 nm, 10 μmol m-2 s-1). Subsequently their ability to switch to state 2 min, was monitored in blue light (20 480 nm, 20 μmol m-2 s-1) as reported previously (26Kruse O. Nixon P.J. Schmid G.H. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 43-51Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the ability to perform state transitions was monitored by measuring changes in the fluorescence yield upon a transition from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment (23Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 32Wollman F.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3623-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 33Depege N. Bellafiore S. Rochaix J.-D. Science. 2003; 299: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Under anaerobic conditions, the plastoquinone pool is reduced by using cellular reducing power (34Bulte L. Gans P. Rebeille F. Wollman F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 72-80Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 35Posewitz M.C. Smolinski S.L. Kanakagiri S. Melis A. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2151-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and activation of the kinase responsible for LHC-II phosphorylation can occur in the dark (reviewed in Ref. 32Wollman F.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3623-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy—Cyclic e- transport rates (Fig. 2b) were determined spectroscopically using a home-built spectrophotometer, described previously (24Finazzi G. Rappaport F. Furia A. Fleischmann M. Rochaix J.D. Zito F. Forti G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The light-induced redox changes of cytochrome (Cyt) f were calculated as the difference between the absorption at 554 nm and a base line drawn between 545 and 573 nm (24Finazzi G. Rappaport F. Furia A. Fleischmann M. Rochaix J.D. Zito F. Forti G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Continuous light was produced by a diode laser (SDL-LDI 3225, Wavelength Electronics) providing a 500-milliwatt emission peak at 690 nm. The light source was passed through a neutral density filters to deliver ∼500 μmol m-2 s-1. State 1 was obtained through dark incubation of the cells under aerobic conditions induced by strong agitation of the culture, whereas state 2 was induced through anaerobiosis (23Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 20 μm dichlorophenyl dimethyl urea (DCMU) or 5 μm 2,5-dibromo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBMIB) was added to the solution. DCMU inhibits e- transport from PSII to Cyt b6 f, whereas DBMIB blocks e- transport from plastoquinone to Cyt b6 f. Active PSI and PSII complexes were quantified spectroscopically using charge separation measurements, induced by single turnover flash excitation (Fig. 4). PSI and PSII charge separation was measured as a function of the electrochromic signal at 515-545 nm, after excitation with a saturating laser pulse (5 ns, 6 mJ at 695 nm). The PSII contribution was calculated based on the difference between the signal measured in the absence and in the presence of the PSII inhibitor DCMU. Hydroxylamine (1 mm) was added to inactivate the manganese cluster, thereby slowing down recombination between the donor and acceptor side of PSII. This increased the accuracy of the calculated PSI/PSII ratio (36Finazzi G. Chasen C. Wollman F.A. de Vitry C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed either in cells that were dark-adapted for 2 h (PSII-D) or illuminated for 10 min with 200 μmol m-2 s-1 white light (PSII-L). RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA was isolated from C. reinhardtii cultures using a Promega™ SV RNA isolation kit. Total RNA concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer. First strand cDNA was synthesized using 2.5 μg of total RNA in a reaction volume of 20 μl using the SuperScript III ™ RT (Invitrogen) protocol. A combination of oligo(dT) (0.2 μl of 100 μm) and random hexamers (0.05 μl of 3 μg/μl) primers were used. Following synthesis, cDNA was diluted to 0.25 ml (10 ng/μl). RT-Quantitative-PCR Conditions and Analysis—Primers were designed using the Primer Express 1.5 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Actin forward primer (FP), ACGGCCAGATGATCACCATC; reverse primer (RP), AGTTGAAGGTGGTGTCGTGGAT. hydA1 (FP), AGGCTGACCGCGACTGGT; (RP), GCGCTCCTTGAAGATGTTGC. HydA2 (FP), TGGACGAGCGCAACACG; (RP) CACGTAGTGGGTGTGCAGCA. Analysis was carried out in optical 96-well plates using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector system. Each reaction contained 12.5 μl of SYBR® Green 2× Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 20 ng of cDNA, and 280 nm of each gene-specific primer pair to a final volume of 25 μl. PCR cycling conditions consisted of an initial polymerase activation step at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 59 °C for 1 min, and a final melt step of 60-95 °C over 20 min. Dissociation profiles of the PCR products were analyzed with Dissociation Curves software by ABI. Real time DNA amplification was monitored and analyzed using the Sequence Detector 1.9.1 program (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gene expression levels relative to the housekeeping gene actin (D50838) were calculated for each cDNA sample using the equation: relative ratiogene/actin = (Egene(-Ctgene))/(Eactin-2(-Ctactin-2)). To ensure that samples are taken to the appropriate time points, the oxygen levels in the cultures were measured with a D130 data logger system using SZ10T DO electrodes (Consort, Belgium). Hydrogen Evolution Measurements—For short term hydrogen production measured by gas mass spectrometry, 3 ml of WT and Stm6 cell cultures (OD750 ∼0.8) were dark-adapted for 30 min in a weak vacuum to deplete the medium and head space of O2 and H2 using a home-built vessel, which was directly connected to a Delta Finnigan MAT gas mass spectrometer. H2 evolution was induced by illuminating samples either with pulsed white light (Fig. 2C, 3.3 Hz frequency, 12 flashes of 5 μs; 2000 μmol m-2 s-1) or with continuous white light over a range of light intensities (Fig. 3a, 1 min, 15-3000 μmol m-2 s-1). To measure H2 production in the presence of the uncoupler CCCP, WT and Stm6 samples were supplemented with 5 μm CCCP and subsequently illuminated with continuous white light (Fig. 3b, 5 min, 150 μmol m-2 s-1). Long Term H2 Production Measured by Gas Chromatography—To conduct comparative studies with WT and Stm6 cultures, both strains were grown in sulfur-replete TAP medium to a density of OD750 1.0.(Chl concentration =∼13 μg/ml). To improve further the H2 production rate of the mutant Stm6, cultures were grown to a higher density (OD750 1.1, Chl concentration =∼26 μg/ml). The cells were then subjected to five centrifugation (3000 × g, 5 min, 20 °C)/wash (sulfur-free TAP medium) cycles to ensure the thorough removal of sulfur and efficient induction of the anaerobic H2 production phase. Under continuous white light 100 μmol H2 m-2 s-1was produced for up to 14 days (Fig. 3c). The evolved gas was collected in a custom-built collecting/measurement system and injected (gas-tight lockable Hamilton syringe, SampleLock) at regular intervals into an Agilent Micro GC3000 gas chromatograph. This was fitted with a PlotU pre-column (3 m × 0.32 mm) and MolSieve 5APlot column (10 m × 0.32 mm). Argon (32.5 p.s.i.) was used as the carrier gas. Hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen concentrations were monitored simultaneously. Electron Microscopy—For transmission electron microscopy, cells were grown in TAP medium to a mid logarithmic growth phase (OD750 nm = 0.55) and prepared as described (37Engels A. Kahmann U. Ruppel H.G. Pistorius E.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1340: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Identification of Stm6 as a State Transitions Mutant Locked in State 1—A strategy was developed to isolate random insertion mutants with an improved H2 production capacity under low dissolved O2 concentrations. First, C. reinhardtii insertion mutants were screened for a disrupted state transition process (26Kruse O. Nixon P.J. Schmid G.H. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 43-51Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This process balances the relative activities of PSI and PSII by regulating the size of their light harvesting antennae (Fig. 1, LHC-I and LHC-II, respectively). State transitions can be easily monitored by measuring the amplitude of fluorescence emission under conditions promoting either state 1 or state 2. The fluorescence emission at room temperature is inversely proportional to the yield of PSII photochemistry and proportional to the size of its light harvesting antenna (38Butler W.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1978; 29: 345-378Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the large decrease of PSII antenna size, resulting from the transition from state 1 to state 2, leads to a large decrease in fluorescence (26Kruse O. Nixon P.J. Schmid G.H. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 43-51Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Indeed, such a decrease was observed in wild type cells, upon illumination with the 480 nm light (preferentially absorbed by PSII, see Fig. 2a) or adaptation to anaerobiosis (not shown). In contrast no such decrease was seen in Stm6. This indicates that Stm6 is locked in state1. This conclusion was subsequently confirmed by 77 K fluorescence spectroscopy, which showed that (PSII) blue light illumination (480 nm) was able to increase PSI fluorescence levels at 720 nm in the wild type but not in the mutant (for details see Ref. 25Schönfeld C. Wobbe L. Borgstädt R. Kienast A. Nixon P.J. Kruse O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50366-50374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cyclic Electron Flow Is Down-regulated in Stm6—Previous studies in wild type C. reinhardtii have shown that the state transition process (state 1 to state 2) is coupled with the onset of cyclic electron flow around PSI. Thus cyclic electron flow is active in state 2 and inhibited in state 1 (24Finazzi G. Rappaport F. Furia A. Fleischmann M. Rochaix J.D. Zito F. Forti G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This is clearly supported by the finding that the mutant Stt7, which is blocked in state 1, is unable to undergo cyclic e- transport (24Finazzi G. Rappaport F. Furia A. Fleischmann M. Rochaix J.D. Zito F. Forti G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, the second screening step was designed to identify state 1 mutants (e.g. Stm6) that were unable to perform cyclic electron transport around PSI. As Fig. 1b shows, switching off cyclic e- transport (state 1) may potentially lift the competition for e- between the PQ pool and H2ase, thereby improving the rate of H2 production. Cyclic e- flow can be assayed by measuring the rate of Cyt f reduction under continuous illumination, because this complex is implicated in both (linear and cyclic) modes of electron transport. Under linear flow Cyt b6 f is reduced by PSII (via photo-generation of reduced plastoquinol (PQ)) and oxidized by PSI (via oxidized plastocyanin). In contrast, under cyclic flow, Cyt b6 f is oxidized and re-reduced by PSI alone. To determine the ratio between linear and cyclic flow, the reduction of Cyt b6 f can be measured in the presence (-DCMU) and absence (+DCMU) of PSII activity. Fig. 2b shows the results of this experiment for WT and Stm6. In this experiment, state transitions were induced by incubating the cells either in aerobiosis (state 1) or in anaerobiosis (state 2). Both strains exhibited similar behavior under state 1 conditions. Switching the actinic light on resulted in the oxidation of Cyt f (Fig. 2b, squares), which rapidly reached a plateau level. After the light was switched off, Cyt f reduction was observed, and the absorption signal returned to its initial value. The oxidation yield was increased by the addition of the PSII inhibitor DCMU (Fig. 2b, circles) (39Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) or DBMIB (Fig. 2b, triangles), which inhibits the reduction of cytochrome f via PQ (reviewed in Ref. 40Frank K. Trebst A.

https://openalex.org/W2055305451,"The human visual system can distinguish variations in image contrast over a much larger range than measurements of the static relationship between contrast and response in visual cortex would suggest. This discrepancy may be explained if adaptation serves to recenter contrast response functions around the ambient contrast, yet experiments on humans have yet to report such an effect. By using event-related fMRI and a data-driven analysis approach, we found that contrast response functions in V1, V2, and V3 shift to approximately center on the adapting contrast. Furthermore, we discovered that, unlike earlier areas, human V4 (hV4) responds positively to contrast changes, whether increments or decrements, suggesting that hV4 does not faithfully represent contrast, but instead responds to salient changes. These findings suggest that the visual system discounts slow uninformative changes in contrast with adaptation, yet remains exquisitely sensitive to changes that may signal important events in the environment.

Our visual system is sensitive to many orders of stimulus strength, seemingly capable of distinguishing mountains in the mist as effortlessly as the stripes on a zebra. This ability is all the more amazing given that neurons in the visual pathways are only sensitive to a small range of stimulus strengths. In the cortical visual system, image contrast is the visual property most associated with stimulus strength. Indeed, increasing stimulus contrast makes things more visible, and both single-unit recordings (Albrecht and Hamilton, 1982Albrecht D.G. Hamilton D.B.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3215-3230PubMed Google Scholar) find monotonically increasing activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) with increases in stimulus contrast. However, neurons in V1 do not respond proportionally to all ranges of contrast; they display a sigmoidally shaped contrast response curve (Albrecht and Hamilton, 1982Albrecht D.G. Hamilton D.B. Striate cortex of monkey and cat: contrast response function.J. Neurophysiol. 1982; 48: 217-237PubMed Google Scholar), which is most sensitive to contrast differences in the midrange of the curve and much less sensitive to contrasts above or below this range. Adaptation mechanisms have been proposed as a possible explanation of how the visual system overall can be sensitive to such a wide range of image contrasts while the individual neurons have only a limited dynamic range. Prolonged exposure to a stimulus results in a wide range of visual adaptation effects (e.g., Blakemore and Campbell, 1969Blakemore C. Campbell F.W. On the existence of neurones in the human visual system selectively sensitive to the orientation and size of retinal images.J. Physiol. 1969; 203: 237-260PubMed Google Scholar). These types of perceptual adaptations are paralleled by decreases in firing rates of neurons in V1 (Dean, 1983Dean A.F.

If these decreases in neuronal response were generalized to all contrast levels, a response gain decrease, they would be expected to have a detrimental effect on vision, simply reducing sensitivity to all contrasts.

This finding, a contrast gain change, reflects a more beneficial process for vision in that it serves to recenter contrast response curves around the time-averaged contrast level, allowing these neurons to encode contrasts that are relevant to the scene being viewed. Despite these provocative findings in anesthetized animals, it is not known if these changes occur in the human visual system, let alone whether they represent a general mechanism across visual areas. Imaging studies provide conflicting reports on whether contrast adaptation can be detected in human visual cortex (Engel and Furmanski, 2001Engel S.A. Furmanski C.S. Selective adaptation to color contrast in human primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3949-3954PubMed Google Scholar) or not (Kastner et al., 2004Kastner S. O’Connor D.H. Fukui M.M. Fehd H.M. Herwig U. Pinsk M.A. Functional imaging of the human lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); also, how contrast response functions change with adaptation has not yet been investigated. Beyond V1, only one study (Kohn and Movshon, 2003Kohn A. Movshon J.A. Neuronal adaptation to visual motion in area MT of the macaque.Neuron. 2003; 39: 681-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) has examined how contrast response functions change with adaptation in monkey MT. Despite this lack of physiological evidence in humans, psychophysical measurements of contrast discrimination thresholds have been found to change with adaptation in a way that is consistent with contrast gain and not response gain changes (Greenlee and Heitger, 1988Greenlee M.W. Heitger F. The functional role of contrast adaptation.Vision Res. 1988; 28: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). By imaging early visual cortex in awake humans, using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, we have established that in V1, V2, and V3, there are profound contrast gain changes that are consistent with psychophysics and confer a beneficial effect on human vision. We also found a basic difference between the response to contrast changes of human V4 (hV4) and earlier visual cortex, which has not been reported in either monkey electrophysiology or fMRI experiments; hV4 responded positively to contrast changes regardless of the sign of the change. This result signals a fundamental shift in visual processing between hV4 and earlier visual cortical areas. While slowly changing or static contrast levels are unlikely to signal biologically relevant events, changes in contrast, regardless of whether they are increases or decreases, may signal important events to which our visual system should be sensitive. Contrast adaptation is a process by which neurons adjust to slowly changing or static contrast levels, thus reducing our sensitivity to these uninformative features of the visual world. The response property of hV4 that we found is the expected signature of a process that counterbalances slow adaptation to static contrast by being sensitive to the salience of dynamic changes. We measured blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast response functions for three different levels of adaptation contrast (6.25%, 12.5%, and 25%), using an event-related stimulus paradigm (Figure 1). After an initial 30 s baseline phase, we presented the adaptation stimulus to the subject for 60 s. During the whole experiment, we instructed the subject to perform a detection task on the fixation cross, to keep fixation centered and to provide a control for attentional state. We tested contrast response by incrementing or decrementing the contrast by 1 or 2 octaves (an octave being a doubling) for 3 s. Contrast was the only aspect of the stimulus that we changed during these periods. After each test contrast, we readapted the subject with the adaptation contrast for 8–12s. This stimulus paradigm, adapted from electrophysiological experiments (Ohzawa et al., 1982Ohzawa I. Sclar G. Freeman R.D. Contrast gain control in the cat visual cortex.Nature. 1982; 298: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), was used because both the readaptation (or top-up) contrasts and the balancing of contrast increments and decrements serve to keep the time-averaged contrast during the experiment at the adaptation level. Examination of the time course from a representative voxel taken from one subject’s retinotopically mapped V1 shows the BOLD response to the various events in our experiment (Figure 2A ). During the baseline phase, the time course is flat, with some fluctuations. Soon after we turn on the adaptation stimulus (yellow arrow), the time course displays a rapid rise followed by a slower decay. We interpret this decay as a signature of neural adaptation and analyze it in detail in Figure 6. Following this initial adaptation period, the time course exhibits transient peaks following the times that we increased the contrast by 1 or 2 octaves (green and magenta arrows, respectively). Following the times when we decrease the stimulus contrast by 1 or 2 octaves (purple and cyan arrows, respectively), there are transient dips. To use these transient peaks and dips following contrast increments and decrements as a measure of the contrast response, we first estimated the average response to each contrast, using a deconvolution procedure (Figure 2B). This procedure, without assuming a shape for the hemodynamic response, takes a stimulus-triggered average and assumes that any overlap in responses results in linear combination (Boynton et al., 1996Boynton G.M. Engel S.A. Glover G.H. Heeger D.J. Linear systems analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging in human V1.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4207-4221PubMed Google Scholar, Dale and Buckner, 1997Dale A.M. Buckner R.L. Selective averaging of rapidly presented individual trials using fMRI.Hum. Brain Mapp. 1997; 5: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). After an ∼3 s delay following increments in stimulus contrast, these hemodynamic responses exhibited a large positive peak followed by a longer lasting negative undershoot, classic features of the hemodynamic response (Kruger et al., 1996Kruger G. Kleinschmidt A. Frahm J. Dynamic MRI sensitized to cerebral blood oxygenation and flow during sustained activation of human visual cortex.Magn. Reson. Med. 1996; 35: 797-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These hemodynamic responses were scaled by the test contrast, displaying a larger response for 2 octaves than for 1 octave (magenta and green curves, respectively). Conversely, hemodynamic responses to transient decrements in contrast displayed a transient decrease in the BOLD response that also scaled with the magnitude of contrast change (purple and cyan curves). We developed a procedure to determine the significance of event-related activations on a voxel-by-voxel basis without recourse to the more usual practice of averaging together the response of voxels in a region of interest (ROI) defined by activations from another experiment. We first calculated the amount of variance in the raw time course that was accounted for by the hemodynamic responses such as the ones shown in Figure 2B. This value, r2, is equal to 0 if stimulus-locked events in the time course do not account for any of the variance, and r2 = 1 if these events account for all of the variance. The distribution of r2 for all voxels in a volume for one experiment (Figure 3A inset, green bars, mostly obscured by blue bars), shows a broad distribution of values with a mean of 0.09, reflecting the fact that the majority of voxels in the volume are not being activated by our stimulus and therefore have low r2 values. To determine which of these r2 values were higher than can be expected by chance, and were therefore significantly activated by our stimulus, we randomly shuffled stimulus times and recomputed a distribution of r2 values (blue bars). An expansion of the tail of the real and randomized distributions (Figure 3A) reveals that the distribution of real r2 values contains values much higher than those predicted by chance in the randomized distribution. Maps of r2 values (Figure 3, bottom right) with a cutoff chosen on the basis of the randomized distribution (red arrowhead, Figure 3A) to produce a false alarm probability of p = 0.001 validate this measure of activation in two ways: (1) Voxels that have r2 values higher than those expected by chance were clustered in parts of the early visual cortex where they were expected to be based on retinotopy; and (2) the hemodynamic response functions of these voxels were all of the classic form (Figures 3B–3D). At a cutoff of p = 0.001, the image in Figure 3 (cropped to 48 × 48 voxels) is expected to have 2.3 voxels falsely classified as activated and has two obvious false positives located outside the brain; (the full image [64 × 64 voxels] is expected to have 4.1 false positives and has six). Using this voxel-by-voxel measure of significance, we constructed contrast response functions from the hemodynamic responses of significantly activated voxels (p < 0.001). We first calculated the response to the adaptation contrast as the difference between the mean level during the experiment after the adaptation period and the mean level during the baseline period. The rationale for this measure was that for the majority of time during the experiment, the adaptation contrast was presented, and the test stimuli were balanced for contrast increments and decrements, thus making the time-average contrast the same as the adaptation contrast (see below for discussion on possible sources of error). We then fit gamma functions to each of the hemodynamic responses (Figure 2B) and used the peak of this function as the response to each of the test contrasts. These points were then plotted above and below the response to the adaptation contrast. We discarded voxels with a response amplitude higher than 5%, as these were likely due to signals from large draining veins, and voxels in which the amplitude of the gamma fit was not adequately constrained by the data (variance of the amplitude parameter estimate >50%). We plotted contrast response functions in this way for each of the three adaptation contrasts (6.25%, 12.5%, and 25% contrast; cyan, red, and black curves, respectively; Figures 4A–4C , top row). Each function shows the mean and SEM of the contrast response function constructed from all significantly activated voxels (p < 0.001) taken from eight experiments conducted in five different subjects (two subjects were tested multiple times). The number of voxels used to construct the curves for 6.25%, 12.5%, and 25% adaptation for V1 was 51, 74, and 77, respectively. For V2 there were 34, 46, and 39 voxels, and for V3 there were 11, 15, and 22. Examination of these curves reveals that the primary effect of adaptation is to shift the contrast response curves horizontally to the right with higher adaptation contrasts. This trend can be seen for curves generated for V1 (Figure 4A), as well as for V2 and V3 (Figures 4B and 4C). We next used a voxel-by-voxel analysis to quantitatively examine the shifts in contrast response functions. For this analysis, we fit a sigmoidal function (Albrecht and Hamilton, 1982Albrecht D.G. Hamilton D.B. Striate cortex of monkey and cat: contrast response function.J. Neurophysiol. 1982; 48: 217-237PubMed Google Scholar, Naka and Rushton, 1966Naka K.I. Rushton W.A. S-potentials from colour units in the retina of fish (Cyprinidae).J. Physiol. 1966; 185: 536-555PubMed Google Scholar) to contrast response functions constructed separately for each activated voxel at each adaptation level. In this analysis, we required that a voxel be activated at p < 0.001 for all adaptation contrasts tested (which were three contrasts, except for two of the eight experiments, in which we collected only the data for 6.25% and 12.5% adaptation contrasts for one and only the 12.5% adaptation contrast for the other). We adjusted three parameters in the fit; the center (c50), the amplitude (Rmax), and the offset. These curves fit our data satisfactorily, accounting for 93% of the variance, on average. The distributions of the c50 parameter for different adaptation levels in V1 (Figure 4A, second row,) show a systematic shift toward higher values with higher adaptation contrasts. In fact, the means of the distributions closely track the adaptation contrasts for which they were obtained, indicating that the center of the contrast response curves shifts near the adaptation contrast. The distribution of Rmax (Figure 4A, third row) shows a trend for larger amplitude contrast response functions with higher adaptation levels, but this effect did not generally reach statistical significance (see below). There were no systematic differences in the distribution of offsets (bottom row) for different adaptation levels. The effects of adaptation on these three parameters of the sigmoidal fits to the contrast response functions were qualitatively similar for all three visual areas. To test the statistical significance of the qualitative results reported above, we used a nested ANOVA in which we tested the difference across adaptation conditions among the data for each voxel nested inside groups collected on different days from different subjects. This analysis confirmed the difference across adaptation conditions of the c50 parameter for V1–V3 (p < 0.001) and found no significant difference in means for the offset and Rmax parameters (all p > 0.7), except for a difference in Rmax for V2 (p = 0.034). Intersubject variations were not significant except for the offset parameter for some areas (p = 0.0034, p = 0.022, p = 0.1, V1, V2, and V3 respectively) and for the c50 parameter only in V3 (p < 0.001, all other p > 0.3). These results confirm that the main difference in contrast response functions across adaptation conditions is a shift in the horizontal location (c50) with differences in the amplitude (Rmax) reaching borderline significance in one case. Furthermore, there was only a modest amount of intersubject variation, primarily for the offset parameter. We next explored the consequences of changing the voxel selection criteria from the fairly restrictive cutoff used in Figure 4 to one that includes all voxels in the ROI defined from retinotopic mapping. We did this by systematically changing the r2 cutoff value for including voxels in the construction of the contrast response functions in V1–V3, using cutoff values of 0.11, 0.10, 0.09, 0.08, 0.05, and 0.0 (Figure 5, in descending order of color saturation). The final cutoff value corresponds to inclusion of all of the voxels defined from the retinotopic ROI—942, 715, and 633 voxels, respectively, for V1, V2, and V3. Contrast response functions in V1 and V2 still maintained horizontal shifts with adaptation even when all voxels in the retinotopic ROI were included. However, as more voxels that were not activated by the stimulus were included in the analysis, the contrast response functions become correspondingly more flat. This effect is most pronounced for area V3, which had the least number of activated voxels, flattening the curves to such an extent that the consequences of adaptation on contrast response were obscured. To quantitatively assess whether the method of selecting voxels for analysis affects our results, we performed a nested ANOVA analysis (similar to that above) on all voxels from V1–V3 defined using the ROI method. The difference in c50 was significant for V1–V3 (p < 0.001), and no other parameters showed significant differences (p = 0.094 for Rmax in V1; all other p ≥ 0.4). Intersubject variations were only significant for the offset parameter for some areas (p < 0.001, p = 0.23, and p = 0.050, V1, V2, and V3, respectively), the c50 parameter, for V3 (p < 0.001), and the Rmax parameter, for V2 (p = 0.017; all other p > 0.5). These results indicate that our primary observation of horizontal shifts of c50 as a consequence of contrast adaptation is largely independent of the voxel selection. In estimating the response to the adaptation contrast, we used the mean during the experiment, which may be subject to two sources of error. First, though the contrast increments and decrements were balanced on a log scale, the neural responses may not be completely balanced, thus contaminating the estimate of the response. Second, our high-pass filter, though set to be quite conservative, could have filtered out differences in adaptation levels. To test whether these factors might substantially change our results, we recalculated the response to the adaptation contrast as the average of the last 15 time points acquired in the last 12 s of the adaptation period from the data before temporal filtering. We expected the response in this epoch to be near the steady-state level, but not to be contaminated by responses to test stimuli. Using the same nested ANOVA approach as above, we confirmed that this analysis produced equivalent results. Differences in the c50 parameter across adaptation conditions were significant (p ≤ 0.015, V1–V3), with the slightly larger p values presumably reflecting the noisier response estimation without filtering. The offsets and Rmax parameters were all nonsignificant across adaptation conditions (p > 0.7) except for the Rmax parameter for V2 (p = 0.033). Employing the full ROI-based method and including all voxels regardless of their r2 value again resulted in significant differences for the c50 parameter for all areas (p ≤ 0.011) and nonsignificance for differences of the offsets and Rmax parameters (p > 0.3) except for the Rmax parameter for V3 (p = 0.024). We next examined the time course over which the BOLD measurements adapted by examining the initial 60 s response when the adaptation stimulus was first turned on (indicated by the yellow arrow, Figure 2A). The average response for voxels in each visual area shows an initial rise as the adaptation stimulus is turned on, followed by a slower decay as the signal adapts. We fit these responses from the time of peak to the end of the adaptation period with a decaying exponential function (solid curves, Figures 6A–6C ). These functions made reasonable fits to the data accounting for 57%–84% of the variance in V1; 50%–70%, in V2; and 24%–63% of the variance in V3. The time constants for the adaptation effect show that this effect has a timescale on the order of tens of seconds, with the median time constants from V1–V3 being 14.42 s (18.03 ± 3.19 s, mean ± SEM). Previous fMRI experiments have used block design experiments to test contrast sensitivity (Avidan et al., 2002Avidan G. Harel M. Hendler T. Ben-Bashat D. Zohary E. Malach R. Contrast sensitivity in human visual areas and its relationship to object recognition.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 3102-3116PubMed Google Scholar, Kastner et al., 2004Kastner S. O’Connor D.H.

Functional analysis of human MT and related visual cortical areas using magnetic resonance imaging.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3215-3230PubMed Google Scholar), in which the response to each contrast is typically measured over many seconds. Block design experiments may therefore be more sensitive to the adapted response near the end of adaptation (red arrow, Figure 6A), rather than the initial response to the contrast before adaptation (black arrow, Figure 6A). We examined the difference in contrast sensitivity that these two measures showed, by plotting the initial peak (Figure 6, right column, black squares) and the adapted response taken as the mean during the experiment (red circles). The range of response was much greater for the preadaptation data than for the postadaptation data. For example, when the stimulus was 6.25% contrast versus 25% contrast, the difference in response for V1 was 1.09% of BOLD response. After adaptation, this difference was only 0.28%. Taking the ratio of these values reveals that the contrast sensitivity was 3.88 times greater before adaptation. Contrast sensitivity measured in this way was 3.10 and 3.37 times greater for V2 and V3, respectively. We found that the responses to contrast decrements in hV4 were fundamentally different from the responses in earlier visual cortex. While earlier visual areas all showed decreases in response when contrast was decremented, voxels in hV4 responded to both contrast decrements and contrast increments with positive responses, a single-voxel example of which is shown in Figure 7A . These responses, averaged over voxels, led to flatter contrast response functions than did those in earlier visual areas (Figu"

Unlike the proliferative action of SPHK1, another isozyme, SPHK2, has been shown to possess anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic action. Molecular mechanisms of SPHK2 action, however, are largely unknown. The present studies were undertaken to characterize the N-terminal-extended form of SPHK2 (SPHK2-L) by comparing it with the originally reported form, SPHK2-S. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that SPHK2-L mRNA is the major form in several human cell lines and tissues. From sequence analyses it was concluded that SPHK2-L is a species-specific isoform that is expressed in human but not in mouse. At the protein level it has been demonstrated by immunoprecipitation studies that SPHK2-L is the major isoform in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. SPHK2-L, when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, did not show any inhibition of DNA synthesis in the presence of serum, whereas it showed marked inhibition in the absence of serum. Moreover, serum deprivation resulted in the translocation of SPHK2-L into the nuclei. In addition, serum deprivation induced SPHK2-L expression in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, suppression of SPHK2 by small interfering RNA treatment prevented serum deprivation- or drug-induced apoptosis in HEK293 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that a major form of SPHK2 splice variant, SPHK2-L, in human cells does not inhibit DNA synthesis under normal conditions and that SPHK2-L accumulation in the nucleus induced by serum deprivation may be involved in the cessation of cell proliferation or apoptosis depending on the cell type.

Interest in S1P has focused recently on two distinct cellular actions of this lipid, namely the function of S1P as an extracellular ligand activating specific G protein-coupled receptors and the role of S1P as an intracellular second messenger (4Meyer zu Heringdorf D. van Koppen C.J. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Noticeably, some of the diverse signaling roles attributed to elevated cellular S1P levels include prevention of ceramide-induced apoptosis (5Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34499-34505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 6Cuvillier O. Pirianov G. Kleuser B. Vanek P.G. Coso O.A. Gutkind S. Spiegel S.

Two isoforms of mammalian SPHK (SPHK1 and SPHK2) have been cloned and characterized (8Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-23728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 9Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

SPHK1 is a cytosolic enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of 49 kDa and contains five conserved domains, the second of which has a conserved ATP binding motif found in diacylglycerol kinases (8Kohama T.

Overexpression of SPHK1 induces cell proliferation by promoting the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle as well as by inhibiting the apoptotic response to serum deprivation or ceramide treatment (10Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). SPHK2 contains the same five conserved domains found in SPHK1 while also having divergent sequences at the N-terminal and in the middle regions, resulting in a protein 200 amino acids larger than SPHK1. In addition, heterogeneity in the N terminus was found in SPHK2 (11Billich A. Bornancin F. Devay P. Mechtcheriakova D. Urtz N. Baumruker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47408-47415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), whose mechanism of generation remains unknown. The role of SPHK2, however, has not been elucidated until recently. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that SPHK2 is a nuclear protein and inhibits DNA synthesis when over-expressed in mammalian cells (12Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Similarly, Liu et al. (13Liu H. Toman R.E. Goparaju S.K. Maceyka M.

More recently, SPHK2 has been postulated to function as a potential immunomodulator either through phosphorylation of an immunosuppressant drug, FTY720 (11Billich A. Bornancin F. Devay P.

However, the physiological role of SPHK2 remains largely unknown.The present studies were undertaken to determine the physiological role of N-terminal-extended SPHK2 (SPHK2-L) in comparison with the originally reported form (SPHK2-S). Here we have shown that SPHK2-L is the predominant form, at least in human cell lines and tissues tested. We have also presented data that SPHK2-L is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in concert with serum.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Cloning and Mammalian Expression Vectors—The human SPHK2-L cDNA (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number NM_020126) was amplified from a human liver cDNA library by PCR using KOD-PLUS polymerase (Toyobo, Tokyo) with 5′-AC AGA TCT AAC AGA GCA GAG GAC CAG CAG-3′ and 5′-AC AGA TCT AAG CTT GTT TAG TTT CAG GGC-3′ sense and antisense primers, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned into pCMV5 to make an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged construct. Construction of human SPHK2-S expression vectors has been described previously (12Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duven, Germany). Total RNAs from various human tissues were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using MuLV reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) priming with random hexamers. Quantitative PCR was performed by applying the real-time SYBR Green PCR technology with the use of an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The human SPHK2-specific primers were designed by using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems), and their sequences were as follows: SPHK2-L mono-specific, 5′-ATG AAT GGA CAC CTT GAA GCA G-3′ and 5′-CAT GGC CTT AGC CCT GAC CAG-3′, located in exon 1 and exon 2, respectively (Fig. 2A, Pair 1); SPHK2-L and SPHK2-S duo-specific, 5′-CTG TCT GCT CCG AGG ACT GC-3′ and 5′-CAA AGG GAT TGA CCA ATA GAA GC-3′, located in exon 2 and exon 3, respectively (Fig. 2A, Pair 2); and for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-GCC ATC AAT GAC CCC TTC ATT-3′ and 5′-TCT CGC TCC TGG AAG ATG G-3′. Amplification reaction was performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 10 s at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, and 31 s at 60 °C. The expression of human SPHK2 (hSPHK2) mRNA was normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression.Immunoprecipitation and SPHK Assay—Preparation of an antibody against hSPHK2 has been described previously (12Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). An antibody against the N terminus of SPHK2-L (anti-SPHK2-L) was generated by immunizing rabbits with an oligopeptide (MNGHLEAEEQQDQRPDQELTGSWGHGPRSTLVRAKA) containing the N-terminal 36 amino acids of SPHK2-L fused with glutathione S-transferase. The antibody was affinity purified by using the immunogen-immobilized Sepharose 4B.HEK293 cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Crude supernatant fractions were prepared as described previously (16Fujita T. Okada T. Hayashi S. Jahangeer S. Miwa N. Nakamura S. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) except that detergent was excluded from the lysis buffer and cells were disrupted by sonication. SPHK2 was immunoprecipitated using anti-SPHK2 or anti-SPHK2-L antibody and assayed for SPHK activity as reported earlier (12Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol.

Subcellular localization studies using confocal microscopy were performed as described previously (17Hayashi S. Okada T. Igarashi N. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNA at a final concentration of 50 nm/slide chamber using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, cells were cultured for another 72 h either with 10 or 0.1% FCS (serum deprived) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 (20 μg/ml) and analyzed for morphological studies.Other Procedures—Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation was measured as described previously (12Igarashi N.

The SPHK2-L gene is ∼10 kb long and consists of 6 exons separated by 5 introns (Fig. 1A). The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA contained 654 residues and a calculated molecular weight of 69,213. SPHK2-S, originally reported by Liu et al. (9Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), lacks the exon 1, and the first initiation codon for translation was within the exon 2 (Fig. 1B). It is reasonable to assume that SPHK2-S is generated by means of alternative splicing from the same gene that encodes SPHK2-L. It should be noted that prior to the initiating codon in mouse exon 2 there is a stop codon (Fig. 1B, double underlined TGA), strongly suggesting that no SPHK2-L exists in mouse.FIGURE 1Structure of SPHK2. A, schematic representation of genomic organization of hSPHK2. Protein coding exons of hSPHK2 gene are given as boxes and introns as a thin horizontal line. Note that a large intron follows exon 1 in SPHK2-L and that exon 2 includes the first initiation codon for SPHK2-S, the previously reported SPHK2 (9Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K.

The nucleotide (upper) and amino acid (lower) numbering is based on the hSPHK2-L sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We quantified the amount of each splice variant in various human cell lines by real-time quantitative PCR using two pairs of primer sets (Fig. 2A). In primer set 1 the forward primer was located within exon 1 and the reverse primer on exon 2 so that the specific mRNA encoding SPHK2-L could be detected, whereas in primer set 2 the forward primer was located within exon 2 and the reverse primer on exon 3, which enabled us to recognize mRNA encoding both SPHK2-L and SPHK2-S. Assuming that the molar ratio of SPHK2-L to SPHK2-S mRNA is 1:1, the ratio of the amount of PCR products obtained with these primer pairs is anticipated to be 1:2. Surprisingly, in various human tissues and cell lines the relative amount of PCR product generated with primer Pair 1 is almost similar to that obtained with the primer Pair 2, indicating that SPHK2-L is the major form expressed in most human tissues and cell lines except brain and kidney (Fig. 2, B and C), where SPHK2-S might be expressed significantly. 3Using a human brain total RNA purchased from a different commercial source (BD Biosciences), the observed proportion between SPHK2-L and total SPHK2 mRNAs was similar to that obtained previously and shown in Fig. 2C, suggesting the possibility of expression of SPHK2-S in these tissues. Using a different pair of primers in which the forward primer was located within exon 5 and the reverse primer on exon 6 so that the mRNA encoding both the SPHK2-L and the SPHK2-S could be detected, almost the same results as with the Pair 2 were obtained (data not shown).Endogenous SPHK2-L Is the Predominant Form in Human Cell Lines—To detect endogenous SPHK2-L, an antibody against SPHK2-L was prepared. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a glutathione S-transferase-fused oligopeptide containing the N-terminal-extended 36 amino acids of SPHK2-L specifically recognized SPHK2-L, but not SPHK2-S, on immunoblots (Fig. 3A). This antibody immunoprecipitated SPHK2 activity from HeLa cell lysates in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B), confirming the existence of SPHK2-L in HeLa cells. Using this antibody, subcellular distribution of endogenous SPHK2-L was studied. SPHK2-L was mainly distributed in the nuclei and to a small extent diffusely in the cytosol of HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). This distribution pattern is similar to that of SPHK2-S and is quite reasonable because SPHK2-L contains the same nuclear localization signal as SPHK2-S (12Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Similarly, in human hepatoma HepG2 cells endogenous SPHK2-L was detected in the nuclei and to a similar extent in the cytosol in a punctate pattern, suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is regulated depending on cell types. To demonstrate further that SPHK2-L is a major form at the protein level endogenous SPHK2 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed. Anti-SPHK2-L antibody immunoprecipitated the enzyme only from human hepatoma HepG2 cells but not from mouse NIH3T3 cells, although anti-SPHK2 antibody, which recognizes both SPHK2-L and SPHK2-S, immunoprecipitated it from both cell lysates (Fig. 4A). Together with results from the sequence analyses (Fig. 1B), these results indicate that SPHK2-L is a species-specific isoform that is present in human but not in mouse, as expected from the results in Fig. 1B.FIGURE 3Detection of endogenous SPHK2-L in various human cell lines.

First, the enzyme was immunoprecipitated from HepG2 cell lysates with anti-SPHK2 antibody and dissociated from the immune complex by incubating with the immunogen peptide. The eluted enzyme was then immunoprecipitated by anti-SPHK2-L antibody. The majority of SPHK activity was immunoprecipitated by the long form-specific antibody with a concomitant loss of the activity from the supernatant in an antibody concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B), suggesting that SPHK2-L is a major form in HepG2 cells. Similar results were obtained when HEK293 cell lysates were used as endogenous enzyme sources (data not shown).Inhibition of DNA Synthesis by SPHK2-L Is Overcome by Serum—We have previously shown that SPHK2 enters nucleus and inhibits DNA synthesis (12Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To determine whether this was true for the SPHK2 variant as well, DNA synthesis was measured in HEK293 cells expressing HA-SPHK2-L or HA-SPHK2-S. As shown in Fig. 5, BrdUrd incorporation was markedly suppressed in cells transiently expressing HA-SPHK2-S compared with green fluorescent protein-expressing control cells, which is consistent with our previous report (12Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In contrast, when HA-SPHK2-L was expressed the inhibition of BrdUrd uptake was minimal in 10% serum-containing medium. Even comparing the cells that expressed the recombinant proteins to a similar extent, SPHK2-L has little or no effect on BrdUrd uptake (not shown), indicating that SPHK2-L does not inhibit DNA synthesis significantly under normal culture conditions (in the presence of 10% serum). We have previously reported that inhibition of DNA synthesis in HeLa cells by SPHK2 is more easily observed when cells are cultured under low (0.1%) serum conditions (12Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To demonstrate this tendency with SPHK2-L, DNA synthesis was measured in HEK293 cells transiently expressing SPHK2-L under low or high serum conditions. Under low serum conditions, BrdUrd incorporation was strongly suppressed in cells expressing SPHK2-L when compared with control (green fluorescent protein expressing) cells (Fig. 5). The serum concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis by SPHK2-L was further demonstrated by cell cycle analysis showing that the population of G2/M cells expressing SPHK2-L was remarkably low in 0.1% but not in 10% serum-containing medium as compared with respective control cells expressing green fluorescent protein (see supplemental materials).FIGURE 5Inhibition of DNA synthesis by SPHK2-L is overcome by serum. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-SPHK2-L, HA-SPHK2-S, or green fluorescent protein plasmid (control) and cultured for 1 day in medium supplemented either with 0.1% (serum -) or 10% FCS (serum +). After adding BrdUrd, double immunofluorescence was used to visualize SPHK-transfected cells and BrdUrd incorporation, and the proportion of SPHK-expressing cells incorporating BrdUrd was determined. Data are means ± S.E. of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SPHK2-L Tends to Enter the Nucleus under Low Serum Conditions—The observation that serum (10%) overcomes the inhibition of DNA synthesis by SPHK2-L prompted us to study the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SPHK2-L by serum. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-SPHK2-L, and its subcellular distribution was analyzed under high or low serum conditions. Under high serum conditions (10% FCS), SPHK2-L tended to be mainly localized in the cytosol with a small amount in the nucleus (Fig. 6, A and C). Under the low serum conditions (0.1% FCS), the population of cells with predominant nuclear localization was increased (Fig. 6, B and C), indicating the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SPHK2-L by serum. This tendency of serum deprivation-induced accumulation of SPHK2-L in the nucleus was confirmed using endogenous enzyme in non-neoplastic human skin fibroblasts (see supplemental materials).FIGURE 6Serum-dependent regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SPHK2-L. A and B, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HA-SPHK2-L and cultured for 1 day with either 10% (A, serum +) or 0.1% (B, serum -) FCS. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained for confocal microscopic analyses using anti-SPHK2-L anti-body. C, from immunocytochemical data obtained in panels A and B, cells expressing SPHK2-L were subdivided into three populations depending on SPHK2-L staining pattern: cells with predominantly nuclear localization (N > C), cells with equal distribution between nucleus and cytosol (n = C), and cells with predominantly cytosolic localization (N < C). Five different fields were analyzed with a minimum of 100 cells. The data presented are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Serum Deprivation Results in Increased SPHK2-L Expression in HEK293 Cells—During the course of studies on the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HA-SPHK2-L by serum in HEK293 cells, we noticed that the amount of endogenous SPHK2 tended to increase under conditions when cells were cultured in low serum medium. This observation prompted us to measure endogenous SPHK2 levels under different serum conditions. HEK293 cells were cultured for 2 days either in a low (0.1%) or high (10%) serum medium and assayed for SPHK2 activity or mRNA levels by real-time quantitative PCR using primer Pair 2 (Fig. 2A), which allows the detection of both SPHK2-S and SPHK2-L mRNAs. Low serum conditions resulted in 1.6- and 5.4-fold increases in SPHK2-specific activity and total SPHK2 mRNA levels, respectively (TABLE ONE). Similar results were obtained when real-time quantitative PCR was conducted using a primer Pair 1 that is specific to SPHK2-L, suggesting that serum deprivation induces mainly SPHK2-L expression but not SPHK2-S. During the 2-day culture of HEK293 cells in low serum medium, however, the cellular content of ceramide and S1P did not change significantly as compared with the cells cultured in high serum medium (see supplemental materials).TABLE ONESerum deprivation-induced SPHK2 expressionSPHK2 activityTotal SPHK2 mRNASPHK2-L mRNApmol/min/106 cells-FoldRelative expression-FoldRelative expression-Fold+ Serum1.33 ± 0.0611.0 ± 0.2211.0 ± 0.061− Serum2.15 ± 0.081.65.4 ± 0.375.45.5 ± 0.335.5 Open table in a new tab Suppression of SPHK2 Expression by siRNA Protects HEK293 Cells from Serum Deprivation- or Drug-induced Apoptosis—To assess the physiological role of SPHK2 we analyzed cellular responses induced by serum starvation in HEK293 cells where the level of endogenous SPHK2 was specifically suppressed by SPHK2-targeted siRNA. Compared with control siRNA, treatment with two different SPHK2-siRNAs suppressed the SPHK2 mRNA level in HEK293 cells (Fig. 7A). HEK293 cells underwent apoptosis after serum deprivation as seen in control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 7, B and C).

https://openalex.org/W2040300306,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), the main water channel in the brain, is expressed in the perivascular membranes of mouse, rat, and human astrocytes. In a previous study, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to specifically knock down AQP4 in rat astrocyte primary cultures and found that together with reduced osmotic permeability, AQP4 knockdown (KD) led to altered cell morphology. However, a recent report on primary cultured astrocytes from AQP4 null mice (KO) showed no morphological differences compared with wild types. In this study, we compared the effect of AQP4 KD in mouse, rat, and human astrocyte primary cultures and found that AQP4 KD in human astrocytes resulted in a morphological phenotype similar to that found in rat. In contrast, AQP4 KD in mouse astrocytes caused only very mild morphological changes. The actin cytoskeleton of untreated astrocytes exhibited strong species-specific differences, with F-actin being organized in cortical bands in mouse and in stress fibers in rat and human astrocytes. Surprisingly, as a consequence of AQP4 KD, F-actin cytoskeleton was depolymerized in rat and human whereas it was completely rearranged in mouse astrocytes. Although AQP4 KD induced alterations of the cell cytoskeleton, we found that the expression of dystrophin (DP71), beta-dystroglycan, and alpha-syntrophin was not altered. AQP4 KD in cultured mouse astrocytes produced strong down-regulation of connexin43 (Cx43) with a concomitant reduction in cell coupling while no major alterations in Cx43 expression were found in rat and human cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that with regard to these properties, human astrocytes in culture are more similar to rat than to mouse astrocytes. Moreover, even though AQP4 KD in mouse astrocytes did not result in a dramatic morphological phenotype, it induced a remarkable rearrangement of F-actin, not related to disruption of the dystrophin complex, indicating a primary role of this water channel in the cytoskeleton changes observed. Finally, the strong down-regulation of Cx43 and cell coupling in AQP4 KD mouse astrocytes indicate that a functional relationship likely exists between water channels and gap junctions in brain astrocytes."

In frog and mouse vestibular hair cells, we found that the rate of fast adaptation depends on both channel opening and stimulus size and that it is modeled well as a release of a mechanical element in series with the transduction apparatus. To determine whether myosin-1c molecules of the adaptation motor are responsible for the release, we introduced the Y61G mutation into the Myo1c locus and generated mice homozygous for this sensitized allele. Measuring transduction and adaptation in the presence of NMB-ADP, an allele-specific inhibitor, we found that the inhibitor not only blocked slow adaptation, as demonstrated previously in transgenic mice, but also inhibited fast adaptation. These results suggest that mechanical activity of myosin-1c is required for fast adaptation in vestibular hair cells.

These results suggest that mechanical activity of myosin-1c is required for fast adaptation in vestibular hair cells. The inner ear enhances detection of low-amplitude sounds by amplifying them. In the mammalian cochlea, outer hair cells boost small signals with the cochlear amplifier (Davis, 1983Davis H. An active process in cochlear mechanics.Hear. Res. 1983; 9: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Although outer hair cells require somatic electromotility for amplification (Liberman et al., 2002Liberman M.C. Gao J. He D.Z. Wu X. Jia S. Zuo J. Prestin is required for electromotility of the outer hair cell and for the cochlear amplifier.Nature. 2002; 419: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), a similar signal enhancement in nonmammalian vertebrates is accomplished by the mechanically sensitive hair bundle (Fettiplace and Ricci, 2003Fettiplace R. Ricci A.J. Adaptation in auditory hair cells.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Bundle mechanisms operate in the mammalian cochlea too; when mechanically stimulated, bundles of outer hair cells exert large forces, which may be coupled to cochlear amplification (Kennedy et al., 2005Kennedy H.J. Crawford A.C. Fettiplace R. Force generation by mammalian hair bundles supports a role in cochlear amplification.Nature. 2005; 433: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The hair bundle performs mechanotransduction in the ear. By stretching elastic gating springs (Corey and Hudspeth, 1983Corey D.P. Hudspeth A.J. Kinetics of the receptor current in bullfrog saccular hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 962-976PubMed Google Scholar), mechanical displacements of the hair bundle rapidly open cation-selective transduction channels; these channels then close on fast (a few milliseconds or less) and slow (tens of milliseconds) time scales (Holt and Corey, 2000Holt J.R. Corey D.P. Two mechanisms for transducer adaptation in vertebrate hair cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 11730-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Slow adaptation occurs when the molecular motor myosin-1c (Myo1c) reduces tension applied to the channels (Holt et al., 2002Holt J.R. Gillespie S.K. Provance D.W. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Corey D.P. Mercer J.A. Gillespie P.G. A chemical-genetic strategy implicates myosin-1c in adaptation by hair cells.Cell. 2002; 108: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). When tension is high, a cluster of Myo1c molecules—the adaptation-motor complex—slips down the actin cytoskeleton, reducing tension; by contrast, when tension is low, the Myo1c molecules climb stereocilia actin filaments to restore tension (Gillespie and Cyr, 2004Gillespie P.G. Cyr J.L. Myosin-1c, the hair cell’s adaptation motor.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 521-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fast adaptation is thought to be the electrical correlate of bundle mechanical amplification (Fettiplace and Ricci, 2003Fettiplace R. Ricci A.J. Adaptation in auditory hair cells.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The prevailing model for fast adaptation suggests that Ca2+, entering through an open transduction channel, binds to or near the channel and causes it to close; this mechanism changes the relationship between gating-spring tension and Po such that channels require more force to open (Howard and Hudspeth, 1988Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Compliance of the hair bundle associated with gating of mechanoelectrical transduction channels in the bullfrog’s saccular hair cell.Neuron. 1988; 1: 189-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Negative mechanical movements of the bundle in response to force stimuli support this channel-reclosure model (Benser et al., 1996Benser M.E. Marquis R.E. Hudspeth A.J. Rapid, active hair bundle movements in hair cells from the bullfrog’s sacculus.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5629-5643PubMed Google Scholar, Ricci et al., 2000Ricci A.J. Crawford A.C. Fettiplace R.

Mechanisms of active hair bundle motion in auditory hair cells.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 44-52PubMed Google Scholar). However, three unexpected results do not support the model: Ca2+ dependence of the swing of the channel’s gate (Martin et al., 2000Martin P. Mehta A.D. Hudspeth A.J. Negative hair-bundle stiffness betrays a mechanism for mechanical amplification by the hair cell.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 12026-12031Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), biphasic mechanical response to transepithelial current pulses (Bozovic and Hudspeth, 2003Bozovic D. Hudspeth A.J. Hair-bundle movements elicited by transepithelial electrical stimulation of hair cells in the sacculus of the bullfrog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and polarity of large bundle forces exerted by outer hair cells during fast adaptation (Kennedy et al., 2005Kennedy H.J. Crawford A.C. Fettiplace R. Force generation by mammalian hair bundles supports a role in cochlear amplification.Nature. 2005; 433: 880-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In an alternative model, a component of the transduction apparatus becomes more compliant or releases (Bozovic and Hudspeth, 2003Bozovic D. Hudspeth A.J. Hair-bundle movements elicited by transepithelial electrical stimulation of hair cells in the sacculus of the bullfrog.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, Martin et al., 2003Martin P. Bozovic D. Choe Y. Hudspeth A.J. Spontaneous oscillation by hair bundles of the bullfrog’s sacculus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4533-4548PubMed Google Scholar); the resulting reduction of tension then allows the channels to close rapidly, also explaining the mechanical results. In this release model, the relationship between tension and Po remains constant. We sought to distinguish between these two models for fast adaptation. We found that, in frog and mouse vestibular hair cells, slow adaptation is proportionally slower for small displacements. In addition, a reciprocal relationship between the extents of fast and slow adaptation suggests that both reduce gating-spring tension. These findings are consistent with the release model but not with the channel-reclosure model. Moreover, Myo1c seems to play an integral role in fast adaptation. First, the rate of fast adaptation is affected by the Myo1c allele expressed in hair cells. Second, NMB-ADP, an allele-specific inhibitor of a mutant Myo1c, rapidly blocks fast adaptation. These results lead us to conclude that fast adaptation depends upon Myo1c activity and likely arises from a rapid conformational change in the motor that relieves tension and allows transduction channels to close in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The two models for fast adaptation predict different rates of slow adaptation for small displacements. Because the adaptation motor behaves viscously (Howard and Hudspeth, 1987Howard J. Hudspeth A.J. Mechanical relaxation of the hair bundle mediates adaptation in mechanoelectrical transduction by the bullfrog’s saccular hair cell.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84: 3064-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, Assad and Corey, 1992Assad J.A. Corey D.P. An active motor model for adaptation by vertebrate hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3291-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of slow adaptation should be proportional to the tension applied to the motor. In the channel-reclosure model for fast adaptation, rapid channel closure shortens the mechanical chain connecting the motor to the gating spring, tensing the spring; therefore, elevated tension should increase the rate of positive adaptation in response to small stimuli (Figure 1B ). Moreover, the distance the motor moves—the extent of slow adaptation—also should increase, because the motor must slip farther down the stereociliary actin filaments to reduce tension to its steady-state level. By contrast, in the release model, fast adaptation lengthens the mechanical chain connected to the gating spring; the resulting reduction in tension should then decrease the rate of slow adaptation (Figure 1C). Fast adaptation thus diminishes the extent of slow adaptation; if the lengthening induced by the release is larger than the stimulus amplitude, no slow adaptation will ensue. In both models, slow adaptation approaches linear viscous behavior with larger-sized stimuli. We tested these models by measuring fast and slow adaptation for a range of mechanical displacements in 15 bullfrog saccule hair cells. We stimulated hair cells with stiff glass probes, which allowed us to avoid the complications of cooperative transduction-channel gating and time-dependent bundle movements. For each cell, we first measured the current-displacement curve, which describes the activation of transduction channels in response to a stimulus. We follow previous convention (Eatock et al., 1987Eatock R.A. Corey D.P. Hudspeth A.J. Adaptation of mechanoelectrical transduction in hair cells of the bullfrog’s sacculus.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2821-2836PubMed Google Scholar) by defining adaptation as the time-dependent shift of the current-displacement curve along the displacement axis, not channel closing per se; for example, for very large bundle displacements, when channels are mostly open, a substantial shift of the current-displacement curve can occur with very little change in open probability. To measure the progress of adaptation, we used the inferred-shift method (Shepherd and Corey, 1994Shepherd G.M.G. Corey D.P. The extent of adaptation in bullfrog saccular hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6217-6229PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, the transduction current at every point during an adapting stimulus is mapped back onto the current-displacement curve to determine Xe(t), the adaptive shift or extent of adaptation. The validity of the method rests on the assumption that, during adaptation, neither the size nor shape of the current-displacement curve changes (Shepherd and Corey, 1994Shepherd G.M.G. Corey D.P. The extent of adaptation in bullfrog saccular hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6217-6229PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to previous results in hair cells of the frog (Shepherd and Corey, 1994Shepherd G.M.G. Corey D.P. The extent of adaptation in bullfrog saccular hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6217-6229PubMed Google Scholar, Cheung and Corey, 2005Cheung, E.L., and Corey, D.P. (2005). Ca2+ changes the force sensitivity of the hair-cell transduction channel. Biophys.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8739-8748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Holt et al., 2002Holt J.R. Gillespie S.K. Provance D.W. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Corey D.P. Mercer J.A. Gillespie P.G.

Time course and extent of mechanotransducer adaptation in mouse utricular hair cells: comparison with frog saccular hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2676-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we found that this assumption holds in our experiments (see Figures S1A and S1B in the Supplemental Data available online). The inferred-shift method is described in detail in Figure S1C. We separated fast and slow adaptation by fitting the Xe(t) data with double-exponential functions (Figure 2B), allowing us to calculate independent fast and slow time constants for each stimulus (see Figure S2 for validation of the fitting routine). The adaptive shift in response to each stimulus size was therefore described by individual values of time constants, τfast and τslow, as well as final amplitudes (adaptation extent) Xe(fast) and Xe(slow). Note that the inferred-shift method gives us the temporal resolution necessary to accurately separate fast and slow adaptation. Fast and slow adaptation were prominent in all cells examined and, as previously noted (Hirono et al., 2004Hirono M. Denis C.S. Richardson G.P. Gillespie P.G. Hair cells require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for mechanical transduction and adaptation.Neuron. 2004; 44: 309-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), their properties were relatively stable over dialysis of 5 min or more. As described previously (Shepherd and Corey, 1994Shepherd G.M.G. Corey D.P. The extent of adaptation in bullfrog saccular hair cells.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6217-6229PubMed Google Scholar), the total extent of adaptation—the shifts of the current-displacement curves on fast and slow time scales in response to an adapting stimulus—was linear between 0 and 0.8 μm (Figure 2D ); the slope of the displacement-extent curve (X′e(total)) was 0.85. By contrast, the extent of fast adaptation saturated. This result is predicted by both models; in the channel-reclosure model, the extent depends on the relative free energies of Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound channels, while in the release model, the extent depends on the length of the release element. Notably, the dependence of fast extent on stimulus size resembled that of the current-displacement curve (Figure 2C). We fit fast-adaptation extent data with a product of Xe(fast)∞, the maximum amplitude of the fast shift, and Po (see Equation S5 in the Supplemental Data); the data were fit well and gave Xe(fast)∞ of 0.29 μm. This value is reported in tip coordinates; conversion to the movement at the level of the adaptation motor requires multiplication by the geometrical gain γ (0.12–0.14 in frog; Jacobs and Hudspeth, 1990Jacobs R.A. Hudspeth A.J. Ultrastructural correlates of mechanoelectrical transduction in hair cells of the bullfrog’s internal ear.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1990; 55: 547-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We interpret the observed dependence on Po as a reflection of fast adaptation’s requirement for Ca2+ entry during transduction (Fettiplace and Ricci, 2003Fettiplace R. Ricci A.J. Adaptation in auditory hair cells.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). At the largest stimulus amplitudes, τfast decreased (Figure 2E). We fit the time constants as a function of displacement with Equation S6 (see the Supplemental Data), assuming that fast adaptation proceeds with two rates: one independent of stimulus size (and hence independent of force) and the other force dependent. Despite the faster rate for large stimuli, the extent of fast adaptation remained the same; this result suggested that the dependence of extent on Po and of τfast on force were different manifestations of a single process that can be triggered by either Ca2+ or force. The decrease in τfast is consistent with the release model, as force could directly cause the conformational shift producing the release, but is inconsistent with the channel-reclosure model, as larger forces in the gating spring would be unlikely to speed channel closing. The distinct behavior of Xe(fast) and τfast produces a displacement dependence for the initial rate of fast adaptation, Xe(fast)/τfast (Figure 2F), that is more complex than that diagrammed in Figure 1. The response of slow adaptation to displacements was markedly different. There was essentially no slow shift of the current-displacement curve (i.e., near-zero extent of slow adaptation) for small Xs, and with larger Xs, the extent of slow adaptation became linear with Xs (Figure 2D). In addition, τslow did not depend on stimulus size (Figure 2E). The upward-curving slow-adaptation rate curve, in which the rate of slow adaptation is near zero for small displacements (Figure 2F, arrow in inset), is consistent with the release model for fast adaptation (Figure 1C). The slow rate was fit by assuming that the adaptation motor was a linearly viscous element that responds to the difference between total and fast extent (Equation S8 in the Supplemental Data). We interpret this relationship as indicating that fast and slow adaptation combine linearly to produce the final extent of adaptation: because a release decreases tension, fast adaptation reduces the force that drives slow adaptation. Equation S8 (Supplemental Data) allowed an excellent fit of the data with a single free parameter, the rate constant for slow adaptation, which was 42 s−1. To determine the generality of these conclusions, we turned to hair cells of the mouse utricle (Figures 2G–2L). Although we initially analyzed data separately from the outbred strain CD-1 and the inbred strain C57BL/6, we found that transduction and adaptation properties were sufficiently similar to pool the two datasets. The rate of fast positive adaptation was significantly lower in mouse than in frog vestibular hair cells (Vollrath and Eatock, 2003Vollrath M.A. Eatock R.A. Time course and extent of mechanotransducer adaptation in mouse utricular hair cells: comparison with frog saccular hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2676-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), both because of intrinsic differences between the two species and because mouse data were acquired at a lower extracellular Ca2+ concentration (1.3 mM, versus 4 mM in frog hair cells). All of the features of fast and slow adaptation that we identified in frog hair cells with the inferred-shift analysis were also present in the mouse (Figures 2I–2L), although less prominent; for example, τfast decreased (from ∼12 ms to <8 ms) with our largest stimuli (Figures 2K and 2L). Moreover, the extent of fast adaptation was proportional to Po, yielding an Xe(fast)∞ of 0.76 μm; that this value is larger than that of frog is not surprising, given the smaller value of γ in mouse (0.05). These results show that fast positive adaptation in mouse vestibular hair cells is mechanistically similar to that in frog saccule hair cells, as shown previously (Vollrath and Eatock, 2003Vollrath M.A. Eatock R.A. Time course and extent of mechanotransducer adaptation in mouse utricular hair cells: comparison with frog saccular hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2676-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, the properties of slow positive adaptation in mouse vestibular hair cells were similar to those in frog vestibular cells. The relation between displacement and slow-adaptation rate in mouse was curved upward and was well fit with Equation S8, the model used for frog adaptation (Figure 2I, inset); the rate constant for slow adaptation was 22 s−1. Again, this result is most consistent with the release model for slow adaptation. As reported previously (Vollrath and Eatock, 2003Vollrath M.A. Eatock R.A. Time course and extent of mechanotransducer adaptation in mouse utricular hair cells: comparison with frog saccular hair cells.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2676-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the relationship between the total extent of adaptation and displacement in mouse hair cells was not linear (Figure 2J). Our data were fit well with a second-order polynomial with positive parameter values and were consistent with an extent spring that decreases in stiffness with increasing displacement. Rates and extents of fast and slow adaptation varied substantially from cell to cell, particularly in the mouse utricle. We found no correlation between the rates of fast and slow adaptation in individual frog or mouse hair cells (Figure 3A ). By contrast, when we compared slopes of linear fits to displacement-extent plots, we found a strong inverse correlation (R = 0.90 for all mouse cells) between the slopes of the fast and slow adaptation plots in individual vestibular hair cells, even in cells of different genotypes; a cell with a higher extent of fast adaptation had little slow adaptation and vice versa (Figure 3B). Because the slow and fast extents need not add to a constant value, the presence of the inverse correlation is an important consideration. The release model predicts this relationship because progression of fast adaptation reduces the force that drives slow adaptation, and the adaptation motor need not slip as far to reduce tension. The channel-reclosure model predicts the opposite: the extent of slow adaptation will increase with more fast adaptation. Another explanation for the plateau in slow adaptation rate for small displacements (Figures 2D and 2J) is that the adaptation motor is deprived of Ca2+ because fast adaptation closes channels. However, this explanation cannot explain the data of Figure 3B, since the adaptation extents were derived from data spanning the entire displacement range, not just over the narrow range in which channel closure might affect Ca2+ levels. When bundles are moved in the negative direction, adaptation responds to the reduced gating-spring tension by generating force, thereby restoring sensitivity. We assessed negative adaptation by moving hair bundles sufficiently far in the negative direction that channels stayed closed, despite adaptation; upon return of the bundle to rest, an overshoot current developed whose amplitude reflected the extent of adaptation during the stimulus (Figure 4A ). As reported previously (Hirono et al., 2004Hirono M. Denis C.S. Richardson G.P. Gillespie P.G. Hair cells require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for mechanical transduction and adaptation.Neuron. 2004; 44: 309-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), negative adaptation in frog hair cells occurred in two phases, one fast and exponential and the second slower and linear (Figure 4B). In 12 frog cells, the time constant for the fast phase was 10 ± 2 ms, and its amplitude (in tip coordinates) was 0.12 ± 0.02 μm (initial rate of 12 μm/s), while the rate of the slow linear phase was 0.97 ± 0.15 μm/s. We conclude that the fast phase corresponds to reversal of the fast adaptation release (as Ca2+ entry is blocked), and the slow phase results from adaptation-motor myosins cyclically climbing the stereocilia actin cores. Adaptation to negative steps in mouse vestibular hair cells also showed fast exponential and slow linear phases (Figures 4C and 4D). In 12 C57BL/6 control cells, the time constant for the fast phase was 34 ± 13 ms, and its amplitude was 0.27 ± 0.04 μm; averaging rates from individual cells, the initial rate was 18 ± 5 μm/s. The rate of the slow linear phase was 0.38 ± 0.10 μm/s. We used a chemical-genetic strategy (Holt et al., 2002Holt J.R. Gillespie S.K. Provance D.W. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Corey D.P. Mercer J.A.

The release model could be satisfied if Myo1c itself dissociates from actin or changes configuration rapidly in response to force and Ca2+ (Hudspeth and Gillespie, 1994Hudspeth A.J. Gillespie P.G.

To allow us to specifically and selectively arrest all Myo1c in stereocilia and prevent its mechanical movements, we generated mice with a targeted gene replacement that introduced the Y61G mutation into both Myo1c alleles. This mutation sensitizes Myo1c to N6-modified ADP analogs; for example, N6(2-methyl butyl) ADP (NMB-ADP) blocked Y61G-Myo1c activity while having little effect on wild-type Myo1c (Gillespie et al., 1999Gillespie P.G. Gillespie S.K. Mercer J.A. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Engineering of the myosin-Iβ nucleotide-binding pocket to create selective sensitivity to N6-modified ADP analogs.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31373-31381Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although we previously generated a transgenic mouse expressing Y61G-Myo1c (Holt et al., 2002Holt J.R. Gillespie S.K. Provance D.W. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Corey D.P. Mercer J.A. Gillespie P.G. A chemical-genetic strategy implicates myosin-1c in adaptation by hair cells.Cell. 2002; 108: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), relatively poor expression of the transgene ensured that wild-type Myo1c was the majority of the myosin-1c protein in those mice. In our studies of slow adaptation, the presence of a minority of mutant Myo1c tightly bound to actin was sufficient to arrest the movement of a plaque of Myo1c. We introduced the Y61G mutation and a loxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette into a targeting construct (Figure 5A ), electroporated the construct into mouse embryonic stem cells, and injected targeted ES cells into blastocysts. We generated one chimeric mouse that transmitted the Y61G mutation to subsequent generations. Mice positive for Y61G were crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase to remove the neomycin cassette (Figure 5B) and backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice. Myo1c levels in wild-type and homozygous Y61G mice were nearly identical in all tissues examined (Figure 5C). Moreover, immunoblotting with an antibody that specifically recognizes the Y61G mutant demonstrated directly that Y61G-Myo1c was expressed in the auditory and vestibular systems of Y61G mice (Figure 5D). We previously used rat Myo1c to characterize the Y61G mutation (Gillespie et al., 1999Gillespie P.G. Gillespie S.K. Mercer J.A. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Engineering of the myosin-Iβ nucleotide-binding pocket to create selective sensitivity to N6-modified ADP analogs.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31373-31381Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because mouse Myo1c differs from rat Myo1c at several amino acid residues, including residue 62 (Thr in rat, Ser in mouse), we reinvestigated the inhibition of Myo1c activity by NMB-ADP. After expressing full-length wild-type and Y61G mouse Myo1c using baculoviruses, we purified these proteins and measured their ATPase activities. Y61G-Myo1c hydrolyzed ATP with a slightly lower Km (9 ± 2 μM; n = 4) than did WT-Myo1c (17 ± 5 μM; n = 4). NMB-ADP was a potent inhibitor of Y61G-Myo1c ATPase activity. Inhibition of WT-Myo1c required more than 150-fold more NMB-ADP (Ki = 119 ± 10 μM; n = 4) than was required for inhibition of Y61G-Myo1c (0.75 ± 0.10 μM; n = 4) (Figure 5E), indicating that this mutant-inhibitor combination is suitable for examination of the function of mouse Myo1c. The effect of NMB-ADP on mutant and wild-type Myo1c also was assessed using an in vitro motility assay (Figure 5F). In the presence of 1 mM EGTA, wild-type mouse Myo1c moved actin filaments at 12.4 ± 0.8 nm/s (mean ± SE; n = 323 filaments). As with the rat mutant, mouse Y61G-Myo1c (25.0 ± 0.9 nm/s; n = 317) moved actin filaments faster than wt. In the presence of 2 mM ATP, NMB-ADP (250 μM) had little effect on WT-Myo1c motility (11.0 ± 0.3 nm/s; n = 363) but nearly completely inhibited motility with Y61G-Myo1c (2.7 ± 0.1 nm/s; n = 494). Ca2+ slowed both wt (6.2 ± 0.3 nm/s; n = 329) and Y61G (12.4 ± 1.1 nm/s; n = 243) Myo1c. The relative fraction of immobile filaments was larger in each case; we suggest tha"

To address this, we delivered odorants to the left or right of the nose, and contrasted olfactory left versus right localization with olfactory identification during brain imaging. We found nostril-specific responses in primary olfactory cortex that were predictive of the accuracy of left versus right localization, thus providing a neural substrate for the behavior described by von Békésy. Additionally, left versus right localization preferentially engaged a portion of the superior temporal gyrus previously implicated in visual and auditory localization, suggesting that localization information extracted from smell was then processed in a convergent brain system for spatial representation of multisensory inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2052202586,"Studies with purified aggregates of endotoxin have revealed the importance of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP)-dependent extraction and transfer of individual endotoxin molecules to CD14 in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent cell activation. Endotoxin is normally embedded in the outer membrane of intact Gram-negative bacteria and shed membrane vesicles (""blebs""). However, the ability of LBP and CD14 to efficiently promote TLR4-dependent cell activation by membrane-associated endotoxin has not been studied extensively. In this study, we used an acetate auxotroph of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> serogroup B to facilitate metabolic labeling of bacterial endotoxin and compared interactions of purified endotoxin aggregates and of membrane-associated endotoxin with LBP, CD14, and endotoxin-responsive cells. The endotoxin, phospholipid, and protein composition of the recovered blebs indicate that the blebs derive from the bacterial outer membrane. Proteomic analysis revealed an unusual enrichment in highly cationic (pI > 9) proteins. Both purified endotoxin aggregates and blebs activate monocytes and endothelial cells in a LBP-, CD14-, and TLR4/MD-2-dependent fashion, but the blebs were 3-10-fold less potent when normalized for the amount of endotoxin added. Differences in potency correlated with differences in efficiency of LBP-dependent delivery to and extraction of endotoxin by CD14. Both membrane phospholipids and endotoxin are extracted by LBP/soluble CD14 (sCD14) treatment, but only endotoxin·sCD14 reacts with MD-2 and activates cells. These findings indicate that the proinflammatory potency of endotoxin may be regulated not only by the intrinsic structural properties of endotoxin but also by its association with neighboring molecules in the outer membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2034243446,It is not fully understood how NMDAR-dependent LTD causes Ca2+-dependent endocytosis of AMPARs. Here we show that the neuronal Ca2+ sensor hippocalcin binds the β2-adaptin subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex and that along with GluR2 these coimmunoprecipitate in a Ca2+-sensitive manner. Infusion of a truncated mutant of hippocalcin (HIP2-72) that lacks the Ca2+ binding domains prevents synaptically evoked LTD but has no effect on LTP. These data indicate that the AP2-hippocalcin complex acts as a Ca2+ sensor that couples NMDAR-dependent activation to regulated endocytosis of AMPARs during LTD.
https://openalex.org/W1989145646,"Recent studies on the sorting of peroxisomal membrane proteins challenge the long-standing model in which peroxisomes are considered to be autonomous organelles that multiply by growth and division. Here, we present data lending support to the idea that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in sorting of the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex3p, a protein required early in peroxisome biogenesis. First, we show that the introduction of an artificial glycosylation site into the N terminus of Pex3p leads to partial N-linked core glycosylation, indicative of insertion into the ER membrane. Second, when FLAG-tagged Pex3p is equipped with an ER targeting signal, it can restore peroxisome formation in pex3Δ cells. Importantly, FLAG antibodies that specifically recognize the processed Pex3p show that the signal peptide of the fusion protein is efficiently cleaved off and that the processed protein localizes to peroxisomes. In contrast, a Pex3p construct in which cleavage of the signal peptide is blocked by a mutation localizes to the ER and the cytosol and cannot complement pex3Δ cells. Together, these results strongly suggest that ER-targeted Pex3p indeed routes via the ER to peroxisomes, and we hypothesize that this pathway is also used by endogenous Pex3p.

Peroxisomes are eukaryotic organelles surrounded by a single membrane. Depending on organism and cell type they can have different functions, two of which are well conserved, i.e. hydrogen peroxide decomposition and fatty acid β-oxidation. Peroxisome biogenesis is carried out by so-called peroxins encoded by PEX genes, 32 of which have been identified so far (1Distel B. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Blobel G. Crane D.I. Cregg J.M. Dodt G.

Peroxisomal matrix proteins are synthesized on free polyribosomes and posttranslationally imported into peroxisomes. Targeting of peroxisomal matrix proteins from the cytosol to peroxisomes is mediated by two types of peroxisomal targeting signals, PTS1 and PTS2, that are recognized by the corresponding mobile import receptors Pex5p and Pex7p, respectively (for review, see Ref. 3Purdue P.E.

Although trafficking of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; SP, signal peptide; PTS, peroxisomal targeting signal; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; GFP, green fluorescent protein; COP, coat protein. is less well understood, two observations indicate that distinct pathways exist for targeting of membrane and matrix proteins. First, in most pex mutants PMPs are correctly targeted to peroxisomal remnants (membrane structures lacking peroxisomal matrix proteins), whereas matrix proteins are found in the cytosol. The only pex mutants in which peroxisomal remnants are absent and PMPs are mislocalized and degraded are pex3 and pex19 in yeast and pex3, pex16, and pex19 in mammals (4Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y.

This indicates that Pex3D, Pex16p, and Pex19p play important roles in peroxisomal membrane biogenesis in these organisms. Second, PMPs do not contain a PTS1 or PTS2 but, rather, possess a distinct membrane peroxisomal targeting signal consisting of a transmembrane domain in conjunction with a cluster of basic residues that frequently also contains a number of hydrophobic residues (7Dyer J.M.

These authors show that Pex19p functions as a chaperone and import receptor for PMPs, stabilizing newly synthesized PMPs and specifically interacting with the hydrophobic domains of the membrane peroxisomal targeting signals in these proteins. The fact that Pex19p is a predominantly cytosolic protein, with only a small percentage (<5%) localized to peroxisomes, suggests that it is a shuttling receptor, similar to Pex5p and Pex7p, binding its PMP cargo in the cytosol followed by transport to the peroxisome (13James G.L.

Interestingly, peroxisomal targeting of Pex3p is not dependent on Pex19p, which has led to the proposal that two distinct membrane peroxisomal targeting signal pathways exist, i.e. Pex19p-dependent (class I) and Pex19p-independent (class II) (12Jones J.M.

It has been envisaged, therefore, that the ER plays a role in peroxisome biogenesis, triggering the formation of new peroxisomes, which would imply that at least some PMPs target to peroxisomes via the ER. Indeed, targeting of PMPs to the ER has been described. First, Pex2p and Pex16p of Yarrowia lipolytica are N-glycosylated, a process specific for the ER (28Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2789-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Importantly, N-glycosylated Pex2p and Pex16p localized to peroxisomes, indicating that in Y. lipolytica these two PMPs route via the ER to peroxisomes. However, in other organisms there is no evidence for N-glycosylation of these or other peroxins. Second, in mouse dendritic cells Pex13p is predominantly located in a specialized ER subdomain that is connected with a peroxisomal reticulum, from which peroxisomes appear to originate (29Geuze H.J. Murk J.L. Stroobants A.K. Griffith J.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Koster A.J. Verkleij A.J. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2900-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Third, Hansenula polymorpha Pex3p has been suggested to route to the ER in view of the fact that a fusion of the N-terminal 16 amino acids of Pex3p efficiently targets a marker protein to the ER (21Baerends R.J. Rasmussen S.W. Hilbrands R.E. van der Heide M. Faber K.N. Reuvekamp P.T. Kiel J.A. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8887-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Fourth, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the integral PMP Pex15p is present in the ER when it is overexpressed or when 30 amino acids are deleted from the C terminus (30Elgersma Y. Kwast L. van den Berg M. Snyder W.B. Distel B. Subramani S. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7326-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Despite increasing evidence that some PMPs may reach the peroxisome via the ER, it remains unclear whether the ER plays an essential, general role in PMP routing. Arguments against such a role are divers (for an in depth discussion, see Ref. 3Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 701-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For example, inhibitors of COPI and COPII that block vesicular transport in the early secretory pathway do not have an effect on PMP targeting (31Voorn-Brouwer T. Kragt A. Tabak H.F. Distel B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2199-2204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32South S.T. Sacksteder K.A. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1345-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Also, mutants of the ER translocation factors Sec61p or its homologue Ssh1p do not inhibit peroxisome biogenesis (33South S.T. Baumgart E. Gould S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12027-12031Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, in many studies that reported targeting of PMPs to the ER, overexpressed or truncated PMPs were used, which may have caused mislocalization (21Baerends R.J. Rasmussen S.W.

In an attempt to shed further light on the possible involvement of the ER in PMP sorting, we studied the targeting of Pex3p in S. cerevisiae, making use of manipulated versions of the protein. In one series of experiments, we introduced a recognition site for ER-specific, N-linked core glycosylation and show that Pex3p is indeed modified. We also fused the signal peptide of the ER protein invertase to Pex3p and demonstrate that the construct is efficiently processed. Importantly, the processed Pex3p reaches the peroxisome and can rescue the pex phenotype of a pex3Δ strain, whereas a construct in which cleavage of the signal peptide is blocked fails to do so. Together, these studies provide strong evidence for an ER-to-peroxisome pathway of Pex3p. Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—Yeast strains used in this study were S. cerevisiae wild-type BJ1991 (Matα, leu2, trp1, ura3-251, prb1-1122, pep4-3, gal2), wild-type UTL-7A (Mata, ura3-52, trp1, leu2-3/112), pex3ΔBJ1991 (Matα, pex3::kanMX4, leu2, trp1, ura3-251, prb1-1122, pep4-3, gal2), and pex3ΔUTL-7A (Mata, pex3::LEU2, ura3-52, trp1, leu2-3/112). Yeast transformants were selected and grown on minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB-WO) (Difco), 2% glucose, and amino acids (20-30 μg/ml) as needed. The liquid media used for culturing of the cells for total protein isolation and (immuno)fluorescence microscopy contained 0.5% potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.1% (v/v) oleate, and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 40. Before shifting to this medium cells were grown on 0.67% YNB-WO containing 0.3% glucose for at least 24 h. For galactose induction experiments cells were precultured on 0.3% glucose medium (see above) and subsequently shifted to liquid media containing 2% galactose, 0.5% potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.3% yeast extract, 0.5% peptone, 0.1% (v/v) oleate, and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 40. Precultured cells were either harvested and resuspended or 1:10-diluted in this galactose media. Oleate plates contained 0.67% YNB-WO, 0.1% oleate (v/v), 0.5% (v/v) Tween 40, 2% agar, and amino acids as needed. Cloning Procedures—Standard techniques for DNA manipulations were used (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pAsk18 was generated by cloning the NarI-BamHI fragment of pEl130 containing the catalase promoter and the NH tag (MQDLPGNDNSTAGGS, corresponding to the N terminus of the mature hemagglutinin protein) in front of the BamHI-SphI-cloned open reading frame of PEX3 in YCplac33 (38Elgersma Y.

All the GAL1/10 promoter-controlled expression constructs are based on the EcoRI-SacI GAL1/10 promoter of pA20 (40Stroobants A.K. Hettema E.H. van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which was cloned NarI-SacI in front of PEX3 in pAsk18, generating pAsk19. The SP-Pex3p expression plasmid was constructed by cloning the SacI-HindIII SP-GFP-HDEL fragment of pEw109 (41Hettema E.H. Ruigrok C.C.M. Koerkamp M.G. van den Berg M. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Braakman I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), of which the HindIII end was made blunt by the Klenow polymerase, into the SacI-SmaI sites of pAsk30, an YCplac22-derived plasmid that contained an EcoRI-SacI GAL1/10 promoter fragment. This resulted in plasmid pAsk37. By PCR with primers PEX3Eag-F and PEX3Myc-R PEX3-Myc was constructed (see TABLE ONE for primers used in this study). The PCR product was cloned EagI-SphI into pAsk37, generating pAsk52. Because the Myc tag was not used in this study for antibody recognition, SP-Pex3-Myc is referred to as SP-Pex3p.TABLE ONEPrimers used in this studyNameSequencePEX3-F-207CCGGAATTCAGCTAAGATGTCGTTAACAAGPEX3-R-1GCCGAGCTCCCTTTTAGTGGTTTGCCTCCPEX3Eag-FAATTATCGGCCGTTCCAAATCAAAGATCACGTTCGPEX3-RACATGCATGCTTAAGGCTTGAAGGAAAACGAGSP-FCGAGCTCATCACACAAACAAACFLAGSP-RCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCGCAGATATTTTGGCTGCAAAACFLAGPEX3-FGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGGATCCGCCCCAAATCAAAGATCACGFLAGSP*Y-RCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCATAAGATATTTTGGCTGCAAAACFLAG-F1GCCGAGCTCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGPEX3Myc-RACATGCATGCTTACAAATCTTCTTCAGAAATCAATTTTTGTTCAGAACCAGAACCCTGCAGAGGCTTGAAGGAAAA CGAGC Open table in a new tab The SP-FLAG-Pex3p fusion protein (consisting of the signal peptide of invertase (SUC2), the FLAG epitope, and Pex3p) was generated using gene assembly by overlap extensions. Primers SP-F and FLAGSP-R were used to amplify the DNA encoding the SP sequence. The second pair of primers (FLAGPEX3-F and PEX3-R) was used to amplify the PEX3 open reading frame lacking the ATG. Templates for the amplification of the SP and the PEX3 open reading frame were pAsk52 and pAsK45, respectively. Primers FLAGSP-R and FLAGPEX3-F contained an additional overlapping sequence, which encoded the FLAG epitope (DYK-DDDDK). The two sets of primers were used in two separate amplification reactions to amplify the overlapping DNA fragments, which were gel-purified using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The overlapping fragments were mixed and used in a single amplification cycle without primers to create double-stranded SP-FLAG-PEX3 DNA. This DNA was amplified in a third reaction by primers SP-F and PEX3-R and cloned SacI-SphI behind the EcoRI-SacI-cloned GAL1/10 promoter into a YCplac22-based plasmid (39Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar), resulting in pAsk56. SP*-FLAG-Pex3p is a point mutant of SP-FLAG-Pex3p in which the original alanine at position -1 relative to the signal peptide cleavage site is substituted for a tyrosine. SP*-FLAG-PEX3 was assembled in a similar way as SP-FLAG-PEX3 with the use of primers SP-F, FLAGSP*Y-R, FLAGPEX3-F, and PEX3-R. Met-FLAG-PEX3 was generated by PCR on pAsK54 with primers FLAG-F1 and PEX3-R. Both SP*-FLAG-PEX3 and Met-FLAG-PEX3 were cloned like SP-FLAG-PEX3 downstream of the EcoRI-SacI-cloned GAL1/10 promoter, resulting in pAsK54 and pAsK68, respectively. The GAL1/10 promoter in pAsk54, pAsK56, and pAsK68 was replaced by the 207-bp EcoRI-SacI PEX3 promoter fragment generated by PCR with primers PEX3-F-207 and PEX3-R-1 from genomic DNA, resulting in pAsK77, pAsK78, and pAsK79, respectively. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) Digestion—Endo H digestion was carried out essentially as described by Coligan et al. (42Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Two A600 equivalents of cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Protein extracts were made as described (see “Miscellaneous”). The protein sample was dissolved in 50 μl of 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% SDS and heat-denatured for 5 min at 100 °C. To the denatured protein sample 10 μl of 0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 38 μl of deionized water, 1 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μl (5 units/μl) of Endo H (Roche Applied Science) was added. For the control digestion the same reagents were added, but the enzyme was substituted by water. Samples were incubated overnight at 30-35 °C. To inactivate Endo H, samples were heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Antibodies—Antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-Pex3p (a kind gift from Prof. Dr. R. Erdmann, rabbit polyclonal anti-NH (a kind gift from Dr. P. van der Sluijs), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M1 (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit polyclonal anti-3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, rabbit polyclonal anti-Kar2p, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit, and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, West Grove PA). Immunofluorescence and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as previously described (43Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Blocking solution contained 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1× Tris-buffered saline. Samples were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody. Mowiol (Hoechst) was used as mounting solution. Cells were examined under a Zeiss Axiophot 2 microscope, and images were captured by a Coolpix HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and processed in Adobe Photoshop. For immunocytochemistry oleate-induced cells were fixed and prepared as described (6Hettema E.H. Girzalsky W. van den Berg M. Erdmann R. Distel B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling was performed on ultrathin sections using antibodies against 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and gold-conjugated protein A. Miscellaneous—Protein extracts were prepared by breaking the cells with glass beads and acid precipitated as described (44Elgersma Y. Kwast L. Klein A. Voorn-Brouwer T. van den Berg M. Metzig B. America T. Tabak H.F. Distel B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described (45Bottger G. Barnett P. Klein A.T. Kragt A. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3963-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was detected using either goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated by alkaline phosphatase with 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (BCIP/NBT) as detection reagent or goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated by horseradish-peroxidase in combination with ECL reagents from Amersham Biosciences. The SignalP server was used to predict the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP) (46Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5660) Google Scholar). NH-tagged Pex3p Is N-Glycosylated and Localizes to the ER—Pex3p is an integral PMP with a predicted type I topology (Nlumen-Ccytosol). In an attempt to find evidence for routing of Pex3p through the ER, we epitope-tagged full-length Pex3p at its N terminus with a synthetic NH tag (MQDLPGNDNSTAGGS), which corresponds to the N terminus of mature hemagglutinin and contains a single N-glycosylation site (NH-Pex3p, see Fig. 1 and Ref. (38Elgersma Y. Vos A. van den Berg M. van Roermund C.W. van der Sluijs P. Distel B. Tabak H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). pex3Δ cells expressing NH-Pex3p from the strong catalase promoter were first analyzed for growth on oleate as the sole carbon source and for peroxisomal import of PTS1-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP-SKL). These experiments showed that NH-Pex3p can rescue the pex phenotype of pex3Δ cells and, thus, is a functional protein (results not shown). To analyze the glycosylation status of the NH-Pex3 protein in oleate-induced pex3Δ cells, crude cellular extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis using NH and Pex3p antibodies. As controls, total cell lysates of oleate-induced untransformed wild-type and pex3Δ cells were also analyzed. Both Pex3p and NH antibodies detected two protein bands of about 50 and 52 kDa, respectively, in the pex3Δ strain expressing NH-Pex3p (Fig. 2A, lane 3). In contrast, the Pex3p antibody recognized only one protein band of 48 kDa in untransformed wild-type cells, corresponding to endogenous Pex3p (lane 1). None of the three bands were present in extracts from pex3Δ cells (lane 2). Taken together, the results imply that about 50% of NH-tagged Pex3p is modified, whereas endogenous Pex3p is not. To identify the modification as glycosylation, extracts of pex3Δ cells expressing NH-Pex3p were incubated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H, Fig. 2B). As a result of Endo H treatment, the slower migrating NH-Pex3p band disappeared, demonstrating that NH-Pex3p is indeed modified by N-linked core glycosylation. The difference in apparent molecular mass of about 2 kDa between Endo H-treated and untreated samples suggested that Pex3p receives a single core oligosaccharide chain (42Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Because N-linked core glycosylation is an ER-specific modification, this result implies that a substantial portion of NH-Pex3p has been in the ER.FIGURE 2N-Glycosylation of NH-Pex3p.

Trichloroacetic acid lysates of oleate-induced pex3Δ cells expressing NH-Pex3p under the control of the catalase promoter were analyzed by immunoblotting using NH and Pex3p antibodies.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To address this problem, we cloned NH-PEX3 downstream of the inducible galactose promoter (PGAL1/10), which is repressed by glucose and induced in galactose-containing media. Anti-NH immunoblotting of total lysates from pex3Δ cells expressing PGAL1/10-NH-PEX3 showed that expression of the protein was indeed repressed in media containing 0.3% glucose (Fig. 3, lane 1) and that there was a gradual increase in expression upon shifting the cells to rich oleate media containing 2% galactose (lanes 2-5). Importantly, at low expression levels both glycosylated and unglycosylated NH-Pex3p were detected, whereas the ratio of the two bands remained the same at higher expression levels. This implies that NH-Pex3p is not located in the ER as a result of overexpression but, rather, as part of a normal routing process. However, Nycodenz gradient analysis revealed that N-glycosylated NH-Pex3p largely co-migrated with Dpm1p (an ER membrane marker) but not with the peroxisomal membrane marker Ant1p, whereas most of the unmodified NH-Pex3p was detected in peroxisomes (data not shown). This seems to suggest that the N-glycosylation of NH-Pex3p turns the protein"
https://openalex.org/W2105030314,"Signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) is mediated by their intrinsic kinase activity. Typically, kinase-activating mutations result in ligand-independent signaling and gain-of-function phenotypes. Like other RTKs, Ephs require kinase activity to signal, but signaling by Ephs in vitro also requires clustering by their membrane bound ephrin ligands. The relative importance of Eph kinase activity and clustering for in vivo functions is unknown. We find that knockin mice expressing a mutant form of EphA4 (EphA4EE), whose kinase is constitutively activated in the absence of ephrinB ligands, are deficient in the development of thalamocortical projections and some aspects of central pattern generator rhythmicity. Surprisingly, other functions of EphA4 were regulated normally by EphA4EE, including midline axon guidance, hindlimb locomotion, in vitro growth cone collapse, and phosphorylation of ephexin1. These results suggest that signaling of Eph RTKs follows a multistep process of induced kinase activity and higher-order clustering different from RTKs responding to soluble ligands."

To determine whether LASS5 is a bona fide dihydroceramide synthase or, alternatively, whether it modifies an endogenous dihydroceramide synthase, we over-expressed LASS5 with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the C terminus, solubilized it using digitonin, and purified it by immunoprecipitation. Solubilized LASS5-HA displays the same fatty acid selectivity as the membrane-bound enzyme. After elution from agarose beads, only one band could be detected by SDS-PAGE, and its identity was confirmed to be LASS5 by mass spectrometry.

Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35642-35649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), whereas over-expression of LASS5 leads to an increase of ceramide containing palmitic acid (9Riebeling C.

However, it is not known whether these genes modify an endogenous ceramide synthase activity, and thereby confer fatty acid selectivity, or whether the LASS proteins themselves are bona fide dihydroceramide synthases. We have now purified, by immunoprecipitation, LASS5 with an HA tag at the C terminus and demonstrate here that it is a genuine dihydroceramide synthase that displays the same fatty acid selectivity as seen upon its over-expression in mammalian cells. This is the first biochemical isolation of a mammalian dihydroceramide synthase and paves the way for studying the role of LASS proteins in regulating ceramide production both for SL biosynthesis and for the regulation of the defined aspects of cell physiology in which it plays vital roles. Materials—1-[14C]Palmitoyl-CoA (specific activity, 60 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences, and 1-[14C]stearoyl-CoA (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Fumonisin B1, defatted bovine serum albumin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, and aprotinin were from Sigma. Sphinganine, sphingosine, palmitoylsphingosine, and stearoylsphingosine were from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Digitonin was from Sigma or Calbiochem. A monoclonal anti-HA-agarose conjugate (clone HA-7) was from Sigma, a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Y-11) and protein A-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Silica gel 60 TLC plates were from Merck. All solvents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Biolab (Jerusalem, Israel). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections using LASS5-HA (9Riebeling C. Allegood J.C. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43452-43459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) were performed by the calcium phosphate method. Transfections were also performed with pcDNA-HA as a control. Solubilization of LASS5-HA—293T cells, at ∼90% confluency, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and removed from culture dishes using trypsin (0.05%, w/v). After centrifugation (4 min, 150 × gav) cell pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation (4 min, 150 × gav) and then homogenized in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, and 2 mm MgCl2 containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin). Digitonin was added to the homogenate to give a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and after 1 h at 4°C, the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was used for subsequent purification steps. Immunoprecipitation of LASS5-HA—The digitonin-solubilized supernatant was concentrated using an iCON concentrator (Pierce) and then incubated with protein A-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. After removal of protein A-agarose by centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with an anti-HA agarose conjugate overnight at 4 °C. The conjugate was then pelleted by centrifugation and washed with the same HEPES buffer used for homogenization followed by a wash with 1 m NaCl. LASS5-HA was eluted from the beads using 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and immediately neutralized using 1 m Trizma (Tris base), pH 11. The eluate was concentrated using an iCON concentrator, and in some cases, DOPC or DOPS liposomes prepared as described (11Bodennec J. Pelled D. Riebeling C. Trajkovic S. Futerman A.H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), were added to the concentrated eluate prior to analysis of dihydroceramide synthase activity. The composition of the eluate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide gel) and Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody. Control immunoprecipitations were performed using cells that had been transfected with pcDNA-HA. Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were excised from the SDS gel and subsequently reduced, alkylated, and in-gel-digested for 18 h with bovine trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics) at a concentration of 12.5 ng/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C. An extracted peptide solution was dried for subsequent matrix-assisted laser desorption/time of flight ionization (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analyses. Aliquots of the extracted peptide mixture and electroeluted proteins, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or a mixture of formic acid/isopropanol/H20 (1/3/2; v/v/v), were used for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Peptide fingerprinting was performed on a Bruker Reflex IIITM MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a delayed extraction ion source, a reflector, and a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Dihydroceramide Synthase Assay—For cell fractions, 500 μg of protein (determined using BCA reagent (Pierce)) was incubated with 15 μm sphinganine and 20 μm defatted bovine serum albumin (12Hirschberg K. Rodger J. Futerman A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) for 5 min at 37 °C with or without fumonisin B1 (20 μm), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of either 0.12 μCi of 1-[14C]palmitoyl-CoA or 0.12 μCi of 1-[14C]stearoyl-CoA for a further 20 min (9Riebeling C.

When immunoprecipitated LASS5-HA was assayed, either sphinganine or sphingosine was used as long chain base, and the reaction time was 1 h. Lipids were extracted and levels of dihydroceramide synthesis analyzed by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/2 m ammonium hydroxide (40/10/1; v/v/v) as the developing solvent and using palmitoylsphingosine and stearoylsphingosine as standards. Lipids were visualized using a phosphorimaging screen (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan), recovered from TLC plates by scraping the silica directly into scintillation vials, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Initial experiments were performed to establish a means to solubilize membrane-bound LASS5-HA. Digitonin, which was previously used to solubilize Lag1p (13Vallee B. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 730-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), a yeast LASS homolog (14Guillas I. Kirchman P.A. Chuard R. Pfefferli M. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Conzelmann A.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), was able to solubilize LASS5-HA and preserve dihydroceramide synthase activity. Most of the dihydroceramide synthase activity was recovered in the digitoninsolubilized supernatant, which correlated with levels of LASS5-HA detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Digitonin-solubilized LASS5-HA displayed the same fatty acid specificity as membranebound LASS5, showing an ∼10-fold higher activity toward palmitoyl-CoA than toward stearoyl-CoA (Fig. 1B), and was inhibited by the (dihydro)ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 (16Merrill A.H. Liotta D.C. Riley R. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 218-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to a similar extent as observed in the homogenate (Fig. 1B). Digitonin-solubilized LASS5-HA was subsequently immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA agarose conjugate and eluted using 100 mm glycine. A significant fraction of the immunoprecipitated LASS5-HA could be eluted from the beads (Fig. 2A), and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed only one band, with a molecular mass of ∼48 kDa (Fig. 2B), similar to the predicted molecular mass of LASS5-HA. No other bands could be detected reproducibly either by silver staining of the gel (Fig. 2B) or by Coomassie staining (not shown). The identity of the band as LASS5-HA was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2C) and by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (TABLE ONE). In addition, no other peptides co-migrated with LASS5 (TABLE ONE), which was confirmed by nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (not shown).TABLE ONEMALDI-TOF MS identification of LASS5Measured massTheoretical massMass accuracyPosition in the sequencePeptide sequenceDaDappm694.342694.347-50062-66MLFER710.342710.342062-66MoxLFER902.462902.461+1114-120QLDWSVR908.432908.4320122-127IQCWFR914.472914.4720398-405ATGNLHFR1030.4621030.556-94114-121QLDWSVRK1014.4021014.405-3141-147FCESMoxWR1036.5221036.527-5121-127KIQCWFR1074.5921074.600-867-75FIAKPCALR1140.5821140.613-31131-140NQDKPPTLTK1296.6721296.714-42130-140RNQDKPPTLTK1410.6521410.739-8795-106VFVSVTKYPDEK1566.7421566.840-9895-107VFVSVTKYPDEKR1683.7621683.831-6980-94DSPVNKVEPNDTLEK1773.7221773.793-71173-185CWYNYPYQPLSR Open table in a new tab Eluted LASS5-HA did not show any dihydroceramide synthase activity unless phospholipids were added to the eluate. Of the two phospholipids tested, DOPC was more efficient than DOPS at preserving dihydroceramide synthase activity (Fig. 3A). Moreover, eluted LASS5-HA was highly selective toward palmitoyl-CoA compared with stearoyl-CoA (Fig. 3B), could be inhibited by fumonisin B1, and was able to acylate both sphinganine and sphingosine (Fig. 3C). 3We attempted to determine the extent of recovery and -fold purification of LASS5 from the digitonin-solubilized supernatant. However, because of the low amounts of purified LASS5 protein and the inherent difficulties in estimating the amount of protein after silver staining of the SDS-gel, we can only provide estimates of these values. In three separate experiments, the -fold increase in specific activity of the immunoprecipitated protein compared with the digitonin-solubilized supernatant varied between ∼5,000 and 12,000, and the recovery of LASS5 activity (toward 1-[14C]palmitoyl-CoA as substrate) varied between 26 and 49%. These values are probably underestimates because we have not systematically determined the conditions for optimal activity of purified LASS5. In the current study we have demonstrated that LASS5 is a bona fide (dihydro)ceramide synthase. This is the first time that a mammalian dihydroceramide synthase has been purified, representing one of the last recalcitrant enzymes in the SL biosynthetic pathway (5Futerman A.H. Riezman H. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast to yeast, in which SLs contain only one kind of fatty acid, namely C26, mammalian (dihydro)ceramides contain a wide fatty acid spectrum (2Futerman A.H. Hannun Y.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 4Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). It was formerly assumed that this was due to a lack of specificity of dihydroceramide synthase with respect to the use of fattyacyl-CoAs. However, the discovery of a family of mammalian LASS genes that each synthesizes dihydroceramides containing different fatty acids (at least those characterized to date (8Venkataraman K. Riebeling C. Bodennec J. Riezman H. Allegood J.C. Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol.

J. 2005; 390: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar)) demonstrates that this is not the case. In contrast, yeast have only two highly homologous ceramide synthase genes, LAG1 and LAC1, which together are responsible for the synthesis of C26-ceramides. Evidence is accumulating that ceramides containing specific fatty acids are involved in defined cell functions in mammalian cells (2Futerman A.H. Hannun Y.A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 17Koybasi S. Senkal C.E. Sundararaj K. Spassieva S. Bielawski J. Osta W. Day T.A. Jiang J.C. Jazwinski S.M. Hannun Y.A.

This being the case, it might be expected that individual LASS genes would be expressed in either a tissue-specific (9Riebeling C. Allegood J.C. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43452-43459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 18Xu Z. Zhou J. McCoy D.M. Mallampalli R.K. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1229-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or temporal manner so as to supply specific ceramides for the distinct events in which they are involved. Our demonstration that LASS5 is a bona fide dihydroceramide synthase that selectively utilizes palmitoyl-CoA supports this likelihood and strengthens the hypothesis that specific LASS proteins play distinct roles either in ceramide signaling or in SL metabolism. Evidence for the latter has already been obtained by the observation that C18-ceramide formed by LASS1 is selectively channeled into neutral glyco-SLs but not gangliosides. The availability of purified LASS5 will permit systematic characterization of the reaction mechanism and modes of regulation of a mammalian dihydroceramide synthase (19Kok J.W. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Klappe K. Alexander C. Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21128-21136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The yeast ceramide synthase, Lag1p/Lac1p, was recently purified, and was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with an additional subunit, Lip1p (13Vallee B. Riezman H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 730-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which was absolutely required for yeast ceramide synthesis, at least using C26-fatty acids. No mammalian homologs of Lip1p are found by data base searches, and our demonstration that no other protein is required for the dihydroceramide synthase activity of LASS5 indicates that LASS5 by itself is sufficient for catalytic activity in mammalian cells. However, the dihydroceramide synthase activity of LASS5 is totally dependent on exogenously added phospholipids, whereas no such requirement was observed for yeast Lag1p/Lac1p/Lip1p. Together, these data suggest a unique role for Lip1p in yeast that is not required in mammalian cells, and suggest that the regulation of mammalian (dihydro)ceramide synthesis may differ significantly from that in yeast. We thank Christian Riebeling for the initial cloning of LASS5-HA, Howard Riezman and Beatrice Vallee for sharing unpublished data about the purification of yeast Lag1p/Lac1p/Lip1p, and Dr. Alla Shainskaya from the Mass Spectrometry Unit of the Weizmann Institute of Science for the MALDI-TOF analyses."

Alg13 contains a predicted catalytic domain, but lacks any membrane-spanning domains. Alg14 spans the membrane but lacks any sequences predicted to play a direct role in sugar catalysis. We show that Alg14 functions as a membrane anchor that recruits Alg13 to the cytosolic face of the ER, where catalysis of GlcNAc2-PP-dol occurs. Alg13 and Alg14 physically interact and under normal conditions, are associated with the ER membrane. Overexpression of Alg13 leads to its cytosolic partitioning, as does reduction of Alg14 levels. Concomitant Alg14 overproduction suppresses this cytosolic partitioning of Alg13, demonstrating that Alg14 is both necessary and sufficient for the ER localization of Alg13.

The earliest steps of this lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) synthesis begin on the cytoplasmic face of the ER. Seven sugars, (two N-acetylglucosamines and five mannoses) are sequentially added to dol-P to form Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dol by enzymes that have their catalytic domain on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane and use sugar nucleotide substrates (2Abeijon C.

All of the ALG genes are highly conserved among eukaryotes, although certain unicellular eukaryotes are missing a subset (26Samuelson J. Banerjee S. Magnelli P. Cui J. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1548-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These unicellular organisms consequently produce lipid-linked oligosaccharides that are shorter than Glu3Man9GlcNAc2PP-dol that is produced in S. cerevisiae and in humans. With the exception of Giardia lamblia and Plasmodium falciparum, which produce LLO lacking mannose and glucose, the shortest glycan produced by all eukaryotes that have been examined is Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dol (26Samuelson J. Banerjee S. Magnelli P. Cui J. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1548-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation and essentiality of the proteins synthesizing Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dol underscore the importance of this glycan and the reactions that occur on the cytosolic face of the ER that lead to its assembly. Despite its importance, the identity of several of the enzymes that catalyze the reactions on the cytosolic face of the ER remains a mystery. Using a bioinformatics approach, two S. cerevisiae ORFs (YGL047w and YBR070c) were recently identified that are distantly related to the bacterial MurG UDP-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and that are implicated in playing a role in N-linked glycosylation (27Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Attenuated expression of either of these genes affects the second step of lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthesis, the addition of a β1,4-linked GlcNAc to GlcNAc-PP-dol that produces GlcNAc2-PP-dol on the cytosolic face of the ER (27Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Remarkably, unlike any other eukaryotic ER glycosyltransferases, Ygl047w, which we designate here as Alg13, is predicted to contain a consensus glycosyltransferase catalytic domain but lacks any predicted membrane-spanning domains. The other polypeptide, Ybr070c, which we designate as Alg14, contains several predicted membrane-spanning domains but lacks any sequences that are predicted to participate in sugar transfer. Because Alg13 contains a domain that is strongly related to the catalytic domain found in other UDP-sugar transferases and displays a mutant phenotype that demonstrates its involvement in LLO synthesis, it seems likely to play a direct role in UDP-GlcNAc transfer. The role of Alg14 is less clear, particularly because “split” glycosyltransferases are unprecedented among eukaryotes. In this work we have tested the hypothesis that Alg13 and Alg14 interact on the ER face to form a functional hetero-oligomeric UDP-GlcNAc glycosyltransferase whose membrane-spanning domain and catalytic domain are on separate polypeptides. We demonstrate that these enzymes physically interact with one another on the ER membranes, and that Alg14 is required to recruit Alg13 from the cytosol to the ER. Furthermore although neither of the human Alg13 and Alg14 orthologues can interact with their yeast partners, when co-expressed these proteins can functionally complement the loss of ALG13 or ALG14. We speculate that this enzyme has evaded identification because it is an unusual hetero-oligomeric glycosyltransferase, comprised of at least two distinct polypeptides, both of which are required for LLO biosynthesis. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in TABLE ONE. W303a (MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his3-11 trp1-1 leu2-3,112 can1-100) is the parental strain for all the strains used in work. Epitope tagging and replacement of promoters or chromosomal loci employed PCR-mediated recombination (28Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C.

XGY154 also contain an additional copy of the RPT6 gene and its upstream promoter sequence integrated at the trp1 locus. RPT6 is an essential gene that lies adjacent to ALG13 but that is transcribed from the opposite strand of chromosome VII. We found that replacement of the ALG13 promoter with the GAL1 promoter interferes with normal RPT6 expression. Therefore a DNA fragment, containing the RPT6 ORF and 267 bp of 5′-flanking sequence, was cloned into the TRP1 integration vector, pRS304 (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), linearized, and integrated at the trp1 locus in XGY154. SKY202 was created by replacing the ALG13 allele with a C-terminal HA-tagged ALG13 allele, marked with the S. pombe his5+ gene. The XGY155 strain contains a replacement of the chromosomal ALG13 locus with a C-terminal triple FLAG-tagged ALG13 allele, marked by the S. pombe his5+ gene. XGY156 was generated from XGY155 by replacing 220 base pairs upstream of the ALG14 chromosomal locus with the GAL1 promoter followed by the triple HA epitope, marked with the TRP1 gene. XGY158 was constructed from XGY156 and contains a 3HA-tagged ALG14 allele under its own promoter integrated at ura3 (by integration of pXG202 (see “Plasmid Construction” below) and in addition contains a 3HA-tagged ALG14 allele driven by the glucose repressible GAL1 promoter. XGY166 contains a normal ADE2 allele integrated at the ade2 locus, and the pTiKmRFP plasmid at ura3 locus. pTiKmRFP expresses Kar2-mRFP-HDEL (see “Plasmid Construction”, below). This strain allowed the fluorescent analysis of the Kar2-mRFP-HDEL ER marker using monomeric RFP, without interference of the red pigment that accumulates due to the ade2 mutation. Strains XGY167A and 168 were derived from XGY166 and contain a replacement of the chromosomal ALG13 and ALG14 loci, respectively, with GFP-tagged alleles that are marked with the S. pombe his5+ gene. Plasmid Constructions—Standard molecular biology techniques were used for all plasmid constructions. The correct sequence of all PCR-amplified products was verified by DNA sequencing. The sequences of primers used in this study are available upon request. To express plasmid borne genes from the ALG13 promoter, the promoter sequence of the ALG13 gene was amplified directly from the yeast genome by PCR, digested with XhoI and EcoRI and cloned into the URA3, integrative plasmid, pRS306 (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to generate pXG200. The same strategy was used to create pXG201, which contains the ALG14 promoter. This PCR product was cloned into the KpnI/HindIII sites of pRS306. To express the 3HA-ALG14 gene from the ALG14 promoter, the 3HA-ALG14 gene was amplified from strain XGY151 and cloned into the HindIII/SmaI sites of pXG201 to create pXG202. Linearization of this plasmid with EcoRV within the URA3 gene targets integration at the ura3 locus. pTiKmRFP contains a KAR2-mRFP-HDEL fusion gene (with a ClaI site at the KAR2/mRF-HDEL junction) whose expression is controlled by the constitutive triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI1) promoter. This plasmid contains the 5′-region of the KAR2 ORF, which encodes the first 45 amino acids, in-frame with the mRFP (monomeric red fluorescent protein) gene that lacks its initiating ATG and that contains an HDEL-encoding sequence at the 3′-end, in the SacI/XbaI sites of pTi-Sac. Human ALG13 (GLT28D1) and ALG14 (MGC19780) cDNAs were amplified by PCR using Marathon-Ready™ cDNA derived from human whole brain (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The amplified fragments were digested with HinDIII and XbaI and inserted into expression vector, pFLAG-CMV4 (Sigma) to generate pXG203 (containing FLAG-hALG13) and pXG204 (containing FLAG-hALG14). To express the human ALG13-FLAG-tagged gene from the yeast ALG13 promoter, pXG203 was used as template for PCR to amplify ALG13 with a primer set encoding the FLAG peptide sequence. The product was digested with EcoRI and EcoRV, and cloned into EcoRI/SmaI sites of pXG200. This generated pXG205, a URA3 integration plasmid that expresses FLAG-tagged human ALG13 from the yeast ALG13 promoter. An XhoI/XbaI fragment including the ALG13 promoter and entire hALG13-FLAG fusion gene from pXG205 was cloned into the SalI/XbaI sites of the LEU2, integrative plasmid, pRS305, to create a similar plasmid, pXG206, but marked with LEU2. Linearization of this plasmid with EcoRV, within the LEU2 gene, targets integration at the leu2 locus. To express the human ALG14 homologue from the GAP1 promoter, pXG204 was used as a template to amplify the ALG14-FLAG ORF, with primers tailed with sequences encoding the FLAG tag. The product was digested with SacI and EcoRV, and cloned into SacI/SmaI sites of pTi-Sac (32Gao X.D. Nishikawa A. Dean N. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to generate pXG207. To create pRS304RPT6, the RPT6 gene including its promoter sequence was amplified by PCR, digested with XhoI and EcoRV, and cloned into XhoI/SmaI sites of the TRP1, integrative plasmid pRS304. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Immunoblotting Analysis—Yeast were grown and harvested at logarithmic growth phase (A600 1-3). About 2 × 109 cells were incubated in 1 ml of A-Buffer (100 mm EDTA, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 15 min at 30 °C, spun down, and then resuspended in 0.8 ml of S-Buffer (1.0 m sorbitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.14% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with 50 units/A600 zymolyase 100T (SEIKAGAKU Co.). After incubating at 30 °C for 45∼60 min, during which time 70% of cells were converted to spheroplasts, cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold S-Buffer. The cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors and lysed by Dounce homogenization, with 20 strokes of a Teflon pestle on ice. Unbroken cells and debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min to yield a crude extract. The post 1000 × g supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, which yielded the P13 pellet and the S13 supernatant. The S13 fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to yield the P100 and S100 supernatant. Together with crude extract and S100 fraction, P13 and P100 fraction were resuspended in a suitable mount of lysis buffer and protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). 10 μg of each fraction were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-PVDF membranes (Millipore). To make the membrane fraction that was used in A and B of Fig. 4, exponentially growing yeast cells (10 A600) were homogenized by vortexing with glass beads in ice-cold lysis buffer and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and wall debris. The 3000 × g supernatant was directly centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge. The soluble protein-containing supernatant (S100) was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer. The membrane-containing pellet (P100) was resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer. Equal volumes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-PVDF membranes (Millipore). To make the cellular extracts used in Fig. 7, exponentially growing yeast cells were homogenized by vortexing with glass beads in ice-cold lysis buffer and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and wall debris. The supernatants were collected and used directly for 8% SDS-PAGE to analyze the electrophoretic mobility of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY).FIGURE 7Co-expression of human ALG13 and ALG14 genes rescues the alg13 or alg14 glycosylation defect. Yeast strains containing GAL1p-driven ALG13 (XGY154) or ALG14 (XGY151) harboring plasmids containing the human ALG13 or ALG14 genes (pXG205 and pXG207, respectively), were grown to mid-log phase in YPA medium supplemented with galactose, shifted into YPA supplemented with galactose, or with glucose to repress expression of the ALG13 and ALG14 genes, and grown for 6∼8 h at 30°C. After three repeated passages of growth on glucose or galactose, cells were harvested and crude protein extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein extracts (4 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted with an anti-CPY monoclonal antibody. The positions of the mature and hypoglycosylated forms of CPY lacking 1, 2, 3, or 4 N-linked glycans are indicated (37Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Genetics. 1989; 123: 725-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Alg13-FLAG protein was detected by a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (anti-FLAG M2-AP, Sigma) and detected directly by chemiluminescence (CDP-Star Detection Reagent, Amersham Biosciences). Mouse monoclonal anti-Dpm1 and anti-CPY (Molecular Probes) were used to detect Dpm1p and CPY. Anp1p was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-Anp1 antibody (from Sean Munro). HA-Alg14p, Alg13-HA were detected using 12CA5 monoclonal anti-HA antibody. Primary antibody staining was followed by incubation with a secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) followed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation—Exponentially growing yeast cells were harvested at an A600 of 1-3 and converted to spheroplasts with lyticase. To prepare detergent extracts, spheroplasts from 5-6 Absorbance units of cells were resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) that contained protease inhibitors and 1% digitonin as described (33Gao X.D. Dean N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17718-17727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged proteins in digitonin extracts were immunoprecipitated with Anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science Co.) or Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). After fractionation by SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitates were transferred to Immobilon-PVDF membranes. To detect the FLAG-tagged proteins, the membrane was incubated with a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (ANTI-FLAG M2-AP). To detect the HA-tagged protein, the membrane was incubated with a rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (HA-probe Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technologies). Analysis of GFP and mRFP Fusion Proteins—To visualize the localization of GFP and mRFP fusion proteins, cells were grown to an A600 of 1-3 in YPAD. After washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline + 2% glucose, GFP fluorescence was imaged using the NIBA filter (Olympus), and mRFP fluorescence was imaged using the WIG filter (Olympus) on an Olympus BX50 microscope. Alg13 and Alg14 Physically Interact—Although a role for Alg13 as a glycosyltransferase involved in GlcNAc2-PP-dol synthesis requires its association with the ER membrane, it lacks any membrane-spanning domains. Interestingly, ALG14 encodes an uncharacterized membrane protein that when underproduced, leads to phenotypes similar to that of alg13 (27Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These data suggest a model in which these proteins pair with one another on the cytosolic face of the ER to form a functional hetero-oligomeric UDP-GlcNAc transferase that catalyzes the second step of core oligosaccharide synthesis on the ER. Thus, Alg13 and Alg14 should physically interact. To test this idea, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Yeast strains were constructed that co-express C-terminally FLAG-tagged Alg13 and N-terminally HA-tagged Alg14 (strain XGY158). This strain also contains an ALG14 allele driven by the GAL1-promoter but this allele is repressed when this strain is grown on glucose. Both of these tagged alleles are functional, expressed at physiological levels when grown on glucose, and complemented both the glycosylation defect and growth phenotype of the alg13 and alg14 mutants, respectively (data not shown). Digitonin-containing protein extracts were prepared from these strains and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g to remove any nonspecific protein aggregation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Alg14 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-FLAG antibodies to determine if Alg13 precipitated with Alg14. By this assay, we found that Alg13 co-precipitated with Alg14 with high affinity and specificity (Fig. 1). Co-precipitation of Alg13 with Alg14 depended on the co-expression of Alg14-HA (Fig. 1, lane 6) and was independent of the antibodies used; immunoprecipitation of Alg13-FLAG with anti-FLAG antibodies also resulted in the co-precipitation of Alg14-HA with Alg13-FLAG (Fig. 1, lane 7). In addition, we found no evidence for the co-precipitation of other membrane proteins (e.g. Wbp1 (Fig. 1, lane 8 and data not shown), suggesting that this is a specific interaction. Taken together, these results demonstrate that these proteins physically interact. Alg13 and Alg14 Are Localized at the ER—Both Alg13 and Alg14 should be localized on ER membranes if they pair to form the UDP-GlcNAc transferase that catalyzes the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-dol on the cytosolic face of the ER. To test this idea, we constructed strains that produce GFP-tagged Alg13 and Alg14 at physiological levels to examine their localization in live cells (strains XGY167A and XGY168; see “Experimental Proced"
https://openalex.org/W2069448508,"Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein chaperones cooperate in a protein-folding pathway required by many “client” proteins. The co-chaperone Sti1p coordinates functions of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in this pathway. Sti1p has three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. TPR1 binds Hsp70, TPR2a binds Hsp90, and the ligand for TPR2b is unknown. Although Sti1p is thought to be dedicated to the client folding pathway, we earlier showed that Sti1p regulated Hsp70, independently of Hsp90, in a way that impairs yeast [PSI+] prion propagation. Using this prion system to monitor Sti1p regulation of Hsp70 and an Hsp90-inhibiting compound to monitor Hsp90 regulation, we identified Sti1p mutations that separately affect Hsp70 and Hsp90. TPR1 mutations impaired Sti1p regulation of Hsp70, but deletion of TPR2a and TPR2b did not. Conversely, TPR2a and TPR2b mutations impaired Sti1p regulation of Hsp90, but deletion of TPR1 did not. All Sti1p mutations variously impaired the client folding pathway, which requires both Hsp70 and Hsp90. Thus, Sti1p regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 separately, Hsp90 is implicated as a TPR2b ligand, and mutations separately affecting regulation of either chaperone impair a pathway that is dependent upon both. We further demonstrate that client folding depended upon bridging of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by Sti1p and find conservation of the independent regulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by human Hop1.

We further demonstrate that client folding depended upon bridging of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by Sti1p and find conservation of the independent regulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by human Hop1. Hsp70 and Hsp90 are abundant, essential, and stress-inducible chaperones that assist protein folding. By binding and releasing hydrophobic surfaces on partially folded proteins, Hsp70 plays a general role in helping proteins adopt and maintain native conformations. It also acts in cellular processes during which proteins are partially folded, such as translation and transport across membranes, and protects cells from stress by preventing protein aggregation. Although Hsp90 might also have a general role as a protein chaperone, it is known to act in a well characterized folding pathway for a large number of “client” proteins in the cell, many of which, such as steroid hormone receptors, kinases, and transcription factors, are involved in signaling (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, 2Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Morishima Y. Murphy P.J. Essays Biochem. 2004; 40: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This client folding pathway involves Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Hsp40 as well as many co-chaperones that regulate activity of Hsp90. Client proteins interact first with Hsp40 (3Hernandez M.P. Chadli A. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which helps target them to Hsp70, and then are transferred from Hsp70 to Hsp90 to finish folding. The co-chaperone Sti1p (Hop1 in humans) is thought to facilitate this transfer by binding to both Hsp90 and the substrate-bound Hsp70, forming a physical link between them (4Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P.

Other co-chaperones then bind to Hsp90 while Hop1 and Hsp70 are released from the complex. In vitro, Sti1p both stimulates ATPase activity of Hsp70 and inhibits ATPase activity of Hsp90 (7Wegele H.

These functions of Sti1p agree with data suggesting that in addition to simply bridging Hsp70 and Hsp90, Sti1p and Hop1 affect the client folding pathway through regulation of the conformations and ATPase cycles of the two chaperones (9Johnson B.D.

Tetratricopeptide repeat motifs at the amino terminus (TPR1) 2The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; RT, reverse transcription; GR, glucocorticoid receptor. and middle region (TPR2a) mediate the physical interactions of Sti1p with Hsp70 and Hsp90, respectively. A third TPR region immediately downstream of TPR2a, namely TPR2b, is also important for Sti1p function, but the ligand for this domain is unknown. Sti1p also has smaller regions containing conserved aspartate and proline residues following TPR1 (designated DP1) and following TPR2b (designated DP2). Altering TPR residues of Hop1/Sti1p that are known to be important for making contacts with Hsp70 and Hsp90 predictably reduce the ability of Hop1 to physically interact with them and to function in place of Sti1p in a yeast client folding system (11Scheufler C.

Mutations in DP2, but not DP1, were also shown to be important for Hop1 function and its interaction with human Hsp70. Although Sti1p and Hop1 have been found in complexes without Hsp70 and Hsp90, as a co-chaperone Sti1p is thought to be dedicated to the client folding pathway. Our recent work with the yeast [PSI+] prion, however, showed that Sti1p was required for a mutant Hsp70 (Ssa1-21p) to impair [PSI+] propagation and that [PSI+] was unaffected by various conditions that impair Hsp90 function (14Jones G.W. Song Y. Chung S. Masison D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). SSA1-21 [PSI+] cells thus provide a unique system for monitoring the ability of Sti1p to specifically regulate Hsp70 function. Specific regulation of Hsp90 function by Sti1p is important for cell growth, as depleting Sti1p makes cells hyper-sensitive to lethal effects of compounds such as radicicol that specifically inactivate Hsp90. Because SSA1-21 cells have normal sensitivity to radicicol, which has no effect on [PSI+] propagation, these cells are also useful for monitoring the ability of Sti1p to specifically regulate Hsp90 function. We pursued our hypothesis that Sti1p can independently regulate Hsp70 and Hsp90 by using our system to search for mutations in Sti1p that separately affect [PSI+] and radicicol sensitivity. We identified several such mutations, showing that these phenotypes are dependent upon the ability of Sti1p to regulate Hsp70 and Hsp90 separately. Not unexpectedly, Sti1p mutations that affect Hsp70 function were located in regions known to be important for physical interactions of Sti1p with Hsp70, and those affecting Hsp90 function were in regions important for Sti1p interaction with Hsp90. Further, we have shown conservation of the independent regulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 between Sti1p and its human homolog Hop1. Yeast Strain, Media, and Growth Conditions—Strain 1016 (Mat α kar1-1 SUQ5 ade2-1 his3Δ202 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3-52 SSA1-21 sti1::KanMX (14Jones G.W. Song Y. Chung S. Masison D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)) was used. Media with limiting adenine (∼10 mg/l) have enough adenine to allow ade2-1 cells to grow but not enough to repress the adenine biosynthetic pathway. In ade2-1 cells, a pigmented adenine precursor accumulates under these conditions because of a block in the pathway. 1/2 YPD (composed of 0.5% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) is a complex medium with a limiting but undefined amount of adenine. YPAD (excess adenine) is similar but contains 1% yeast extract and is supplemented with 400 mg/liter adenine. Synthetic media are described (15Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 194: 3-21Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 °C unless indicated otherwise. Plasmids—Plasmids pRS316STI1 and pRS315STI1 are single copy URA3- and LEU2-based vectors, respectively (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with STI1 and 500 bp of 5′ and 3′ flanking DNA inserted into the BamHI site. Plasmids pG/N795 and pUCΔSS-26X (17Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were used for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling assay (see below). Plasmids pYDL505 (UGG) and pYDL506 (UAA) (18Harger J.W. Dinman J.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were used for the translation read-through assay (see below). Mutagenesis—Plasmid pRS316STI1 was mutagenized by exposure to hydroxylamine for 1 h at 75 °C as described (19Schatz P.J. Solomon F. Botstein D. Genetics. 1988; 120: 681-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of pRS316STI1 using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, Burlingame, CA) and appropriate mismatched primers was done to construct Sti1-K75E. Sti1ΔDP2 was made similarly by introducing a stop codon at residue 538. Alleles encoding Sti1ΔTPR1, Sti1ΔDP1, and Sti1ΔTPR2 were generated by using the overlap extension PCR method for deletion mutagenesis (20Lee J. Lee H.J. Shin M.K. Ryu W.S. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 398-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of Sti1p Mutants—SSA1-21 sti1Δ [PSI+] cells were transformed by the mutagenized pRS316STI1, and 7,000 URA+ transformants were screened for defects in the ability to regulate Hsp70 as allowing growth without adenine at 30 °C and for defects in the ability to regulate Hsp90 as displaying hypersensitivity to radicicol (see “Results”). Nonsense Suppression (Stop Codon Read-through) Assays—A dual-luciferase assay system (18Harger J.W. Dinman J.D. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was used as described (14Jones G.W. Song Y. Chung S. Masison D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, early log phase cultures of cells expressing translational fusions of Renilla and firefly luciferase genes, with UGG (from pYDL505) or UAA (from pYDL506) at the sixth codon of the firefly gene, were assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega dual-luciferase assay system in a Zylux FB15 luminometer. Hormone Induction Assays—Assays were performed as described (21Riggs D.L. Roberts P.J. Chirillo S.C. Cheung-Flynn J. Prapapanich V. Ratajczak T. Gaber R. Picard D. Smith D.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, deoxycorticosterone (25 nm final) was added to early log phase cultures, and after 70 min samples were withdrawn for β-galactosidase assays. 100-μl samples were then added to 100 μl of the chemiluminescent β-galactosidase assay reagent Gal-Screen™ (Tropix, Bedford, MA) in 96-well microtiter plates at room temperature. The entire plate was read in a luminometer 1.5 h after the last sample was collected. Yeast Cell Extracts and Western Analysis—To prepare whole cell extracts, washed cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) and broken by agitation with silica beads in a Mini Bead Beater (Biospec Products). Samples containing 20 μg of protein were assayed by Western analysis. The Sti1p antibody used was generated in rabbits using a synthetic peptide corresponding to Sti1p residues 530-544 as antigen. Hsp70 (SPA-822) and Hsp90 (SPA-840) antibodies were from Stressgen, and Hsp104 antibody was a gift from John Glover (University of Toronto). Quantitative RT-PCR Assays—Quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed using standard methods as described (22Song Y. Azakami H. Shamima B. He J. Kato A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Identifying Sti1p Mutations That Alter Regulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90—The yeast [PSI+] prion is a self-replicating aggregated form of the translation release factor Sup35p (eRF3) (23Wickner R.B. Science. 1994; 264: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 24Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Kushnirov V.V. Dagkesamanskaya A.R. Poznyakovski A.I. Paushkin S.V. Nierras C.R. Cox B.S.

Biol. 2000; 130: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). [PSI+] propagates in the cytoplasm and is transmitted virtually infallibly between cells as they divide. Aggregation of Sup35p in [PSI+] cells decreases the ability of Sup35p to function in translation termination, which suppresses the ade2-1 nonsense allele in certain yeast strains (27Cox B.S. Heredity. 1965; 20: 505-521Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Nonsuppressed ade2-1 cells require adenine and appear red on limiting adenine because of the accumulation of an Ade2p substrate (see “Experimental Procedures”). Suppression of ade2-1 by [PSI+] confers growth without adenine and a normal white colony color. We showed earlier that a mutant Hsp70 (Ssa1-21p) impairs [PSI+] propagation, causing a pink coloration on limiting adenine and frequent mitotic loss of [PSI+], which is diagnosed as red [psi-] colonies. Unlike wild type cells, SSA1-21 [PSI+] cells also require adenine at 30 °C (28Jung G. Jones G. Wegrzyn R.D. Masison D.C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 559-570PubMed Google Scholar). Depleting the Hsp90 co-chaperone Sti1p in SSA1-21 cells restores a normal [PSI+] phenotype, so SSA1-21 sti1Δ [PSI+] cells are white and grow without adenine at 30 °C. Thus, impairment of [PSI+] by Ssa1-21p depends upon the ability of Sti1p to regulate Hsp70 (14Jones G.W. Song Y. Chung S. Masison D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We also showed that this ability of Sti1p to regulate Hsp70 with regard to [PSI+] is independent of Hsp90. Furthermore, SSA1-21 cells have normal sensitivity to the Hsp90-inhibiting drugs geldanamycin and radicicol, and deleting STI1 in wild type and SSA1-21 cells makes them similarly hypersensitive to growth inhibition caused by both drugs, indicating that Ssa1-21p does not affect the ability of Sti1p to regulate Hsp90. Therefore, SSA1-21 sti1Δ cells can be used to identify mutations in Sti1p that separately affect its ability to regulate Hsp70 and Hsp90. We used these cells to screen for such mutations. As expected, SSA1-21 sti1Δ [PSI+] cells transformed by the control plasmid carrying wild type Sti1p do not grow without adenine at 30 °C and have normal radicicol sensitivity, whereas those with the empty vector grow without adenine and are hypersensitive to radicicol. To identify Sti1p mutations, SSA1-21 sti1Δ [PSI+] cells were first transformed by a library of randomly mutagenized plasmids carrying STI1. Transformants that grew without adenine at 30 °C yet displayed normal radicicol sensitivity were selected as expressing Sti1p having impaired ability to regulate Hsp70 but retaining the ability to regulate Hsp90. Transformants hypersensitive to radicicol but remaining unable to grow without adenine at 30 °C were selected as expressing Sti1p having impaired ability to regulate Hsp90 but retaining the ability to regulate Hsp70. Many clones both required adenine at 30 °C and were hypersensitive to radicicol, and therefore they were defective for Sti1p regulation of both Hsp70 and Hsp90. Among these, we expected to find sti1 alleles with early termination codons. We also considered that single missense mutations might completely inactivate Sti1p, and therefore we sequenced 35 alleles that failed to complement Sti1p in both screens. All contained either early termination codons or multiple missense substitutions (data not shown), indicating that single missense mutations that disrupt Sti1p regulation of both Hsp70 and Hsp90, if they exist, are rare. We also constructed STI1 alleles lacking domains known to be important for specific interactions of Sti1p with Hsp70 and Hsp90 (6Chen S. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 13Carrigan P.E. Nelson G.M. Roberts P.J. Stoffer J. Riggs D.L. Smith D.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 8906-8911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Lastly, we assessed the abilities of human Hop1, a specific Hop1 mutant (K73E) known to be weakened in its interaction with human Hsp70 (13Carrigan P.E. Nelson G.M. Roberts P.J. Stoffer J. Riggs D.L. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16185-16193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the homologous Sti1p mutant (K75E), to complement Sti1p function in [PSI+] propagation. The STI1 deletion alleles and the locations of mutations identified in the screens are diagrammed in Fig. 1. Sti1p Mutations That Affect Regulation of Hsp70—The degree of red coloration of [PSI+] colonies and the frequency of appearance of red [psi-] colonies, which are readily observed on plates with limiting adenine, qualitatively reflect the degree to which Sti1p functions in the impairment of [PSI+]in SSA1-21 cells. Cells expressing Sti1ΔTPR1 and Sti1-C49Y were stably [PSI+] and lacked pigment accumulation (Fig. 2). These phenotypes are similar to that of cells lacking Sti1p (Fig. 2, sti1Δ), which shows that these alterations essentially abolished the ability of Sti1p to regulate Hsp70 with regard to [PSI+] propagation. Cells expressing Sti1p with the other substitutions in TPR1 (A31T, S44F, A63V, K75E, and G76N) displayed very faint pink coloration (Fig. 2). Thus, these mutations considerably impaired the ability of Sti1p to weaken [PSI+] propagation, showing that these residues also are important for Sti1p regulation of Hsp70. Together, these data show that TPR1, which is known to mediate the physical interaction of Sti1p with the C terminus of Hsp70 (11Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), is critical for the ability of Sti1p to regulate Ssa1-21p in a way that impairs [PSI+] propagation and reveal novel residues of Sti1p that are crucial for this regulation. To quantify the degree to which the mutations affected Sti1p function with regard to [PSI+], we measured the extent of read-through of a nonsense codon in a luciferase reporter transcript (Fig. 3). There was a general correlation between the overt [PSI+] phenotype and the degree to which [PSI+] was capable of causing nonsense suppression. It is readily apparent from the plot of the data that substitutions spanning TPR1, in particular between Ser44 and Ala63, most significantly reduced the ability of Sti1p to regulate Ssa1-21p with regard to [PSI+]. As anticipated, Sti1ΔTPR1 was phenotypically Sti1-null regarding its effects on [PSI+]. As the substitutions that were identified in the screen for defects in the ability of Sti1p to regulate Hsp90 were selected to retain the ability to regulate Hsp70, they predictably had modest if any effects on [PSI+]. Sti1p Mutations That Affect Regulation of Hsp90—Sti1p regulation of Hsp90 is reflected in the hypersensitivity of cells lacking Sti1p to growth inhibition by the small compound radicicol, which specifically inactivates Hsp90. The degree of sensitivity to such growth inhibition of cells expressing the Sti1p mutants in place of Sti1p is shown in Fig. 4. It is clear from these data that the C-terminal portion of Sti1p is critical for the ability of Sti1p to regulate Hsp90 with regard to its essential function. All of the mutations isolated as causing hypersensitivity to radicicol were in residues within TPR2a, TPR2b, and DP2 or were predicted to cause deletions of these regions by introducing premature termination codons. The TPR2b mutations provide the first in vivo evidence that Hsp90 is a ligand for this Sti1p domain. Also, cells expressing Sti1-Q564stop (Q564X) and the engineered Sti1ΔDP2 proteins remained completely hypersensitive to the lethal effects of radicicol, suggesting that an intact DP2 region is necessary for Sti1p regulation of Hsp90. In contrast, the Sti1ΔTPR1 and Sti1ΔDP1 proteins conferred nearly wild type sensitivity to radicicol, which indicates that TPR1 and DP1 are dispensable for Sti1p regulation of Hsp90 in this context. Effects of Sti1p Mutations on Steroid Hormone Signaling—We next tested the function of the Sti1p mutants in a process that requires simultaneous regulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by Sti1p. The folding pathway for Hsp90 client proteins in which Sti1p acts by coordinating Hsp70 and Hsp90 functions is highly conserved. Among client proteins in humans are steroid hormone receptors. Although yeast lack such receptors, a system consisting of hormone receptors and reporter genes in which expression is regulated by hormone-induced activation of the receptor has been developed for monitoring steroid hormone signaling in yeast (30Schena M. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1988; 241: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 31Schena M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Proper folding of the receptor, which allows it to bind ligand and activate expression of the reporter, requires its interaction with the Hsp70/Sti1p/Hsp90 machinery. This system has provided valuable insight into functions of these and other mammalian and yeast factors that are involved in this folding and signaling process (32Picard D. Khursheed B. Garabedian M.J. Fortin M.G. Lindquist S. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 33Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 34Duina A.A. Chang H.C. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We monitored Sti1p function in this client folding pathway by quantifying activity of β-galactosidase expressed from a promoter that is transcriptionally activated by glucocorticoid receptor after induction by exposure to the GR ligand deoxycorticosterone. Efficient expression of β-galactosidase in our strains was dependent upon both deoxycorticosterone and the presence of Sti1p, which demonstrates the requirement for Sti1p in GR folding and activation (Fig. 5A). The only Sti1p mutations that abolished function in this pathway were Sti1ΔTPR1, C49Y, Q159stop (Q159X), and Sti1ΔTPR2 (Fig. 5B). Thus, the simultaneous presence of unmodified TPR1 and TPR2 was necessary for GR activation. Although structural data suggest that Cys49 is not involved in contacting Hsp70 directly (11Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), it apparently is critical for Hsp70 interaction or regulation in GR activation. Sti1-Q159stop and Sti1ΔTPR2 both lack regions known to be required for binding to Hsp90. These results show that Sti1p regulation of both Hsp70 and Hsp90 is necessary for GR signaling in yeast and suggest that simultaneous interaction of Sti1p with Hsp70 and Hsp90 is required for GR activation. All of the other Sti1p mutations, except ΔDP1, caused substantial reduction in GR activation. Although Sti1ΔDP2 had only a modest effect on Hsp70 regulation as measured by its affects on [PSI+], it only slightly restored GR activation, suggesting that its defect in GR activation was related to its inability to complement Sti1p regarding Hsp90 regulation. The G403D and T526I mutations in TPR2b also reduced GR activation considerably, further showing the importance of TPR2b for Sti1p function, presumably through regulation of Hsp90 in this pathway. Overall, the degree to which the Sti1p mutations reduced GR activation correlated roughly with the degree to which they reduced the ability to regulate Hsp70 or Hsp90 independently, which suggests that the basis for Sti1p regulation of the individual and cooperative Hsp70 and Hsp90 functions is similar. GR Activation Requires Bridging of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by Sti1p—In addition to regulating the enzymatic activities of Hsp70 and Hsp90, Sti1p is thought to act in the Hsp90 client folding pathway by simultaneously binding the two chaperones to bridge them and facilitate transfer of substrate from Hsp70 to Hsp90. We used our system to test this hypothesis by simultaneously expressing Sti1ΔTPR1 and Sti1ΔTPR2 in SSA1-21 sti1Δ cells. As anticipated, although independent regulation of both Hsp70 and Hsp90 functions regarding [PSI+] and radicicol sensitivity were largely restored, GR activation was only marginally above background values (Fig. 6). These results indicate that although the truncated proteins were able to regulate Hsp70 and Hsp90 separately in the same cell, the client folding pathway depended on the physical linking of the two chaperones by intact Sti1p. Human Hop1 Regulates [PSI+] Propagation Like Sti1p—Others have shown that the loss of GR signaling in a yeast strain lacking Sti1p is restored by human Hop1 and that a mutation in Hop1 (K73E) that reduces Hop1 interaction with human Hsp70 reduces Hop1 function in this GR signaling (13Carrigan P.E. Nelson G.M. Roberts P.J. Stoffer J. Riggs D.L. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16185-16193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Carrigan P.E. Riggs D.L. Chinkers M. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8906-8911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, Hop1 and Sti1p are functionally conserved with regard to GR activation. We transformed SSA1-21 sti1Δ [PSI+] cells with plasmids containing intact Hop1, Hop1 with the K73E mutation, and Sti1p with the homologous mutation (K75E) to test the functional conservation between Hop1 and Sti1p with regard to [PSI+] propagation. Hop1 was capable of weakening the [PSI+] phenotype (Fig. 2, center right) and inhibiting [PSI+]-mediated nonsense suppression (Fig. 3) to levels similar to that of Sti1p, indicating that Hop1 functions like Sti1p with regard to [PSI+] propagation. Additionally, the K73E mutation reduced the ability of Hop1 to inhibit [PSI+], suggesting that these Hop1 effects on [PSI+] were mediated through regulation of Hsp70. The K75E mutation of Sti1p also reduced the ability of Sti1p to weaken [PSI+] (Figs. 2 and 3), and both Hop1-K73E and Sti1-K75E were impaired to a similar degree for GR signaling (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate functional conservation between Sti1p and Hop1 in both [PSI+] propagation and GR activation. Additionally, neither Hop1-K73E nor Sti1-K75E was altered in regulating sensitivity to radicicol compared with their wild type counterparts, which shows that the distinct regulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by Sti1p and Hop1 is evolutionarily conserved. Abundance of Sti1 and Heat Shock Proteins—To assess the possibility that effects caused by the mutations were due to altered protein production or stability, we used Western analysis to determine overall abundance of the Sti1 proteins (Fig. 7A). Except for Sti1-Q564stop (Q564X) and Sti1ΔDP1, which were elevated, the amount of the different Sti1 proteins did not vary significantly from that of wild type Sti1p, suggesting that the mutations reduced function of Sti1p rather than its abundance. Our Sti1p antibody recognizes an epitope spanning residues 530-544, which overlaps the border between TPR2b and DP2. Because this epitope is absent in the Sti1-Q159stop (Q159X), Sti1ΔTPR2, and Sti1ΔDP2 proteins, we used RT-PCR to quantify the relative abundance of STI1 mRNA as a measure of expression of these three proteins (Fig. 7B). Although the ΔTPR2 and ΔDP2 transcripts were as abundant as wild type, the amount of Q159stop mRNA was noticeably reduced, which was expected because transcripts with early nonsense mutations are targeted for degradation by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (35Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 307-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The abundance of the Q159stop protein could be expected to be reduced correspondingly, which probably contributed to its reduced ability to cause [PSI+] inhibition. It was also possible that the Sti1p mutations were exerting their effects by altering expression of Hsp70, Hsp90, or Hsp104. Hsp104 is essential for [PSI+] propagation and can interact with Sti1p under certain non-optimal growth conditions (36Abbas-Terki T. Donze O. Briand P.A. Picard D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7569-7575Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We therefore repeated the Western analysis to measure abundance of these chaperones. As shown in Fig. 7C, there were modest variations in steady-state abundance of the three chaperones in cells expressing the different Sti1 proteins, but the small relative differences were not likely to contribute significantly to the effects caused by the Sti1p mutations. Rather, the effects of the mutations are more likely due to disruptions in the ability of Sti1p to interact physically with the chaperones or to regulate their enzymatic activities. Although the role for Sti1p in coordinating action of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in the client protein folding pathway is well established, we now demonstrate that Sti1p can independently regulate the individual functions of Hsp70 and Hsp90. We also show that physical linking of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by Sti1p is required for efficient function of the client folding pathway. Our results delineate Sti1p domains that specify differences in Sti1p regulation of the two chaperones and identify novel amino acid residues that are critical for these Sti1p functions. We further identify Hsp90 as a ligand for TPR2b and provide evidence that the independent regulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 is evolutionarily conserved by showing complementary functions of the human Sti1p homolog Hop1. Previous in vitro data defines TPR1 and TPR2 as mediating Hop1/Sti1p interactions with Hsp70 and Hsp90, respectively (5Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lassle M. Blatch G.L. Kundra V. Takatori T. Zetter B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, we identified TPR1 as largely sufficient for Sti1p regulation of Hsp70 with regard to [PSI+] and TPR2 as essential for regulation of Hsp90. Moreover we show that TPR1 was dispensable for regulation of Hsp90 with regard to the essential function of Hsp90 and that TPR2 was dispensable for Sti1p regulation of Hsp70. Nevertheless, as both Hsp70 and Hsp90 are important for client protein folding, mutations affecting regulation of either chaperone predictably impaired steroid receptor activation, and we found that regulation of this activation required both TPR1 and TPR2 to be present on the same polypeptide. Although the ligand for TPR2b is unknown, others have found that point mutations in TPR2b of Hop1, selected by sequence alignment as in residues possibly involved in chaperone interactions, reduce Hop1 binding to Hsp70 but not to Hsp90 (13Carrigan P.E.

Although these data were stated to contrast with a report that deletions within TPR2b inhibit Hsp90 binding (5Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Carrigan P.E. Nelson G.M. Roberts P.J. Stoffer J. Riggs D.L. Smith D.F. J. Biol.

Unlike all of our Sti1p mutations, the Hop1 TPR2b substitutions did not affect Hop1 function in GR activation in yeast. Our mutations in TPR2b, identified in a screen of random Sti1p mutants, caused radicicol hypersensitivity and impaired GR activation without affecting [PSI+]. These physiological effects clearly reveal the importance of TPR2b for Hsp90 regulation and suggest that TPR2b does not influence Hsp70 activity directly. They also uncover limitations of in vitro interaction studies in predicting the effects of mutations in vivo. Aside from some of the effects of mutating DP2, our data agree with earlier reports showing that TPR1 and TPR2a of Hop1/Sti1p are important for physical interactions with Hsp70 and Hsp90, respectively, and that DP2 is more important than DP1 for steroid receptor activation (5Chen S.

The Sti1p mutant lacking DP2 was nonfunctional with regard to radicicol sensitivity but was affected only modestly with regard to [PSI+]. Thus, although DP2 played some role in Hsp70 regulation, it was more important for the regulation of Hsp90. Earlier work showing that point mutations in DP2 reduced both Hsp70 binding in vitro and GR activation in yeast led to the proposal that DP2 and TPR1 cooperate to bind Hsp70 (13Carrigan P.E. Nelson G.M. Roberts P.J. Stoffer J. Riggs D.L. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16185-16193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although our data do not rule out this possibility, they show that any loss of Hsp70 interaction that might be caused by truncation or complete deletion of DP2 has only small effects on Hsp70 regulation in vivo and that the major cause of the reduced GR activation by DP2 mutation might be the impaired ability of Hop1 to regulate Hsp90. It is possible that DP2 function either is affected differentially by deletion and substitution mutations or has diverged between Hop1 and Sti1p. Whatever the reason, the discrepancies between the two studies remain to be resolved experimentally. We earlier showed that Ssa1-21p impairs [PSI+] propagation through enhanced substrate binding because of increased ATP hydrolysis, which promotes substrate binding, or decreased ADP release, which stabilizes the substrate-bound state (14Jones G.W. Song Y. Chung S. Masison D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3928-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38Jones G.W. Masison D.C. Genetics. 2003; 163: 495-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As Sti1p is a potent activator of Ssa1 ATPase in vitro (7Wegele H. Haslbeck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25970-25976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), its depletion, which should reduce Ssa1-21p ATPase activity, has the expected effect of improving [PSI+]in SSA1-21 cells. Hop1 does not stimulate ATPase of Ssa1p in vitro, however, so its ability to restore inhibition of [PSI+] in SSA1-21 sti1Δ cells was somewhat surprising. Possibly, Hop1 does stimulate Ssa1p ATPase in vivo in a reaction that might involve other components of the chaperone machinery. Alternatively, the interaction of Ssa1p with the TPR1 domain of Hop1 is enough to confer regulation of Ssa1-21p in a way that influences [PSI+]. A possible explanation for such regulation would be that Hop1, which has a higher affinity for Ssa1p than Sti1p and preferentially binds the ADP-bound form of Hsp70 (7Wegele H. Haslbeck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25970-25976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), stabilizes this state of Ssa1-21p. There was a correlation between the extent of impairment of either Hsp70 or Hsp90 and the extent to which the client folding pathway, which depends on both chaperones, was affected. This observation holds even if regulation of one of the chaperones was essentially unaffected (TABLE ONE). These results suggest that the way Sti1p regulates Hsp70 and Hsp90 both independently and as cooperative chaperones is similar. Moreover, the ability to separate lethal effects of Hsp90-inhibiting compounds from effects on [PSI+] propagation suggests that the essential function of Hsp90 is unrelated to the ability of Sti1p to regulate Hsp70 and, therefore, is separate from the client folding pathway.TABLE ONESummary of effects of Sti1p mutations on Hsp70 and Hsp90 functionStilpCorresponding Hop 1 residuesAssayaSubjective values: +++, ≥90% of wild type Sti1p activity; ++, 75-90% Sti1p activity; +, 50-75% Sti1p activity; +/−, 20-50% Sti1p activity; −, <20% Sti1p activity.[PSI+] inhibition (70)Radicicolres (90)GR activity (70/90)None+++++++++Null−−−A31TA30+++++S44FS42+/−+++/−C49YA47−++−A63VG61+/−++++/−K75EK73+/−bImpairment of [PSI+] as measured by colony phenotype and nonsense suppression did not correlate.

Open table in a new tab Our inability to identify single missense mutations in Sti1p that impaired regulation of both Hsp70 and Hsp90 is consistent with our findings that the separate domains of Sti1p confer the ability to regulate Hsp70 and Hsp90, suggesting that at least two mutations might be required to eliminate the ability of Sti1p to regulate both chaperones. These observations suggest that Sti1p does not have a specific activity essential for regulation of both Hsp70 and Hsp90. Aside from bridging Hsp70 and Hsp90, Sti1/Hop1 can regulate enzymatic activities of these chaperones (9Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

The mechanisms underlying this regulation are not well understood, and it is possible that simply binding to the chaperones is enough for Sti1p to influence ATPase cycles or interactions of other regulatory factors. Further work with our novel mutants, in particular those altered in residues predicted to be outside of chaperone interaction surfaces, will aid in elucidating these regulatory mechanisms.

An important advance in understanding the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids alter the regulation of PEPCK-C gene transcription stems from the work of Granner and co-workers (13Imai E.

This region of the gene promoter extends from approximately –455 to –321 and contains three accessory protein binding domains (14Sugiyama T. Scott D.K. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. Mol.

Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) reported that the AF2 site in the PEPCK-C gene promoter preferably binds FOXO1 and only minimally HNF-3β. It has been proposed that C/EBPβ interacts at this site with other transcription factors as part of a nucleoprotein complex to regulate PEPCK-C gene transcription (24Ghosh A.K. Lacson R. Liu P.

Despite the key role played by the GRU in the control of PEPCK-C gene expression, there is evidence that it is not sufficient to entirely explain the effects of glucocorticoids on transcription of this gene. A segment of the PEPCK-C gene promoter from –540 to +73 bp was shown to be sufficient to confer full hepatic expression of a transgene in mice (25McGrane M.M. de Vente J. Jun J. Bloom J. Park E.

For example, in a fashion similar to the endogenous PEPCK-C gene, a transgene driven by a region of the gene promoter from –2000 to +73 is not expressed in the fetal liver (26Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnunson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Eisenberger C.L. Nechushtan H. Cohen H. Shani M.

Aran A. Cohen H. Eisenberger C.L. Reshef L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings are supported by results from transient transfection experiments using Hepa1c1c7 mouse hepatoma cells, which mimic the fetal liver. In these experiments the activity of a segment of the PEPCK-C gene promoter from –600 to +73 has a rate of transcription that is 5-fold higher than that of the counterpart 2000-bp gene promoter (28Cassuto H. Aran A. Cohen H. Eisenberger C.L. Reshef L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Finally, glucocorticoids failed to stimulate transcription from a 500-bp segment of the rat PEPCK-C gene promoter in HepG2 cells (29O'Brien R.M. Printz R.L. Halmi N. Tiesinga J.J. Granner D.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1264: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), although glucocorticoids were shown to induce the expression of the endogenous gene in these cells (30Sengupta S. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2367-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This suggested that the GRU extends upstream of the region that was described originally. This notion is further supported by the discovery of hypersensitive sites (HSS) in the rat PEPCK-C gene promoter (31Ip Y.T. Granner D.K. Chalkley R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A HSS locus was identified that is composed of two adjacent sub-sites, one of which mapped to positions –999 to –987; this coincides with PPAR binding domain in the PEPCK-C gene promoter (18Tontonoz P. Hu E. Devine J. Beale E.G. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 351-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second site was specific to PEPCK-C-expressing hepatoma cells and mapped to position –1400 (31Ip Y.T. Granner D.K. Chalkley R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Subsequently it was found in committed and differentiated adipocytes (32Williams C.P. Postic C. Robin D. Robin P. Parrinello J. Shelton K. Printz R.L. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Forest C. Chalkley R. Mol. Cell.

Acta. 1999; 1445: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the current study we have further characterized both sub-sites of the HSS B, at –993 and at –1400 of the PEPCK-C gene promoter and have found that together these sites take part in an extended GRU. This extended GRU is liver-specific and plays an important role in the regulation of PEPCK-C gene transcription by glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the presence of glucocorticoids interacts with non-steroid nuclear receptors, leading to a synergistic liver-specific stimulation of PEPCK-C gene expression, which requires all four accessory sites. This is supported by the demonstration that diabetic mice with a mutation in the dAF1 site in the extended GRU of the PEPCK-C gene promoter do not have the same level of blood glucose as mice with the intact gene promoter.

Animals—Transgenic mice were produced harboring the entire unmodified rat PEPCK-C gene flanked 5′ by 2000 bp upstream of the transcription start site and 3′ by 1600 bp. Mice with a targeted mutation in the PPARγ2 binding site of the PEPCK-C gene promoter (PPARE) were generated as described previously (34Olswang Y. Cohen H. Papo O. Cassuto H. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All mice were maintained on a commercial chow diet ((catalog #TK2018SC+F) purchased from Harlan Teklad (Madison, WI)) in the SPF (specific pathogen-free) unit of the animal facility at the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem. The mutant mice used in the present work were backcrossed into the C57Bl background (seven generations) to achieve a more homogenous genetic background of the population. Transgenic mice were genotyped by PCR, with rat PEPCK-C-specific primers to exon 9 (the 5′ primer; 5′-CTTGTCTACGAAGCTCTCAG) and to exon 10 (the 3′ primer; 5′-CGTCCGAACATCCACTC). One μg of DNA was added to the reaction mix (25-μl final volume) containing 125 ng of each primer, 10× commercial buffer (with Mg2+), 2.5 mm dNTP mix, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. After 33 cycles of amplification in a programmable thermal controller (MJ research), the PCR products were digested with the diagnostic restriction enzyme BglII, specific to a polymorphic site in the endogenous segment generating differential sized products that discriminated between the sizes of the endogenous gene and transgene by electrophoresis on 1.6% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and viewed with UV camera using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). PPARE mice were genotyped using the primers 5′-flanking region 5′-AGCCACTTCTTCTGTACC and 3′-GTAAGCTTTGTTCTGACAGG spanning the PPARE region in the PEPCK-C gene. The PCR product was digested with XhoI at the diagnostic recognition site to identify the mice carrying the mutant allele. Mice homozygous for the mutant allele are designated PPARE –/– mice. Diabetes was induced in adult male mice (2–7 months) by a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 μg/kg of body weight of streptozotocin. Blood glucose levels were tested using a glucose meter (Ascensia Elite, Bayer); after 3–5 days the animals with a blood glucose concentration of 400 mg/dl and higher were considered diabetic (35Friedman J.E. Yun J.S. Patel Y.M. McGrane M.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12952-12957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the diabetic mice used in this study were adrenalectomized 3 days after the injection of streptozotocin; they were provided with drinking water that contained 0.9% NaCl after the surgery and were sacrificed 3 days later. The procedures involving injections of streptozotocin or adrenalectomy were done under light anesthesia using 0.1 ml/10 g of body weight of 44 mm Avertin (containing 1.25% of tribromoethanol and 2.5% of tertiary amyl alcohol). Cell Culture, Transfection Conditions, and CAT Assays—HepG2 human hepatoma cells were grown in a medium containing a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 and 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 0.1 mg of streptomycin/ml. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure, essentially according to Chen and Okayama (36Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) with the slight modifications described previously (28Cassuto H. Aran A. Cohen H. Eisenberger C.L. Reshef L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) involving 3 μg of supercoiled plasmid and additional carrier pBlueScript DNA (Stratagene) for a total of 10 μg of DNA per 25-mm flask. Where indicated, 1 μg each of GR or HNF-4α expression vectors and 0.5 μg each of expression vectors for RXRα together with PPARα, RARα, or COUP-TF were added per flask. The precipitates were left on the cells for 5 h, after which the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and shocked for 3 min with 20% glycerol. The transfection efficiency was monitored by including 0.1 μg of plasmid pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene driven by the cytomegalovirus gene promoter as an internal standard and quantified by counting GFP-containing cells in a high field resolution of a fluorescent microscope. PEPCK-C gene promoter activity was determined by measuring the activity of the reporter gene product cat, as previously described (28Cassuto H. Aran A. Cohen H. Eisenberger C.L. Reshef L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 441-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone (10–7 m) was added to the cells no later than 20 h after transfection, when expression of the reporter gene was barely detectable. Cells were harvested 24 h after the addition of dexamethasone. The expression vectors included PPARα and RXRα (37Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) (from Dr. R. Evans), the rat GR (38Diamond M.L. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto K.R.

The generation of the plasmids containing the cat reporter gene driven by the rat PEPCK-C gene promoter, which included site-specific mutations, has been described previously (40Liu J. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. Biotechniques. 1990; 9: 738-741PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lechner P.S. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Millward C. Fekter C. Yun J.S. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

RNA Analysis—For the transgenic mice, total RNA from 40-h-fasted mice 10–18 weeks old was extracted using Ultraspec reagent (Biotecx laboratories, Houston). RT-PCR analysis was performed using random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences) with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of RNasin (Promega) to generate PEPCK-C cDNA. The cDNA was amplified using the same primers indicated above for the genotyping comprising sequences from exons nine and ten. The PCR protocol involved 20 amplification cycles only using radioactive [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). For PPARE mutant mice total RNA was extracted from the liver and kidney using the commercial Ultraspec kit, and Northern blot hybridization was done as previously described (34Olswang Y. Cohen H. Papo O. Cassuto H. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). New Plasmids Used in the Transfection Studies—The mutated dAF1 (PPARE) plasmid (dAF1-mut), derived from the pck-2000-CAT plasmid (41Lechner P.S. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Millward C. Fekter C. Yun J.S. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22675-22679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was generated by replacing the PPARE site with a synthetic fragment. Briefly, the segment encompassing positions –1445 (HincII) to –598 (HindIII) was amplified in two separate PCR reactions using primers containing altered nucleotides in the PPARE site. The PCR products were ligated using an artificial XbaI site, and the ligation product replaced the HincII-HindIII segment of the pck-2000-CAT. The first PCR amplification was performed using the 5′-primer CACGGTTGACACCCAACAGT (–1448 to –1431), which includes the HincII site, and a 3′-primer, ACGTCTAGAATACGTAGCGGCCGCTTGAACGAGCCGAGAGAAG, containing altered nucleotides (underlined), introducing an XbaI site and nucleotides from (–1044 to –1063). The second PCR amplification was done using the 5′-primer, GCCGTCTAGAGGTACGCTATTCGCCCGCTGCTCAAGTGTAGC, containing altered nucleotides (underlined), introducing an XbaI site and nucleotides from –986 to –970, and a 3′-primer, GGGTGATTGTAAGCTTCATTCCG (–606 to –584), which includes the HindIII site. This enabled us to replace the segment between –1031 and –987 harboring the PPARE site with 36 bp of random DNA. This plasmid was sequenced for verification. The mutated dAF2 site (dAF2-mut), also derived from the pck-2000-CAT plasmid, was generated by replacing the dAF2 site with a synthetic fragment. Briefly, the section between –1376 to –1345 that contained the dAF2 site was replaced with 33 bp of non-binding DNA, 5′-CGAAGCTTGACCGGCCGGATCCGCGCCCAGCGA. This replacement created two recognition sites for HindIII and BamHI, which were used for size verification of the restriction fragments. DNase I Footprinting Analysis and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear proteins were extracted from rat liver as described by Gorski et al. (42Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (43Trus M. Benvenisty N. Cohen H. Reshef L. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1990; 10: 2418-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The autoradiography density signals of specific bands in the exposed film were quantified using Fluor-S™ MultiImager with Multianalyst version 1.1 (Bio-Rad) as previously described (9Olswang Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 12929-12936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and specifically described in the legend to Fig. 2. The electrophoresis mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (7Cassuto H. Olswang Y. Heinemann S. Sabbagh K. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 318: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides of accessory factor 1 (AF1), distal AF1 (dAF1), accessory factor 2 (AF2), and distal AF2 (dAF2) were prepared by PCR using the corresponding primers; the AF1 site 5′ primer was CAGAGCTGAATTCCCTTC, and the 3′ primer was AGCTGTGAGGTGTCAC, generating a 55-bp fragment. The dAF1 site 5′ primer was GGTTCTTCACAACTGGG, and the 3′ primer was GGGCTACACTTGAGCAGCG generating a 46-bp fragment. The AF2 site 5′ primer was GGGAGTGACACCTCA, and the 3′ primer was GTGTGCCAGTGGCTGC, generating a 53-bp fragment. The dAF2 site 5′ primer was GACTTGAAGAGGAAGCCGC, and the 3′ primer was CTGGGGGTCCGTTGGAGC, which produced a 58-bp fragment. Radioactive labeling of the oligonucleotides was performed by including [32P]dCTP in the PCR reaction to a specific activity of 500 cpm/fmol using 15 fmol/assay. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Zivig-Miller rats (200 g body weight) were fasted overnight and sacrificed, and their livers were removed for the preparation of primary hepatocytes by the method of Berry and Friend (44Berry M.N.

Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The primary hepatocytes were allowed to attach to the plastic dish for several hours, and then the cells were treated overnight with 10–7 m dexamethasone and/or with 100 μm insulin for the last 2 h and again 5 min before fixation. The ChIP assay was performed as previously described (46Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The DNA isolated by immunoprecipitation was analyzed by PCR amplification using the same primers indicated above for the gel retardation assay for the AF2 and dAF2 accessory sites. The starting chromatin input fraction was diluted 1/1000 and analyzed by PCR simultaneously with the samples. The amplified DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis using 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide.

Cyclopentenone isoprostanes (IsoPs), highly reactive structural isomers of the bioactive cyclopentenone prostaglandins PGA2 and PGJ2, are formed non-enzymatically as products of oxidative stress in vivo. We have, for the first time, examined the effects of synthetic 15-A2- and 15-J2-IsoPs, two groups of endogenous cyclopentenone IsoPs, on the inflammatory response in RAW264.7 and primary murine macrophages. Cyclopentenone IsoPs potently inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IκBα degradation and subsequent NF-κB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 were also inhibited by cyclopentenone IsoPs as was nitrite and prostaglandin production (IC50 ∼ 360 and 210 nm, respectively). 15-J2-IsoPs potently activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) nuclear receptors, whereas 15-A2-IsoP did not, although the anti-inflammatory effects of both molecules were PPARγ-independent. Interestingly 15-A2-IsoPs induced oxidative stress in RAW cells that was blocked by the antioxidant 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (TEMPOL) or the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone. TEMPOL also abrogated the inhibitory effect of 15-A2-IsoPs on lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB activation, inducible nitricoxide synthase expression, and nitrite production, suggesting that 15-A2-IsoPs inhibit the NF-κB pathway at least partially via a redox-dependent mechanism. 15-J2-IsoP, but not 15-A2-IsoP, also potently induced RAW cell apoptosis again via a PPAR γ-independent mechanism.

In macrophages, the inflammatory response is largely controlled through regulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κ-B (NF-κB). NF-κB exists primarily in the cytosol as a p50/p65 heterodimer complexed with its inhibitor protein IκBα. Activation of the IκB kinase (IκK) complex by numerous stimuli, including exposure to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leads to the phosphorylation of IκBα, causing its dissociation from the NF-κB heterodimer and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Loss of IκBα reveals a nuclear localization sequence on the NF-κB heterodimer that allows its rapid translocation to the nucleus and facilitates transcription of proinflammatory proteins (7Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 8Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that can be either activated or inhibited by oxidative stress depending on cell type and circumstance (9Janssen-Heininger Y.M. Poynter M.E.

Excessive production of ROS leads to oxidation of membrane poly-unsaturated fatty acids, yielding a multitude of lipid peroxidation products. One such family of products is the isoprostanes (IsoPs), prostaglandin-like molecules produced by free radical-mediated peroxidation of arachidonic acid (11Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The measurement of IsoPs has emerged as arguably the most accurate and reliable index of oxidative stress in vivo (13Roberts II, L.J. Morrow J.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 808-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). IsoP levels are elevated in many tissues exposed to chronic inflammation, including postmortem brain samples from patients with Alzheimer disease (14Reich E.E. Markesbery W.R. Roberts II, L.J.

Halliwell B. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2001; 60: 627-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore injection of LPS into the mouse brain causes significant increases in IsoP levels, which can be abrogated by genetic deletion of the NF-κB p50 subunit or the NF-κB-responsive gene inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) (17Montine T.J.

Several classes of IsoPs containing distinct prostane ring configurations arise from a common endoperoxide radical intermediate following arachidonate oxidation (Fig. 1). Our group has previously described the formation of a class of IsoPs containing an electrophilic α,β-unsaturated cyclopentenone ring known as cyclopentenone or A2/J2 IsoPs (19Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These compounds react rapidly with thiol-containing molecules such as GSH and cellular proteins by Michael addition. We have also shown definitively that these compounds are formed in vivo and that their levels are elevated 22-fold under conditions of oxidative injury in rat liver (19Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The biological effects of cyclopentenone IsoPs, however, are essentially unexplored. Importantly A2/J2-IsoPs are isomeric to the cyclooxygenase-derived cyclopentenone prostaglandins (PGs), and two cyclopentenone IsoP isomers formed abundantly in vivo, 15-A2-IsoP and 15-J2-IsoP, are isomeric to PGA2 and PGJ2 (Fig. 1A), respectively, differing only in the cis orientation of their side chains with respect to the prostane ring, whereas PGs have trans configurations (20Chen Y. Zackert W.E. Roberts II, L.J. Morrow J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cyclopentenone PGs, along with the PGJ2 metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, have demonstrated a wide variety of potent biological actions, including anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and both cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects (21Straus D.S. Glass C.K. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 185-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory effects of cyclopentenone PGs are likely due to inhibition of NF-κB signaling through impairment of IκK activity (22Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M.

PGA2 has also been shown previously to inhibit iNOS transcription and NF-κB activation in a PPAR-independent manner in LPS-stimulated microglia (29Petrova T.V. Akama K.T. Van Eldik L.J. Proc. Natl.

Given the abundant formation of IsoPs during inflammation and the potent immunomodulatory effects of the structurally similar cyclopentenone PGs, we sought to evaluate the biological effects of cyclopentenone IsoPs in a model of inflammation. Importantly the stereochemical differences between IsoPs and PGs often leads to divergent biological effects (30Banerjee M. Kang K.H. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Newman J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H660-H663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); thus the bioactivity of A2-IsoPs cannot necessarily be inferred from that of PGA2. The recent synthesis of both 15-A2-IsoPs and 15-J2-IsoPs (31Zanoni G. Porta A. Vidari G. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 67: 4346-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Zanoni G. Porta A. Castronovo F. Vidari G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 6005-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) allowed us to examined the effects of cyclopentenone IsoPs on the inflammatory response in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells and primary murine macrophages for the first time. The biological action of cyclopentenone IsoPs on macrophages represents a novel interaction between oxidative stress and inflammation, two processes central to many disease states. Reagents—15-A2-IsoPs and 15-J2-IsoPs were obtained by total synthesis (31Zanoni G. Porta A. Vidari G. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 67: 4346-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Zanoni G. Porta A. Castronovo F. Vidari G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 6005-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and were each applied as a racemic mixture of four stereoisomers (see Fig. 1B). Cyclopentenone IsoPs were stored in ethyl acetate at -80 °C until immediately before an experiment at which time they were dried under nitrogen and resuspended in ethanol. IsoPs were added to culture medium immediately before its addition to cells, and because 15-A2-IsoPs rapidly react with albumin (19Chen Y. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10863-10868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), serum-free medium was used. LPS (from Salmonella Minnesota Re 595), 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (TEMPOL), N-acetylcysteine, and carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) were from Sigma. The PPARγ antagonists GW9662 and T0070907 were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Boc-aspartyl (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (BAF) was from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA). The NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Primary antibodies to IκBα, iNOS, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), p65, and actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and Hsc70 and ERK1/2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Cell Culture—RAW 267.4 murine macrophage cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and BV-2 murine microglial cells were a generous gift of Dr. Thomas Montine (University of Washington). Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and plated on 12-well plates or 100-mm tissue culture dishes 24 h before experimentation. No cells older than passage 10 were used as RAW cells showed highly variable responses at higher passage numbers. PC3 prostate carcinoma and LT234 colon carcinoma cells were from ATCC. Primary Bone Marrow Macrophages and Macrophage Cell Lines—Primary macrophages and macrophage cell lines were generated using bone marrow from mice expressing a luciferase construct driven by the NF-κB-dependent portion of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, long terminal repeat (33Yull F.E. Han W. Jansen E.D. Everhart M.B. Sadikot R.T. Christman J.W. Blackwell T.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Bone marrow cavities from femurs were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a 27-gauge needle. The cells were then pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and red blood cells were lysed in 1 ml of NH4Cl lysis solution (Sigma). After 5 min, 4 ml of PBS was added, and cells were pelleted as above and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Macrophages were cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine containing 10% L-medium for 4-5 days to obtain adherent, differentiated macrophages. Cell Treatment—Cells were rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM before treatment, and all treatments were carried out in serum-free DMEM containing penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were preincubated with IsoPs for 30 min prior to stimulation with LPS, and both IsoPs and LPS were present throughout the stimulation period in all experiments. Subsequently medium was removed and immediately stored at -80 °C. For experiments using inhibitors or antioxidants, cells were preincubated for 30 min with inhibitor and then for 30 min with inhibitor plus IsoPs prior to LPS addition. Appropriate vehicle controls (ethanol, 0.5%) were carried out in all cases. Measurement of Nitrite—Nitrite, a stable breakdown product of nitric oxide, was measured in cell medium using the Griess reaction. Briefly 100 μl of conditioned medium was mixed with 50 μl each of Griess reagent R1 and R2 (Cayman Chemical) in a 96-well plate, and absorbance was measured at 540 nm. Quantitation was achieved by comparison with sodium nitrite standards in DMEM. Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNFα) Quantification—TNFα levels were quantified in conditioned cell medium using a Quantikine mouse TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's instructions. MTT Assay—Cell viability was assessed by measuring MTT reduction (34Liu Y. Peterson D.A. Kimura H. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Following IsoP treatment, cells were rinsed and incubated in 0.5 mg/ml MTT reagent dissolved in DMEM for 2 h. Cells were then permeabilized by addition of acidified (0.1 n HCl) isopropanol, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm. Western Blotting—Total protein extract was prepared as described previously (35McLaughlin B. Pal S. Tran M.P. Parsons A.A. Barone F.C. Erhardt J.A. Aizenman E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3303-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal protein concentrations were separated using Criterion Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Membranes were then incubated overnight in primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Membranes were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated in Alexa 800-conjugated fluorescent secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized using an Odyssey infrared imaging system and software (version 1.2, LiCor Biosciences). Densitometry was performed using Scion Image software (version 4.0.2, Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). F2-Isoprostane Assay—Total F2-IsoPs were measured in combined medium and cell pellet as described previously (12Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were scraped directly into their conditioned medium and then collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of methanol containing 0.005% butylated hydroxytoluene, sonicated, and then subjected to chemical saponification using 15% KOH to hydrolyze bound F2-IsoPs. The conditioned medium was then added back to the cell lysate and adjusted to pH 3 followed by addition of 1 ng of 4H2-labeled 15-F2t-IsoP internal standard. Free F2-IsoPs were then purified by C18 and silica Sep-Pak extraction and thin layer chromatography and analyzed as pentafluorobenzyl ester, trimethylsilyl ether derivatives via gas chromatography, negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry. PPARγ Reporter Assay—PC3 cells were transiently transfected with 150 ng/ml of full-length PPARγ, 150 ng/ml of (PPRE)3-TK-luciferase, and 2 ng/ml pRL-SV40 plasmids using FuGENE 6 at a lipid:DNA ratio of 4:1. Transfections were performed in RMPI 1640 cell medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. After 4 h, cells were treated either 0.1% vehicle (Me2SO) or the indicated concentration of 15-J2-IsoP and 15-A2-IsoP. The PPARγ antagonist GW9662 (5 μm) was applied 2 h prior to IsoP exposure. After 24 h, cells were harvested in 1× luciferase lysis buffer. Relative light units from firefly luciferase activity were determined using a luminometer and normalized to the relative light units from Renilla luciferase using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). In separate experiments, LT234 cells were transiently co-transfected with 0.3 μg of USA-thymidine kinase-luciferase reporter and 0.4 μg of PPARγ (ligand binding domain)-GAL4 chimera and then treated with 15-A2-IsoPs for 16 h at which time luminescence was quantified as above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence staining, RAW cells were grown on glass coverslips. Following exposure to 15-A2-IsoPs or vehicle, cultures were fixed in 10% formaldehyde for 20 min, rinsed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked for 1 h with 8% bovine serum albumin diluted in PBS. Coverslips were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in rabbit anti-p65 (1:100) primary antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then washed in PBS for a total of 20 min and incubated in Cy-2-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h. Cells were then washed again and stained with 1.4 μm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min followed by further washes. Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides, and fluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope. NF-κB Reporter Assay—NF-κB transcriptional activity was assessed using a reporter plasmid containing the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat 36-base pair enhancer (containing a total of eight NF-κB binding sites) upstream of the herpes simplex virus minimal thymidine kinase promoter driving expression of a green fluorescent protein-luciferase fusion protein (fusion protein from Clontech). DNA was mixed with Superfect liposome reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in serum-free medium, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, supplemented with serum-containing medium, and then added to cells and incubated for 4 h. The DNA/liposome solution was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS. Serum-containing medium was then added to the cells and placed at 37 °C overnight. Experiments were performed the next day. Primary macrophages were obtained from transgenic mice expressing this construct and were not transfected. Following treatment, cells were scraped at select time points in Lysis Buffer (Promega). The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and 20 μl of the sample was used to perform a standard luciferase assay using a luminometer. Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was isolated from cells by TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol. Five micrograms of total RNA was fractionated with a MOPS-formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Hybond N1 membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Following UV cross-linking, the blots were prehybridized for 30 min at 42 °C in Hybrisol I (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY), hybridized using 32P-labeled cDNA in the same buffer at 42 °C, washed, and subjected to autoradiography. Briefly an 860-bp Northern blot probe for COX-2 (generously provided by Dr. Sanjoy Das, Vanderbilt University) was generated by restriction endonuclease digestion of an 1156-bp COX-2 cDNA fragment with EcoRI and PstI. IκBα Degradation and NF-κB Translocation and Transcriptional Activity Are Inhibited by 15-A2-IsoPs—To explore the effect of cyclopentenone IsoPs on the inflammatory response, we examined the effect of 15-A2-IsoPs on NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Following LPS exposure, translocation of NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers to the nucleus is required for NF-κB-mediated transcription and can be inhibited by cyclopentenone PGs (36Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of RAW cells with LPS induced a marked translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit into the nucleus. Application of 15-A2-IsoPs blocked this translocation. We quantified NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity using RAW cells transiently transfected with an NF-κB reporter plasmid. LPS stimulation of these cells induced a 3-fold increase in luciferase production after 6 h that was inhibited dose-dependently by co-application of 15-A2-IsoPs (Fig. 2B). The effects of cyclopentenone IsoPs on NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity were next examined in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages obtained from transgenic mice expressing an NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter construct. 15-A2-IsoPs inhibited NF-κB reporter activity dose-dependently in LPS-stimulated in these primary macrophages to a degree similar to that seen in RAW cells, demonstrating that these effects are not unique to RAW cells (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα is required for NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and can be blocked by cyclopentenone PGs (22Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 37Castrillo A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Hortelano S. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined by Western blot the degradation of IκBα in LPS-stimulated RAW cells treated with 15-A2-IsoPs. Stimulation of RAW cells with LPS led to a marked degradation of IκBα within 30 min, whereas co-treatment with 15-A2-IsoPs inhibited LPS-induced IκBα degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). Densitometry revealed that treatment with 15-A2-IsoPs actually stabilized IκBα to greater-than-control levels (Fig. 2C), suggesting that these molecules inhibit basal IκBα degradation. Thus, our results demonstrate that 15-A2-IsoPs inhibit IκBα degradation and subsequent NF-κB translocation and transcriptional activity. 15-A2-IsoPs Inhibit Nitrite Production and iNOS Induction in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 and Primary Macrophages—Activation of NF-κB drives transcription of a diverse array of NF-κB-responsive genes. In LPS-stimulated macrophages, iNOS and COX-2 are two proinflammatory gene products that are NF-κB-responsive (38Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 39Xie Q.W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the downstream effects of NF-κB inhibition by 15-A2-IsoPs, we assessed iNOS protein expression and activity (as determined by production of nitrite, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. In unstimulated cells, neither iNOS protein nor nitrite was detectable (data not shown). Stimulation of RAW cells with LPS alone led to marked expression of iNOS protein, an effect that was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by 15-A2-IsoPs (Fig. 3A). 15-A2-IsoP treatment also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of LPS-induced nitrite accumulation in cell medium with an IC50 of ∼360 nm (Fig. 3B). LPS-induced nitrite production was similarly inhibited by BAY 11-7082 (3 μm), a specific NF-κB inhibitor, suggesting that blockade of nitrite production is due to NF-κB inhibition (data not shown). 15-A2-IsoPs also inhibited LPS-induced nitrite production and expression of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (supplementary data). To determine whether the effects of 15-A2-IsoPs are shared by all A2/J2-IsoPs, we examined the effects of 15-J2-IsoPs on LPS-stimulated RAW cells. 15-J2-IsoPs inhibited nitrite production with potency similar to that of 15-A2-IsoPs (Fig. 3F), suggesting that these two compounds share similar biology. We also observed that 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), an abundant lipid peroxidation product also containing an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl capable of forming Michael adducts, inhibited nitrite production in LPS-stimulated RAW cells with slightly less potency then either 15-A2- or 15-J2-IsoPs (Fig. 3F). This observation is in keeping with previous reports that HNE can inhibit the NF-κB pathway (40Page S. Fischer C. Baumgartner B. Haas M. Kreusel U. Loidl G. Hayn M"
https://openalex.org/W2068242052,"Kainate receptors (KAR) are composed of several distinct subunits and splice variants, but the functional relevance of this diversity remains largely unclear. Here we show that two splice variants of the GluR6 subunit, GluR6a and GluR6b, which differ in their C-terminal domains, do not show distinct functional properties, but coassemble as heteromers in vitro and in vivo. Using a proteomic approach combining affinity purification and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, we found that GluR6a and GluR6b interact with two distinct subsets of cytosolic proteins mainly involved in Ca(2+) regulation of channel function and intracellular trafficking. Guided by these results, we provide evidence that the regulation of native KAR function by NMDA receptors depends on the heteromerization of GluR6a and GluR6b and interaction of calcineurin with GluR6b. Thus, GluR6a and GluR6b bring in close proximity two separate subsets of interacting proteins that contribute to the fine regulation of KAR trafficking and function."
https://openalex.org/W2065359879,"The interaction of salicylate with the respiratory chain of liver mitochondria generates hydrogen peroxide and, most probably, other reactive oxygen species, which in turn oxidize thiol groups and glutathione. This oxidative stress, confirmed by the prevention of action by antioxidant agents, leads to the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition in the presence of Ca2+. This phenomenon induces further increase of oxidative damage resulting in impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and β-oxidation, cardinal features of Reye's syndrome in the liver. Mitochondrial permeability transition induction also induces the release of cytochrome c and apoptotic inducing factor from mitochondria, suggesting that salicylate also behaves as a pro-apoptotic agent. The reactive group of salicylate for inducing oxidative stress is the hydroxyl group which, by interacting with a Fe-S cluster of mitochondrial Complex I, the so-called N-2(Fe-S) center, produces reactive oxygen species.

Salicylates and non-steroid drugs such as sodium salicylate, aspirin, and indomethacin, are widely prescribed for treating inflammation (1Weissmann G. Sci. Am. 1991; 264: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Their efficacy is, at least partially, attributed to their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase (2Vane J.R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7329) Google Scholar, 3Vane J.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In this regard, blockade of cyclooxygenase activity is believed to be linked to the chemopreventive effect of salicylates (4Taketo M.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1529-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 5Taketo M.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998 B; 90: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Data from other studies also indicate that cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors increase the susceptibility of cancer cells to apoptosis (6Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 363-366Google Scholar, 7Sawaoka H. Kawano S. Tsuji M. Gunawan E.S. Takei Y. Nagano K. Hori M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 273: G1061-G1067Google Scholar). Other reports propose the involvement of a cyclooxygenase-independent pathway during apoptosis signaling (8Hanif R. Pittas A. Feng Y. Koutsos M.I. Qiao L. StaianoCoico L. Shiff S.J. Rigas B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 9Rigas B. Shiff S.J. Med. Hypotheses. 2000; 54: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that aspirin induces activation of NF-κB, which is required for the antitumor effects of aspirin (10Stark L.A. Din F.V.N. Zwacka R.M. Dunlop M.G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is the general opinion, supported by a number of reports, that apoptosis is mediated by the phenomenon of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) 2The abbreviations used are: MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; AIF, apoptosis inducing factor; BKA, bongkrekic acid; CsA, cyclosporin A; Cyt c, cytochrome c; DTT, dithiothreitol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; RLM, rat liver mitochondria; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Δψ, membrane potential.2The abbreviations used are: MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; AIF, apoptosis inducing factor; BKA, bongkrekic acid; CsA, cyclosporin A; Cyt c, cytochrome c; DTT, dithiothreitol; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; RLM, rat liver mitochondria; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Δψ, membrane potential.

Pharmacol. 1997; 147: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Salicylates have damaging effects on isolated mitochondria, causing the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and swelling (13Segalman T.Y. Lee C.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Martens M.E. Lee C.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 2869-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Tonsgard J.H. Getz G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Aspirin and salicylate affect mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and act synergistically with the cation to impair mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis (16Martens M.E. Chang C.H. Lee C.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Tomoda T. Takeda K. Kurashige T. Enzan H. Miyahara M. Liver. 1994; 14: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Again, salicylates inhibit the Krebs cycle enzyme α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (18Nulton-Presson A.C. Szweda L.I. Sadek H.A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2004; 44: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Salicylates are in fact able to induce MPT in the presence of Ca2+ in isolated liver mitochondria (19Biban C. Tassani V. Toninello A. Siliprandi D. Siliprandi N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but also in “in situ” mitochondria of cultured hepatocytes (12Trost L.C. Lemasters J.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 147: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the onset of MPT by salicylate and Ca2+ represents the pathological mechanism causing mitochondrial injury in Reye's syndrome, a lethal disorder occurring in children, generally after a preliminary viral infection. Epidemiological and experimental evidence demonstrate a close correlation between Reye's syndrome and the use of aspirin (20Starko K.M. Ray C.G. Dominguez L.B. Stromberg W.L. Woodall D.F. Pediatrics. 1980; 66: 859-864PubMed Google Scholar, 21Waldman R.J. Hall W.N. McGee H. VanAmburg G. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1982; 247: 3089-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The main cause of this syndrome is most probably a primary mitochondrial injury. Brain and liver mitochondria exhibit morphologic alterations such as matrix swelling, decreased matrix density, and loss of cristae (22Partin J.C. Shubert W.K. Partin J.S. New Engl. J. Med. 1971; 285: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), typical of organelles which have undergone a permeability transition. A broad range of oxidant agents, thiol reagents, heavy metals, and uncouplers are able to trigger MPT in isolated mitochondria in the presence of supraphysiological Ca2+ concentrations (for reviews, see Refs. 23Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 24Zoratti M. Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive cyclic endecapeptide, cyclosporin A (CsA) specifically blocks the phenomenon (25Fournier N. Ducet G. Crevat A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 26Broekemeier K.M. Dempsey M.E. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7826-7830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is because of the opening of a pore, identified as a non-selective, highly conductive “megachannel” (24Zoratti M. Szabò I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Opening of the transition pore causes a series of events culminating in bioenergetic collapse and a redox catastrophe (11Kroemer G Dalla Porta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which salicylate induces MPT has not yet been elucidated, although some models have been proposed. Salicylate may bind directly to the pore-forming structure, promoting pore opening (12Trost L.C. Lemasters J.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 147: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the drug may intercalate into the mitochondrial membrane, altering its surface potential and thereby decreasing the gating potential of the pore (27Broekemeier K.M. Pfeiffer D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16440-16445Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Other authors have proposed that the induction of MPT in tumor cells is because of oxidative stress following the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), elicited by salicylate through a Rac1-NADPH oxidase-dependent pathway (28Chung Y.M. Bae Y.S. Lee S.Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Taking into account this capacity of salicylate to generate ROS at cytosol level, and recent observations that the interaction of the isoflavonoid genistein with the mitochondrial electron transport chain by means of its hydroxyl group in 4′-position, also generates ROS (29Salvi M. Brunati A.M. Clari G. Toninello A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), this study is aimed at determining whether salicylate, by interacting with respiratory complexes, can induce the oxidative stress responsible for MPT induction in isolated liver mitochondria. Another aim was to identify the specific component(s) of the respiratory chain that constitutes the target(s) of salicylate, to propose the reaction mechanism(s) of ROS production. Materials—Mouse monoclonal antibody anti-cytochrome c (Cyt c) was purchased from Pharmingen, rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was purchased from Chemicon International. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Mitochondrial Isolation and Standard Incubation Procedures—Rat liver mitochondria (RLM) were isolated by conventional differential centrifugation in a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EGTA (30Schneider W.C. Hogeboom G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1950; 183: 123-128Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar); EGTA was omitted from the final washing solution. Protein content was measured by the biuret method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (31Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria (1 mg protein/ml) were incubated in a water-jacketed cell at 20 °C. The standard medium contained 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm succinate, 50 μm Ca2+, and 1.25 μm rotenone. Variations and/or other additions are given with each experiment. Determination of Mitochondrial Functions—Membrane potential (Δψ) was calculated on the basis of movement of the lipid-soluble cation tetraphenylphosphonium through the inner membrane, measured using a tetraphenylphosphonium-specific electrode (32Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Katabake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial swelling was determined by measuring the apparent absorbance change of mitochondrial suspensions at 540 nm in a Kontron Uvikon model 922 spectrophotometer equipped with thermostatic control. Oxygen uptake was measured by a Clark electrode. This measurement allowed calculation of the rate of state 3 (ADP-stimulated) respiration (V3), the rate of state 4 (non-ADP-stimulated) respiration (V4), the respiratory control index (RCI = V3/V4) and the phosphate to oxygen ratio (ATP generated divided by oxygen consumed in state 3). ATP synthesis was measured by the enzymatic method of Lemasters and Hackenbrock (33Lemasters J.J. Hackenbrock C.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Adenine nucleotide efflux was monitored according to Ross et al. (34Ross I. Crompton M. Carafoli E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The redox state of endogenous pyridine nucleotides was followed fluorometrically in an Aminco-Bowman 4-8202 spectrofluorometer, with excitation at 354 nm and emission at 462 nm. Efflux of oxidized pyridine nucleotides was detected according to Carpenter and Kodicek (35Carpenter K.J. Kodicek E. J. Biochem. 1950; 46: 421-426Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The production of H2O2 in mitochondria was measured fluorometrically by the scopoletin method (37Loschen G. Azzi A. Flohè L. FEBS Lett. 1973; 33: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) in an Aminco-Bowman 4-8202 spectrofluorometer. It should be noted that the measured amount of H2O2 refers to that diffusing out of mitochondria, as the enzyme for its determination (horseradish peroxidase) cannot enter mitochondria. This measurement gives a qualitative indication but cannot be considered for rigorous quantitative evaluations. β-Oxidation of palmitoylcarnitine was assayed by the following procedure. RLM (1 mg/ml) were incubated for 10 min in standard medium, in the conditions indicated in the specific figure legend. Then 1-ml portions of the suspensions were withdrawn and centrifuged in an Eppendorf bench centrifuge (model 5415C) at 15,000 rpm. The supernatants were discarded, and mitochondrial pellets were resuspended with 30 μl of isolation medium. Subsequently RLM were incubated in the water-jacketed cell at 20 °C for oxygen uptake measurement. The assay medium contained 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm potassium-phosphate, 0.1 mm EGTA, bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml), 2.5 mm oxalacetate, 0.5 mm ADP, and 30 μm palmitoylcarnitine. The protein sulfhydryl oxidation assay was performed according to Santos et al. (36Santos A.C. Uyemura J.C.L. Lopes J.N. Bazon F.E. Mingatto C. Curti C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1455-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The oxidation of glutathione was performed as in Tietze (38Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5534) Google Scholar). The redox state of endogenous pyridine nucleotides was followed fluorometrically in an Aminco-Bowman 4-8202 spectrofluorometer with excitation at 354 nm and emission at 462 nm. Detection of Cyt c and AIF Release—Mitochondria (1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated for 15 min at 20 °C in standard medium with the appropriate additions. The reaction mixtures were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain mitochondrial pellets. The supernatant fractions were further spun at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to eliminate mitochondrial membrane fragments and concentrated five times by ultrafiltration through Centrikon 10 membranes (Amicon) at 4 °C. Aliquots of 10 μl of the concentrated supernatants were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE for Cyt c and 10% SDS-PAGE for AIF and analyzed by Western blotting using mouse anti-Cyt c antibody and rabbit anti-AIF antibody. The results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 summarize the well known effects of salicylate in inducing MPT, as also previously reported by other authors (e.g. Ref. 39Trost L.C. Lemasters J.J. Lemasters J.J. Nienimen A.L. Mitochondria in Pathogenesis. Plenum Press, New York2001: 425-450Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that energized RLM, incubated in medium in the presence of 50μm Ca2+ standard, when treated with 0.5 mm salicylate undergo extensive swelling, evidenced by a strong decrease in the apparent absorbance of the mitochondrial suspension. This colloid-osmotic alteration is accompanied by rapid and almost complete collapse of Δψ (Fig. 1B). Fig. 2 shows other events closely correlated with the above observed swelling and Δψ collapse. Fig. 2A shows that salicylate enhances O2 consumption with both succinate (a) andβ-hydroxybutyrate (b) as substrates. However, in the latter case, respiration is completely blocked after 7–8 min of incubation. The same panel also shows respiratory control index and phosphate to oxygen ratio calculations, obtained by succinate oxidation after 10 min of incubation, that is, in conditions of pore opening. Salicylate is also able to provoke the efflux of adenine nucleotides (Fig. 2B) and of oxidized pyridine nucleotides (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D shows the effect of salicylate-induced MPT on β-oxidation. This determination, like that of phosphorylation parameters, was performed during the opening of the transition pore. The results show palmitoylcarnitine oxidation is completely inhibited in the presence of salicylate.FIGURE 2Effect of salicylate on succinate and β-hydroxybutyrate oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation (A), adenine (B) and pyridine (C) nucleotide mitochondrial content, and palmitoylcarnitine oxidation (D).

Dashed lines in A, b, presence of 5 mm β-hydroxybutyrate as substrate instead of succinate plus rotenone.

Lemasters J.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 147: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Flower R.J. Moncada S. Vane J.R. Gillman A.G. Goodman L.S. Rall T.W. Murad F. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. Pergamon Press, New York1985: 674-715Google Scholar). All the observed events are completely prevented by cyclosporin A (CsA) and bongkrekic acid (BKA), typical inhibitors of MPT, confirming that the observed alterations are the results of pore opening (Figs. 1 and 2) (BKA was not used in the experiments shown in Fig. 2, A, B, and D, as it inhibits the translocase of adenine nucleotides). The reducing agent DTT, the alkylating NEM, and the antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene and Trolox also inhibit swelling and Δψ collapse (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that oxidative stress is involved in the phenomenon as inducer, amplifier, or both. However, although the results of Fig. 3 are indicative of the onset of oxidative stress, catalase and mannitol, well known scavengers of ROS, are ineffective in protecting RLM against MPT (results not reported). The inability of catalase, and most probably also of mannitol, may be consistent with the sidedness of ROS generation within mitochondria. In the absence of Ca2+, salicylate causes a considerable increase in mitochondrial oxygen uptake when compared with controls (Fig. 4). Ca2+, which alone has only a negligible effect, causes a further increase in oxygen uptake (Fig. 4). These observations, particularly notable in the absence of Ca2+, mean that salicylate, alone, can cause the generation of hydrogen peroxide or other ROS. Fig. 5A shows that the measurement of H2O2 production by mitochondria operating in a resting state (see controls in the absence or presence of Ca2+, ∼0.2 nmol/mg of protein), greatly increases up to 1.5 nmol/mg of protein in the presence of salicylate but in the absence of Ca2+. With Ca2+, the measurement of H2O2 generation by salicylate further increases to 2.2 nmol/of protein (Fig. 5B). CsA or BKA is ineffective in inducing inhibition when Ca2+ is absent (Fig. 5A); instead, in the presence of Ca2+, both the inhibitors reduce the level of H2O2 generation to the same value as in the absence of the cation (Fig. 5B). The real amounts of H2O2 generated by salicylate are most probably higher than those reported, because, as soon it is generated, H2O2 reacts with its targets and may also be transformed into other ROS (see also the description of the assay under “Experimental Procedures”). The production of hydrogen peroxide and, most probably of other ROS, explains the onset of oxidative stress, the effects of which are shown in Fig. 6. This figure shows that, without Ca2+, salicylate induces a drop of ∼40% in the total contents of reduced thiol groups and of 55% with the cation (Fig. 6A). However, Ca2+ alone induces a drop in reduced thiols of ∼15%. NEM almost completely prevents the oxidizing effect of salicylate.FIGURE 5Hydrogen peroxide generation by mitochondria induced by salicylate in absence (A) or presence (B) of Ca2+.

Incubation conditions and salicylate (SAL) concentration as in Fig. 1. When present, NEM was 10 μm. Mean values + S.D. of three experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Salicylate can also oxidize glutathione in the absence and presence of Ca2+ by ∼20 and 30%, respectively, whereas Ca2+ alone causes oxidation of 17–18% (Fig. 5B). Also in this case, NEM strongly inhibits glutathione oxidation in both conditions. Besides sulfhydryl groups and glutathione, another target of pro-oxidants agents in mitochondria are pyridine nucleotides. Fig. 7 shows that salicylate can induce strong pyridine nucleotide oxidation, but this effect is observable only in the presence of Ca2+; in its absence, no oxidation is observable, and Ca2+ alone is ineffective. NEM and DTT prevent oxidation. Oxidation of pyridine nucleotides probably occurs after pore opening, as they are not oxidized in the absence of Ca2+.Itis noteworthy that oxidized pyridine nucleotides are released from mitochondria (see Fig. 2C). This accounts for the results in Fig. 2D, in which palmitoylcarnitine oxidation is blocked in RLM undergoing MPT induction. It is generally agreed that MPT is the first step of the proapoptotic pathway. This characteristic is because of the release of soluble proapoptotic factors from mitochondria following massive swelling and consequent outer membrane rupture. Western blot analyses (Fig. 8) show that, in the presence of Ca2+, salicylate induces the efflux of Cyt c (Fig. 8A) and AIF (B) from RLM. In the absence of Ca2+, no efflux is observable. CsA and NEM are able to prevent both releases. Comparisons between the effects of salicylate and acetylsalicylate in inducing MPT are shown in Fig. 9 and highlight the greater efficacy of salicylate in causing mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 9). Instead, benzoate is completely ineffective. The reduced effect of acetylsalicylate with respect to salicylate and the complete inefficacy of benzoate were also observed when measuring thiol, glutathione, and pyridine nucleotide oxidation and in the release of proapoptotic factors (results not reported). As acetylsalicylate is known to hydrolyze to salicylate in the cellular environment, the reduced efficacy observed in the experiment of Fig. 9 is because of incomplete hydrolysis of acetylsalicylate by mitochondrial esterases. The complete inefficacy of benzoate means that the reactive center of salicylate is the hydroxyl group. For information about the site(s) of action of salicylate on the mitochondrial membrane, we considered the possibility of its interaction with some transition metal of the respiratory chain, in the oxidized state, using the same approach used for flavonoids (29Salvi M. Brunati A.M. Clari G. Toninello A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and triterpenoids (41Fiore C. Salvi M. Palermo M. Sinigaglia G. Armanini D. Toninello A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The basis of this strategy was to induce various redox levels in the respiratory complexes, to identify their involvement in the interaction. Fig. 10 shows that RLM incubated with salicylate in the presence of β-hydroxybutyrate as energizing substrate, which gives electrons to Complex I, exhibits considerable swelling (Fig. 10A), accompanied by rapid and complete Δψ collapse (B). The addition to the medium of the inhibitor rotenone, which blocks β-hydroxybutyrate oxidation, and succinate, which restores electron flux at the level of Complex II, produces almost complete inhibition of the mitochondrial swelling induced by salicylate (Fig. 10C), whereas Δψ undergoes only a slight transient drop (D). When RLM are energized with ascorbate plus trimethyl-para-phenylendiamine (which gives electrons to Cyt c) and are again incubated in the presence of β-hydroxybutyrate plus rotenone and succinate plus antimycin A (which maintain reduced Complexes II and III) (42Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the inhibition of swelling is slightly less marked than in the previous experiment and is accompanied by a small Δψ drop (results not reported). When β-hydroxybutyrate acts as an energizing substrate, the production of H2O2 by salicylate, determined in the absence of Ca2+, increases by ∼0.5 nmol/mg of protein when compared with that normally obtained when the substrate is succinate plus rotenone (Fig. 5A). Instead, the presence of β-hydroxybutyrate, when used as a reducing agent of Complex I, together with succinate plus rotenone, almost completely inhibits H2O2 generation (Fig. 11). The variable amounts of H2O2 produced by salicylate in the various experimental conditions shown in Fig. 11 exactly reflect its effect at the level of MPT induction shown in Fig. 10. In the presence of Ca2+, H2O2 production is increased when β-hydroxybutyrate is the energizing substrate (results not reported). The results reported here demonstrate that the well known induction of MPT by salicylate (see Figs. 1 and 2) is the result of oxidative stress triggered by the interaction of salicylate with the respiratory chain in the presence of Ca2+. The first indication of the involvement of such a process is given here by the results shown in Fig. 3, i.e. that several reducing, antioxidizing, or alkylating agents (DTT, butylhydroxytoluene, Trolox, NEM) can inhibit the induction of MPT by salicylate. The significant increase in oxygen uptake caused by salicylate in the absence of Ca (Fig. 4), correlated with the production of hydrogen peroxide in the same condition (Fig. 5A), is a clear demonstration of the pro-oxidant effect of salicylate. This action is further confirmed by the oxidation undergone by sulfhydryl groups and glutathione and the complete prevention exhibited by NEM (Fig. 6, A and B) when RLM are again subjected to salicylate in the absence of Ca2+. It should be noted that, in these conditions, although oxidative stress is established, the permeability transition is not triggered (Fig. 1, curves (SAL (-Ca2+)). The results reported in Fig. 5A showing that MPT inhibitors CsA and BKA do not induce any inhibition of H2O2 generation, unequivocally confirm that the observed oxidative stress is not because of pore opening. This phenomenon takes place only if Ca2+ is also present (Fig. 1). The increase in oxygen uptake (Fig. 4), H2O2 generation (Fig. 5B), and enhanced oxidation of thiol groups, glutathione (Fig. 6), and pyridine nucleotides (Fig. 7), observed in the presence of Ca2+, are the result of the opening of the transition pore. That is, with pore opening, the electrochemical gradient collapses, and the corresponding increase in electron flux along the respiratory chain to restore it results in an increase in oxygen uptake and, consequently, of ROS production by the chain. This is responsible for the increase in thiol and glutathione oxidation and oxidation of pyridine nucleotides. The maintenance of the reduced state, as controls shown by the presence of NEM (Figs. 6 and 7) and DTT (Fig. 7), is further confirmation of increased oxidative stress in the presence of Ca2+. The observation that in this condition CsA and BKA diminish H2O2 generation to the same level as that seen in the absence of Ca2+, that is, they block H2O2 generation because of the opening of the pore, further confirms that MPT is responsible only for enhanced oxidation of thiols and glutathione and oxidation and efflux of pyridine nucleotides. In conclusion, the sequence of the events is ROS production by salicylate, MPT induction by ROS, and further ROS production by pore opening. One proposable mechanism for pore opening is that H2O2, or other ROS produced by salicylate, act at the level of critical thiol groups (43McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) located on adenine nucleotide translocase. This is generally known to be the main protein involved, the oxidation of which forms dithiols, and is responsible for pore opening in the presence of Ca2+. The inefficacy in inhibiting MPT by catalase seems to demonstrate that H2O2 is not directly involved in the phenomenon. However, it must be noted that the enzyme cannot cross the membrane and that peroxide generation does not always rapidly diffuse out of the mitochondrion. Instead, glutathione oxidation (Fig. 6B), which demonstrates the involvement of the glutathione peroxidase/glutathione reductase system in the induction of the phenomenon, confirms that H2O2 is also an active agent (44Chernyak B.V. Bernardi P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 clearly demonstrates that oxidation of pyridine nucleotides may be considered as one effect of pore opening, rather than as a primary event for induction of the phenomenon, as no oxidation is observable in the absence of Ca2+. Ca2+ alone can also induce the oxidation of sulfhydryl groups and glutathione (Fig. 6), although without inducing MPT (Fig. 1). This effect is most probably because of the generation of hydrogen peroxide induced by the cation (see Fig. 5), like the results of its interaction with membrane cardiolipin. The change in membrane organization that follows this interaction may affect coenzyme Q mobility and favor ROS production (45Grijalba M.T. Vercesi A.E. Schreier S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13279-13287Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). But the critical thiol groups responsible for pore opening are very probably not oxidized in this condition. In considering MPT induction by salicylate as the result of oxidative stress, the generation of hydrogen peroxide probably follows the same pathway previously observed with the isoflavonoid genistein (29Salvi M. Brunati A.M. Clari G. Toninello A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 9 demonstrates that the reactive group of salicylate responsible for the observed effects is the hydroxyl group. As the reactive group of genistein and other flavonoids is also a hydroxyl group (41Fiore C. Salvi M. Palermo M. Sinigaglia G. Armanini D. Toninello A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 46Cao G. Sofic E. Prior R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar), the generation of hydrogen peroxide may be explained by the reaction sequence reported in works in which a transition metal in the oxidized form, Fe3+ or Cu2+, was involved in the first step (e.g. Ref. 46Cao G. Sofic E. Prior R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). Fig. 10 shows that the maximum extent of MPT induction by salicylate, evaluated as mitochondrial swelling (A) and Δψ collapse (B), is obtained when β-hydroxybutyrate is used as substrate, as the result of H2O2 generation. This effect is almost completely abolished by the addition of succinate plus rotenone (Fig. 10, C and D), which triggers the reduction of all the compounds of Complex I and prevents the production of H2O2 (Fig. 11). This indicates that the main and, most probably, the only target of salicylate is an Fe3+ of some Fe-S cluster of Complex I. That is, if some transition metal of all the other complexes were involved in the interaction with salicylate, the addition of succinate plus rotenone would not cause complete inhibition of MPT. Bearing in mind that the redox couple of the hydroxyl group of salicylate is of the ubiquinone/semiquinone type, the standard redox potential of which is about –60 mV (46Cao G. Sofic E. Prior R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar), one hypothesis is that the interacting Fe3+ belongs to the N-2 (Fe-S) center of Complex I, as it has a redox potential in the range of –20 to –160 mV (47Weiss H. Friedrich T. Hofhaus G. Preis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A control experiment with ascorbate as the energizing substrate, in which Complexes I, II, and III were in a completely reduced state (results not reported), only demonstrates the induction of MPT to a very low extent. This effect was most probably because of the presence of antimycin (48Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and may be considered negligible. As discussed above, the hypothesized target of the reactive group of salicylate is the N-2 center of Complex I. This indicates that the compounds which react by means of a redox couple of ubiquinone/semiquinone type interact with the respiratory chain at the level of the last part of Complex I or bc1 Complex. Genistein has also been proposed to interact with bH heme (28Chung Y.M. Bae Y.S. Lee S.Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 434-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and the cyclic triterpene, glycyrrhetinic acid, with the N-2 center (41Fiore C. Salvi M. Palermo M. Sinigaglia G. Armanini D. Toninello A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results reported here highlight important data regarding the interaction mechanism of salicylates with the mitochondrial membrane responsible for induction of MPT. One of the most important functions of salicylates is their well known anti-inflammatory and antioxidizing capacity, exhibited on a physiological level. Thus, the main result of this study, i.e. induction of MPT by oxidative stress, apparently seems to be a contradiction. However, it should be borne in mind that other drugs such as flavonoids (46Cao G. Sofic E. Prior R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar), isoflavonoids (29Salvi M. Brunati A.M. Clari G. Toninello A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), cyclic terpenoids (41Fiore C. Salvi M. Palermo M. Sinigaglia G. Armanini D. Toninello A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1658: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and cynnamil ketones (49Ligeret H. Barthelemy S. Zini R. Tillement J.P. Labidalle S. Morin D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which normally behave as ROS scavengers, in particular conditions may also exert pro-oxidizing activity, as observed with salicylate. This possibility is due, as mentioned above, to the characteristic of the reactive redox couple of these compounds to interact with particular transition metals of the respiratory chain. The close correlation between oxidative stress, MPT, and apoptosis, as also confirmed by the release of cytochrome c and AIF, inhibited by NEM and CsA (Fig. 8), indicates that salicylate is a pro-apoptotic agent and, in particular conditions, has an antineoplastic action. In this regard, it has been observed that salicylate is able to cause apoptosis in cultured hepatocytes (12Trost L.C. Lemasters J.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 147: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Indeed, aspirin and other non-steroid anti-inflammatory compounds exert their chemopreventive action against cancer by inducing apoptosis in transforming cells (50Shiff S.J. Rigas B. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1992-1998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the exhaustive study performed by Trost and Lemasters (39Trost L.C. Lemasters J.J. Lemasters J.J. Nienimen A.L. Mitochondria in Pathogenesis. Plenum Press, New York2001: 425-450Google Scholar) it was emphasized that a cardinal feature of Reye's syndrome is the formation of microvesicular steatosis. This is a typical pathological event in the liver, in which small fatty droplets accumulate in the hepatocytic cytosol without displacing the control nucleus. The above authors also point out that salicylate causes Reye's syndrome by inhibiting mitochondrial energy production and inducing mitochondrial damage. The results reported here, besides giving a general picture regarding the induction of MPT by salicylate and the mechanism of its action, may also provide further elucidations regarding the involvement of MPT in Reye's syndrome. The main goal of our study was to demonstrate that salicylate induces MPT by means of oxidative stress in the presence of Ca2+. However, it is noteworthy that the opening of the transition pore provokes further oxidative stress leading to increases in thiol and glutathione oxidation. Indeed, in this condition, pyridine nucleotides are also oxidized (Fig. 7) and released from the mitochondria (Fig. 2C). This finding accounts for the observed block of NAD-dependent substrate oxidation (Fig. 2A, b) and consequently the suppression of the citric acid cycle and gluconeogenesis, which are consistent with clinical pathology changes in Reye's syndrome (39Trost L.C. Lemasters J.J. Lemasters J.J. Nienimen A.L. Mitochondria in Pathogenesis. Plenum Press, New York2001: 425-450Google Scholar). The depletion of oxidized pyridine nucleotides also explains the complete inhibition of palmitoylcarnitine oxidation (Fig. 2D) and, more generally, the suppression of β-oxidation. As a consequence of this impairment, there is an increased cytoplasmic level of fatty acids, with the generation of microvesicular steatosis. Other metabolic alterations in Reye's syndrome are consistent with mitochondrial uncoupling and suppression of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation. These events are consistent with the observed effect of MPT in the complete lowering of respiratory control index and phosphate to oxygen ratio (Fig. 2A). As reported in the literature (39Trost L.C. Lemasters J.J. Lemasters J.J. Nienimen A.L. Mitochondria in Pathogenesis. Plenum Press, New York2001: 425-450Google Scholar) and also confirmed by the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2, CsA and some its analogs may be considered as potential therapeutic agents against Reye's syndrome. However, other compounds with antioxidizing properties and able to inhibit MPT induction, e.g. propargylamines and indolalkylamines, used in Parkinson disease (51De Marchi U. Pietrangeli P. Marcocci L. Mondovì B. Toninello A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1749-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 52Tetrud J.W. Langston J.W.

Monit. 2004; 10: 477-484Google Scholar), may also exert effective therapeutic action in the treatment of Reye's syndrome. Very recently the compound MitoQ has been proposed as a potent antioxidant, as its mitochondrial transport is driven by Δψ, and it concentrates into the matrix several hundred-folds (54Adlam J.J. Harrison J.C. James A.M. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. Sammut I.A. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1088-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). This characteristic overcomes the limited efficacy of conventional antioxidants, because of the fact that they are difficult to deliver to mitochondria in situ. The use of targeting antioxidants to mitochondria “in vivo” may be a new therapeutic strategy for Reye's syndrome, as well as for other diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2034314888,"N-Glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum is an essential protein modification and highly conserved in evolution from yeast to man. Here we identify and characterize two essential yeast proteins having homology to bacterial glycosyltransferases, designated Alg13p and Alg14p, as being required for the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol (Dol), the second step in the biosynthesis of the unique lipid-linked core oligosaccharide. Down-regulation of each gene led to a defect in protein N-glycosylation and an accumulation of GlcNAc1-PP-Dol in vivo as revealed by metabolic labeling with [3H]glucosamine. Microsomal membranes from cells repressed for ALG13 or ALG14, as well as detergent-solubilized extracts thereof, were unable to catalyze the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-GlcNAc to [14C]GlcNAc1-PP-Dol, but did not impair the formation of GlcNAc1-PP-Dol or GlcNAc-GPI. Immunoprecipitating Alg13p from solubilized extracts resulted in the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol but required Alg14p for activity, because an Alg13p immunoprecipitate obtained from cells in which ALG14 was down-regulated lacked this activity. In Western blot analysis it was demonstrated that Alg13p, for which no well defined transmembrane segment has been predicted, localizes both to the membrane and cytosol; the latter form, however, is enzymatically inactive. In contrast, Alg14p is exclusively membrane-bound. Repression of the ALG14 gene causes a depletion of Alg13p from the membrane. By affinity chromatography on IgG-Sepharose using Alg14-ZZ as bait, we demonstrate that Alg13-myc co-fractionates with Alg14-ZZ. The data suggest that Alg13p associates with Alg14p to a complex forming the active transferase catalyzing the biosynthesis of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol.

N-Linked oligosaccharide chains of eukaryotic glycoproteins are derived from the common core oligosaccharide precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, 2The abbreviations used are: Dol, dolichol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ORF, open reading frame; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LLO, lipid-linked oligosaccharide; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y. which is synthesized by an evolutionary highly conserved process in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Kornfeld R.

Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Subsequent to its synthesis the core glycan is transferred en bloc onto selected Asn-X-Ser/Thr acceptor sites of nascent polypeptide chains by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (5Silberstein S.

Synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide starts on the cytoplasmic side of the ER, where GlcNAc-1-phosphate is transferred from UDP-GlcNAc to Dol-P followed by the addition of one GlcNAc and five mannose residues from UDP-GlcNAc and GDP-Man, respectively. The resulting Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, thus generated, is translocated into the lumen of the ER (4Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys.

However a detailed enzymology and especially the regulation and coordination of their activities remain to be elucidated. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alg mutants (for asparagine-linked glycosylation) defective in lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) assembly have been isolated (25Huffaker T.C. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3203-3210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Huffaker T.C. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15582-15590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was extremely helpful in defining the pathway and isolating the corresponding genes. Similarly, different mutant cell lines from mouse lymphoma cells (29Chapman A. Fujimoto K. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4441-4446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Chinese hamster ovary cells have been described that produce truncated lipid-linked oligosaccharides (30Zeng Y. Lehrman M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 31Beck P.J. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Lehrman M.A. Somatic Cell Mol.

It seems that the individual substrate specificity of the glycosyltransferases ensures an ordered assembly of the oligosaccharide (33Burda P. Jakob C.A. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Aebi M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the second step in LLO synthesis, which is the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol from GlcNAc1-PP-Dol and UDP-GlcNAc, thus far no alg mutant has been isolated, and the corresponding gene has not been identified yet. We therefore searched for a potential GlcNAc-transferase in silico. While this study was in its final stage, circumstantial evidence was presented that two unknown open reading frames (ORFs), YGL047w and YBR070c, designated below as ALG13 and ALG14, respectively, are involved in this reaction step (34Chantret I. Dancourt J. Barbat A. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9236-9242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We extended these observations by establishing a specific assay to directly measure the enzyme activity. We have demonstrated that yeast membranes depleted of Alg13p or Alg14p lack GlcNAc-transferase activity in vitro and accumulate GlcNAc1-PP-Dol in vivo. Furthermore we have detected the proteins and shown that both are required for enzymatic activity, by acting in a protein complex. We found that an immunoprecipitate from detergent extracts of membranes of wild-type cells using Alg13p as target is able to catalyze the transfer of GlcNAc to GlcNAc1-PP-Dol, whereas the immunoprecipitate obtained from extracts of cells repressed for ALG14, or of a cytosolic form of Alg13p, is inactive. By affinity chromatography we show that Alg13 and Alg14 co-fractionate, indicative that the proteins form a complex. The following yeast strains were used: SS330 (MATαade2–101 ura3–52 his3Δ200 lys2–801), ALG13-tetOp (MATa ura3–52 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 GAL2 LEU2::tTA YGL047W(-50,-1)::loxP-KanMX-loxP-tetO7, Eurofan), and ALG14-tetOp (YSC1180, Open Biosystems). Cells were grown at 30 °C in standard yeast media, either YEPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 2% dextrose) or YNBD drop-out medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% dextrose). For repression experiments, tetracycline was added to an early log culture (4 × 104 cells/ml) in a concentration of 300 μg/ml and further cultivated for the times indicated. To construct the expression plasmids pVT100-Alg13-ZZ and pVT100-Alg14-ZZ, both ORFs with engineered HindIII and BamHI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, for cloning purpose were amplified by PCR and ligated into the HindIII/BamHI cut pVT100-ZZ vector under the control of the ADH1 promotor. The constructs were sequenced, and the expression of the genes containing two protein A epitopes (ZZ) in-frame at the C terminus was verified by immunoblotting. For PCR amplification the following primers were used: Alg13 forward (5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGATGGGTATTATTG-3′), Alg13 reverse (5′-CGGGATCCGCTGTATATAGTTTAACTAGCAATC-3′), Alg14 forward (5′-CCCAAGCTTAT GAAAACGGCCTACTTGGCGTCATTGGTG-3′), Alg14 reverse (5′CGCGGATCCAACAAGGATGCCGAACCACTTGGATCTTGGT-3′). To generate C-terminal ZZ (protein A) and myc fusions, respectively, of ALG13 at the chromosomal locus, an integrative cassette, containing either the ZZ epitope or the myc epitope and kanMX4 as the selection marker, was created by PCR on template DNA pZZ-kanMX or pMyc-kanMX. The correct integration was confirmed by PCR amplification. ALG13-Kan forward (5′-CCCAGT TTCTCATAACCCGTCATTTGAGCGATTGCTAGTTGAAACTATATACAGCGGAGCAGGGGCGGGTGC-3′), ALG13-Kan reverse (5′-GATCAAAAACGTCTAAGGCATTACG CGGATACTGCTAACTAACCAAAGAAACCTTCCAGGTCGACGGTATCG-3′). Transformation into yeast and Escherichia coli was carried out using standard techniques. Labeling with [2-3H]mannose (15 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and analysis of oligosaccharides by HPLC was performed as described previously (35Knauer R. Lehle L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17249-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For labeling of lipid-linked saccharides with glucosamine, 4 × 108 cells were incubated with 100 μCi of [6-3H]glucosamine (33 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in YEP medium for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol 3:2 (v/v) and processed by Folch partitioning (36Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The washed glycolipid extract was separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60-coated plates (Merck), developed in chloroform/methanol/water 65:25:4 (v/v/v). Radioactivity was monitored with a TLC radioanalyzer (Berthold). Rough microsomal membranes were isolated as described (37Knauer R. Lehle L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The membranes were resuspended in 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 35% glycerol (v/v) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml protein. For solubilization, membranes were diluted to 6.5 mg/ml with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 3 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1.5%. After 20 min incubation on ice the solubilized extract was separated from insoluble material by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 40 min. Unless otherwise stated, all steps were carried out at 4 °C. Assay I—To measure the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to endogenous lipid acceptors in microsomal membranes, the reaction contained 7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05 μCi of UDP-GlcNAc (227 μCi/mmol), 13 mm MgCl2, and a 60 μl membrane fraction in a final volume of 75 μl. After 15 min at 24 °C the reaction was stopped with chloroform/methanol 3:2 (v/v). Labeled lipids were extracted and washed as described (11Sharma C.B. Lehle L. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and separated by TLC. Assay II—GlcNAc-transferase activity in solubilized extracts was determined with GlcNAc1-PP-Dol as acceptor and UDP-GlcNAc as donor. The reaction contained the following in a final volume of 0.06 ml: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, [14C]GlcNAc1-PP-Dol (3000 cpm), 0.1 mm UDP-GlcNAc, and solubilized enzyme (equivalent to 30 μg of membrane protein). After incubation at 24 °C for the times indicated, GlcNAc1/2-PP-Dol was extracted and analyzed by TLC as described above. Radioactivity was detected by phosphorimaging or x-ray film. Assay III—Determination of enzyme activity by immunoprecipitation of Alg13-ZZ or Alg14-ZZ was carried out as follows. 0.2 ml of solubilized extract was incubated on ice for 30 min with 0.05 ml of IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) by gentle tumbling. IgG-Sepharose 6 was equilibrated before use with 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2 150 mm NaCl, and 17.5% glycerol. The affinity matrix was centrifuged and washed three times with 0.2 ml of 1.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm MgCl2, and 17.5% glycerol. The pellet was resuspended in a 40-μl assay mixture: 17 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 13 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 26% glycerol, 0.08% Nonidet P-40, [14C]GlcNAc1-PP-Dol (3000 cpm), and 0.1 mm UDP-GlcNAc. The reaction was incubated at 24 °C, stopped with chloroform/methanol (3:2) after the times indicated, and processed as for assay II. Solubilized enzyme extract was prepared as described above and subjected to a IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (0.5 ml) chromatography, prepared according to the manufacturer, and equilibrated in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 17.5% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. 0.5 ml solubilized extract was loaded, and the column was washed with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer to remove unbound material. Elution was carried out with 100 mm glycine-HCl buffer, pH 3.3, and fractions of 0.3 ml were collected and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against the ZZ (for Alg14p) or myc (for Alg13p) epitopes. Identification in Silico of the Yeast ORFs YGL047w and YBR070c as Potential GlcNAc-transferases—Early steps in biosynthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide are essential for the viability of yeast. To identify candidate genes encoding the not yet identified GlcNAc-transferase, catalyzing the transfer of the second GlcNAc residue in LLO biosynthesis to give rise to GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, the S. cerevisiae data base was searched for essential genes with a potential glycosyltransferase motif. The survey revealed the unknown ORF YGL047w as a protein annotated to the glycosyltransferase family 28 C-terminal domain (pfam04101). Because of structural analysis this domain has been suggested to be involved in UDP-GlcNAc binding. We reasoned that this gene might be a potential candidate for the not yet identified GlcNAc-transferase. Ygl047p also shares homology with the C-terminal half of the E. coli MurG enzyme, which belongs to the glycosyltransferase family 28 as well, and catalyzes the transfer of the GlcNAc residue from UDP-GlcNAc to lipid-linked N-aycetylmuramoyl pentapeptide, an intermediate of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The YGL047w gene codes for a predicted protein of 22.6 kDa that seems to have no signal sequence and only a weak candidate membrane-spanning segment. We also realized that in a genome-wide protein-protein interaction project (Yeast Resource Center, Seattle, WA) the essential Ybr070c protein was detected among other proteins as a potential candidate interacting with Ygl047p. Interestingly Ybr070p has homology to the Cps14f gene product involved in the formation of capsular polysaccharide of Streptococcus pneumoniae. cps14f was reported to stimulate cps14g encoding the β-1,4-galactosyltransferase. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the galactose unit, the second sugar moiety of the capsular polysaccharide (38Kolkman M.A. van der Zeijst B.A. Nuijten P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19502-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, cps14f has homology to the N-terminal half of murG. Therefore we reasoned that Ybr070p may also be involved in the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. In contrast to Ygl047p, the amino acid sequence of Ybr070p predicts a protein with an N-terminal signal peptide and one to three trans-membrane segments. As we have demonstrated (see below) that these two proteins are indeed involved in the GlcNAc transfer onto GlcNAc1-PP-Dol, we designated the YGL047w locus as ALG13 and the YBR070c locus as ALG14. To extend our understanding of how Alg13 and Alg14 proteins may be organized, we used the two amino acid sequences to search protein data bases for homologous proteins using the PHI (pattern-hit initiated) BLAST algorithm (39Zhang Z. Schaffer A.A. Miller W. Madden T.L. Lipman D.J. Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3986-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We found Alg13 and Alg14 homologous proteins in virtually all eukaryotic cells including yeast, man, mammals, insects, worms, and plants. In general, Alg13 or Alg14 proteins are shorter than members of the bacterial MurG proteins. In almost all cases the Alg13p and Alg14p homologs encode separate polypeptides. An exception is the Entamoeba histolytica sequence, encoding a protein of 345 amino acids in length, that clearly contains both an Alg13 and an Alg14 protein domain. The domains are fused to each other but in an inverse order as compared with bacterial MurG proteins (Fig. 1). Repression of ALG13 and ALG14 Causes a Defect in N-Glycosylation and Accumulation of GlcNAc1-PP-Dol—To analyze the function of ALG13 and ALG14 genes in N-glycosylation, we examined the glycosylation pattern of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a well characterized glycoprotein, in strains in which chromosomal ALG13 and ALG14 are under the control of the tetracycline-regulated tetO7 promoter (40Belli G. Gari E. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The addition of tetracycline, which causes repression of the respective gene, led to an under-glycosylation of CPY in both strains (Fig. 2). Mature CPY contains four N-linked glycan chains, whereas a glycosylation defect gives rise to CPY species lacking one or more chains and thus migrating faster on SDS-gels. Under-glycosylation could be caused by a reduced transfer of truncated, non-optimal oligosaccharides, a reduced pool of full-length core oligosaccharides, or a defect in the glycan transfer onto the nascent polypeptide chain. We therefore investigated the formation of LLO by metabolic labeling of yeast cells with [3H]mannose and [3H]glucosamine, respectively, under conditions in which ALG13 was expressed or turned off by tetracycline. Fig. 3A shows the mannose-labeled LLO fraction after release of the glycan moieties by mild acid and subsequent size fractionation of the oligosaccharides by HPLC. In the presence or absence of tetracycline, the whole spectrum of LLOs was visible up to the full-length glucose-containing core, but a dramatic decrease in the total amount occurred upon down-regulation of Alg13p (Fig. 3A, traces A and B). We reasoned that a defect in the initiating steps of LLO biosynthesis might be the cause of this decrease. To verify this interpretation, we labeled cells with [3H]glucosamine and analyzed by TLC the chloroform/methanol (3:2) extract containing the more hydrophobic dolichol-linked saccharides with short sugar chains (Fig. 3B). Upon down-regulation of ALG13 a radioactive peak accumulated that comigrated with GlcNAc1-PP-Dol at the expense of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (Fig. 3B, traces A and B). The minor, shorter migrating peaks than GlcNAc2-PP-Dol are supposed to be Man1–2GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. These results indicate that Alg13p is required for the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, and the longer LLOs during mannose labeling, under conditions in which ALG13 is turned off (Fig. 3A, trace B), are the result of residual Alg13p (see also below). Essentially similar results were obtained, when a tetO7-ALG14 strain was labeled with either [3H]mannose (Fig. 3A, traces C and D) or [3H]glucosamine (Fig. 3B, traces C and D) in the absence or presence of tetracycline. In Vitro Assay of UDP-GlcNAc: GlcNAc1-PP-Dol GlcNAc-transferase in Microsomal Membranes and Detergent-solubilized Extracts—The above results indicate that both Alg13p and Alg14p are involved in the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol. Therefore we tried to prove this more directly by measuring this enzymatic reaction in vitro. Microsomal membranes were prepared from cells expressing ALG13 and ALG14, respectively, or from cells in which the genes had been”turned off.“As shown in Fig. 4, membranes from cells depleted of Alg13p or Alg14p were still able to form GlcNAc1-PP-Dol and also GPI-linked GlcNAc when incubated with UDP-[14C]GlcNAc, but the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol was abolished. This finding was in clear contrast to incubations in which microsomes were used that were prepared from cells expressing ALG13 or ALG14 genes. To further this, we established an assay to measure specifically the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, instead of using the endogenous lipid acceptors of the membrane. Detergent-solubilized extracts were incubated with [14C]GlcNAc1-PP-Dol as acceptor and unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc as donor, and the formation of [14C]GlcNAc2-PP-Dol was followed. As shown in Fig. 5, the extension of GlcNAc1-PP-Dol occurred only with extracts from membranes expressing Alg13p (panel A) and Alg14p (panel B) but not in extracts from membranes depleted for these proteins by the addition of tetracycline.FIGURE 5GlcNAc-transferase activity with solubilized enzyme.

We used this epitope to immunoprecipitate Alg13-ZZp and Alg14-ZZp from solubilized extracts from wild-type cells with IgG-Sepharose and to measure the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol in the immunoprecipitate. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 6 [14C]GlcNAc1-PP-Dol was almost completely converted to [14C]GlcNAc2-PP-Dol (lane 1) during a 25-min incubation. No elongation was measurable in a control experiment in which Sepharose without covalently linked IgG was used as the affinity matrix for precipitation (Fig. 6, lane 2; the asterisk indicates a small contamination of Dol-PP-GlcNAc2 in the synthesized substrate). In contrast, an immunoprecipitate of Alg14-ZZp solubilized from wild-type membranes under the same conditions was enzymatically inactive (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4). We also determined the GlcNAc-transferase activity in an Alg13-ZZp immunoprecipitate from a tetO7-ALG14 strain expressing ALG14 (Fig. 6, lane 5) or after ALG14 has been shut off (lane 6). We observed that Alg13-ZZp was no longer active under the latter conditions. This could be because Alg13p needs Alg14p for activity or/and because Alg13p is depleted when ALG14 is repressed (see also below). Localization of Alg13p to the Membrane Is Dependent on ALG14—As mentioned above, Alg13p, in contrast to Alg14p, does not have a pronounced predicted membrane spanning domain. During the analysis of expression of these proteins we realized that Alg13p localizes both to the membrane and to the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 7B). By quantitative Western blot analysis we calculated that slightly more than 50% of Alg13p was in a soluble form in the cytosol. In contrast, Alg14p was exclusively associated with the membrane fraction. As a control, another glycosyltransferase of the LLO pathway, the Alg3-mannosyl-transferase, catalyzing the formation of Man6GlcNAc2-PP-Dol from Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, is shown. This enzyme is exclusively membrane-bound as well. Next we asked whether the cytosolic Alg13p is enzymatically active as well. As depicted in Fig. 7A, an immunoprecipitate of cytosolic Alg13p was not able to catalyze the formation of [14C]GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, compared with the Alg13p form solubilized from microsomal membranes. In Fig. 7C it is shown that localization of Alg13p to the membrane is dependent on expression of ALG14. By Western blot analysis we observed that down-regulation of ALG14 by tetracycline in a tetO7-ALG14 strain, harboring a chromosomal ALG13-ZZ-tagged variant, Alg13p, decreased in the microsomal membrane fraction in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, as a control, the amount of membrane-bound Wbp1p, a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase, did not change. But as expected, an under-glycosylation of Wbp1p occurs as a consequence of the glycosylation defect and is reflected by a faster mobility on the SDS-gel. Wbp1p contains two N-linked glycan chains. Furthermore, we investigated the level of membrane-bound Alg13p in comparison with the GlcNAc-transferase activity in the tetO7-ALG13 strain expressing chromosomal ALG13-ZZ. Membranes were isolated from cells repressed by tetracycline at the times indicated, and Alg13p was quantified in Western blots. The GlcNAc-transferase activity was determined in solubilized extracts with [14C]GlcNAc1-PP-Dol as acceptor and UDP-GlcNAc as donor. As depicted in Fig. 8 the protein level and the enzyme activity decrease in a similar manner when ALG13 expression is turned off. Physical Interaction between Alg13p and Alg14p—The results obtained thus far suggest that both proteins may interact physically to form the active enzyme. To demonstrate such an interaction, we constructed a yeast strain co-expressing an ALG14-ZZ and an ALG13 myc-tagged variant. A detergent-solubilized extract was isolated from microsomal membranes of this strain and applied to an IgG-Sepharose column that recognizes the ZZ epitope, and the eluate was analyzed by Western blot analysis for Alg14p and Alg13p. As shown in Fig. 9, A and B, both proteins co-fractionated. In contrast, when the solubilized extract was chromatographed on Sepharose material without IgG coupling, neither Alg14p-ZZ nor Alg13p-myc was detectable (Fig. 9, C and D). This indicates that both proteins associate in a complex and that the binding to the affinity matrix is specific. The somewhat earlier elution of the more hydrophilic Alg13p may indicate that the interaction is prone to some dissociation. In this article we have identified and characterized two essential genes, ALG13 and ALG14, necessary for the formation of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol both in vitro and in vivo. The participation of two genes in a reaction of lipid-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis is novel and was unexpected, because in yeast all other glycosyltransferases of this pathway known so far are catalyzed by only a single polypeptide. We show that down-regulation of each gene causes hypoglycosylation of glycoproteins (CPY and Wbp1), accumulation of GlcNAc1-PP-Dol during metabolic labeling with [3H]glucosamine, and a defect in the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc onto GlcNAc1-PP-Dol in membranes as well as in solubilized extracts. Alg13p and Alg14p, identified in this work, are evolutionarily conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells and also have a similarity to domains of glycosyltransferase involved in bacterial cell wall glycoconjugate and polysaccharide biosynthesis, respectively (41Mengin-Lecreulx D. Texier L. Rousseau M. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4625-4636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Kolkman M.A. Wakarchuk W. Nuijten P.J. van der Zeijst B.A. Mol.

For most eukaryotes, the Alg13 and Alg14 proteins are translated from two individual loci found in the genome, the ALG13 and the ALG14 loci, respectively. Interestingly, in the E. histolytica we found only one gene encoding a protein that clearly contained the Alg13 and Alg14 (Fig. 1) domains. Sequence analysis of Alg13p revealed that it maps to the C-terminal region of the MurG GlcNAc-transferase that, based on crystal structure data, is thought to bind the UDP-GlcNAc donor. Alg14p, on the other hand, maps to the N-terminal domain of MurG containing a structural glycine-rich loop motif, postulated to be involved in recognition of the lipid-linked PPi acceptor, in this case MurNAc-PP-polyprenyl (44Ha S. Walker D. Walker S. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Conserved glycine residues as part of a potential G-loop occur also in Alg14p (61GSGGHTG67). Analysis of the membrane topology of Alg13p indicates that it has neither a signal sequence for ER translocation nor a well defined trans-membrane domain. In contrast, topology predictions for Alg14p suggest a hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide and one to three trans-membrane segments. In accord with these predictions, Western blot analysis showed that Alg13p is localized both to the cytosol and membrane fractions, whereas Alg14p is associated exclusively with the membrane (Fig. 7B). The membrane-bound form of Alg13p seems to be dependent on the presence of Alg14p, because shutting off ALG14 causes the disappearance of Alg13p from the membrane (Fig. 7C). It is not known whether Alg13p is released into the cytosol or is degraded in the absence of Alg14p. We postulated that Alg14p is needed to recruit Alg13p to the membrane and to give rise to the active glycosyltransferase. In support of this hypothesis, we were able to demonstrate a physical interaction of Alg13p and Alg14p by affinity chromatography (Fig. 9). Furthermore, when the enzyme activity was determined in an Alg13p immunoprecipitate obtained from membrane detergent extracts from wild-type cells (Fig. 6, lane 1) or tetO7-ALG14 cells under non-repressed conditions (Fig. 6, lane 5), an efficient elongation of GlcNAc1-PP-Dol was observed. But when ALG14 was shut off (Fig. 6, lane 6), no enzyme activity was detectable in the Alg13p immunoprecipitate, presumably because of depletion of Alg13p (see Fig. 7C). Lack of Alg14p may also explain why cytosolic Alg13p is inactive (Fig. 7A, lane 2). The data at present, however, do not allow us to decide what the precise function of Alg13p and Alg14p, respectively, is in the glycosyl-transfer. The available x-ray crystal structures and the structural similarities among the sequences of glycosyltransferases suggest Alg14p as a candidate to be involved in acceptor binding, whereas Alg13p may contain the transferase activity. It is also not clear at the moment, while demonstrating a physical association between the two proteins, why an immunoprecipitate using Alg14p as bait (Fig. 6, lane 3) leads to an inactive enzyme, whereas the Alg13p immunoprecipitate is active (Fig. 6, lane 1). We suppose that under the stringent washing conditions of the immunoprecipitate, the somewhat water-soluble Alg13p dissociates from Alg14p, which is not or is less the case in the reverse situation when Alg13p is the target. What could be the benefit of having two separate modules in the eukaryotic enzymes as compared with the prokaryotic homologs? One possibility could be that such an organization provides a level of regulation of this early step of eukaryotic N-glycosylation to assure a cellularly coordinated and efficient formation of the unique core oligosaccharide, when needed. Independently, a further detailed structural and biochemical analysis will be required to unravel the interplay of the two proteins. Having identified the genes in the synthesis of GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, one should also be able to diagnose potential defects in the existing human orthologs that may cause a new subtype in the congenital disorders of glycosylation. We are grateful to J. Stolz for providing pVT100 plasmids and stimulating discussions. We also acknowledge the excellent technical assistance of Angelika Rechenmacher."

Stellar nucleosynthesis and cosmic ray spallation are ruled out as causes of the anomaly, but photochemical reactions in the early solar nebula could produce the isotopic composition. The large 33S excess present in oldhamite from the Norton County aubrite (0.161 per mil) suggests that refractory sulfide minerals condensed from a nebular gas with an enhanced carbon-oxygen ratio, but otherwise solar composition is the carrier. The presence of a mass-independent sulfur effect in meteorites argues for a similar process that could account for oxygen isotopic anomalies observed in refractory inclusions in primitive chondrites."

To understand how condensin manipulates DNA, we used two in vitro assays to study the role of SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) proteins and ATP in reconfiguring the path of DNA. The first assay evaluated the topology of knots formed in the presence of topoisomerase II. Unexpectedly, both wild-type Smc2/4 and an ATPase mutant promoted (+) chiral knotting of nicked plasmids, revealing that ATP hydrolysis and the non-SMC condensins are not required to compact DNA chirally. The second assay measured Smc2/4-dependent changes in linking number (Lk). Smc2/4 did not induce (+) supercoiling, but instead induced broadening of topoisomer distributions in a cooperative manner without altering Lk0. To explain chiral knotting in substrates devoid of chiral supercoiling, we propose that Smc2/4 directs chiral DNA compaction by constraining the duplex to retrace its own path. In this highly cooperative process, both (+) and (-) loops are sequestered (about one per kb), leaving net writhe and twist unchanged while broadening Lk. We have developed a quantitative theory to account for these results. Additionally, we have shown at higher molar stoichiometries that Smc2/4 prevents relaxation by topoisomerase I and nick closure by DNA ligase, indicating that Smc2/4 can saturate DNA. By electron microscopy of Smc2/4-DNA complexes, we observed primarily two protein-laden bound species: long flexible filaments and uniform rings or “doughnuts.” Close packing of Smc2/4 on DNA explains the substrate protection we observed.

The SMC proteins are large (∼150 kDa) and contain five structural motifs that include N- and C-terminal globular domains, a central hinge domain (H), and two long α-helices (αN and αC) arranged as follows: N-αN-H-αC-C. Coiled-coil pairing of αN and αC folds a single SMC protein symmetrically, placing the hinge at one end and the co-folded N- and C-terminal SMC “head” domains at the other (24Hirano M. Hirano T.

Nucleotide binding does not, however, lead to stable SMC pairing, as some hinge mutants and hingeless variants of the Bacillus subtilis SMC protein remain monomeric even in the presence of ATP (24Hirano M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5733-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). More stable association of the SMC head domains is thought to require the non-SMC subunit known as kleisin (Brn1 in Saccharomyces), which interacts with both heads and completes the tripartite SMC ring (30Schleiffer A.

Hirano T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2664-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As members of the ATP-binding cassette family of ATPases, all SMC proteins bear the signature sequence -LSGGK-, in addition to the Walker A and Walker B nucleotide-binding motifs (34Harvey S. Krien M. O'Connell M. Genome Biology. 2002; http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/2/reviews/3003PubMed Google Scholar, 35Holland I. Blight M. J. Mol.

ATP binding and hydrolysis by the SMC proteins are essential for yeast viability, and mutation of the phosphate-binding loop or ATP-binding cassette signature motif of a single protomer of an SMC pair prevents hydrolysis by the wild-type partner (16Stray J. Lindsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26238-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The essentiality of ATP for condensin function is clear, but its precise role in the rearrangement of DNA is not. In vitro studies of DNA reconfiguration by condensin were first performed with affinity-purified 13 S holo-condensin and the 8 S SMC heterodimer isolated from mitotic and interphase Xenopus egg extracts (38Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar - 40Kimura K. Rybenkov V. Crisona N. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N.

These early studies revealed two intriguing ATP-dependent condensin activities: DNA (+) knotting and (+) supercoiling in the presence of topoisomerases. Both the interphase and, to a much greater degree, the mitotic 13 S holoenzymes promote topoisomerase (topo) 3The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; Lk, linking number; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; AMPPCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate; AMPPNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; EM, electron microscopy. II-dependent (+) chiral knotting of nicked plasmids. However, only the mitotic condensin fosters topo I-dependent (+) supercoiling of relaxed plasmids. The Xenopus 8 S condensin lacks both activities. A complex from Caenorhabditis elegans containing the Smc4 homolog SMC-4 paired with SMC homolog MIX-1 or DPY-27 was also found to introduce (+) supercoils, although knotting was not tested (41Hagstrom K. Holmes V. Cozzarelli N. Meyer B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The reciprocal situation exists for the human condensin (chromosome-associated proteins hCAP-C, -D2, -E, -G, and -H), which promotes knotting of nicked plasmids, but whose supercoiling activity remains untested (42Losada A. Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 268-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The interpretation is that condensin stabilizes the global positive writhe of DNA, leading to the formation of (+) chiral knots by topo II. In contrast to the inactivity of the Xenopus 8 S condensin, yeast Smc2/4 is able to promote topo II-dependent knotting of nicked plasmids, but does not induce net supercoiling (16Stray J. Lindsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26238-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine directly the topology of knots produced by Smc2/4. We found that knots formed with the wild-type enzyme and an ATP binding/hydrolysis-deficient mutant enzyme were predominantly (+) in sign. Smc2/4 binding did not stabilize (+) supercoils, but caused a marked increase in the variance of topoisomer distributions (σ2). We developed a model to explain these results. We show that chiral knots can be formed in substrates with minimum writhe when a DNA duplex is constrained to retrace its own path. Chiral geometries so formed can strongly bias the sign of knots formed without changing the average linking number (Lk) upon relaxation. We explain Lk broadening by suggesting that both (+) and (-) DNA loops are stabilized when Smc2/4 binds. We discovered that Smc2/4 coats DNA to form long filamentous structures on linear DNA and uniformly sized compact rings upon binding to linear or circular DNA. The architecture of the SMC proteins suggests that they could grasp multiple DNA duplexes. Our working hypothesis is that, binding more than one DNA duplex at a time and driven further by lateral interactions between them, the condensin SMC proteins chirally compact DNA. Protein Purification and Antibody Generation—The expression and purification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type Smc2/4 and the ATPase double mutant Smc2-P/4-P were performed as described previously (16Stray J. Lindsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26238-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The purity of enzymes used in this study was > 95% as judged by Coomassie Blue and silver staining of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). Topoisomerase I was purified from raw wheat germ (43Dynan W. Jendrisak J. Hager D. Burgess R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5860-5865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phage T4 topo II was generously provided by Wai-Mun Huang (University of Utah). Anti-Smc2 antiserum was raised in rabbits immunized against highly purified recombinant Smc2, additionally separated, and excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Total IgG was purified by protein A affinity chromatography, and the Smc2-specific IgG fraction was isolated by elution from immobilized Smc2. Antibodies were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 5% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA and stored at -80 °C. DNA Supercoiling and Knotting Reactions—Measurements of DNA supercoiling were made with the 3-kb plasmid pBluescript™ SK(+) (Stratagene) or the easily nicked 3-kb derivative pJES131, which bears a BbvCI site in the pBluescript™ SK(+) multiple cloning site. Nicks generated with N.BbvCI-A or N.BbvCI-B (New England Biolabs Inc.) were efficiently sealed with T4 or Escherichia coli DNA ligase. To eliminate all (-) supercoiled DNA, which would have biased knot chirality or been a source of error in Lk analysis by nick closure, it was necessary to use nicking conditions that generated some linear DNA. Reactions (25 μl) were assembled on ice in 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.9); 75 mm KCl; 5% glycerol; 0.2 mm EDTA; 0.2 mm EGTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 3 mm Mg(OAc)2; 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; 0 or 1 mm ATP, ADP, ATPγS, AMPPCP, or AMPPNP; and 10 ng (0.2 nm) of substrate plasmid. Smc2/4 (0-512 nm) was added next, and the reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. DNA substrates were relaxed or ligated by adding 20 ng of wheat germ topo I for relaxed plasmids or 0.4 units of T4 DNA ligase or 0.1 unit of E. coli DNA ligase for nicked plasmids and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. For ligation with E. coli DNA ligase, 100 μm NAD+ was added at time 0. Reactions were quenched by adding 25 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.3), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K and digested for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and recovered by ethanol precipitation. Resolved topoisomers were analyzed by Southern blotting. For preparative scale knotting, reactions were performed in 5 × 300-μl volumes containing 200 ng (2.6 nm) of a 7.2-kb plasmid singly nicked with DNase I in the presence of ethidium bromide. To this was added a 64-fold molar excess (170 nm) of wild-type or ATPase mutant Smc2/4, and reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Bacteriophage T4 topo II (20 ng) was then added, and incubation was continued for 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were quenched and processed as described for supercoiling assays. Recovered DNA was separated on Tris acetate/EDTA (TAE) 0.8% agarose gels (see Fig. 4, A and B) or in TAE containing 0.03% SDS (see Fig. 4C) as described (44Levinger L. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3244-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). DNA was detected by ethidium bromide staining or by Southern blotting. Knotted DNA for electron microscopy (EM) analysis was purified from agarose gels as described (45Crisona N. Kanaar R. Gonzalez T. Zechiedrich E. Klippel A. Cozzarelli N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Analysis of Lk Broadening—Autoradiographic exposures were analyzed using a STORM™ PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Measured topoisomer intensities were fit to gaussian distributions using MicroCal Origin™ 3.78 software by nonlinear least-square minimization: y = (A(2/π)1/2/w)exp(-2(x - xc)2/w2) + y0, where y is the band intensity, A is the area under the curve, w is the distribution width, x is the band position (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2, etc.), xc is the distribution center, and y0 is the base-line offset term for band intensity. The variance of the topoisomer distribution (σ2) equals w2/4. EM Analysis of DNA Knot Chirality—Knotted DNA was prepared for EM to visualize DNA crossings as described previously (45Crisona N. Kanaar R. Gonzalez T. Zechiedrich E. Klippel A. Cozzarelli N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified nicked DNA knots were denatured with glyoxal, coated with RecA protein in the presence of ATP, fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 15 min, and purified by size exclusion over Sepharose CL-4B. RecA-coated DNA was deposited onto glow-discharged, carbon-coated Formvar grids (Ted Pella, Inc.) and stained for 30 s in 2% uranyl acetate prior to rotary and directional shadowing with tungsten. Knots were photographed at a magnification of ×50,000, and the topological sign of the crossings was determined. EM of Smc2/4-DNA Complexes—Smc2/4 (15, 50, or 300 nm) was incubated in the presence of 2.7-kb relaxed, 7.2-kb nicked circular, or 7-kb linearized DNA (0.5 nm). Reactions (30 μl) contained 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. After 30 min at 25 °C, glutaraldehyde was added to a final concentration of 0.2%. Cross-linking was quenched after 15 min by the addition of 4 μl of 50 mm glycine in 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.6). Smc2/4-DNA complexes were separated from unbound proteins by Sepharose CL-2B chromatography, applied to grids, and processed as described above. DNA Knotting Is Promoted by Smc2/4 and the ATPase Mutant Smc2-P/4-P—Smc2/4 was shown previously to promote topo II-dependent knotting of circular DNA, indicating DNA compaction (16Stray J. Lindsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26238-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, we could not determine whether this activity was ATP-dependent because the type II topoisomerases also required ATP. Here, we tested the ATPase double mutant Smc2-P/4-P (16Stray J. Lindsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26238-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in which the sequence GKS in the phosphate-binding loop of each SMC protein was mutated to AAA, inactivating ATP hydrolysis. In UV cross-linking studies, we saw relatively weak cross-linking of ATP to the wild-type enzyme and reproducibly diminished cross-linking to the P-loop mutant enzymes. High background labeling, possibly due to ATP binding elsewhere in the enzymes, prevented us from concluding that we had ablated ATP binding in the active site of the mutant enzyme. Although the double P-loop mutant is incapable of hydrolyzing ATP, it still promoted knotting much like the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1, A and B). The yield of knots in replicate experiments with each enzyme was variable. For example, Fig. 1C shows a highly efficient knotting reaction in which Smc2-P/4-P directed the conversion of nearly 50% of the substrate to knots. This inter- and intra-assay variability makes it impossible to conclude that ATP hydrolysis stimulates knotting. As with the Xenopus holo-condensin, Smc2/4 promoted the creation of far fewer four-noded knots than trefoil knots and favored the formation of five-noded knots over four-noded knots (Fig. 1C). This is most easily judged by comparing the distribution in Fig. 1C with the twist knot ladder, for which the abundance of knots diminishes exponentially with each additional crossing (46Wasserman S. Cozzarelli N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20567-20573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The knotting pattern is fully consistent with our model for chiral structures configured by Smc2/4, as explained under “Discussion.” Our results show that DNA binding alone, without the requirement for ATP hydrolysis, is sufficient for Smc2/4 to fold DNA and promote knotting. Chiral Knotting Does Not Require ATP Hydrolysis by Smc2/4—The type and chirality of knots are reporters of the conformation that DNA molecules are in at the time of topo II action. We determined the topology of DNA knots formed by T4 topo II in the presence of Smc2/4 and Smc2-P/4-P by EM. We examined 77 knots produced using the wild-type enzyme and 130 knots produced with the ATPase mutant enzyme. Examples of these knots are presented in Fig. 1D. A summary of the topology and type of knots identified is presented in TABLE ONE. For the wild-type enzyme, 89% of the three-noded (trefoil) knots scored (+). This is comparable with the percentage of (+) trefoils (95%) seen with the mitotic Xenopus condensin (40Kimura K. Rybenkov V. Crisona N. Hirano T. Cozzarelli N. Cell. 1999; 98: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Trefoils formed with the mutant enzyme were also predominantly positive (72%). Statistical analysis suggests that the wild-type and mutant distributions are highly significantly different from random (p < 10-5) and significantly different from one another (p = 0.012). We conclude that, although there is no absolute ATP requirement for (+) chiral knotting, nucleotide hydrolysis may aid Smc2/4 in chirally reconfiguring DNA. Surprisingly, chiral knotting by Smc2/4 did not require the non-SMC condensin proteins or mitotic modification.TABLE ONEQuantitative knot analysis Knots formed with 7-kb nicked DNA in the presence of either wild-type or mutant Smc2/4 and phage T4 topo II were analyzed by EM. (+) and (-) indicate positive and negative topological crossings, respectively. Trefoils are knots containing three nodes. See Ref. 67Vologodskii A. Topology and Physics of Circular DNA.

For example, all 10 of the five-noded torus knots obtained with wild-type and mutant Smc2/4 were (+) (Fig. 1D, panels 5 and 6). The simple knots, like the trefoil and four-noded knot, or twist knots containing multiple crossings, like those in Fig. 1D (panels 2-4) with five, six, and seven nodes each, can be formed by a single duplex passage. More complex twist knots and higher order torus knots require multiple, sequential transport of one DNA segment through another. For example, the granny knot requires two duplex passages, and the five- and seven-noded torus knots require two and three, respectively (Fig. 1D, panels 5-8) (47Darcey I. Sumners D. Suzuki S. Knots '96. World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore1997: 267-278Google Scholar). In our reactions, topo II catalyzed multiple passage events and, like the Xenopus condensin, resulted in the Smc2/4-dependent formation of largely (+) complex knots. Effect of Smc2/4 on Lk Distributions—The generation of (+) knots by Smc2/4 led us to expect that supercoiling assays would reflect this chiral preference as well. Supercoiling by Smc2/4 was analyzed quantitatively with relaxed DNA, increasing molar equivalents of Smc2/4, and wheat germ topo I under conditions identical to those used for knotting (Fig. 2A). We obtained three significant results. First, Smc2/4 caused the width of topoisomer distributions (the variance, σ2) to increase without the net accumulation of (+)or(-) supercoils (Fig. 2A, lanes 8-11). The latter result had been observed previously (16Stray J. Lindsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26238-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This lack of effect on Lk was initially puzzling in light of our (+) knotting results; however, the increase in Lk variance suggested an explanation. The spread in topoisomers arises naturally from random thermal fluctuations in DNA writhe and twist. To quantify changes in this base-line width, band intensity data from Fig. 2A were fit to gaussian distributions to obtain the variance for each distribution. The fitted data are presented in Fig. 2B. Maximum broadening occurred at a protein:DNA ratio of 128:1 (Fig. 2C): a 1.7-fold increase in σ2 compared with DNA relaxed in the absence of protein (3.2 versus 1.9). The apparent negative shift in Lk at ratios above 256:1 is not due to the action of Smc2/4, but rather the inability of topo I to relax the starting substrate (see below). The second significant result was the aforementioned lack of shift in Lk0. Despite the marked increases in variance at high protein ratios (Fig. 2, B and C), the fitted center of distributions remained unchanged (Fig. 2D). This constancy of Lk0 suggests that there is no net change in writhe or twist in DNA circles bound by Smc2/4. However, the existence of knotting and Lk broadening shows that the lack of change was not due to the absence of DNA binding or compaction by Smc2/4. Third, as mentioned, we detected an Smc2/4-dependent inhibition of topo I relaxation at or above a ratio of 256:1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 12-14). This was easy to detect because Lk0 for the starting substrate was shifted by approximately one (-) topoisomer relative to the relaxed products (Fig. 2A, lane 6 versus lane 5, 15, or 16). Inhibition was total at the highest ratios (Fig. 2D). Relaxation by vaccinia virus topo I, an enzyme one-third the mass of the wheat germ topo I, was also inhibited (data not shown). The impenetrable quality of Smc2/4-DNA complexes emerged when the molar excess of Smc2/4 to DNA approached one Smc2/4 complex per ∼30 bp. We suggest that substrate protection signals a binding change in which condensed DNA becomes saturated by Smc2/4. Neither Smc2/4 nor the ATPase Mutant Smc2-P/4-P Shifts Lk0 upon Ligation of Nicked Plasmids—To confirm the unexpected increase in topoisomer variance, the lack of shift in Lk, and the occlusion of topo I, we measured Smc2/4 supercoiling by a complementary and more quantitative method: nick ligation. In this assay, a singly nicked plasmid was ligated in the presence of Smc2/4 using either T4 (Fig. 3) or E. coli (Fig. 4) DNA ligase. The chief advantage of this method over topo I assays is that relaxation cannot be incomplete, and any unligated DNA is easily resolved from the relaxed topoisomer distribution. The results of a typical assay and the corresponding Gaussian fits are presented in Fig. 3 (A and B, respectively). Changes in σ2 could be detected at ratios as low as 16:1. In this particular experiment, the variance increased nearly 3-fold between 8:1 and 32:1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5) and became maximum at higher stoichiometries (Fig. 3C). In six independent assays, Lk broadening rose sharply between a 16- and 64-fold molar excess of Smc2/4 to plasmid. The maximum Lk broadening was 5.5 ± 0.6 topoisome"

The redox and spectroscopic properties of the rubredoxin (Rd), non-heme diiron, and FMN sites of flavorubredoxin were determined, which was complemented by the study of truncated versions of FlRd: one consisting only of its rubredoxin module, and another consisting of its flavodiiron structural core (lacking the Rd domain). The studies here reported were performed by a combination of potentiometry with visible and EPR spectroscopies. Moreover, we present the first direct EPR evidence for the presence of the non-heme diiron site in the flavodiiron proteins family. Also, the redox properties of the FlRd physiological partner, the NADH:flavorubredoxin oxidoreductase (FlRd-Red), were determined. It is further shown that the redox properties of this complex electron transfer system are fine-tuned upon interaction of the two enzymes."

In response to activation of certain G protein-coupled receptors that persistently elevate IP3 concentration, IP3 receptors are ubiquitinated and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. IP3 receptor ubiquitination is mediated by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, mamUbc7, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. However, the mechanism by which ubiquitinated IP3 receptors are transferred to the proteasome is not known. Here, we examine this process and show in several mammalian cell types that the ATPase p97 associates with IP3 receptors in response to hormonal stimuli that induce IP3 receptor ubiquitination. To examine the functional relevance of the p97 interaction with IP3 receptors, we stably and specifically reduced p97 protein levels by 62 ± 3% in Rat-1 fibroblasts using RNA interference. In these cells, endothelin-1-induced IP3 receptor degradation was markedly retarded and the accumulation of ubiquitinated IP3 receptors was markedly enhanced. These effects were reversed by expression of exogenous p97. In addition, Ufd1 and Npl4, which complex with p97, also associated with IP3 receptors upon hormonal stimulation. We conclude that the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex couples ubiquitinated IP3 receptors to proteasomal degradation and, thus, plays a key role in IP3 receptor processing.

IP3 diffuses into the cytosol and mobilizes Ca2+ by binding to IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) present in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Hence, IP3Rs play a pivotal role in converting cues conveyed by extracellular stimuli into intracellular Ca2+ signals (1Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (25Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar), or unassembled subunits of multiprotein complexes, such as T-cell receptor subunits TCRα (26Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and CD3-δ (26Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp.

Regulated ERAD, on the other hand, accounts for the degradation of native ER proteins in response to various stimuli. For example, in yeast and mammalian cells, 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, an ER membrane protein, is polyubiquitinated and degraded in response to sterols (28Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G.

In the case of IP3Rs, putative conformational changes associated with receptor activation (5Taylor C.W. da Fonseca P.C.A. Morris E.P. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 2003; 278: 38238-38246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which catalyzes the ubiquitination of many ERAD substrates (27Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, as IP3Rs are unique in being rapidly convertible from their native form into ERAD substrates, they provide a valuable system for studying the mechanism of ERAD in mammalian cells. An intriguing feature of ERAD substrates is that they have to be translocated from the ER to reach the proteasome. While the mechanism involved is poorly understood, several recent studies have implicated a cytosolic ATPase, termed p97 or VCP in mammals and Cdc48p in yeast, in this retrotranslocation process (33Hirsch C.

Cell. 2001; 12: 4114-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). p97 is a member of AAA ATPase family and is involved in a wide variety of cellular activities, including vesicular transport, homotypic membrane fusion, dissociation of a ubiquitinated membrane-tethered transcription factor from its non-ubiquitinated binding partner, and proteasome-mediated protein degradation (40Dreveny I. Pye V.E. Beuron F. Briggs L.C. Isaacson R.L. Matthews S.J. McKeown C. Xuan X. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 41Wang Q.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). p97 is coupled to these various cellular activities by a set of cofactors or adaptor proteins (40Dreveny I. Pye V.E.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For example, VCIP135 and p47 associate with p97 to recruit it to membrane fusion events (43Wang Y. Satoh A. Warren G. Meyer H.H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 44Uchiyama K. Jokitalo E. Kano F. Murata M. Zhang X. Canas B. Newman R. Rabouille C. Pappin D. Freemont P.

Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Likewise, heterodimers of Ufd1 and Npl4 form a complex with p97 and help recruit it to ubiquitinated substrates (46Bruderer B.M. Brasseur C. Meyer H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49609-49616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 47Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G.

In the present study, we examined whether p97 and its cofactors are involved in IP3R down-regulation. We report that p97, Ufd1, and Npl4 all rapidly associate with IP3Rs under conditions that lead to IP3R ubiquitination and that this association correlates with the extent to which IP3Rs are ubiquitinated. Moreover, suppression of p97 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) impaired the regulated ERAD of IP3Rs. Our results indicate that the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex is required for the processing of ubiquitinated IP3Rs and, thus, that this complex plays a key role in ERAD in mammalian cells. Materials—αT3-1 mouse anterior pituitary gonadotrope cells were obtained and cultured as described (11Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol.

Cox, University of North Carolina, and were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were fed every other day and subcultured every 3–5 days using 0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA. Antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal anti-IP3R1 (11Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K.

SDS, Triton X-100, Igepal CA-630, protease inhibitors, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), cycloheximide, and polybrene (hexamethrine bromide) were purchased from Sigma; endothelin-1 (ET1) was from Calbiochem; T4 ligase, BglII, and HindIII were obtained from New England Biolabs; Precision Plus Protein™ Standards and dithiothreitol were from Bio-Rad; G418 was from Cellgro; Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Biosciences; N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) was from Alexis; bortezomib (PS-341) was obtained from Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Cambridge, MA); and puromycin was from Clontech. Electrophoresis, Immunoblotting, and Quantitation—Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose essentially as described (10Oberdorf J. Webster J.M. Zhu C.C. Luo S.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), probed with relevant primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and immunoreactivity was visualized with Pierce chemiluminescence reagents. Immunoreactivity was quantitated using a Genegnome Imager (Syngene Bio Imaging). Data shown are mean ± S.E. or representative of ≥3 independent experiments. IP3R1 Immunoprecipitation—For αT3-1 gonadotropes, cells were grown to near confluence in 15-cm diameter dishes and were incubated with or without GnRH. Cells were then harvested by vigorous scraping and pipetting in culture medium, pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g for 6 min at 4 °C), and solubilized in Igepal CA-630 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630 (v/v), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8) for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and IP3R1 was immunoprecipitated by incubating with anti-IP3R1 for 1 h followed by Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 3 h. Immunocomplexes were washed thoroughly with Igepal CA-630 lysis buffer, resuspended in gel loading buffer (10Oberdorf J. Webster J.M. Zhu C.C. Luo S.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), electrophoresed, and immunoblotted. For Rat-1 fibroblasts, cells were grown to near confluence in 15-cm diameter dishes and were serum-starved for about 15 h. Cells were then incubated with or without ET1 and after removing culture medium were lysed by adding Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8) directly to cell monolayers followed by vigorous scraping. After 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and IP3R1 was immunoprecipitated and processed in immunoblots as described for αT3-1 cells. Levels of IP3Rs and Other Proteins—For measurement of IP3R down-regulation, serum-starved Rat-1 cells were incubated with or without ET1 and after removing culture medium were harvested by adding Triton X-100 lysis buffer directly to cell monolayers followed by vigorous scraping. After 30 min at 4 °C, lysates were cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), supernatants were collected, estimated for protein content, and equal amounts of protein were immunoblotted with anti-IP3R1 and anti-IP3R3. Essentially, identical methods were used to monitor the levels of ubiquitin conjugates, p27 and p53, in cell lysates. Subcellular Fractionation—Rat-1 cells were harvested by scraping into 155 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g for 6 min at 4 °C), resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris base, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4), and disrupted with 40 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged (1100 × g for 6 min at 4 °C) to pellet nuclei, and the supernatants were re-centrifuged (100,000 × g for 1h at 4 °C). The supernatants from this step were designated as cytosolic fractions, while pellets and nuclei were then solubilized with Triton X-100 lysis buffer and re-centrifuged (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to obtain membrane and nuclear fractions. Supernatants were estimated for protein content and equivalent amounts of each fraction were then immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin. RNAi Design and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—The pSUPER.retro vector (49Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar, 50Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) was used to introduce short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting p97 into Rat-1 fibroblasts. Two 64-base complementary oligonucleotides (forward, 5′-gatccccgtaggctatgatgacatcgttcaagagacgatgtcatcatagcctactttttggaaa-3′ and reverse, 5′-agcttttccaaaaagtaggctatgatgacatcgtc-tcttgaacgatgtcatcatagcctacggg-3′) were synthesized to contain a 19-nucleotide sequence (bold) corresponding to nucleotides 812–830 of Rattus norvegicus p97 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_053864), separated from the reverse complement of the same 19 nucleotides by a 9-nucleotide spacer. The annealed product contains 5′ and 3′ overhangs compatible with BglII and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, and was ligated into pSUPER.retro digested with BglII and HindIII, generating pSUPER.retro.p97. In parallel, three different control vectors encoding random siRNA (pSUPER.retro.ran1–3) were constructed using a 19-nucleotide sequence with no known homology to any of the known rat mRNAs. Correct ligation into pSUPER.retro was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. To generate infectious retroviral stock, pSUPER.retro.p97 or pSUPER.retro.ran1–3 were transfected together with pVPack-Eco, which encodes viral envelope, and pVPack-GP, which encodes Gag-pol (Stratagene), into 293T cells using the calcium-phosphate method (51Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 16.14-16.16Google Scholar). 72 h posttransfection, culture medium was removed and passed through a 0.45-μm filter (Nalgene). Virus-containing media were aliquoted and frozen at –80 °C until use. To transduce Rat-1 cells, cells were seeded in a 12-well plate, and after 24 h, viruses were added along with 8 μg/ml polybrene, and cells were incubated for 8 h at 37°C, followed by a change of medium. After 48 h, transduced cells were selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin and after several passages were maintained in 1 μg/ml puromycin. Expression of Exogenous p97—cDNA encoding full-length, aminoterminal HA-tagged mouse p97 (HA-p97) was a kind gift from Dr. Masaki Matsumoto, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. To render the mRNA encoded by this plasmid refractory to the siRNA targeting endogenous p97, five silent mutations were introduced into the targeted region using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene) and were confirmed by sequencing. p97 cells (∼80% confluent) were transfected with 1 μg of either pcDNA3 (vector) or HA-p97 plasmid using 8 μl of CytoPure-™huv (Qbiogene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, cells were subcultured and grown in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. Sterile cloning cylinders were used to select G418-resistant clones, which were then screened for HA-p97 expression. Five clones expressing high levels of HA-p97 and four vector-transfected clones were used to analyze IP3R ubiquitination and down-regulation. Measurement of Ca2+ Mobilization—Serum-starved Rat-1 cells were harvested in and washed with 155 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, resuspended in Krebs-HEPES buffer (30Zhu C.C. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3476-3484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and then incubated with 10 μm Fura2-AM at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min, washed twice, incubated again at 37 °C for 30 min, again washed twice, resuspended in 2 ml of Krebs-HEPES buffer, placed in a cuvette, and excited at 340 and 380 nm. Fluorescence emission was recorded using a computerized LS-50B flourimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10 mm EGTA were used to determine the maximum and minimum fluorescence values, respectively. 340/380 nm emission ratios were used to calculate intracellular Ca2+ as described (32Webster J.M.

Dynamic Association of the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 Complex with IP3Rs—Initially, we used αT3-1 mouse anterior pituitary gonadotropes to investigate mechanisms involved in GPCR-initiated IP3R down-regulation. These cells express phospholipase C-linked GnRH receptors, and GnRH induces rapid and robust ubiquitination and down-regulation of IP3R1, the predominant IP3R in this cell type (11Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 940-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that GnRH-induced IP3R1 ubiquitination peaked at ∼5 min and thereafter declined as IP3R1 was degraded (lanes 1–4). As is typical for UPP substrates, inclusion of proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated IP3R1 and blocked IP3R1 down-regulation (lane 5). Probing for co-immunoprecipitating proteins revealed that p97, Ufd1, and Npl4 all associated with IP3R1 after GnRH stimulation in a manner that correlated with the levels of ubiquitinated species (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–4), indicating that the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex is recruited to participate in the processing of ubiquitinated IP3R1. Additionally, Fig. 1A shows that the U-box protein Ufd2 (52Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S.

The γ subunit of retinal transducin (Tα/Tβγ) is selectively farnesylated, and the farnesylation is required for light signaling mediated by transducin in rod cells. However, whether and how this selective isoprenylation regulates cellular functions remain poorly understood. Here we report that knockin mice expressing geranylgeranylated Tγ showed normal rod responses to dim flashes under dark-adapted conditions but exhibited impaired properties in light adaptation. Of note, geranylgeranylation of Tγ suppressed light-induced transition of Tβγ from membrane to cytosol, and also attenuated its light-dependent translocation from the outer segment to the inner region, an event contributing to retinal light adaptation. These results indicate that, while the farnesylation of transducin is interchangeable with the geranylgeranylation in terms of the light signaling, the selective farnesylation is important for visual sensitivity regulation by providing sufficient but not excessive membrane anchoring of Tβγ.

Protein isoprenylation is an important posttranslational lipid modification. One of two types of isoprenoids, farnesyl (C15) and geranylgeranyl (C20), is linked via a thioether bond to the C-terminal cysteine residue of a variety of cellular proteins, such as heterotrimeric G protein γ subunits and small G proteins (Gautam et al., 1998Gautam N.

Also, the selective isoprenylation has attracted considerable attention from the functional standpoint (Fu and Casey, 1999Fu H.W. Casey P.J.

Generally, C-terminal sequences with the CAAX motif (C and A being cysteine and aliphatic amino acids, respectively) direct protein isoprenylation, and the X residue is the major determinant for the alternative isoprenylation catalyzed by either farnesyltransferase or geranylgeranyltransferase type I (Fu and Casey, 1999Fu H.W. Casey P.J. Enzymology and biology of CaaX protein prenylation.Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1999; 54: 315-342PubMed Google Scholar). Following isoprenylation, the last three amino acids are cleaved by the type II CAAX prenyl endopeptidase (RCE1) (Kim et al., 1999Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K.

For transducin, farnesylation of recombinant Tβγ in insect cells can be replaced by geranylgeranylation by coexpressing Tβ and mutant Tγ having the C-terminal sequence of CVIL (in place of CVIS for farnesylation), which directs geranylgeranylation (Matsuda et al., 1998Matsuda T.

Under in vitro conditions, transducin still functions when the farnesyl is replaced by the geranylgeranyl (and vice versa for other heterotrimeric G proteins; see Matsuda et al., 1998Matsuda T.

On the other hand, transducin reconstituted with unmodified Tγ (i.e., neither farnesylated nor geranylgeranylated) exhibits essentially no GTP binding activity (Fukada et al., 1989Fukada Y. Ohguro H.

Likewise, isoprenylation of a small G protein Ras is essential for its transforming activity (Casey et al., 1989Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), for which the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl are functionally interchangeable (Cox et al., 1992Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Specific isoprenoid modification is required for function of normal, but not oncogenic, Ras protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, in spite of the widely accepted role of the modifying lipid as a membrane anchor, Ras requires selective farnesylation for its growth function (Cox et al., 1992Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Specific isoprenoid modification is required for function of normal, but not oncogenic, Ras protein.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, selective isoprenylation either by the farnesyl or by the geranylgeranyl has raised a long-standing question of how the isoprenoid attached covalently to G proteins regulates intracellular G protein-mediated signaling. To study the functional role of the selective farnesylation of transducin more closely, we have generated a knockin mouse line in which rod transducin was geranylgeranylated instead. We have found that the farnesyl-to-geranylgeranyl replacement in Tγ markedly affects light adaptation of the mouse retina, without affecting the photoresponse of rods in the dark-adapted state. At the cellular level, this physiological phenotype is associated with a slowdown of the massive light-dependent translocation of Tβγ, which is one of the important cellular processes underlying light adaptation. These results provide evidence for the physiological importance of the selective farnesylation versus geranylgeranylation in G protein signaling. We produced knockin mice with the S74L mutation in Tγ by targeting the vector harboring the S74L mutation to the Tγ gene (Figure 1B). The targeted embryonic stem (ES) cell lines were cloned and used for production of chimeric mice (see Figures S1A and S1B in the Supplemental Data available online). After the heterozygous mice were established, the neo gene was deleted from the recombinant allele by Cre-loxP-mediated recombination (Figures 1B and 1C). The retinal morphology of the knockin mice homozygous for the S74L mutation (S74L/S74L) was normal, with unaltered thickness of each retinal layer and no symptom of retinal degeneration even in 6-month-old animals (Figures 5A and 5B). Expression levels of retinal proteins in +/S74L and S74L/S74L mice were indistinguishable from those of wild-type (Figure 1D). To examine the molecular structure of Tγ, rod outer segment membranes were isolated from wild-type and S74L/S74L mice and exposed to room light for induced formation of a ternary complex composed of transducin and light-activated rhodopsin. Wild-type transducin was extracted as a soluble form by mixing the irradiated membrane suspension with 10 μM GTPγS, which led to dissociation of Tα-GTPγS and Tβγ from light-activated rhodopsin (Kuhn, 1980Kuhn H. Light- and GTP-regulated interaction of GTPase and other proteins with bovine photoreceptor membranes.Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the GTPγS-extract, we detected two major peaks, one containing Tγ and the other Tα (Figure 2A ), while Tβ was adsorbed to the column (Fukada et al., 1994Fukada Y. Matsuda T. Kokame K. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Akino T. Yoshizawa T. Effects of carboxyl methylation of photoreceptor G protein γ subunit in visual transduction.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tγ in the first peak showed a molecular mass of 8316.1 (Figure S2A), in good agreement with the calculated mass of the fully processed (i.e., farnesylated and methylated) form of mouse Tγ (molecular mass of 8315.6). Top-down analysis of isolated Tγ using the electrospray ionization (ESI)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (Kassai et al., 2005Kassai H. Satomi Y. Fukada Y. Takao T. Top-down analysis of protein isoprenylation by electrospray ionization hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry; the mouse Tγ protein.Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2005; 19: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) demonstrated the covalent modification of Tγ by the farnesyl and methyl groups within the extreme C-terminal region (Pro58-Cys71, Figures S2C and S2E), as predicted from the CAAX signal (CVIS) directing farnesylation/methylation at the C-terminal Cys71. On the other hand, from S74L/S74L mice, only a trace of soluble Tγ was detected in the GTPγS extract (Figure 2C), whereas Tα was detected at a level comparable to that from wild-type mice (Figure 2A). In order to analyze the mutant Tγ that had remained in the membrane (as a Tβγ complex), we extracted mutant Tβγ by mixing the GTPγS-treated membranes with bacterially expressed phosducin. Phosducin stably forms a soluble complex with farnesylated Tβγ (Lee et al., 1987Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Lolley R.N.

Commun. 1996; 223: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and also with its geranylgeranylated form (Matsuda and Y.F., unpublished data; see also Figure 6E). In the HPLC analysis of the phosducin-extracted sample from S74L/S74L mice, we found that Tγ was eluted at a position (retention time = 28.4 min) slightly later than wild-type Tγ (25.6 min), and its molecular mass of 8383.3 agreed well with a calculated value of the geranylgeranylated and methylated form of mouse Tγ (8383.7; Figure 2D and Figure S2B). Detailed analysis of mutant Tγ using ESI-MS/MS confirmed the presence of the geranylgeranyl and methyl groups in the C-terminal fragment (Pro58-Cys71, Figures S2D and S2F), most probably attached to Cys71. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of mutant Tγ was verified to be identical to wild-type starting from Pro2 (Fukada et al., 1990Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Farnesylated γ subunit of photoreceptor G protein indispensable for GTP-binding.Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The phosducin extract prepared similarly from wild-type mice contained an undetectable level of Tγ, supporting stoichiometric quality of our analysis. We next compared the activities of farnesylated and geranylgeranylated Tβγ by measuring the initial velocity of GTPγS binding in the retinal lysates prepared from wild-type and S74L/S74L mice. Upon exposure to a light flash of varying intensity at 4°C, geranylgeranylated transducin in S74L/S74L retinal lysate exhibited 1.3- to 1.9-fold higher initial velocity than farnesylated transducin in the wild-type lysate (Figure 3A ). This observation is consistent with our previous in vitro reconstitution experiments, in which purified wild-type Tα reconstituted with mutated (S74L) Tβγ exhibited a rate constant for GTPγS binding about 3-fold higher than that with wild-type (farnesylated) Tβγ (Matsuda et al., 1998Matsuda T. Hashimoto Y. Ueda H. Asano T. Matsuura Y. Doi T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Fukada Y. Specific isoprenyl group linked to transducin γ subunit is a determinant of its unique signaling properties among G-proteins.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9843-9850Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, however, the difference in the reaction rate between the two genotypes was blunted at 37°C when the membrane concentration was increased (from 0.5 μM to 3 μM in terms of rhodopsin concentration, Figure 3B). In the dilute homogenate in vitro (e.g., 0.5 μM rhodopsin), farnesylated Tβγ may be dissociated partly from outer segment membranes, hence reducing the coupling efficiency between rhodopsin and transducin and resulting in a lower velocity of GTPγS binding compared with geranylgeranylated Tβγ, which is associated more stably with the membrane (see Discussion). Rod photoreceptors are capable of high sensitivity and light adaptation, allowing them to respond to single photons (Baylor et al., 1979Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.W. Responses of retinal rods to single photons.J. Physiol. 1979; 288: 613-634PubMed Google Scholar) and to regulate sensitivity in response to background illumination (Pugh and Lamb, 2000Pugh Jr., E.N.

We used the suction pipette method to record the flash responses from individual rods in the dark-adapted state. Light flashes of increasing intensities elicited similar sets of photoresponses from wild-type and S74L/S74L rods (Figure 4A ). No significant difference was observed between the two lines both in the maximal response amplitude (rmax) and in the light intensity that evoked a half-saturating response (io) (Table 1). The dim-flash responses were also indistinguishable in kinetics (Figure 4B, and tp and ti in Table 1) and in amplitude as evoked by a single photon (a in Table 1, calculated as the response ensemble variance-to-mean ratio, Sung et al., 1994Sung C.H. Makino C. Baylor D. Nathans J.

Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5818-5833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that rod response properties are not affected by the type of isoprenyl modification of Tγ under dark-adapted conditions, consistent with the data on GTPγS binding at high membrane concentration (Figure 3B).Table 1Quantitative Measurements of the Flash Responses from Single RodsWild-Type (n = 19)S74L/S74L (n = 20)rmax (pA)12.6 ± 2.611.6 ± 2.0io (photons/μm2)64.3 ± 24.357.3 ± 17.9tp (ms)160.0 ± 29.3172.3 ± 49.3a (pA)0.54 ± 0.110.52 ± 0.11ti (ms)287.4 ± 152.0276.1 ± 106.8rmax, the maximal response amplitude; io, the flash intensity that gives a half-maximal response; tp, the time-to-peak of dim-flash response; a, the amplitude of the single-photon response, calculated as the dim-flash response ensemble variance-to-mean ratio; ti, the integration time defined as the time integral of the dim-flash response divided by its peak amplitude.

Dim-flash responses were defined as responses with peak amplitudes less than 0.2 rmax. All values were expressed as mean ± SD. We next examined a change in the rod photosensitivity of S74L/S74L mice after prolonged light adaptation by measuring the full-field electroretinogram (ERG) a-wave, well established to reflect the light response of photoreceptors (predominantly rods in mouse). To characterize the amplification of rod phototransduction, the leading edge of the a-wave was fitted with a theoretical trace calculated according to the Lamb-Pugh model (Lamb and Pugh, 1992Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. A quantitative account of the activation steps involved in phototransduction in amphibian photoreceptors.J. Physiol. 1992; 449: 719-758PubMed Google Scholar, Arshavsky et al., 2002Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. G proteins and phototransduction.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures). An important parameter in the fit is the amplification constant (A), which represents the gain factor in the rising phase of rod phototransduction and is therefore a reflection of light sensitivity. We collected a set of ERG responses from a fully dark-adapted animal and calculated Adark. Afterward, the animal was exposed to adapting light (100 lux or 250 lux) for 10 min and then subjected to a second round of ERG recording and Aadapted was derived (Figure S3). No statistically significant difference in the fully dark-adapted A (Adark) value (as well as the parameters amax and teff; see Experimental Procedures) was observed between wild-type and S74L/S74L animals (Table S1, dark). This finding is consistent with the above results from single-cell recordings (Figures 4A and 4B) and indicates that the mutation has no measurable effect on the activation phase of phototransduction in the dark-adapted rod. When kept in the dark during the sham “adaptation” period (control), wild-type and S74L/S74L mice exhibited indistinguishable values of Acontrol/Adark (Figure 4C), which were slightly lower than 1.0, probably owing to adaptation to the test flashes in the ERG recordings, as described previously (Sokolov et al., 2002Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y. Massive light-driven translocation of transducin between the two major compartments of rod cells: a novel mechanism of light adaptation.Neuron. 2002; 34: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). After 10 min exposure to the 100 lux adapting light, Aadapted in the wild-type mice was reduced to less than 20% of Adark, indicative of light adaptation; in S74L/S74L mice, on the other hand, the reduction in Aadapted due to the 100 lux adapting light was much smaller (Figure 4D). This difference due to the S74L mutation was largely independent of the test flash intensity in the range of 0.005–0.05 relative to the saturating flash intensity (Figure 4D). When the intensity of the 10 min adapting light was raised to 250 lux, however, Aadapted/Adark even in S74L/S74L mice decreased significantly to a level almost identical to that of wild-type mice (Figure 4D). These results indicate that the S74L mutation markedly impairs light adaptation under the 100 lux light but not so much under a brighter light (250 lux). To explore the possible mechanism underlying the impaired light adaptation in S74L/S74L mice, we investigated immunohistochemically the light-dependent translocation of transducin (Hardie, 2002Hardie R. Adaptation through translocation.Neuron. 2002; 34: 3-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, Sokolov et al., 2002Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B.

In the dark-adapted state, both Tα and Tγ immunoreactivities were predominantly detected in the outer segment layer of wild-type and S74L/S74L retinas (Sokolov et al., 2002Sokolov M. Lyubarsky A.L. Strissel K.J. Savchenko A.B. Govardovskii V.I. Pugh Jr., E.N. Arshavsky V.Y.

After a 10 min exposure to the 100 lux adapting light, Tβγ in wild-type mice translocated to the inner regions of the photoreceptor layer, including the inner segment, the perinuclear region, and the synaptic terminal (Figure 5J). In contrast, in the S74L/S74L mouse retina, only a trace of Tγ immunoreactivity was detected in these inner regions after the 100 lux light adaptation (Figure 5M). In both mouse genotypes, minimal movement of Tα was observed under the same adaptation conditions (Figures 5D and 5G). With a 10 min exposure to a brighter (250 lux) light, the movement of Tβγ in wild-type retina was slightly more enhanced than under the 100 lux light (Figures 5K and 5P); in S74L/S74L retina, however, a large part of the Tβγ signals still remained in the outer segment layer (Figures 5N and 5P), a profile that is very similar to the distribution of wild-type Tβγ in the dark-adapted state (Figures 5I and 5P and Figure S4B). At 250 lux, Tα now showed considerable translocation to the inner region of the photoreceptor layer, and the localization profiles of Tα immunoreactivity were very similar in the two genotypes (Figures 5E and 5H). Quantitative analysis of these data (Figures 5O and 5P and Figure S4) supports that the translocation of Tβγ is markedly slowed down by the S74L mutation and that the light-dependent translocation of Tα is not affected by the mutation. We then asked whether geranylgeranylated Tβγ may be solubilized in vivo by the regulatory protein phosducin, which associates tightly with Tβγ and reduces its affinity for outer segment membranes (Lee et al., 1987Lee R.H.

We therefore hypothesize that phosphorylation of Y14 occurs upon completion of mRNA surveillance, leading to dissociation of Y14 from ribosome-containing mRNPs. Moreover, we found that Y14 is possibly methylated at multiple arginine residues in the carboxyl-terminal domain and that methylation of Y14 was antagonized by phosphorylation of RS dipeptides.

The splicing reaction removes introns from precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) 4The abbreviations used are: pre-mRNA, precursor mRNA; EJC, exon junction complex; HA, hemagglutinin; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; mRNP, mRNA ribonucleoprotein; MCP, MS2 coat protein; NMD, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay; PRMT1, protein arginine methyltransferase 1; SA, S166A/S168A; SRPK1, SR protein kinase 1. and positions the exon junction complex (EJC) on spliced mRNA in a sequence-independent manner (1Dreyfuss G.

Sci. 2003; 28: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The EJC is a dynamic multicomponent complex consisting of a heterodimer of Y14 with Mago and a number of associated factors (1Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 2Le Hir H. Nott A. Moore M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The EJC may be functionally connected to transcription and acts as an adaptor for recruiting factors involved in the RNA metabolism steps downstream of splicing (3Dimaano C. Ullman K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3069-3076Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previous work suggests that the EJC functions for the nuclear export of spliced mRNAs via the interaction of Y14/Mago, as well as other components, with the mRNA export receptor TAP (4Kim V.N. Yong J. Kataoka N. Abel L. Diem M.D. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2062-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G.

However, depletion of EJC components only marginally affects bulk poly(A)+ RNA export in cultured Drosophila cells (7Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), suggesting that the EJC may be an accessory factor for mRNA export. On the other hand, Y14/Mago and RNPS1, another EJC component, directly promote NMD-mediated mRNA degradation (8Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. Science. 2001; 293: 1832-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 9Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Y14 interacts with the NMD initiator Upf3 in the nucleus, which subsequently recruits other Upf proteins to yield the active NMD complex (1Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 2Le Hir H. Nott A. Moore M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Depletion of Y14 abolishes NMD, indicating its essential role in this pathway (10Gehring N.H. Neu-Yilik G. Schell T. Hentze M.W. Kulozik A.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recent reports show that the EJC promotes efficient translation by enhancing polysome association with mRNAs (11Wiegand H.L. Lu S. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11327-11332Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Nott A. Le Hir H. Moore M.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In particular, Y14/Mago, as well as RNPS1, is implicated in this translation enhancement (11Wiegand H.L. Lu S. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11327-11332Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Nott A. Le Hir H. Moore M.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 13Lu S. Cullen B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 618-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, the EJC participates in several post-splicing events, including mRNA export/surveillance and translation control (1Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 2Le Hir H. Nott A. Moore M.J. Trends Biochem.

The Y14/Mago heterodimer acts as a core that interacts with several key factors involved in the post-splicing mRNA metabolism pathways (15Bono F. Ebert J. Unterholzner L. Guttler T. Izaurralde E. Conti E. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Chan C.C. Dostie J. Diem M.D. Feng W. Mann M. Rappsilber J. Dreyfuss G. RNA (N.

Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The central region of Y14 contains a phylogenetically conserved RNA recognition motif in the central region that directly interacts with Mago (20Fribourg S. Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Lau C.K. Diem M.D. Dreyfuss G. Van Duyne G.D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 933-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of Y14 is rich in positively charged residues, and its function is not yet characterized. In particular, vertebrate Y14 proteins contain two consecutive arginine/serine (RS) dipeptides. Domains containing repeated RS dipeptides are characteristic of SR proteins that are primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing (22Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The RS domain is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions (22Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), which are directly impacted by the phosphorylation of this domain; hence, the activity, cellular localization, or stability of SR proteins can be modulated in this manner (22Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 23Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 613-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Tarn W.Y. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 937-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that the phosphorylation level of shuttling SR proteins changes during mRNP maturation (25Huang Y. Yario T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9666-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 26Lai M.C. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31745-31749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that RS domain phosphorylation/dephosphorylation governs mRNA export and perhaps subsequent events. In addition to the duplicated RS dipeptide, the carboxyl-terminal region of Y14 contains several arginine residues adjacent to glycines, reminiscent of RGG motif-containing hnRNP proteins (27Bedford M.T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 263-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Arginine methylation of these hnRNP proteins links transcription with mRNP formation and export (28Lukong K.E. Richard S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 914-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Methylation facilitates nuclear export by altering the interactions between factors involved in mRNA processing and export (29Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Xu C. Henry M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10742-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Yu M.C. Bachand F. McBride A.E. Komili S. Casolari J.M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, the two types of post-translational modification, namely phosphorylation and methylation, may coordinately modulate mRNP rearrangement during mRNA export. In this study we examined post-translational modifications of Y14. We found that Y14 can be phosphorylated and methylated in the carboxyl-terminal domain. Moreover, we examined how the phosphorylation of Y14 influences its protein-protein interactions, post-splicing functions, and methylation. Plasmids—The expression vector pcDNA-FLAG-Y14 was provided by Jens Lykke-Andersen (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO). Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal 23 amino acids of Y14 was made by PCR, and site-specific mutagenesis of Y14 was achieved using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). The cDNAs encoding wild-type and mutants of Y14 were each subcloned into pGEX-5X (Amersham Biosciences) to create vectors for expressing GST fusions. The FLAG-tagged Y14 SA mutant was directly generated from pcDNA-FLAG-Y14 by site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid pMCP was modified from pEGFP-N3 (BD Biosciences) in which the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) coding fragment was replaced by the sequence encoding the MS2 coat protein (MCP) (a gift of Kerry Bloom, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The cDNAs encoding Y14 or Upf3b were each inserted into pMCP to produce vectors for expressing MCP fusions. The TAP and Upf3b cDNA fragments were each cloned inframe with the HA tag into a modified pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen). The Y14 and Mago coding sequences were each inserted into pET15b and pET29b (Novagen), respectively, to create bacterial expression vectors for His-tagged proteins. The pGEX-SRPK1 vector was described previously (30Xu C. Henry M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10742-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and an analogous vector was constructed for expressing GST-Clk. In addition, the SRPK1 cDNA was subcloned into pET29b, yielding a plasmid used for Y14 phosphorylation in Escherichia coli. The vector for expressing GST fusion to rat PRMT1 was obtained from Wey-Jing Lin (Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan). Protein Purification and in Vitro Pull-down—GST fusion proteins, including Y14, SRPK1, Clk1, PRMT1, hnRNP A1, and the ASF RS domain, were overexpressed in E. coli strain BLR(DE3) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). To produce the recombinant Y14/Mago heterodimer, E. coli lysates containing either GST-Y14 or His-tagged Mago were combined and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h before sequential purification through glutathione-Sepharose 4B and His·Bind resin (Novagen). Purified GST-Y14 or a GST-Y14/His-Mago heterodimer was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm EGTA. To obtain in vivo phosphorylated GST-Y14, the expression vector encoding His-tagged SRPK1 was transformed into BL21(DE3) carrying pGEX-Y14. GST-Y14 was phosphorylated in vivo and purified as described above. For in vitro pull-down assays, prey proteins (32Li C. Lin R.-I. Lai M.-C. Ouyang P. Tarn W.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7363-7376Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were in vitro translated and 35S-labeled using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Antibodies—To raise anti-Y14 serum, His-tagged Y14 was overproduced in E. coli, recovered from inclusion bodies, and then used as antigen. Anti-phosphorylated Y14 serum was raised against eight copies of peptide Gly-Arg-Arg-Ser(P)-Arg-Ser(P)-Pro-Asp-Arg-Arg (where Ser(P) represents phosphoserine) that were linked by the multiple antigen peptide system (33Tam J.P. Spetzler J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 612-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To purify antibodies, antisera were incubated with nitrocellulose on which a non-phosphorylated (for anti-Y14) or phosphorylated (for anti-phosphorylated Y14) GST-Y14 protein was immobilized. Bound antibodies were eluted from the filters with a solution containing 50 mm glycine (pH 2.3) and 150 mm NaCl followed by neutralization. Anti-phosphorylated Y14 failed to detect or immunoprecipitate endogenous Y14, probably because of its low affinity. Anti-CBP and anti-ribosomal protein L22 were from Iain Mattaj (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) and Joan Steitz (Yale University, New haven, CT), respectively. Phosphorylation and Methylation—For in vivo phosphorylation, 3 × 106 transfected HeLa cells expressing FLAG-Y14 in a 100-mm-diameter plate were incubated in sodium phosphate-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.75 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) for 2.5 h. In vivo methylation was performed using five plates of HEK 293 cells that transiently expressed FLAG-Y14. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol for 30 min and subsequently labeled with 10 μCi/ml l-[methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) in methionine-lacking Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h. FLAG-tagged Y14 was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) used as recommended by the supplier. In vitro phosphorylation was performed as described (26Lai M.C. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31745-31749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For in vitro methylation, each 20-μl reaction contained 5 μg of substrate, 2.5 μgof GST-PRMT1, and 2-μCi of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. Oocyte Injection—Internally 32P-labeled PIP85 RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription. Xenopus laevis oocytes were maintained in Barth's solution containing 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 88 mm NaCl, 2.3 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm KCl, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin at 18 °C. For each oocyte, 60 ng of GST-Y14/His-Mago and 1 × 104 cpm (∼0.6 fmol) pre-mRNA were injected into the nucleus. After 45 min of incubation, lysates were prepared from 10–15 nuclei in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Pull-down of mRNPs from the lysates was performed using glutathione-Sepharose, and radiolabeled RNA was recovered from bound fractions for gel electrophoresis. NMD Assay—For the tethering NMD assay, HeLa cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1.5 μg each of pCPwtb2–6MS2 and pCPwtGAP3-UAC (gifts of Jens Lykke-Andersen) and 3 μg of pMCP-effector protein. At 24 h post-transfection, total RNA was prepared for Northern blotting analysis (9Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Y14 at the Duplicated RS Dipeptides—We first examined whether Y14 is phosphorylated at its duplicated RS dipeptides. FLAG-tagged Y14, either wild-type or double mutant S166A/S168A (abbreviated herein as SA; Fig. 1A), was transiently expressed in HeLa cells and metabolically labeled with 32P. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Y14 from cell lysates revealed that wild-type Y14 was indeed phosphorylated, whereas the SA mutant was barely labeled (Fig. 1B). Although phosphorylation at single or double RS sites was not directly addressed, this observation indicated that Y14 is a phosphoprotein and that the RS dipeptides serve as a major phosphorylation site. We next performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay to test whether Y14 is a substrate for SRPK1 or Clk1, two representative SR protein kinases. Both recombinant kinases phosphorylated an authentic RS domain derived from the splicing factor ASF, but only SRPK1 phosphorylated Y14 (Fig. 1C). Because Y14 exists as a heterodimer with Mago in vivo, we next examined whether this dimerization affects Y14 phosphorylation. A recombinant heterodimer comprising His-tagged Mago and a GST fusion to the wild-type or SA mutant of Y14 was produced in E. coli and purified by tandem affinity selection via the two tags (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2). The in vitro phosphorylation assay showed that SRPK1 phosphorylated the dimer containing wild-type Y14 but not that containing the SA mutant (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). A similar result was observed when in vitro phosphorylation was performed using HeLa cell subcellular fractions as the source of kinases (Fig. 1D, lanes 5–8). Although not directly demonstrated in vivo, these data indicated that the RS dipeptides of Y14 can be phosphorylated by SRPK1, an SR kinase present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Moreover, phosphorylation of Y14 can occur in the heterodimer context. Phosphorylation of Y14 Interferes with Its Interaction with EJC, mRNA Export, and NMD Factors—We next investigated whether phosphorylation of Y14 would affect its interaction with any known partners that function in mRNA export or NMD. To obtain phosphorylated recombinant Y14, GST-Y14 was coexpressed with SRPK1 in E. coli and subsequently copurified with His-Mago as a heterodimer (Fig. 2, section labeled Coomassie blue, lane 5). To evaluate phosphorylation efficiency, the prephosphorylated recombinant Y14/Mago heterodimer was further subjected to an in vitro phosphorylation assay. The result showed that 32P incorporation of prephosphorylated Y14/Mago was ∼70% lower than that of a non-phosphorylated dimer, suggesting that the majority of the RS sites were readily phosphorylated by SRPK1 in bacteria (data not shown). Phosphorylation of Y14 was also confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies against a Y14 peptide containing phosphorylated RS residues (Fig. 2, lane 5, row labeled anti-phos-Y14). Recombinant heterodimeric GST-Y14/His-Mago was used as bait to pull down in vitro translated REF, RNPS1, TAP, and Upf proteins. Y14/Mago directly interacted with all of these factors except RNPS1 (Fig. 2, lane 3) (5Kataoka N. Diem M.D. Kim V.N. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6424-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The heterodimer containing the SA mutant of Y14 bound to its partners as efficiently as the wild-type (Fig. 2, lane 4). Surprisingly, phosphorylated Y14/Mago had greatly reduced affinity to either the EJC or associated factors (Fig. 2, lane 5). However, the interaction of phosphorylated Y14/Mago with importin 13, the nuclear transport receptor for Y14 (34Mingot J.M. Kostka S. Kraft R. Hartmann E. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), argued against the possibility that phosphorylation severely disturbs the structure of Y14, thus precluding its binding to any partners. Therefore, phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of Y14 likely impaired its interactions with the EJC and EJC-associated factors. The Non-phosphorylatable Y14 Mutant Is Able to Incorporate into Post-splicing mRNPs and Activate NMD—Although the SA mutant of Y14 was not distinguishable from the wild-type with regard to interactions with other EJC factors, it was not clear whether the mutant has any post-splicing functions. To evaluate the association of Y14 with spliced mRNA, the recombinant GST-Y14/His-Mago heterodimer was co-injected with radiolabeled PIP85 pre-mRNA into Xenopus oocyte nuclei. At 45 min post-injection, tagged Y14/Mago was pulled down from nuclear extracts using glutathione-Sepharose. Y14/Mago associated primarily with the spliced mRNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4) as reported (4Kim V.N. Yong J. Kataoka N. Abel L. Diem M.D. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2062-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The SA mutant also bound to the spliced RNA as did the wild-type (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Moreover, the levels of spliced PIP85 mRNA in the cytoplasm were examined over a 2-h period post-injection. No significant difference was observed between the injection of GST and either form of Y14 (Fig. 3A, lower section, part labeled mRNA export). Therefore, the serine-to-alanine mutations within the RS repeat of Y14 affected neither the association of the EJC (containing Y14) with mRNA nor mRNA export. We next examined the activity of the Y14 SA mutant in NMD. We adopted a mRNA tethering system in which the NMD activity of a fusion protein containing the MCP is measured upon binding to a reporter mRNA containing repeated MS2 sites downstream of the stop codon (9Lykke-Andersen J. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). An expression vector encoding MCP and HA doubly tagged Y14 was cotransfected into HeLa cells along with two vectors, one for the MS2-containing NMD reporter (β6MS2) and another encoding a control mRNA (βG) (Fig. 3B, upper section). As observed with the NMD initiator protein Upf3b, tethering of either the wild-type or the SA mutant of Y14 significantly reduced the level of β6MS2 RNA (Fig. 3B, lower section). Therefore, the SA mutation had no detectable effect on the capability of Y14 to activate NMD. Moreover, when overexpressed the mutant Y14 promoted NMD of a nonsense-containing mRNA as efficiently as the wild-type protein (data not shown), suggesting no dominant negative effect with the SA mutant. The Non-phosphorylatable Y14 Mutant Sequesters Downstream Factors—Although Y14 appeared to be phosphorylated at the RS dipeptides, the non-phosphorylatable Y14 behaved similarly to the wild-type protein with regard to both its association with the EJC (which, in turn, binds to spliced mRNA) and participation in NMD activation (Figs. 2 and 3). Therefore, phosphorylation might occur after Y14, along with several EJC factors, is exported to the cytoplasm and accomplishes mRNA surveillance. Nevertheless, phosphorylation of Y14 prevented its interaction with the EJC and downstream factors in vitro (Fig. 2). We thus hypothesized that phosphorylation triggers dissociation of export or NMD factors from Y14 and/or removes Y14 from ribosome-containing mRNPs. If phosphorylation is blocked, Y14-containing complexes might accumulate. To test this hypothesis, a FLAG-tagged wild-type or SA mutant of Y14 was transiently co-expressed with the mRNA export factor TAP or the NMD factor Upf3b in HEK 293 cells. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG showed that higher levels of TAP or Upf3b were co-precipitated with the SA mutant as compared with wild-type Y14 (Fig. 4, lanes 1–6). NMD takes place in polysomes containing the cap-binding protein CBP20/80 rather than eIF4E during a pioneer run of translation (35Lejeune F. Ishigaki Y. Li X. Maquat L.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3536-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Using specific antibodies, we detected CBP80 and ribosomal protein L22 (Fig. 4, lanes 7–12) but not eIF4E (data not shown) in the Y14 mutant immunoprecipitates. Consistent with our idea, this result indicated that non-phosphorylated Y14 bound more tightly with NMD factors and the pioneer translation machine than did phosphorylatable Y14. Phosphorylation of Y14 Interferes with Its Arginine Methylation—The notion that Y14 contains potential arginine methylation sites within the carboxyl-terminal domain prompted us to examine its possibility. HEK 293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-Y14 were incubated with l-[methyl-3H]methionine or l-[35S]methionine in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG showed that Y14 was labeled only with 3H (Fig. 5A) but not with 35S (data not shown), indicating that Y14 was post-translationally methylated in cells. Like hnRNP A1, Y14 can be methylated in vitro by recombinant rat PRMT1, a type I arginine methyltransferase (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 3). Truncated Y14 lacking the carboxyl-terminal 23 residues was poorly labeled, suggesting that methylation occurred primarily at the carboxyl-terminal arginines (Fig. 5B, lane 4). To more accurately determine the methylation sites, we made several arginine-to-lysine point mutations within the carboxyl-terminal region of Y14. In vitro methylation using PRMT1 occurred primarily at six arginines, including four (Arg-159, Arg-160, Arg-163, and Arg-164) immediately adjacent to glycine residues and two (Arg-165 and Arg-167) within the RS dipeptide repeat (Fig. 5C). Moreover, Y14, when in the heterodimer with Mago, could be methylated albeit with slightly lower efficiency than the Y14 monomer (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Because the phosphorylation and methylation sites are proximal, modification of one type may preclude that of the other. Indeed, RS dipeptide phosphorylation severely hampered methylation at the carboxyl terminus of Y14 (Fig. 5D). We did not address the question of whether methylation has a reciprocal effect on phosphorylation, because the data could be misinterpreted given that recombinant proteins have a lower efficiency of methylation (data not shown). In conclusion, Y14 can be phosphorylated and methylated at its protruding carboxyl terminus; these modifications may modulate the function of Y14 and may act antagonistically. In this study we provide evidence that Y14 is subject to phosphorylation and methylation at its carboxyl-terminal domain. These post-translational modifications may provide a layer of regulation that controls the activity of Y14. At present, it is not known at which steps of mRNA biogenesis or subcellular locations these modifications take place. However, our present data allow the simple speculation that hypophosphorylated Y14 recruits the EJC and downstream-acting factors to the spliced mRNA in the nucleus and that phosphorylation of Y14 occurs after initial runs of translation of the mRNA in the cytoplasm to dissociate the NMD complex (Fig. 6). Perhaps, like hnRNP proteins, Y14 is methylated in the nucleus for remodeling or export of its associated mRNPs We discuss these possibilities below. It is plausible that phosphorylation of Y14 modulates its activity; however such modification appears to be dispensable for Y14 with regard to its association with spliced mRNA and activation of NMD (Fig. 3). Moreover, no dominant negative effect was detected with the non-phosphorylatable mutant of Y14 either on mRNA export in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2) or on NMD of nonsense transcripts (data not shown). Nevertheless, the in vitro binding assay showed that phosphorylated Y14 does not interact with its partners that act downstream in the RNA metabolism pathway (Fig. 2). Accordingly, non-phosphorylatable Y14 appeared to be sequestered in ribosome-containing mRNP together with export- and NMD-related factors (Fig. 4). Y14 is present in ribosome-associated mRNP fractions as it functions in mRNA surveillance and is subsequently removed from mRNAs by active translation (36Dostie J. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1060-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, upon the completion of mRNA surveillance, phosphorylation of Y14 may trigger its dissociation from ribosome-containing mRNPs and, hence, from other interacting partners (Fig. 6). Such RNP remodeling may be hampered if Y14 fails to be properly phosphorylated, leading to prolonged association of Y14 as well as NMD factors with polysomes (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the exact mechanism by which the function of Y14 is regulated through phosphorylation needs further investigation. The observation that the mRNA export adaptor TAP preferentially interacted with non-phosphorylated Y14 is reminiscent of shuttling SR proteins. SR proteins join pre-mRNAs for splicing probably in a hyperphosphorylated form (23Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 613-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Shuttling SR proteins that function as export adaptors for mRNA bind directly to TAP (37Huang Y. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 837-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that dephosphorylation of SR proteins takes place during pre-mRNA splicing or subsequent steps for recruiting TAP (25Huang Y. Yario T.A. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9666-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 26Lai M.C. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31745-31749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known whether dephosphorylation of SR proteins is a prerequisite for nuclear export of mRNAs. Nevertheless, our present data indicated that not only authentic SR proteins but also the EJC component Y14 recruits TAP for export in a hypophosphorylated form. Therefore, dephosphorylation is probably common for RS repeat-containing export adaptors, thereby providing a signal to the export machinery for exit from the nucleus. Finally, we found that Y14 can be methylated and that this methylation is abrogated by prior phosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 5). It is evident that arginine methylation of several yeast hnRNP proteins facilitates their export from the nucleus, probably by modulating the assembly of export complexes (29Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Xu C. Henry M.F. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2024-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, methylation of hnRNP proteins may not necessitate hnRNP complex formation in higher eukaryotes (38Pawlak M.R. Banik-Maiti S. Pietenpol J.A. Ruley H.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and thus the role of methylation in mRNA export remains elusive. Further experiments should address whether methylation modulates the interactions of Y14 with its partners, thereby further specifying Y14 functions. Interestingly, Y14, like the yeast RNA-binding protein Npl3p (39Gilbert W. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 201-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), shares properties with SR proteins and hnRNP proteins with regard to post-translational modifications. Thus, mRNP rearrangement and export in higher eukaryotes might be modulated through modification of Y14. We thank J. Lykke-Andersen, K. Bloom, W.-J. Lin, I. Mattaj, and J.

Although both ARF1 and ARF6 were found on peroxisomes, coatomer recruitment only depended on ARF1-GTP. Recruitment of ARF1 and coatomer to peroxisomes was significantly affected both by pretreating the animals with peroxisome proliferators and by ATP and a cytosolic fraction designated the intermediate pool fraction depleted of ARF and coatomer. In the presence of ATP, the concentrations of ARF1 and coatomer on peroxisomes were reduced, whereas intermediate pool fraction led to a concentration-dependent decrease in ARF and increase in coatomer. Brefeldin A, a fungal toxin that is known to reduce ARF1 binding to Golgi membranes, did not affect ARF1 binding to peroxisomes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both ScARF1 and ScARF3, the yeast orthologs of mammalian ARF1 and ARF6, were implicated in the control of peroxisome proliferation.

The intracellular communication of peroxisomes with other subcellular compartments is only poorly explored. Questions such as how peroxisomes accept their membrane phospholipids or distribute their ether lipid precursors are still unanswered.

Recently, it was shown that the ER is implicated in the biogenesis of peroxisomes (1Titorenko V.I. Rachubinski R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 231-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Geuze H.J. Murk J.L. Stroobants A.K. Griffith J.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Koster A.J. Verkleij A.J. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2900-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex3p, an integral peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP) was demonstrated to first assemble in the ER before budding in a Pex19p-dependent manner (3Hoepfner D. Schildknegt D. Braakman I. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Cell. 2005; 122: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). On the other hand, fusion of distinct precursor vesicles to generate functional peroxisomes was suggested, although it is not clear from which membrane these precursor vesicles are derived (4Titorenko V.I. Smith J.J. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 32: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence experiments in mammalian cells have shown that under appropriate conditions, PMPs segregate into membrane patches and proliferate, involving dynamin-like protein 1 (DLP1). This member of the dynamin family of large GTPases was recently localized to yeast and mammalian peroxisomes, and expression of a dominant negative mutant inhibited peroxisomal division (5Hoepfner D. van den Berg M. Philippsen P. Tabak H.F. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 979-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 6Koch A. Thiemann M. Grabenbauer M. Yoon Y. McNiven M.A. Schrader M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17012-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying these intercommunicative processes are not clear; however, they might include the generation and fusion of vesicles. In this context, the observation is of great interest that isolated peroxisomes recruit ARF and the COPI coat complex (coatomer) from the cytosol. Peroxisomal coatomer recruitment was dependent on GTP and sensitive to protease pretreatment of the organelles (8Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Anton M. Passreiter M. Lay D. Thai T.P. Gorgas K. Just W.W. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 32: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). ARF-dependent coatomer recruitment plays a dominant role in Golgi transport processes (10Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Binding of ARF and coatomer to peroxisomes thus may indicate that peroxisomes are functionally linked to another cellular compartment, in order to enable transport and exchange of materials. ARF molecules are widely implicated in membrane traffic within eukaryotic cells functioning in processes of the secretory pathway (10Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 11Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the endocytic transport mediating recruitment of the COP I coat and the clathrin adaptor proteins AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4. Whereas the COP I coat is involved in both the retrograde Golgi to ER and the anterograde Golgi transport, AP-1 and AP-4 are recruited to the trans-Golgi network and AP-3 to endosomal membranes (see Refs. 13Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar and 14Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Besides vesicular transport, ARF1 seems also to be implicated in the assembly of apolipoprotein B-containing very low density lipoproteins by activating phospholipase D and in regulating in its GDP-bound state the association of adipocyte differentiation-related protein to lipid droplets (15Asp L. Claesson C. Boren J. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26285-26292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Nakamura N. Akashi T. Taneda T. Kogo H. Kikuchi A. Fujimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 957-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There may be still other processes implicating ARF molecules, since in mammals six ARF subtypes occur, and to date the role of many of them is not really understood (17Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, by comparison, three ARF subtypes exist (17Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19Li Y. Kelly W.G. Logsdon Jr., J.M. Schurko A.M. Harfe B.D. Hill-Harfe K.L. Kahn R.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1834-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ScARF1 and ScARF2 functionally complement each other in regulating Golgi transport, whereas the role of ScARF3 that is neither implicated in Golgi transport nor essential for viability (20Lee F.J. Stevens L.A. Kao Y.L. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20931-20937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) still remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we further explored peroxisomal ARF and coatomer binding. Our results demonstrate that (i) ARF-GTP binding to peroxisomes in vitro is essential for subsequent binding of coatomer, (ii) it is the subtype 1 of ARF that favors coatomer recruitment, (iii) ARF and coatomer binding is affected by ATP and a cytosolic factor but is not inhibited by brefeldin A (BFA), and (iv) besides ARF1, ARF6 is also found on peroxisomal membranes. Utilizing various ARF mutants of the yeast S. cerevisiae, we show that ScARF1 is essential for oleate-induced peroxisome proliferation and that deletion of ScARF3, the yeast ortholog of mammalian ARF6, significantly stimulates proliferation. The results suggest that ARF1 is essential for coatomer recruitment to peroxisomes and that, besides ARF1, ARF6 may also be involved in the control of peroxisomal processes. Materials—AMP-PNP, GMP-PNP, and GDPβS were purchased from Sigma, and ATP and creatine kinase were from Roche Applied Science. Creatine phosphate was from Calbiochem. Antibodies—ARF1- and ARF6-specific antibodies were raised in rabbits. For ARF1C1 antibody, animals were injected with the C-terminal peptide of ARF1 (CDWLSNQLRNQK) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma). ARF6C1 antibody was raised against the C-terminal peptide CGLTWLTSNYKS of ARF6. The antibody 2048 raised against recombinant ARF1 (21Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and recognizing different ARF isotypes was a gift from Dr. Bernd Helms (Utrecht University, The Netherlands). Unless otherwise stated, ARF1C1 and ARF6C1 were used to detect ARF1 or ARF6, respectively. Polyclonal antibody specific for β′COP (22Harter C. Pavel J. Coccia F. Draken E. Wegehingel S. Tschochner H.

Mouse monoclonal anti-GM130 was purchased from BD Biosciences, and monoclonal mouse anti-HA (HA.11, clone 16B12) was from Babco. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing peroxisomal proteins were raised in rabbits. The anti-PMP36 antibody recognizes a 36-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein. The anti-PMP69 and anti-Pex11αp antibodies were described elsewhere (8Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies anti-mouse peroxidase and anti-rabbit peroxidase were from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Isolation of Subcellular Fractions—Cytosol and peroxisomes were isolated from rat liver of either control or clofibrate-treated (0.5% clofibrate added to the chow for 5–7 consecutive days) male Wistar rats. Animals were starved 16 h before the preparation. Cytosol was prepared according to Ref. 8Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar. Briefly, all steps were carried out at 4 °C. Livers from six rats were collected in buffer H (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.55, 165 mm KOH, 2 mm MgAc2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μm leupeptin, 10 μm antipain, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and a homogenate (1:10) was prepared. After removing nuclei and mitochondria (10 min at 6,000 × g), the supernatant was subjected to centrifugations at 100,000 × g for 60 min followed by 180,000 × g for 90 min (TFT 55.38-rotor; Kontron Instruments, Hanau, Germany). The resulting supernatant was concentrated about 10-fold in a MINITAN ultra concentration unit (molecular weight cut-off 10,000; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). The concentrated cytosol was finally cleared at 100,000 × g for 60 min and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. The cytosol had a final concentration of 45–50 mg/ml. Fractionation of stimulated cytosol was performed on a Superdex 200 column (HiLoad XK 16/60; Amersham Biosciences) in buffer H applying 2 ml of cytosol, collecting 20 fractions of 4 ml each. The coatomer- and ARF-containing fractions were identified by Western blotting. Pooled fractions were concentrated to a final volume of 500–800 μl using the Vivaspin 20 units according to the manufacturer's protocol (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany) to obtain the coatomer pool fraction (CPF), the intermediate pool fraction (IPF) and the ARF pool fraction (APF), respectively. Highly purified peroxisomes were isolated as described previously (23Hartl F.U. Just W.W. Koster A. Schimassek H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The isolated peroxisomes usually had a concentration of 2.5–3.5 mg/ml and were stored in small aliquots at –80 °C. Rat liver Golgi was prepared according to Ref. 24Brugger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W.D. Nickel W. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar and was kindly provided by Dr. Britta Brügger (Universität Heidelberg, Germany). Overexpression of Recombinant ARFs—Recombinant myristoylated human ARF1 was purified to near homogeneity according to Ref. 25Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar and was a kind gift from Dr. Felix Wieland (Universität Heidelberg, Germany). Overexpression of recombinant myristoylated and C-terminally HA-His-tagged versions of mouse ARF1 and ARF6 (26Hosaka M. Toda K. Takatsu H. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (subcloned in pET20b) was performed using the same protocol. The expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Kazuhisa Nakayama (University of Tsukuba, Japan). To purify the expressed proteins, cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 μm GDP, 1 μm MgCl2) supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Applied Science), cleared for 5 min at 500 × g, 4 °C, and finally lysed using an Emulsi-Flex-C5 (Avestin Inc., Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell debris and insoluble material were removed at 18,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min. Supernatant was adjusted to 1 mm MgCl2 and cleared at 180,000 × g and 4 °C for 90 min. The resulting supernatant was slowly adjusted to 300 mm NaCl and loaded onto 10 ml of Ni 2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Superflow (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Unbound material was removed (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μm GDP, 20 mm imidazol), and the bound protein was eluted using an imidazol gradient (100–300 mm imidazol in the same buffer). Recombinant ARF eluting at 170–190 mm imidazol was pooled, concentrated 2–3-fold (Vivaspin 20/molecular weight cut-off 5,000; Vivascience, Hannover, Germany), dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm GDP, and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. The final concentration of recombinant myristoylated ARF1-HA-His and ARF6-HA-His was 1–2 mg/ml of protein. Incubation of Peroxisomes and Golgi—Peroxisomes were incubated with cytosol as described in Ref. 8Passreiter M. Anton M. Lay D. Frank R. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Gorgas K. Just W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, applying slight modifications. Peroxisomes were resuspended in sucrose buffer (10 mm glycylglycin, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) at a concentration of 1.25 mg/ml, and cytosol was added in a 40–50-fold excess of protein over peroxisomes. For incubations with cytosolic fractions, the protein amount was calculated equivalently, and the volume was topped up with buffer H. Incubations were carried out in the presence of a 50–100 μm concentration of either GMP-PNP or GDPβS. Unless otherwise mentioned, all incubations were done in the presence of an ATP regenerating system (ARS) containing 2 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 250 μg/ml creatine kinase. GMP-PNP, GDPβS, and ARS were prepared as 40-fold stocks in 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5. The organelles were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and reisolated after 30 min on ice and washing in sucrose buffer (10 min, 15,000 × g, 4 °C). Incubations with recombinant ARF proteins were done in the same way, by incubating 50 μg of peroxisomes with 1 μg of the ARF protein. CPF was used at a concentration equivalent to 2 mg of complete cytosol. Incubations of Golgi membranes were done essentially as described for peroxisomes, except for stripping the Golgi membranes (300 mm KCl in sucrose buffer) prior to incubation, in order to remove bound ARF and coatomer. Incubations with BFA were done according to Ref. 27Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar. The organelles were preincubated with 160 μm BFA for 10 min at 37 °C. BFA was dissolved in methanol (8 mm). Controls were performed by adding an equal amount of the solvent, the final methanol concentration in all assays not exceeding 2% (v/v). After adding 50 μm GMP-PNP and the appropriate amount of APF, the incubation was continued for 20 min at 37 °C. All samples were floated up through 43% (w/v) Nycodenz, the organelles were reisolated, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Lipid Determination—The phospholipid (PL) content of isolated peroxisomes and Golgi was determined as described (24Brugger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W.D. Nickel W. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry and Edman Sequencing—Peroxisomal membranes were prepared by carbonate treatment (28Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar) and incubated with APF and GMP-PNP as described above for intact peroxisomes. Samples were treated with 1 m KCl for 30 min on ice, and the membranes were reisolated by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in sample buffer and run on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The protein band of 20 kDa was excised from the gel (stained with Coomassie R-250), digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) on a Reflex II spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonic, Bremen, Germany). Alternatively, the excised protein band was digested in gel using Asp-N (Roche Applied Science), and the peptides obtained were separated by HPLC. Distinct peptides were analyzed by Edman sequencing as described previously (29Heid H.W. Moll R. Schwetlick I. Rackwitz H.R. Keenan T.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 294: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Yeast Strains and Culture Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in TABLE ONE. Unless otherwise stated, strains without plasmids were grown in complete YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), whereas strains containing plasmids were selected on SD minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids. Standard growth temperature was 25 °C. Sporulation, tetrad dissection, and scoring of genetic markers were performed as described (30Sherman F.

Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SSY145 (arf1-wt, arf2Δ) and SSY146 (arf1-ts, arf2Δ) were kindly provided by Dr. Stephan Schröder-Köhne (Würzburg, Germany). SCMIG631 (arf3Δ) was obtained by substituting the chromosomal ARF3 open reading frame with LEU2 marker in SCMIG22. SCMIG561 (arf1-ts, arf2Δ, arf3Δ) was obtained by crossing strain SCMIG631 to SSY146, diploids were selected and sporulated, tetrads were dissected, and segregants were scored for the appropriate markers. To visualize the peroxisomal compartment, cells were transformed with a GFP construct containing a C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (GFP-PTS1). For transformation of SSY145 and SSY146, the plasmid pRS315 was used. Whereas SCMIG22, SCMIG631, PC70 (32Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P.

Oleic acid-induced peroxisome proliferation was performed by growing the preculture to late log phase in SD medium. Subsequently, the cells were kept continuously in the log phase for 3 × 6 h by repeated inoculations and growth of the cultures. For the temperature shift experiments, the appropriate strain was transferred to the restrictive temperature (35 °C) 30 min prior to incubations in the oleic acid-containing medium. The precultured cells were transferred to temperature-equilibrated YNO medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% (w/v) oleic acid, 0.02% (w/v) Tween 40, amino acids as required) and grown for 6 h at the temperature indicated.TABLE ONEGenotypes of S. cerevisiae strains used in these experiments Name Strain Genotype Source arf1-wt, arf2Δ SSY145 MATa ARF1, arf2::URA3, ura3, leu2, lys2, bar1, his3 S.

Trends Biotechnol. 1990; 8: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar) and immediately analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS SP (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). For each viewing field, nine consecutive layers were taken together with the brightfield image. The brightfield image and the layers 3, 5, and 7 were merged, and the numbers of both cells and peroxisomes were determined. For each condition tested, at least 200 cells were analyzed to calculate the average number of peroxisomes per cell. Specificity of ARF Binding to Isolated Rat Liver Peroxisomes—Several peroxisomal membrane proteins including Pex11αp are increased in concentration more than 10-fold by eliciting peroxisome proliferation. This process implicating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α is induced by a series of drugs and rather specifically affects the peroxisomal compartment (35Yu S. Rao S. Reddy J.K. Curr. Mol. Med. 2003; 3: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We investigated ARF and coatomer binding using preparations of highly purified peroxisomes and cytosol from proliferation-stimulated and -unstimulated rat livers (Fig. 1). Binding of ARF and coatomer, visualized with antibodies specific for ARF and β′COP, was strictly dependent on GTP and did not occur with GDP. Irrespective of the use of stimulated or unstimulated cytosol that both contained the same amounts of ARF and coatomer (Fig. 1A), stronger ARF binding was observed on stimulated than on unstimulated peroxisomes (Fig. 1B). In contrast to that, about double the amount of coatomer was recruited from stimulated compared with unstimulated cytosol, irrespective of the stimulation state of the peroxisomes. Although the amount of Pex11αp was much higher in stimulated than in unstimulated peroxisomes, the amount of PMP22p, a peroxisomal marker not induced by peroxisome proliferators, was the same in all assays, demonstrating equal amounts of peroxisomes applied. Care was taken in these experiments to avoid artifactual precipitation of cytosolic proteins in the absence of organelles that easily occurred in the assays containing GTPγS or GMP-PNP. For that reason, prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, peroxisomes were recovered by flotation instead of pelleting. ARF1-dependent recruitment of coatomer is a process highly active in the Golgi apparatus (10Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 36Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 37Roth M.G.

Cell. 1999; 97: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of Golgi membranes from the peroxisomal preparation is critical. In order to assess the Golgi content of our peroxisome preparation, we analyzed ARF and coatomer binding in parallel to both peroxisomes and rat liver Golgi membranes (Fig. 2). In each assay, comparable amounts of membranes were analyzed based on their phospholipid rather than protein content. From the results of these experiments, we concluded that (i) the GMP-PNP-dependent ARF and coatomer binding to Golgi is dependent on the amount of membranes; (ii) compared with peroxisomes, Golgi membranes recruit about half the amount of ARF but double the amount of coatomer; (iii) Golgi, but not peroxisomal membranes, consistently recruit small but significant amounts of coatomer also in the presence of GDPβS. GM130, a Golgi matrix protein and putative vesicle docking receptor (39Short B. Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R311-R313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a Golgi marker to monitor Golgi contamination in the isolated peroxisome fraction. Even after prolonged exposition of the blot (Fig. 2, last line), no GM130 signal was recognized in the peroxisome preparation. Identification of the ARF Subtype Recruited to Peroxisomal Membranes—By mass spectroscopic analysis, we determined which of the six ARF subtypes is recruited to peroxisomal membranes. We analyzed the binding of cytosolic ARF to untreated peroxisomes or to peroxisomes treated with either 1 m KCl or 100 mm carbonate. These treatments should minimize matrix and peripherally attached membrane proteins that could interfere with the mass spectroscopic analysis of the bound ARF proteins. As seen in Fig. 3A, the high salt and high pH treatment did not noticeably affect ARF and coatomer binding, and therefore carbonate membranes were used in the following experiment. ARF- and coatomer-containing cytosol fractions were obtained by separating rat liver cytosol by gel chromatography into three main fractions designated CPF, IPF, and APF (Fig. 3B). Following incubation with APF, peroxisomes were recovered, washed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Coomassie-stained polypeptides were digested in gel using either trypsin or Asp-N cleavage, and the isolated peptides were analyzed by MALDI-MS or HPLC separation and Edman sequencing. The peptide masses and sequences obtained are listed in TABLES TWO and THREE. Due to the high sequence homology within the ARF subtypes, many peptide sequences, as indicated in TABLE TWO, matched more than one subtype. However, five peptide sequences were"
https://openalex.org/W2048766616,"The techniques of high applied pressure and flash photolysis have been combined to study ligand rebinding to neuroglobin (Ngb) and tomato Hb, globins that may display a His-Fe-His hexacoordination in the absence of external ligands. High pressure induces a moderate decrease in the His association rate and a large decrease in His dissociation rate, thus leading to an enhancement of the overall His affinity. The overall structural difference between penta- and hexacoordinated globins may be rather small and can be overcome by external modifications such as high pressure. Over the pressure range 0.1-700 MPa (7 kbar), the globins may show a loss of over a factor of 100 in the amplitude of the bimolecular rebinding phase after photodissociation. The kinetic data show that pressure induces a moderate increase of the rate for ligand binding from the correlated pair state (just after photodissociation) and a large (factor of 1000) decrease in rate for migration through the protein. The effect on the ligand migration phase was similar for both the external ligands (such as oxygen) as for the internal (histidine) ligand, suggesting the dominant role of protein fluctuations, rather than specific chemical barriers. Thus high pressure efficiently closes the protein migration channels; however, contrary to the effect of high viscosity, high pressure induces a greater decrease in rate for ligand migration toward the exterior (heme to the solvent) versus inward migration, as if the presence of the ligand itself induces an additional steric constraint."

During embryogenesis and tumorigenesis mammalian mitochondria use a folate-dependent pathway to generate both glycine and one-carbon units to support cytoplasmic purine synthesis (1Christensen K.E.

One of the enzymes in this pathway, the NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase (NMDMC), 5The abbreviations used are: NMDMC, NAD-dependent methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase; methylene-THF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; formyl-THF, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate; DCS, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase; DC, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase; GR, glutathione reductase; DH, dehydrogenase; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type. catalyzes the interconversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (methylene-THF) and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-THF) in mammalian mitochondria. The mitochondrial formyl-THF is converted to formate by a monofunctional formyl-THF synthetase and is released to the cytoplasm for reconversion into formyl-THF to support purine biosynthesis (1Christensen K.E. Patel H. Kuzmanov U. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NMDMC can use both NAD and NADP as a cofactor in its dehydrogenase activity, although the maximal activity with NADP is only about twenty percent of that with NAD (3Yang X.-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NMDMC is thought to have evolved from a trifunctional NADP-dependent methylene-THF dehydrogenase-methenyl-THF cyclohydrolase-formyl-THF synthetase (DCS) through the loss of the synthetase domain and the change in cofactor specificity from NADP to NAD (4Patel H. Christensen K.E. Mejia N. MacKenzie R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 403: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This change in cofactor specificity is important because the use of NAD rather than NADP in mitochondria shifts the equilibrium of the reaction to favor the production of formyl-THF (5Pelletier J.N. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12673-12680Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The increased production of formyl-THF is required to meet the demand for glycine and purines during embryogenesis (1Christensen K.E. Patel H. Kuzmanov U. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Patel H. Di Pietro E. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 4158-4166Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how this cofactor specificity change was accomplished. NMDMC is unique in its absolute requirement for magnesium and inorganic phosphate ions for NAD-dependent dehydrogenase activity and magnesium ions for NADP-dependent dehydrogenase activity (3Yang X.-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Rios-Orlandi E.M. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4662-4667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither ion is essential for the cyclohydrolase activity. The role of these ions in the dehydrogenase activity is not clear. The sequence of binding of the cofactors and substrates to NMDMC, as established kinetically by Yang and Mackenzie (3Yang X.-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Rios-Orlandi and MacKenzie (7Rios-Orlandi E.M. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4662-4667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggests a role for Pi and Mg2+ in the binding of the cofactor; the ions bind to the protein first, followed by NAD and then the folate substrate. A preferred order of binding of the ions was not established; either ion appears to be able to bind to the enzyme and affect the binding of the other. These results suggested a possible interaction between the two ions in the binding site. The observation that Pi competitively inhibits the cofactor in NADP-dependent dehydrogenase assays of NMDMC led to the proposal that Pi may occupy a position adjacent to the 2′-hydroxyl of NAD, close to the space that would be occupied by the 2′-phosphate of NADP (3Yang X.-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previous work on the DC domain of the human NADP-dependent DCS identified two residues (Arg173 and Ser197) as being important to the binding of NADP to the enzyme through its 2′-phosphate (8Pawelek P.D. Allaire M. Cygler M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of mitochondrial NAD-DCs with trifunctional NADP-DCSs suggest that Arg166 and Arg198 (numbered from the amino-terminal glutamate of the mature enzyme) may interact with Pi (9Pawelek P.D. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). The crystal structure of the DC domain of the human NADP-dependent DCS has been determined both with bound NADP and with bound NADP and folate analogues (10Allaire M. Li Y. MacKenzie R.E. Cygler M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6325-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The structure of the Escherichia coli NADP-dependent DC has been determined by x-ray crystallography in the absence of bound substrates (12Shen B.W. Dyer D.H. Huang J.-Y. D'ari L. Rabinowitz J.

Breska A. Ernst S. Appling D.R. Robertus J.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1374-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, since no crystal structure of NMDMC has yet been obtained, we constructed a homology model of the enzyme based on three related structures and used this to locate the Pi and Mg2+ binding sites using site-directed mutagenesis. Materials—(R,S)-tetrahydrofolate was synthesized according to the method of Drury et al. (14Drury E.J. Bazar L.S. MacKenzie R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and stored in sealed glass vials at 4 °C. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was obtained from Qiagen. Vent DNA polymerase was obtained from New England Biolabs, and restriction enzymes were products of New England Biolabs and MBI Fermentas. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Sigma Genosys, Qiagen Operon, and Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. NAD, imidazole, and rifampicin were purchased from Sigma. (R,S)-methenyltetrahydrofolate was obtained from B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Bioshop or BDH and were of analytical grade. Construction of the Homology Model of Human NMDMC—Crystal structures for three NMDMC homologues have been determined. The DC domain of the human NADP-dependent DCS structure has been solved with NADP (10Allaire M. Li Y. MacKenzie R.E. Cygler M. Structure (Camb.). 1998; 6: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and with NADP and three different folate analogues (11Schmidt A. Wu H. MacKenzie R.E. Chen V.J. Bewly J.R. Ray J.E. Toth J.E. Cygler M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6325-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The E. coli NADP-dependent DC structure has been solved in the absence of ligands (12Shen B.W. Dyer D.H. Huang J.-Y. D'ari L. Rabinowitz J. Stoddard B.L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1342-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae NAD-dependent dehydrogenase has been solved both without ligands and in complex with NAD (13Monzingo A.F. Breska A. Ernst S. Appling D.R. Robertus J.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1374-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Templates with bound cofactors and substrates were selected to build a holoenzyme model of human NMDMC. The three template structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB): the DC domain of the human NADP-dependent DCS in complex with NADP and a folate analogue (PDB ID: 1DIB), the E. coli NADP-dependent DC (PDB ID: 1B0A), and the S. cerevisiae NAD-dependent dehydrogenase in complex with NAD (PDB ID: 1EE9). Although the sequence similarity among these proteins is not particularly high as the pair-wise percent identity ranges between 22-43%, the three-dimensional structures are highly homologous (see Fig. 1). A multiple sequence alignment of the target and template sequences was generated using ClustalW (15Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56228) Google Scholar). The alignment was then refined to include structural data using alignments to the 1DIB structure generated using a brute force structural alignment method followed by iterative cycles of improvement as implemented in the program Lsqman (16Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Structural elements for the model were selected from the templates by highest sequence identity to NMDMC. The structural elements from the aligned templates were linked together and the side chains mutated using the computer program O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar and Fig. 1), lacks structural data and was not included in the final structure. The position of Asp190 suggested that it could play a role in the cofactor binding site, so it was included in the model, and its position was determined by local energy minimization using CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). The loop from residue 244 to 252 is disordered in the 1DIB structure and is not present in the E. coli and S. cerevisiae enzymes. This loop has been shown not to be required for DH activity or cofactor binding (20Sundararajan S. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18703-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and so was not included in the model. The geometry and stereochemistry of the model structure was optimized using CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). For the optimization residues 243 and 253 were fixed to keep their position homologous to the 1DIB structure. NAD, Pi, and NADP were docked into the model based on the position of the cofactors in the template structures. The crystal structures 1B0A and 1EE9 show only one monomer of the enzymes and so the resulting model showed only one monomer of NMDMC, which is known to be a dimer (21Mejia N.R. Rios-Orlandi E.M. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9509-9513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To model the dimer two copies of the model were superimposed on the 1DIB structure using Lsqman (16Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 842-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), and the geometry and stereochemistry of the side chains along the dimer interface was optimized using CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar). The quality of the model was evaluated at every step using Procheck (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Pictures of the model were generated using Pymol (23DeLano W.L. The Pymol Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Addition of Six-histidine Tags—To simplify purification a COOH-terminal six-histidine tag was added to NMDMC by PCR using primers including the 3′ terminus of the required coding region of the cDNA, the sequence of the tag and an XhoI site. The histidine-tagged cDNA was then subcloned into pBKeHB1 (24Murley L.L. Mejia N.R. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22820-22824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to make pBKeHB1 303H6. The six-histidine tag replaces an unstructured tail made up of twelve residues that have no influence on enzyme activity. The kinetic constants and activities of 303H6 are identical to the full-length, non-histidine-tagged NMDMC (data not shown), and so the histidine tag does not interfere with the enzyme function. The truncated version of the protein was selected for this study because it had better expression levels than full-length NMDMC with six histidines added and to circumvent any problems that may arise from having the six-histidine tag added to the mobile unstructured tail. For simplicity, in the results section 303H6 is referred to as wild type, meaning unmutated pBKeHB1 303H6. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced into pBKeHB1 303H6 using in vitro overlap extension PCR as in Sundararajan and MacKenzie (20Sundararajan S. MacKenzie R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18703-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The entire insert of the resulting vector was sequenced by automated sequencing (Genome Québec) to confirm the integrity of each mutant. All of the mutants in this study should affect the NAD(P) cofactor binding and thus only the dehydrogenase activity, leaving the cyclohydrolase activity and folate substrate binding kinetic constants as controls for gross disruptions of the protein structure. All of the mutants reported in this study retained significant cyclohydrolase activity. There were no significant differences between the Km values for methylene-THF, with either NAD or NADP as the cofactor, or for methenyl-THF for any of the mutants. This shows that there are no gross disruptions of the protein structure in the mutants and that the folate substrate binding site is unaffected by these mutations. Protein Expression and Purification—pBKeHB1 303H6 constructs expressing histidine-tagged NMDMC were transformed into E. coli BL21 DE3. Overnight cultures of transformed bacteria were used to inoculate 100 ml of Terrific Broth supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. Expression was induced when cultures reached an A600 1.0 to 1.2 by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 2 mm. After 30 min 15 μg/ml rifampicin was added to inhibit host translation. Cells were harvested after an additional 90 min by centrifugation for 20 min at 4000 rpm at 4 °C in a Sorvall RC-3. Pellets of ∼0.3 to 0.4 g cells were stored at -85 °C. Frozen pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 10 ml of sonication buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.3), 35 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Resuspended cells were disrupted by sonication on ice using 10-12 pulses of 10 s each separated by intervals of 1 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,500 rpm at 4 °C in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 20 min. Protamine sulfate (0.1 volume of 10 mg/ml solution) was added to the supernatant, followed by an additional 20-min centrifugation at 12,500 rpm. The protamine sulfate-treated crude extract was adjusted to contain 0.5 m NaCl and 15 mm imidazole and added to 10 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA-agarose resin in binding buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 0.5 m NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The slurry was mixed for 1.5 h at 4 °C on a rotator, and the resin was collected by centrifuging at 1,000 rpm for 10 min in a Sorvall RC-3. The resin was then resuspended in 5 ml of binding buffer and packed into a 1.5-cm diameter column. The column was washed once at 0.25 ml/min with 3 volumes of binding buffer, followed by 3 volumes of binding buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. The enzyme was eluted at 0.1 ml/min with binding buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the enzyme were identified by Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar). All enzyme preparations were evaluated for purity by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay performed in triplicate, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Enzyme Assays and Kinetics—Dehydrogenase assays were performed after Yang and Mackenzie (3Yang X.-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Pawelek and MacKenzie (26Pawelek P.D. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Standard conditions buffer contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.3), 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.3), 5 mm magnesium chloride, 2.5 mm formaldehyde, 0.2 mm (6R,S)-tetrahydrofolate, 36 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.6 mm NAD. For NADP-dependent DH assays the assay mixture was modified by removing the potassium phosphate and NAD and including 2 mm NADP. Standard activity assays are reported as the average of three separate determinations performed in triplicate using a single fixed time point. The determination of kinetic constants was performed on mutants with sufficient activity using a multiple time point assay as in Schmidt et al. (11Schmidt A. Wu H. MacKenzie R.E. Chen V.J. Bewly J.R. Ray J.E. Toth J.E. Cygler M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6325-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), typically using four time points at 2-min intervals and at least five variable substrate concentrations. Cyclohydrolase assays were performed as described in Pawelek and MacKenzie (26Pawelek P.D. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1109-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with 5 mm magnesium chloride added to the buffer. Results reported are the average of three separate determinations done in triplicate. The determination of kinetic constants was done as for the standard cyclohydrolase assay, using at least five methenyl-THF concentrations. For enzymes with sufficient activity, initial rate data were fitted to the Michealis-Menten equation by non-linear regression using Sigmaplot (Systat Software Inc.). The kinetic constants for Mg2+ with NAD as a cofactor were determined in the same manner by fitting to the Hill equation. Standard errors of the fit for Km and Vmax were under 25%. Results are reported as the average and standard deviation of three to five separate Km determinations. Inhibition of NADP-dehydrogenase activity by Pi was examined by performing assays at four fixed Pi concentrations at varying concentrations of NADP, similar to Yang and MacKenzie (3Yang X.-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ki values for Pi against NADP were calculated from the intercepts of replots of the slopes of Lineweaver-Burk plots versus Pi concentration. The homology model of NMDMC is in good agreement with the template structures. The root mean square deviation of the α carbons between the model and each template is as follows: 1DIB structure (human DCS), 1.23 Å; 1B0A structure (E. coli DC), 0.92 Å; and 1EE9 structure (S. cerevisiae D), 1.40 Å (see Fig. 1). The Ramachandran plot of the model demonstrates that 82.6% of residues are in core regions, 14.6% in allowed regions, and 2.8% in generously allowed regions. No residues are found in disallowed conformations. A ribbon diagram of the homology model, shown with docked Pi and NAD, is shown in Fig. 2. The coordinates for the model have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 1ZN4. The competitive inhibition of Pi against NADP in dehydrogenase assays lead Yang and MacKenzie (3Yang X.-M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11118-11123Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to propose that Pi binds to NMDMC in a position analogous to the location of the 2′-phosphate of NADP in DCS. The NAD binding site of the NMDMC model is shown compared with the NADP binding site of DCS in Fig. 3. The Pi modeled in the NMDMC structure is slightly displaced from NAD into a positively charged cavity made up of Arg166 and Arg198. Three of the Pi oxygens are now within hydrogen bonding distance (2.5-3.5 Å) of the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyls of the NAD ribose. Arg166 and Arg198 are homologous to Arg173 and Ser197, respectively, of the human DCS, which are involved in NADP binding (8Pawelek P.D. Allaire M. Cygler M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Arg173 of DCS forms multiple hydrogen bonds with and stabilizes the charge of the 2′-phosphate of NADP (10Allaire M. Li Y. MacKenzie R.E. Cygler M. Structure (Camb.). 1998; 6: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When this residue is mutated, dehydrogenase activity of DCS is reduced to less than 2.5% of wild-type activity, and values of Km for NADP are greatly increased, showing the importance of this residue in binding the cofactor (8Pawelek P.D. Allaire M. Cygler M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the homology model (Fig. 3) Arg166 appears to have the potential to form multiple hydrogen bonding interactions with Pi and can also contribute to stabilizing the charge of Pi, similar to the role of Arg173 in DCS. Therefore this residue was targeted for mutagenesis. Ser197 of the human DCS forms one hydrogen bond with the 2′-phosphate of NADP (10Allaire M. Li Y. MacKenzie R.E. Cygler M. Structure (Camb.). 1998; 6: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and was shown by mutagenesis to play a supporting role in cofactor binding (8Pawelek P.D. Allaire M. Cygler M. MacKenzie R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1479: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In NMDMC (Fig. 3) Arg198 is the homologous residue to Ser197 of DCS. In the homology model of NMDMC it appears that this residue has the potential to form hydrogen bonds with Pi and can also contribute to charge stabilization and so it too was targeted for mutagenesis. Upon examination of the model, the side chain of Asp190, a residue unique to NMDMC, was observed behind Arg166 in a position that suggests an electrostatic interaction (Fig. 3). Mutation of this residue provides the opportunity to manipulate the position of Arg166 in the protein and observe the effects, without actually changing the nature of the side chain. Mutagenesis of Arg166—Even conservative mutations of Arg166 abrogate dehydrogenase activity (TABLE ONE). This is consistent with the role of Arg173 in DCS. Arg173 is primarily responsible for NADP binding through the 2′-phosphate, which suggests that Arg166 has a similar role in binding Pi in NMDMC.TABLE ONEDehydrogenase activity of Arg166 mutantsEnzymeSpecific activity (% WT)NAD-DHNADP-DHμmol min−1 mg−1WT22.5 ± 1.1 (100)2.92 ± 0.06 (100)R166ANDaND = not detectable (<0.01 μmol min−1 mg−1).NDR166SNDNDR166KNDNDa ND = not detectable (<0.01 μmol min−1 mg−1). Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis of Asp190—To examine the effects of changing the position of Arg166 without altering the side chain Asp190 was mutated. The assay results are shown in TABLES TWO and THREE. Mutations of this residue that disrupted the ionic interaction of Asp190 and Arg166 (such as D190A and D190S) or resulted in a shift of the position of Arg166 in the binding site (D190E) resulted in the loss of DH activity. Only D190N retained significant amounts of DH activity with both cofactors. This mutant would have a weaker interaction between residues 166 and 190, allowing greater movement of Arg166, but the position of Arg166 would not shift due to the similar size of the Asp and Asn side chains. The affinity of D190N for Pi, as measured by its inhibition constant against NADP, is not changed although all values of Km for substrates and ions are elevated. These changes in the Km values most likely reflect the inhibition of DH activity due to the difficulty of positioning the ligands properly in the binding site when Arg166, and therefore Pi, are free to move. The increase in the Mg2+ constants suggests that the Mg2+ and Pi binding sites, like the NAD and Pi binding sites, interact with each other. The Km for NADP is less affected than that for NAD, because the 2′-phosphate is covalently attached and requires positioning of a single ligand rather than two separate molecules. Binding NADP might help to partially reposition Arg166 in the D190N mutant. These mutations show that the role of Asp190 is to position Arg166 in the binding site.TABLE TWODehydrogenase activity of Asp190 mutantsEnzymeSpecific activity (% WT)NAD-DHNADP-DHμmol min−1 mg−1WT22.5 ± 1.1 (100)2.92 ± 0.06 (100)D190ANDaND = not detectable (<0.01 μmol min−1 mg−1).NDD190SNDNDD190E0.024 ± 0.001(0.1)NDD190N3.64 ± 0.03 (16)3.96 ± 0.07 (136)a ND = not detectable (<0.01 μmol min−1 mg−1).

https://openalex.org/W2159540841,"Binding of an agonist to the 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor family of the glutamate receptors (GluRs) results in rapid activation of an ion channel. Continuous application results in a non-desensitizing response for agonists like kainate, whereas most other agonists, such as the endogenous agonist (<i>S</i>)-glutamate, induce desensitization. We demonstrate that a highly conserved tyrosine, forming a wedge between the agonist and the N-terminal part of the bi-lobed ligand-binding site, plays a key role in the receptor kinetics as well as agonist potency and selectivity. The AMPA receptor GluR2, with mutations in Tyr-450, were expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and characterized in a two-electrode voltage clamp setup. The mutation GluR2(Y450A) renders the receptor highly kainate selective, and rapid application of kainate to outside-out patches induced strongly desensitizing currents. When Tyr-450 was substituted with the larger tryptophan, the (<i>S</i>)-glutamate desensitization is attenuated with a 10-fold increase in steady-state/peak currents (19% compared with 1.9% at the wild type). Furthermore, the tryptophan mutant was introduced into the GluR2-S1S2J ligand binding core construct and co-crystallized with kainate, and the 2.1-Å x-ray structure revealed a slightly more closed ligand binding core as compared with the wild-type complex. Through genetic manipulations combined with structural and electrophysiological analysis, we report that mutations in position 450 invert the potency of two central agonists while concurrently strongly shaping the agonist efficacy and the desensitization kinetics of the AMPA receptor GluR2."

Apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase (AATYK) is up-regulated during the LK-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of wild-type AATYK, but not its kinase-deficient mutant, stimulates apoptosis in LK. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the phosphorylation states of AATYK and the survival of granule cells. AATYK was hypophosphorylated in HK, whereas it was hyperphosphorylated in apoptotic LK. HK-dependent hypophosphorylation of AATYK was controlled by L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel-mediated Ca2+ influx followed by Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase activity. However, LK-induced hyperphosphorylation of AATYK at multiple sites was blocked by kainate, lithium, and protein kinase C-δ inhibitor. AATYK phosphorylation was concurrent with c-Jun phosphorylation. In addition, mutations of AATYK on either the kinase domain or Ser-480, Ser-558, and Ser-566 residues suppressed the LK-induced hyperphosphorylation and apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of self-kinase activity and these Ser residues in this process.

Apoptosis is observed not only in neurodegenerative diseases, but also in the normal development of the nervous system. Neurons that are supplied with survival factors (e.g. neurotrophic factors), or synaptic activity through their proper synaptic connections mature and survive during neuronal development. Neurons without synaptic connections are eliminated by apoptosis or undergo programmed cell death because of the absence of these survival factors (1Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev.

Apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase (AATYK) was found to be up-regulated during the apoptosis of myeloid precursor cells induced by IL-3 deprivation (17Gaozza E. Baker S.J. Vora R.K. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3127-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We showed that AATYK is enriched in mouse brains and was also up-regulated during CGC apoptosis induced by low K+ concentrations (18Tomomura M. Fernandez-Gonzales A. Yano R. Yuzaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is notable that the molecular mass of the AATYK protein on SDS-PAGE showed a slight increase at 3 h after switching to LK, although the protein expression level was only slightly increased compared with the rapid increase in mRNA level. We previously reported that AATYK is tyrosine-phosphorylated and has in vitro kinase activity (18Tomomura M. Fernandez-Gonzales A. Yano R. Yuzaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the AATYK family also possesses Ser/Thr kinase activity (19Wang H. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49605-49612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Kawa S. Fujimoto J. Tezuka T. Nakazawa T. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Treatment with protein tyrosine phosphatase partly reduced this LK-induced molecular shift (18Tomomura M. Fernandez-Gonzales A. Yano R. Yuzaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, the number of apoptotic CGCs overexpressing exogenous AATYK in LK was higher than that of CGCs overexpressing the kinase domain mutant that lacks the self-kinase activity. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying AATYK-associated CGC apoptosis. On the other hand, AATYK promotes the neurite elongation of young CGCs, suggesting that AATYK has dual functions dependent on its developmental stage (21Tomomura M. Hasegawa Y. Hashikawa T. Tomomura A. Yuzaki M. Furuichi T. Yano R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 112: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To clarify the AATYK-associated CGC apoptosis, we investigated the phosphorylation of AATYK under survival (HK) and apoptotic (LK) conditions. We found that AATYK is hypophosphorylated in HK but is hyperphosphorylated in LK. The HK-induced hypophosphorylation state depends on the depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling pathway, whereas the LK-induced hyperphosphorylation state is partly attributed to self-kinase activity. This study suggests that the switching between these two phosphorylation states regulates CGC survival and apoptosis. Chemicals—The chemicals were purchased from the following sources. SB203580, PD98059, LY294002, Z-VAD, roscovitine, BAPTAAM, nimodipine, FK-506, A23187, (–)-BayK8644, rottlerin, staurosporin, herbimycin A, and genistein were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); nifedipine, AMPA, NMDA, DNQX, NBQX, and APV were from Tocris Cookson (Ballwin, MO). Kainic acid, thapsigargin, N-acetylcysteine, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), lithium chloride, 2-propylpentanoic acid, sodium salt (sodium valproic acid), rottlerin, and myo-inositol were from Sigma. KN62 was from Seikagaku-kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Cyclosporin A and ω-conotoxin were from Wako Pure Chemicals Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Cell Culture—Primary cultures of CGCs were prepared from mice on postnatal day 7 as described previously (22Kurschner C. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7770-7780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CGCs were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 and grown on poly-l-lysine-coated plates in an HK medium, neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 25 mm KCl, 1 mm glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). To induce apoptosis, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 5 mm KCl (LK) and B27 after 7 days of culture in HK. Measurement of Cell Viability—The mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity that reduces 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) in active mitochondria to purple formazan was used to determine cell survival. The cells were incubated with MTT (0.2 mg/ml) for 60 min, then solved with lysis buffer (50% N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide, 10% SDS, 20% acetic acid) for 30 min at 37 °C. The amount of formazan was quantified spectroscopically at λ570. Cell viability was also assessed by nuclear morphology by staining with DAPI (Vectashield, Burlingame, CA). Western Blot Analysis—The cells in a 24-well plate were extracted from an SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Applied Science)). The samples were resolved by 2–15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% Tween 20, followed by incubation with the primary antibodies of rabbit anti-peptide (CGPAAGAGGRYTEA) AATYK antibody, anti-c-Jun, anti-phospho-c-Jun Ser-63/73 (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-Akt Ser-473, anti-p38, anti-phospho-p38 Thr180/Tyr182, anti-JNK, and anti-phospho-JNK Thr183/Tyr185 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) and detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of Plasmids Encoding AATYK and Expression—The cDNAs encoding the FLAG-tagged C-terminal deletion mutant of AATYK were generated by PCR using full-length mouse AATYK cDNA in pCAGGS (18Tomomura M. Fernandez-Gonzales A. Yano R. Yuzaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis of AATYK was conducted by PCR using complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing specific mutation. After digesting the parental DNA with Dnp 1, the PCR products were transformed into Escherichia coli. The clones were isolated, and the sequences were verified. The expression vectors were transfected by the calcium-phosphate method as previously described (18Tomomura M. Fernandez-Gonzales A. Yano R. Yuzaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with the following slight modification: the calcium-DNA precipitations were incubated with cells for 30 min at 2.5% CO2. Analysis of Apoptotic Cells Overexpressing AATYK—The expression vectors for FLAG-tagged AATYK and green fluorescent protein (ratio, 3:1) were co-transfected into CGCs as described previously (18Tomomura M. Fernandez-Gonzales A. Yano R. Yuzaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, apoptosis was induced by switching the medium to LK. Seventeen hours later, the cells were stained by the anti-FLAG and DAPI. Transfected cells expressing GFP and/or AATYK were assessed for apoptosis by nuclear morphology (pyknotic nuclei) as described previously (18Tomomura M. Fernandez-Gonzales A. Yano R. Yuzaki M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of AATYK Protein after Switching from High to Low KCl—To gain insight into the AATYK signaling cascade, we focused on the molecular changes in AATYK protein during LK-induced CGC apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 1A, the mobility shift of the AATYK protein band to the more slowly migrating position on SDS-PAGE was detected as early as 30 min after switching from the HK to the LK culture medium. Treatment with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase or bacterial alkaline phosphatase before electrophoresis inhibited this LK-induced molecular shift, indicating that LK induced AATYK phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). In addition, calf intestine or bacterial alkaline phosphatase treatment caused the AATYK protein to migrate to a lower molecular weight position even in HK compared with that without calf intestine or bacterial alkaline phosphatase treatment, indicating that AATYK in HK is also phosphorylated. In this study, we thus defined AATYK in HK and LK as hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated AATYK, respectively. L-type Voltage-dependent Ca2+ Channels Mediate the Hypophosphorylation of AATYK in CGCs Cultured in HK—To elucidate the determinant(s) of the phosphorylation state of AATYK in HK and LK, we examined the effects of various pharmacological reagents on the molecular shift of AATYK on SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment with extracellular Ca2+ chelator EGTA (5 mm) in HK did shift the AATYK band up to the LK-induced position, although there was no change in the banding position in LK. These data suggest that the intracellular Ca2+ level under HK culture conditions regulates the hypophosphorylation state of AATYK. To determine whether the hypophosphorylated state of AATYK in HK is mediated via Ca2+ signaling, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of reagents that influence the intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in CGCs (Fig. 1D). Treatment with BAPTA-AM (intracellular Ca2+ chelator), gargin (inhibitor of ER Ca2+ thapsi-ATPase), and ω-conotoxin (antagonist of N-type VDCCs) did not affect the AATYK banding pattern in HK and LK. In contrast, nifedipine (antagonist of L-type VDCCs) induced the molecular shift in HK as did EGTA, but showed no effect in LK. Neither A23187 (Ca2+ ionophore) nor BayK8644 (agonist of L-type VDCCs) affected LK-induced-phosphorylation (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that Ca2+ influx through L-type VDCCs is involved in the HK-induced hypophosphorylation of AATYK but not LK-induced hyperphosphorylation. AATYK Hypophosphorylation in HK Is Mediated by Ca2+-dependent Protein Phosphatase Activity—To further characterize the Ca2+ signal-mediated hypophosphorylated state of AATYK in HK, we examined the effects of reagents that influence Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation in CGCs. Treatment of CGCs with KN62 (inhibitor of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) in HK caused the AATYK band to shift up to the position induced by nimodipine (L-type VDCC inhibitor) in HK or to the position induced in LK on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), whereas it had no effect on the mobility of AATYK in LK. Similarly, treatment with cyclosporin A (inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin) changed the hypophosphorylated position primarily in HK to the hyperphosphorylated position similar to that in LK. Cyclosporin A did not have any effect on the LK-induced molecular shift. These results suggest that the Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway mediated via Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin is involved in HK-induced AATYK hypophosphorylation but not in LK-induced AATYK hyperphosphorylation. AATYK Hyperphosphorylation in LK Is Inhibited by Treatment with the Glutamate Receptor Agonist Kainate and the PKC-δ Inhibitor Rottlerin—Because VDCC-mediated Ca2+ influx affected the HK-induced hypophosphorylation but not the LK-induced hyperphosphorylation of AATYK, we analyzed the contribution of glutamate receptors, another pathway for the Ca2+ influx in CGCs. Treatment with kainate (KA) in LK suppressed the switching of AATYK from hypophosphorylation state to hyperphosphorylation state in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Although KA blocked the LK-induced molecular shift, it did not affect the banding pattern in HK. An additional AATYK band was detected between the band positions in HK and LK depending on the dose of KA (e.g. at 100 μm KA in Fig. 2B), indicating that AATYK in LK is hyperphosphorylated in at least two more sites than AATYK in HK. Neither AMPA nor NMDA showed a change in this molecular shift (Fig. 2C). Moreover, simultaneous treatment with DNQX or NBQX (blockers of AMPA/KA receptors), but not APV (blocker of NMDA receptors), released the suppression of LK-induced hyperphosphorylation by KA (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that the KA receptor activity possibly regulates the AATYK phosphorylation states. We next examined the effects of other kinase inhibitors (Fig. 2E). Rottlerin (specific inhibitor of Ca2+-independent and diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase C-δ isoform, PKC-δ) blocked the LK-induced AATYK molecular shift (Fig. 2E), suggesting that PKC-δ is involved in the signaling mechanism underlying the LK-induced AATYK hyperphosphorylation. The conventional PKC inhibitor, Go6976, on the other hand, did not affect it (data not shown). Staurosporine (a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor) showed a slight inhibitory effect at 100 nm. Genistein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) induced no change. None of the treatments of CGCs with p38 kinase inhibitor (10 μm; SB203580), Cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 inhibitor (10 μm; roscovitine), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (20 μm; PD98059), or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (10 μm; LY294002) affected the molecular position of AATYK in either HK or LK (data not shown). Lithium Inhibits LK-induced AATYK Phosphorylation—We next analyzed the effects of apoptosis-related reagents on the differential phosphorylation states of AATYK. The widely used mood-stabilizing drugs lithium and valproic acid (VAP) have been shown to confer neuroprotection against apoptotic stimuli (23D'Mello S.R. Anelli R. Calissano P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Grignon S. Levy N. Couraud F. Bruguerolle B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 315: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Ciani E. Rizzi S. Paulsen R.E. Contestabile A. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Treatment with lithium in LK blocked the LK-induced mobility shift of AATYK in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, VAP had no significant effect on AATYK phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). None of the treatments of CGCs with caspase inhibitor (20 μm; Z-VAD), antioxidant (5 mm; N-acetyl l-cysteine), or IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) affected the molecular position of AATYK in either HK or LK (data not shown). AATYK Phosphorylation Is Concurrent with c-Jun Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun, an immediate-earlygene, is closely associated with CGC apoptosis (9Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed a possible correlation between c-Jun and AATYK in terms of apoptosis-associated phosphorylation (Fig. 4). LK induced an increase in the amount of phosphorylated c-Jun, as did AATYK. Treatment with nimodipine and KN62 in HK increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun, whereas treatment with kainate, rottlerin, and lithium in LK inhibited it. Cyclosporin A in HK also induced the phosphorylation of both c-Jun and AATYK (data not shown). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of AATYK coincides with that of c-Jun during the LK-induced apoptosis of CGCs. AATYK Phosphorylation Is Associated with CGC Apoptosis—To study the functional relevance of AATYK phosphorylation and CGC apoptosis, we assayed cell viability by DAPI staining and under culture conditions that influence the phosphorylation states of AATYK (Fig. 5). CGCs undergoing apoptosis in LK conditions display characteristic chromatin condensation, allowing identification by DAPI staining as shown in Fig. 5A. The number of CGCs showing this apoptotic nuclear morphology increased in the presence of nimodipine in HK. In the presence of nimodipine in HK, AATYK reverted to the hyperphosphorylated state primarily in LK as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. On the other hand, lithium treatment in LK reduced the number of apoptotic CGCs. The same conditions (LK plus lithium) reversed the phosphorylation states from hyper- to hypophosphorylated as shown in Fig. 3. These results suggest that the phosphorylation states of AATYK are closely associated with CGC apoptosis. Next, we quantified cell viability by MTT assay at 24 h after treatment with the agents that affected AATYK phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Fifty to 60% of CGCs became apoptotic in the LK medium, as previously reported (22Kurschner C. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7770-7780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with nimodipine, KN62, and Cyclosporin A reduced the survival rate of CGCs in HK in a dose-dependent manner, whereas these treatments did not have an effect in LK at the same doses. On the other hand, kainate, rottlerin, and lithium protected CGCs from LK-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that AATYK phosphorylation states correlate with HK-induced survival and the LK-induced apoptosis of CGCs. AATYK Is Phosphorylated at Multiple Sites—AATYK was hyperphosphorylated at multiple sites under LK culture conditions. We examined whether the self-kinase activity of AATYK is involved in LK-induced hyperphosphorylation. FLAG-tagged full-length recombinant AATYK proteins (AATYK-wt) (Fig. 6A) exogenously expressed in CGCs were phosphorylated under LK conditions (Fig. 6B). However, kinase-deficient AATYK (AATYK-mc), which has a point mutation at the catalytic site (Asp-206 to Val, D206V), did not show an LK-induced molecular shift (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the kinase activity of AATYK itself is essential for LK-induced phosphorylation. To determine the LK-induced phosphorylation sites, we generated a series of C-terminal truncation mutants with (wt) and without (mc) kinase activity (Fig. 6A). When the full-length AATYK (1,317 amino acid residues) was expressed in 293T cells, the molecular size of wild-type AATYK-wt was larger than that of the kinase-deficient AATYK-mc (Fig. 6C). Treatment with phosphatase led to the same mobility in both constructs (data not shown); the difference in the mobility observed is therefore dependent on self-kinase activity. By utilizing this property, we screened the C-terminal truncation constructs (up to the 1184, 883, 625, 537, 465, and 360 residues) for phosphorylation candidate sites (Fig. 6, B and C). As a result, the molecular shift disappeared by deleting up to the 465th residue. Interestingly, the kinase-active wt series of more than 625 residues showed multiple banding patterns in comparison with the kinase-deficient mutant counterparts (mc): i.e. single in AATYK-537-wt versus -mc, double in AATYK-625-wt versus -mc, and more than double in AATYK-883-wt versus -mc. These results indicate that AATYK has at least two phosphorylation sites, one located between residues 465 and 537 and the other between residues 537 and 625. Although AATYK-883-wt seemed to have more than two bands, the kinase-deficient AATYK-883-mc also showed two bands. Taken together, these results suggest that two candidate sites within residues 465–625 are phosphorylated by AATYK kinase activity, whereas other potential sites are phosphorylated by the intrinsic kinases of 293T cells other than AATYK. There are four phosphorylation candidate sites (Ser-480, Tyr-487, Ser-558, and Ser-566) among the 471–600 residues (Fig. 7A) of AATYK (predicted by software, Prosite and NetPhos). We generated seven substitution mutants of AATYK-625 (S480G, Ser-480 to Gly; S480A, Ser-480 to Ala; S480D, Ser-480 to Asp; Y487F, Tyr-487 to Phe; Y487D, Tyr-487 to Asp; S558A, Ser-558 to Ala; S566A, Ser-566 to Ala) and analyzed the molecular shift of these constructs expressed in the 293T cells (Fig. 7). The control, AATYK-625-wt, expressed in the 293T cells showed three bands; the upper band (third band) was major, the middle band (second band) was minor, and the lower band (first band) was barely detectable (Fig. 7B). In the mutants S480G and S480A, the second band became major instead of the third band. The mutant Y487F showed a similar banding pattern to that of S480G and S480A. These results suggest that the efficiency of phosphorylation at one of the two phosphoryla"

However, little is known about the trafficking of its receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily. In the present study, we examined the effect of ligand on the endogenous “long” isoform of the prolactin receptor in breast cancer cells. We found that prolactin caused rapid and prolonged down-regulation of this receptor. The prolactin-induced increase in degradation was blocked by inhibitors of both proteasomes and lysosomes. However, the ubiquitin-conjugating system was not required for internalization. Prolactin also resulted in the concomitant appearance of a cell-associated prolactin receptor fragment containing the extracellular domain. This latter process required proteasomal, but not metalloprotease, activity, distinguishing it from ectodomain “shedding” of other membrane receptors, which are secreted as binding proteins. The prolactin receptor fragment was labeled by surface biotinylation and independent of protein synthesis. Together, these data indicated that prolactin binding initiates limited proteasomal cleavage of its receptor, generating a cell-associated fragment containing the extracellular domain. Our findings described a new potential mediator of prolactin action and a novel mechanism whereby proteasomes modulate cellular processes.

It also participates in numerous other processes, including behavior, metabolism, immune function, and osteogenesis (for reviews, see Refs. 1Goffin V. Binart N. Touraine P. Kelly P.A. Annu. Rev.

Although the kinase cascades and alterations in gene expression that are initiated by PRL binding to its receptors have received considerable study (for reviews, see Refs. 3Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V.

However, the so-called “long” isoform (lPRLR), which transmits the most signals, is the best-studied. Ligand binding to the lPRLR initiates internalization (6Genty N. Paly J. Edery M. Kelly P.A.

Although PRL has been observed to either up- or down-regulate its receptor in complex in vivo systems, exogenous PRL reduced receptor levels in more defined experimental systems in vitro, a process blocked by inhibitors of lysosomal function (for review, see Ref. 10Kelly P.A. Djiane J. Postel-Vinay M.-C. Edery M. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 235-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Recently, PRL was reported to increase PRLR interaction with SCFβ-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase, increasing PRLR ubiquitination and thereby destabilizing the receptor (11Li Y. Suresh Kumar K.G. Tang W. Spiegelman V.S. Fuchs S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4038-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the role of ubiquitination in ligand-stimulated PRLR endocytosis and proteasomes in receptor down-regulation was not examined.For several membrane receptors, including the closely related growth hormone receptor (GHR), ligand binding has been shown to initiate proteolytic cleavage(s) of the receptor (for reviews, see Refs. 12Baumann G.

In some cases, receptor fragments have been reported intracellularly, where they can potentially serve as signaling molecules (for reviews, see Refs. 13Ni C.Y. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Carpenter G.

Mammary epithelial cells are exposed to both circulating PRL as well as endogenously synthesized PRL, which is particularly prominent in primates (for review, see Ref. 4Clevenger C.V. Furth P.A. Hankinson S.E. Schuler L.A. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This local synthesis complicates the study of ligand-induced responses in experimental in vitro systems and also increases PRLR expression (26Gutzman J.H. Miller K.K. Schuler L.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 88: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), convoluting studies of membrane receptor trafficking subsequent to ligand binding. We have derived cell lines from MCF-7 breast cancer cells that are deficient in endogenous PRL production (27Schroeder M.D. Symowicz J. Schuler L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), permitting us to examine the effect of exogenous ligand on endogenously expressed lPRLR in clinically relevant target cells rather than transiently transfected model systems. Here we have demonstrated that proteasomal activity is critical for the PRL-initiated dramatic lPRLR down-regulation and generation of a PRLR fragment containing the ECD, although the ubiquitin-conjugating system is not required for internalization. This fragment was derived from surface lPRLR and was not dependent on translation, consistent with post-internalization processing of the lPRLR. Our findings showed the importance of the proteasomal system in mediating ligand effects on the lPRLR and suggest a novel mechanism for PRL signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Recombinant human PRL (lot AFP9042) was obtained through the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Parlow. Bovine PRL (U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) bPRL B-1, AFP 5300) was obtained from the Animal Hormone Program of the USDA Reproduction Laboratory (Beltsville, MD), and recombinant bovine placental lactogen was a gift from the Monsanto Co.

All inhibitors and culture media were purchased from Sigma with these exceptions: lactacystin and bisindolylmaleimide II and γ-secretase inhibitor IX (Calbiochem) and matrix metalloproteinases inhibitor GM6001 (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA).Plasmids—The expression plasmid for the human long PRLR isoform was a gift from C. Clevenger (29Kline J.B. Roehrs H. Clevenger C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35461-35468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). MT123 (HA-Ub) (30Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) was used to assess receptor-associated ubiquitination. The HA epitope, YPYDVPDYA, was introduced between the signal peptide and the first amino acid of the mature bovine lPRLR as follows. First, 30 cycles of PCR were used to synthesize two fragments overlapping with the HA sequence: Fragment 1, starting from a unique 5′ EcoRI site through the signal peptide, ending with the HA tag with two oligonucleotides, 5′-GTGCTGGAATTCCGGGCAAATG-3′, 5′-GGCGTAATCGGGCACGTCATAGGGGTATCCATTCAGAAGGCTGACAC-3′; Fragment 2, starting with the HA tag followed by the first amino acid of the mature PRLR to the unique BstEII site with two other oligonucleotides, 5′-TACCCCTATGACGTGCCCGATTACGCCCAGTCACCTCCTGAAAAACC-3′, 5′-GGATGCAGGTCACCATGCTA-3′. Second, five cycles of PCR supplied with dNTPs were used to anneal and fill the ends of the two fragments. Third, 25 cycles of PCR supplied with two outside oligonucleotides containing unique sites were used to amplify the whole fragment. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BstEII and then substituted into the wild-type PRLR with the same restriction enzymes.MCF-7 and NIH-3T3-F442A Cell Culture—PRL-deficient cells derived from the human mammary adenocarcinoma cell line, MCF-7, were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% horse serum and 50 μm ganciclovir as reported previously (27Schroeder M.D. Symowicz J. Schuler L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3-F442A cells were a gift from Dr. P. Bertics; these cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For some experiments, 106 cells/60-mm plate were incubated in serum-free medium or serum-free medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (MCF-7 and 3T3-F442A, respectively), for 24-48 h prior to treatments. Cells were then pretreated with vehicle or inhibitor for 30 min or 1 h followed by the addition of vehicle, 4 nm PRL, or 1 μg/ml 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for an additional incubation. In some experiments, media were harvested, floating debris were removed by centrifugation, and protein was precipitated by incubation with 3 volumes of acetone at -20 °C.Ubiquitination—To examine ubiquitin associated with the PRLR, 3.9 × 106 Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with the HA-Ub expression vector together with the human lPRLR expression plasmid using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). Cells were grown in serum-free media overnight after the removal of transfection reagent and then treated with or without 4 nm PRL for 10 min and rinsed twice with PBS and scraped into immunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide). The cell extract was centrifuged at 4 °C, 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and 1 mg of the supernatant was precleared by incubating with 16 μl of Protein G-Plus agarose and 0.25 μg of normal mouse IgG at 4 °C for 1 h. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and incubated with V5 antibody (1:1000) at 4 °C for 1 h, and 20 μl of Protein G-Plus-agarose was added and incubated overnight. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and washed once with ice-cold immunoprecipitation assay buffer and two times with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in 30 μl of 2× sample buffer prior to examination by Western analysis as below. To investigate PRLR ubiquitination using another approach, we employed the GST·UIM kit (Calbiochem). 5 × 106 PRL-deficient MCF-7 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with or without 4 nm PRL for 10 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS and harvested in cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, pH 2.0, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton-X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide). 1 mg of total protein was incubated with either the UBA domain of yeast Rad23 protein conjugated to glutathione (31Chen L. Shinde U. Ortolan T.G. Madura K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) or control glutathione alone, immobilized on agarose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 4 °C for 3 min at 1000 × g. Pellets were washed three times and resuspended in 2× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by Westerns.Western Analysis—Western analysis was performed as described previously (32Schroeder M.D. Rose-Hellekant T. Sandgren E.P. Schuler L.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In brief, 30 μg of protein of cellular lysate, immunoprecipitated proteins, or the acetone-precipitated conditioned media was electrophoresed through standard Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7-12% gels), transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and then probed with appropriate antibodies. Membranes were blocked for 4 h in 0.25% gelatin in TBST (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C (PRLR-ECD, 1:1000; V5, 1:500; ubiquitin, 1:1000; GHRcyt-AL47, 1:2000). Membranes were washed three times with TBST and then incubated with secondary antibody in 5% milk in TBST at room temperature for 1-2 h. Membranes were washed three times with TBST, and then signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence followed by autoradiography. For some experiments, signals were quantified by densitometry (ImageQuant software, v.4.2a, Amersham Biosciences).Indirect Immunofluorescence—PRL-deficient MCF-7 cells were grown as subconfluent monolayer cultures on glass coverslips overnight. To examine internalization of the lPRLR, cells were transfected with the HA-lPRLR expression plasmid. After the removal of the transfection reagent, cells were grown in serum-free RPMI 1640 overnight. Cells were treated with inhibitors for 20 min and then cooled on ice for 15 min, prior to incubation with antibody HA.11 (1:500) together with the same inhibitor in the blocking media (RPMI 1640 with 1% bovine serum albumin) on ice for 2 h. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS and incubated with prewarmed RPMI 1640 with or without 8 nm PRL for 0, 5, or 15 min. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and permeabilized with 1% Triton/PBS. Cells were incubated at 4 °C with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (1:400) overnight and then washed five times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 15 min, washed two times with PBS, and mounted using VECTASHIELD mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). A Zeiss Axiovert 200 motorized fluorescence microscope with deconvolution (Axiovision 3.1) and cooled CCD camera (Zeiss Axiocam HRm) was used to capture the images.Role of the Ubiquitin-conjugating System in Internalization—The Chinese hamster lung cell line (ts20) and ts20-GHR cells, which stably express the rabbit GHR, were gifts from Ger J. Strous (Utrecht, the Netherlands). lPRLR was transfected into ts20 cells to generate the stable cell line, ts20-lPRLR. Ts20 cells were grown in minimal essential medium α containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and 450 μg/ml G-418 at 30 °C in 5% CO2. For internalization studies, 3 × 105 cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown overnight at 30 °C. Cells were washed once with 1 ml of binding media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, pH 7.6) followed by incubation in prewarmed binding media containing I125 bovine placental lactogen (150,000 cpm, about 0.34 nm of 30 μCi/μg of labeled protein, near the Kd of these receptors), with or without a 300-fold excess (180 nm) of unlabeled PRL or bovine placental lactogen in 0.3 ml of binding media for 0, 30, 60, or 90 min at permissive (30 °C) or non-permissive (42 °C) temperature. Cells were then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding medium. Cell surface bound and the internalized ligand were harvested as described previously (7Lu J.-C. Scott P. Strous G.J. Schuler L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2515-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Specific binding in each fraction was determined as the difference between 125I ligand detected in the presence and in the absence of an excess of unlabeled hormone. The internalization ratio was expressed as a percentage of the specific internalized fraction with respect to total specific binding at 90 min as described (33Van Kerkhof P. Grovers R. Dos S. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1575-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Biotinylation—Cell surface proteins were biotinylated using a cell surface protein labeling kit (Pierce) with some adaptations. PRL-deficient MCF-7 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106 in 100-mm Petri dishes and serum-starved overnight. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and incubated at 4 °C in 200 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS biotin for 30 min. Following removal of unbound biotin with quenching solution and two washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were stimulated with 4 nm hPRL at 37 °C for 2 h. Lysates were harvested with the buffer provided in the kit supplemented with 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 1 mg of total protein was incubated with 100 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose (50%, v/v, in lysis buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Pellets were washed three times, resuspended in 2× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blot.RESULTSPRL Down-regulates the lPRLR in the PRL-deficient MCF-7 Cells— Receptor down-regulation permits peptide ligands to regulate availability of their receptors on the cell surface. However, some target cells, including breast cancer cells, express PRL endogenously, making it difficult to observe the effect of circulating ligand on the PRLR. Using a genetic selection method, we derived cell lines from MCF-7 cells that are deficient in endogenous PRL production (27Schroeder M.D. Symowicz J. Schuler L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which allowed us to examine the effect of exogenous PRL on the PRLR. lPRLR is the predominant isoform expressed in this cell line; other isoforms are not detected using an antibody to the shared ECD (data not shown), consistent with previous reports of the parent cell line (34Hu Z.-Z. Meng J. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41086-41094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, exogenous PRL rapidly down-regulated the lPRLR, which remained low through at least 24 h. This down-regulation was dependent on ligand concentration, as shown in Fig. 1C. However, lower concentrations of PRL were able to elicit substantial lPRLR down-regulation after longer incubations (Fig. 1, compare D with A).The lPRLR Undergoes Rapid Turnover—Levels of receptor expression are determined by the balance between synthesis and degradation. To determine the effect of ligand on turnover of the lPRLR, we used cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. In the absence of PRL, cycloheximide rapidly decreased cellular lPRLR levels with a half-life of about 100 min, indicating high turnover of the lPRLR even in the absence of ligand (Fig. 2). In the presence of PRL, the apparent half-life of the lPRLR fell to ∼25 min. This rate of degradation of endogenous lPRLR is comparable with surface receptors in rabbit mammary explants (35Djiane J. Delouis C. Kelly P.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 25: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the rabbit PRLR (6Genty N. Paly J. Edery M. Kelly P.A. Djiane J. Salesse R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 99: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that rapid turnover of the lPRLR is common across cell type and experimental system.FIGURE 2Role of protein synthesis in replenishment of the lPRLR. A, serum-starved PRL-deficient MCF-7 cells were treated with or without 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 0, 30, 60, 120, or 240 min ±4 nm hPRL.

To determine their respective roles in PRL-induced down-regulation of the lPRLR, we used pharmacological inhibitors. Cells were pretreated with proteasomal inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action (MG132 or lactacystin) or the lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine, for 1 h followed by the addition of PRL or vehicle for an additional 2 h. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, inhibition of both processes reduced PRL-induced down-regulation of the lPRLR. Over this time frame, these inhibitors had little effect on lPRLR levels in the absence of ligand.FIGURE 3Involvement of proteasomes and lysosomes in PRL-induced down-regulation of lPRLR. A, serum-starved PRL-deficient MCF-7 cells were pretreated with vehicle, 20 μm MG132 (M), 20 μm lactacystin (L), or 100 μm chloroquine (C) for 1 h at 37°C and then were treated ±4 nm PRL for an additional 2 h at 37°C.

Previous studies identified six functionally defined cis elements in the aggrecan promoter region which were shown to repress aggrecan gene expression (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Using competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) we have now identified in nuclear extracts a functional repressor cis element, (T/C)TCCCCT(A/C)RRC, which occurs at multiple locations within the chick aggrecan regulatory region. We purified the factor that binds to this cis element and established that it, APBP-1 (aggrecan promoter-binding protein-1), is a 19-kDa protein that has significant homology to CIRP (cold inducible RNA-binding protein). Recombinantly expressed APBP-1 mimics the native cis element-trans factor interaction in EMSAs. In situ hybridization demonstrates that aggrecan and APBP-1 RNA expression are restricted to complementary tissues in the developing limb, and Northern blot analysis of chick limb bud mRNA shows that APBP-1 mRNA expression is inversely correlated with aggrecan mRNA expression. Functional analyses by transient transfections and Northern blot analyses suggest APBP-1 has the capacity to repress aggrecan expression, indicating that this factor may be important regulator of aggrecan gene expression. Expression of the extracellular proteoglycan aggrecan is both cell-specific and developmentally regulated.

Differentiation of mesenchymal cells to chondrocytes and elaboration by those cells of an extracellular matrix composed of aggrecan, link protein, and collagen types II, IX, and XI results in the highly specialized connective tissue cartilage, which exhibits unique biochemical and biomechanical properties. Coordinate regulation of the genes underlying these properties may be essential for normal skeletal development and subsequent maintenance of the cartilage phenotype in postnatal life (2Schwartz N.B. Hennig A.K. Krueger R.C. Krzystolik M. Li H. Mangoura D. Fallon J.F. Goetinck P.F. Kelley R.O. Stocum D.L. Limb Development and Regeneration. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 505-514Google Scholar). Eukaryotic gene regulation entails interplay between activators and repressors of transcription whose interactions influence the tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of multitudes of genes. The aggrecan gene is dynamically regulated throughout embryonic life, with both mRNA and its protein product being up-regulated by 50-fold from day 2 to day 6, then undergoing a 2-fold decline by day 8 and reaching a steady plateau thereafter (2Schwartz N.B. Hennig A.K. Krueger R.C. Krzystolik M. Li H. Mangoura D. Fallon J.F. Goetinck P.F. Kelley R.O. Stocum D.L. Limb Development and Regeneration. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 505-514Google Scholar). Disruption of the delicate balance of transcription factors during development and/or later in life may lead to pathologic conditions. Although the etiologies of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis remain unknown, aggrecan degradation as well as reduced de novo matrix production is associated with each of these disease states. Therefore, to understand better how aggrecan gene expression is regulated, we have characterized the chick aggrecan gene promoter and enhancer region with the aim of identifying regulatory elements and their cognate transcription factors. We mapped a 400-bp region that actively mediates repression of aggrecan expression, removal of which increases aggrecan promoter activity by nearly 3-fold (3Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch J.R. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11566-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Three DNase I-protected footprint sequences that mediate repressor activity in the context of this 400-bp sequence have been identified and characterized (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The three protected sequences, named J (nucleotides -878 to -831), K (nucleotides -808 to -791), and L (nucleotides -730 to -703), contain various combinations of the sequences CACCTCC, TTCCCCT, and CTCCTCC. Mutation of each of these sites singly yielded nearly a 3-fold increase in promoter and enhancer activity, and each of these protected sequences produced a unique electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) 2The abbreviations used are: EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayAPBP-1aggrecan promoter-binding protein-1CIRPcold inducible RNA-binding proteinDIGdigoxigeninESTexpressed sequence tagGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. pattern that is cell type-specific (1Pirok III, E.W.

Competition EMSAs revealed that multiple tissue-specific DNA-protein complexes exist and that one complex in particular, designated band C, is detected with probes that contain these sequences. Although no transcription factor(s) acting at these sites has been described, the sequence elements CACCTCC, TTCCCCT, and CTCCTCC have also been shown to be important to varying degrees in the regulation of other matrix-specific genes (4Murray D.

Thus, our goal in this study was to characterize further one recently identified cis element that is functional in the chick aggrecan promoter and to use its sequence as a target to identify the interacting protein(s) present in chick cartilage. Consequently, a unique RNA/DNA-binding protein has been isolated, characterized, and shown to regulate aggrecan expression. Materials—Oligonucleotides were made with an Applied Biosystems 3808 DNA Synthesizer. Reagents for biochemical and molecular cloning experiments were of the highest quality available from commercial vendors. Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Cell Culture—Cultures of day 14 chick sternal chondrocytes were established as described previously (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 3Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch J.R. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11566-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, some cells grown for protein purification were incubated in 75-cm2 flasks rather than in dishes. Chondrocyte cultures were established in F-12 medium and fed on E14C0 and E14C4 with either F-12 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, as described under “Results.” Transient Transfection—Conditions of transfections conducted for luciferase and Northern blot experiments were as described by Pirok et al. (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 3Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch J.R. Henry J.

Triplicate plates containing ∼5 × 106 cells (day 12 chondrocytes)/100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) received between 10 and 20 pmol of a given plasmid construct to be assayed. One μg of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was cotransfected with each experimental construct to correct for cell loss. The transfections were allowed to proceed for 36 h. For in situ transfections, chondrocyte cultures established from E12 sternal cartilage were treated with 1 μg of purified recombinant APBP-1 using the Chariot™ Advantage delivery reagent as a vehicle (+APBP-1) or with 1 μg of albumin (-APBP-1). 18 h after treatment the cells were fixed, and in situ hybridization was performed using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled aggrecan probe. EMSA—100 pmol of each single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide was incubated in annealing buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 250 mm MgCl2) at 90 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool slowly for approximately 1 h. Standard methods were employed to end label and purify the double-stranded oligonucleotides. Briefly, 10 pmol of probe was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with kinase buffer (Promega), 20 units of T4 kinase, and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To stop the labeling reaction 0.5 m EDTA was added to the reaction, and the labeled probes were purified with a nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). For each reaction 20 fmol of the probe was incubated with varying amounts of nuclear protein (between 1 and 10 μg) for 30 min at 4 °C in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 1.5 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 375 mm KCl), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 3.75 μl of 20% Ficoll and water. For competition experiments excess double-stranded unlabeled probes were added to the binding reaction. The DNA-protein complexes were loaded into a 5% polyacrylamide gel as described. Gels were electrophoresed at 70 V for ∼3 h. HPLC—A Superdex-200 size exclusion gel was used at 4 °C for all HPLC experiments. 200 μg of crude nuclear protein was passed over the column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min in dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA). Fractions were separated by 12 or 15% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE, and the gels were either silver stained or subjected to Southwestern analysis. In-gel Southwestern Analysis—Gels were washed in renaturation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 m urea) for 3 h at room temperature with buffer changes every 15 min. Blocking buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% nonfat dry milk) was applied for 2 h and changed at least three times. 50 pmol of 32P-radiolabeled probe L and 50 μl of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml) were added to the blocking buffer, and the gel was allowed to incubate for an additional 3 h. The gel was then washed three times for 30 min each with blocking buffer, vacuum-dried, and subjected to autoradiography for 1 h. Affinity Purification—Roche Applied Science magnetic beads were employed as specified in the manufacturer's protocol for all affinity purifications. 60 dozen day 14 chick sternal chondrocytes were cultured for 1 week in 15 T250 flasks, yielding ∼50 ml of packed cells. Crude nuclear protein obtained as described previously (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was loaded into a Centricon (Amicon) column with a molecular mass cutoff of 50 kDa and centrifuged at 1,500 × g. The column was washed with four times the starting volume of dialysis buffer. The flow-through, which contained all nuclear proteins smaller than 50 kDa, was loaded into a Centricon column with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa and centrifuged at 1,500 × g. The concentrated (10-50 kDa) supernatant was purified further by affinity chromatography. One ng of double-stranded end-labeled probe L was ligated to a tethered 16-mer adaptor oligonucleotide covalently bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic particles. The magnetic beads and partially purified nuclear protein were incubated for 1 h on ice in a solution of 175 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer. A magnet was used to separate the DNA-bound nuclear factors from the nonspecific and unbound nuclear protein. The magnetic beads were washed three times with wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Tween 20 (w/v), 30 mm KCl), then DNA-binding proteins were eluted stepwise with increasing concentrations of KCl: 500 mm, 1 m, 2.5 m, 3.2 m, and 4 m. The wash and elution fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7, and lyophilized, then resuspended with 10 mm Tris, pH 8, the proteins separated by 15% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Typically 5-20 μg of protein was recovered/experiment. Mass Spectral Analysis and Microsequencing—Mass spectral analysis, trypsin digestion, ProFound and MS-FIT data base searches, and microsequencing of protein specimens were performed by the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center. ProFound is accessible at prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound; MS-Fit is available from the University of California San Francisco at prospector.ucsf.edu/. DNA Cloning and Protein Purification—The Invitrogen ProEXHTa system, which introduces His6 residues at the N terminus of the expressed protein, was used for bacterial expression of the cloned putative chick APBP-1 with the following primers: A1(NcoI), 5′-CATGCCATGGCATCGGATGAGGGC-3′; and A1.1(XbaI), 5′-GCATCTAGATTACTCGTTGTGTGTAGCGTAACTG-3′. For subcloning into the ProEXHTa vector, PCR-generated DNA fragments were digested with NcoI and XbaI, then ligated into the vector that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes. All clones were sequenced in their entirety before transformation into JM109 DE3 cells (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 3Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch J.R. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11566-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For mammalian expression experiments the pTargeT (Promega) vector was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the ProEXHTa vector ith the APBP-1 insert was used as a template for a PCR in which the primers Cirp1 5′-ATGGCATCGGATGAGGGCAAG-3′ and A1.1(XbaI) 5′-GCATCTAGATTACTCGTTGTGTGTAGCGTAACTG-3′ were used to generate a PCR fragment that was subcloned into the pTargeT vector. The clones were sequenced to ensure that no errors were generated during the amplification or cloning procedures. Expressed protein from bacteria was purified as described (8Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight bacterial cultures were centrifuged and the resultant pellet sonicated in buffer containing 5 mm imidazole and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9. After removal of bacterial debris by ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml affinity column of nitrilotriacetic acid resin charged with nickel (Qiagen), which binds to the imidazole moieties of the His tag residues to capture the expressed protein. Columns were washed with 15 volumes of IMAC 5 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 5 mm imidazole), then 10 volumes of IMAC 30, and the protein was eluted with 4 column volumes of IMAC 400. Protein samples were dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7, and lyophilized, then resuspended with 10 mm Tris, pH 8. RNA Preparation and Analysis—RNA was extracted from limb bud cultures established from day 2 chick embryos or from cultures established from embryonic day 14 chick sternal chondrocytes using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) or an RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen). Cultures were pelleted for 10 min in a JS-4.2 rotor at 3,000 rpm, resuspended in a volume of phosphate-buffered saline five times the packed cell volume, and then pelleted for another 5 min at 3,000 rpm. The RNA was then purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. For all Northern blot analyses, 1 mg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA along with 20 ng of PCR probe were added to the hybridization solution (QuikHyb, Stratagene). 20 ng of PCR-generated probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Rediprime II Random Prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were incubated at 68 °C for 1 h and then washed twice at room temperature for 15 min with 2 × SSC 0.1% SDS buffer. A high stringency wash was performed at 60 °C with 0.1 × SSC 0.1% SDS buffer. mRNA in Situ Hybridization—E12 chick limbs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight. The tissue was sunk in 20% sucrose and 10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline, embedded in 10% gelatin and 20% sucrose, and sectioned at a thickness of 40 μm. Sections were mounted on Superfrost/Plus microscope slides precoated with poly-l-lysine. Slides were processed for nonradioactive in situ hybridization by an adaptation of the method described by Grove et al. (9Grove E.A. Tole S. Limon J. Yip L. Ragsdale C.W. Development. 1998; 125: 2315-2325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the DIG-labeled RNA probe for in situ hybridization, a 690-bp (bp 3842-3152) cDNA fragment of the chick aggrecan gene was subcloned in the pSPT vector. Full-length cold inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) cDNA was produced by PCR and inserted into the pCRII dual promoter vector plasmid from Invitrogen. Sequencing of the cloned gene fragments was performed with an ABI PRISM 377XL sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the University of Chicago Cancer Center DNA sequencing facility. Riboprobes incorporating DIG-labeled nucleotides were synthesized from linearized plasmid templates with SP6 polymerase (Roche Applied Science). We previously reported the identification and characterization of three DNase I-protected footprint sequences, designated J, K, and L, which span the positions -878 to -831, -808 to -791, and -730 to -703, respectively, and which mediate repressor activity in the context of the chick aggrecan promoter and enhancer region (TABLE ONE) (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These three protected regions contain several similar and repetitive sequences, including repeats of the nucleotide sequences TCCCC and CTCCTCC. Comparison of EMSAs using crude nuclear protein from chick sternal chondrocytes, hybridized with probes J.1, J.2, and L, which correspond to DNase I-protected sequences J and L, revealed one complex, band C, which was produced by three different probes with similar sequences containing the subsequence TCCCC, and another complex, band B, that was produced by two of these three probes (TABLE ONE) (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Another sequence repeated within these probes was TCCTCC, a sequence that has been shown to bind to Sp1 or Sp3 (5Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The CTCCTCC sequence was deduced to be a component of complex A (TABLE ONE) (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).TABLE ONENucleotide sequences and summary of results utilizing double-stranded EMSA probes with crude nuclear protein purified from chick sternal chondrocytesNameaNames of the sequences used for EMSA probes were derived from the protected sequences determined via previous DNase I footprinting experiments of the aggrecan promoter and enhancer region.

Open table in a new tab Because crude nuclear protein bound EMSA probe L with greater affinity and specificity than some of the other probes containing similar sequences, this sequence was used to examine the nature of the functional cis element-trans factor interaction observed previously. We also examined whether Sp1 or Sp3 was participating in binding to any of these sequences or complexes using crude nuclear protein derived from day 14 chick sternal chondrocytes. The specific goals of the present studies were 6-fold: 1) to define which protected nucleotides of sequence L are necessary and sufficient to bind repressors of aggrecan expression in primary chondrocytes; 2) to determine whether Sp1 or Sp3 is involved in binding to the protected sequences K, J, or L; 3) to determine what other trans factor(s) is binding to this sequence; 4) to clone the transcription factor that binds to the core L sequence and to characterize its DNA binding properties; 5) to examine the expression patterns of the identified transcription factor in relation to aggrecan message levels in vivo and in an in vitro developmental model; and 6) to determine whether recombinant expression of the trans factor can functionally repress aggrecan expression. Core Sequence Necessary for Nuclear Protein Binding in the Protected Region L—To identify the nucleotides in region L necessary for the observed repressor activities, competition EMSAs with extracts derived from primary chondrocytes and probes bearing triple-substitution mutations of the native sequence (TABLE TWO) were used to define the minimal sequence necessary for the region L DNA-protein interactions (Fig. 1). Competition with 20 fmol of radiolabeled probe L showed that complexes B and C can be competed out with the mutated unlabeled oligonucleotides (400 fmol) L1, L3, L4, and L9 but not by L2, L5, L6, L7, or L8 (Fig. 1). The results for L5, L6, L7, and L8 suggest that motifs in the L subsequence CTCCCCTCAGCA are necessary for formation of complexes B and C. The inability of mutated L2 to compete for bands B and C suggests that mutation of the CTT triplet changed a half-site required for proper binding of the transcription factors to the primary site located in the CTCCCCTCAGCA sequence.TABLE TWOComplementary pairs of synthesized oligonucleotides used to form altered region L double-stranded EMSA probesNameOligonucleotide sequenceSizeL15′AAACTTCAGCACCTCCCCTCAGCACCAG-3′28-merL1.15′-CTGGTGCTGAGGGGAGGTGCTGAAGTTT-3′L25′-CCTAAACAGCACCTCCCCTCAGCACCAG-3′28-merL2.15′-CTGGTGCTGAGGGGAGGTGCTGTTTAGG-3′L35′-CCTCTTAAACACCTCCCCTCAGCACCAG-3′28-merL3.15′-CTGGTGCTGAGGGGAGGTGTTTAAGAGG-3′L45′-CCTCTTCAGAAACTCCCCTCAGCACCAG-3′28-merL4.15′-CTGGTGCTGAGGGGAGTTTCTGAAGAGG-3′L55′-CCTCTTCAGCACAAACCCTCAGCACCAG-3′28-merL5.15′-CTGGTGCTGAGGGTTTGTGCTGAAGAGG-3′L65′-CCTCTTCAGCACCTCAAATCAGCACCAG-3′28-merL6.15′-CTGGTGCTGATTTGAGGTGCTGAAGAGG-3′L75′-CCTCTTCAGCACCTCCCCAAAGCACCAG-3′28-merL7.15′-CTGGTGCTTTGGGGAGGTGCTGAAGAGG-3′L85′-CCTCTTCAGCACCTCCCCTCAAAACCAG-3′28-merL8.15′-CTGGTTTTGAGGGGAGGTGCTGAAGAGG-3′L95′-CCTCTTCAGCACCTCCCCTCAGCAAAAA-3′28-merL9.15′-TTTTTGCTGAGGGGAGGTGCTGAAGAGG-3′ Open table in a new tab Taken together with our earlier observation that probe J.1 (TABLE ONE) contains the sequence TTCCCCTAGAC and also forms complexes B and C (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), a deduced consensus sequence for complex B and C binding is (Y)TCCCCT(A/C)RRC, a novel cis element. Interestingly, another probe, J.2 (TABLE ONE), forms complex C but not B, and has a shortened version of this consensus sequence, TTCCCC (1Pirok III, E.W. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16894-16903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Perhaps some or all of the nucleotides T(A/C)RRC in the 3′-portion of the consensus sequence are required for the formation of complex B, or an upstream sequence containing CTT is necessary within 5-6 bases of the (Y)TCCCCT(A/C)RRC core for proper formation of complex B. Potential Sp1/Sp3 Binding to Chick Aggrecan Promoter—Because it was reported previously that Sp1 and Sp3 have the ability to bind to a TCCTCC consensus sequence present in the COL1A2 promoter (5Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24666-24672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we examined whether any interactions occur between anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antibodies and EMSA complexes formed with probes K and J.2, which both contain the TCCTCC sequence. Fig. 2 shows the results of incubating crude nuclear protein derived from chick sternal chondrocytes with probes J.1, J.2, K, and L (defined in TABLE ONE). Fig. 2A demonstrates that the addition of anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, or a combination of anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies had no effect on migration of complexes for"
