https://openalex.org/W1559795048,"A controversy in the field of bioenergetics has been whether mitochondria are capable of sequestering enough Ca2+ from cytosolic Ca2+ pulses to raise their intramitochondrial free Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]m). This is significant because an increase in [Ca2+]m has been linked to an increase in cellular metabolic rate through various mechanisms. To resolve this question, we exposed isolated liver mitochondria to physiological type pulses of Ca2+ produced using a pulse-generating system (Sparagna, G. C., Gunter, K. K., and Gunter, T. E.(1994) Anal. Biochem. 219, 96-103). We then measured the resulting mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. The uniporter was previously thought to be the only specific Ca2+ uptake mechanism in mitochondria. Our studies have uncovered an additional uptake mechanism, the rapid mode of uptake or RaM, which functions at the beginning of each pulse and allows mitochondria to sequester a considerable amount of Ca2+ from short pulses. We have shown that the RaM is reset by decreasing the [Ca2+] between pulses for a very short time, making this uptake mode ideally suited for Ca2+ sequestration from Ca2+ pulse sequences. With rapid Ca2+ uptake occurring at the beginning of each pulse, liver mitochondria may be able to sequester sufficient Ca2+ from a short sequence of pulses to activate the cellular metabolic rate.

https://openalex.org/W2013687281,"A consensus cyclic AMP response element (CRE) in the murine prostaglandin synthase-2 (PGS2) promoter is essential for pgs2 gene expression induced by pp60v-src, the v-src oncogene product. In this study, we investigate (i) the transcription factors active at the PGS2 “CRE site” in response to v-src activation and (ii) the signal transduction pathways by which pp60v-src activates these transcription factors. Transient transfection assays with pgs2 promoter/luciferase reporter chimeric genes suggest that c-Jun mediates v-src-induced pgs2 gene expression. Antibody supershift experiments demonstrate that c-Jun can participate in a complex with the pgs2 promoter CRE site. Moreover, in vitro immunocomplex assays demonstrate that pp60v-src expression strongly activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1) enzyme activity. Serines 63 and 73, the sites of c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK, are essential for v-src-induced, pgs2 promoter-mediated luciferase expression. Cotransfection studies with plasmids expressing wild-type JNK, dominant-negative JNK, and dominant-negative MEKK-1 confirm that activation of the Ras/MEKK-1/JNK/c-Jun pathway is required for v-src-induced pgs2 gene expression. Overexpression of either wild-type ERK-1 or ERK-2 proteins also potentiate v-src-mediated luciferase expression driven by the pgs2 promoter, and expression of dominant-negative mutants of ERK-1, ERK-2, or Raf-1 attenuate this response. Thus, in response to v-src expression, a Ras/MEKK-1/JNK signal transduction pathway activating c-Jun and a Ras/Raf-1/ERK pathway converge to mediate pgs2 gene expression via the CRE site in the pgs2 promoter.

The prostaglandins play key roles in a variety of biological processes, including cell division, blood pressure regulation, immune responses, ovulation, bone development, wound healing, and water balance. Altered prostaglandin production is associated with several pathophysiological states, including bone resorption, cardiovascular disease, acute inflammation, atherosclerosis, and colon cancer(1DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Google Scholar).

Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Google Scholar). Several laboratories have recently described the cloning of a second, inducible form of PGS. This gene, now referred to as pgs2 or cox2, was identified in differential library screens in fibroblasts transformed by the v-src oncogene(3Xie W. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Erikson R.L. Simmons D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2692-2696Google Scholar), in fibroblasts treated with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate(4Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Google Scholar), and in fibroblasts treated with platelet-derived growth factor(5Ryseck R.P. Raynoschek C. Macdonald-Bravo H. Dorfman K. Mattei M. Bravo R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 443-450Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that the pgs2 gene can be induced in a variety of cells, including macrophages, mast cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, neurons, smooth muscle cells, and ovarian granulosa cells. A variety of stimuli, including agents that act via G protein-mediated mechanisms, as well as the protein kinase C-mediated pathway activated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and the tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways activated by both growth factor receptors and pp60v-src, the product of the v-src oncogene, can stimulate the expression of the pgs2 gene (reviewed in (6Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Google Scholar)). However, the signal transduction mechanisms, the transcription factors, and the regulatory regions of the pgs2 gene necessary for PGS2 induction are not well understood. prostaglandin synthase activating transcription factor c-Jun N-terminal kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase cyclic AMP response element cyclic AMP response element binding protein electorphoretic mobility gel shift mitogen-activated protein. pp60v-src encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase(7Collett M.S. Purchio A.F. Erikson R.L. Nature. 1980; 285: 167-169Google Scholar). Several different approaches have been taken to try to elucidate how v-src transforms cells. These include identifying the substrates of the pp60v-src tyrosine kinase, isolating v-src inducible genes, and studying the transcriptional regulation of known genes whose mRNA levels are elevated in response to v-src expression. Because of (i) the wide range of cells that express PGS2 and the diverse stimuli that modulate pgs2 gene expression, (ii) the great interest in therapeutic modulation of prostaglandin synthesis, and (iii) the great interest in the mechanisms of v-src-mediated gene expression and transformation, we have been investigating the cis-acting DNA elements, the transcription factors, and the signal transduction pathways that mediate v-src activation of the pgs2 gene. By using promoter deletions and site-directed mutagenesis in pgs2-luciferase chimeric reporter genes, we show that a CRE site located between nucleotides -56 and -52 of the pgs2 gene is essential for v-src induction(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). A dominant-negative cyclic AMP binding protein (CREB) mutant, M1, blocked v-src-mediated expression, supporting the conclusion that this CRE site is necessary for pgs2 expression induced by pp60v-src(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). Finally, cotransfection of a dominant-negative Ras mutant blocked v-src-mediated induction of the pgs2-luciferase chimeric gene, suggesting that the pp60v-src-initiated pathway of PGS2 activation is mediated by Ras(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). In this report, we identify c-Jun as a transcription factor active at the PGS2 CRE site following v-src expression and determine the signal transduction pathway that mediates the activation of this factor. We previously referred to PGS2 as TIS10 (4Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Google Scholar, 9Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Google Scholar). Our promoter constructs thus historically have the TIS10 designation(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar, 9Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Google Scholar). The reporter constructs pTIS10-80LUC and pTIS10-40LUC, as well as the v-src expression vector pMV-src were described previously(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). The overlapping CRE and E-box sites of the PGS2 regulatory region are located at nucleotides -56 to -48. Thus, the pTIS10-80LUC contains the overlapping CRE and E-box cis-acting sites of the pgs2 promoter, while the pTIS10-40LUC construct has these sites deleted. The plasmid pGal4TIS10-40LUC was constructed by ligating five GAL4 DNA binding sites to the 5′-end of the pTIS10-40LUC reporter. Expression vectors of pRSV-CREB, GAL4-CREB (a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to CREB), and GAL4-M1 (a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to the dominant-negative M1 CREB mutant) (10Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Google Scholar) were the gifts of Dr. Marc Montminy (Salk Institute). The expression vectors pSRαMSVtkNeo-c-Jun and pSRαMSVtkNeo-c-Fos (11Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Google Scholar) were the gifts of Dr. Charles Sawyers (UCLA). The expression vectors for GAL4DB, GAL4-c-Jun, and GAL4-c-JUN 63/73 (a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to a c-Jun protein in which serines 63 and 73 are substituted by leucines; (12Franklin C.C. Sanchez V. Wagner F. Woodgett J.R. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7247-7251Google Scholar)) were gifts from Dr. Andrew Kraft (University of Alabama, Birmingham). Plasmid pRSV-ATF3, an expression vector that encodes ATF-3(13Low K.G. Chu H.M. Schwartz P.M. Daniels G.M. Melner M.H. Comb M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4958-4974Google Scholar), was the gift of Dr. Kenneth Low (New England Biolabs). Expression vectors for ATF-2 and GAL4-ATF2 (14Kim S.-J. Wagner S. Liu F. O'Reilly M.A. Robbins P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 331-334Google Scholar) were the gifts of Dr. Michael Green (University of Massachusetts). pSRαMEKΔ(K432M), an expression vector that encodes a dominant-negative MEKK-1, was from Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego)(15Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar). pEVX-3RatK375A, an expression vector that encodes a dominant-negative Raf-1(16Macdonald S.G. Crews C.M. Wu L. Driller J. Clark R. Erikson R.L. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6615-6620Google Scholar), was from Dr. Susan Macdonald (ONYX, CA). pCDNA-Flag-JNK1 and pCDNA-DN-JNK1, expression vectors for Flag-tagged JNK1 and kinase-defective JNK1, respectively, and GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1-79) (15Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar) were the gifts of Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts). The expression vectors pCEP4Erk1, pCEP4Erk2, pCEP4Erk1 K71R, and pCEP4Erk2 K52R, encoding wild-type ERK1, wild-type ERK2, dominant-negative ERK1, and dominant-negative ERK2, respectively, were the gifts of Dr. Melanie Cobb (University of Texas, Southwestern). NIH 3T3 cells were grown and transfected as described previously(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). 3 μg of various reporter constructs and 1.5 μg of the v-src expression vector pMV-src or the empty expression vector pEVX per 60-mm dish were used for all experiments. The amounts of other constructs are specified in each experiment. The luciferase assay was performed as described previously(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). Triplicate dishes were used for all transfections, and all experiments were repeated at least twice. The JNK immunocomplex kinase assay was performed as described(15Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar). 6 μg of plasmid encoding Flag-tagged JNK1 was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells in 100-mm dishes, using the calcium phosphate method(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar), along with either 4 μg of v-src expression vector pMV-src or empty vector pEVX. The cells were kept in 0.5% newborn calf serum for 24 h after transfection, then lysed in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM sodium glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were pre-absorbed with Sepharose-4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 30 min before the M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) against Flag was added. A small sample of cell extract from each cell lysate was taken for protein assay to standardize for gel loading after the kinase reaction. M2 antibody was mixed with Sepharose beads for 1.5 h in a cold room, and extra antibody was washed away using lysis buffer. Then, the antibody-conjugated beads were added to the preabsorbed cell lysate for another 1.5 h. The binding mixtures were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer(15Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar). The kinase assay was carried out in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MgCl2, 25 mM sodium glycerophosphate, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μM ATP, 2 μg of GST-c-Jun, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30°C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS loading buffer and incubating in boiling water for 5 min. The reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, which were then dried and exposed to x-ray film. Nuclear extracts were prepared from UP1A1 cells, a 3T3 cell line carrying a temperature sensitive v-src gene (8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). The nuclear extract used for gel shift in this report was prepared from cells grown at the permissive temperature, where v-src is active. The gel shift and supershift protocols were as described previously(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar), with the exception that the running buffer used in this study is composed of 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, instead of Tris-glycine buffer. The c-Jun and CREB binding protein antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech. Deletion and mutation analysis of the pgs2 promoter identified the CRE site CGTCA located at nucleotide -56 of the murine pgs2 gene as essential for v-src-induced pgs2 expression(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). EMGS supershift experiments with anti-CREB antibody demonstrated that CREB binds to this PGS2 CRE site(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). CREB-M1, a dominant-negative CREB mutant that binds to CRE sequences but has an inactive transactivation domain(10Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Google Scholar), blocks v-src-mediated PGS2 activation(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). We proposed that CREB and/or another member of the ATF transcription factor family might mediate v-src induction from the CRE site of the pgs2 promoter(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). We first tested whether increasing the levels of wild-type CREB in cells could enhance v-src-mediated induction from the pgs2 promoter of the pTIS10-80LUC chimeric reporter gene. This construct contains nucleotides -80 to +3 of the pgs2 promoter (we previously referred to PGS2 as TIS10(4Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Google Scholar, 9Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Google Scholar); our promoter constructs thus historically have the TIS10 designation(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar, 9Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Google Scholar)). However, overexpression of CREB, like overexpression of the dominant-negative CREB-M1 mutant, inhibits v-src-induced luciferase expression from the PGS2 reporter (Fig. 1). Because we were concerned that high levels of CREB might “squelch” (17Cahill M.A. Ernst W.H. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 105-108Google Scholar) CREB-dependent expression from the pgs2 promoter, we also used lower concentrations of wild-type CREB expression vector (data not shown). Enhancement of luciferase expression from the pgs2 promoter by CREB was never observed. We conclude that some transcription factor other than CREB is activated by pp60v-src expression and elevates pgs2 gene expression by transcriptional activation from the PGS2 CRE site. We next tested whether overexpression of other ATF transcription factors might modulate v-src induction from the pgs2 promoter. Overexpression of both ATF-2 and ATF-3, like CREB or CREB-M1 overexpression, also inhibited, rather than augmented, v-src-induced expression from the PGS2 CRE site (data not shown). We conclude that the ATF family members CREB, ATF-2, and ATF-3 do not mediate v-src induction of the pgs2 gene. The data presented in this section demonstrating that occupation of the PGS2 CRE site by CREB, DN-CREB, ATF-2, and ATF-3 block v-src-mediated pgs2 gene expression suggest (i) that this site is necessary for v-src-mediated induction of the pgs2 gene and (ii) that some transcription factor(s) other than these molecules must mediate this induction. EMGS and antibody-supershift experiments previously demonstrated that other, unidentified nuclear protein(s) in addition to CREB can bind to the PGS2 CRE site(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). c-Jun, a member of the bZIP transcription factor superfamily, can form heterodimers with members of the ATF family and bind to CRE sequences(18Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Jun•c-Fos heterodimers can also bind to CRE sequences(19Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Google Scholar). We next investigated whether c-Jun might play a role in the v-src-mediated induction of the pgs2 gene. We used antibody to c-Jun in a supershift experiment to determine if c-Jun is present in a complex that binds to the PGS2 CRE site. An E-box overlaps the CRE site of the pgs2 gene and acts as an alternative site for binding of nuclear proteins(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). By adding E-box oligonucleotide competitor, we were able to reduce binding of proteins in nuclear extracts to the E-box sequence of the pgs2 promoter and enhance the binding of CREB and the additional nuclear factor(s) that binds to the PGS2 CRE site(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). The gel shift experiment shown in Fig. 2 was performed in the presence of E-box competitor to reduce (but not eliminate) the E-box complexes. The faster moving CRE site complex was previously identified, by supershift with anti-CREB antibody, as a CREB-containing complex(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). c-Jun antibody can recognize and supershift one of the slower moving complexes of the PGS2 CRE site (Fig. 2). In contrast, antibody to another protein (CREB binding protein) does not cause a supershift. c-Jun antibody alone does not form any complex with the CRE probe. The data demonstrate that the c-Jun protein is able to participate in a binding complex at the PGS2 CRE site. Although the ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases can phosphorylate c-Jun in vitro(20Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Google Scholar), it is now clear that the recently cloned (21Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar) JNKs are the kinases that generally phosphorylate and activate c-Jun in vivo(21Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar, 22Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Dérijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Google Scholar, 23Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Google Scholar). JNK1 and JNK2 are strongly activated by tumor necrosis factor α(24Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar), environmental stress(24Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar), and UV light(22Minden A. Lin A. Smeal T. Dérijard B. Cobb M. Davis R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Google Scholar). If c-Jun activation plays a role in v-src-mediated PGS2 induction, we would expect that v-src expression would activate JNK. Flag epitope-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated, with an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody, from NIH 3T3 cells cotransfected either with a vector encoding Flag epitope-tagged JNK1 and either the v-src expression vector pMV-src or the empty vector pEVX. Immunocomplex kinase assays were then performed, using a GST-c-Jun recombinant protein as substrate(15Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar). Expression of v-src activates JNK1 kinase activity (Fig. 3). If v-src-mediated induction of PGS2 requires JNK activation and phosphorylation of c-Jun, we would expect that modulation of JNK levels in cells would alter the response of the pgs2 promoter to v-src expression. This is the case; overexpression of wild-type JNK1 potentiates v-src-mediated luciferase expression from the pTIS10-80LUC luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4, left panel, lane 3), while co-expression of a kinase-defective, dominant-negative JNK1 attenuates v-src-mediated expression of luciferase from this reporter (Fig. 4, left panel, lanes 4 and 5). These data suggest that JNK activation plays an obligate role in v-src-mediated induction of gene expression from the pgs2 promoter. We previously demonstrated that v-src-induced pgs2 gene expression required mediation by Ras(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). Ras activates several signal transduction pathways, each pathway leading to phosphorylation of distinct subsets of transcription factors(25Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar). The downstream effector of Ras leading to activation of JNK enzyme activity and phosphorylation of c-Jun is the MAP kinase kinase kinase MEKK-1 (15Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar). In contrast, Ras activation of the Raf-1 MAP kinase kinase kinase leads to phosphorylation of transcription factors such as TCF/Elk-1 and c-Myc(25Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar). Expression of kinase-defective, dominant-negative MEKK-1 blocks v-src-mediated expression of luciferase from the pTIS10-80LUC luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 4, right panel). We conclude that activated transcription from the pgs2 gene following expression of pp60v-src requires Ras activation of MEKK-1 and JNK, leading to phosphorylation of c-Jun, and subsequent increased transcription mediated by the CRE site of the pgs2 promoter. We wished to more fully explore the nature of the regulated activation domain(s) required to drive luciferase expression by the transcription factor complex assembled at the pgs2 gene in response to pp60v-src. We replaced the CRE sequence in the pgs2 luciferase reporter with yeast transcription factor GAL4 DNA binding sites (Fig. 5, top) and investigated what transactivation domains in chimeric GAL4 DNA binding proteins can mediate v-src activation of the minimal pgs2 promoter. No endogenous transcription factor in 3T3 cells will bind to the GAL4 sites. A luciferase reporter gene containing only the first 40 nucleotides of the pgs2 promoter, TIS10-40LUC, expresses only minimal luciferase activity. This plasmid does not contain the overlapping CRE and E-box sites of the pgs2 promoter and is not responsive to v-src expression(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). If five GAL4 binding sites are added to this promoter, this gal4-pgs2 luciferase construct similarly expresses only minimal luciferase activity (Fig. 5, middle panel, lane 1) and does not respond to v-src expression (Fig. 5, middle panel, lane 3). Expression of the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone (GAL4-DB) does not enhance luciferase expression from the gal4-pgs2 luciferase chimeric reporter vector (Fig. 5, middle panel, lane 2; lower panel, lane 1) or mediate v-src induction from this reporter (Fig. 5, middle panel, lane 4). Expression of a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the c-Jun activation domain (amino acids 5-200; GAL4-JUN) can activate basal expression from the Gal4-TIS10-40 luciferase chimeric reporter vector (Fig. 5, middle panel, lane 5; lower panel, lane 2). However, when pp60v-src is also expressed, along with the GAL4-JUN protein, expression from the GAL4-TIS10-40 reporter vector is substantially enhanced (Fig. 5, middle panel, lane 6; lower panel, lane 3). We conclude that the c-Jun activation domain, if positioned upstream of the minimal pgs2 promoter, can drive v-src-induced gene expression. In contrast, if the activation domains of ATF-2 or CREB are positioned adjacent to the minimal pgs2 promoter by the GAL4 DNA binding domain of GAL4-DB chimeric proteins, these activation domains are unable to mediate either basal or v-src-induced luciferase expression from the pgs2 promoter (Fig. 5, lower panel, lanes 5 and 6). Phosphorylation of two serine residues, Ser-63 and Ser-73, is required for c-Jun activation and transcription from AP-1 sites(26Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Google Scholar, 27Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Grover-Bardwick A. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3507-3513Google Scholar). To determine if phosphorylation of these two sites is essential for v-src-induced expression from the pgs2 reporter, we used an expression vector in which the serines at these two sites have been mutated to leucines. GAL4-JUN 63/73, in which these sites of phosphorylation have been altered, is unable to mediate v-src activation of the gal4-pgs2 luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 5, lower panel, lane 4). An intact c-Jun activation domain, with sites of phosphorylation available, is necessary for v-src-mediated transcriptional activation of the pgs2 promoter. Like JNK, the MAP kinase enzymes ERK-1 and ERK-2 can also be activated by pp60v-src expression(28Gardner A.M. Vaillancourt R.R. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17896-17901Google Scholar, 29Troppmair J. Bruder J.T. Munoz H. Lloyd P.A. Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Avruch J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7030-7035Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether these kinases might also mediate PGS2 induction by v-src. Co-expression of ERK-1 or ERK-2 potentiates v-src-mediated luciferase expression from the pTIS10-80LUC luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 6, left panel). Moreover, co-expression of kinase-deficient, dominant-negative forms of ERK-1 or ERK-2 substantially attenuate v-src-mediated luciferase expression from this reporter. Raf-1 is the MAP kinase kinase kinase that mediates activation of the ERK enzymes by Ras(25Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar). If the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway plays a role in v-src induction of gene expression from the pgs2 promoter, one would expect that a dominant-negative Raf-1 mutation should also block this induction. This is the case; increased inhibition of v-src-mediated luciferase induction from the pgs2 promoter is observed as increasing amounts of a dominant-negative Raf-1 protein are expressed (Fig. 6, right panel). If c-Jun mediates v-src-induced pgs2 gene expression, one might expect that overexpression of c-Jun would augment luciferase expression from the pTIS10-80LUC reporter in response to v-src in a cotransfection assay. This is not the case in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 7). However, in contrast to overexpression of ATF proteins, which block v-src induction from the pgs2 promoter (Fig. 7), c-Jun overexpression does not interfere with v-src induction of pgs2 gene expression. Our data suggest that, while c-Jun participates in v-src-mediated induction of pgs2 gene expression, the amount of c-Jun in NIH 3T3 cells is not limiting in this induction. c-Jun can form heterodimers with members of the ATF family (18Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Google Scholar) and bind to CRE sequences. Moreover, c-Jun•c-Fos heterodimers can also bind to CRE sequences(19Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Google Scholar). We therefore examined the ability of these two transcription factors, alone and in combination, to modulate v-src induction from the pgs2 promoter. Like overexpression of c-Jun alone, overexpression of c-Fos alone neither enhances or attenuates v-src-induced luciferase expression from pTIS10-80LUC. However, co-expression of both c-Jun and c-Fos together potentiates v-src-induced luciferase expression from the pgs2 reporter. In contrast, as discussed above, the ATF proteins CREB and ATF-3 block v-src-mediated induction from the pgs2 promoter (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:). These data suggest that both components of the AP-1 transcription complex may participate in the v-src activated transcription of the pgs2 promoter from the CRE site. Elevated prostaglandin production is a characteristic of Rous sarcoma virus-transformed fibroblasts(30Barker K. Aderem A. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2929-2935Google Scholar). Persistent elevation of pgs2 gene expression in v-src-transformed cells is responsible for this increased prostaglandin production(3Xie W. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Erikson R.L. Simmons D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2692-2696Google Scholar, 31Han J.W. Sadowski H. Young D.A. Macara I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3373-3377Google Scholar). A CRE at nucleotides -56 to -52 of the pgs2 promoter is the critical element in v-src-mediated activation of the pgs2 gene(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). pp60v-src has been reported to modulate immediate-early gene expression through the serum response element of the egr1/tis8 gene(32Qureshi S.A. Cao X. Sukhatme V.P. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10802-10806Google Scholar), at a dyad symmetry element and a Sis-inducible factor responsive element in the c-fos gene(33Fujii M. Shalloway D. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2493-2499Google Scholar), through the CCAAT and TATAA elements of the junB gene(34Apel I. Yu C.-L. Wang T. Dobry C. Van Antwerp M.E. Jove R. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3356-3364Google Scholar), and via a v-src-responsive element of the 9E3/CEF-4 gene(35Dehbi M. Mbiguino A. Beauchemin M. Chatelain G. Bedard P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1490-1499Google Scholar). However, v-src modulation of gene expression via a CRE has only been observed for the pgs2 gene(8Xie W. Fletcher B.S. Andersen R.D. Herschman H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6531-6539Google Scholar). We anticipated that the CRE-dependent v-src transactivation of the pgs2 gene might involve c-Jun activation, since oncogenic forms of both Ras and Src can activate transcription via c-Jun phosphorylation(26Binetruy B. Smeal T. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 351: 122-127Google Scholar, 27Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Grover-Bardwick A. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3507-3513Google Scholar). Our demonstration that v-src-induced activation of JNK activity correlates with PGS2 induction is consistent with this hypothesis. The ability of dominant-negative inhibitory forms of Ras, MEKK, and JNK, the mediators of the c-Jun phosphorylation/activation pathway, to block v-src-induced expression from the pgs2 promoter also supports this proposal. The antibody supershift demonstration that c-Jun is a part of a protein complex that can recognize the PGS2 CRE also supports this hypothesis. Based on these data, we conclude that v-src activates the Ras/MEKK1/JNKK(SEK1)/JNK(SAPK) signal transduction pathway to phosphorylate c-Jun and stimulate transcription from the CRE of the pgs2 gene. v-src-mediated activation of c-Jun and pgs2 gene transcription is diagramed in Fig. 8. The c-Jun transactivation domain, when fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain, can drive expression from a pgs2 promoter in which the CRE is replaced by GAL4 DNA binding sites. In contrast, ATF transactivation domains placed at this site are unable to mediate pgs2 gene expression. Moreover, this response is eliminated when the sites of JNK phosphorylation are mutationally altered in the c-Jun transactivation domain of the GAL4-JUN chimeric transactivator, clearly demonstrating that phosphorylation of the c-Jun transactivation domain by JNK plays a critical role in v-src-induced transcription from the pgs2 gene. c-Jun is also phosphorylated following exposure of cells to inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α (24Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar) and interleukin 1(21Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1 are also potent activators of prostaglandin production and induce the expression of the pgs2 gene in rat mesangial cells(38Feng L. Xia Y. Garcia G.E. Hwang D. Wilson C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1669-1675Google Scholar). Thus, c-Jun activation and the CRE of the pgs2 promoter may also play a role in mediating PGS2 induction by these inflammatory cytokines. UV irradiation is among the strongest JNK activators(21Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar). It will be of great interest to determine whether UV radiation can induce pgs2 gene expression. We thought c-Jun•ATF-2 heterodimer would be a likely candidate for the v-src-activated transcription factor active at the PGS2 CRE, since c-Jun•ATF-2 heterodimer mediates both virus activation at the human interferon 1β gene CRE (39Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Google Scholar) and E1A activation of c-Jun transcription at the c-Jun CRE(40van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. de Vries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. van der Eb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Google Scholar). Moreover, ATF-2 is also a JNK substrate(41Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar). However, wild-type ATF-2 protein inhibits PGS2 induction by v-src, suggesting that ATF-2, either as a heterodimer with c-Jun or as a homodimer, does not play a role in v-src-mediated induction of pgs2 expression. We obtained similar results with ATF-3 transfection, demonstrating that this member of the ATF family of transcription factors also does not play a role in v-src-mediated induction of pgs2 expression. The inability of GAL4-ATF2 fusion protein to mediate v-src induction from the gal4-pgs2 chimeric promoter further substantiates the conclusion that v-src-activated transcription at the pgs2 promoter does not involve ATF-2. It is possible that another member(s) of the ATF family may act as a heterodimer with c-Jun to mediate v-src-mediated induction of the pgs2 gene. Protein X in Fig. 8 might thus be an as yet untested member of the ATF transcription factor family, forming a heterodimer with activated c-Jun. This possibility could be explored by similar transfection experiments with other members of the ATF family. Antisense experiments to inhibit the expression of members of the ATF family could also be used to further explore this question, as described by Du et al.(39Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Google Scholar). c-Fos•c-Jun (AP-1) heterodimers are able to bind CRE sequences(19Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Google Scholar, 42Rauscher III, F.J. Voulalas P.J. Franza Jr., B.R. Curran T. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1687-1699Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Fos•c-Jun heterodimers can modulate transcription from a CRE(43Pedraza-Alva G. Zingg J.-M. Jost J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6978-6985Google Scholar). c-Fos overexpression can cooperate with c-Jun overexpression to cause increased transactivation at the pgs2 promoter CRE in response to pp60v-src (Fig. 7), suggesting that c-Jun•c-Fos heterodimer may play a role in pgs2 gene activation. We have no evidence that v-src can cause activation of pre-existing c-Fos protein, as required for immediate-early gene expression(44Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Google Scholar). However, ligand and oncogene activation of a c-Fos kinase(s) distinct from either JNK or ERK kinases has been described(37Nel A.E. Taylor L.K. Kumar G.P. Gupta S. Wang S.C. Williams K. Liao O. Swanson K. Landreth G.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4347-4357Google Scholar, 45Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Fos phosphorylation by this kinase activates c-Fos transcriptional activity(45Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that c-Jun/c-Fos transcriptional activity at the PGS2 CRE may be directly activated by parallel protein kinase pathways activated by v-src. If this is the case, protein X in Fig. 8 would be a c-Fos protein, phosphorylated by one of the recently described c-Fos kinases. It will be necessary to examine the consequences of modulating Fos kinase activity on v-src-mediated induction of pgs2 gene expression, once this kinase(s) has been cloned, to determine if direct activation of c-Fos plays a role in this v-src-induced response. We suggest that v-src may be a powerful activator of immediate-early gene transcription because it can activate a variety of kinase-mediated signal transduction cascades, leading to phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of a number of pre-existing transcription factors. v-src-activated expression from the PGS2 CRE can be enhanced by expression of ERK proteins and partially blocked by expression of dominant interfering ERK or Raf-1 proteins. These results demonstrate that the Raf/MEK/ERK(MAPK) pathway also plays a role in v-src activation of pgs2 gene expression at the PGS2 CRE. ERKs do not transcriptionally activate either c-Jun or c-Fos by direct phosphorylation(23Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Google Scholar, 25Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar). They do, however, increase AP-1 activity in cells by phosphorylating and activating the transcription factor TCF/Elk-1 responsible for increased expression from the c-Fos gene(23Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Google Scholar, 25Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar). One might expect that the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway might play a major role in secondary response genes whose induction is mediated by AP-1, following the immediate-early gene mechanism that increases c-Fos and c-Jun proteins in cells. In this case, protein X expressed in response to MAPK activation of ELK/SRF in Fig. 8 would be the c-Fos protein. In this regard, it is of considerable interest to note that PGS2 expression following v-src activation is persistent; pgs2 expression remains constantly elevated in v-src-transformed cells(3Xie W. Chipman J.G. Robertson D.L. Erikson R.L. Simmons D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2692-2696Google Scholar, 30Barker K. Aderem A. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2929-2935Google Scholar). In contrast, PGS2 induction by growth factors, tumor promoters, or inflammatory cytokines is transient and returns to basal values even if ligand is present continuously(6Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Google Scholar). These data suggest that v-src may induce AP-1 expression by a Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, activating an additional, transcription-dependent mechanism of increased pgs2 gene expression that is not shared with other inducers.

The elements in the human PDGF-A promoter that mediate increased expression of the gene in vascular endothelial cells have not been identified. A potent inducer of PDGF-A expression in endothelial cells is phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). 5′-Deletion and transfection analysis revealed that a G+C-rich region in the proximal PDGF-A promoter is required for PMA-inducible gene expression.

A specific nucleoprotein complex is formed when an oligonucleotide bearing the G+C-rich element is incubated with nuclear extracts from PMA-treated cells. The temporal appearance of this complex is consistent with the transient increase in Egr-1 transcripts. Antibodies to Egr-1 completely supershift the PMA-induced complex. Interestingly, increased nuclear levels of Egr-1 attenuate the ability of Sp1 to interact with the oligonucleotide, implicating competition between Egr-1 and Sp1 for the G+C-rich element.

PDGF occurs as a homodimer or heterodimer of A- and B-chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds and has a relative molecular mass of approximately 28 kDa. The biological response to PDGF is mediated by high affinity cell-surface receptors with split tyrosine kinase domains. The α-receptor is bound by both polypeptide chains of PDGF, whereas the β-subunit is bound with high affinity only by the B-chain (Heldin et al., 1988). PDGF A-chain mRNA has been detected in a variety of cells of human origin in culture (Betsholtz et al., 1986; Raines et al., 1990) and undergoes alternative splicing of exons 2 (Sanchez et al., 1991) and 6 (Collins et al., 1987; Tong et al., 1987). Three transcript species can be generated from the human PDGF-A gene (Bonthron et al., 1988), which are derived from the same transcriptional start site (Takimoto et al., 1991) and arise from the utilization of alternative poly(A) sites in exon 7 (Bonthron et al., 1988). Somatic cell hybrid chromosome segregation analysis (Betsholtz et al., 1986) and in situ hybridization using endothelial cell-derived cDNA (Bonthron et al., 1988) or non-isotopic techniques and genomic clones (Bonthron et al., 1992) assigned the gene to chromosome 7 (7p21-p22). platelet-derived growth factor early growth response gene product Wilms' tumor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase bovine aortic endothelial cells electrophoretic mobility shift assay base pair(s) dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Isolation of genomic clones encoding the human PDGF A-chain gene allowed characterization of its structural organization and facilitated subsequent investigation of the molecular mechanisms controlling transcription of the gene (Bonthron et al., 1988; Rorsman et al., 1988; Takimoto et al., 1991). The human PDGF A-chain gene spans approximately 24 kilobases of genomic DNA and has a single transcriptional start site located 36 bp downstream of the TATA box (Bonthron et al., 1988). The minimal promoter region, sufficient for optimal promoter activity, consists of approximately 150 bp in human epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) cells (Lin et al., 1992) and 120 bp in African green monkey renal epithelial (BSC-1) cells (Kaetzel et al., 1994). This region, rich in G+C content, is hypersensitive to cleavage by S1 nuclease (Wang et al., 1992a) and contains potential overlapping recognition elements for the zinc-finger transcription factor, Sp1 (Dynan and Tjian, 1983; Kadonaga et al., 1987), the immediate-early growth response gene product, Egr-1 (Krox-24, zif268) (Rauscher et al., 1990), and the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene product, WT-1 (Rauscher et al., 1990). Although this G+C-rich sequence in the PDGF-A promoter is bound by nuclear proteins from cultured BSC-1 cells (Kaetzel et al., 1994), and Egr-1 and WT-1 overexpression can modulate promoter activity (Gashler et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1992b), it is unclear whether Sp1, Egr-1, or WT-1 actually play a physiologic role in the transcriptional regulation of PDGF-A. Several upstream promoter regions have also been implicated in the induced expression of the gene. First, a novel element located between bp -102 and -82 interacts with nuclear protein(s) (PDGF-A-BP-1) in human mesangial cells exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Bhandari et al., 1995). Second, a consensus serum response element between bp -477 and -468 mediates PDGF-induced reporter gene expression in human foreskin fibroblasts (Lin et al., 1992). The PDGF-A promoter is also subject to negative transcriptional regulation. Overexpression of WT-1 represses PDGF-A promoter-dependent reporter gene expression in murine fibroblasts and human embryonic kidney cells (Gashler et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1992b). Additionally, 5′-deletion analysis in BSC-1 cells defined two negative regulatory regions located between bp -1800 and -1029 and bp -1029 and -880 (Kaetzel et al., 1994). The identity of the endogenous nuclear transcription factors that actually interact with any of the regulatory regions in the PDGF-A promoter has not been determined. In this report, PMA was used as a model agonist to define specific nuclear transcription factors that interact with functional nucleotide elements in the proximal PDGF-A promoter in cultured vascular endothelial cells. Using 5′-deletion and transient transfection analysis, we demonstrate the requirement for the region between bp -71 and -55 for PMA-inducible expression. This region bears overlapping Egr-1 and Sp1 binding elements. Northern blot analysis reveals that PMA induces Egr-1 expression with a time course earlier than PDGF-A, whereas Sp1 transcript levels are unchanged. Gel shift and supershift studies demonstrate that both PMA-induced and recombinant Egr-1 bind to the G+C-rich element by displacing Sp1. Mutations that abolish the ability of Egr-1 to interact with the proximal PDGF-A promoter also abrogate expression induced either by PMA or overexpressed Egr-1. Thus, PMA-induced expression of the PDGF A-chain in endothelial cells is mediated, at least in part, by the rapid and transient induction of Egr-1 and involves an interchange of factors occupying the G+C-rich element in the proximal promoter. This displacement mechanism may be a common theme in the induced expression of the PDGF A-chain gene by multiple signals in a variety of biological settings. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a 392 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) and purified by gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and purified using Chromaspin-10 columns (Clontech). A nested series of 5′-deletion fragments of the human PDGF A-chain promoter that were fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) cDNA (Gashler et al., 1992; Kaetzel et al., 1994) was used in transient transfection assays in BAEC. Constructs A.SV40-CAT and Am.SV40-CAT were built by blunt-end subcloning the appropriate double-stranded oligonucleotide into the BglII site of pCAT promoter (Promega). Introduced sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing using the dideoxynucleotide termination method with modified T7 polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [α-35S]dATP (DuPont NEN). BAEC were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.4, containing 10% calf serum. Cells were passaged every 3-4 days in 75-cm2 flasks (Corning) by a rinse twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and incubation with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA in Hank's balanced salts solution (BioWhittaker) for 3 min at 37°C prior to resuspension in growth medium. The media contained 50 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 IU/ml penicillin, and cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/air. Transfections in BAEC were carried out in 100-mm Petri dishes using 10 μg of plasmid construct and the modified calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (Sambrook et al., 1989). The cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of pTKGH (Nichols Institute Diagnostics) to correct for transfection efficiency. After incubation overnight at 37°C and 3% CO2/air, the monolayers were washed twice with Hank's balanced salts solution and incubated with or without PMA (Sigma) for a further 24 h at 5% CO2/air. Prior to harvest, the conditioned media were sampled for human growth hormone by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). CAT activity in the cell lysates was assessed by the two-phase fluor-diffusion technique (Sambrook et al., 1989). BAEC monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C and removed from plates by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. The suspension was repelleted using a microfuge at 6500 rpm for 20 s at 4°C. The cells were lysed by incubation in buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 200 mM sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) for 5 min at 4°C. The suspension was recentrifuged, and the crude nuclei were washed with buffer A prior to lysis in buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The nuclear extract was clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was combined 1:1 with buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 8, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C until use. Recombinant Sp1, purified from HeLa cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus containing human Sp1 cDNA, was obtained from Promega and stored in 12 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 μM ZnSO4, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, and 50% glycerol. Recombinant Egr-1 (zinc-finger region) in 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 μM ZnSO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol (Rauscher et al., 1990) was generously provided by Dr F. J. Rauscher, III (Wistar Institute, PA). Binding reactions involving nuclear extracts were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of extract, 1 μg of poly(dI•dC)-poly(dI•dC) (Sigma), 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), 5% sucrose, and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (50,000-100,000 cpm) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM PMSF. The reaction was allowed to continue for 30 min at 22°C. In supershift studies, 1 μl of the appropriate affinity-purified rabbit anti-peptide antibody (Santa Cruz) was incubated with the binding mixture for 10 min at 22°C prior to the addition of the probe. Binding reactions involving recombinant proteins were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (50,000-100,000 cpm). Bound complexes were separated from the free probe by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 1 × TBE running buffer. The gels were run at 200 V (constant voltage) for approximately 2 h and then dried under vacuum and autoradiographed overnight using Kodak X-OMAT-AR film. A single end-labeled fragment spanning the proximal PDGF-A promoter was prepared by digesting construct pPACCATΔXho with Eco47III and HindIII, dephosphorylating the ends with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and isolating the 135-bp fragment by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and Qiagen bead purification. The fragment was γ32P-labeled at both ends with T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified using spin columns. Following digestion with NaeI, the 112-bp fragment was purified using a 3% agarose gel and beads. The probe was designated [32P]-A. Guanine ladders were generated by methylation of the probe with dimethyl sulfate (Aldrich) and subsequent piperidine (Sigma) cleavage. Binding reactions using [32P]-A were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2 μg of poly(dI•dC)-poly(dI•dC) (Sigma), 0.5% sucrose in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 mM PMSF and increasing amounts of recombinant protein. Following an incubation for 1 h at 4°C, 20 μl of DNase buffer (25 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2) containing 0.02 units of DNase I (Promega) was added and allowed to digest for 5 min at this temperature. 10 μl of stop solution (150 mM EDTA, 5% SDS, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) was added to each tube, and phenol/chloroform was extracted prior to DNA precipitation with absolute ethanol. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, evaporated to dryness, and resuspended in sequencing sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 2 min and applied to an 8% sequencing gel and run at 1500 V. The gels were dried and autoradiographed overnight at -80°C. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol® reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA samples (15 μg) were separated on 1% formaldehyde/agarose gels, transferred to a Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham), then hybridized with cDNA that had been labeled with [α32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN). The blot was washed with 0.5 × SSC at 65°C and exposed at -80°C. To determine the temporal pattern with which the PDGF-A gene is expressed in endothelial cells exposed to PMA, bovine aortic endothelial cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml PMA for various times, and steady-state mRNA levels were assessed by Northern blot analysis. The major 2.8-kilobase PDGF A-chain transcript was virtually undetectable in untreated cells (Fig. 1). However, significant hybridization was detected following 2-4 h of exposure to PMA. PDGF A-chain transcript levels remained elevated for 16 h before returning to control levels by 24 h (Fig. 1). To define the minimal promoter region that mediates basal expression in cultured endothelial cells, BAEC were transiently transfected with reporter constructs bearing nested 5′-deletions of the PDGF-A promoter fused to CAT cDNA. Cells that were transfected with constructs pACCATΔXho, e33, and f28 (bearing 262, 110, and 71 bp of promoter sequence relative to the transcriptional start site, respectively) expressed significant levels of the reporter (Fig. 2), whereas construct f36 (-55 bp) was inactive (Fig. 2). Maximum reporter activity was obtained using construct e33 (Fig. 2). These data indicate that the minimal PDGF-A promoter region required for optimal gene expression in cultured endothelial cells consists of approximately 110 bp. PMA-induced CAT activity was detected in cells that were transfected with constructs pACCATΔXho, e33, and f28 (Fig. 2). Construct f36, however, was unable to mediate PMA-inducible gene expression (Fig. 2). The sequence between the 5′-deletion end points of f28 and f36 corresponds to a G+C-rich element that contains overlapping consensus nucleotide recognition sequences for the zinc-finger transcription factors Sp1 and Egr-1 (Fig. 3A). Cotransfection studies indicate that constructs e33 and f28 respond to overexpressed Sp1 and Egr-1, whereas f36 does not. 2L. M. Khachigian, A. J. Williams, and T. Collins, unpublished observations. Thus, basal and PMA-induced expression mediated by the PDGF-A promoter in endothelial cells requires the proximal G+C-rich element and may involve the participation of Sp1 and/or Egr-1. The relative increase in reporter activity in response to PMA is consistent with -fold increases in CAT activity reported elsewhere (Angel et al., 1988; Fazio et al., 1991; John et al., 1995). PMA has been reported to induce the expression of Egr-1 in a variety of cell types (Esposito et al., 1994; Kanazashi et al., 1994; Larsen et al., 1994). However, the expression of Egr-1 by endothelial cells has not yet been reported. Northern blot analysis was performed to determine whether PMA could modulate the expression of Egr-1 and/or Sp1. PMA dramatically induced steady-state Egr-1 transcript levels in BAEC within 1 h of exposure (Fig. 1). Egr-1 mRNA levels remained elevated for 16 h and returned to control levels by 24 h (Fig. 1). In contrast, Sp1 is constitutively expressed and unaffected by exposure to PMA over 24 h (Fig. 1). These findings indicate that the induction of Egr-1 transcript expression by PMA precedes that of the PDGF A-chain. Western blot analysis revealed that PMA also increased PDGF A-chain and Egr-1 expression at the level of protein, whereas constitutive levels of Sp1 were unaffected.2 To determine whether PMA could induce an interaction between proteins from endothelial nuclei and the proximal PDGF-A promoter, EMSA was performed using a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide bearing the G+C-rich sequence (Oligo A, Fig. 3A). Using nuclear extracts from unstimulated BAEC, two prominent nucleoprotein complexes (A1 and A5) and two minor complexes with variable intensity (A2 and A4) were formed. All of these complexes were specifically competed by the presence of 50-100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled cognate in the binding reaction (Fig. 3B). The intensity of A5 suggests that the proteins involved in this complex are present in relatively large amounts in endothelial nuclei. An oligonucleotide bearing a consensus site for the ETS-class transcription factor, PEA-3, did not compete with these complexes at 100-fold molar excess.2 A single PMA-induced nucleoprotein complex was observed when 32P-oligonucleotide A was incubated with nuclear extracts from BAEC exposed to 100 ng/ml of PMA for 1 h (A3, Fig. 3B). Complex A3 was specifically competed by 50-fold molar excess of the oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B). Complexes A1, A2, A4, and A5 were unaffected by the presence of PMA (Fig. 3B). To determine the temporal pattern of PMA-induced DNA binding activity, 32P-oligonucleotide A was incubated with nuclear extracts from endothelial cells exposed to PMA for various times. The dramatic induction of complex A3 was sustained over 4 h, and levels remained elevated after 12 h before returning to control levels by 24 h (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the time course with which complex A3 appears is remarkably similar to the pattern of Egr-1 mRNA expression induced by PMA (Fig. 1). Polyclonal antipeptide antibodies were used to determine the identity of the nuclear protein(s) involved in the PMA-induced complex. A complete supershift of complex A3 was obtained using antibodies directed toward Egr-1 (Fig. 3D). Thus, Egr-1 interacts with the PDGF-A G+C-rich element in cultured endothelial cells within 1 h of exposure to PMA. AP-2 and WT-1 are zinc-finger transcription factors that interact with the G+C-rich nucleotide sequences, 5′-(C/T)(C/G)(C/G)CC(C/A)N(G/C)(G/C)(G/C)-3′ (Imagawa et al., 1987; Williams et al., 1989) and 5′-GCGTGGGAGT-3′ (Nakagama et al., 1995), respectively. Antibodies to AP-2, WT-1, or to PEA-3, however, failed to produce a supershift (Fig. 3D). The constitutive expression of Sp1 in endothelial cells (Fig. 1) suggests that this transcription factor occupies the G+C-rich element in the absence of PMA. Supershift analysis was used to determine whether nuclear Sp1 does indeed occupy this element in cultured BAEC. In unstimulated cells, polyclonal antipeptide antibodies directed toward Sp1 partially supershifted complex A1 (Fig. 4). Upon exposure to PMA, however, Egr-1 bound to the promoter fragment, and the Sp1 supershift was no longer apparent (Fig. 4). Antibodies to Ets-1 or Ets-2 had no effect (Fig. 4). These data indicate that PMA can affect the nature of the transcription factors interacting with this region of the promoter. Egr-1 interacts with the G+C-rich element in the PDGF-A promoter by displacing Sp1 in endothelial cells exposed to PMA. The inability of the Sp1 antibody to completely supershift complex A1 may be due to one or a combination of several possibilities: first, partial recognition of bovine Sp1 using the anti-human Sp1 antibody; second, comigration of a nucleoprotein complex unrelated to Sp1; and third, incomplete recognition due to the phosphorylation state of Sp1 (reviewed in Imagawa et al. (1987)). Partial supershifts involving the same Sp1 antibody used in this study have been reported elsewhere (Kramer et al., 1994; Minowa et al., 1994; Jensen et al., 1995). Recombinant proteins were used to further document the interaction of Sp1 and Egr-1 with the G+C-rich element in the proximal PDGF-A promoter. Both Sp1 (Fig. 5A) and Egr-1 (Fig. 5B) bound to 32P-oligonucleotide A in a dose-dependent and specific manner. The appearance of higher order complexes at higher concentrations of Sp1 or Egr-1 (Fig. 5, A and B) indicates that more than one molecule, either Sp1 or Egr-1, may bind simultaneously to the oligonucleotide. Inspection of the nucleotide sequence in oligonucleotide A (Fig. 3A) indicates the presence of more than one putative binding site for each protein. Higher order complexes could also result from direct protein-protein interactions (Pascal and Tjian, 1991). In vitro DNase I footprinting provided further evidence for the interaction of Egr-1 with the G+C-rich element in the proximal PDGF-A promoter. Egr-1 protected this region from partial digestion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Sequences protected by Egr-1 beyond the actual binding site (Rauscher et al., 1990) may reflect weak binding of Egr-1 to adjacent G+C-rich sequences or conformational changes induced by bound Egr-1. To provide an indication of the stability of the nucleoprotein complexes involving Sp1 and Egr-1 over time, EMSA was carried out using the running gel technique (Franzoso et al., 1993). Recombinant Sp1 was incubated with 32P-oligonucleotide A for 30 min at 22°C and applied to a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel following various times. The Sp1-32P-oligonucleotide A complex was apparent even after 150 min at this temperature (Fig. 5D). Addition of 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide A displaced Sp1 from 32P-oligonucleotide A within 30 min (Fig. 5D). When recombinant Egr-1 was used instead of Sp1, the nucleoprotein complex was similarly apparent after 150 min (Fig. 5E). Unlike Sp1, however, addition of excess unlabeled oligonucleotide A resulted only in partial displacement of the prebound Egr-1 (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that both Sp1 and Egr-1 bind to the PDGF-A oligonucleotide in a stable manner. The apparent off-rate of Egr-1, however, is slower than that of Sp1. The preceding results indicate that PMA-induced Egr-1 interacts with the G+C-rich element in the PDGF-A core promoter and that levels of Sp1 were unaffected in endothelial cells exposed to PMA. We hypothesized that Egr-1, induced by PMA, could displace Sp1 from this element in the promoter. Using recombinant proteins and the running gel technique, the effect of adding a 40-fold molar excess of Egr-1 (relative to Sp1) to a solution containing prebound Sp1-32P-oligonucleotide A was the displacement of Sp1 within 30 min (Fig. 6A). Moreover, when the 32P-labeled footprint probe was allowed to bind to a fixed amount of Sp1 for 10 min and was subsequently challenged with increasing concentrations of Egr-1, Sp1 was displaced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Thus, Egr-1 is able to displace Sp1 from the G+C-rich element in the proximal PDGF-A promoter. To determine whether the interaction of Egr-1 with the G+C-rich element is necessary for inducible expression driven by the PDGF-A promoter, the oligonucleotide was mutated by the insertion of 3 guanines into the core sequence. When the mutant oligonucleotide, Oligo Am, was 32P-radiolabeled and used in EMSA, Egr-1 could no longer interact with the promoter sequence (Fig. 7A). Native and mutant A-chain promoter sequences were introduced into a heterologous promoter-reporter construct and transiently transfected into BAEC. Cells transfected with the wild-type construct expressed 5-6-fold greater CAT activity when exposed to PMA for 24 h (Fig. 7B). In contrast, CAT activity did not increase in cells transfected with the mutant construct (Fig. 7B). Similarly, expression driven by the wild-type sequence increased by 5-fold when BAEC were cotransfected with CMV.Egr-1 (Fig. 7C). However, the mutant failed to respond to overexpressed Egr-1 (Fig. 7C). These findings demonstrate the requirement of an intact Egr-1 site in the proximal PDGF-A promoter sequence for expression inducible either by PMA or overexpressed Egr-1. The present report indicates that the induction of PDGF A-chain expression in endothelial cells by PMA involves the interplay of zinc-finger transcription factors with elements in the core promoter. A schematic representation of these events appears in Fig. 8. Several lines of evidence support this model. First, 5′-deletion analysis of the PDGF-A promoter indicates that Sp1 elements are required for basal expression in endothelial cells (Fig. 2), consistent with findings in other cell types (Kaetzel et al., 1994; Lin et al., 1992). The actual number of Sp1 sites required for basal activity is not clear. However, single point mutations in individual putative Sp1 sites did not reduce PDGF-A promoter activity, 3T. Collins and D. T. Bonthron, unpublished observations. suggesting that not all Sp1 sites are required for basal expression. Second, recombinant Sp1 interacts with the G+C-rich element in a specific (Fig. 5A), dose-dependent (Fig. 5A) (Kim et al., 1989), and stable manner (Fig. 5D). Third, EMSA, using nuclear extracts from unstimulated cells, indicates that the G+C-rich element in the proximal PDGF-A promoter is occupied by Sp1 (Fig. 4). Finally, the constitutive expression of Sp1 transcript (Fig. 1) and protein2 is not affected by PMA. Sp1, which was first identified in HeLa cells by virtue of its ability to activate the SV40 early promoter (Dynan and Tjian, 1983), mediates the basal expression of the structurally similar PDGF-B gene in cultured endothelial cells (Khachigian et al., 1994). Upon exposure of endothelial cells to PMA, Egr-1 is induced and binds to the G+C-rich element in the proximal promoter by displacing Sp1. Several findings support this part of the model (Fig. 8). First, EMSA and in vitro DNase I footprinting studies indicate that like Sp1, recombinant Egr-1 interacts with the G+C-rich element in a specific (Fig. 5B), dose-dependent (Fig. 5, B and C), and stable (Fig. 5E) manner. The number of functional Egr-1 sites required for induced PDGF-A expression is not clear. Second, Egr-1 mRNA is dramatically induced in endothelial cells within minutes of exposure to PMA (Fig. 1). Third, the time course of induction of Egr-1 mRNA is virtually identical to appearance of the nucleoprotein complex A3 (Fig. 3C). Fourth, supershift analysis indicates that PMA-induced Egr-1 attenuates the ability of Sp1 to interact with the promoter (Fig. 4). Finally, a molar excess of Egr-1 can displace prebound Sp1 from this region (Fig. 6, A and B). It is unlikely that Egr-1 and Sp1 interact simultaneously with the G+C-rich element in the proximal PDGF-A promoter. The presence of both Egr-1 and Sp1 in the same EMSA reaction does not result in a super complex (Fig. 6, A and B), and antibodies to Egr-1 or Sp1 do not supershift a single band from endothelial cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 4). Collectively, these findings indicate that PMA-induced Egr-1 stimulates gene expression driven by the PDGF-A promoter in endothelial cells by displacement of Sp1 from the G+C-rich element. The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the return of PDGF-A transcript mRNA to basal levels following induction by PMA are unclear. It is tempting to speculate, however, that one or more of the following transcriptional events may be involved. First, the transient increase in Egr-1 transcript (Fig. 1), protein,2 and DNA binding activity (Fig. 3B) suggests that Sp1 may reoccupy the G+C-rich element when the stoichiometric ratio of Sp1 to Egr-1 returns to preinduction levels, greatly favoring Sp1. Second, Egr-1 could be actively displaced by a third transcription factor such as WT-1. Recombinant WT-1 has been shown previously to interact with the same G+C-rich element in the proximal PDGF-A promoter (Gashler et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1992b). We did not detect a nucleoprotein complex involving endothelial WT-1 by supershift analysis; however, a WT-1-like transcription factor may be involved in the post-induction transcriptional repression of PDGF-A. Finally, other regulatory proteins could displace Egr-1 from the G+C-rich element via direct protein-protein interactions. For example, the activation of creatine kinase gene expression by WT-1 is repressed by physical association with p53 (Maheswaran et al., 1993). Interestingly, an active transcriptional repression mechanism has also been suggested in the down-regulation of PDGF-A gene expression after serum stimulation (Takimoto and Kuramoto, 1995). The regulatory events presented in this manuscript indicate that the complex process of transcriptional activation can involve the interchange of transcription factors associating with distinct promoter elements (Tjian and Maniatis, 1994). Interestingly, overlapping putative nucleotide recognition elements for Egr-1 and Sp1 appear in the promoters of human tissue factor (Mackman et al., 1989), transforming growth factor-β1 (Kim et al., 1989; Dey et al., 1994), colony-stimulating factor-1 (Harrington et al., 1993), tumor necrosis factor (Kramer et al., 1994), murine thrombospondin-1 (Shingu and Bornstein, 1994), acetylcholinesterase (Mutero et al., 1995), and in the Egr-1 promoter itself (Cao et al., 1993). Although binding and cotransfection studies have implied a functional role for Sp1 and Egr-1 in the regulation of certain of these genes, actual competition between these factors has not been demonstrated. Accordingly, the exchange of Sp1 and Egr-1 at overlapping motifs may be an important common event in the control of inducible gene expression. We thank Drs. David T. Bonthron (Human Genetics Unit, University of Edinburgh, Scotland) for generously providing certain PDGF-A promoter-reporter deletion constructs, Vikas P.

Programmed cell death is conserved throughout evolution as a strategy employed by multicellular organisms to regulate a wide range of physiological processes including embryo development, tissue remodelling, immune system development and cellular responses to infection, and tumorigenesis. Cell death can be triggered by a variety of stimuli that can ultimately lead to characteristic changes in the cell, frequently resulting in chromatin fragmentation and condensation, membrane blebbing, and collapse of the nucleus, a process called apoptosis(1Kerr J.F.R.

Within the immune system, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factor αICEinterleukin 1β converting enzymePAI-2plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2uPAurokinase-type plasminogen activatorbpbase pairCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePBSphosphate-buffered salinekbkilobase pair(s)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayMTT3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideCMVcytomegalovirus. is an important effector of programmed cell death, playing a role in immune defense against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections with the ability to target tumor cells and virus-infected cells(3Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 199-212Google Scholar, 4Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Google Scholar). The initial events involved in TNF-induced cell death occur through the 55-kDa TNF receptor (5Tartaglia L.A. Weber R.F. Figari I.S. Reynolds C. Palladino Jr., M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9292-9296Google Scholar, 6Tartaglia L.A. Rothe M. Hu Y.-F. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 73: 213-216Google Scholar) with the subsequent signal transduction events being the subject of intense investigation(7Higuchi M. Higashi N. Nishimura Y. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Mol.

However, the specific cellular death pathway(s) triggered by TNF and their relationships to other effector-induced apoptotic cell death mechanisms are not well understood. tumor necrosis factor α interleukin 1β converting enzyme plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 urokinase-type plasminogen activator base pair chloramphenicol acetyltransferase phosphate-buffered saline kilobase pair(s) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide cytomegalovirus. An evolutionary approach to the elucidation of mechanisms involved in cell death has led to the finding that cell death can be mediated, at least in part, by proteinases. The cell death gene, ced-3 from Caenorhabditis elegans, and its human homologue, the cysteine proteinase interleukin 1β converting enzyme (ICE), cause cell death when expressed in rodent fibroblasts(9Muira M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Google Scholar). Serine proteinases are implicated in cell death induced by TNF, in that low molecular weight serine proteinase inhibitors protect tumor cells from the cytotoxic effects of TNF(10Suffys P. Beyaert R. VanRoy F. Fiers W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 257-265Google Scholar, 11Ruggiero V. Johnson S.E. Baglioni C. Cell Immunol. 1987; 107: 317-325Google Scholar). More recently, the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin), plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI-2), was reported to confer protection from TNF-mediated cytolysis when overexpressed in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells(12Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20960-20964Google Scholar). PAI-2 is a major product of monocytes and macrophages in response to inflammatory mediators(13Schwartz B.S. Monroe M.C. Levin E.G. Blood. 1988; 71: 734-741Google Scholar, 14Gyetko M.R. Shollenberger S.B. Sitrin R.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 51: 256-263Google Scholar). PAI-2 was originally described as an inhibitor of the serine proteinase, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)(15Kawano T. Mormoto K. Uemura Y. J. Biochem. 1970; 67: 333-342Google Scholar, 16Golder J.P. Stephens R.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 253-258Google Scholar). uPA specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of a single Arg-Val bond in the widely distributed zymogen, plasminogen, to form plasmin, a broad spectrum serine proteinase that is capable of hydrolyzing a number of protein substrates(17Dano K. Andreason P. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Neilson L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Google Scholar). uPA has a well established role in cellular invasion and is involved in degradation of extracellular matrices and tissue remodelling(17Dano K. Andreason P. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Neilson L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Google Scholar, 18Testa J.E. Quigley J.P. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 353-367Google Scholar). uPA has also been reported to function as a cellular growth factor (19Kirchheimer J.C. Wojta J. Christ G. Binder B.R. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 125-128Google Scholar, 20de Petro G. Copeta A. Barlati S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 286-294Google Scholar) and to participate in the activation of hepatocyte growth factor(21Naldini L. Tamagnone L. Vigna E. Sachs M. Hartmann G. Birchmeier W. Daikuhara Y. Tsubouchi H. Blasi F. Comoflio P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4825-4833Google Scholar), but its potential role in cell death is not known. In HT1080 tumor cells, uPA and PAI-2 are synthesized constitutively(12Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20960-20964Google Scholar), and it is not possible to ascertain from this model whether the presence of uPA is intrinsic to the protective effect demonstrated by overexpression of PAI-2. In the present paper, we report that expression of PAI-2 protects from TNF-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, a cell line that does not synthesize PAI-2 or significant levels of uPA and that is sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TNF. Protection by PAI-2 is independent of extracellular uPA activity and is likely to involve an intracellular cell death proteinase. HeLa cells (ATCC-CLL 2) and MonoMac6 cells (22Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Thiel E. Futterer A. Herzog V. Wirtz A. Reithmuller G. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 456-461Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Prof. H. W. L. Ziegler-Heitbrock, University of Munich) were incubated in a 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere at 37°C and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamate, 25 mM HEPES buffer, 60 μg/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. All cultures were checked routinely and determined to be mycoplasma free. An 1867-bp DNA fragment encoding PAI-2 cDNA was excised from pJ7/PAI-2 (23Schleuning W.D. Medcalf R.L. Hession C. Rothenbujler R. Shaw A. Kruithof E.K.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 12: 4564-4567Google Scholar) with EcoRI, end-filled, and inserted into the end-filled HindIII site of pRcCMV (Invitrogen). Both orientations were obtained to create sense and antisense PAI-2 expression constructs. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) cDNA gene was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a 785-bp region of pCATBasic (Promega) using the following polymerase chain reaction primers, and the resultant DNA fragment was cloned into the HindIII site of pRcCMV: CAT primer forward, 5′-GGCGAAGCTTCAGGCGTTTA-3′, and CAT primer reverse, 5′-TACGCCAAGCTTGCATGCCT-3′. The P1 site mutant of PAI-2 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification and overlap extension following the method of Ho et al.(24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). The following synthesized oligonucleotides were used to alter the nucleotides at 1186-1192, resulting in a mutation at Arg-380 (to Ala-380), and to generate a unique Nar1 restriction enzyme site (see Fig. 6A): Primer A, 5′-GGCTCAGATTCTAGAACTCC-3′; Primer B, 5′-GTATTTCTAGAAATGCACATAAC-3′; Primer C, 5′-GACAGGCGCCACTGGACATGG-3′; and Primer D, 5′-CCATGTCCAGTGGCGCCTGT-3′. Primers A and B and Primers C and D, respectively, were combined to generate DNA fragments containing overlapping mutations at nucleotides 1186-1192 in the PAI-2 cDNA gene. These DNA fragments were then combined, and Primers A and D were used to generate a 988-bp DNA fragment extending between the XbaI restriction enzyme sites at positions 790 and 1778 of PAI-2 cDNA. This DNA fragment was cloned into the corresponding XbaI sites of pJ7/PAI-2 following excision of the 988-bp DNA fragment containing the native sequence at the P1 site. The sense orientation was identified by restriction enzyme mapping, and the DNA sequence of the mutant construct was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Approximately 1 × 107 HeLa cells in log phase were electroporated with 20 μg of plasmid DNA at 250 V, 960 microfarads in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Following culture for 16 h, transfectants were selected with 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual clones were maintained routinely in 0.3 mg/ml G418. Expression of the transgene was determined by Northern and immunoblot analyses. Near confluent, adherent cultures were harvested by gentle scraping and washed by resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Total RNA was isolated from harvested cells using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Each RNA sample (10 μg) was electrophoresed on denaturing agarose gels containing 1.1% formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.) by capillary diffusion, and fixed by UV irradiation according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were hybridized essentially as described (26Antalis T.M. Dickinson J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 203-209Google Scholar) and washed to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C. The blots were probed with a 2.0-kb HindIII-EcoRI DNA fragment encoding PAI-2 cDNA(27Antalis T.M. Clark M.R. Barnes T. Lehrbach P.R. Devine P.L. Schevzov G. Goss N.H. Stephens R.W. Tolstoshev P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 985-989Google Scholar), the 785-bp CAT DNA fragment, or pRcCMV (for the vector alone transfectants). Plasmids containing cDNA probes for the 55- and 70-kDa TNF receptors were obtained from Dr. David Lowen (Syntex USA, Palo Alto, CA), and manganese superoxide dismutase cDNA (28Fujii J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23142-23146Google Scholar) was from Prof. N. Taniguchi (Osaka Medical School and Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc.). Each DNA fragment was radiolabeled by the random priming method(29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar). The blots were rehybridized with a labeled human 18 S rRNA oligonucleotide as a measure of total RNA loaded in each lane (26Antalis T.M. Dickinson J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 203-209Google Scholar). The blots were exposed to Kodak XK-1 film between Dupont Cronex intensifying screens at -70°C for varying times and quantitated by scanning different exposures of autoradiographs using a scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) driven by ImageQuant software. For immunoblot analyses, cells were washed three times in PBS and harvested by gentle scraping into PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed quickly on ice in cold PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, and 20 μg/ml of the proteinase inhibitor, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, except where indicated in the figure legends. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting cell lysate stored in aliquots at -70°C. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. The solubilized proteins (40-80 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions using a 5-15% acrylamide gradient gel, and the proteins were electrophoretically blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for 16 h at 30 V. Specific antigens were detected by incubation of the membrane at room temperature for 1 h with 1 μg/ml of either the anti-catalytic, anti-uPA monoclonal antibody (American Diagnostica #394), the anti-PAI-2 monoclonal antibody (American Diagnostica #3750), the anti-CAT monoclonal antibody (5 Prime → 3 Prime Inc. #5307-310127), or the anti-bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Sciences #OP60). Antibody binding was visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were exposed to Kodak XK-1 film for various times and quantitated using a scanning densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) as described above. Quantitation of PAI-2 levels by ELISA was carried out using the Tintelize PAI-2 ELISA kit (#220220) from American Diagnostica. Cytolysis was quantitated by two methods: 1) crystal violet staining (modified from (12Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20960-20964Google Scholar)), which measures cell survival as a function of cell adherence, and 2) the tetrazolium dye-based MTT assay(30Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar), which provides a measure of cell viability. Cells were seeded at 104 cells/well in triplicate in 96-well plates for 16 h prior to treatment with the following agents for 8 h in the standard assay: TNF, 0-50 ng/ml as indicated in the text, and cycloheximide, 10 μg/ml. Cycloheximide was not cytotoxic at the concentrations used within the time frame of the experiments. For assay by crystal violet staining, the cells were washed in PBS and stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 10% ethanol or 10% formaldehyde. The dye was eluted with 33% acetic acid, and the absorbance was measured at 480 nm. For measurement by MTT assay, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.4 μg/ml/well and incubated for 4 h. Plates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and supernatant was removed. MTT crystals were dissolved in Me2SO, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. For the experiments involving addition of anti-TNF or anti-uPA antibodies, the cells were washed three times in serum-free RPMI 1640, and the antibodies were added in RPMI 1640 containing 10% acid-treated fetal calf serum at the concentrations given in the figure legends. Cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of antibody prior to treatment with TNF and/or cycloheximide. Competitive (#042) and noncompetitive (#047) anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Peptide Technology Ltd. (Sydney, Australia). Cells were plated in triplicate at 2 × 105/well in 24-well culture plates (Linbro, Flow) and allowed to adhere overnight. The plates were then placed on ice, washed with binding medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum), and incubated with 0.3 ml of cold binding medium containing 0.22 nM I125-labeled human recombinant TNF (105 dpm/well, 15-30 TBq/mmol, Amersham Australia). Selected wells also contained a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled TNF (Pharma Biotechnologie, Hannover). After 1 h on ice, the monolayers were washed three times with binding medium prior to extraction with 0.5 M NaOH for 48 h prior to γ scintillation counting. Cell numbers were determined by trypsinization of identically treated monolayers run in parallel with the binding studies. Cells were seeded at 103 cells/well and cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum for 16 h on sterile glass coverslips in 24-well plates. The media was removed and replaced with media alone or media containing 10 ng/ml TNF and/or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide and incubated for 4 h. Staining was performed essentially as described by Chen (31) using Hoechst stain 33258 (Sigma) at 0.1 μg/ml. Coverslips were mounted in 50% glycerol in citrate phosphate buffer (0.1 M citrate and 0.2 M Na2HPO4, pH 5.5), and the nuclei were visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/well in a 24-well plate, allowed to adhere for 16 h, and where indicated treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) and/or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). Following incubation for 5 h, the cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 800 mM NaCl, and 4 mM EDTA. SDS was added to a final concentration of 1%, proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The DNA was precipitated from the supernatants with 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol. The recovered DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide. Binding reactions were carried out at for 10 min at 4°C with approximately 5 × 103 cpm of radiolabeled NFκB probe, 3 μg of poly(dI•dC), and 1 μg of nuclear extract under the following reaction conditions: 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mM EDTA, 75 mM NaCl, 20 μg bovine serum albumin, 7.5% glycerol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and 1.5 mM dithiothreitol). Synthesized single stranded oligonucleotides containing the NFκB binding site were annealed and end-filled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (1000 Ci/mmol). The primers used were as follows: NFκBMain, 5′-ACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCC-3′, and NFκBPri: 5′-GGAAAGTGAGCAGCGG-3′. For competition experiments, excess unlabeled double stranded NFκB probe was incubated with nuclear extract in the presence of radiolabeled probe at 0°C for 10 min. DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run at 11 V/cm in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris borate and 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.2). ICE activity was measured essentially as described(32Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 107) from HeLa, S1a, A2/7, and the THP-1 monocytic cell line (positive control) were lysed in 0.5 ml of hypotonic buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was brought to 10% sucrose and 0.1% Triton X-100 and stored at -20°C. For the ICE assay, 50 μl of cell extract was incubated in the presence of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 μM ICE fluorogenic substrate Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-AMC (peptide 17(32Thornberry N.A.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Google Scholar), where AMC is amino-4-methylcoumarin) for 2 h. The ICE fluorogenic substrate was prepared by conventional solution-phase peptide synthesis (Auspep, Parkville, Victoria Australia). ICE activity ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 nmoles amino-4-methylcoumarin released per hr/mg of protein for both PAI-2-expressing and -nonexpressing cells. To generate sense and antisense PAI-2 cDNA, a DNA fragment containing the entire PAI-2 coding sequence and 3′-untranslated region was inserted in two orientations into the expression vector, pRcCMV, under control of the constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. As a positive control for an irrelevant gene, the coding sequence for the CAT gene was inserted into the same vector. HeLa cells were transfected with each of these constructs, as well as vector alone as a negative control, and stable transfectants were selected by resistance to G418. A range of stable clones were isolated from each transfection and analyzed for expression of the transgene by Northern and immunoblot analyses. Each clone was found to express varying levels of transgene mRNA. Northern blots of a selection of sense PAI-2, antisense PAI-2, and CAT clones are shown in Fig. 1A. In the PAI-2 sense clones, two mRNA transcripts are detected that correspond to the mobilities predicted as a result of alternate use of 3′-untranslated sequences, one being the PAI-2 3′-untranslated region (1.9 kb) and the second being the bovine growth hormone 3′-untranslated sequence contained within pRcCMV (2.1 kb). The CAT mRNA transcript is detected at approximately 1.0 kb. Analysis of PAI-2 expression by immunoblot analysis shows that PAI-2 mRNA levels correlate with the synthesis of immunoreactive PAI-2 protein in the sense clones, with none detected in the antisense PAI-2 or vector alone control cell lines (Fig. 1B). The PAI-2 protein synthesized has a molecular mass of 47 kDa and migrates with the same mobility as native PAI-2 induced by lipopolysaccharide in the macrophage-like MonoMac6 cell line. A second minor band is detected beneath the 47-kDa PAI-2 band in both the sense PAI-2 clones and in the MonoMac6 cell lysates, which likely represents a PAI-2 proteolytic cleavage product. The amount of PAI-2 protein synthesized by each of the cell lines was quantitated by ELISA and was found to correlate with the levels detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B). Stable cell lines that had been transfected with the CAT gene produced the 80-kDa CAT protein(33Shaw W.V. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 737-755Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 1C. The PAI-2 synthesized by the cells was tested for biological activity demonstrated by the ability to react with uPA, the serine proteinase target of PAI-2. Interaction of uPA and PAI-2 results in the formation of an SDS-resistant complex that demonstrates altered mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or a characteristic “band shift” from 47 kDa to approximately 92 kDa(34Ragno P. Montuori N. Vassalli J.-D. Rossi G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 279-284Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1D, addition of purified uPA to cell lysates derived from PAI-2 transfectants results in such a band shift, demonstrating that the recombinant PAI-2 is biologically active. As has been observed with a number of cell types in vitro, HeLa cells are susceptible to cell death by TNF when protein synthesis is inhibited(35Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2464-2469Google Scholar). Each of the HeLa cell transfectants was treated with TNF in the presence of cycloheximide for 8 h, after which time the parental HeLa cell line showed evidence of extensive cell death. The amount of cell death was quantitated by two independent assays: 1) crystal violet staining, which monitors cell survival as a function of cell adherence, and 2) MTT assay, which provides a measure of viable cells. When assayed by either method, transfectants expressing PAI-2 (S1a, S1b) showed greater than 80% cell survival relative to antisense PAI-2 transfectants (A2/7, A2/17), cells transfected with vector alone (CMV), or cells transfected with CAT, each of which showed less than 30% survival over the 8-h time period (Fig. 2A). The cell death observed was not due to an effect of inhibition of protein synthesis, as treatment with cycloheximide alone had minimal effects on cell survival. The effect of TNF concentration on the sensitivity of the HeLa transfectants to cell death is shown in Fig. 2C. The PAI-2-expressing cell lines show enhanced survival at concentrations of TNF below 10 ng/ml but demonstrate less resistance to the cytolytic effects of TNF at higher concentrations of TNF. At 10 ng/ml the clones expressing the highest levels of PAI-2, S1a and S1b, were essentially resistant to TNF-induced cell death, as compared with antisense PAI-2, CAT, or CMV transfectants; whereas at 50 ng/ml TNF, S1a and S1b show approximately 50% survival compared with 25-30% for the control transfectants. Furthermore the resistance to TNF-induced cell death appears to correlate with the relative level of PAI-2 expressed by the transfected cells. Indeed, when the concentration of TNF required for 50% cell death for each of the sense PAI-2-expressing cell lines was plotted against the log of the concentration of PAI-2 expressed by each cell line (Fig. 2D), a linear relationship was obtained. That the cell death observed was a direct consequence of TNF action was demonstrated by comparing the effects of noncompetitive and competitive anti-TNF antibodies (which interfere with TNF binding to its receptor) on cell death (Fig. 3A). The PAI-2-expressing clone, S1a, and the antisense clone, A2/7, were incubated with increasing concentrations of each of the antibodies and then subjected to challenge with TNF and cycloheximide. Incubation with increasing concentrations of the competitive anti-TNF antibody resulted in increased survival of both the sense and the antisense clones, whereas the noncompetitive antibody had no significant effect on the relative survival of either clone. Therefore, PAI-2 demonstrates protection against cell death mediated directly through TNF. The inflammatory cytokine, interferon-γ, synergizes with TNF in the absence of cycloheximide to promote cell death(36Sugarman B.J. Aggarwal B.B. Hass P.E. Figari I.S. Palladino M.A. Shepard H.M. Science. 1985; 230: 943-945Google Scholar, 37Sugarman B.J. Lewis G.D. Eessalu T.E. Aggarwal B.B. Shepard H.M. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 780-786Google Scholar). Treatment of HeLa cells with interferon-γ alone has a cytostatic effect on HeLa cells, whereas treatment with TNF in the presence of interferon-γ results in approximately 90% cell death after 72 h. However, the PAI-2-expressing clones, S1a and S1b, were protected from TNF- and interferon-γ-mediated cell death, demonstrating 70-80% cell survival, relative to the control clones, A2/7, A2/17, CMV, and CAT transfectants (10-30% survival) as determined by both MTT (Fig. 2B) and crystal violet assays (data not shown). Interferon-γ treatment alone had a cytostatic effect on antisense and control transfectants similar to that observed in HeLa cells, whereas interferon-γ-treated PAI-2-expressing cells continued to grow during this period. A mechanism by which cells can become resistant to cytolysis mediated by TNF is through shedding of TNF receptors. Soluble TNF-binding proteins resulting from the proteolytic cleavage of TNF receptors can compete with the cell-associated receptors for TNF binding(38Olsson L. Gatanaga T. Gullberg U. Lantz M. Granger G.A. Eur. Cyotkine Netw. 1993; 4: 169-180Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the reduced sensitivity of PAI-2-expressing clones to TNF-induced cell death may be attributed to altered TNF receptor expression. Examination of TNF receptor mRNA levels in the sense and antisense transfectants by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3B) showed that although each transfectant expressed variable levels of 55-kDa TNF receptor mRNA, TNF receptor expression could not be correlated with the sensitivity of the clones to cell death. No 70-kDa TNF receptor mRNA was detected in any of the transfectants or the parental HeLa cell line (data not shown). The TNF receptors present on the transfected clones were"

Functional studies with IL-6 promoter demonstrated that three regions are the targets of the IFN-γ and/or TNF-α action, whereas only one of these regions seemed to be implicated in LPS activation. The three regions concerned are: 1) a region between -73 and -36, which is the minimal element inducible by LPS or TNF-α; 2) an element located between -181 and -73, which appeared to regulate the response to IFN-γ and TNF-α negatively; and 3) a distal element upstream of -224, which was inducible by IFN-γ alone. LPS signaling was found to involve NFκB activation by the p50/p65 heterodimers. Synergistic induction of the IL-6 gene by IFN-γ and TNF-α, in monocytic cells, involved cooperation between the IRF-1 and NFκB p65 homodimers with concomitant removal of the negative effect of the retinoblastoma control element present in the IL-6 promoter. This removal occurred by activation of the constitutive Sp1 factor, whose increased binding activity and phosphorylation were mediated by IFN-γ.

https://openalex.org/W1991691392,"The antifungal, immunosuppressive compound rapamycin arrests the cell cycle in G1 in both yeast cells and T-lymphocytes. Previous genetic studies in yeast identified mutations in three genes, FPR1 (FKBP12), TOR1, and TOR2, which confer rapamycin resistance, and genetic findings implicated the TOR proteins as direct targets of FKBP12-rapamycin. Consistent with this model, we find that modulating TOR1 and TOR2 expression alters rapamycin sensitivity. We describe several TOR2 mutations that confer rapamycin resistance. These mutations prevent FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TOR2, as assayed with the two-hybrid system. We find that TOR1 and the mammalian TOR homologue (mTOR) also bind FKBP12-rapamycin, and mutations corresponding to those in TOR2 similarly block FKBP12-rapamycin binding. We demonstrate that FKBP12 prolyl isomerase activity is not required for FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TOR and that a composite protein-drug surface contacts the TOR proteins. These studies confirm that the TOR proteins are direct targets of FKBP12-rapamycin, reveal that drug-resistant mutations prevent this association, and define structural features of these complexes.

Several studies have shown that rapamycin and the structurally related macrolide FK506 are mutually antagonistic inhibitors of T-cell activation(10Dumont F.J. Melino M.R. Staruch M.J. Koprak S.L.

The intracellular receptor for FK506 is the cytoplasmic 12-kDa cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase FKBP12 (for FK506 Binding Protein; Refs. 12 and 13). Prolyl isomerization is a rate-limiting step in protein folding, and two classes of enzymes catalyze this reaction, the FKBPs and cyclophilins. Despite their similar activity, cyclophilins and FKBPs share no homology; remarkably, though, cyclophilin A is the intracellular receptor for the immunosuppressant cyclosporin(14Takahashi N.

First, several FK506 analogs inhibit isomerase activity but are not immunosuppressive(18Bierer B.E. Somers P.K. Wandless T.J. Burakoff S.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1990; 250: 556-559Google Scholar, 19Sigal N.H. Dumont F. Durette P. Siekierka J.J. Peterson L. Rich D.H. Dunlap B.E. Staruch M.J. Melino M.R. Koprak S.L. Williams D. Witzel B. Pisano J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 619-628Google Scholar). Additionally, rapamycin is toxic to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but mutants lacking yeast FKBP12 (fpr1) are viable and drug resistant (20Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Google Scholar). The relevant target of both FK506 and cyclosporin, the Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin, was identified using FKBP12-FK506 and cyclophilin-cyclosporin affinity chromatography(16Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Google Scholar). Inhibition of calcineurin by these complexes prevents T-cell activation by blocking the nuclear import of the cytoplasmic subunit of NFAT, a transcription factor that regulates transcription of genes involved in T-cell activation(21McCaffrey P.G.

Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Google Scholar). TOR1 and TOR2 (for Target Of Rapamycin) encode large proteins related to phosphatidylinositol and protein kinases(24Helliwell S.B.

TOR2 is essential whereas TOR1 is not. Depletion of both TOR genes leads to a G1 cell cycle arrest resembling that imposed by rapamycin(20Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Google Scholar, 25Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Google Scholar). The genetic finding of nonallelic noncomplementation between tor1, tor2, and fpr1 mutations led to a model in which the FKBP12-rapamycin complex physically interacts with the TOR proteins(20Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Google Scholar), analogous to the interaction between FKBP12-FK506 and calcineurin. This model has recently been confirmed by the discoveries that TOR2 and the mammalian TOR homologue (mTOR, also known as FRAP, RAFT1, and RAPT1) bind FKBP12-rapamycin in vitro(27Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14 (in press)Google Scholar, 28Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-759Google Scholar, 29Sabatini D.M.

It is not yet clear how binding of FKBP12-rapamycin to TOR arrests the cell cycle. To characterize molecular interactions between FKBP12-rapamycin and TOR proteins, we identified additional rapamycin-resistant yeast mutants. We describe here several novel TOR2 mutations and employ the two-hybrid system to examine interactions between wild-type and mutant TORs and the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. Our studies confirm that the TORs physically interact with FKBP12-rapamycin, that TOR mutations confer rapamycin resistance by preventing this interaction, and that a composite FKBP12-rapamycin surface contacts TOR.

Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 176-187Google Scholar). Rapamycin stock solutions were prepared in 10% Tween 20 in ethanol. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method(36Schiestl R.H. Manivasakam P. Woods R.A. Gietz R.D. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 79-85Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was prepared as described (37Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Google Scholar). Yeast strains MLY10α (tor1::LEU2 TRP1 MATα), MLY11a (tor1::LEU2 HIS4 MATa), MLY58-3a (tor1::LEU2 tor2-1 TRP1 MATα), MLY60 (tor1::LEU2 tor2-1 HIS4 MATa), and MH346-1a (Δtor2::ADE2 Δade2 MATaTOR2-URA3-2μ) (25Kunz J.

Strain SMY4 (TOR1-3 fpr1::ADE2) was isogenic with two-hybrid host strain Y190 (38Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar) and has been described(39Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Google Scholar). 108 unmutagenized cells each of strains MLY10α+ pYJH23 (FPR1-URA3-2μ) and MLY11a + pYJH23 were seeded to SD-Ura medium with 10 ng/ml rapamycin and incubated for 3-7 days at 30°C. Mutations were identified as dominant or recessive by crossing to the parent (MLY10α or MLY11a). All mutations segregated 2R:2S for rapamycin resistance, indicating single nuclear mutations. TOR2 mutations were identified by the meiotic segregation pattern of rapamycin resistance following a cross to tor2-1 strains MLY58-3a or MLY60. DNA was sequenced with Sequenase 2.1 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Genomic DNA was directly sequenced with CircumVent (New England Biolabs). Except where indicated, PCR protocols were 5 min, 94°C; 35 × 30 s, 94°C; 30 s, 55°C; 1 min, 72°C; and a 5 min, 72°C extension. Standard PCR employed Taq polymerase and buffers. The long range PCR protocol was a modification of Barnes(40Barnes W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Google Scholar) : 1 min, 94°C; 35 × 5 s, 94°C; 30 s, 55°C; 10 min, 72°C using Δtaq (U. S.

Primers to PCR amplify TOR2 were 192, 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAATAGAGACTGACATATATGGCAGC-3′; 193, 5′-CTGGACATGCGCCCGCAGTTAGTAACGTCACGCTCGGAAC-3′; 301, 5′-AGCGCCTCGAGTACTAGTCGAAGGAACTTTTTTCGCAG-3′; 302, 5′-ATATGGATCCCAAATAATATGATAGCTCAAAGC-3′; 367, 5′-TTCTAGAATTCCATCAACCCAATC-3′; 368, 5′-CACGGATCCCGGGGACAGGCAATTC-3′. The primers to PCR amplify TOR1 were 370, 5′-CCGGAATTCATACATCAGCCAGATCCT-3′; 374, 5′-CGCGGATCCCAGGACCAGCCAATT-3′. The primers to PCR amplify mTOR were 398, 5′-CCGGAATTCGCAAGAATTGCAACGCCCAGAC-3′; 399, 5′-CGCGAATCCTGGCACAGCCAATTCAAG-3′. Primers to PCR amplify FPR1 were 84, 5′-TCGCCGGAATTCCCGGGG-3′; 85, 5′-CGCGCTGCAGGTCGACGGATCC-3′. GAL4(BD)-FKBP12 mutants R49I, F94V, and R49I,F94V have been described(39Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Google Scholar). The D48V mutation was created by PCR overlap mutagenesis (41Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) with plasmid pSBH1 (GAL4(BD)-FKBP12 wt) using primers 5′-TCCTCCGTTGTCAGGGGCTCTCC-3′ and 5′-GCCCCTGACAACGGAGGAATCG-3′ (mutations in bold) and flanking primers 84 and 85 (above). The PCR protocol was 30 × 30 s, 94°C; 30 s, 55°C; 30 s, 72°C followed by 5 min, 72°C. The product was cloned into the EcoRI-PstI sites of pGBT9 to create pSM12-1. The F43Y mutation was constructed similarly with primers 5′-GGCCAAAAATACGATTCCTCCGTTGAC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGAATCGTATTTTTGGCCGTTCTCC-3′ and flanking primers 84 and 85 (above), creating plasmid pSM14-3. Two-hybrid fusion plasmids were pGAD424 and pGBT9(42Fields S. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1993; 5: 116-124Google Scholar). GAL4(BD)-TOR21886-2081 plasmids were created by PCR amplification of the TOR2 locus from genomic DNA with primers 367 and 368 and cloning in-frame at the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pGBT9, creating plasmids pML62 (TOR2 wt), pML63 (TOR2-3, W2042L), pML64 (TOR2-5, F2049L), pML65 (TOR2-4, W2042C), pML66 (TOR2-2, S1975R), and pML67 (TOR2-1, S1975I). The GAL4(BD)-TOR21689-2486 wt fusion plasmid (pML53) was created by amplifying genomic DNA from strain JK9-3da with primers 301 and 302 (above) and cloning into the BamHI-SalI sites of pGBT9. GAL4(BD)-TOR21689-2081 (pML83) was created using primers 302 and 368 and cloning into the BamHI site of pGBT9. GAL4(BD)-TOR21886-2081 (pML77) was created with primers 301 and 367 and cloning into the EcoRI-SalI sites of pGBT9. The GAL4(AD)-FKBP12 plasmid was created by subcloning FPR1 from pSBH1 (39Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Google Scholar) into pGAD424. The GAL4(BD)-FKBP12 mutants described above were subcloned into pGAD424 to produce GAL4(AD)-FKBP12 plasmids pML68 (R49I), pML69 (F94V), pML70 (R49I F94V), pML71 (D48V), and pML73 (F43Y). The GAL4(BD)-TOR11883-2078 fusion plasmids were constructed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from strain JK9-3da (TOR1 wt) or R1 (TOR1-1, S1972R; (20Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Google Scholar)) using primers 370 and 374 (above) and cloning into pGBT9, producing plasmids pML80 (wt) and pML82 (S1972R). The GAL4(BD)-mTOR1945-2141 constructs were amplified from rat cDNA (wt) or a subclone bearing a site-directed mutation (S2035I; a gift of C. Alarcon) using primers 398 and 399 and cloning into pGBT9, producing plasmids pML88 (wt) and pML90 (S2035I). TOR2 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA using a long range PCR protocol (above) with primers 192 and 193 (above). The resulting products (~8.0 kb) were cloned into pRS315 (CEN LEU2; (43Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar)). Mutations in TOR2 mutant plasmids were mapped by exchanging restriction fragments with a wild-type clone (pML40). Restriction fragments used were a central 5.2-kb BglII piece, a 3.0-kb 3′-BamHI piece (including a BamHI site in the pRS315 polylinker), and a 3.2-kb 5′-SphI piece. The full-length and hybrid plasmids were tested for function by plasmid shuffle in strain MH346-1a. 5-FOAR colonies were tested for rapamycin resistance. A ~2.0-kb region (surrounding Ser-1975) conferred drug resistance, and the mutations were identified by sequencing. The plasmids used in the minimum inhibitory concentration experiment (Table 1) were pSEY18-TOR2 (2μ-URA3-TOR2; (25Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schneider U. Deuter-Reinhard M. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 585-596Google Scholar)) and pML48 (CEN URA3-TOR2), which was created by subcloning TOR2 from pML40 into plasmid pRS316(43Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar).TABLE I Open table in a new tab GAL4 fusion proteins were expressed in strain SMY4 and grown in 50 ml of SS-Leu-Trp (2% sucrose) to an A600~1.5. Cultures were pelleted and lysed by glass bead agitation in a bead beater in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl, 64 μM benzamidine, 1 μg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mM leupeptin, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 unit/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 5.1 mg total protein from each extract was diluted to 400 μl in lysis buffer and made 20% in trichloroacetic acid, then incubated on ice for 1 h. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the pellets were resuspended in trichloroacetic acid sample buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 11, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 3% SDS, 15% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Equivalent amounts of protein (corresponding to ~600 μg of protein) were fractionated by 10 and 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot with α-FKBP12(27Cardenas M.E.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2772-2783Google Scholar) as a loading control, using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described(39Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of two-hybrid strains co-expressing the fusion proteins were grown in SS-Leu-Trp (2% sucrose) medium at 30°C. Where indicated, rapamycin or FK506 were added in an equal volume of 10% Tween 20 in EtOH. As a genetic test of the model that TOR is the target of FKBP12-rapamycin, we examined the effects of altering TOR gene expression on rapamycin toxicity. Rapamycin sensitivity increased 4-fold in a strain lacking the nonessential TOR1 gene (Table 1). Overexpression of the essential TOR2 gene from low-copy or multi-copy plasmids increased rapamycin resistance by 2.5-20-fold (Table 1), while increasing FKBP12 had no effect (data not shown). These findings suggest the TOR proteins are limiting for FKBP12-rapamycin action and that TOR1 may compete with TOR2 for FKBP12-rapamycin. To further explore rapamycin action, we isolated rapamycin-resistant yeast mutants. We biased our screen to avoid reisolating mutations in two of the three genes known to confer drug resistance. First, because mutant strains lacking TOR1 are viable and rapamycin sensitive, we isolated mutants in a Δtor1 strain. Second, we included the FKBP12 gene on a multicopy plasmid to complement any recessive FKBP12 mutations. Third, we isolated mutants resistant to low drug concentrations (10 ng/ml) to include those conferring only partial resistance. With this screen we expected to isolate mutations in TOR2 and other genes involved in rapamycin toxicity. Spontaneous mutants resistant to 10 ng/ml rapamycin were isolated in two isogenic parental strains with convenient markers for genetic analyses (MLY10a and MLY11α, see “Materials and Methods”). TOR2 mutations usually confer dominant rapamycin resistance, precluding complementation tests. TOR2 mutations were identified by segregation analysis following a cross to a tor2-1 rapamycin-resistant mutant. In this cross, TOR2 mutations segregated 4R:0S at meiosis, whereas mutations unlinked to TOR2 exhibited 4R:0S, 3R:1S, and 2R:2S (in a 1:2:1 ratio) segregation events. In this screen, mutations in TOR2 and one other gene were identified. We characterize here the TOR2 mutations. Ten dominant TOR2 mutations were obtained. Growth of several mutants on medium containing rapamycin is shown in Fig. 1. Rapamycin-resistant mutations in yeast TOR1 and TOR2 have been previously identified at a conserved serine, Ser-1975 in TOR2 and Ser-1972 in TOR1(24Helliwell S.B. Wagner P. Kunz J. Deuter-Reinhard M.

TOR2 mutations at Ser-1975 were identified by cycle sequencing genomic DNA (see “Materials and Methods”). Three mutants had substitutions of Ser-1975, two to arginine and one to isoleucine, and were resistant to 1.0 μg/ml rapamycin. The remaining TOR2 mutations conferred only partial rapamycin resistance (Fig. 1). To identify these mutations, the TOR2 genes were amplified and cloned from genomic DNA by long range PCR (see “Materials and Methods”). The cloned TOR2 genes were shown to functionally complement, restoring viability and conferring rapamycin resistance, by a plasmid shuffle in a Δtor2 strain (see “Materials and Methods”). Restriction fragment exchange between mutant and wild-type TOR2 plasmid clones delimited the mutations to a 2-kb region surrounding Ser-1975. Sequence analysis identified single nucleotide changes resulting in substitutions of W2042L (3 times), W2042C(1Cardenas M.E. Lorenz M. Hemenway C. Heitman J. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1994; 2: 103-126Google Scholar), and F2049L (1Cardenas M.E. Lorenz M. Hemenway C. Heitman J. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1994; 2: 103-126Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The three identified residues, Ser-1975, Trp-2042, and Phe-2049, are all conserved between TOR1, TOR2, and mTOR. We next tested FKBP12-rapamycin binding to wild-type and mutant TOR2 proteins using the two-hybrid system. We fused the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4(BD)) to a small region of TOR2 (residues 1886-2081) that in both this and another study (32Stan R. McLaughlin M.M. Cafferkey R. Johnson R.K. Rosenberg M. Livi G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32027-32030Google Scholar) has been found to bind FKBP12-rapamycin in the two-hybrid system. The GAL4(BD)-TOR2 and GAL4(AD)-FKBP12 fusion proteins were co-expressed in a rapamycin-resistant, FKBP12-deficient two-hybrid host strain (SMY4, fpr1::ADE2 TOR1-3) to allow assays in the presence of rapamycin and to avoid competition by the abundant endogenous FKBP12. Rapamycin stimulated a complex between wild-type TOR2 and FKBP12 in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2A and Fig. 4), and this interaction was competed with excess FK506 (data not shown). Larger pieces of TOR2 failed to interact with FKBP12 or FKBP12-rapamycin in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2D). Introduction of TOR2 rapamycin resistance mutations (S1975I, S1975R, W2042L, W2042C, and F2049L) prevented FKBP12-rapamycin binding (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis confirmed that the wild-type and mutant GAL4-TOR2 fusion proteins were expressed to approximately equivalent extents (Fig. 3). Thus, these mutations act by blocking the TOR2-rapamycin-FKBP12 complex and do not, for example, destabilize the GAL4-TOR2 fusion protein. Because the W2042C, W2042L, and F2049L mutations confer only partial rapamycin resistance in vivo but do not bind FKBP12-rapamycin in the two-hybrid assay, other regions of TOR2, or other interacting proteins, likely participate in vivo.Figure 3:Wild-type and mutant GAL4-TOR2 and GAL4-FKBP12 fusion proteins are stably expressed. Panel A, GAL4(BD)-TOR wt and mutant fusion proteins were expressed in strain SMY4 and detected by Western blot with α-GAL4(BD) antiserum in highly concentrated, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated extracts. Due to the low steady state levels of the fusions, about 600 μg total protein were loaded per lane. Panel B, the same extracts as in panel A were detected using α-cyclophilin A antiserum as a control for protein loading. Panel C, extracts of strains expressing GAL4(AD)-FKBP12 fusions were detected by Western blot with α-FKBP12 antiserum. The extracts were prepared as in panel A. Panel D, extracts from panel C were detected with α-cyclophilin A as a control for protein loading. The portions of the gels shown represent molecular masses from 22 to 35 kDa (A), 7 to 24 kDa (B, D), and 25 to 50 kDa (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We created similar GAL4(BD)-TOR1 and GAL4(BD)-mTOR fusions and found that both TOR1 and mTOR bind to FKBP12-rapamycin (Fig. 2, B and C, and 4). Mutations at Ser-1972 of TOR1 and Ser-2035 of mTOR eliminated interaction. To examine the relative affinities of TOR proteins for FKBP12-rapamycin, two-hybrid reporter gene expression was measured with increasing concentrations of rapamycin in strains co-expressing the GAL4(AD)-FKBP12 and a GAL4(BD)-TOR fusion protein. Half-maximal binding of FKBP12-rapamycin to TOR1 occurred at ~10-fold lower rapamycin concentration compared to TOR2 and for mTOR was intermediate between TOR1 and TOR2 (Fig. 4). We determined if FKBP12 prolyl isomerase activity was required for FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TOR proteins. A mutation of human FKBP12, F36Y, is known to reduce prolyl isomerase activity 1000-fold but has no effect on FK506 binding or calcineurin inhibition(46Wiederrecht G. Hung S. Chan H.K. Marcy A. Martin M. Calaycay J. Boulton D. Sigal N. Kincaid R.L. Siekierka J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21753-21760Google Scholar). Yeast and human FKBP12 share 54% identity (47Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hiestand P.C. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1948-1952Google Scholar) and have superimposable tertiary structures(48Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. Science. 1991; 252: 839-842Google Scholar, 49Rotonda J. Burbaum J.J. Chan H.K. Marcy A.I. Becker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7607-7609Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of the corresponding mutation, F43Y, on yeast FKBP12-rapamycin-TOR interactions in the two-hybrid system. Western blot confirmed that the GAL4(AD)-FKBP12F43Y fusion protein was expressed, albeit at a somewhat lower level than wild-type GAL4-FKBP12 (Fig. 3C). Nonetheless, the GAL4(AD)-FKBP12F43Y mutant fusion protein interacted in a rapamycin-dependent fashion at nearly wild-type levels with all three TOR proteins (Fig. 5). Thus, FKBP12 prolyl isomerase activity is not required for rapamycin binding or association of the FKBP12-rapamycin complex with TOR1, TOR2, or mTOR. We assayed the contribution of FKBP12 surface residues to the formation of FKBP12-rapamycin-TOR complexes, focusing on residues adjacent to but distinct from the active site/ligand binding pocket (Asp-48, Arg-49, Phe-94). These studies were guided by the structure of the human FKBP12-rapamycin complex (50Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Google Scholar) and previous studies on the FKBP12-FK506-calcineurin complex(39Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Google Scholar, 51Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16029-16032Google Scholar, 52Rosen M.K. Yang D.

Western blot confirmed that the GAL4(AD)-FKBP12 mutant fusion proteins were expressed at levels comparable to the wild-type FKBP12 fusion protein (within ~2-fold; Fig. 3C). A hydrophobic substitution of an FKBP12 acidic surface residue, D48V, had only a minor 2-4-fold effect on FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TOR1 or TOR2 (Fig. 5, A and B). Substitution of two other surface residues, R49I and F94V, alone and in combination, had a more severe impact on binding of the mutant FKBP12-rapamycin complex to TOR1 and TOR2. There are, however, subtle differences between the TOR1 and TOR2 complexes with FKBP12-rapamycin (Fig. 5, A and B). For example, the F94V mutation impaired formation of the FKBP12-rapamycin-TOR2 complex, and this defect was more pronounced with the R49I,F94V double mutant. In contrast, the FKBP12-rapamycin-TOR1 complex was more sensitive to the R49I mutation, and the F94V mutation on its own had little or no effect on association with TOR1. Rapamycin-stimulated binding of GAL4(AD)-FKBP12 to GAL4(BD)-mTOR was less affected by these mutations (Fig. 5C), possibly as a result of the relatively stronger interaction (~7-fold; Fig. 2C) with FKBP12-rapamycin compared with TOR1 or TOR2. The GAL4(AD)-FKBP12 mutant fusion proteins were also expressed in an FKBP12 mutant strain and tested for functional complementation. The degree to which these fusion proteins complemented to restore rapamycin sensitivity in vivo (Fig. 6) correlated with ability to bind to GAL4(BD)-TOR2 fusion proteins (Fig. 5), indicating that binding to TOR2 is directly correlated with toxicity. Taken together, these findings reveal that a composite FKBP12-drug surface contacts the TOR proteins. Our finding that rapamycin stimulates the formation of complexes between FKBP12 and both the TOR1 and TOR2 proteins, taken together with other recent reports of FKBP12-rapamycin binding to mTOR(28Brown E.J.

Berlin V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12574-12578Google Scholar), to a TOR2 fragment(32Stan R. McLaughlin M.M. Cafferkey R. Johnson R.K. Rosenberg M. Livi G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32027-32030Google Scholar), or to intact TOR2 (27Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14 (in press)Google Scholar) confirms the original model, based on genetic evidence, that the TOR proteins are the direct targets of FKBP12-rapamycin(2Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. New Biol. 1992; 4: 448-460Google Scholar, 20Heitman J. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Science. 1991; 253: 905-909Google Scholar). Moreover, the finding that drug-resistant TOR mutants no longer bind to FKBP12-rapamycin further implicates FKBP12-rapamycin binding to the TOR proteins (especially to TOR2, which is essential) as the critical event in rapamycin toxicity. Our findings reveal that while FKBP12 prolyl isomerase activity is dispensable, FKBP12 surface residues are important for FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TOR1 and TOR2. FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TOR2 was more sensitive to perturbation by FKBP12 mutations compared with binding to TOR1, suggesting that although TOR1 and TOR2 are highly related, there are structural differences in the FKBP12-rapamycin-TOR interfaces. Notably, residues Arg-49 and Phe-94 of yeast FKBP12, and the corresponding residues Arg-42 and His-87 of human FKBP12, have been previously implicated in FKBP12-FK506 binding to calcineurin(39Cardenas M. Hemenway C. Muir R.S. Ye R. Fiorentino D. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5944-5957Google Scholar, 51Aldape R.A. Futer O. DeCenzo M.T. Jarrett B.P. Murcko M.A. Livingston D.J. J. Biol.

Soc. 1993; 115: 819-820Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that some of the same FKBP12 surface residues are important for the two distinct FKBP12-drug inhibitor complexes to interact with different targets, calcineurin, and the TOR proteins. The rapamycin-resistant TOR2 mutations and FKBP12 residues identified here are likely to be relevant for studies of FKBP12-rapamycin-TOR structures. The minimal FKBP12-rapamycin binding domain of TOR would be amenable for structural determination by either NMR or crystallography. Our studies define Trp-2042 and Phe-2049 as residues that, with Ser-1975, are likely to lie on the TOR interface with FKBP12-rapamycin. Similarly, FKBP12 residues Arg-49 and Phe-94 likely lie on the FKBP12-rapamycin interface with TOR2. These mutations should serve to guide analysis of FKBP12-rapamycin-TOR structures and models. There are several biological correlates to our analysis of FKBP12-rapamycin-TOR interactions in the two-hybrid system. The relative binding affinities of mutant FKBP12-rapamycin complexes to TOR2 (Fig. 5) were well correlated with functional complementation and restoration of rapamycin sensitivity in vivo (Fig. 6). Importantly, we found that FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TOR1 occurs at ~10-fold lower rapamycin concentrations compared to TOR2 (Fig. 4). We believe this comparison of relative binding affinity is valid based on the following findings. First, the same highly homologous domain from TOR1, TOR2, and mTOR was fused to GAL4. Second, by Western blot, the GAL4-TOR1 and GAL4-TOR2 fusion proteins were equivalently expressed (Fig. 3). Importantly, two biological observations also support the interpretation that TOR1 binds to FKBP12-rapamycin with higher affinity than TOR2. First, yeast strains lacking TOR1 are rapamycin hypersensitive, indicating that TOR1 normally effectively competes with TOR2 for FKBP12-rapamycin. Second, in yeast strains in which both TOR1 and TOR2 are required for viability, rapamycin sensitivity is increased 10-fold(27Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14 (in press)Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory reveal that while FKBP12-rapamycin binds TOR2, it does not inhibit the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity associated with TOR2(27Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14 (in press)Google Scholar). Importantly, the TOR1 and TOR2 domains that interact with FKBP12-rapamycin are distinct from and do not overlap the putative kinase domain. A data base search using the BLAST program of NCBI with the 1886-2081 region of TOR2 returns strong homology to only TOR1 and mTOR and very weak homology to another yeast protein, ESR1/MEC1(54Weinert T.A. Kiser G.L. Hartwell L.H. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 652-665Google Scholar, 55Kato R. Ogawa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3104-3112Google Scholar). Significantly, this region shows no similarity to any other phosphatidylinositol 3- or phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, indicating that it is outside the putative active site. FKBP12-rapamycin binding to TORs may inhibit interactions with other proteins that may, for example, be important for intracellular localization(27Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1995; 14 (in press)Google Scholar). We also found that yeast FKBP12-rapamycin binds mTOR, the mammalian homologue of the yeast TOR proteins, indicating that the FKBP12-TOR interaction surface is highly conserved from yeast to man. Mutation of the conserved serine residue in mTOR abolished binding by FKBP12-rapamycin. Further studies will be required to establish mTOR functions in rapamycin-sensitive signaling cascades in vivo. One approach would be to test if introduction of the mTOR mutant into T-lymphocytes confers rapamycin-resistant IL-2 signaling. Alternatively, mTOR might provide TOR1 or TOR2 function in yeast or render yeast rapamycin resistant when mutated. Such studies are in progress. We thank S. Muir for strains and plasmids, D.

We further noted that this kinase readily phosphorylates cPLA2 but not the S505A mutant of cPLA2. This observation indicated that the serine residing within the MAP kinase consensus sequence (i.e. Pro-Leu-Ser505-Pro) is the target phosphorylation site for the kinase. Significantly, the thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN also activated this proline-directed kinase but completely failed to stimulate ERK1/2. Nonetheless SFLLRN, like thrombin, mediated activation of cPLA2 by phosphorylation, and we reasoned that this unidentified kinase could play a role in the signal transduction pathways activated through the thrombin receptor. We therefore further characterized the kinase with the goal to determine its identity and define its role in the thrombin-induced signaling events during platelet activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlatelet Isolation and IncubationFresh human platelets were prepared from platelet-rich plasma of drug-free volunteers in the presence of prostacyclin (10-8M) and apyrase (0.5 units/ml) as described previously(2Kramer R.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26796-26804Google Scholar), suspended at 1.25 × 109/ml in 140 mM NaCl, 27 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2.2 mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, 0.2 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 30 μM cyclo(S,S)-Mpr(Har)-GDWP-Pen-NH2 (where Mpr is mercaptopropionyl, Har is homoarginine, and Pen is penicillamine) (3Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol.

Reactions were terminated by adding (final concentrations) 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM Na3VO4, 100 nM microcystin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 μM leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 μM pepstatin A, 1 mM Pefabloc (Centerchem), and 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5. The suspension was then briefly sonicated, centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g using a Sorvall RC M120EX microcentrifuge, and diluted with MonoQ buffer as indicated.Partial Purification of p38 and ERK Kinases by MonoQ ChromatographyHigh speed supernatants were subjected to chromatography on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min collecting 0.5-ml fractions using two different procedures. In order to partially purify the p38 kinase, the column was first equilibrated in buffer A (1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 100 μM Na3VO4, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl and subjected to a 30-ml linear salt gradient from 150 to 530 mM NaCl. For rapid partial purification of the p38 and the ERK kinases, the MonoQ column was equilibrated in buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl and then subjected to a step gradient from 50 to 250 mM NaCl (for elution of ERK1/2), followed by a step gradient from 250 to 450 mM NaCl (for elution of p38). MonoQ fractions (0.5 ml) were collected into 10 μl of a mixture providing (final concentrations) 100 nM microcystin, 100 μM leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM Pefabloc.Assay for Proline-directed KinasesKinase assays were performed as described before (1Kramer R.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14816-14823Google Scholar) using the Thr669 peptide substrate (KRELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR from Macromolecular Resources, Colorado State University) and the SpinZyme system (Pierce).SDS-PAGE and ImmunoblottingSamples were electrophoresed in 7.5% Tris/HCl gels (1 mm thick; Daiichi) or 10% Tris/glycine gels (1.5 mm thick; Novex) according to instructions of the manufacturer using Rainbow markers (range, 14.3-200 kDa; Amersham Corp.) as standards. Proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinyldifluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) using as blotting buffer 10 mM CAPS, pH 11.0, containing 0.01% SDS and 1% methanol. The membranes were incubated as follows: 1 h at room temperature in TBST (137 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% I-Block (Tropix)), followed by 1 h with primary antibody as indicated (see figure legends) in TBST and 30 min with secondary antibody (either goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L)/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (from Jackson ImmunoResearch and Bio-Rad, respectively)) in TBST. For immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies we used bovine serum albumin (0.75%) instead of I-Block. The blots were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn human platelets thrombin activates several kinases that readily phosphorylate the Thr669 peptide derived from the epidermal growth factor receptor(1Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Hyslop P.A. Utterback B.G. Hui K.Y. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14816-14823Google Scholar). Based upon the distinct chromatographic and immunological characteristics, these kinases could be distinguished and found to consist of the MAP kinases ERK1/2, as well as another unidentified proline-directed kinase. When extracts from control and thrombin-stimulated platelets were applied to MonoQ in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, ERK1/2 flowed through the column. The unknown thrombin-activated Thr669 kinase, on the other hand, bound tightly to the column and eluted at ≥350 mM NaCl (Fig. 1A). Consequently, the isoelectric point (IEP) of this kinase had to be significantly lower than that of ERK1/2 (~6.8). For example, the IEP of cPLA2 that binds similarly to MonoQ eluting with ~400 mM NaCl is 5.1(4Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Manetta J. Putnam J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5268-5272Google Scholar). Only three recently identified proline-directed kinases exhibit calculated IEPs in agreement with the observed chromatographic behavior of the platelet Thr669 kinase. These include JNK2 (p54α1)(5Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Ruble E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Google Scholar), p38 kinase(6Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar), and an ERK3 homolog (referred to as p97MAPK) (7Zhu A.X. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. Flier J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8202-8211Google Scholar) with IEPs of 5.7, 5.6, and 4.8, respectively.We therefore subjected extracts from thrombin-stimulated platelets and the most active Thr669 kinase MonoQ fractions 34 and 35 (see Fig. 1A) to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting, probing with antibodies against JNK2, p38, and ERK3. As shown in Fig. 2A anti-p38 antibodies specifically recognized a protein of ~40 kDa that was enriched in the MonoQ fractions (lane 2) compared with the loaded platelet extract (lane 1). The same ~40-kDa protein strongly reacted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (lane 4). Although ERK1 and ERK2 could be readily detected in extracts (lane 5), they were absent in the MonoQ fractions containing the Thr669 kinase activity (lane 6). As demonstrated in Fig. 2B, no immunoreactivity could be detected in extracts or active MonoQ fractions when probing with anti-JNK antibodies (lanes 8 and 9) or anti-ERK3 antibodies (lanes 11 and 12). By comparison both kinases could be readily seen when standard proteins were tested (lane 7 and lane 10). We confirmed the specificity of two anti-p38 antibodies (anti-p38N and anti-p38C) for the ~40-kDa protein by competition experiments with the respective C- and N-terminal peptides of p38 used for immunization. As demonstrated in Fig. 2C, the reactivity with the ~40-kDa protein was significantly decreased when the immunizing peptides were present during immunoblotting, including the anti-p38N (lane 14 versus lane 13) and the anti-p38C (lane 16 versus lane 15) antibodies. We further examined whether the kinase activity eluting from the MonoQ column (Fig. 1A) paralleled the immunoreactivity of the eluting kinase protein probing with both anti-p38 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B (upper right panel), the MonoQ elution of the ~40-kDa protein recognized by the anti-p38 antibodies correlated with the thrombin-induced Thr669 kinase activity. Likewise, coincident with the peak of kinase activity we detected thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the same ~40-kDa protein (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Taken together, these data indicate that the proline-directed kinase activated by thrombin is identical with, or closely related to, the p38 MAP kinase.Figure 2:Immunological identification of thrombin-stimulated Thr669 kinase. Soluble extracts (C) from thrombin-stimulated platelets (10 μl), MonoQ fractions containing the Thr669 kinase (K) (10 μl) (as in Fig. 1A), and standard proteins (St) were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting probing with different antibodies as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” A, anti-p38 (C-20) polyclonal antibody at 0.1 μg/ml (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) (lanes 1 and 2), anti-phosphotyrosine (αP-Y) monoclonal antibodies 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) plus PY20 (ICN) at 1 μg/ml each (lanes 3 and 4), and anti-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibody erk1-CT (Upstate Biotechnology) at 1 μg/ml (lanes 5 and 6). B, anti-JNK2 polyclonal antibody (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) at 0.1 μg/ml (lanes 7-9) and anti-ERK3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) at 1 μg/ml (lanes 10-12). The ability of anti-JNK2 and anti-ERK3 antibodies to recognize JNK2 and ERK3, respectively, was verified with purified human JNK2 (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) (lane 7) and human fibroblast ERK3 (Transduction Laboratories) (lane 10). C, anti-p38(N-20) antibodies (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) in the absence (lane 13) and presence of immunizing peptide N-20 (lane 14), and anti-p38 (C-20) antibody in the absence (lane 15) and presence of immunizing peptide C-20 (lane 16). Migration position of molecular mass marker is indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We determined the kinetics of thrombin-mediated activation of the p38 kinase, resolving it from ERK1/2 by MonoQ chromatography. As shown in Fig. 3A, thrombin induced a transient stimulation of p38 kinase activity that reached a maximum at 1 min and was still detected at the latest time point measured (5 min). The amount of p38 protein purified by MonoQ chromatography was the same for all time points examined, as verified by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). The appearance and disappearance of p38 kinase activity in thrombin-stimulated platelets temporally coincided with the tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 3C). By comparison, activation of the ERKs was delayed with maximal stimulation at 2 min following thrombin stimulation, as shown by the ability of ERK1/2 to phosphorylate the Thr669 peptide substrate (Fig. 4A) and the decreased electrophoretic mobility of the ERK proteins (Fig. 3C and Fig. 4B), indicative of activation(8Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 also reveal that activation by thrombin of p38 is more prominent than that of ERK1/2. A similar robust activation of p38 and delayed stimulation of ERK1/2 were observed in aspirinized platelets (where the synthesis of endogenous thromboxane A2 is inhibited), demonstrating that p38 kinase is the target of thrombin and not of the secondary agonist thromboxane A2 that is released from activated platelets.Figure 3:Time course of thrombin-mediated activation of p38 kinase. Platelets (0.6 ml at 1.25 × 109/ml) were incubated at 37°C in the absence (-THR) and presence of 5 units/ml of thrombin (+THR) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After addition of 150 μl of Triton X-100 stopping mixture and ultracentrifugation, the extracts were diluted with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 100 μM Na3VO4, and 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5 and subjected to MonoQ chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, determination of kinase activity in pooled MonoQ fractions containing the p38 kinase using 2 mM Thr669 peptide substrate as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” B, SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting verifying that equal amounts of p38 kinase protein were present in the pooled active MonoQ fractions derived from platelets incubated without thrombin (-THR) for 30 s to 5 min (lanes 1-4) and with thrombin (+THR) for 0-5 min (lanes 5-10). C, SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting of solubilized lysates (10 μl) from platelets incubated with thrombin (5 units/ml) for 0-5 min as indicated, probing for the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (αP-Y, lanes 1-5), p38 kinase (lanes 6-10), and ERK1/2 (lanes 11-14) using the antibodies as described in Fig. 2.

Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Google Scholar), and has only recently been identified in mammalian cells. Thus, Han et al.(10Han J. Lee J.-D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25009-25014Google Scholar) first described this novel kinase of apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa (therefore referred to as p38) in cells of monocytic lineage, observing that it is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to endotoxin. Cloning of the p38 kinase revealed that its predicted sequence is 52% identical to the yeast kinase HOG1 (6Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar) and shares with HOG1 the unique sequence TGY comprising the dual phosphorylation site typical of MAP kinases. Lee et al.(11Lee J.C. Layton J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher B.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar) identified the new kinase CSBP, a target of cytokine synthesis inhibitors, that was found to be identical with p38 kinase. Furthermore, Rouse et al.(12Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Google Scholar) discovered a stress-activated kinase recognized by antibodies against the Xenopus kinase Mpk2, a kinase closely related to HOG1 from yeast, and Freshney et al.(13Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Google Scholar) purified an interleukin-1-stimulated kinase from human epidermal carcinoma cells whose biochemical properties closely resembled those of the p38 kinase. Recent studies by Raingeaud et al.(14Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar) showed that p38 kinase is activated not only by osmotic stress and endotoxin but is also stimulated by inflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor, and exposure to UV radiation. In contrast, the p38 kinase was only poorly activated by growth factors, interferon-γ and phorbol ester(6Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar, 10Han J. Lee J.-D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25009-25014Google Scholar, 14Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar). Here, we report that the serine protease thrombin known to activate a heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor causes a marked activation of the p38 kinase. The stimulation of p38 kinase by thrombin not only precedes that of the ERKs but is also more pronounced than that of the ERKs. This suggests that p38, rather than the ERKs, may be involved in early proline-directed phosphorylation events during thrombin-mediated platelet activation. The difference in the temporal pattern of activation is consistent with the notion that the p38 and ERK MAP kinases are independently regulated by distinct signaling pathways (15Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar).The sequential kinase cascade leading to the activation of the ERK MAP kinases lies downstream of Ras and consists of two protein kinases (Raf and MAP kinase kinase) acting sequentially to activate the ERKs(15Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar). In contrast, the upstream regulatory mechanisms and protein kinases involved in the activation of p38 are not yet fully elucidated. Activation of p38 kinase requires dual phosphorylation on Thr180 and Tyr182(14Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar). Recently, a MAP kinase kinase referred to as JNKK (16Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.-X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Google Scholar) or MKK4 (17Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar) was identified that activates the p38 and also the JNK kinases. Another kinase, called MKK3, cloned as the human homolog of the yeast MAP kinase kinase PBS2, activated only the p38 kinase and not the ERK and JNK MAP kinases(17Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar). Thus, MKK3 may be a component of an independent signaling pathway that specifically activates the p38 kinase. Recently, the small GTP-binding proteins Rac1 and Cdc42 were shown to be efficient activators of the signaling cascade affecting the p38 kinase (18Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; : 1147-1157Google Scholar).Our studies show that the p38 kinase is present in human platelets, where it is transiently and potently stimulated by thrombin. Although the nature of the signaling pathways that participate in stimulation of platelets upon activation of the thrombin receptor has not been completely defined, it is known that the activated thrombin receptor couples to phosphatidylinositol biphosphate metabolism and inhibition of adenylate cyclase via the G proteins Gq and Gi, respectively(19Coughlin S.R. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 270-277Google Scholar). Receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins are thought to activate the ERK MAP kinase pathway via activated α and βγ G protein subunits(20Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 236-240Google Scholar). The thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN also stimulates the proline-directed kinase, now identified as p38, but, unlike thrombin, does not activate ERK1/2(1Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Hyslop P.A. Utterback B.G. Hui K.Y. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14816-14823Google Scholar). These findings suggest the existence of parallel pathways leading to the activation of either p38 or the ERKs. While both pathways can be stimulated by thrombin, SFLLRN activates solely the signaling pathway causing p38 stimulation. It thus appears that, at least in SFLLRN-stimulated platelets, the p38 kinase pathway is responsible for regulation of cPLA2. While other physiological functions of the p38 kinase remain to be elucidated, p38 is likely to be an integral part of a signaling pathway utilized by the thrombin receptor in platelets, and it will be of great interest to further investigate the role of p38 in platelet function.CONCLUSIONThrombin rapidly and potently stimulates the p38 kinase in human platelets, demonstrating that extracellular stimuli other than stress-related events and proinflammatory cytokines can activate this proline-directed kinase. Taken together with our previous findings (1Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Hyslop P.A. Utterback B.G. Hui K.Y. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14816-14823Google Scholar) these observations suggest that in platelets (i) thrombin activates two distinct signaling pathways that result in the activation of either the p38 or the ERK MAP kinases, (ii) the thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN exclusively signals through the p38 pathway, and (iii) cPLA2 appears to be one of the downstream targets of p38 kinase. INTRODUCTIONWe have recently shown that thrombin stimulates the activity of the MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAPmitogen-activated proteinERKextracellular signal-regulated kinasecPLA2cytosolic phospholipase A2JNKJun nuclear kinaseCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolIEPisoelectric pointPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. kinases ERK1 and ERK2 but also activates another proline-directed kinase that is distinguishable from ERK1/2 based on its strong binding to anion exchange resin and the lack of reactivity with anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (1Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Hyslop P.A. Utterback B.G. Hui K.Y. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14816-14823Google Scholar). We further noted that this kinase readily phosphorylates cPLA2 but not the S505A mutant of cPLA2. This observation indicated that the serine residing within the MAP kinase consensus sequence (i.e. Pro-Leu-Ser505-Pro) is the target phosphorylation site for the kinase. Significantly, the thrombin receptor agonist peptide SFLLRN also activated this proline-directed kinase but completely failed to stimulate ERK1/2. Nonetheless SFLLRN, like thrombin, mediated activation of cPLA2 by phosphorylation, and we reasoned that this unidentified kinase could play a role in the signal transduction pathways activated through the thrombin receptor. We therefore further characterized the kinase with the goal to determine its identity and define its role in the thrombin-induced signaling events during platelet activation."

This places the catalytic subunits of PKAIIα in proximity with potential target substrates in the cytoskeleton. The mechanism by which PKAIIα is anchored at the outer surface of germ cell mitochondria has not been elucidated. We now report the cloning of a cDNA that encodes a novel, germ cell A kinase anchor protein (AKAP) designated S-AKAP84. S-AKAP84 comprises 593 amino acids and contains a centrally located domain that avidly binds regulatory subunits (RIIα and RIIβ) of PKAIIα and PKAIIβ. The 3.2-kilobase S-AKAP84 mRNA and the cognate S-AKAP84 RII binding protein are expressed principally in the male germ cell lineage. Expression of S-AKAP84 is tightly regulated during development. The protein accumulates as spermatids undergo nuclear condensation and tail elongation. The timing of S-AKAP84 expression is correlated with the de novo accumulation of RIIα and RIIβ subunits and the migration of mitochondria from the cytoplasm (round spermatids) to the cytoskeleton (midpiece in elongating spermatids). Residues 1-30 at the NH2 terminus of S-AKAP84 constitute a putative signal/anchor sequence that may target the protein to the outer mitochondrial membrane.

RIα and its cognate mRNA are expressed in premeiotic and early postmeiotic germ cells(1Lonnerberg P. Parvinen M. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. Persson H. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 2Landmark B.F. Oyen O. Skalhegg B.S. Fauske B. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 99: 323-334Google Scholar). Moreover, the RIα polypeptide persists in elongating spermatids and mature sperm. In contrast, RIIβ mRNA and protein are initially expressed at a relatively late postmeiotic stage. As spermatocytes proceed through nuclear condensation and elongation the level of RIIβ polypeptide declines, and this isoform is not detected in mature sperm(1Lonnerberg P. Parvinen M. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. Persson H. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 2Landmark B.F. Oyen O. Skalhegg B.S. Fauske B. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 99: 323-334Google Scholar). RIIα expression is initiated in parallel with RIIβ accumulation. However, the level of RIIα polypeptide becomes maximal in late spermiogenesis, and the protein persists in mature, epididymal sperm(1Lonnerberg P. Parvinen M. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. Persson H. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 46: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 2Landmark B.F. Oyen O. Skalhegg B.S. Fauske B. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1993; 99: 323-334Google Scholar, 3Horowitz J.A. Toeg H. Orr G.A. J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2098-2104Google Scholar). protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase protein kinase A anchor protein kilobase(s). Activation of PKA in mature spermatozoa elicits the initiation and maintenance of flagellar movement(7Tash J.S. Means A.R. Biol. Reprod. 1982; 26: 745-763Google Scholar, 8Brokaw C.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 35: 175-184Google Scholar). This well established physiological response to cAMP is correlated with the cyclic nucleotide-stimulated sliding of a cytoskeletal structure (the fibrous sheath) over an internal microtubular structure called the axoneme(9Li Y. Okuno M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 208: 170-174Google Scholar). In mature spermatozoa PKAIα (RIα2C2) is evident in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane(3Horowitz J.A. Toeg H. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 832-838Google Scholar). In contrast, a high proportion of RIIα (and PKAIIα) is sequestered in the cytoskeleton. Thus, the C subunit of PKAIIα may catalyze selectively the phosphorylation of proximal regulatory and/or structural proteins in the cytoskeleton. These phosphoproteins may, in turn, mediate the dynamic reorganization of the flagellar cytoskeleton that is essential for motility and fertilization. Type IIα and type IIβ PKAs are often attached to the cytoskeleton or other organelles via the binding of RIIα or RIIβ with A kinase anchor proteins (AKAPs) (reviewed in (10Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479Google Scholar) and (11Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Google Scholar)). AKAPs, as typified by neuronal AKAPs 75, 79, and 150(12Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Google Scholar, 13Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Google Scholar, 14Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Google Scholar), are proteins that possess both a high affinity binding site for RIIβ/RIIα and an independent domain that targets and links RII-AKAP complexes to specific intracellular sites(15Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Google Scholar). This arrangement can place PKAIIα and/or PKAIIβ in proximity with organelle-bound substrates, thereby creating a target site for cAMP action(10Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479Google Scholar, 11Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Google Scholar, 12Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Google Scholar). RIIα (PKAIIα) accumulates at two sites in the sperm flagellum(16Lieberman S.J. Wasco W. MacLeod J. Satir P. Orr G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1809-1816Google Scholar). The bulk of the RIIα polypeptide is attached to the outer membrane of specialized “germ cell” mitochondria that form a helical array around the outer dense fibers and axoneme in the “midpiece” of the flagellum. A lesser fraction of RIIα is associated with the fibrous sheath in a distal portion (the “principal piece”) of the flagellum. Recently, Carrera et al.(17Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Google Scholar) cloned and sequenced cDNAs encoding a major fibrous sheath protein p82. p82 binds RIIα and contains two short segments that share sequence similarity with the targeting domains of neuronal AKAP75(15Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Google Scholar). It is likely that p82 mediates the binding of PKAIIα to the fibrous sheath. Major questions regarding the targeting of signals carried by cAMP in germ cells remain unanswered. How is the bulk of PKAIIα anchored on the outside surface of mitochondria? Does an AKAP mediate this localization? If so, is a previously characterized or a novel AKAP polypeptide used? Is the anchor protein developmentally regulated and targeted principally to mitochondria? We now describe the cloning and characterization of cDNAs that encode a unique germ cell anchor protein designated spermatid AKAP84 (S-AKAP84). S-AKAP84 contains an RII binding site and a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence. Moreover, S-AKAP84 accumulates as spermatids undergo nuclear condensation and flagellar elongation. The timing of expression of S-AKAP84 appears to be synchronized with the accumulation of RII subunits and the migration of mitochondria from the cytoplasm (round spermatids) to the cytoskeleton (midpiece in elongating spermatids). Immunofluorescence analysis documented directly that the RII binding protein is co-localized with the helical array of mitochondria in the midpiece of the flagellum. A human testis cDNA library in the expression vector λgt11 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was screened by the procedure of Bregman et al.(12Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Google Scholar, 13Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Google Scholar). This method detects AKAP-β-galactosidase fusion proteins in phage plaques by their ability to bind 32P-labeled RIIβ. Two recombinant phage clones (λT1 and λT2) that contained overlapping cDNA sequences were purified from a population of 5 × 105 plaques. A 5′ fragment of the larger (1.8-kilobase pair) cDNA (λT1) was employed as a template to synthesize random-primed, 32P-labeled cDNA for further screening (see “Results”). Eight independent cDNA clones (λT3-λT10) were obtained from a human testis 5′ stretch (oligo(dT)- and random-primed) cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt10 (Clontech) using procedures and conditions described in a previous publication(18Lu X. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Google Scholar). cDNA inserts from phage clones λT1-λT10 were cloned in the plasmid pGEM7Z (Promega) to generate the plasmid series pGT1-pGT10. DNA inserts were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure of Sanger et al.(19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) as described previously(18Lu X. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Google Scholar, 20Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Google Scholar). Sequencing reagents were obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Analyses of sequence data, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using PCGENE-IntelliGenetics software (IntelliGenetics, Mountainview, CA) and the BLAST program (21Altshcul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) provided by the NCBI server at the National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health. A DNA insert that encodes amino acids 193-357 in S-AKAP84 was amplified via the Taq DNA polymerase chain reaction(15Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Google Scholar). The 5′ primer (5′-CTGACATATGGGGGAGAGGGGAAGAGAGA-3′) contained an ATG codon in the context of an NdeI restriction site and 19 downstream nucleotides that match nucleotides 639-657 in the S-AKAP84 cDNA sequence. The 3′ primer (5′-ATCGGGATCCTCATCTGAGATCACTTGGGAGAT-3′) introduced a 3′ BamHI recognition site and a translation termination codon after nucleotide 1135. The last 20 nucleotides of the 3′ primer complement nucleotides 1116-1135 of S-AKAP84 cDNA (Fig. 1A). Amplified cDNA was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into the expression plasmid pET14b (Novagen), which was cleaved with the same restriction endonucleases. In recombinant pET14b, the partial S-AKAP84 cDNA is preceded by plasmid DNA that encodes an initiator ATG and 19 additional amino acids (including 6 consecutive His residues). Transcription of the chimeric gene is governed by a promoter sequence for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. The partial S-AKAP84 protein (designated P21 in accord with its calculated Mr of 21,000) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified to near homogeneity by metal-chelate affinity chromatography as described by Li and Rubin(22Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Google Scholar). A 500-ml culture of bacteria yielded 2 mg of P21. Anti-P21 serum was obtained as described previously (23Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Google Scholar). IgGs directed against S-AKAP84 were purified from 4 ml of serum by affinity chromatography on a 2-ml column of P21-Sepharose 6B (1.7 mg P21/ml resin) as described in Land et al.(23Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis was performed via the polymerase chain reaction as described for AKAP75 (15Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Google Scholar). The strategy described above for generating P21 illustrates the approach. Each 5′ primer (5′-CTGACATATGN21-3′) introduced an ATG codon in the context of an NdeI restriction site. This sequence preceded 21 nucleotides that encode the first 7 residues at the NH2 terminus of the truncated protein. Each 3′ primer (5′-ATCGGGATCCTCAN21-3′) contained a 3′ terminal BamHI site and created a stop codon after the desired COOH-terminal residue. The remaining 21 nucleotides in the 3′ primer complement the last 7 codons at the COOH terminus of the truncated protein. Mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into pET14b, and truncated proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as described by Li and Rubin (22Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Google Scholar). Table 1 gives the nomenclature for the truncated proteins and indicates the segment of S-AKAP84 that was expressed in bacteria. A mixture of pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and spermatids undergoing tail elongation and nuclear condensation (i.e. “condensing” spermatids) was obtained by sequentially incubating decapsulated adult mouse testes with collagenase and trypsin/DNase I, as described by Romrell et al.(24Romrell L.Y. Bellve A.R. Fawcett D.W. Dev. Biol. 1976; 49: 119-131Google Scholar) and Bellve et al.(25Bellve A.R. Millette C.F. Bhatnagar Y.M. O'Brien D.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 480-494Google Scholar). Purified populations of each cell type were isolated by sedimenting the cell mixture (at unit gravity) through a 2-4% (w/v) gradient of albumin in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium(17Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Google Scholar). Spermatozoa were obtained from the cauda epididymides. Cytosolic and particulate fractions of mouse testis were prepared as described previously(13Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Google Scholar). Samples of cells, cell fractions, or purified proteins were denatured in gel loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS as described previously(12Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Google Scholar). Western blots were prepared by transferring the size-fractionated polypeptides and molecular weight standards to an Immobilon P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore Corp.), as described in Bregman et al.(12Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with 0.3 nM32P-labeled RIIβ (2 × 105 cpm 32P radioactivity/ml), and RIIβ binding proteins were visualized by autoradiography as indicated in several papers(12Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Google Scholar, 13Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Google Scholar, 15Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Google Scholar). Results were quantified by scanning and integrating with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) coupled to a computer running ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Western blots of proteins from fractionated germ cells and testis were blocked, incubated with antiserum (1:1000) or affinity-purified anti-S-AKAP84 IgGs (1:1000 relative to serum), and washed as described previously(15Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Google Scholar, 26Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 267: 2131-2134Google Scholar). S-AKAP84 and partial S-AKAP84 polypeptides were visualized by indirect chemiluminescence using an ECL kit from Amersham Corp. as previously reported(26Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 267: 2131-2134Google Scholar, 27Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Google Scholar). Relative amounts of antigen were determined by scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics) of chemiluminescence signals on x-ray film. Standard curves were prepared with 0.5-100 ng of purified S-AKAP84. Amounts of S-AKAP84 protein in experimental samples were obtained from the linear portion of the standard curve. Total RNA was isolated from purified germ cells and mouse testis as described by Carrera et al.(17Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Google Scholar). RNAs were fractionated by electrophoresis in a denaturing agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 32P-labeled cDNA (106 cpm/ml), corresponding to nucleotides 762-1260 in the S-AKAP84 sequence (Fig. 1A) as described previously(17Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Google Scholar). Signals were visualized by autoradiography. A multiple-tissue RNA blot containing size-fractionated human poly(A+) RNAs (2 μg/lane) was obtained from Clontech. The blot was probed with the 32P-labeled cDNA described above. Hybridization, washing, and autoradiography were performed as described previously(28Sul H.S. Wise L.S. Brown M.L. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1201-1205Google Scholar). A mixed germ cell population was prepared by mincing testis with a razor blade and then gently pipetting to release cells from the seminiferous tubules. Germ cells were fixed and permeabilized as described by Carrera et al.(17Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Google Scholar). The specimens then were incubated sequentially with affinity-purified anti-S-AKAP84 IgGs (1:100 relative to serum) and fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:100). As a control for specificity of binding, the antibody (1:100) was preabsorbed with P21 fusion protein (2 μg) for 2 h at room temperature prior to its incubation with the germ cells. The intracellular localization of the anchor protein was observed in a Zeiss Photomicroscope III equipped with epifluorescence and was photographed with Kodak T-Max P3200 film. A human testis cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt11 was screened for the expression of β-galactosidase fusion proteins that bind 32P-labeled RIIβ with high affinity. Two positive recombinant phage clones (λT1 and λT2) were purified to homogeneity. The cDNA inserts from λT1 and λT2 were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM7Z and sequenced. The larger λT1 cDNA insert included the cDNA sequence from λT2 and began with an open reading frame for 401 amino acids. The coding region was followed by a translation termination signal and >500 base pairs of 3′ untranslated sequence. These observations and the absence of a consensus initiator ATG indicated that the cDNAs were incomplete and lacked upstream coding and 5′-untranslated sequences. Subsequently, a 499-base pair ApaI fragment, corresponding to nucleotides 123-621 at the 5′ end of the λT1 cDNA, was used to generate 32P-labeled cDNA for further screening. A human testis cDNA library enriched in 5′ sequences yielded eight cDNA clones that were analyzed by sequencing. The cDNA designated pGT7 contained novel 5′-coding and 5′-untranslated sequences linked to the complete downstream coding and untranslated sequences determined for λT1 cDNA. The remaining phage clones contained overlapping partial cDNA sequences that were identical to portions of the cDNAs in pGT7 and λT1. The net result from multiple rounds of analysis is that each segment of the testis AKAP cDNA was sequenced from both strands in at least three independent cDNA clones. The data are presented in Fig. 1A. An open reading frame of 1779 base pairs begins at an initiator ATG (nucleotides 63-65) that lies within a consensus translation start site(29Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar). Although the exact size of the 5′-untranslated region is unknown, the occurrence of an in-frame translation stop codon at nucleotides 42-44 precludes the possible utilization of a distal, upstream initiator ATG. The AKAP open reading frame terminates with a stop codon at nucleotides 1842-1844 (Fig. 1A). The sequence of >500 base pairs of 3′-untranslated sequence was determined, but neither a poly(A) tail nor a polyadenylation signal was evident. Since a 3.2-kb mRNA hybridized with the newly cloned cDNA (see Fig. 4), it is possible that the total length of the 3′-untranslated region exceeds 1.2 kb. However, the length and complete sequence of the 5′-untranslated region also remain to be determined. The protein encoded by the cDNA sequence shown in Fig. 1A is named spermatid-A kinase anchor protein 84 or S-AKAP84 because it (a) binds RIIβ and RIIα, (b) exhibits an apparent Mr of 84,000 upon electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and (c) is expressed in male germ cells. Experiments documenting these properties are presented below. The open reading frame in Fig. 1A reveals that S-AKAP84 comprises 593 amino acids and has a calculated Mr of 62,912. The amino acid composition of S-AKAP84 is atypical; the protein is enriched in Glu, Pro, and Ser, which account for 31% of the residues in the predicted sequence. The abundance of Glu residues is reflected in the predicted isoelectric point (pI = 4.55) and net charge(-36) of the polypeptide at pH 7.4. The sequence of S-AKAP84 is not homologous with protein sequences compiled in the SWISS-PROT, GenBank™, and PIR data bases. However, the novel protein includes two short motifs that may correspond to functional domains. Four tandem repeats of the heptapeptide consensus sequence DRNEEGL are evident between amino acid residues 310 and 338 (Fig. 1A). The beginning and end of the reiterated region are closely bordered by the tripeptide NEE (residues 306-308 and 341-343), which corresponds to the central core of the consensus heptapeptide. The occurrence of a Leu residue at the seventh position in each repeated unit raises the possibility that this segment of S-AKAP84 constitutes a coiled-coil or leucine zipper region(30Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar). Leucine zipper regions often mediate the homo- and/or hetero-oligomerization of protein subunits. An important caveat is that the heptapeptide repeats of S-AKAP84 lack an internal hydrophobic residue that is conserved in prototypical leucine zipper domains(30Landschultz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar, 31O'Shea E. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Aber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Google Scholar). A lengthy hydrophobic region (amino acid residues 8-26, Fig. 1A) is evident near the NH2 terminus of S-AKAP84. The hydrophobic domain and contiguous NH2- and COOH-terminal flanking sequences were compared with classical “signal sequences” via computer programs (32von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Google Scholar, 33Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Google Scholar). The results suggest that this portion of S-AKAP84 does not constitute a classical signal sequence capable of targeting the protein to a secretory pathway or the plasma membrane. Instead, aspects of the organization and properties of the NH2 terminus of S-AKAP84 match more closely with features described for the NH2-terminal segment of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase(34Beasley E.M. Muller S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2303-2311Google Scholar, 35Hahne K. Haucke V. Ramage L. Schatz G. Cell. 1994; 79: 829-839Google Scholar). The key shared properties in S-AKAP84 are as follows: (a) the first 7 residues include basic and hydroxylated amino acids (Arg6, Ser7); (b) a long, extremely hydrophobic segment (19 residues) provides a contiguous stop-transfer/hydrophobic anchor domain; (c) positively charged downstream residues (Arg28, Lys29, Lys30, His32; Fig. 1A) complete and stabilize the stop transfer signal; and (d) acidic residues are excluded from the NH2 terminus and first appear ~10 residues downstream from the end of the hydrophobic segment. Similar features target the NH2 terminus of NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase to the outer membrane of mitochondria(35Hahne K. Haucke V. Ramage L. Schatz G. Cell. 1994; 79: 829-839Google Scholar). The stable, post-translational insertion of the anchor sequence in the outer membrane tethers this enzyme at a physiologically relevant location and simultaneously ensures that its catalytic domain is exposed in the cytoplasm. Locations and sequences of potentially important structural motifs in the S-AKAP84 polypeptide are shown in Fig. 1B. P21, a fusion protein antigen that contains amino acids 193-357 of S-AKAP84 (see “Experimental Procedures”), was injected into rabbits to obtain antiserum. IgGs directed against S-AKAP84 were isolated by affinity chromatography on P21-Sepharose 6B. The purified IgGs avidly bound both P21 (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and an 84-kDa protein from mouse testis (Fig. 2B, lane 1). The antibodies also produced weak signals with a 120-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 7B, and see below) and two smaller proteins (Fig. 2B, lane 1 and Fig. 7B). The latter proteins were observed only occasionally and appear to be proteolytic fragments of the 84-kDa anchor protein. Binding of anti-S-AKAP84 IgGs to target antigens was inhibited when antibodies were preincubated with excess recombinant P21 (Fig. 2A, lane 2 and Fig. 2B, lane 2). Anti-S-AKAP84 IgGs produced a detectable chemiluminescence signal with as little as 0.1 ng of purified recombinant P21 (data not shown). Thus, the antibodies are selective and sensitive. A combination of deletion mutagenesis and expression of partial S-AKAP84 polypeptides in E. coli was used to map the RII binding region. The ability of wild type and truncated S-AKAP-84 proteins to bind 32P-labeled RIIβ was monitored by an “overlay binding assay”(13Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Google Scholar, 15Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Google Scholar, 22Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Google Scholar). (S-AKAP84 also binds RIIα avidly, 2R. Y. Lin and C. S. Rubin, unpublished observations. but studies described in this paper were performed with RIIβ. RI subunits are not bound by S-AKAP84).2 Amounts of full-length and partial AKAP polypeptides synthesized were independently assessed by Western immunoblot analysis. Partial S-AKAP84 proteins were generated by NH2- and/or COOH-terminal truncation as indicated in Table 1. Signals indicating expression levels and RIIβ binding activities for a representative subset of mutant proteins are shown in Fig. 3.

In this situation, genes normally expressed in the fetal ventricular cardiomyocyte (e.g. atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), and skeletal muscle (SkM) α-actin) are re-expressed, and there is transient expression of immediate early genes (e.g. c-fos). Using appropriate reporter plasmids, we studied the effects of transfection of the constitutively active or dominant negative mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MEK1 on ANF, β-MHC, and SkM α-actin promoter activities in cultured ventricular cardiomyocytes. ANF expression was stimulated (maximally 75-fold) by the hypertrophic agonist phenylephrine in a dose-dependent manner (EC50, 10 μM), and this stimulation was inhibited by dominant negative MEK1. Cotransfection of dominant negative MEK1 with a dominant negative mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK2)) increased this inhibition. Transfection with constitutively active MEK1 constructs doubled ANF promoter activity. The additional cotransfection of wild-type ERK2 stimulated ANF promoter activity by about 5-fold. Expression of β-MHC and SkM α-actin was also stimulated. Promoter activity regulated by activator protein-1 or c-fos serum response element consensus sequences was also increased. We conclude that the MEK1/ERK2 cascade may play a role in regulating gene expression during hypertrophy.

In adult mammals, the ventricular cardiomyocyte is a terminally differentiated cell that loses its ability to mitose soon after birth. However, in response to the imposition of an increased workload in vivo, it adapts hypertrophically to accommodate the increased contractile load (reviewed in (21Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar)). This process contributes substantially to the clinical entity of “cardiac hypertrophy.” In both the in vivo setting and primary cultures of ventricular myocytes from neonatal rat hearts, a number of characteristic transcriptional modifications distinguish the hypertrophy from normal maturational growth (reviewed in (21Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar)). Following a hypertrophic stimulus, immediate early gene (e.g. c-fos, c-jun, egr-1) expression is rapidly and transiently up-regulated. Following this, genes that are only normally expressed in the fetal ventricle are re-expressed (e.g. atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), and skeletal muscle α-actin (SkM α-actin)). In the slightly longer term, expression of constitutive contractile protein genes (e.g. ventricular myosin light chain-2, cardiac muscle α-actin) is increased. Stimulation of promoter activity for these genes has frequently been used as a marker of the hypertrophic response (reviewed in (21Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar)). The precise physiological stimuli that induce cardiac hypertrophy in vivo have not been identified, and the cause may be multifactorial. In cultured myocytes, a number of interventions lead to the acquisition of the hypertrophic phenotype. These include sympathoadrenal agonists (especially α1-adrenergic agonists(22Simpson P. Circ.

Here, we show directly that specific activation of the ERK cascade using transfected expression plasmids encoding constitutively active MEK mutants leads to stimulation of a variety of promoters of genes known to be up-regulated during the hypertrophic response. Sprague-Dawley rats were bred within the National Heart and Lung Institute. Cell culture reagents and other reagents were from Sigma, Life Technologies, or Merck. Details of MEK1 and ERK2 expression plasmids and of firefly luciferase (LUX) reporter plasmids are given inTABLE I, TABLE II, respectively. Human wild-type (wt) MEK1 and MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) were gifts from Dr. N. G. Ahn (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Dept. of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO) and Dr. S.

Chien), in which β-galactosidase expression is controlled by a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter, was cotransfected to control for transfection efficiency. Myocytes were isolated and cultured by a method based on that of Iwaki et al.(24Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were dissociated from the ventricles of 1-2-day-old rat hearts using 0.4 mg/ml collagenase and 0.6 mg/ml pancreatin in 116 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, 0.8 mM Na2HPO4, 5.6 mM glucose, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO4 (pH 7.35). The cells were resuspended in maintenance medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 (4:1 (v/v)) containing 100 units/ml of both penicillin and streptomycin) supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were preplated for 30 min on uncoated 60-mm culture dishes (Primaria, Falcon) to deplete fibroblasts, and then the myocytes were plated at a final density of 350 cells/mm2 on 60-mm gelatin-precoated dishes. After 20 h, the medium was changed to maintenance medium (4 ml) containing 4% horse serum. Myocytes were transfected 24 h after the initial plating by a calcium phosphate precipitation method. Plasmids were diluted in 0.25 M CaCl2, and an equal volume of 50 mM Bes (pH 6.9), 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4 was added. After 20 min, cells were transfected with this suspension (1 ml/plate). Myocytes were standardly transfected with 15 μg of LUX reporter plasmid, 4 μg of pON249, and a total of 10 μg of test plasmid(s). In control experiments, test plasmids were replaced by empty vectors. Controls were carried out concurrently for each transfection. In experiments where the dependence of ANF-LUX expression on phenylephrine concentration was studied, test plasmids were omitted. After transfection for 16-20 h, cells were washed in maintenance medium containing 10% horse serum and then twice with maintenance medium. Cells were incubated for 48 h in maintenance medium, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted on ice with 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.9), 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol (0.4 ml) for 15 min. LUX activity was assayed in 0.5 ml of 100 mM Tricine (pH 7.8), 10 mM MgSO4, 2 mM EDTA, 75 μM luciferin, and 5.5 mM ATP. Light emitted was measured using an LKB 1219 RackBeta liquid scintillation counter with the photomultipliers set out of coincidence. For assessment of transfection efficiency and cell area, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and stained with 0.2 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 2 mM MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline. The number of blue cells in 100 fields was counted for each treatment. Cell area of transfected (blue) cells was estimated using an image grabber and planimetry. Statistical significance was assessed as appropriate by a two-tailed paired or unpaired Student's t test with a significant difference taken as being established at p < 0.05. Transfection efficiency, determined by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside staining, was 2%. For a given experiment, the number of blue cells per 100 fields did not change significantly with any treatment. Promoter activities have not therefore been corrected for β-galactosidase activity and are presented in terms of light emitted relative to a vector control. After exposure to 0.1 mM phenylephrine for 48 h, the area of the cardiomyocytes transfected with pON249 was 1433 ± 122 μm2versus 987 ± 123 μm2 for similarly transfected control cells cultured in serum-free medium (mean ± S.E., n = nine randomly selected cells for each condition, p < 0.025 by an unpaired two-tailed t test). In the following experiments, the areas of 50 randomly selected transfected cells were measured. Details of expression plasmids are given inTable 1. Transfection of cardiomyocytes with MEK1(E217/E221) + ERK2(wt) (5 μg of each) in addition to pON249 did not significantly increase cell area (1087 ± 107 μm2versus 872 ± 59 μm2 for cells transfected with 10 μg of vector, mean ± S.E., p = 0.078 by an unpaired two-tailed t test). In an analogous experiment, MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) replaced MEK1(E217/E221). Again, there was no significant increase in cell area (MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) + ERK2(wt), 1147 ± 55 μm2; vector control, 977 ± 64 μm2; mean ± S.E., p = 0.068 by an unpaired two-tailed t test).TABLE I Open table in a new tab We confirmed earlier observations by others (25Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine stimulated ANF promoter activity (Fig. 1). Stimulation was readily detectable even at low (<0.5 μM) concentrations of phenylephrine, with light emitted being typically 1 million to 2 million counts/4 s at maximally effective concentrations of agonist. Stimulation was maximally about 75-fold and was half-maximal at about 10 μM phenylephrine (Fig. 1). The latter agrees well with the KD for the binding of phenylephrine to the ventricular α1-adrenoreceptor (about 5 μM in our hands(49Lazou A. Fuller S.J. Bogoyevitch M.A. Orfali K.A. Sugden P.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H970-H978PubMed Google Scholar)). No stimulation of LUX activity by 0.1 mM phenylephrine was detected using a reporter plasmid that lacked the ANF promoter sequence. Details of expression plasmids and LUX reporter constructs are given inTABLE I, TABLE II, respectively. ANF promoter activity was not stimulated significantly by transfection with ERK2(wt) or with MEK1(wt) alone but was stimulated about 2-fold by transfection with a combination of these plasmids (Fig. 2). Transfection with MEK1(E221) or MEK1(E217/E221) also doubled ANF promoter activity, but only the result with MEK1(E221) was statistically significant (Fig. 2). The greatest stimulation (4.5-5-fold) of ANF promoter activity was observed when MEK1(E221) or MEK1(E217/E221) was cotransfected with ERK2(wt) (Fig. 2). This stimulation was significantly greater than in transfections with MEK1(wt) + ERK2(wt) (Fig. 2). Activation of other promoters (seeTable 2) up-regulated during the hypertrophic response was also examined (Fig. 3). Under optimal conditions for ANF promoter stimulation (i.e. transfection with ERK2(wt) + MEK1(E217/E221)), the β-MHC promoter activity was stimulated 15-fold, c-fos SRE activity was stimulated 10-fold, and SkM α-actin activity was stimulated 5-fold. Despite the higher constitutive specific activity of human MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) over rabbit MEK1(E217/E221), transfection of cardiomyocytes with ERK2(wt) + MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) did not significantly increase the activities of the ANF, β-MHC, and SkM α-actin promoters or of the c-fos SRE over ERK2(wt) + MEK1(E217/E221) (results not shown). However, the reasons for this could have been trivial (e.g. from differences in levels of expression of MEK1). Levels of expression of the constructs (even epitope-tagged constructs) cannot be easily assessed in cultured cardiomyocytes because of the low transfection efficiency.TABLE II Open table in a new tab The sensitivity of TRE/AP-1 sites in the TRE2PRL(-36) construct to activation by MEK1 was also examined. Cotransfection of MEK1(E217/E221) with ERK2(wt) stimulated LUX activity significantly by 24.0 ± 7.3-fold (mean ± S.E.), whereas cotransfection of rabbit MEK1(wt) and ERK2(wt) resulted in a statistically insignificant 3.0 ± 1.0-fold (mean ± S.E.) increase (Fig. 3). Human MEK1(wt) + ERK2(wt) also increased LUX activity 5.0 ± 1.4-fold (mean ± S.E., n = five separate preparations of cardiomyocytes). MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) + ERK2(wt) increased LUX activity by 682 ± 205-fold (mean ± S.E., n = five separate preparations of cardiomyocytes, p < 0.02 by an unpaired two-tailed t test versus MEK1(E217/E221) + ERK2(wt)). Activation by the wild-type MEK1 constructs alone in pEXV3 or pCEP4L did not differ. The AP-1-regulated promoter was the only one that showed significantly greater activation with the human MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) expression plasmid than with the rabbit MEK1(E217/E221) construct. No stimulation of LUX activity by MEK1(E217/E221) + ERK2(wt) was detected with the promoterless vectors for ANF or TRE/AP-1 (results not shown). MEK1(A221) acts in a dominant negative manner in NIH 3T3 cells to block stimulation of DNA synthesis by serum(19Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were transfected with 5 μg of MEK1(wt) or MEK1(A221) (plus the ANF reporter plasmid and pON249). With MEK1(A221), ANF promoter activity in the presence of the EC50 concentration of phenylephrine (10 μM) was 70 ± 1% of that in the presence of MEK1(wt) (mean ± S.E., n = five separate preparations of cardiomyocytes, p < 0.001 by a paired two-tailed t test). When cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of MEK1(A221) in conjunction with 5 μg of dominant negative ERK2(A52/A183/F185) (50Leevers, S. J., 1993, Activation of the MAP Kinase Pathway by p21 Ras. Ph.D. Thesis, University of London.Google Scholar), ANF promoter activity decreased to 54 ± 6% of that in the presence of ERK2(wt) + MEK1(wt) (mean ± S.E., n = five separate preparations of cardiomyocytes, p < 0.001 by a paired two-tailed t test). One pathway that stimulates promoter activities of genes induced during hypertrophy involves the binding of agonists to Gq-coupled receptors, thereby stimulating phospholipase Cβ-mediated hydrolysis of membrane phosphatidylinositols(30Shubeita H.E.

Xu S. Ebert D. Cobb M.H. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 63: 93-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 7). We have proposed that activation of MEK and ERK is an important aspect of the hypertrophic response(42Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar,44Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Andersson M.B. Clerk A. Lazou A. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1110-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of rabbit MEK1 involves phosphorylation of Ser217 and/or Ser221 in a LIDS217MANS221 sequence (14Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser221 →Glu or double mutation of Ser217 and Ser221 →Glu produces MEK1 species, which are 30-40-fold more active than the unphosphorylated enzyme(14Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). However, in vitro, these mutated species express only about 0.5% of the activity of recombinant wild-type MEK1 that had been phosphorylated by c-Raf(14Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Despite this relatively low level of activity, recombinant MEK1(E217/E221) is able to phosphorylate and activate recombinant ERK2 fully in vitro.( (2)P. H. Sugden, unpublished observations.) By combining mutation of the analogous Ser residues in human MEK1 (Ser218 → Glu and Ser222 → Asp) with deletion of an N-terminal 20-amino acid predicted α-helix, Mansour et al.(18Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) produced a MEK1 that was 400 times more active than the unphosphorylated wild-type MEK1. As discussed in (19Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar), the apparent discrepancy between the low level of constitutive activity of recombinant MEK1(E217/E221) and the ability of transfected MEK1(E217/E221) to activate ERK can be rationalized as follows. First, a small activation of MEK may be sufficient to activate ERK fully(64Saito Y. Gomez N. Campbell D.G. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, following exposure of cells to suitable agonists, endogenous MEK activity is stimulated but rapidly returns to basal values(47Bogoyevitch M.A. Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), presumably because of protein phosphatase activity. MEK1(E217/E221) is not subject to such regulation. To examine whether MEK (and hence its sole substrate, ERK(11Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4220-4227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) plays any role in the regulation of expression of hypertrophic marker genes, we transfected cardiomyocytes with plasmids encoding constitutively active MEK1. Transfection with MEK1(E221) stimulated ANF promoter activity by about 2-fold, and MEK1(E217/E221) showed the same trend (Fig. 2). Stimulation was increased to approximately 5-fold when ERK2(wt) was additionally cotransfected (Fig. 2). Thus, ERK may be limiting in the cardiomyocyte. Under optimal conditions (ERK2(wt) and MEK1(E217/E221) cotransfected), activities of promoters for β-MHC and SkM α-actin and the c-fos SRE were stimulated by up to 15-fold (Fig. 3). Cotransfection of MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) (18Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar) with ERK2(wt) did not increase promoter activation further (results not shown). The stimulation of ANF promoter activity by MEK1(E221) or MEK1(E217/E221), even with cotransfection of ERK2(wt) (Fig. 2), was much less than the 75-fold stimulation seen with maximally effective concentrations of phenylephrine (Fig. 1). In contrast, the agonist-stimulated and the MEK1(E217/E221)-stimulated responses were similar in magnitude in the PC12 cell line(19Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). The relatively low constitutive activities of MEK1(E221) and MEK1(E217/E221) may be more important in the primary cultures of cardiomyocytes than in established cell lines(19Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). The time courses of protein expression from the constructs may differ between cell types. Alternatively, the MEK/ERK cascade may not be of prime importance in the regulation of ANF promoter activity and, by implication, development of the hypertrophic phenotype. However, the stimulation of ANF promoter activity by phenylephrine is decreased by transfection with a plasmid encoding dominant negative MEK1(A221) and inhibition is increased by cotransfecting additionally with dominant negative ERK2(A52/A183/F185). Thorburn et al. have also recently shown that transfection of dominant negative ERK1 (as well as chemical inhibition of ERK) blocked activation of the ANF, MLC-2 and c-fos promoters by phenylephrine(45Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanisms involved in the activation of promoters for hypertrophic marker genes are unclear. For the ANF gene, the region principally responsible for phenylephrine-inducible expression (base pairs -323 to -638) contains TRE/AP-1, AP-2, CRE, Egr-1 and SRE/CArG consensus sequences(25Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection of MEK1(E217/E221) or MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) with ERK2(wt) stimulates at TRE/AP-1-regulated expression by 24- or 680-fold, respectively. This is the only example we found of MEK1(E217/E221) and MEK1(ΔN3.E218/D222) differing significantly. Activation at TRE/AP-1 sites involves the binding of heterodimers of members of the Fos and Jun families (AP-1 complexes), transactivation being stimulated by the phosphorylation of Jun (reviewed in (65Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar)). Although ERK can phosphorylate the N-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun(66Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar), a separate Jun N-terminal kinase (also known as stress-activated protein kinase) family has been identified (reviewed in (67Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) and (68Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar)). However, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases are not activated by MEK1(69Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Furthermore,Fig. 3 shows that MEK1 + ERK2 is capable of activation at AP-1 sites, presumably by phosphorylation of the AP-1 complex. An alternative pathway for activation of the ANF and SkM α-actin promoters is through their SRE/CArG sequences(25Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,70Brand T. MacLellan W.R. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11500-11503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence is present in the native c-fos promoter (reviewed in (71Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar)) and in the c-fos construct used here. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk-1 (p62-TCF) by ERK increases its transactivating activity at SRE/CArG(72Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other transcription factors (e.g. Egr-1, expression of which is coregulated with c-fos(73Sukhatme V.P. Cao X. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C.P. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B. Curran T. Le Beau M.M. Adamson E.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar)) may be involved in the mediation of the hypertrophic response(24Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,25Knowlton K.U. Baracchini E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Henderson S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

Our overall conclusions are that activation of the MEK/ERK cascade can stimulate ANF-, β-MHC-, c-fos SRE-, SkM α-actin-, and TRE/AP-1-regulated promoter activity. This may be of relevance to the development of the hypertrophic phenotype in the ventricular cardiomyocyte. We thank Professor C. J. Marshall for helpful discussion."

For example, pulmonary arterial EC normally reside in a pO2 of 35-40 mm Hg and may be exposed to lower oxygen concentrations in disease states. Yet, we and others have shown that bovine and human EC in culture are extremely tolerant to decreases in ambient oxygen tension(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin.

For instance, although exposure to 0% oxygen for 4-5 days is lethal to bovine pulmonary artery and aortic EC (BPAEC and BAEC, respectively) not acclimatized to hypoxia, BPAEC and BAEC grown in 3% oxygen and then exposed to 0% oxygen survive, proliferate, and maintain characteristic EC appearance for more than 6 days. 2K.

In studying the EC response to hypoxia, we have previously described the hypoxia associated proteins (HAPs), a unique set of five cell-associated stress proteins (Mr 34, 36, 39, 47, and 57) up-regulated in a time and oxygen concentration-dependent manner in EC exposed to hypoxia (1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 2Graven K.K. Zimmerman L.H. Dickson E.W. Weinhouse G.L. Farber H.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 544-555Google Scholar, 3Graven K.K. Troxler R.F. Kornfeld H. Panchenko M.V. Farber H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24446-24452Google Scholar). The hypoxic up-regulation of HAPs in EC occurs in lieu of the stereotypic hypoxic induction of heat-shock and glucose-regulated proteins seen in more hypoxia-sensitive cells and correlates with the ability of EC to tolerate hypoxia. As part of our efforts to elucidate the function of the HAPs in physiologic and hypoxic conditions, we have previously identified the 36-kDa HAP as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(3Graven K.K. Troxler R.F. Kornfeld H. Panchenko M.V. Farber H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24446-24452Google Scholar). In the current study, we report the isolation and identification of HAP47 as non-neuronal enolase (NNE) and examine its hypoxic regulation. Bovine serum albumin was obtained from Hyclone Corp (Logan, CT). All other tissue culture materials were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Oxygen gas mixtures were purchased from Wesco (Billerica, MA). Protein quantification was performed spectrophotometrically with a kit from Bio-Rad. A rabbit derived polyclonal antibody directed against the α-subunit of NNE with cross-reactivity against the γ-subunit of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was obtained from Biogenesis (Franklin, MN). A murine monoclonal antibody raised against human NSE and specific for the enolase γ-subunit was obtained from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). Secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Technology (Santa Cruz, CA). Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent was obtained from DuPont NEN. TriReagent-LS was obtained from Molecular Research Center (Cincinnati, OH), random primer labeling was performed using a kit from Promega (Madison, WI), and QuikHyb was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), nitrocellulose membranes (0.2-μm pore size) were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell, and nylon membranes (Hybond-N+) were purchased from Amersham Corp. Bovine EC were isolated from freshly excised calf pulmonary arteries and aortas as described previously(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 2Graven K.K. Zimmerman L.H. Dickson E.W. Weinhouse G.L. Farber H.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 544-555Google Scholar, 3Graven K.K. Troxler R.F. Kornfeld H.

Cultures were maintained from isolation at 37°C in a humidified incubator in 21% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2 (21% O2, normoxia) or in a humidified sealed chamber (Billups-Rothenburg, Del Mar, CA) gassed with 3% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2 (3% O2, chronic hypoxia)(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 3Graven K.K. Troxler R.F. Kornfeld H. Panchenko M.V. Farber H.W. J. Biol.

The partial pressures of oxygen in the media under these conditions are 140 and 40 mm Hg, respectively(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 4Farber H.W. Barnett H.F. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1446-1457Google Scholar). Endothelial cell purity was confirmed by typical cobblestone appearance, factor VIII immunofluorescence, and uptake of fluorescent acetylated low density lipoprotein(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 6Tretyakov A.V. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 738-744Google Scholar). Experiments were performed using 85-90% confluent EC monolayers of passage number 3-10. Control and hypoxic conditions for an individual experiment were performed in parallel on identical cell lines of identical passage number. As a positive control for enolase, H446 cells, a human small-cell lung cancer line (American Type Culture Collection; ATCC, Rockville, MD) were used. Hypoxia associated proteins were induced using EC (3 × 106 cells) maintained chronically in 21% O2 or 3% O2 and then exposed to 0% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2 (O% O2) for various times in a humidified sealed chamber(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 2Graven K.K. Zimmerman L.H. Dickson E.W. Weinhouse G.L. Farber H.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 544-555Google Scholar, 3Graven K.K. Troxler R.F. Kornfeld H. Panchenko M.V. Farber H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24446-24452Google Scholar). The partial pressure of oxygen in the medium under this condition is approximately 20-25 mm Hg (1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 4Farber H.W. Barnett H.F. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1446-1457Google Scholar). After exposure to 0% O2 cells were allowed to recover in 21% O2 for 3 h. In other experiments, EC proteins were radiolabeled with 75 μCi/ml [35S]methionine in methionine-free modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 1 mM sodium pyruvate for the last 1 h of the recovery period. Endothelial cell and H446 monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Whole cell lysates were prepared by solubilization in Laemmli buffer supplemented with aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, boiled for 2 min, and frozen at -20°C until electrophoresis. In some experiments, EC subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously(3Graven K.K. Troxler R.F. Kornfeld H. Panchenko M.V. Farber H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24446-24452Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions were diluted in 5 × sample buffer (3.8 g of Tris, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol v/v, 5 g of SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol v/v in 100 ml) and boiled for 2 min prior to electrophoresis. Whole cell lysates and subcellular fractions were analyzed using 10% SDS-PAGE(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 2Graven K.K. Zimmerman L.H. Dickson E.W. Weinhouse G.L. Farber H.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 544-555Google Scholar, 3Graven K.K. Troxler R.F. Kornfeld H. Panchenko M.V. Farber H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24446-24452Google Scholar). For HAP47 sequencing, a maximal quantity of unlabeled protein was loaded in all but two lanes; these two lanes were loaded with equal radioactive counts of [35S]methionine-labeled protein from normoxic and hypoxic conditions in order to identify the desired band. The radioactive lanes were excised, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1-2 days. The remaining gel containing unlabeled protein was stored in electrophoresis buffer until it was compared with the autoradiograph. Protein bands were visualized with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 50% methanol and destained with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. The band corresponding to HAP47 was excised from eight lanes and combined into a single lane on a second SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis of the second gel, protein was electroblotted onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane and amino-terminal sequencing was performed(3Graven K.K. Troxler R.F. Kornfeld H. Panchenko M.V. Farber H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24446-24452Google Scholar). Initial sequencing with an Applied Biosystems 470A gas phase sequencer equipped with a 120 PTH analyzer was unsuccessful due to amino-terminal blockage. Thus, tryptic digestion, HPLC separation, and protein sequencing were performed by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA)(9Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Google Scholar, 10Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Prot. Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Google Scholar). The two oligopeptide sequences obtained were compared with the ProSwiss and Medline data bases for significant identity. Using equal amounts of protein from whole cell lysates and/or subcellular fractions of EC and H446 per lane, 10% SDS-PAGE was performed. Protein was then electrophoretically transferred in buffer (20% methanol (v/v), 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.3) to nitrocellulose for 2500 mAmp-h. The nitrocellulose membrane was soaked for 1 h in PBST-M (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20 (v/v), 5% non-fat powdered milk (w/v)) to block nonspecific binding. The nitrocellulose membrane was then washed with PBST (same buffer as above without milk) twice for 30 s, once for 15 min, and then twice for 5 min. The polyclonal antibody directed against enolase α- and γ-subunits was diluted in PBST according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated with the nitrocellulose membrane for 1 h. The membrane was washed as before with PBST-M, incubated for 1 h in secondary antibody diluted in PBST-M and washed as before with PBST. Immunodetection was performed with Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent and DuPont Reflection™ film according to the manufacturers' instructions. Protein levels were assessed by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer. In some experiments, antibody was removed from the nitrocellulose membrane by incubating with stripping buffer (100 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) for 30 min at 50°C and washing twice with PBST-M for 10 min at room temperature; immunodetection was repeated to ensure antibody removal. Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for the γ-subunit of enolase was then performed using the same procedure. Total RNA was isolated from cell monolayers with TriReagent-LS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endothelial cells grown long term in 21% O2 were exposed to 0% O2 for various times and then placed in 21% O2 for 1 h. Parallel cultures of control cells were maintained at 21% O2. Fifteen μg of total RNA were separated electrophoretically through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel(11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 4.9.2-4.9.7Google Scholar). After ethidium bromide staining, RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and UV cross-linked (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Prehybridization was performed with QuikHyb solution at 68°C for 1 h. The full-length 1.7-kilobase pair human NNE cDNA (ATCC) was labeled with [α-32P]CTP by the random primer method(12Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 3.5.9-3.5.10Google Scholar). Herring sperm DNA (50 μg/ml QuikHyb) and the NNE probe (1 × 106 cpm/ml QuikHyb) were added, and hybridization was carried out at 68°C for 3 h. The blot was washed with SSC (1 × = 3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate) and SDS as follows: 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C twice for 20 min at room temperature, then once with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 68°C, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 1-4 days. To document equal loading, the nylon membranes were stripped with boiling 0.8% SDS and reprobed with either a human β-actin cDNA probe (ATCC) labeled as above or a 28 S ribosomal RNA oligonucleotide (kind gift of Dr. Alan Fine, Boston University Medical School) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Hybridization signals were quantitated by densitometry and normalized to either actin or 28 S ribosomal levels. Each experiment was performed three to six times; results were reproducible and qualitatively similar independent of passage number or primary cell line used. Results presented are representative examples of each experiment. Tryptic digestion and HPLC separation produced two peptide fragments: one containing 22 amino acids and a second containing 12 amino acids (Fig. 1). Significant identity was found with the glycolytic enzyme enolase. In mammalian species, three genetically distinct subunits, α, β and γ (Mr 47, 44, and 47, respectively) form three dimeric enolase isoforms: NSE (γγ and αγ), NNE (αα), and muscle-specific enolase (MSE, ββ). While bovine enolase has not been sequenced, enolase protein and DNA sequences are known in human, mouse, and rat. The 22-amino acid sequence (excluding a 1-amino acid gap) was 100% identical with each human enolase subunit. The 12-amino acid sequence was 75, 54.5, and 58.3% homologous with the human α-, β-, and γ-subunits, respectively. Since MSE is specific for muscle and composed of lower Mr subunits than HAP47, it was not investigated further. However, both NSE and NNE contain 47-kDa subunits and share significant identity with the HAP47 amino acid sequence. To determine whether one or both of these isoforms is HAP47, Western blot analyses with enolase antibodies were performed. Because a monoclonal antibody specific for the enolase α-subunit is not commercially available, the protein-containing nitrocellulose membranes were hybridized with a polyclonal antibody directed against the α-subunit but known to cross-react with the γ-subunit. The membrane was then washed and rehybridized with a monoclonal antibody specific for the γ isomer. Lysates from H446, a human small-cell lung cancer line which coexpresses NSE and NNE, served as a positive control (Fig. 2). These studies showed that NSE is not present in either normoxic or hypoxic EC and that HAP47 is NNE. Prior studies have demonstrated that HAP47 up-regulation is first detected after 4 h of exposure to 0% O2 and is maximally up-regulated after 18-24 h(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar). Western analysis of whole cell lysates from BAEC grown in 21% O2 and then exposed to 0% O2 for 18 h confirmed NNE protein up-regulation by hypoxia, with a 2-fold increase in protein level (Fig. 2A). Analysis of cytosolic fractions from these cells revealed a 2.3-fold increase in protein levels after 18 h 0% O2 (Fig. 3). Non-neuronal enolase was also consistently found in the nuclear fractions of EC. However, in contrast to cytosolic NNE, the level of NNE present in the nuclear fraction did not change with hypoxia (Fig. 3). A time course analysis of BAEC grown in 21% O2 and exposed to 0% O2 showed that NNE mRNA levels began to rise after 1-2 h of hypoxia, reached a peak increase of 2.7-fold at 18 h, and remained elevated at 48 h. After return of the cells to 21% O2 for 24 h, NNE mRNA levels returned to base line (Fig. 4A). These findings correlate with and slightly precede the time course of HAP47 protein levels (Fig. 4B). Non-neuronal enolase mRNA hypoxic regulation was examined and compared in BAEC and BPAEC grown in either 21% or 3% O2. Bovine aortic EC and BPAEC grown in 21% O2 up-regulated NNE mRNA 2.7- and 3.4-fold, respectively, when exposed to 0% O2 for 18 h (Fig. 5A). Bovine aortic EC and BPAEC grown in 3% O2 had base-line NNE mRNA levels 2-4-fold higher, respectively, than their 21% O2 counterparts (Fig. 5B) and increased NNE mRNA 2.3-fold in hypoxia (Fig. 5C). Comparing NNE mRNA levels for the different EC conditions to the lowest level of NNE mRNA expression (BPAEC maintained in 21% O2), 3% BAEC, and BPAEC up-regulated NNE mRNA to the greatest extent, approximately 10-fold (Fig. 5B).Figure 5:Endothelial cell NNE mRNA levels during hypoxia. Panel A, control BAEC and BPAEC were maintained in either 3% O2 or 21% O2 (C). Parallel cultures of BAEC and BPAEC maintained in either 3% O2 or 21% O2 were subsequently exposed to 0% O2 for 18 h (H). Total RNA was isolated, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to a human full-length NNE cDNA probe (top) and a 28 S ribosomal RNA oligonucleotide probe (bottom), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Densitometric values for NNE mRNA levels were normalized to 28 S ribosomal RNA levels and expressed as a percent of control levels. Panel B, control level of NNE mRNA for each cell type and base-line condition is compared with NNE mRNA level after exposure to 0% O2. Panel C, non-neuronal enolase mRNA level of each cell type and condition is compared with normoxic BPAEC maintained in 21% O2 (21% BPAEC-C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously described the HAPs, a set of cell-associated stress proteins (Mr 34, 36, 39, 47, and 57) up-regulated by hypoxia in cultured EC (1Zimmerman L.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24446-24452Google Scholar) and have identified HAP36 as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase(3Graven K.K. Troxler R.F. Kornfeld H. Panchenko M.V. Farber H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24446-24452Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified HAP47 as NNE by amino acid sequencing of two peptide fragments and Western analysis and have demonstrated that NNE mRNA up-regulation by hypoxia begins at 1-2 h, is maximal at 18 h, persists for at least 48 h, returns to base line after 24 h in 21% O2, and corresponds to the time-course of protein induction. Enolase catalyzes the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. Higher vertebrates possess three enolase genes, encoding α-, β-, and γ-subunits(13Peshavaria M. Quinn G.B. Reeves I. Hinks L.J. Day I.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 254-255Google Scholar). Non-neuronal enolase, a homodimer of 47-kDa α-subunits, is the major isoform during embryogenesis and persists in nearly every adult tissue(14Katagiri T. Feng X. Ichikawa T. Usui H. Takahashi Y. Kumanishi T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 19: 1-8Google Scholar, 15Marangos P.J. Schmechel D.E. Parma A.M. Goodwin F.K. Brain Res. 1980; 190: 185-193Google Scholar). The γ-subunit, also 47 kDa, is found in the γγ and αγ dimers known collectively as NSE(16Tanaka M. Sugisaki K. Nakashima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 868-872Google Scholar, 17Keller A. Berod A. Dussaillant M. Lamande N. Gros F. Lucas M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 493-504Google Scholar). Neuron-specific enolase is expressed mainly in normal and neoplastic cells of neuronal and neuroendocrine origin(18Gerbitz K.D. Summer J. Schumacher I. Arnold H. Kraft A. Mross K. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1986; 24: 1009-1016Google Scholar, 19Isawe K. Nagasaka A. Kato K. Ohtani S. Nagatsu I. Ohyayma T. Nakai A. Aono T. Nakagawa H. Shinoda S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1986; 63: 94-101Google Scholar), but has been found in diverse mammalian cell types(20Schmechel D.E. Lab. Invest. 1985; 52: 239-242Google Scholar, 21Haimoto H. Takahashi Y. Koshikawa T. Nagura H. Kata K. Lab. Invest. 1985; 52: 257-263Google Scholar). Neuron-specific enolase has not been found in EC (21Haimoto H. Takahashi Y. Koshikawa T. Nagura H. Kata K. Lab. Invest. 1985; 52: 257-263Google Scholar) nor has it previously been studied during exposure to hypoxia. The β-subunit forms the homodimeric MSE. It is of a different molecular mass than HAP47 (44 kDa) and is found only in heart and skeletal muscle. How might hypoxia-induced up-regulation of enolase augment hypoxia tolerance in EC? Of interest, hypoxia-sensitive cells, such as renal tubular epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells, do not up-regulate a protein corresponding to enolase when subjected to hypoxic stress(2Graven K.K. Zimmerman L.H. Dickson E.W. Weinhouse G.L. Farber H.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 544-555Google Scholar). In hypoxia-sensitive cell types, decreased oxygen leads to energy insufficiency, followed by increased membrane permeability, loss of ion gradients, and, ultimately, irreversible cellular damage(22Hochachka P.W. Science. 1986; 231: 234-242Google Scholar). In order to obviate these effects, invertebrate cells, which are better able to tolerate hypoxia, employ various protective strategies. These include: (i) increased stores of fermentable fuel, (ii) increased tolerance of metabolic acidosis, (iii) improved handling of intracellular calcium, (iv) metabolic rate depression (metabolic arrest), (v) alterations in cellular membranes to decrease the energy requirements for vital ion pumps (channel arrest), and (vi) ATP regeneration by stores of phosphocreatine(22Hochachka P.W. Science. 1986; 231: 234-242Google Scholar). However, the ability of mammalian cells to employ these strategies appears limited, and, when exposed to hypoxia, most increase glucose utilization via increased rates of glycolysis (Pasteur effect). Endothelial cells appear to respond differently to hypoxia than most mammalian cells. They maintain ATP and GTP levels during extended periods of hypoxia(6Tretyakov A.V. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 738-744Google Scholar, 7Lee S.L. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C766-C770Google Scholar, 8Lee S.L. Fanburg B.L. Circ. Res. 1987; 60: 653-688Google Scholar); however, the cellular mechanisms responsible for maintenance of these high energy phosphates are unknown. Metabolic arrest (6Tretyakov A.V. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 738-744Google Scholar) and augmented phosphocreatine utilization (23Loike J.D. Cao L. Brett J. Ogawa S. Silverstein S.C. Stern D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C326-C333Google Scholar) may occur in hypoxic EC and could be, in part, responsible for EC hypoxia tolerance. Thus, NNE up-regulation might contribute to hypoxia tolerance by augmenting anaerobic energy production and glycolytic competence in EC. Indeed, hypoxic BAEC up-regulate glucose transporter mRNA and protein levels and increase glucose utilization(23Loike J.D. Cao L. Brett J. Ogawa S. Silverstein S.C. Stern D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C326-C333Google Scholar); yet, the Pasteur effect appears to be less significant in EC than in other cell types. Specifically, neither decreased oxygen consumption nor increased lactate production have been demonstrated in EC until ambient oxygen tension falls below 3 mm Hg(24Mertens S. Noll T. Spahr R. Krutzfeldt A. Piper H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H689-H694Google Scholar), implying that glycolysis does not increase until ambient pO2 is below this level. This degree of hypoxia is more extreme than in our system in which the pO2 of medium is 20-25 mm Hg after exposure to 0% O2(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 4Farber H.W. Barnett H.F. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1446-1457Google Scholar). Moreover, HAPs are not up-regulated in EC by either glucose deprivation or inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation(2Graven K.K. Zimmerman L.H. Dickson E.W. Weinhouse G.L. Farber H.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 544-555Google Scholar). Thus, while increased glycolytic metabolism likely contributes to the EC response to extreme hypoxia, it may not fully explain the acquired hypoxia tolerance demonstrated in our system. Perhaps, up-regulation of enolase contributes to hypoxia tolerance through nonglycolytic mechanisms. We and others have speculated that stress responses actively participate in adaptation to cellular hypoxia. Heat shock proteins and GRPs presumably contribute to the acquisition of tolerance to cellular stresses by aiding in protein translocation and refolding after stress (25Hightower L.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 191-197Google Scholar, 26Subjeck J.R. Thung-tai S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C1-C17Google Scholar). They are constitutively expressed in most cell types and are induced by various cellular stresses, including hypoxia(27Knowlton A.A. Brecher P. Apstein C.S. J. Clin.

Hypoxia-associated protein up-regulation is similar to the traditional stress response in that HAP up-regulation occurs in a time and oxygen concentration-dependent manner and occurs despite a concurrent decrease in total cellular protein. However, HAPs are distinct from HSPs and GRPs and appear to be stress- and EC-specific. In addition, while EC up-regulate HSPs and GRPs when exposed to a variety of stimuli, including heat shock, arsenite, and glucose deprivation, they do not up-regulate these traditional stress proteins when exposed to hypoxia. Thus, HAP up-regulation represents an unusual, and perhaps novel, response to hypoxia in EC(1Zimmerman L.H. Levine R.A. Farber H.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 908-914Google Scholar, 2Graven K.K.

Like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (HAP36) and other glycolytic enzymes, enolase may have important cellular functions separate from its catalytic function. For instance, enolase binds to F-actin and tubulin (30Walsh J.L. Keith T.J. Knull H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 64-70Google Scholar, 31Walsh J. Knull H.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Mammalian enolases may also play isoform-specific roles in enhanced cell survival. For instance, while both NSE and NNE are present in cultured rat neocortical neurons, only NSE appears to promote survival (41Hattori T. Ohsawa K. Mizuno Y. Kato K. Kohsaka S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 25-30Google Scholar). Similarly, NNE may serve a specific function in promoting EC survival in hypoxia. In this regard, a recent report suggests an association between enolase and c-myc, a proto-oncogene that plays a major role in the control of cell proliferation(42Campisi J. Gray H.E. Pardee A.B. Dean M. Sonenshein G.E. Cell. 1984; 37: 241-247Google Scholar, 43Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2154-2161Google Scholar). This report (43Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2154-2161Google Scholar) has identified a 35-40 kDa protein, MBP-1, that binds to and may negatively regulate the P2 promoter of c-myc in HeLa cells. Of interest, the two oligopeptides obtained in the sequencing of HAP47 were 100% homologous with MBP-1. Overall, MBP-1 is 79.8 and 68% homologous with the 215-amino acid carboxyl terminus of human NSE and NNE, respectively. While this homology may represent evolutionary colineage and not a functional similarity between these proteins, it is an intriguing possibility that enolase acts as a transcriptional regulator of c-myc. In summary, we have identified the glycolytic enzyme NNE as HAP47, one of a distinct family of EC proteins up-regulated specifically by hypoxia. We speculate that enolase contributes directly to the hypoxia tolerance demonstrated by EC and does so, in part, through nonglycolytic mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2009719824,"It has recently been reported that protein-tyrosine kinase activity is required for thrombin-induced growth in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In the present study, we have identified several phosphoproteins that are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to thrombin in quiescent VSMC. These proteins are insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor β-subunit (IGF-IRβ), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1). Thrombin-stimulated phosphorylation of these proteins was rapid; it was maximal at 1 min and reduced thereafter. Thrombin also activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in quiescent VSMC in a biphasic manner with a rapid and larger peak at 10 min (6-fold) followed by a sustained smaller second peak at 2 h (2-fold). Inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinase activity by the use of two structurally different protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and herbimycin A, significantly blocked the thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1Rβ, IRS-1, and PLC-γ1 and decreased thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis. In contrast, however, inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinase activity had no effect on thrombin activation of MAPK. Collectively, these findings suggest a role for tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-IRβ, IRS-1, and PLC-γ1 in thrombin-induced mitogenic signaling events in VSMC. Furthermore, while protein tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for thrombin-induced DNA synthesis, it is not required for thrombin-stimulated MAPK activation.

Several molecules including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-A and -B), fibroblast growth factor, and angiotensin II appear to be involved in the induction of paracrine and autocrine growth in VSMC(1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Google Scholar). More recently it has been reported that thrombin, a serine protease, in addition to its role in blood coagulation also stimulates growth in certain cell types, notably fibroblasts and VSMC(2Weiss R.H.

In further support of an important role of thrombin in this vascular lesion formation, it has been documented that hirudin, a specific inhibitor of thrombin, reduces neointimal formation(4Melzig M.

Thrombin is thought to transmit both its coagulant and mitogenic effects via activation of its receptor, a transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor, which is identical with or similar to the one we and others recently cloned(6Vu T.K.H. Huang D. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 7Zhong C. Hayzer D.J. Corson M.A. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16975-16979Google Scholar). The observation that hirudin but not the anticoagulant heparin inhibited formation of a neointima suggests that the coagulant and mitogenic effects of thrombin are regulated by differential mechanisms or that there may be more than one type of thrombin receptor(5Sarembock I.J. Gertz S.D. Gimple L.W. Owen R.M. Powers E.R. Roberts W.C. Circulation. 1991; 84: 232-239Google Scholar). In fact, using thrombin receptor-activating peptides and protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors some investigators have demonstrated that along with activation of its G-protein-coupled receptor, thrombin also requires protein-tyrosine kinase activity, possibly of a receptor type for its mitogenic effect (2Weiss R.H. Nuccitelli R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5608-5613Google Scholar, 3Vouret-Craviari V. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Rasmussen U.B. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 95-102Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are implicated in the transmission of growth signals from activated receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors(8Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Google Scholar, 9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). MAPK are a family of serine/threonine kinases, which are activated by phosphorylation both at threonine and tyrosine residues. These reactions are catalyzed by a dual specificity enzyme MAPK kinase, also termed MEK(10Ray L.B. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3753-3757Google Scholar, 11Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Google Scholar). MEK itself is activated by at least two types of kinases, Raf-1(12Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L.

Raf-1, which is also activated by phosphorylation, appears to be central in receiving signals from activated upstream kinases such as receptor tyrosine kinases(9Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar, 15Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Google Scholar), protein kinase C(16Burgering B.M.T. deVries-Smits A.M.M. Medema R.H.

This serine/threonine kinase pathway is thought to be involved in the convergence of growth-initiated early protein-tyrosine kinase signaling events and the subsequent transduction of these signals into the nucleus(19Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Google Scholar). Since thrombin is an effector of several important cellular processes and is active in many pathological conditions, it is important to understand precisely the signaling events by which this protease deciphers its diverse biological effects. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate signaling events, particularly the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation in thrombin-induced growth of VSMC. We report several novel observations. First, thrombin stimulates VSMC DNA synthesis, and tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including IGF-1R, IRS-1, and PLC-γ1, is associated with this phenomena. Second, thrombin activated MAPK in a biphasic manner in quiescent VSMC. Third, inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinase activity blocked the thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R, IRS-1, and PLC-γ1 and DNA synthesis but not thrombin-induced MAPK activation, suggesting that the activity of MAPK is dissociated from early protein-tyrosine kinase events induced by thrombin in VSMC. Fourth, thrombin activated Src rapidly in quiescent VSMC, a result that suggests a possible role for this nonreceptor type protein-tyrosine kinase in the cross-talk between the thrombin-bound G-protein-coupled receptor and a protein-tyrosine kinase receptor such as IGF-1R. Aprotinin, ATP, bovine myelin basic protein (MBP), EGTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium deoxycholate, and sodium orthovanadate were obtained from Sigma. Anti-ERK-1, ERK-2, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor β-subunit, IRS-1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal mouse anti-bovine PLC-γ1 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Genistein and herbimycin A were from Biomole (Plymouth Meeting, PA). [methyl-3H]Thymidine (70 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (8000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aortae of 200-250-g male Sprague-Dawley rats by enzymatic digestion as described earlier(20Rao G.N. Baas A.S. Glasgow W.C. Eling T.E. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32586-32591Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. VSMC were plated onto 60-mm dishes, allowed to grow to 70-80% confluence, and then growth-arrested by incubation in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum for 72 h. Growth-arrested VSMC were exposed to various agonists at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. Cells were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 2 h just before the end of the incubation period with agonists and harvested by trypsinization followed by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and vortexed vigorously to lyse the cells. The mixture was allowed to sit on ice for 20 min and then passed through a GF/F glass microfiber filter. The filter was washed once with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with cold 70% ethanol, dried, and placed in a liquid scintillation vial containing the mixture, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 3801). Growth-arrested VSMC were incubated at 37°C in the presence or absence of various agonists for the indicated time periods. Medium was then aspirated, and cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Two-hundred fifty microliters of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) was added to the frozen monolayers, thawed on ice for 15 min, and scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Protein content of the supernatant was determined using Bio-Rad's Bradford reagent. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on a 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Corp.). After blocking in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the membrane was treated with appropriate primary antibodies followed by incubation with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Corp.). Cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins (50 μg/lane) from each treatment were resolved on a 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide minigel copolymerized with 350 μg/ml MBP (21Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Google Scholar). The gel was washed twice for 30 min with 150 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20% isopropyl alcohol and twice for 30 min with 150 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A). After incubation for 1 h in 150 ml of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride in buffer A at room temperature, the gel was renatured by repeated washings with buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 20 at 4°C. The kinase reaction was performed by incubating the gel in 30 ml of 40 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM ATP, and 5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at room temperature. The gel was then washed several times with 200 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate until the counts/min were at background levels, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Src activation was determined essentially according to the method described by Gould and Hunter(22Gould K.L. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3345-3356Google Scholar). Growth-arrested VSMC were labeled with 300 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h at 37°C in phosphate-free DMEM. VSMC were then stimulated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for various time periods in the presence and absence of genistein. Cells were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer as described above. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4°C. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts/min were then incubated with 50 μl of monoclonal Src antibodies (clone 2037D10) for 2 h followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 1 h on ice with gentle rocking. The beads were then collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C in a microcentrifuge and washed five times with cold lysis buffer. The beads were suspended in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and heated in boiling water for 5 min, and the proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film with an intensifying screen at -70°C for 1-2 h. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with various concentrations of thrombin (0.025-0.2 unit/ml) for 24 h, and DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Thrombin stimulated VSMC DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Increases in VSMC DNA synthesis were caused by thrombin at a concentration as low as 0.025 unit/ml. A maximum 20-fold increase in VSMC DNA synthesis was observed with 0.1 unit/ml thrombin, a result that indicates that thrombin is capable of causing growth in VSMC. To determine whether thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis requires protein-tyrosine kinase activity, growth-arrested VSMC were treated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of 25 μM genistein and/or 1 μM herbimycin A, two structurally different but potent protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors(23Uckun F.M. Evans W.E. Forsyth C.J. Waddick K.G. Ahlgren L.T. Chelstrom L.M. Burhardt A. Bolen J. Myers D.E. Science. 1995; 267: 886-891Google Scholar, 24Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Google Scholar), and DNA synthesis was measured. Genistein inhibits receptor and non-receptor type protein-tyrosine kinase activity by competing with ATP(25Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Google Scholar), while herbimycin A inhibits cellular protein-tyrosine kinase activities, such as Src irreversibly by a mechanism involving interactions of benzoquinone with protein sulfhydryl groups(26Uehara Y. Hori M. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2198-2206Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, both genistein and herbimycin A significantly blocked thrombin-induced DNA synthesis. Genistein and herbimycin A toxicity was determined by measuring cell viability by trypan blue dye exclusion assay 48 h after exposing VSMC to these compounds. At the concentrations used in these studies, these compounds were not toxic. Higher concentrations (50 μM genistein and 10 μM herbimycin A) were found to be toxic to VSMC with a longer incubation period. Therefore, inhibition of DNA synthesis by genistein and herbimycin A suggests that protein-tyrosine kinase activity is required for thrombin-induced growth in VSMC.Figure 2:Protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors attenuate thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in VSMC. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of herbimycin A (1 μM) or genistein (25 μM) for 24 h, and DNA synthesis was measured as described in the legend for Fig. 1.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Google Scholar). To identify the proteins that were potentially tyrosine-phosphorylated by, and involved in, thrombin-induced mitogenic signaling, growth-arrested VSMC were treated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for various time periods, and cell extracts were prepared. Extracts of thrombin-treated and untreated VSMC containing equal amounts of proteins (100 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies. We detected three phosphoproteins with apparent molecular masses of 100, 140, and 180 kDa, whose tyrosine phosphorylation in response to thrombin increased rapidly (Fig. 3). Maximum 2-3-fold increases in the phosphotyrosine content of these proteins were observed at 1 min of thrombin treatment, gradually decreasing thereafter. The apparent molecular masses of these three phosphoproteins (100, 140, and 180 kDa) appeared to fall within the range of molecular masses reported for IGF-IRβ, PLC-γ1, and IRS-1, respectively(31Adamo M. Roberts C.T. LeRoith D. Biofactors. 1992; 3: 151-157Google Scholar, 32Margolis G. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzki A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1101-1107Google Scholar). To establish the identity of these proteins, equal amounts of proteins (500 μg) from thrombin-treated and untreated VSMC were immunoprecipitated with anti-IGF-IRβ, anti-PLC-γ1, or anti-IRS-1 antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting using phosphotyrosine antibodies. Phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis of anti-IGF-IRβ immunoprecipitates detected a band with a molecular mass of 100 kDa, whose phosphorylation was increased severalfold in response to thrombin, and this response was sensitive to inhibition by genistein (Fig. 4). Phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis of anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates showed a band of 180 kDa in size, and its phosphotyrosine content was increased 2.5-fold by thrombin (Fig. 4). Genistein inhibited the thrombin's effect on IRS-1 phosphorylation. The identity of the 140-kDa protein as PLC-γ1 was also established using a similar approach (Fig. 4). It has recently been reported that Src phosphorylates IGF-1R in Rat-1 fibroblasts(33Peterson J.E. Jelinek T. Kaleko M. Siddle K. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate a possible mechanism by which thrombin stimulates IGF-1R phosphorylation, thrombin's effect of Src activation in growth-arrested VSMC was determined. As shown in Fig. 5, thrombin activated Src rapidly in VSMC with a maximum effect at 1 min (3-fold). In addition, thrombin activation of Src was found to be sensitive to protein-tyrosine kinase inhibition (Fig. 5). Collectively these findings strongly suggest a role for tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R, IRS-1, PLC-γ1, and Src in thrombin-initiated mitogenic signaling events.Figure 4:Thrombin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R, IRS-1, and PLCγ-1, and protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors abrogate these responses. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in the presence and absence of herbimycin A (H) (1 μM) or genistein (G) (25 μM) for the indicated time periods, and cell extracts were prepared. Five hundred micrograms of protein from each treatment was incubated with IGF-1Rβ, IRS-1, or PLCγ-1 antibodies overnight, and the immunoprecipitates were Western blot analyzed using phosphotyrosine antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5:Thrombin activation of Src.

Equal amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts/min from each treatment were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal Src antibodies, and the immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It was thought that early protein tyrosine phosphorylation events such as receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation transmit mitogenic signals by activation of a “Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK” pathway via recruitment of adaptor molecules such as GRB2, Shc, and SOS(19Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Google Scholar, 34Oliver J.P. Raabe T. Henkemeyer M. Dickson B. Mbamalu G. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Hafen E. Pawson T.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 27645-27649Google Scholar). Since thrombin requires protein-tyrosine kinase activity for its mitogenic effect and IGF-IR phosphorylation is associated with this, it is paradoxical and intriguing that these tyrosine phosphorylation events may be required for thrombin's activation of the “Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK” pathway. Several experiments were performed to test this hypothesis. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for various time periods as well as in the presence and absence of protein-tyrosine kinase activity inhibitors, and cell lysates were prepared. MAPK activities in cell lysates were determined by 1) in-gel kinase assay using MBP as a substrate and 2) detection by mobility shift of phosphorylated MAPK on Western blots. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of proteins from control and various treatments were resolved by SDS-PAGE copolymerized with MBP, and the kinase assay was performed by incubating the gel in the kinase buffer containing [γ32P]ATP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thrombin activated MAPK in a time-dependent biphasic manner with the first and highest peak of activity (6-fold) at 10 min, followed by a second and more sustained lower peak of activity (2-fold) at 2 h (Fig. 6). These results are in agreement with previous reports in hamster fibroblasts(37Meloche S. Seuven K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Google Scholar). Genistein or herbimycin A alone had no effect on MAPK activities in VSMC and did not block the thrombin-stimulated activation of MAPK in these cells (Fig. 6). The lack of the effect of genistein on thrombin-stimulated activation of MAPK is selective, because it blocked the serum-induced activation of MAPK in VSMC (Fig. 7). In fact, Winitz et al.(18Winitz S. Russell M. Qian N.X. Gardner A. Dwyer L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19196-19199Google Scholar) and Hawes et al.(38Hawes B.E. VanBiesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Google Scholar) also observed that genistein, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, did not block the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor, mediated activation of MAPK, while it inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated activation of MAPK.Figure 7:Genistein blocks the serum-induced activation of MAPK. Growth-arrested VSMC were treated with and without serum (10%, v/v) in the presence and absence of genistein (G) (25 μM) for 5 min, and cell extracts were prepared. MAPK activity was measured as described in the legend for Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These findings provide the first demonstration that thrombin, a G-protein-coupled receptor agonist, stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R, a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. IGF-1R consists of two α (135 kDa) and two β (95 kDa) subunits linked by disulfide bonds. Ligand binding to the extracellular α-subunit of the receptor produces a conformational change in the β-subunits resulting in autophosphorylation, which is required for its kinase activity. In turn the activated receptor phosphorylates several proteins including its immediate substrate IRS-1(39Giorgetti S. Ballotti R. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Tartare S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7358-7364Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IRS-1 interacts with downstream signaling molecules such as GRB2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase via Src homology 2 (SH2) domains(40Baltensperger K. Kozma L.M. Cherniak A.D.

Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Google Scholar). IGF-1R has a critical role in transmitting its ligand-evoked cellular effects(19Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Google Scholar, 42White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 429-441Google Scholar), and the importance of IGF-1R phosphorylation in cell growth and transformation has also been demonstrated(39Giorgetti S. Ballotti R. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Tartare S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7358-7364Google Scholar, 43Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Google Scholar). In fact, Peterson et al.(33Peterson J.E. Jelinek T. Kaleko M. Siddle K. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27315-27321Google Scholar) recently reported ligand-independent phosphorylation of IGF-1R in Src-transformed fibroblasts. This work also showed that Src-induced intracellular phosphorylation events are required for IGF-1R phosphorylation in these cells. A similar mechanism may account for thrombin-induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R in VSMC. This suggestion is based on the following observations. 1) Thrombin activated Src in VSMC, and 2) this event is temporally correlated with phosphorylation of IGF-1R by thrombin. As thrombin-induced early protein tyrosine phosphorylation events include phosphorylation of Src, IGF-1R, IRS-1, and PLC-γ1 and inhibition of protein-tyrosine kinase activity blocks thrombin's phosphorylation of these molecules and DNA synthesis, it is likely that thrombin-induced Src, IGF-1R, IRS-1, and PLC-γ1 phosphorylation are closely associated with thrombin's mitogenic signaling events in VSMC. Several investigators have established that ligand-induced receptor tyrosine kinase activation is essential for MAPK activation(19Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Google Scholar, 34Oliver J.P. Raabe T. Henkemeyer M. Dickson B. Mbamalu G. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Hafen E. Pawson T.

Kahn C.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 429-441Google Scholar). MAPK are important in regulating transcriptional factors such as c-jun, c-myc, and p62TCF(44Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A.

Wayne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar), and they in turn modulate gene transcription. Although our findings demonstrate a biphasic activation of MAPK by thrombin this event appears to be dissociated from tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R, IRS-1, PLC-γ1, and Src, since inhibiting phosphorylation of these molecules had no effect on thrombin-induced activation of MAPK. On the other hand, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R, IRS-1, PLC-γ1, and Src appears to be on the pathway that leads to DNA synthesis because inhibiting protein-tyrosine kinase activity blocked phosphorylation of these molecules as well as DNA synthesis. Pages et al.(47Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our findings and those of Pages et al.(47Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Google Scholar) imply that the tyrosine phosphorylation events that we observed and the MAPK cascade are independently regulated by thrombin, and both are required for DNA synthesis. If both the MAPK pathway and protein-tyrosine kinase events are required for DNA synthesis, then interference with either pathway will affect growth. Another explanation is that both thrombin-induced IGF-1R, IRS-1, PLC-γ, and Src tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK activation events may converge downstream to inhibition by protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thrombin-stimulated MAPK activation may be mediated by a mechanism involving protein kinase C. In fact, thrombin has been shown to activate protein kinase C in other cell types (48Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6044-6050Google Scholar) and angiotensin II, a G-protein-coupled receptor agonist, reportedly activated MAPK by a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism in VSMC(49Tsuda T. Kawahara Y. Ishida Y. Koide M. Shii K. Yokoyama M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 620-630Google Scholar). Future studies are required to elucidate the requirement for MAPK activation for thrombin-induced DNA synthesis and whether serine/threonine kinases interact with protein tyrosine phosphorylation events to cause DNA synthesis in VSMC.

Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Google Scholar). The effect of IFN-γ in epithelial cells is biphasic. The first phase consists of cell proliferation arrest, which is subsequently followed by a second phase of cell death, which has the characteristics of programed cell death, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and condensation and fragmentation of nuclear chromatin(13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar). The approach developed, termed technical knockout (TKO), is based on random inactivation of genes by transfection of HeLa cells with an antisense cDNA expression library, cloned into an Epstein-Barr virus-based episomal vector (pTKO1). The HeLa cells were then exposed to the selective pressure of IFN-γ over a 4-week period. At the end of the selection period, only cells that were protected from the effect of IFN-γ had survived. interferon-γ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis open reading frame. The antisense cDNA clones rescued from these cells were tested in secondary transfections for their ability to reduce the susceptibility of HeLa cells to IFN-γ. Those that were positively scored were sequenced, and novel fragments were then used to probe a full-length cDNA library. Out of the genes rescued, by this method, one turned out to be the gene coding for thioredoxin(12Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Google Scholar). Recently, two other novel genes have been described. The first, DAP1 (death-associated protein-1), is a basic, proline-rich 15-kDa protein. The second, DAPk (death-associated protein kinase), is a novel Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase that carries eight ankyrin repeats and a “death” domain(13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar, 14Feinstein E. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Kimchi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Google Scholar). In this work, we describe the isolation and characterization of a fourth gene, DAP3 (death-associated protein-3). The construction of the HeLa cDNA library and cloning into pTKO1 vector were performed as described(12Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Google Scholar). Transfection of the antisense cDNA library into HeLa cells was done by the standard calcium phosphate technique. The pTKO1 vectors carrying antisense cDNA fragments were isolated as described(12Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Google Scholar, 13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar). Two secondary polyclonal populations, expressing the DAP3 antisense cDNA HindIII-BamHI fragment, were generated by secondary transfection of subconfluent monolayers of HeLa cells with 40 μg of the corresponding plasmid (named pTKO1-259). Pools of 104 independent stable clones were generated from each transfection. Transfectants were maintained as stable polyclonal populations with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). A radiolabeled cDNA insert from pTKO1-259 was used to screen a λgt10 amplified cDNA library from K562 cells. Approximately 2 × 106 plaque-forming units were screened with the 259 cDNA insert, and 10 positive clones were isolated. Plaque hybridization was performed under stringent conditions. One clone, carrying the longest sense cDNA insert, was chosen for further work. The insert was subcloned into a Bluescript vector (Stratagene). Sequencing of both strands was done by primer walking, fully automated on an Applied Biosystems DNA 373A sequencer. The sequence was used to search the data bases, applying FASTA (Genetics Computer Group package) at the nucleotide level and FASTS, BLASTP, and BLOCKS at the protein level(15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar, 16Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6565-6572Google Scholar). The MOTIF program (Genetics Computer Group software package) was used to analyze the sequence for potential motifs. The different transfected polyclonal HeLa cell populations were grown in 96-well microtiter plates. The initial number of cells was 15,000/well, and the cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) and 1% glutamine. Treated cells were exposed to IFN-γ (1000 units/ml) over a 12-day period (human recombinant IFN-γ, PeproTech); fresh medium and IFN-γ were supplemented every 4 days. At the indicated days, viable cells were stained with neutral red (Sigma) as described previously(17Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2464-2469Google Scholar). Dye uptake was measured in quadruplicate using an automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at λ = 540 nm. Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells using Trireagent (Molecular Research Center Inc.) and from normal human tissue as described(18Chenchik A.A. Diachenko L.B. Beabealashvilli R.S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 98-101Google Scholar). Samples of 20 μg of total RNA or 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were separated on 1% agarose gels and hybridized to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.) as described(19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA probes were prepared using [α-32P]dCTP with commercially available random priming kits (Boehringer Mannheim). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing of filters were performed as described(20Yarden A. Kimchi A. Science. 1986; 234: 1419-1421Google Scholar). The blots were exposed for as long as indicated on x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The antibodies were generated in two rabbits as described(21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antigen injected was glutathione S-transferase-DAP3 fusion protein excised from the gel. Antiserum from the 3rd week after the last boost was depleted of the anti-glutathione S-transferase antibodies by passing the antiserum through CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) coupled to glutathione S-transferase. Titration and specificity of antibodies were determined, after depletion, by Western analysis of recombinant DAP3. HeLa cells were harvested, and protein extracts were prepared as described previously(13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar). The protein samples (200 μg/lane) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell) with a semidry semi-phor blotter (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). The blots were reacted with each of the two different polyclonal antibodies, and immunodetection was done using the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.). The full-length cDNA insert cloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene) was used as a template for in vitro transcription from the T7 promoter. RNA (1 μg) was translated in the reticulocyte lysate (Promega) with [35S]methionine as a labeled precursor. The reaction products were resolved by separation on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. To amplify the signal, the gel was immersed for 60 min in 10% acetic acid, rinsed in double distilled water for 10 min, and immersed in salicylic acid (1 M solution) for 20 min. The gel was dried and exposed for 1 h to x-ray film (Kodak) at -80°C with an intensifying screen. The DAP3 gene was cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) downstream of a cytomegalovirus promoter and transfected into HeLa cells (30 μg/5 × 105 cells) as described(13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar). Empty vector was used as a control. Two days after transfection, G418 was added to the medium (800 μg/ml). The different cells were grown for an additional 10 days, and at that time, the number of stable clones in the control transfections that were resistant to G418 was scored. Transfections with DAP3 were scored after 3 weeks. As described previously(13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar), HeLa cells were transfected with the antisense cDNA library, and selective pressure of both IFN-γ (750 units/ml) and hygromycin B (200 μg/ml) was applied over a 4-week period. The DNA plasmids extracted from the surviving clones were classified into six nonoverlapping groups according to cross-hybridization on Southern blots. The group of DAP3 was composed of only a single member carrying a novel DNA fragment that was 252 base pairs long and was termed clone 259 (Table 1 in (13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar)). The pTKO1-259 plasmid was then transfected in duplicate into HeLa cells, and two stable polyclonal cell populations were generated and maintained with hygromycin B (designated 259-t1 and 259-t2).TABLE I Open table in a new tab The effect of pTKO1-259 in protecting the cells from the IFN-γ-induced antiproliferative and cell death effects was then examined. This was accomplished by comparing the residual cell viability, after IFN-γ treatment, between the antisense RNA-expressing cell populations and a nonrelevant polyclonal population of HeLa cells transfected with a pTKO1-DHFR control vector(12Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Google Scholar). The assay was performed by using neutral dye uptake into cells as a measure of viability (Fig. 1). During the first 4 days after exposure to IFN-γ, the cells stopped proliferating, but remained viable as previously detailed(13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar). This is due to the initial cytostatic effect of IFN-γ. During this period, all cell populations behaved in a relatively similar manner, as deduced from microscopic observations (data not shown) and from the similar values of decline in neutral red dye uptake. However, there was a clear difference in viability of the different cell populations from day 4 after IFN-γ treatment and later on. The pTKO1-DHFR-transfected cells displayed rapid and massive cell death, resulting in <5% cell viability on day 8 of IFN-γ treatment. The two polyclonal cell populations that expressed antisense RNA displayed, however, reduced susceptibility to the death-inducing effect of IFN-γ (~40% cell viability on day 8 of IFN-γ treatment). These data indicate that expression of antisense RNA from DAP3 protects the HeLa cells exclusively from IFN-γ-induced cell death and not from its cytostatic action. The growth curves of 259-t1 and 259-t2 and of the pTKO1-DHFR-transfected cells, which were kept in the absence of IFN-γ, were indistinguishable (data not shown), suggesting that antisense RNA expression has no effect on the normal growth of the cells. The pattern of RNA expression was then determined. The 252-base pair DNA fragment carried by pTKO1-259 hybridized on Northern blots to a single endogenous 1.7-kilobase mRNA transcript in the control HeLa cell cultures (Fig. 2A). In the 259-t1 cell culture, the antisense RNA was also detected, having the predicted size of 1 kilobase (comprising the 252 bases of the cDNA insert and 800 bases of sequence from the expression cassette)(12Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Google Scholar). The levels of antisense RNA exceeded by ~5-fold that of the endogenous DAP3 sense mRNA. Addition of IFN-γ caused a further induction of antisense expression, bringing it to exceed the DAP3 mRNA by 30-fold (Fig. 2A). This was due to the presence of an interferon-stimulated response element in the pTKO1 vector. The endogenous 1.7-kilobase mRNA did not appear to be influenced by IFN-γ; it appeared as a single transcript also when the full-length cDNA was used as a probe. The antisense fragment was then used to screen a K562 cDNA library constructed in the λgt10 vector. A cDNA clone that spanned 1560 base pairs was chosen for sequencing. The sequence analysis of DAP3 cDNA confirmed the antisense orientation of the HindIII-BamHI insert of pTKO1-259 and the fact that it lies within the coding region of the DAP3 mRNA (Fig. 3A). The sequence contains a single ORF starting at position 74 and ending at position 1268 with a stop codon. A polyadenylation signal (AATTA) is found at position 1517, and polyadenylation itself starts at position 1555 (Fig. 3B). The ORF codes for a potential protein of 398 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of ~46 kDa. A search of the data bases for possible homologies has not resulted in any significant matches. However, analysis of the protein sequence with the MOTIF program indicated that the protein contains a potential P-loop motif. This potential domain was identified through the consensus sequence (G/A)XXXXGK(T/S) at positions 128-135 and implies that DAP3 is a potential ATP/GTP-binding protein. No indications of the presence of a signal peptide or a transmembrane domain have been found (SAPS prediction). An in vitro translation assay in the reticulocyte lysate confirmed the ORF prediction. The translation products of DAP3 cDNA were fractionated by SDS-PAGE to two closely migrating bands (Fig. 2B). The upper band corresponds to a protein of ~46 kDa. The lower, less abundant band is most probably due to alternative initiation of translation from a ATG codon that is in frame 24 amino acids downstream from the first ATG codon and hence represents a protein of ~42 kDa. This possibility is proposed since substitution of 2 base pairs upstream to the first ATG codon changed the ratio between these two bands in favor of the faster migrating form (data not shown). The expression of DAP3 was then measured in HeLa cells using polyclonal antibodies made against the bacterially produced DAP3 protein. The antibodies recognize in HeLa cells a prominent band of 46 kDa, a mass consistent with the in vitro translated protein. In pTKO1-DHFR-transfected cells, DAP3 protein levels were elevated by ~2-fold at 48 h after addition of IFN-γ. In contrast, the 259-t1 cell culture, which expresses DAP3 antisense RNA, displayed a 2-3-fold reduction in DAP3 protein levels 48 h after addition of IFN-γ to the growth medium (Fig. 2C). The high antisense RNA levels detected in the presence of IFN-γ therefore reduced the steady-state levels of the corresponding DAP3 protein by ~6-fold. As the DAP3 antisense RNA did not seem to reduce endogenous DAP3 mRNA levels, it seems likely that the antisense RNA exerts its effect by inhibiting, directly or indirectly, the translation of the DAP3 mRNA transcript. Since DAP3 is a mediator of IFN-γ cell death, it was plausible that elevated levels of the protein, by ectopic expression, may cause cell death on its own. To answer this question, HeLa cells were transfected with DAP3 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and in parallel with a control vector, both carrying a gene conferring resistance to G418. Following transfection, G418 was added to the growth medium, and the number of colonies was subsequently scored (Table 1). As evident from the data presented in Table 1, ectopic expression of DAP3 resulted in a 16-fold reduction in the number of G418-resistant HeLa colonies. Examination of the DAP3-transfected cells early after transfection (4-5 days, before mock transfectants are killed by the drug) revealed that a large portion of the transfectants rounded up and died. Moreover, at day 10, the colonies of the antibiotic-resistant stable cytomegalovirus-DAP3 transfectants were much smaller than the colonies of the control transfectants and grew thereafter at a slow rate. These results were repeated in three independent transfections, each carried out in triplicate and with different preparations of plasmid DNA in each experiment. In attempt to study the pattern of DAP3 expression, the tissue distribution of DAP3 mRNA was determined. A Northern blot containing mRNA from different human tissues was probed with the DAP3 antisense cDNA fragment (Fig. 4). The results indicate that DAP3 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues analyzed. A 2-fold higher level of mRNA expression was found in lung tissue. IFN-γ induces a type of cell death that has the characteristics of programed cell death. These features include chromatin condensation and segmentation, nuclear pyknosis, surface blebbing, budding off of cytoplasmic projections, and disappearance of surface microvilli(13Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous reports suggesting that IFN-γ has a role in the negative selection of T- and B-lymphocytes(22Grawunder U. Melchers F. Rolink A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 544-551Google Scholar, 23Liu Y. Janeway C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1735-1739Google Scholar). Hence, study of the genes mediating this effect should contribute to the elucidation of basic mechanisms underlying programed cell death. To date, only a few positive mediators of cell death have been identified in mammalian systems. Some, like p53 and c-myc, were well known for their other functions, and only later was their involvement in apoptotic cell death established(2Yonish-Rouach E. Reznitzki D. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kimchi A. Oren M. Nature. 1991; 352: 345-347Google Scholar, 24Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wylie A.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 849-852Google Scholar, 25Lowe S.W.

Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Google Scholar). Others, like nur77, were isolated by the subtractive hybridization approach of gene cloning and subsequently proved by functional assays to be indispensable in certain apoptotic systems(7Woronicz J.D. Cainan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Google Scholar, 8Liu Z.-G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborn B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Google Scholar). The powerful genetic tools available in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which led to the rescue of positive mediators of cell death such as ced-3 and ced-4, were another starting point for the isolation of mammalian homologs. This led to the identification of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme as a potential mediator of cell death as well as to the recent isolation of other members of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme/ced-3 family(3Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Google Scholar, 5Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Google Scholar, 6Nicholson W.D. Ambereen A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar, 27Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Development (Camb.). 1992; 116: 309-320Google Scholar). Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance of proteases in the process of cell death(28Vaux D.L. Haecker G. Strasser A. Cell. 1994; 76: 777-779Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that, consistent with our previous reports, applying the functional approach of antisense knockout is a successful strategy for the isolation of novel genes that function as positive mediators of cell death. A growth advantage, conferred by expression of antisense RNA, serves as a strong positive selection measure in an environment restrictive due to the presence of IFN-γ. The isolation of DAP3 as a mediator of IFN-γ-induced cell death is reported here. Transfection of cells with the antisense cDNA protected them from cell death in a clear manner, as judged by the nearly 10-fold enhanced viability in the continuous presence of IFN-γ. Yet, the antisense RNA did not have an effect on the cytostatic effect of IFN-γ, implying that these two processes are distinct. Ectopic expression of DAP3 alone caused massive cell death early after transfection and, as a consequence, a 16-fold reduction in the number of G418-resistant colonies. The ability of DAP3 to cause such a phenotype is consistent with its role as a mediator of cell death. The single 1.7-kilobase mRNA of DAP3 has a single ORF coding for a 46-kDa protein. This was confirmed by in vitro translation of the mRNA in the reticulocyte lysate. The mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined at comparable levels. This further suggests that the role of DAP3 as a positive mediator of cell death is not restricted to certain tissues or inducers or, alternatively, may hint at additional, yet undefined functions. As the sequence of DAP3 shares no homology with known proteins, it is difficult at this stage to assign a role for DAP3 in the process of IFN-γ-induced cell death. The potential P-loop motif, which is the only motif found in DAP3 by use of computer searches, was compared with the consensus P-loop domain in the seven classified families of ATP- or GTP-binding proteins(29Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Google Scholar). No similarity was found, and further work is needed to verify that this element is indeed a legitimate P-loop. In our system, applying the approach of functional inactivation of genes has so far resulted in the identification of four different genes. One of these genes is the one coding for thioredoxin, a protein that reduces the intramolecular thiol groups that form disulfide bonds, suggesting that changes in the redox state of certain proteins are crucial for mediating IFN-γ-induced cell death(12Deiss L.P. Kimchi A. Science. 1991; 252: 117-120Google Scholar). The other three genes identified so far code for novel proteins: DAP1, DAPk, and DAP3. This method of functional selection has proved fruitful in other systems as well. For instance, expression selection by the use of genetic suppressor elements was used to clone genes involved in mediating the effect of the anticancer drug etoposide(30Gudkov V.A. Kazarov R.A. Thimmapaya R. Axenovich A.S. Mazo A.I. Roninson B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3744-3748Google Scholar). The recent identification and isolation of Requiem, which is a positive mediator of cell death induced by interleukin-3 deprivation, was based on a similar strategy(31Gabig T.G. Mantel P.L. Rosli R. Crean C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29515-29519Google Scholar). These data combine to demonstrate the feasibility of isolating positive mediators of cell death utilizing functional knockout approaches. Use of these approaches will no doubt enhance the understanding of the pathways underlying the mechanisms of cell death. We thank Dr. Elena Feinstein for helpful discussions and Dr. E. Canaani for the gift of the K562 cDNA library."

BiP is thought to recognize unfolded or unassembled polypeptides by binding extended sequences of approximately seven amino acids that include bulky hydrophobic residues not normally exposed on the surface of native proteins. We used a computer algorithm developed to predict BiP binding sites within protein primary sequences to identify sites within immunoglobulin chains that might mediate their association with BiP. Very few of the sequential heptapeptides in the heavy or light chain sequences were potential BiP binding sites. Analysis of the ability of synthetic heptapeptides corresponding to 24 potential sites in heavy chains to stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP indicated that at least half of them were authentic BiP binding sequences. These sequences were not confined to a single domain of the heavy chain but were distributed within both the VH and CH domains. Interestingly, when the BiP binding sequences were mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the Fd antibody fragment, the majority involve residues that participate in contact sites between the heavy and light chains. Therefore, we suggest that in vivo BiP chaperones the folding and assembly of antibody molecules by binding to hydrophobic surface regions on the isolated immunoglobulin chains that subsequently participate in interchain contacts.

Interestingly, BiP was independently identified as a protein (GRP78) expressed in response to glucose starvation (Pouyssegur et al., 1977). BiP is now known to associate transiently not only with immunoglobulin heavy and light chains during their folding and assembly (Bole et al., 1986; Hendershot et al., 1987; Nakaki et al., 1989; Dul and Argon, 1990, Ma et al., 1990; Knittler and Haas, 1992) but also with a wide variety of other newly synthesized wild-type exocytotic proteins (for reviews, see Gething and Sambrook(1992); Gething et al.(1994); Haas (1994)). BiP interacts more permanently with malfolded or unassembled proteins whose transport from the ER is blocked but does not bind to native proteins. These observations indicate that BiP plays a role in the folding and assembly of newly synthesized proteins in the ER lumen. Like other Hsp70 proteins, BiP is thought to function by recognizing hydrophobic sequences exposed on unfolded or unassembled polypeptides and, by inhibiting intra- or intermolecular aggregation, maintaining them in a state competent for subsequent folding and oligomerization (Gething and Sambrook, 1992; Craig et al., 1993; Becker and Craig, 1994; Hightower et al., 1994). immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein endoplasmic reticulum proteolytically derived antibody fragment consisting of the entire immunoglobulin light chain and the two amino-terminal domains of the heavy chain part of the immunoglobulin heavy chain consisting of the two amino-terminal domains (VH and CH1) part of the immunoglobulin heavy chain consisting of the two carboxyl-terminal domains (CH2 and CH3) murine antibody of the subclass κIgG1, directed against human creatine kinase human monoclonal antibody of the subclass κIgG1 from the cell line 3D6 directed against the gp41 protein of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 N-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl. Although the transient interaction between BiP and immunoglobulin molecules has been well documented, little is known about the location or nature of the sequences on the heavy and light chains that are recognized by the chaperone. Indirect evidence points to the CH1 domain of the heavy chain being required for association with BiP (Hendershot et al., 1987). Thus, whereas mutant heavy chains lacking CH2 or CH3 domains are complexed with BiP and remain in the ER, chains lacking CH1 do not appear to interact with BiP and are transported along the secretory pathway. Other studies indicate that sequences within the VH domain influence the association of heavy chains with BiP (Haas, 1991). To identify potential BiP binding sequences in Ig heavy chains, we took advantage of a computer scoring system designed to predict BiP binding sites in synthetic peptides and naturally occurring polypeptides (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a). We scored sequences from two different but related antibodies, MAK 33 and 3D6. Monoclonal antibody MAK 33 has been used in a number of studies on antibody folding in vitro (Buchner and Rudolph, 1991; Buchner et al., 1991; Lilie et al., 1995a, 1995b) and on the influence on this process of folding catalysts and chaperones (Wiech et al., 1992; Schmidt and Buchner, 1992; Schmidt et al., 1994; Lilie et al., 1993, 1994; Lilie and Buchner, 1995). Since the three-dimensional structure of this antibody is not yet known, we also scored the Fd portion of the monoclonal antibody 3D6, which three-dimensional structure had been determined to a resolution of 2.7 Å (He et al., 1992). We report that it is possible to predict potential BiP binding sites in the two different immunoglobulin sequences using the scoring procedure. Only a small number of potential BiP binding sites were identified, with the majority of the antibody sequences having a very low probability of binding to BiP. The potential binding sites in the Ig heavy chains are distributed within both the VH and CH domains, and the majority involve residues that participate in contact sites between the heavy and light chains. We suggest that BiP chaperones the folding and assembly of antibody molecules by binding to hydrophobic surface regions on the isolated immunoglobulin chains that subsequently participate in interchain contacts. BiP used in ATPase stimulation assays was isolated from bovine pancreas based on a procedure described previously (Wiech et al., 1993). All steps of the isolation were performed at 4°C. Bovine pancreas was homogenized, MgATP was added, and the homogenate was centrifuged twice to remove cell fragments, nuclei, and mitochondria. Subsequently, the microsomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. The post-microsomal supernatant contained a considerable amount of BiP, which could be separated from Hsc70 and Hsp90 by DE52 anion exchange chromatography with a linear NaCl gradient (100-200 mM). BiP-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 40 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 20 mM KOH, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.005% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.8 (buffer L). The resuspended rough microsomes were supplemented with NaCl and Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 100 mM and 0.1% (v/v), respectively. After homogenization, the membranes were removed by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 120 min. Subsequent DE52 anion exchange chromatography was performed as described previously (Wiech et al., 1993). The dialyzed pools of BiP were then applied to a C8 ATP-agarose column (Sigma). After washing the column with buffer L containing 10 mM EDTA, but no MgCl2, BiP was eluted with buffer L supplemented with 0.5 M KCl and 4 mM MgATP. The eluate was dialyzed against 40 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (buffer B), (NH4)2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 2 M, and the solution was then applied to a butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). BiP was released from the column by a linear gradient from 2 to 0 M (NH4)2SO4 (in buffer B). The fractions of pure BiP were concentrated and stored in buffer L containing 25% (v/v) glycerol at -70°C. ATPase assays were performed according to Kornberg et al.(1978). Approximately 4 μg of purified BiP were incubated at 37°C with 500 μM (final concentration) unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of [α-32P]ATP in a total volume of 20 μl containing 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, and 2 mM MgCl2. The stimulation of the ATPase activity by peptide was determined in the presence of concentrations of 10 μM to 1 mM of the respective peptide. Following different times of incubation, 3-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were added to 2 μl of a mixture of ATP, ADP, AMP, and EDTA (each 12 mM) to terminate the reaction. Thin layer chromatography was performed in 0.5 M LiCl and 2 N formic acid. The plates were dried, and the spots corresponding to ATP and ADP were located with UV light and excised; the radioactivity was then determined by liquid scintillation. The radioactivity in each spot was expressed as a fraction of the total recovered in each lane. Peptides were synthesized using a 9050 PepSynthesizer (Milligen) and Fmoc-protected amino acids (Atherton et al., 1978). The first residue was coupled to polystyrene beads via an acid-labile linker (Tenta-Gel, Rapp-Polymere). Double coupling cycles were used for residues following proline or glycine and when identical or similar residues were clustered, in order to avoid incomplete coupling reactions. t-Butyl (Ser, Thr, Tyr), t-butylester (Asp, Glu), trityl (Cys, His, Gln, Asn), t-butyloycarbonyl (Lys), and 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzene-sulfonyl (Arg) groups were used for side chain protection. Fmoc-protected amino acids were converted to hydroxy-benzotriazol-activated esters with 1.5 mmol of hydroxybenzotriazol and 1.2 mmol of diisopropycarbodiimide per mmol of amino acid, prior to the coupling procedure. The subsequent coupling reaction was performed in N,N-1-dimethylformamide, and coupling times of 10 min were used. Fmoc groups were removed by 20% piperidine, and the completeness of this reaction was monitored by fluorometric measurements (all amino acids were purchased from Bachem AG, solvents were from Merck AG, and chemicals were from Aldrich). After synthesis, side chain protecting groups were removed by treatment for 4 h in 50% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane or in 100% trifluoroacetic acid overnight when Arg residues were present in the peptide sequence. 3% anisol and 3% phenol was routinely added as scavengers including 5% 2-mercaptoethanol in cases where Arg and Trp residues were combined in the peptide sequence. Subsequently, solvents were evaporated, the peptide suspended in 1-2 ml acetic acid and precipitated in an excess of ice-cold t-butylethylether, washed several times, and suspended in water. The peptide was lyophilized and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C2/C18 copolymer column (PepS, Pharmacia) and a gradient of 0-70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Finally, the peptide-containing fractions were lyophilized. The sequences of the MAK33 and the 3D6 antibodies were screened for potential BiP binding sites using the BiP Score computer program (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a). The algorithm used in this program scores amino acid sequences with a moving window of seven residues, the apparent size of the (poly)peptide binding cleft on BiP (Flynn et al., 1991; Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a). An individual score is assigned to each amino acid depending on its position within the heptapeptide, and the sum of the seven scores provides a measure of the probability that a given heptapeptide would bind to BiP. Heptapeptides with scores greater than 10 are very likely to bind to BiP, while peptides with scores between +6 and +10 have odds of 3 to 1 of displaying binding activity. Scores from 0 to +5 have little predictive value, but peptides with negative scores almost invariably lack the capacity to bind to BiP. Fig. 1 shows the results of the scoring procedure for heavy chain sequences of the two antibodies. The scores range from -28 to +12 for heptapeptides contained in the 3D6 Fd fragment and from -31 to +20 for those from the MAK33 heavy chain (Fd + Fc). Only a small fraction of the heptapeptides (<8% for 3D6 sequences, <5% for MAK33 sequences) had scores greater than +6, indicating that they were potential sites for binding to BiP. The majority of these had scores in the range between +6 and +10 (14 out of 223 peptides in the case of 3D6, 18 out of 448 peptides in the case of MAK33) and should therefore bind to BiP with a probability of 3 to 1. Only a very few (3 in the case of 3D6 and 4 in the case of MAK33) had scores greater than +10, indicating a very high probability of binding. Peptides with positive scores were frequently clustered in small groups of 2-5 peptides but were distributed throughout the 3D6 Fd fragment and the MAK33 heavy chain, indicating no special preference for a distinct antibody domain. Very similar results were obtained when the light chains of the two antibodies were scored (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Prediction of BiP binding sequences in the primary structure of the light chains of antibodies 3D6 (A) and MAK33 (B). Overall scores for each of the overlapping heptapeptides in these sequences were calculated using the BiP Score program described by Blond-Elguindi et al. (1993a).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the predictive capacity of the BiP Score program, we checked the ability of synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted BiP binding sites in the Ig heavy chains to stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP (Flynn et al., 1989). 34 peptides were synthesized. 26 of these corresponded to sequences from the heavy chain of antibody 3D6 (named HD14-183), including 15 potential binding sites with scores ranging from +5 to +12, and 11 sites with scores ranging from +1 to -28, which are unlikely to be BiP binding sequences. A further 8 peptides corresponding to potential sites in the heavy chain of MAK33 (named HM27 to 430) had scores of +7 to +20. The peptide HD111R does not correspond to a natural 3D6 peptide but is a randomized version of peptide HD111 having the same amino acid composition but a different sequence and a significantly lower BiP Score (-6 versus +10). Most of the synthetic peptides were heptamers, but when the carboxyl-terminal residue of the chosen heptapeptide was proline or tryptophan, thus causing problems with synthesis, octapeptides that included the next residue in the sequence were synthesized (see peptides HD47/48, HD133/134, and HM387/388). In each case, these peptides contain two potential seven-residue binding sites, and the overall BiP score for the second heptapeptide is also provided in Table 1.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Table 1 presents the sequences and scores of the synthetic peptides together with the results of assays of their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP when added at a concentration of 500 μM. Of the 23 peptides having BiP scores of at least +5, 12 stimulated BiP ATPase activity by factors ranging from 1.9 to 3.8. These stimulation factors correspond well to those obtained in the same experiment for two peptides, pp28 and pp37, selected as BiP binding peptides by bacteriophage display (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a) and to those reported previously for other peptides tested at this concentration (Flynn et al., 1989; Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993b; Fourie et al., 1994). An additional two peptides displayed consistent but lower stimulatory capacity (1.4- and 1.6-fold, respectively). As “negative controls” we tested a set of 10 heptapeptides that had negative BiP scores and one peptide with a score of +1. All of these peptides failed to stimulate the ATPase activity of BiP (Table 1). The fact that peptide HD111 (score +10) displayed one of the highest stimulation factors (3.0) while its randomized version peptide 111R (score, -6) failed to stimulate BiP ATPase activity confirms that it is not the composition of amino acids that determines the ability of a peptide to bind to BiP but rather their specific sequence in the peptide. The concentration dependence of ATPase stimulation was measured for four peptides corresponding to sequences from the 3D6 heavy chain and for the previously characterized pp28 peptide. The data shown in Fig. 3 yielded a Km value of 60 ± 10 μM for peptide HD111, defined as the concentration of peptide required for half-maximal stimulation of the ATPase activity of BiP. As shown in Table 2, peptides HD131, HD133, and HD177 caused half-maximal stimulation at even lower concentrations (6-17 μM), while the Km obtained for peptide pp28 was 16 ± 3 μM, which is in good agreement with the value of 10 ± 2 μM obtained previously (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a).TABLE II Open table in a new tab Finally, the capacity of peptide HD111 to bind to BiP was tested using the ability of the peptide to compete the binding of BiP to reduced and carboxymethylated lactalbumin as described previously (Fourie et al., 1994). Competition of reduced and carboxymethylated lactalbumin binding was approximately 30-40% at a peptide concentration of 50 μM, while 100 μM peptide caused approximately 70-80% competition. Extrapolation of this data suggests that half-maximal competition of binding would be achieved at 60-70 μM, a value in excellent agreement with the Km value measured for ATPase stimulation (data not shown). Finally we investigated the position in the three-dimensional structure of 3D6 of the BiP binding sequences that we had identified as causing significant stimulation of the ATPase activity of BiP. Fig. 4 shows the VH and CH1 sequences of antibody 3D6, with the 10 peptides that were predicted and shown to be positive with respect to BiP binding outlined by frames. The residues of 3D6 involved in the interface between the H-chain and the L-chain (shown by shaded boxes) were determined by comparing the surface exposure of side chains in the crystal structure of the dimer and the artifically separated monomers. With only two exceptions (HD14 and HD167), the BiP binding sequences contain multiple residues that participate in the contact sites. In total, of 48 contact residues 25 are located within BiP binding sequences. These 25 residues include the majority of the contact site residues that are hydrophobic in character. These observations suggest that binding of BiP to one or more of several potential binding sites exposed within the contact interface on folded but unassembled heavy chains would shield the hydrophobic surfaces and inhibit unproductive aggregation reactions. Using a computer program that predicts recognition sites within protein sequences for binding of the ER-located chaperone BiP (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a), we identified a number of potential BiP binding sites in the primary sequences of antibodies 3D6 and MAK33. Only a small proportion of all the sequential heptapeptides within the immunoglobulin sequences are potential BiP binders (i.e. have BiP Scores ≥+5). Measurement of the ability of synthetic peptides corresponding to 23 potential sites in the immunoglobulin heavy chains to stimulate the ATPase activity of purified BiP demonstrated that 12 of them were indeed BiP binding sequences. Our results confirm that the predictive power of the scoring program is greater than 50% for positive peptides, rising to ~80% when peptides with BiP scores ≥10 are considered, and it is close to 100% for negative peptides. Analysis of the concentration dependence of stimulation of BiP by a subset of the peptides yielded apparent Km values of 6-60 μM that lie within the range previously defined for high affinity sites (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993a; Fourie et al., 1994). Confirmed BiP binding sequences are located within both the VH and CH1 domains of the 3D6 heavy chain and within the CH3 domain of the MAK33 heavy chain. In addition, a number of untested sequences having BiP scores >10 (and therefore having a high probability of being BiP binding sites) are present in the MAK33 CH2 domain. Thus, potential BiP binding sites are not confined to the CH1 domain of the heavy chain, as was previously suggested on the basis of experiments that showed that mutant heavy chains lacking CH1 do not interact stably with BiP (Hendershot et al., 1987). Rather our data are consistent with the recent results of Kaloff and Haas(1995), who showed that the CH1 domain is not the only portion of the heavy chain that interacts with BiP during the biosynthesis and initial folding of the molecule. What apparently sets the CH1 domain apart from the other three domains of the heavy chain is its propensity to continue to expose at least one BiP binding site after the heavy chain dimer is formed, and this is probably the result of the CH1 domain being uniquely unable to homodimerize. Fig. 5 presents a schematic model of the role of BiP during the folding and assembly of immunoglobulin molecules. During the translocation of heavy and light chains as extended polypeptides into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, BiP binds to one or more of multiple potential sites present within all four domains of the heavy chains and within both domains of the light chains. Some potential binding sites become occluded as the domains begin to fold, but sites displayed on surfaces destined to become subunit interfaces remain exposed until assembly occurs, first of heavy or light chain homodimers and then of the H2L2 heterotetramers. Our data suggest that BiP binding sites in immunoglobulins may in fact be concentrated in sequences that participate in subunit interfaces. The localization within the three-dimensional structure of antibody 3D6 of confirmed potential binding sites in the Fd portion of the heavy chain showed that almost every site includes amino acids that are part of the contact surface between the heavy and light chains. Furthermore, the hydrophobic residues that are destined to become buried in the interface are disproportionately present within the potential BiP binding sites. By protecting hydrophobic patches on the surface of Ig folding intermediates from forming inappropriate interactions with other partially folded polypeptides, nonspecific aggregation and unproductive side reactions would be suppressed, and the generation of correctly assembled antibodies would be favored. It will be of great interest to determine if BiP binding sites in other multisubunit proteins are also preferentially localized in sequences that form subunit interfaces, thus indicating a general and important role for BiP during subunit assembly. We thank Martina Hilbert for identifying residues involved in interchain contacts by analysis of the crystal structure of the 3D6 antibody, Ursula Jakob for performing initial experiments on the ATPase activity of BiP, Lydia Nanu for performing the reduced and carboxymethylated lactalbumin competition assay, and Astrid Brunner for assistance during peptide synthesis.

In contrast to other nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, which have been characterized as soluble homodimeric enzymes, ecNOS is predominantly membrane-associated, a feature that has hindered direct biochemical analyses of its oligomeric structure. We investigated ecNOS oligomerization using co-immunoprecipitation experiments in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. When COS-7 cells co-transfected with constructs encoding wild-type ecNOS and an epitope-tagged myristoylation-deficient mutant were biosynthetically labeled with [3H]myristate, the antibody to the epitope tag specifically immunoprecipitated 3H-labeled ecNOS, reflecting enzyme oligomerization. In COS-7 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding epitope-tagged truncation mutants and untagged full-length ecNOS, the wild-type enzyme could be immunoprecipitated by the antibody to the epitope tag. Co-immunoprecipitation of ecNOS with truncation mutants documented that both N- and C-terminal domains are involved in ecNOS oligomerization. When these truncation mutants are co-expressed with wild-type ecNOS, they exert a marked dominant negative effect on enzyme activity. Since NOS oligomerization itself may be subject to dynamic modulation, the regulation of ecNOS assembly may have implications for NO signaling in the vascular wall.

Nitric oxide, a ubiquitous messenger molecule, is synthesized by a family of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) 1The abbreviations used are: NOSnitric oxide synthaseNOnitric oxideecNOS, iNOS, nNOSendothelial, inducible and neuronal isoforms (respectively) of nitric oxide synthasemyr- ecNOSmyristoylation-deficient mutant of ecNOSHAinfluenza hemagglutinin epitopePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and participates in diverse cellular processes, including neurotransmission, immune regulation, and vascular homeostasis(1Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 705-707Google Scholar). Three distinct NOS isoforms have been identified: neuronal (nNOS), inducible (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (ecNOS). These NOS isoforms subserve disparate physiological roles and differ markedly in their tissue distribution and mechanisms of regulation (see (2Stuehr D.J. Griffith O.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 287-346Google Scholar, 3Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Google Scholar, 4Marletta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Google Scholar) for review). Nevertheless, the NOS isoforms appear to share many biochemical features, including common cofactor and substrate requirements. All known NOS isoforms catalyze the calmodulin-dependent oxidation of L-arginine to form nitric oxide plus L-citrulline. Recently, it was shown that dimerization of iNOS is required for catalytic activity(5Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2120-2129Google Scholar); the active nNOS is also a homodimer(6Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Google Scholar).

Oligomerization may serve as an important mechanism both for enzyme regulation and for signal transduction(7Austin A.J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1994; 1: 131-136Google Scholar, 8Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Google Scholar). Dimerization of iNOS appears to depend on the presence of the enzyme cofactors tetrahydrobiopterin and heme, as well as the substrate L-arginine(5Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2120-2129Google Scholar). The nNOS homodimer is also stabilized by tetrahydrobiopterin and L-arginine (6Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Google Scholar). Since cellular levels of cofactors and substrate may themselves be regulated, enzyme oligomerization may provide a mechanism for modulation of NOS activity. In contrast to the other NOS isoforms, which can be studied as soluble dimeric enzymes, ecNOS is predominantly membrane-associated(9Pollock J.S. Forstermann U. Mitchell J.A. Warner T.D. Schmidt H.W. Nakane M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10480-10484Google Scholar), a feature that has hampered direct hydrodynamic analyses of its oligomeric structure. In the present study, we use co-immunoprecipitation experiments to show that ecNOS is an oligomeric protein and that both N- and C-terminal domains of the enzyme appear to be involved in its assembly. Furthermore, these studies document that co-expression of ecNOS truncation mutants with the wild-type enzyme exerts a dominant negative effect on enzyme activity. Constructs encoding wild-type ecNOS or the myristoylation-deficient mutant (myr-), as well as their hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged counterparts, have previously been described(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Google Scholar, 11Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Google Scholar). To prepare epitope-tagged truncation mutants, the sequence for the HA epitope followed by a stop codon was first subcloned into the pBK-CMV expression vector to form pk-HA(11Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Google Scholar). Truncation mutants of ecNOS lacking either the N- or C-terminal domains were then created using propitious restriction enzyme sites within the ecNOS sequence; these constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 1. To delete the C terminus, the ecNOS cDNA was digested with EcoRI and KpnI, yielding a fragment that contains the first 2226 base pairs and encodes the N-terminal 736 amino acids (residues 1-736). This fragment was subcloned into pK-HA in frame with the epitope tag. The resulting construct, pΔKpn, is predicted to yield a protein of Mr = 82 kDa. To delete the N-terminal half of the protein, the plasmid encoding epitope-tagged ecNOS was digested with BglII and BamHI to remove the 5′ 1536 bases of the ecNOS cDNA. The restricted plasmid was ligated and cloned to yield the construct pKCT encoding the C-terminal 694 amino acids of ecNOS. The first methionine codon within this truncated construct (methionine 512 in ecNOS) lies within a sequence favorable for translation initiation and would direct the expression of the C-terminal ~1/2 of ecNOS plus the HA epitope. Expression of pKCT is predicted to yield a protein of Mr = 77.6 kDa. COS-7 cells were maintained and transfected in 100-mm cell culture dishes (using the DEAE-dextran method) as described previously(12Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Google Scholar). Biosynthetic labeling of transfected cells with [3H]myristic acid (Amersham Corp.) or [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, ICN) was performed exactly as before(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Google Scholar, 13Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Google Scholar). In transfected cells, NO synthase activity was assayed in cell lysates by measuring the conversion of L-[3H]arginine to L-[3H]citrulline, as described previously(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Google Scholar, 12Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Google Scholar). NADPH diaphorase activity was determined by staining of fixed cells, as before(12Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were harvested by scraping in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended and sonicated in a hypotonic buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml each of soybean trypsin inhibitor, lima bean trypsin inhibitor, leupeptin, and antipain) to yield the cell lysate. Immunoprecipitation conditions were modified from those previously described(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Google Scholar, 11Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Google Scholar, 13Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Google Scholar). A non-denaturing detergent was used to solubilize the enzyme to better preserve the native structure of ecNOS. The cell lysates were diluted in 4 volumes of CHAPS buffer containing 20 mM CHAPS (Sigma), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 125 mM NaCl, 4 μM tetrahydrobiopterin (Schircks Laboratories), 1 mML-arginine, and protease inhibitors as above. Duplicate aliquots of cell lysates were incubated either with a previously characterized (10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Google Scholar) antipeptide antiserum raised against ecNOS, at a final dilution of 1:100, or with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody for the HA epitope tag (Boehringer Mannheim), at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. After 1 h at 4°C, protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were added to the samples. After a further incubation for 1 h at 4°C, bound immune complexes were washed three times with CHAPS buffer and then once with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) supplemented with 4 μM tetrahydrobiopterin and 1 mML-arginine. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography (En3Hance, DuPont NEN). The gels were exposed to x-ray film at -70°C using intensifying screens. To explore whether ecNOS forms oligomers, we constructed cDNAs encoding several epitope-tagged ecNOS mutants (Fig. 1) and investigated the association of mutant and wild-type proteins by co-immunoprecipitation from transfected cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs for wild-type ecNOS or an epitope-tagged myristoylation-deficient mutant (myr-) and biosynthetically labeled with [3H]myristic acid (Fig. 2). Duplicate samples of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either the anti-ecNOS antibody or the antibody to the epitope tag. As previously observed, the point mutation in the myr- mutant prevents the incorporation of myristate(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Google Scholar); thus, no labeled protein is specifically immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with this construct alone (Fig. 2). Wild-type ecNOS is labeled with [3H]myristate, as previously observed(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Google Scholar), and when expressed alone is immunoprecipitated by the anti-ecNOS antibody but not the antibody to the HA epitope (Fig. 2). However, when untagged ecNOS is co-transfected with the HA-tagged myr- mutant, a [3H]myristate-labeled protein corresponding to ecNOS is immunoprecipitated by the HA antibody. This finding documents that the wild-type ecNOS associates with the tagged myr- mutant and thereby demonstrates that ecNOS is an oligomeric enzyme. Furthermore, since the myr- mutant undergoes neither myristoylation nor palmitoylation (11Robinson L.J. Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 995-998Google Scholar) and is exclusively cytosolic(10Busconi L. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8410-8413Google Scholar), it appears that oligomerization of ecNOS requires neither membrane association nor acylation. Our demonstration that ecNOS, like the iNOS and nNOS isoforms, is an oligomeric protein raises the possibility that it may form heteromeric complexes with these other isoforms. In cells able to express multiple isoforms of NOS, such as cardiac myocytes(14Balligand J.-L. Kobzik L. Han X. Kaye D.M. Belhassen L. O'Hara D.S. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14582-14586Google Scholar), hetero-oligomerization could provide an additional mechanism for regulating NO synthesis. Having observed that ecNOS can form oligomers, we wished to define the regions of the protein involved in subunit association. The NO synthases appear to be composed of two structurally and functionally distinct domains(1Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 705-707Google Scholar, 15Richards M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Google Scholar, 16McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Google Scholar, 17Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar). The C-terminal or “reductase” domain shows striking sequence similarity to cytochrome P-450 reductase and contains consensus binding sequences for flavins and NADPH(18Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of NOS has been termed the “heme domain” and includes the proximal thiolate heme ligand and the likely site for tetrahydrobiopterin binding(15Richards M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Google Scholar, 16McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Google Scholar, 17Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Google Scholar, 19Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar). We constructed two epitope-tagged truncation mutants of ecNOS: pKCT, encoding the C-terminal reductase domain, and pΔKpn, containing the N-terminal heme domain (Fig. 1). The pKCT mutant was strongly positive in the NADPH diaphorase assay, consistent with preservation of the reductase function of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3). By contrast, the pΔKpn mutant was negative in the NADPH diaphorase assay, likely reflecting the absence of essential redox cofactor binding sites in this construct. Neither truncation mutant supported NO synthesis (see below). We investigated which domains are involved in ecNOS oligomerization by co-expression and immunoprecipitation of wild-type ecNOS with these epitope-tagged truncation mutants. As shown in Fig. 4, the protein encoded by the pΔKpn truncation mutant can be expressed in COS cells and is immunoprecipitated with either the ecNOS antibody or the antibody to the epitope tag. Wild-type ecNOS, when expressed alone, can be immunoprecipitated only by the ecNOS antibody. However, when wild-type ecNOS is co-expressed with the epitope-tagged mutant, the full-length enzyme is now immunoprecipitated by the HA antibody (Fig. 4). This suggests that the full-length protein associates with the tagged truncation mutant in a hetero-oligomeric complex. When lysates of cells transfected separately with ecNOS or pΔKpn were combined in vitro, ecNOS did not co-immunoprecipitate with the truncation mutant (Fig. 4). This result implies that the observed association of co-expressed full-length and truncated ecNOS primarily occurs intracellularly and not following cell lysis. A similar approach was employed to examine the role of the C-terminal domain in enzyme oligomerization. COS-7 cells were transfected with constructs for wild-type ecNOS or the HA-tagged truncation mutant, pKCT (Fig. 5); as before, when expressed alone, the untagged wild-type enzyme was immunoprecipitated by the ecNOS antibody but not by the antibody to the epitope tag. Epitope-tagged pKCT could be immunoprecipitated by either antibody. When the wild-type enzyme was co-expressed with pKCT, full-length ecNOS could now be immunoprecipitated by the HA antibody, consistent with the formation of a hetero-oligomeric complex. Together these results suggest that both the N- and C-terminal domains of ecNOS may be involved in oligomerization of the enzyme. These findings may be contrasted with a recent study of iNOS oligomerization by Ghosh and Stuehr(19Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar). In this report, limited tryptic digestion of purified iNOS (which cleaves in midmolecule to separate N- and C-terminal domains) led to the formation of dimeric N-terminal and monomeric C-terminal peptides. Therefore, it was proposed for iNOS that only the N-terminal domain, and not the C-terminal domain, participates in dimer formation. However, our results document specific interactions between the full-length enzyme and both the N- and C-terminal domains, since the N- and C-terminal truncation mutants are each able to co-immunoprecipitate ecNOS. These divergent results may represent intrinsic differences between iNOS and ecNOS oligomerization or may reflect differences in experimental approach. Both the N- and C-terminal ecNOS truncation mutants thus appear to form hetero-oligomeric complexes with the wild-type enzyme. However, only a fraction of the wild-type ecNOS is co-immunoprecipitated by these truncation mutants (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). It is possible that stronger associations between full-length ecNOS monomers result in preferential formation of homo-oligomers of the wild-type enzyme. Indeed, when ecNOS is expressed with the full-length HA-tagged myr- mutant, a larger fraction of the wild-type enzyme is co-immunoprecipitated by the HA antibody (Fig. 2). Weaker interactions between truncation mutants and full-length ecNOS might also lead to a substantial dissociation of hetero-oligomeric complexes during immunoprecipitation, with consequent loss of the full-length enzyme. To examine the effects of hetero-oligomerization on NOS enzyme activity, we measured the conversion of L-[3H]arginine to L-[3H]citrulline in lysates of cells transfected with ecNOS and either the C- or N-terminal truncation mutants. Essentially no NOS activity was seen in sham-transfected COS cells or in cells expressing only the pΔKpn (Fig. 6A) or pKCT (Fig. 6B) truncation mutants. Transfection of wild-type ecNOS cDNA resulted in substantial NOS enzyme activity, but when either truncation mutant was co-expressed, enzyme activity was diminished, documenting a dominant negative effect of these mutants. Furthermore, the attenuation in NOS activity increased as the amount of the co-transfected mutant cDNA was increased (total DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of vector DNA). The degree of inhibition observed with co-transfection could not be reproduced by combining wild-type and mutant ecNOS in vitro (Fig. 6), conditions under which no hetero-oligomerization could be detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4). The dominant negative effects of ecNOS truncation mutants may thus reflect the intracellular formation of inactive hetero-oligomers. Dimerization has been shown to be necessary for the catalytic activity of other isoforms of NOS and may be modulated by levels of substrates and cofactors(5Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2120-2129Google Scholar, 6Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bächinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Google Scholar). It seems likely that ecNOS oligomerization is also required for catalysis, most plausibly involving formation of an intact ecNOS homodimer. The dominant negative effects of ecNOS truncation mutants may reflect their competition with full-length monomers for the same sites of association. These results also suggest that intersubunit interactions are involved in the complex redox pathway from arginine to citrulline plus NO. These speculations will be refined by studies of the structural features of hetero-oligomeric ecNOS complexes; such studies are likely to provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying the dominant negative effect of the truncation mutants. Characterization of the regions involved in NOS dimerization may lead to the identification of a new class of enzyme inhibitors that exert a dominant negative effect on NOS activity by inhibiting enzyme oligomerization. We are grateful to Dr. Kazuhiro Sase for helpful discussions."

All the expressed receptors underwent homologous phosphorylation and desensitization upon agonist stimulation. When co-expressed, epitope-tagged C5a receptor (ET-C5aR) and epitope-tagged IL-8 receptor (ET-IL-8RA) were cross-phosphorylated by activation of the other. Activation of epitope-tagged fMLP receptor (ET-FR) also cross-phosphorylated ET-C5aR and ET-IL-8RA, but ET-FR was totally resistant to cross-phosphorylation. Similarly, C5a and IL-8 stimulation of [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding and Ca2+ mobilization were cross-desensitized by each other and by fMLP. Stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding by fMLP was also not cross-desensitized by C5a or IL-8, however, Ca2+ mobilization was, suggesting a site of inhibition distal to G protein activation. Consistent with this desensitization of Ca2+ mobilization, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate release in RBL-2H3 cells expressing both ET-C5aR and ET-FR revealed that fMLP and C5a cross-desensitized each other's ability to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Taken together, these results indicate that receptor cross-phosphorylation correlates directly with desensitization at the level of G protein activation. The ET-FR was resistant to this process. Of note, cross-desensitization of ET-FR at the level of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization was demonstrated in the absence of receptor phosphorylation.

In order to characterize the cellular location of the expressed receptor mutants, a highly specific, high affinity antipeptide antibody was prepared against the extracellular, N-terminal tail of the receptor.

Membranes from cells expressing receptor mutants lacking a large portion of the N-terminal tail or any of the seven putative transmembrane segments failed to bind glucagon.

https://openalex.org/W2011192337,"The ST2/T1 receptor, a homologue of the interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R), was expressed in COS and Drosophila S2 cells as a human IgG-Fc fusion protein. While a type I IL-1RFc fusion protein bound human IL-1 in vitro, the ST2Fc fusion protein did not. Furthermore, IL-1 stimulated a synthetic interleukin-8 promoter reporter gene that was cotransfected into Jurkat cells with a full-length IL-1R type I (IL-1R1) or a chimeric receptor composed of the IL-1RI extracellular domain and ST2 intracellular domain. In contrast, IL-1 did not stimulate the interleukin-8 promoter when cotransfected with a full-length ST2 or an ST2 extracellular/IL-1R intracellular domain fusion protein. Both IL-1RI and the IL-1R/ST2R chimeric receptor also activated a receptor-associated kinase and CSBP/p38 MAP kinase. Using ST2Fc receptor, we have identified, through receptor precipitation, receptor-dot blot and surface plasmon resonance, a putative ligand of ST2 secreted from Balb/c 3T3 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The putative ligand was also able to stimulate CSBP/p38 MAP kinase through the ST2 receptor. These results suggest that the ST2 is not an IL-1 receptor but rather has its own cognate ligand."

Neuronal NOS (nNOS) and endothelial NOS are constitutive, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent isoforms that, when activated, produce NO in low (i.e. nanomolar) concentrations as part of signal transduction pathways involved in neurotransmission (4Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Google Scholar) and blood pressure regulation(5Aisaka K. Gross S.S. Griffith O.W. Levi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A distinct NOS isoform, not regulated by changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels, is expressed in many cell types in response to inflammatory cytokines. Nitric oxide produced by this isoform can reach levels (10-100 μM) that are disruptive to processes normally controlled by endothelial NOS or nNOS. Such levels are also potentially toxic to inducible NOS-containing cells and adjacent cells as well as to viruses and microbial pathogens within those cells(7Nathan C.F. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1991; 3: 65-70Google Scholar, 8Nathan C. Xie Q. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Google Scholar). nitric oxide synthase neuronal NOS Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine electron paramagnetic resonance. The overall NOS reaction proceeds via two mono-oxygenations; the first forms Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOH-Arg) from L-arginine, and the second converts that tightly bound intermediate to citrulline and NO(9Stuehr D.J. Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Griffith O.W. Feldman P.L. Wiseman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6259-6263Google Scholar). Both mono-oxygenations are reminiscent of reactions catalyzed by the cytochrome P-450 system. Consistent with this view, all NOS isoforms contain a C-terminal reductase domain having significant (~39%) sequence homology to cytochrome P-450 reductase; putative binding sites for NADPH as well as for FAD and FMN, tightly bound cofactors, are identified in this domain(3Sessa W.C. J. Vasc. Res. 1994; 31: 131-143Google Scholar, 10Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1991; 351: 714-718Google Scholar). The NOS N-terminal oxygenase domain shows little or no sequence homology to known cytochrome P-450 but does contain a heme cofactor binding site in which a cysteine residue is positioned to act as a fifth axial ligand in cytochrome P-450-like fashion(11McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Google Scholar, 12Renard J.P. Boucher J.L. Vadon S. Delaforge M. Mansuy D. Biochem.

Recent studies with the isolated oxygenase domain establish that this region also contains binding sites for substrate L-arginine in addition to tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor of poorly characterized function(14Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Google Scholar, 15Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 801-807Google Scholar, 16McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Google Scholar). The oxygenase and reductase domains are connected by a calmodulin-binding region(10Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1991; 351: 714-718Google Scholar). For nNOS and endothelial NOS, binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to this region activates electron transfer between the reductase and oxygenase domains and allows electron flow from NADPH, through the flavins, to the heme cofactor(17Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10769-10772Google Scholar). Dioxygen can then be bound to and activated by the heme cofactor, and a guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine is oxidized first to NOH-Arg and then to NO. In inducible NOS, calmodulin is tightly and permanently bound, and the enzyme is fully active at basal Ca2+ levels(18Cho H.J. Xie Q. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Google Scholar). Detailed chemical mechanisms for the NOS reaction have been proposed (1Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev.

Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Google Scholar)). Central to all of the proposed schemes is the close physical approximation of heme iron and the reactive guanidino nitrogen of substrate L-arginine. In previous studies, we have probed possible interactions between these groups using substrate and inhibitor perturbation optical difference spectroscopy(23McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Google Scholar, 24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the heme ferric iron to further elucidate the degree and nature of heme and heme pocket interaction with the substrate, L-arginine, and with the putative heme-binding inhibitory citrulline analog, L-thiocitrulline. EPR spectra of the ferriheme and flavosemiquinone groups of native NOS have previously been reported by Stuehr and Ikeda-Saito(25Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Google Scholar). L-Thiocitrulline (γ-thioureido-L-norvaline) and L-homothiocitrulline (ɛ-thioureido-L-norleucine) were prepared as described previously(26Narayanan K. Griffith O.W. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 885-887Google Scholar). Other biochemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. Rat nNOS was purified from stably transfected kidney 293 cells essentially as described previously (23McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Google Scholar). A modification of the reported method was made in that enzyme was eluted from the 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose using 2′-AMP instead of NADPH (5 mM 2′-AMP, 0.4 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris•HCl buffer, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5). Purified enzyme was obtained in 50 mM Tris•HCl buffer, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5. Enzyme preparations exhibited specific activities of ~400 nmol/min/mg when assayed by measuring the conversion of L-[3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline as described previously (23McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Google Scholar). Enzyme samples were incubated with arginine or inhibitors at 0°C in a final volume of 0.25 ml. After 5 min, enzyme samples were flash-frozen in quartz EPR tubes (using 1:1 isopentane:cyclohexane cooled with liquid nitrogen) and were held in liquid nitrogen prior to spectroscopic measurements. Enzyme concentrations are expressed on the basis of heme concentration. Spectra were obtained using a Bruker 300 EPR spectrometer and an Oxford liquid helium cryostat. The addition of substrate or inhibitor resulted in <2% change in sample volume. Spectra were acquired at 9.445 GHz using the following instrument parameters: microwave power, 20 mW; modulation frequency, 100 KHz; and modulation amplitude, 14.3 G. For a high spin ferriheme species, the two numerically largest principle values of the g tensor correspond to orthogonal directions in the heme plane and are designated gx and gy by convention; gz corresponds to molecules with the heme normal along the laboratory magnetic field direction. The positions of gx and gy features are primarily determined by E/D, the ratio of the rhombic and axial zero field splitting parameters associated with the high spin state (see “Discussion”)(27Eisenberger P. Pershans P.S.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1966; 45: 2832-2835Google Scholar, 28Slappendel S. Veldink G.A. Vleigenthart J.F.G. Aasa R. Malmstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 667: 77-86Google Scholar). The low spin features associated with Zeeman field orientation in the heme plane are the two numerically smallest values and correspond to gx and gy; the largest value of g lies approximately along the heme normal. The positions of these features depend directly on the relative energies of the iron t2gd orbitals (29Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Adler A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 206: 310-327Google Scholar, 30Bohan T. J. Magn. Reson. 1977; 26: 109-118Google Scholar, 31Taylor C.P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 491: 137-149Google Scholar). Simulations of EPR spectra for quantitation were performed using previously described programs(32Salerno J.C. Lim J. King T.E. Blum H. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4828-4835Google Scholar). Double integration of high spin spectra used the intensity factor of Aasa and Vaangard(33Aasa R. Vaangard T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). Ligand field splittings of low spin ferrihemes were calculated from g tensors as described by Peisach et al.(29Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Adler A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 206: 310-327Google Scholar). As isolated, nNOS contains primarily high spin heme (23McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Google Scholar). Binding of L-arginine to nNOS causes small changes in the Soret region of the optical spectrum consistent with conversion of the 10-15% of enzyme that is initially low spin to the high spin state(23McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Google Scholar). Because the optical spectral perturbations mainly reflect changes in spin state equilibrium and are insensitive to small changes in heme iron ligand field geometry, further studies were carried out using EPR spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures. With this technique, the spectral contributions of high and low spin iron can be more definitively resolved, and the identity and orientation of heme iron ligands can be inferred. Fig. 1(line B) shows the X-band EPR spectrum at 11°K of nNOS as isolated. Both the high and low spin components of the heme spin state equilibrium are visible and are completely resolved. Features from the high spin state of the ferric heme are visible near g = 7.65, 4.04, and 1.89. The g = 4.04 feature is overlapped with the g = 4.3 signal from the middle Kramer's doublet of adventitious rhombic high spin ferric iron. Because of the high transition probability and nearly isotropic nature of this species, this intense feature represents only a small concentration of contaminating iron in the enzyme preparation or buffer. Partly saturated signals from the low spin state of native nNOS can be observed near g = 2.43, 2.28, and 1.89; the sharp signal at g = 2 is contributed by a flavin radical, probably FMNH•(25Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20547-20550Google Scholar). The broad signal near g = 2 is contributed by impurities in the cavity and Dewar assembly. Addition of L-arginine to nNOS alters the spin state equilibrium in favor of the high spin form; no low spin form remains detectable either at 11°K (Fig. 1, line A) or at 21°K (not shown). The amplitude of the low field peak of the high spin form (g = 7.56) increases by ~15% following L-arginine addition. Integration of this slightly narrowed peak indicates that the high spin fraction has increased by 10-12%, indicating that the high spin/low spin ratio for nNOS in the absence of L-arginine is ~90/10. A similar conclusion has been reached through simulation studies comparing the high spin component of nNOS measured without L-arginine and the 100% low spin EPR signal seen when nNOS is saturated with imidazole, a heme-binding ligand. 2J. C. Salerno, K. McMillan, and B. S. S. Masters, unpublished observations. The temperature dependence of the EPR signals could be fit by Curie Law behavior for the low spin features up to 40°K, where signal to noise problems became significant. For high spin signals, an additional term representing the distribution within the S = 5/2 sextet with D = ~3.8 cm-1 produced a good fit. Although future studies might provide a more accurate measurement of D, the current result indicates that there is no temperature dependence in the spin state equilibrium below 25°K. It is apparent from results shown in Fig. 1 that the high spin species observed in the presence and absence of L-arginine are similar but not identical. In Fig. 2, the region between 0.07 and 0.21 tesla is displayed for the purpose of more detailed comparison. The calculated g values of the high spin features of the enzyme as isolated are 7.65 and 4.04 (line B); the latter g value is difficult to measure precisely due to the overlap with the rhombic ferric iron contaminant. The small shoulder on the high field side of the g = 7.65 peak suggests that the enzyme as isolated also contains a minority high spin species. In the presence of L-arginine, the corresponding high spin g values are 7.56 and 4.09 (line A). The narrowing of the EPR signals on L-arginine binding is even more pronounced in the g = 4 region than near g = 7.6. Note also that comparison of line A and line B shows that virtually none (<10%) of the original high spin species remains after addition of L-arginine, a finding indicating complete conversion of the original high and low spin species to a distinct high spin enzyme-arginine complex (i.e.L-arginine binds to both the low and high spin forms of nNOS). Fig. 2(line A-B) shows the difference spectrum of the L-arginine-saturated enzyme versus the enzyme as isolated. The orientation of the sigmoidal feature at g = 7.7 confirms the upfield shift of the low field peak in response to L-arginine binding. The larger size of the positive upfield lobe is due to the increase in the percentage of high spin heme noted earlier. The complex form of the difference spectrum near g = 4 is due to the sharpening of this feature by L-arginine as it shifts downfield. The central positive and negative lobes are contributed primarily by the sharp gy feature of the L-arginine-saturated enzyme. The broad positive lobe on the high field side (extending downfield from g = 4) is contributed by the enzyme as isolated. L-Thiocitrulline is a potent inhibitor of nNOS (Ki = 0.06 μM) that elicits a “type II-like” ligand perturbation optical difference spectrum when added to the enzyme(24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K.

Although optical spectroscopy studies show L-thiocitrulline causes only a small shift toward low spin enzyme when added to native nNOS, other data indicate that all or nearly all of the enzyme binds L-thiocitrulline (e.g. the exclusively low spin nNOS-imidazole complex undergoes a large type I spectral change when L-thiocitrulline is added)(24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar). The spin state equilibria of the nNOS-thiocitrulline complex and the interaction of L-thiocitrulline with ferriheme were more directly and completely elucidated by EPR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3(line A) nNOS in the presence of a saturating concentration of L-thiocitrulline exhibits a complex high spin ferriheme spectrum; for comparison, line C of Fig. 3 reproduces from Fig. 2 the EPR spectrum for nNOS as isolated. The low field peak has a g value of ~7.70; this is a significant shift downfield from the position of the peak in untreated enzyme. Note that the L-thiocitrulline-induced shift is in the opposite direction from the shift produced by L-arginine binding. As in the untreated sample, a shoulder on the high field side of this peak in the L-thiocitrulline-treated sample represents a distinct minority high spin component, in this case with a g value of 7.33. The high spin features of the nNOS-thiocitrulline complex in the g = 4 region are more complex. Two components of approximately equal amplitude can be resolved at g values of about 3.98 and 3.83. Neither of these features is associated with the species responsible for the minority line at g = 7.33; the amplitudes are mismatched, and the position of the peaks in the g = 4 region is inappropriate (see “Discussion”). They must therefore be the gy features of two high spin components, which are unresolved at gx = 7.7. The difference spectrum for L-thiocitrulline binding is shown as line A-C in Fig. 3. The relative positions of the positive and negative lobes illustrate that the general effect of L-thiocitrulline binding is an increase in the rhombicity of the high spin state. The low spin state species associated with nNOS as isolated and nNOS in the presence of L-thiocitrulline are compared in Fig. 4. Whereas the native enzyme shows a low spin species with features at 2.43, 2.28, and 1.89 (line B), the nNOS-thiocitrulline complex shows two new low spin species with principal g values of 2.47, 2.27, and 1.89, and 2.39, 2.27, and 1.90 (line A). Assignment of the last g value in each set was made on the basis of crystal field theory; the assignment given produced an orbital reduction factor closer to 1 for both species than the reverse assignment. It is notable that the percentage of ferriheme in the high spin state in the presence of L-thiocitrulline as measured by EPR at 11°K increases slightly in comparison with the enzyme as isolated. This can be appreciated from the decrease in the low spin signals shown in Fig. 4 and also from the slight increase in the high spin signals seen following L-thiocitrulline binding in Fig. 3(compare line A with line C or note the relatively larger size of the positive lobes in the difference spectrum, line A-C). This finding is in contrast to the increase in low spin form following L-thiocitrulline binding at room temperature deduced from changes in the optical spectrum in the Soret region (24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar) and is reminiscent of other temperature-sensitive spin state equilibria (34Vaangard T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 619-622Google Scholar). L-Homothiocitrulline is a NOS inhibitor with a Ki 12-50 times higher than that of L-thiocitrulline(24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar). It elicits a type I change in the optical spectrum of nNOS at room temperature, indicative of a shift in the spin state equilibrium toward high spin. Line B of Fig. 3 shows the EPR spectrum at 11°K of nNOS saturated with L-homothiocitrulline; this spectrum can be compared with line C, the spectrum of nNOS as isolated. With L-homothiocitrulline bound, the dominant low field peak (g = 7.75) is similar but not identical to the corresponding feature seen in the presence of L-thiocitrulline (line A). A minority peak is resolved at g = 7.33; this species represents a larger fraction of the total high spin content (~10%) than the similar species observed in the presence of L-thiocitrulline. The corresponding minority gy feature is now resolved at g = 4.46. Direct comparison of the spectral features of the nNOS-thiocitrulline and nNOS-homothiocitrulline spectra (Fig. 3, lines A and B) shows that the majority L-homothiocitrulline complex is intermediate in character between the two unresolved major L-thiocitrulline complexes. This is most readily apparent from the gy feature of the majority L-homothiocitrulline complex (g = 3.9), which lies between the two L-thiocitrulline-induced gy features (g = 3.98 and 3.83). The shifts in the positions of these high spin peaks and the shift in the spin state equilibrium toward the high spin state upon L-homothiocitrulline binding to nNOS are confirmed in the difference spectrum (Fig. 3, line B-C). Only weak low spin ferriheme features could be observed for L-homothiocitrulline at temperatures between 7 and 25°K, consistent with the type I spectral changes induced at room temperature (data not shown). In previous studies, we have used substrate- or inhibitor-perturbation optical difference spectroscopy to establish that L-arginine, NOH-Arg(23McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Google Scholar), L-thiocitrulline, and L-homothiocitrulline (24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar) alter the spin state equilibria of the heme cofactor of nNOS. Such studies were not able, however, to distinguish or structurally characterize specific high or low spin enzyme-ligand complexes. In the present studies, we show that EPR spectroscopy can be used not only to confirm the central findings of the optical studies but also to provide for each substrate or inhibitor a spectroscopic “fingerprint” characteristic of its interaction with the heme and heme-binding pocket. Table 1 summarizes the findings with respect to the species detected. In addition, the sensitivity of EPR spectra to ligand structure provides structural information on the binding of heme to nNOS and establishes a powerful probe of the interactions between the O2-binding position of heme and the L-arginine-binding site.TABLE I Open table in a new tab The power of EPR spectroscopy for these purposes derives from the exquisite sensitivity of the iron d orbitals in ferriheme to both the nature and number of axial ligands (1 or 2) and to subtle, heme-binding pocket-induced perturbations of the iron ligation geometry. More specifically, the features of the high spin nNOS EPR spectra near g = 7.6, 4, and 1.8 are associated with transitions within the lowest Kramer's doublet of the S = 5/2 sextet of high spin ferriheme. The g = 7.6 and g = 4 features derive from enzyme molecules in which the plane of the heme lies in the x and y direction of the Zeeman magnetic field; the z direction of the field (normal to the heme) gives rise to a transition near gz = 1.8 (Table 1). As long as intermixing of the Kramer's doublets by Zeeman terms (~0.3 cm-1) is small, the spectra are controlled by the ratio of E/D, where E is the rhombic zero field splitting parameter and D is the axial zero field splitting parameter(27Eisenberger P. Pershans P.S.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1966; 45: 2832-2835Google Scholar, 28Slappendel S. Veldink G.A. Vleigenthart J.F.G. Aasa R. Malmstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 667: 77-86Google Scholar). Terms in E mix the three S = 5/2 Kramer's doublets, splitting gx and gy about an axial value of ~6. 3Because the Zeeman terms are not completely negligible, the average value of gx and gy is lowered slightly from ~6 to 5.8 or 5.9. In addition, both gz and (gx + gy)/2 are lowered slightly by the second order effect of E on the S = 5/2 Kramer's doublets. These considerations were used to help assign the features shown in Fig. 1Fig. 2Fig. 3Fig. 4(e.g. in Fig. 3, line B the gx~7.33 peak could only be matched by a corresponding gy feature near 4.35). Because E and D are determined by the ligand-induced splittings of the iron d orbitals, they reflect both the identity of the axial ligands and the geometry of the heme site. For high spin nNOS, the only axial heme ligand is provided by an nNOS amino acid residue; in all cases E/D (Table 1) was in the range characteristic of enzymes and model complexes having thiolate ligands(29Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Adler A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 206: 310-327Google Scholar, 35Sono M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5496-5502Google Scholar). This finding directly confirms predictions of cysteine residue participation based on sequence analysis(10Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1991; 351: 714-718Google Scholar, 12Renard J.P. Boucher J.L. Vadon S. Delaforge M. Mansuy D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 53-60Google Scholar), spectral studies(11McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Google Scholar, 36Wang J. Stuehr D.J. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22255-22258Google Scholar), and work using mutational analysis(13Chen P.F. Tsai A.L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25062-25066Google Scholar, 16McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Google Scholar). Our data indicate that an enzyme thiolate-heme axial ligand bond similar to that of native nNOS persists in the complexes of nNOS with L-arginine, L-thiocitrulline, and L-homothiocitrulline, but it is notable that each of these ligands causes a characteristic shift in the EPR spectrum reflecting changes in E/D. 4For small values of E/D, the ratio is usually estimated from (gx - gy) = ~48 (E/D), yielding E/D = ~0.79(28Slappendel S. Veldink G.A. Vleigenthart J.F.G. Aasa R. Malmstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 667: 77-86Google Scholar). Actually this relationship slightly overestimates E/D, and better accuracy can be obtained by exact diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian D{Sz2 - 1/3[S(S + 1)]} + E(Sz2 - Sy2) as was done for the values in Table 1. We conclude then that the spectral changes observed after the addition of L-arginine are caused by a decrease in E/D from about 0.079 to 0.075. Because D is probably about 4 cm-1, this corresponds to a change in E on the order of 0.01 cm-1, from about 0.28 cm-1 to about 0.27 cm-1. The zero field splitting represented by D is caused by differential admixture by the spin orbit coupling of the three low lying quartet states into the ground state 6A1 sextet due to tetragonal splitting of the t2gd orbitals; for positive D, the dxy orbital lies lowest(37Kotani M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1969; 158: 20-49Google Scholar). The rhombic zero field splitting represented by E is in turn generated by differential admixture of the quartet states with spin paired electron in the dyz orbitals. The changes in E/D observed here are thus controlled through E by changes in the relative energy of these two d orbitals. Such changes indicate that binding of substrate or inhibitors induces a (probably local) conformational change in the enzyme that is reflected in a change in the geometry of the heme site. Note that none of the changes seen in the high spin spectral features are attributable to ligand-iron bond formation; if L-arginine contributed a sixth axial heme ligand, it would drive the heme low spin. This is not seen with the nNOS-arginine complex, a finding consistent with the fact that CO or O2 can still bind to the heme of such a complex in the ferrous state and that CN- can bind to the ferric complexes. The fact that native nNOS shows none of the ferriheme EPR spectral features of the nNOS-arginine complex indicates that nNOS as isolated does not contain L-arginine or any intermediates or substrate analogs that would distort the heme-binding pocket as L-arginine does. On the other hand, the finding that nNOS as isolated has at least 10% low spin heme suggests that in this fraction of the enzyme water or an adjacent residue in the active site is serving as a sixth axial heme ligand. The g values of the native nNOS low spin species indicate that the axial ligand opposite the thiol is oxygen(35Sono M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5496-5502Google Scholar). A small amount of species with gz = ~2.5 is usually present; this species may have a nitrogenous sixth ligand, probably derived from an amino acid side chain. The results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that both L-thiocitrulline and L-homothiocitrulline produce changes in the geometry of the heme site detectable by EPR spectroscopy. As indicated by E/D values of 0.081 and 0.087 (Table 1), the two major high spin components seen in the presence of L-thiocitrulline are both more rhombic than the high spin form of nNOS as isolated (E/D = 0.079). That is, although the energies of the dxz and dyz orbitals are more nearly equivalent in the arginine complex than in the enzyme as isolated, the inhibitors both appear to distort the heme iron ligation geometry in a way that increases the dxz - dyz splitting. We do not believe the E/D = 0.075 species of the nNOS-thiocitrulline complex is a remnant of the unliganded native state, which it closely resembles, for two reasons. First, the concentration of L-thiocitrulline used (100 μM) is >1000-fold the Ki(24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar) and presumably saturating. Second, the gz peak is shifted far enough to low field by L-thiocitrulline that there does not appear to be enough intensity at g values below 7.6 to account for the large component visible at g = ~4. The improved resolution of the g = ~4 feature may result in part from a small upfield shift, separating it somewhat from the rhombic iron signal. The minority component of the high spin L-thiocitrulline spectra with gx = ~7.33 has a significantly smaller rhombicity than even the L-arginine complex; E/D is about 0.06 (not listed in Table 1). Although the E/D value is low, the enzymatic thiolate ligand probably remains in place even in this complex. In the presence of L-homothiocitrulline, a similar complex (E/D = 0.063) is easily detected and is in sufficient concentration to resolve both the gx and gy signals (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Detection of multiple species suggests that in contrast to L-arginine, L-thiocitrulline and L-homothiocitrulline share an ability to bind in several different modes giving distinct high spin species. Whether these species represent alternative ligand structures (e.g. thione versus thiol tautomers) or alternative conformational adjustments in the binding site is unclear. We note that in normal catalysis, heme-bound oxygen first reacts with a guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine and that a second heme-bound oxygen then reacts with the guanidino carbon of NOH-Arg. In order to do this, the substrate-binding site may accommodate some slippage. The enzyme may have evolved to bind its normal substrate, L-arginine, uniquely, but L-thiocitrulline and L-homothiocitrulline may bind in either an L-arginine or a NOH-Arg mode. It is worth noting that although binding of L-thiocitrulline leads to the formation of two high spin species with increased rhombicity (compared with the enzyme as isolated and the arginine complex), the longer side chain of L-homothiocitrulline permits the formation of only one such species. The increased formation of the lower rhombicity (gx = 7.33) species suggests that this represents a binding mode/conformational state in which the extra length of the side chain is less energetically unfavorable. Whereas the nNOS-arginine (23McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9875-9880Google Scholar) and nNOS-homothiocitrulline (24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar) complexes are exclusively high spin, nNOS forms two distinct minority low spin complexes with L-thiocitrulline(24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table 1, neither of the nNOS-thiocitrulline low spin species can be attributed to the minority low spin species of nNOS as isolated; in all cases the g values are distinct. Furthermore, crystal field calculations indicate that the values of the axial and rhombic ligand field splittings Δ and V of the t2g set of iron d orbitals for the low spin state of nNOS as isolated are, respectively, about 5.66 and 1.9 (in units of spin orbit coupling) using the axis system introduced originally by Peisach et al.(29Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Adler A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 206: 310-327Google Scholar). The corresponding parameters for the L-thiocitrulline complexes are about 5.46 and 2.02 for the species with gz = 2.47 and about 5.96 and 1.83 for the species with gz = 2.39. If we refer these values to the Blumberg and Peisach crystal field diagrams(29Peisach J. Blumberg W.E. Adler A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 206: 310-327Google Scholar), we find the species fall in region P. This region contains low spin species with thiolate ligands; Δ and V for nNOS low spin species are comparable with ferriheme model complexes with a thiolate ligand described by several groups. All three low spin species appear to retain the endogenous axial thiolate ligand. The g = 2.39 nNOS-thiocitrulline species is similar to model complexes with gz between 2.33 and 2.42 in which both axial ligands are thiolate sulfurs(35Sono M. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5496-5502Google Scholar). This supports a model for L-thiocitrulline binding in which the inhibitor is close enough to the ferriheme to form a true coordination complex. Note, however, that this is a minority species; as shown previously in optical studies(24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar), most L-thiocitrulline is bound without direct sulfur-ferriheme coordination. The identity of the sixth heme ligand in the other two low spin complexes is less certain. Comparison with model complexes suggests that the sixth ligand may be oxygen in both cases. This is almost certainly the case for the native nNOS species with gz = ~2.43, but whether the sixth ligand is derived from solvent or the side chain of an nNOS amino acid is unclear. The difference between that low spin complex and the gz = 2.47 complex of L-thiocitrulline could be the result of a small distortion of the original ligand geometry rather than ligand replacement. We note that the gz = 2.47 peak seen with L-thiocitrulline is also consistent with a nitrogen ligand as might be expected if the inhibitor bound with the terminal thioureido nitrogen rather than the sulfur near heme. L-Citrulline, a product of NOS, does not inhibit (Ki ≥ 10 mM), although it could presumably bind similarly (i.e. with the thioureido nitrogen in the heme pocket). The present results, taken with previous kinetic and optical spectroscopy studies(24Frey C. Narayanan K. McMillan K. Spack L. Gross S.S. Masters B.S.S. Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26083-26091Google Scholar), demonstrate that L-arginine, L-thiocitrulline, and L-homothiocitrulline all bind tightly (Km and Ki < 0.06-10 μM) but distinctly to nNOS. Because binding is in all cases enantiomer-specific, the enzyme must associate similarly with the α-amino and carboxylate groups of the three species. On the other hand, the L-arginine side chain clearly adopts a unique high spin binding mode that is distinct from the multiple high spin binding modes seen with L-thiocitrulline and L-homothiocitrulline. The guanidino group of L-arginine does not contribute a sixth axial ligand to the heme cofactor or cause dissociation of the thiolate ligand but nonetheless converts the high spin state associated with nNOS as isolated to a high spin state with different properties. Because E and D, and hence the EPR spectra, are primarily a function of the ligand field splittings of the iron d orbitals, binding of arginine (and arginine analogs) must perturb the ligation geometry by more subtle interactions in the heme pocket. It does this presumably by directly interacting with and perturbing the heme porphyrin ring or by interacting with nNOS residues forming the heme pocket. This could transmit strain to the iron through interactions between the polypeptide and the porphyrin periphery or through the axial thiolate ligand. Whereas the high spin nNOS-arginine complex is less rhombic (lower gx) than the high spin form of nNOS as isolated, the majority high spin forms of nNOS-thiocitrulline and nNOS-homothiocitrulline are more rhombic (higher gx). These species, in which the ligand does not directly coordinate heme iron, must perturb the heme porphyrin or its binding pocket differently than does L-arginine. Although nNOS may have evolved to bind L-arginine uniquely, these synthetic inhibitors are bound in multiple modes with at least three high spin and two low spin states for L-thiocitrulline. It seems clear that arginine analogs with various substituents binding in the site normally occupied by the reactive guanidino nitrogen produce characteristic modifications of ligand-heme pocket interactions, which are reflected in characteristic spectroscopic signatures for each complex. Because this group is the initial hydroxylation site, it is apparent that only short range interactions need be invoked and that this part of the substrate-binding site interacts intimately with the heme. It will be interesting to explore the extent to which various EPR-detectable heme pocket perturbations are induced by ligand binding as specific structural changes are made to substrates and to inhibitors such as L-thiocitrulline."
https://openalex.org/W2152992155,"It has been demonstrated that Ras is involved in interleukin 3 (IL-3)-stimulated signal transduction in various hematopoietic cultured cells (Satoh, T., Nakafuku, M., Miyajima, A., and Kaziro, Y.(1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 3314-3318; Duronio, V., Welham, M. J., Abraham, S., Dryden, P., and Schrader, J. W.(1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 1587-1591). However, it has not been fully understood which of IL-3-promoted cellular responses, i.e. proliferation, survival, and differentiation, requires Ras function. We employed a system of inducible expression of the dominant-negative (S17N) or dominant-active (G12V) mutant of Ras in BaF3 mouse pro-B cell line to analyze the role of Ras in IL-3-stimulated signal transduction. Induction of the dominant-negative Ras(S17N) effectively inhibited the IL-3induced activation of c-Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Furthermore, the activation of fos gene promoter following IL-3 stimulation was almost completely abolished when Ras(S17N) was induced. Under these conditions, Ras(S17N) exhibited no inhibitory effect on IL-3-dependent proliferation assessed by the increase of cell numbers and a mitochondrial enzyme activity. The results indicate that Ras-dependent pathways, including the Raf/MAPK/Fos pathway, are dispensable for IL-3-induced growth stimulation. When BaF3 cells were treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, IL-3-dependent proliferation of the cells was impaired, suggesting that tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways are critical for growth promotion. On the other hand, apoptotic cell death caused by deprivation of IL-3 was prevented by the induction of the activated mutant Ras(G12V), although the rate of cell number increase was markedly reduced. Thus, it is likely that Ras-independent pathways play important roles to facilitate the proliferation although they may not be essential for IL-3-stimulated antiapoptotic signal transduction. It has been demonstrated that Ras is involved in interleukin 3 (IL-3)-stimulated signal transduction in various hematopoietic cultured cells (Satoh, T., Nakafuku, M., Miyajima, A., and Kaziro, Y.(1991) Proc.

In various types of cells, Ras functions as a molecular switch that regulates intracellular signaling pathways for proliferation, differentiation, and other physiological responses.

The active GTP-bound form of Ras specifically binds Ras-GAPs (Boguski and McCormick, 1993), c-Raf-1 (Avruch et al., 1994), B-Raf (Moodie et al., 1994; Vaillancourt et al., 1994), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994), Ral-guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (Hofer et al., 1994; Kikuchi et al., 1994; Spaargaren and Bischoff, 1994), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) kinase (MEKK) (Lange-Carter and Johnson, 1994), and Rin1 (Han and Colicelli, 1995), among which Raf proteins are best characterized as direct targets of Ras (Daum et al., 1994; Marshall, 1995). After the binding of Ras, the serine/threonine kinase activity of Raf is enhanced by interaction with membrane components (Leevers et al., 1994; Stokoe et al., 1994; Dent et al., 1995; Marais et al., 1995), and then the activated Raf stimulates MEK and MAPK. In addition to the Raf/MAPK pathway, it has been proposed that Rac-mediated pathways function downstream of Ras and are essential for the induction of transformed phenotypes by oncogenic Ras in Rat1 and NIH3T3 cells (Qiu et al., 1995). Furthermore, sequential activation of Rac and Rho upon cell stimulation to trigger the assembly of focal complexes has been reported (Nobes and Hall, 1995), suggesting a cascade of small GTPases. In fibroblast cells, Ras is implicated in the signal transduction of normal growth as well as malignant transformation. On the other hand, in PC12 pheochromocytoma and 3T3-L1 cells, Ras stimulates the differentiation to neuronal cells and adipocytes, respectively. It has also been revealed that Ras plays a crucial role in T cell activation signaling. Furthermore, in factor-dependent hematopoietic cell lines, accumulation of the active GTP-bound Ras was detected in response to the stimulation with various cytokines including IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and Steel factor, which induce both proliferation and differentiation (see Satoh et al. (1992b), Boguski and McCormick(1993), and Lowy and Willumsen(1993) for reviews). IL-3 is indispensable for survival and proliferation of a mouse pro-B cell line, BaF3. Upon binding of IL-3, the IL-3 receptor, consisting of a heterodimer of α and β subunits, triggers multiple signals, for instance, Ras-dependent, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) protein-mediated, and Myc-related pathways. It is likely that these signaling pathways cooperatively regulate cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation although the role and relationship of each pathway remain unclear (see Darnell et al.(1994), Ihle et al.(1994), and Sato and Miyajima(1994) for reviews). In this study, we investigated the roles of Ras-dependent signal transduction pathways in IL-3-induced cell growth of BaF3 cells by utilizing a system for inducible expression of dominant-negative (S17N) as well as dominant-active (G12V) mutants of Ras protein. The dominant-negative Ras(S17N) almost completely blocked the signal transduction downstream of Ras including the activation of c-Raf-1 protein and subsequent hyperphosphorylation of MAPK. Under these conditions, the cell growth was not interfered with at all, indicating that the Ras pathway may be dispensable for IL-3-promoted proliferation. It was also found that a constitutively active Ras(G12V) by itself was able to prevent the cells from apoptotic cell death caused by IL-3 deprivation.

LacSwitch inducible mammalian expression system(217450), including expression plasmids pOPRSVICAT and p3′SS, was purchased from Stratagene. Mouse IL-3 is a generous gift of Atsushi Miyajima and Satish Menon (DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, CA). Herbimycin A is a generous gift of Yoshimasa Uehara (National Institutes of Health, Tokyo). BaF3, N6, and V2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and mouse IL-3. For N6 and V2 cells, G418 (1 mg/ml) and hygromycin (1 mg/ml) were included in the culture medium. cDNA encoding a dominant-negative (S17N) (Szeberényi et al., 1990) or dominant-active (G12V) (Satoh et al., 1988) mutant of human c-Ha-ras was inserted between NotI cloning sites instead of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene within a mammalian expression vector pOPRSVICAT. The ras expression plasmids were introduced into BaF3 cells with p3′SS, which encodes Lac repressor, by electroporation, and appropriate transfectants were isolated using G418 (1.5 mg/ml) and hygromycin (1 mg/ml) essentially as described elsewhere (Satoh et al., 1993). Clones termed N6 (for Ras(S17N)) and V2 (for Ras(G12V)) were used for further experiments. Ras proteins were induced by adding 5 mM IPTG into the culture medium. Analyses of Ras-bound guanine nucleotide in N6 cells were performed as described elsewhere (Satoh et al., 1993). Cells were dissolved in IP buffer (50 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM NaPPi, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and the supernatant of centrifugation (1500 × g) for 3 min at 4°C was used as a cell lysate. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and a specific antibody were mixed gently with the lysate for 2 h at 4°C, and the precipitate was washed four times with IP buffer. Then, the precipitated proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blotted with a specific antibody, and the bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (DuPont NEN). Cells were lysed in LOB (20 mM Hepes•NaOH (pH 7.3), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A), and the supernatant of centrifugation (1500 × g) for 3 min at 4°C was mixed with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and anti-c-Raf-1 antibody (sc-227, 0.25 μg). The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C with gentle mixing, and the precipitate was washed twice with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl), and then once with kinase buffer (20 mM Hepes•NaOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2). The precipitated proteins were subjected to MEK kinase assay within a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Hepes•NaOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM NaF, 3.75 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.15 mM Na3VO4, 33.5 μg/ml His-MAPKK, 100 μg/ml GST-MAPK(K57D), 0.2 mM [γ-32P]ATP (37 TBq/mol) for 20 min at 30°C. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The colorimetric assay for cell survival and proliferation using MTT was carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Plasmids were introduced into BaF3 and N6 cells by electroporation as described elsewhere (Satoh et al., 1993). Following IL-3 stimulation, cell lysates were prepared using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and the luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Lumat LB9501, Berthold). Fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA during apoptotic cell death was assayed as follows. Cells (0.5-1.0 × 106) were dissolved in 450 μl of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris•HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100), chilled on ice for 10 min, and the lysate was obtained by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 10 min at 4°C. Nucleic acids were purified by ethanol precipitation following phenol/chloroform extraction, and dissolved in loading buffer (2% (w/v) Ficoll 400, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol). The samples were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis (2% (w/v) agarose) followed by treatment with ribonuclease A (100 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37°C. DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light. To clarify the role of Ras in IL-3-induced signal transduction for cell growth, we established cell lines in which the dominant-negative (S17N) or dominant-active (G12V) form of Ras protein is expressed in an inducible manner. Mouse IL-3-dependent BaF3 pro-B cells were used as the parental cell line. The cells were transfected with two expression plasmids; one for Ras and the other for the repressor of E. coli lactose operon (termed pOPRSVI-Ras and p3′SS, respectively). The repressor binds to the operator sequence that was inserted into the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-derived promoter of pOPRSVI-Ras to suppress the expression. When IPTG is added to the medium, the repressor is released from the lactose operator sequence, and transcription of the exogenously introduced cDNA is initiated. Two stable transfectants designated N6 (for Ras(S17N)) and V2 (for Ras(G12V)) were selected and characterized in detail. Fig. 1 shows the expression of the mutant Ras proteins in N6 and V2 cells upon stimulation with IPTG. In both cases, expression of the mutant Ras was detected after 4 h of treatment with IPTG and reached a plateau after 16 h. Faint bands of endogenous Ras were detected above Ras(S17N) in A, and below Ras(G12V) in B. It seems likely that a band of unmodified Ras(S17N) appears at the same position as the endogenous Ras after 24-h induction. We consider that it does not interfere with the action of modified Ras(S17N) because the population of the unmodified form seems relatively small. Evidence for the specific interaction between Ras and c-Raf-1 proteins was provided in various types of mammalian cells using several different methods, such as co-immunoprecipitation, affinity chromatography, and yeast two-hybrid systems (Koide et al., 1993; Avruch et al., 1994; Daum et al., 1994). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the blockade of c-Raf-1 function resulted in the failure of Ras to stimulate proliferation (Kolch et al., 1991), indicating that c-Raf-1 acts downstream from Ras. Hence, we examined whether the dominant-negative Ras(S17N) sufficiently inhibited the Ras-mediated pathway by comparing the activation of c-Raf-1 protein in response to IL-3 stimulation between IPTG-treated and untreated N6 cells. Endogenous c-Raf-1 protein was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody, and the kinase activity of the protein was assayed using recombinant MAPK kinase (MAPKK or MEK) as a substrate and by measuring the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into recombinant kinase-negative MAPK added to the reaction mixture. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, IL-3 rapidly triggered the activation of c-Raf-1 protein in N6 cells in the absence of IPTG, indicating that Ras/Raf pathway functions downstream of the IL-3 receptor. When the cells were treated with IPTG for 16 h, the induction of c-Raf-1 activation was completely diminished, suggesting that the induced Ras(S17N) interferes with the function of endogenous Ras. Then, we investigated the phosphorylation and subsequent activation of one of the endogenous MAPKs, ERK2, following IL-3 stimulation, which can be detected by immunoblotting as the appearance of mobility-shifted bands corresponding to phosphorylated ERK2. As shown in Fig. 2B, IL-3 induced the phosphorylation of ERK2 in a similar time course as c-Raf-1 activation in N6 cells without IPTG pretreatment, whereas, in cells treated with IPTG for 16 h prior to the addition of IL-3, ERK2 was no longer activated. Analyses of Ras-bound guanine nucleotide in N6 cells were carried out to confirm that Ras(S17N) actually inhibits the formation of an active form of Ras within the cell since it is well known that only a GTP-bound conformation can transduce the signal to downstream targets including c-Raf-1. The molar ratios of the GTP-bound form were: 2.6% in control and 18.5% in IL-3-stimulated N6 cells without IPTG pretreatment, and 1.8% in control and 5.4% in IL-3-stimulated cells after the induction of Ras(S17N) by IPTG, respectively. We next examined the effect of Ras(S17N) on IL-3-enhanced transcription from c-fos promoter using c-fos-luciferase as a reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3A, IL-3 stimulated the luciferase activity in control N6 cells, which was significantly reduced when Ras(S17N) was induced by IPTG treatment of the cell. Co-transfection of increasing amounts of a plasmid that expresses Ras(S17N) constitutively, designated pCMV5-Ras(S17N), also diminished IL-3-promoted transcription from c-fos promoter (Fig. 3B). The results indicate that c-fos induction in response to IL-3 stimulation is Ras-dependent, and the induction of Ras(S17N) with IPTG in N6 cells is sufficient for interfering with this signaling pathway. Then, we analyzed the effects of dominant-negative Ras(S17N) on IL-3-dependent cell survival and long-term proliferation (Fig. 4). N6 cells showed IL-3-dependent characteristics: they were not able to survive and proliferate in the absence of IL-3, while, in the presence of increasing concentrations of IL-3, MTT-reducing activity was detected, and the cells continuously proliferated. Interestingly, even when the dominant-negative Ras(S17N) was induced with IPTG, the growth properties did not change at all in spite of the almost complete abrogation of IL-3-dependent stimulation in the Raf/MAPK/Fos pathway as described in Figure 2:, Figure 3:. The results indicate that the Ras pathway is not essential for IL-3-induced growth stimulation in BaF3 cells. Various adaptor proteins and Ras-GEFs are involved in tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated activation of Ras (Schlessinger, 1993). Similarly, lymphokine receptors, for example IL-2 and IL-3 receptors, activate Ras through the interaction with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, adaptors, and Ras-GEFs (Burns et al., 1993; Cutler et al., 1993; Sato et al., 1993; Ravichandran and Burakoff; 1994; Welham et al., 1994). To test whether Ras(S17N) or Ras(G12V) might affect IL-3 receptor-stimulated responses of Ras regulators, we compared tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its interaction with Grb-2 in BaF3, N6, and V2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, when stimulated with IL-3 for 7 min, tyrosine phosphorylation of both species of Shc (p46 and p52) and Shc/Grb-2 association were observed in all of the above cell lines. A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with a molecular weight of 150,000 that was co-immunoprecipitated with Shc (Buday et al., 1994) was also detected in these cell lines (data not shown). Even though Ras(S17N) or Ras(G12V) was induced by IPTG treatment for 16 h, these responses were unaffected, suggesting that the mutant Ras proteins do not interfere with the signal transduction pathways upstream of Ras. To clarify whether IL-3-induced activation of tyrosine kinases and their interaction with downstream signaling molecules are required for cell growth, we next analyzed the effect of a tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor, herbimycin A. As illustrated in Fig. 6A, treatment of BaF3 cells with herbimycin A prior to the stimulation completely blocked both IL-3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and Shc/Grb-2 association. Moreover, herbimycin A-treated BaF3 cells were unable to survive and proliferate even in the presence of IL-3 (Fig. 6B). The results suggest that tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways are critical for the induction of cell growth in response to IL-3.Figure 6:Effects of herbimycin A on BaF3 cells. A, inhibition of IL-3-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and Shc/Grb-2 association. BaF3 cells were treated with herbimycin A (1 μg/ml) for 24 h prior to IL-3 stimulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p46shc and p52shc and association of Grb-2 with Shc in response to IL-3 were detected as described in Fig. 5. B, inhibition of cell number increase. Cell number increase of BaF3 cells cultivated within the culture medium in the presence ( ) or absence (•) of herbimycin A (1 μg/ml) is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although Ras is not essential for IL-3-dependent growth stimulation, it is possible that Ras may be involved in the growth signaling pathway. To clarify this point, we next studied the effects of dominant-active Ras(G12V) using V2 cells. In V2 cells, Ras(G12V) was induced after a 4-h treatment with IPTG as shown in Fig. 1. We measured MEK kinase activity of immunoprecipitated endogenous c-Raf-1 protein and the mobility retardation of ERK2 following the induction of Ras(G12V) in IL-3-deprived V2 cells. As shown in Fig. 7, both MEK kinase activity of c-Raf-1 and the hyperphosphorylation of ERK2 were markedly enhanced by Ras(G12V) even in the absence of IL-3 stimulation. In addition, we detected increased transcription from c-fos promoter in IPTG-induced V2 cells in the absence of IL-3 using the luciferase assay (data not shown). Under these conditions, we tested whether the cells are able to survive and proliferate. Fig. 8 illustrates the fragmentation of chromosomal DNA characteristic of apoptotic cell death. IL-3 starvation for 48 h caused apoptosis in both N6 and V2 cells. Whereas Ras(S17N) showed no effect on the induction of DNA fragmentation, Ras(G12V) effectively prevented the cells from the apoptotic cell death. The findings imply the participation of Ras protein in antiapoptosis signaling although Ras is not essential for IL-3-dependent survival of the cells. Fig. 9 shows growth properties of V2 cells in the presence or absence of IL-3. Like parental BaF3 and N6 cell lines, V2 cells were incapable of proliferating in the absence of IL-3. When Ras(G12V) was induced, V2 cells were able to survive and continue to proliferate in the absence of IL-3 although the growth rate was significantly decreased in comparison with the normal growth; doubling times were 48 h in the presence of Ras(G12V) and 15 h in the presence of IL-3, respectively. The results suggest that Ras is implicated not only in antiapoptotic signal transduction, but also in growth-promoting signaling to some extent.Figure 9:Effects of Ras(G12V) on proliferation of V2 cells. Numbers of V2 cells were measured in the culture medium with neither mouse IL-3 nor IPTG (5 mM) (•), in the presence of mouse IL-3 ( ), or in the presence of IPTG (5 mM) (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although Ras is activated upon IL-3 stimulation, it has not been clear whether the function of Ras is required for IL3-induced proliferation of hematopoietic cell lines. A dominant-negative mutant Ras(S17N), which binds to Ras-GEFs tightly to prevent its action toward endogenous Ras, has been utilized widely to evaluate whether Ras is essential for a particular signal transduction pathway (Feig and Cooper, 1988). In fibroblast cell lines, for example NIH3T3 cells, the dominant-negative Ras(S17N) efficiently blocks growth factor- or serum-induced DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression (Feig and Cooper, 1988; Cai et al., 1990). The mutant also inhibits nerve growth factor-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells without affecting the cell growth (Szeberényi et al., 1990). The results indicate that the function of Ras signaling pathway may differ depending on cell types. IL-3 triggers the activation of multiple signal transducing molecules. In the present study, we took advantage of an inducible expression system for dominant-negative and dominant-active mutant Ras proteins to assess the function of Ras in these pathways. Only Ras-independent pathways are activated when dominant-negative Ras(S17N) is induced in the presence of IL-3, whereas only Ras-dependent pathways are activated when dominant-active Ras(G12V) is induced in the absence of IL-3. The system allowed us to evaluate the function of Ras-dependent and Ras-independent signaling pathways in IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line BaF3. In this paper, it was demonstrated that the cells displayed normal phenotypes, that is IL-3-dependent survival and proliferation even when the dominant-negative form of Ras(S17N) was expressed sufficiently to inhibit the Ras-dependent signal transduction. On the other hand, when the dominant-active form of Ras(G12V) was present, the cells were capable of escaping apoptotic cell death and proliferating without IL-3 stimulation although the growth rate was significantly lowered. Furthermore, it was shown that tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor, herbimycin A, blocked the cell growth as well as Shc/Grb-2 interaction. Thus, in conclusion, it is likely that tyrosine kinase-mediated, but Ras-independent signaling pathways are essential for transmitting sufficient signals for the induction of cell growth, whereas the Ras-dependent pathway is dispensable. Several signaling molecules other than Raf family proteins, for instance, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994), Ral-guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (Hofer et al., 1994; Kikuchi et al., 1994; Spaargaren and Bischoff, 1994), and MEKK (Lange-Carter and Johnson, 1994), have been proposed to be direct targets of Ras although it is not clear whether these molecules function within BaF3 cells. Furthermore, Rac-mediated pathways, which are also downstream from Ras, were recently reported to be independent of the Raf kinase cascade and essential for malignant transformation of fibroblast cells (Qiu et al., 1995). We consider that signaling pathways targeted by Ras•GTP other than the Raf/MAPK pathway must be blocked as well if the Raf/MAPK pathway is completely abolished because all effectors of Ras are thought to interact with only GTP-bound active conformation of Ras, and Ras(S17N) inhibits extracellular signal-dependent accumulation of this conformation. We actually observed that the formation of Ras•GTP within N6 cells upon IL-3 stimulation was limited to a lower level when Ras(S17N) was induced. However, if the affinities between Ras and different target molecules are different, we cannot exclude completely the possibility that the residual Ras activity may be sufficient for stimulating a downstream signaling pathway other than the Raf/MAPK pathway, which is essential for growth stimulation. We described that the activation of the endogenous c-Raf-1 and ERK2 elicited by IL-3 treatment was reduced considerably when Ras(S17N) was induced. The results also indicate that, in BaF3 cells, the Raf/MAPK pathway is dependent on Ras, which is similar to the signal transduction of platelet-derived growth factor, insulin, and nerve growth factor (de Vries-Smits et al., 1992; Thomas et al., 1992; Wood et al., 1992), but distinct from the case of epidermal growth factor, in which multiple pathways are responsible for the activation of MAPK (Burgering et al., 1993). Likewise, the transcriptional activation of the c-fos gene is dependent on Ras function in BaF3 cells. Okuda et al.(1994) recently reported that 32D myeloid cells failed to proliferate in response to IL-3 when the dominant-negative Ras(S17N) was induced, whereas they were able to survive for more than 2 weeks in the presence of Ras(S17N) and IL-3. In addition, they found that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced differentiation to neutrophiles was not affected by Ras(S17N) (Okuda et al., 1994). The discrepancy between their results and ours may be due to the difference in the signal transduction networks between the two types of hematopoietic cells. IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors share the common β subunit, which plays a pivotal role in signal transduction. From analyses using a set of deletion mutants of the common β subunit, a cytoplasmic region responsible for Ras activation was identified (Sato et al., 1993). Kinoshita et al.(1995) have recently reported that mutant GM-CSF receptors lacking the ability to stimulate the Ras/Raf pathway failed to suppress apoptosis, but they were still able to exert DNA synthesis. In addition, they showed that the activated Ras(G12V) could overcome the mutants' inability to prevent the cell death. In our experiments, the expression of Ras(S17N) did not result in apoptosis (Fig. 8), and the cells could proliferate continuously (Fig. 4). Hence, it is possible that a Ras-independent pathway that is sufficient for the survival of the cells may be activated through the C-terminal domain of the common β subunit. In IL-2 signal transduction, it has been proposed that three distinct signaling pathways mediated by Bcl-2, Myc, and a tyrosine kinase Lck, respectively, are regulated by IL-2 receptor (Miyazaki et al., 1995). Analyses using deletion mutants of the IL-2 receptor β subunit have revealed that the activation of a tyrosine kinase is required for the induction of Ras•GTP formation, as well as the fact that a mutant that is incapable of stimulating the Ras pathway can stimulate DNA synthesis (Satoh et al., 1992a). The results imply that Ras-dependent signals may not crucial for proliferation also in IL-2 signaling system. Several kinds of Ras-independent pathways, for example the JAK/STAT pathway and myc-related pathway, have been reported. A member of the JAK family tyrosine kinases, JAK2, is known to bind to the membrane-proximal region of the common β subunit of IL-3 receptor. Following IL-3 stimulation, JAK2 is activated and subsequently phosphorylates STAT5, which induces the transcription of specific genes (Silvennoinen et al., 1993; Quelle et al., 1994; Azam et al., 1995; Mui et al., 1995) although the role of this pathway has not been fully manifested. Furthermore, it is possible that adaptors, such as Shc and Grb-2, which function downstream from tyrosine kinases, may also regulate a Ras-independent signaling cascade for cell growth. Clarification of the role of Ras in the network of multiple signaling pathways, including proliferation and differentiation, stimulated through lymphokine receptors must await further investigation.

https://openalex.org/W1493434285,"Monoclonal antibodies to the αLβ2 integrin inhibit the binding of type I collagen to PMN (polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes) as well as the subsequent stimulation of superoxide production and enzyme secretion elicited by this collagen. Pepsinized collagen still binds PMN but no longer stimulates them. The I domain of the α chain of the integrin is involved in the binding. Two sequences of the α1(I) polypeptide chain of collagen participate in the process. Experiments of competitive inhibition by synthetic peptides showed that the sequence RGD (915-917) is used for binding to the cells and DGGRYY (1034-1039) serves to stimulate PMN. Experiments of radioactive labeling of the cells and affinity chromatography on Sepharose-collagen confirmed the presence in PMN extracts of two proteins, 95 and 185 kDa, respectively, corresponding to the molecular weights of the β2 and αL chains of the integrin and recognized by their specific monoclonal antibodies.The transduction pathways depending on the αLβ2 integrin do not involve a G protein (ruled out by the use of cholera and pertussis toxins), whereas the cytoskeleton was found to participate in the process, as evidenced by inhibition by cytochalasin B. After collagen stimulation, cytoplasmic inositol trisphosphate and calcium ion increased sharply for less than 2 min. The use of the inhibitors staurosporine and calphostin C demonstrated that protein kinase C was involved. Evaluation of the activity of this enzyme showed that, upon stimulation of PMN with collagen I, it was translocated to plasma membrane.Acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein bands corresponding to the integrin αLβ2, followed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine, permitted us to demonstrate that, prior to stimulation by type I collagen, there was no phosphorylation, whereas after stimulation, both αLand β2 chains were stained by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The adhesion of PMN to pepsinized type I collagen triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of the β2 chain of the integrin, without stimulating O⨪2 production by these cells, whereas their stimulation by complete type I collagen induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of both αL and β2 subunits. The tyrosine phosphorylation of both integrin subunits during transduction of stimuli is a heretofore undescribed phenomenon that may correspond to a new system of transmembrane communication. Monoclonal antibodies to the αLβ2 integrin inhibit the binding of type I collagen to PMN (polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytes) as well as the subsequent stimulation of superoxide production and enzyme secretion elicited by this collagen. Pepsinized collagen still binds PMN but no longer stimulates them. The I domain of the α chain of the integrin is involved in the binding. Two sequences of the α1(I) polypeptide chain of collagen participate in the process. Experiments of competitive inhibition by synthetic peptides showed that the sequence RGD (915-917) is used for binding to the cells and DGGRYY (1034-1039) serves to stimulate PMN. Experiments of radioactive labeling of the cells and affinity chromatography on Sepharose-collagen confirmed the presence in PMN extracts of two proteins, 95 and 185 kDa, respectively, corresponding to the molecular weights of the β2 and αL chains of the integrin and recognized by their specific monoclonal antibodies.

The tyrosine phosphorylation of both integrin subunits during transduction of stimuli is a heretofore undescribed phenomenon that may correspond to a new system of transmembrane communication. INTRODUCTIONType I collagen, a major component of the extra cellular matrix, promotes the adhesion of a variety of cells in solid tissues, influencing many processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cell shape changes(1Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Google Scholar). Several receptor molecules have been demonstrated as promoting the adhesion to type I collagen. Among these receptors, some belong to the family of integrins, for instance α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1(2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar). On the other hand, some types of mobile cells also interact with collagens, for instance polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN),1 a variety of leukocytes circulating in blood, capable of crossing the vascular wall in order to invade the inflamed tissues and to participate in defenses against bacteria or foreign molecules through their property of phagocytosis. In several previous papers, we demonstrated that PMN and type I collagen do interact and began to describe their interactions (3Monboisse J.C. Bellon G. Dufer J. Randoux A. Borel J.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 599-603Google Scholar, 4Monboisse J.C. Bellon G. Randoux A. Dufer J. Borel J.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 459-462Google Scholar, 5Monboisse J.C. Garnotel R. Randoux A. Dufer J. Borel J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 50: 373-380Google Scholar).Purified type I collagen is able to bind to PMN in vitro. This binding is followed by the stimulation of some main functions of PMN, such as emission of pseudopods, secretion of lytic enzymes, and liberation of superoxide. We demonstrated that the stimulation of PMN by collagen occurs through two sequences of the α1(I) chain, both located in the C-terminal region of the molecules, an RGD sequence corresponding to residues 915-917, and a DGGRYY sequence corresponding to residues 1034-1039, located at the C-terminal extremity of the chain. The type I collagen molecule, either fibrillar or denatured, is active, whereas pepsinized collagen, lacking the C-terminal telopeptide, is not. The cyanogen-bromide cleaved peptide α1(I)-CB6, which contains the C-terminal residues (823-1039) of the α1 chain, is also active. In contrast, the addition of the peptides RGD and DGGRYY either separately or together induces an inhibition of PMN. Both sequences must be contained in the same peptidic molecule to remain active on PMN.By using monoclonal antibodies, we were able to demonstrate that the β2 chain of the integrins is involved in the process of binding of PMN onto type I collagen. The main integrins already found in the membrane of PMN all belong to the group of β2 integrins and are αLβ2 (also termed CD11a-CD18, LFA 1), αMβ2 (CD11b-CD18 or Mac 1), and αXβ2 (CD11c-CD18, p150-95).The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the receptor of type I collagen is the integrin αLβ2, that this integrin mediates not only the binding but also transduction of the stimulation message, and that this phenomenon depends on the tyrosine-phosphorylation of both the αL and β2 subunits. We also point out some new details on the system of transduction operating intracellularly beyond the receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsType I collagen was prepared from rat tail tendon by 0.1 M acetic acid extraction(6Piez K.A. Eigner E.A. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 58-66Google Scholar). Ferricytochrome c (type VI), superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes, bovine serum albumin, fMet-Leu-Phe, pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, cytochalasin B, lactoperoxidase, H-7 (1-(isoquinolenylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine), staurosporine, were all purchased from Sigma. Calphostin C was bought from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The following monoclonal antibodies were used: P4C10, recognizing the β1 integrin subunit (Life Technologies, Inc.); 4-G7, raised toward the lymphocyte surface antigen Leu-12, D-12, recognizing CD11b, and 5-HCl-3, recognizing CD11c, all from Becton-Dickinson (Mountain View, CA); MHM-24, raised against CD11a, MHK-23, recognizing CD18 from Dakopatts (Glosdrup, Denmark); MEM-25, Bear-1, FK-24, and MEM-48, recognizing CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, respectively, from Monosan (Tebu, Paris, France). Monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine (clone 6G9, Life Technologies; and PY 20, Calbiochem) were used.The synthetic peptides GRGD, DGGRYY, RFDS, CGRGDSPC, and CGRGESPC were synthesized by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Fura-2 was bought from Molecular Probes Inc (Eugene, OR). Na125I and [3H]inositol were from DuPont NEN.Preparation of PMNHuman blood was obtained on consent from healthy subjects. PMN were isolated according to a previously published method (4Monboisse J.C. Bellon G. Randoux A. Dufer J. Borel J.P. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 459-462Google Scholar) involving a single-step centrifugation procedure through a Metrizoate-Polyprep gradient (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) at 240 × g for 35 min at room temperature. The PMN-rich layer was drawn, washed once in Dulbecco's solution, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The contaminating erythrocytes were eliminated by hypotonic lysis in 15 mM ammonium chloride. The cells were finally suspended at 107/ml in Dulbecco's solution, pH 7.4, containing 1.3 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+, at 4°C. The percentage of PMN in cell preparations exceeded 95%, and the cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, was over 98%.Experiments of Cell AdhesionPolystyrene 96-well plates (Nunc, Copenhagen, Denmark) were coated with type I collagen solubilized in 0.1 ml of 0.018 M acetic acid solution at a concentration of 50 μg/well. The protein-containing plates were washed three times with 150 mM NaCl prior to the addition of 1.5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of Dulbecco's solution containing 1.3 mM Ca2+ and 0.5 mM Mg2+. After a 30-min incubation period, the non-adherent cells were discarded. The adherent cells were fixed with 100 μl of a 1.1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution for 15 min. After extensive washing with distilled water, 0.1 ml of crystal violet solution (100 mg/100 ml in 0.2 M Hepes buffer, pH 6.0) was added to every well, left for 15 min, and discarded. The adhesion of PMN was evaluated spectrophotometrically as the absorbance of the stained nuclei at 560 nm, according to Kueng(7Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger V. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Google Scholar).Measurement of Superoxide Ion (O⨪2)The O⨪2 release was measured from the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c, according to English(8English D. Roloff J.S. Lukens J.M. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 165-171Google Scholar). The PMN suspension (106 cells in 100 μl) was added to a small glass test tube containing 0.1 ml of 1 μM cytochrome c solution and 0.85 ml of Dulbecco's solution. O⨪2 release was induced by adding 0.1 ml of the activating agent solution (either fMet-Leu-Phe at the concentration 0.1 μM in saline or 0.3 μM type I collagen in 0.018 M acetic acid solution). The increase in absorbance was followed spectrophotometrically as an index of the amount of liberated superoxide. Test tubes supplemented with 0.05 ml of superoxide dismutase solution in saline were taken as blanks assessing the specificity of the reaction.Measurement of Granule SecretionA 0.1-ml aliquot containing 106 PMN was added to 0.8 ml of Dulbecco's solution and 0.1 ml of collagen solution (final concentration 0.3 μM) already mixed in a glass test tube. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were then removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min and the enzymatic activities measured in the supernatant.The evaluations of elastase and of 92-kDa type IV collagenase were performed using N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide and biotinylated type IV collagen as substrates, for incubation periods of 1 and 3 h, respectively, according to the methods of Nakajima et al.(9Nakajima K. Powers J.C. Ashe B.M. Zimmerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4027-4032Google Scholar) and of Wilkinson et al.(10Wilkinson M.J. Cohen R.L. Shuman M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 294-296Google Scholar). The N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase activity was measured according to the method of Troost et al.(11Troost J. Van der Heijden M.C.M. Stall G.E.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1976; 73: 329-346Google Scholar). Lactic dehydrogenase, whose evaluation permits to verify the absence of cell lysis, was evaluated as described by Buhl et al.(12Buhl S.N. Jackson K.J. Graffunder B. Clin. Chem. 1978; 24: 261-266Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities released in the medium were expressed as percentage of the corresponding total activity of the cell lysate.Effect of Monoclonal Antibodies on PMNTreff polypropylene microtubes (Polylabo, Strasbourg, France) were coated with 1.5 ml of fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) by agitation at 37°C for 1 h and then extensively washed with a 0.15 M NaCl solution. A 0.1-ml volume of antibody solution, at the appropriate titer, was added to each tube, followed by the PMN suspension in Dulbecco's solution, in order to achieve a final concentration of 6 × 106 cells in 0.75 ml. Test tubes were shaken horizontally in a mechanical shaker for 90 min at 150 cycles/min (13Nathan C. Srimal S. Farber C. Sanchez E. Kabbash L. Asch A. Gailit J. Wright S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1341-1349Google Scholar).Affinity ChromatographyTen mg of purified type I collagen were covalently coupled to 1 ml of packed beads of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In parallel, a suspension of 20 × 106 cells in 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline was iodinated using the lactoperoxidase method of Lebien et al.(14Lebien T.W. Boue D.R. Bradley J.G. Kersey J.H. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2287-2292Google Scholar). Iodination was carried out on ice by addition of 200 μg of lactoperoxidase followed by 37 MBq of Na125I dissolved in 0.1 ml of water and two additions of 20 μl of 0.12% (w/v) hydrogen peroxide at a 5-min interval. Reaction was terminated by adding 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were washed three times with this solution. The cells were then extracted in 1 ml of a 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% aprotinin (w/v), 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Following clarification by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, the lysate was diluted 1/5 with a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4 containing 1.3 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. This dilution was necessary to reduce the concentration of Nonidet P-40 and SDS. The extract was transferred onto the collagen-Sepharose 4B beads in batch and incubated overnight in the same conditions. The suspension was then packed into a 1.0-cm diameter glass column and washed at 4°C by buffer A at a flow of 5 ml/h.The bound material was eluted first with a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, at a rate of 1 ml/h, then with the same buffer containing 1.0 M NaCl in the place of 150 mM. In some instances, the proteins were sequentially eluted by the specific peptides, first by 4 ml of a 3 mM solution of synthetic DGGRYY, then by 4 ml of a 3 mM solution of CGRGDSPC. Both peptides were dissolved in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% (w/v) n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin.Fractions of 1 ml were collected and their radioactivity counted with an automatic γ counter (Kontron MR-480) in order to monitor the elution. For characterization of the eluted substances, the proteins contained in 200-μl aliquots corresponding to the peaks of radioactivity were precipitated by addition of ethanol to 80% (v/v). The precipitates were redissolved in Laemmli sample buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and submitted to electrophoresis in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Radioactive bands were revealed by exposure to a Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Corp.) for convenient periods of time.ImmunoprecipitationsAliquots of 200 μl of the eluted fractions were coupled to the monoclonal antibodies and to protein A-Sepharose by incubation at 4°C for 2 h. The Sepharose-adsorbed material was washed three times with 3 ml of Tris-buffered saline. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and detected by autoradiography as described above(16Chatila T.A. Geha R.S. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3435-3444Google Scholar).Preincubation of PMN with Specific or Competitive InhibitorsPMN were incubated for 10 min at 37°C either with pertussis toxin (final concentration 100-500 ng/ml), with cholera toxin (2.5 μg/ml), with cytochalasin B (2.5 μg/ml), with the protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine (0-500 nM), H-7 (0-1000 μM), calphostin C (0-500 nM), or with the inhibitor of tyrosine kinase genistein (0-2.0 μg/ml). After this preincubation, they were stimulated by addition of 0.1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe or of 0.3 μM collagen I. The production of superoxide was evaluated by spectrophotometry of the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c as indicated above.In another series of experiments, PMN were preincubated for 15 min at 37°C with the synthetic peptides RFDS, GRGD, CGRGDSPC, CGRGESPC, or DGGRYY at various concentrations. At the end of this incubation, they were stimulated by addition of 0.3 μM collagen I. The O⨪2 production and enzyme-rich granule release were evaluated as described above.Intracellular Calcium Ion MeasurementThe intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured according to Grynkiewicz et al.(17Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). A suspension of PMN (107/ml), in a Dulbecco's solution containing 1.3 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM glucose, was loaded with 0.5 μM Fura-2-AM for 30 min at 37°C, rinsed twice with Dulbecco's solution, and sedimented. The cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's solution at an amount of 107 cells/ml. Two ml of this suspension were transferred into the cuvette of a Shimadzu RF 5000 spectrofluorometer. The apparatus was set up at two excitation wave lengths of 340 and 380 nm, and the emitted fluorescence monitored at 510 nm for 3 min in order to determine the basal level, the stimulating agent (final concentration 0.1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe or 0.3 μM type I collagen) was added and fluorescence recorded for 10 min. At the end of each experiment, cells were lysed by adding a 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 solution and the maximal fluorescence measured. Minimal fluorescence was also determined after addition of 2.0 mM MnCl2 solution. Results were expressed as nanomoles of Ca2+/107 cells.Intracellular Inositol Trisphosphate MeasurementPMN were suspended at a concentration of 107 cells/ml in Dulbecco's solution containing 0.0025% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and were incubated with 1.11 MBq of [3H]inositol for 120 min at 37°C. Ten minutes before the end of this incubation, 1 ml of a solution of 10 mM LiCl2 was added in order to inhibit the hydrolysis of inositol phosphate. Finally, the cells loaded with [3H]inositol were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's solution containing 10 mM LiCl2 and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in fresh Dulbecco's solution.The experiment was performed after several types of stimuli had been applied to the cells, either 0.1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe or 0.3 μM type I collagen. The incubation was stopped at various times (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 5.0 min) by addition of 0.15 ml of a 35% (w/v) sodium perchlorate solution. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatants were neutralized with a 9.0 M KOH solution and deposited at the top of columns of Dowex AG-1X8 (200-400-mesh) equilibrated under the formate form. The column was eluted sequentially with 3 ml of distilled water (for free [3H]inositol), 10 ml of 5 mM sodium tetraborate/60 mM sodium formate (for glycerophospho[3H]inositol), 14 ml of 0.1 M formic acid/0.2 M ammonium formate (for [3H]inositol phosphate), 18 ml of 0.1 M formic acid/0.5 M ammonium formate (for [3H]inositol bisphosphate), 18 ml of 0.1 M formic acid/1.0 M ammonium formate (for [3H]inositol trisphosphate), according to the method of Berridge(18Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 345-360Google Scholar). The radioactivity of the eluted fractions was measured in a Packard 1900 TR liquid scintillation counter. Results were expressed as percentage of total inositol phosphate.Measurement of Protein Kinase C ActivityProtein kinase C activity was evaluated in the particular or in the cytosolic fractions of PMN stimulated with fMet-Leu-Phe, PMA, or type I collagen, according to the method described by Kikkawa et al.(19Kikawa U. Minakuchi R. Takay Y. Nishizuka Y. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 288-298Google Scholar).Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the αLβ2IntegrinThe suspension of PMN (107 cells/ml) in Dulbecco's solution containing 1.3 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, was first preincubated for 30 min at 20°C in the presence of 2.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Then temperature was raised to 37°C for 5 min prior to the addition of the stimulating agent (Dulbecco's solution as a control, 0.1 μM fMet-Leu-Phe peptide in Dulbecco's solution, or 0.3 μM type I collagen in Dulbecco's solution). The incubation was stopped after 2 min by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 4 s at 4°C. The supernatants were discarded and the cells lysed by addition of 150 μl of a 0.05 M Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM orthovanadate, 1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin A)(20Grinstein S. Furuya W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18122-18125Google Scholar). Cell lysis took place within 10 min at 4°C.A 100-μl aliquot of cell extract was immunoprecipitated by addition of anti-CD18 or anti-CD11a monoclonal antibodies (6 μg/ml), followed by adsorption on protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitated material was fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and blotted on a transfer Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was saturated by incubation for 1 h with a 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl and 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, then incubated for 2 h in the presence of monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine (clone 6G9 or clone PY-20). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) was used as a second antibody, for detection of the positive protein bands visualized by the reaction with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in the presence of nitro blue tetrazolium.For the evaluation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the αLβ2 integrin subunits, PMN (5 × 107 cells) were labeled with 18.5 MBq of 32PO4H3 for 30 min and then incubated with 0.3 μM type I collagen (pepsinized or not). The membrane extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD18 or anti-CD11a antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The integrin subunits were submitted to an alkaline treatment prior to 5.7 M HCl hydrolysis. Phosphoamino acids were derivatized with 9-fluorenylmethylchloroformate (Fmoc) according to (21Niedbalski J.S. Ringer D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 138-145Google Scholar), and the Fmoc-derivatives were analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on an Hypersil RP 18 (5 μm) column.RESULTSIdentification of the Sequences of Type I Collagen Responsible for Adhesion and StimulationPreparations of PMN were submitted to the effect of solutions of synthetic peptides containing sequences RGD and DGGRYY. After a 15-min treatment, an aliquot of cells was added onto type I collagen molecules layered to the bottom of the wells of culture polystyrene plates. Adhesion to collagen and production of O⨪2 by these cells were measured (Table 1). The linear peptide GRGD and the control peptide RFDS did not exert any significant action. On the other hand, the peptide CGRGDSPC, which contains RGD in a loop formed under the influence of a disulfide bridge, exerted an inhibiting effect of about 50% on both adhesion and superoxide production, whereas peptide CGRGESPC did not. This effect was slightly dose-dependent. Peptide DGGRYY did not inhibit the binding of PMN to type I collagen but inhibited the formation of O⨪2 in a dose-dependent manner. The secretion by PMN of lytic enzymes such as elastase or gelatinase was found to be inhibited by the peptides CGRGDSPC or DGGRYY in parallel to superoxide liberation (Table 2).TABLE I Open table in a new tab TABLE II Open table in a new tab Identification of LFA 1 as the Receptor for Type I Collagen on PMN MembraneIn experiments similar to the previous one, monoclonal antibodies to the various subunits of the β2 integrins were incubated with PMN, then the adhesion of the cells was measured as well as superoxide secretion (Table 3) and granule exocytosis (Table 4). Two monoclonal antibodies recognizing the β2 chain of integrins, MHM 23 and MEM 48, were found to inhibit both adhesion of PMN to collagen and secretions of superoxide and lytic enzymes. On the other hand, one of the monoclonal antibodies recognizing the αL chain, MEM 25, inhibited both adhesion and stimulation of the cells, whereas the second monoclonal antibody to the αL chain did not induce any inhibition. The secretions of lytic enzymes by PMN, such as elastase or gelatinase induced by type I collagen, were found to be inhibited by the same monoclonal antibodies as superoxide liberation. The monoclonal antibodies inhibited the secretions by PMN in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). None of the monoclonal antibodies recognizing αM or αX chains inhibited adhesion or activation of PMN.TABLE III Open table in a new tab TABLE IV Open table in a new tab Isolation of the ReceptorThe isolation of the receptor membrane protein was undertaken by the method of affinity chromatography on a column of type I collagen-Sepharose. The elution diagram is shown on Fig. 2. Two peaks were found, one eluted with buffer A containing 5 mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl and the second with the same buffer A containing 1 M NaCl.Figure 2:Elution profile of the affinity chromatography of a PMN extract performed on type I collagen-Sepharose. The left arrow represents the start of elution by 150 mM NaCl + 5 mM EDTA. The right arrow represents the start of elution by 1 M NaCl + 5 mM EDTA. Inset, characterization by SDS-PAGE of the fractions eluted from the affinity column of collagen-Sepharose. Electrophoresis carried out in 7.5% polyacrylamide gel at pH 8.3. Detection by autoradiography. Lane 1, molecular size standards revealed by Coomassie Blue; lane 2, total extract from iodinated membrane; lane 3, peak 1; lane 4, peak 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SDS-PAGE was performed on the proteins contained in both peaks (Fig. 2, inset). The first peak of elution contained two major bands with respective apparent molecular masses of 95 and 185 kDa as estimated by comparison to control globular proteins of known molecular mass. In addition, this peak contained two minor bands, of 31 and 35 kDa, respectively. Peak two contained these 31- and 35-kDa proteins as major bands.The identity of the proteins contained in these peaks was verified by immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal antibodies anti-CD18 and anti-CD11a. The precipitated molecules were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The antibody anti-CD18 precipitated the two proteins of molecular masses 95 and 185 kDa from peak 1 (Fig. 3A). No material from peak 2 was precipitated by this antibody. Similar results were obtained with the antibody anti-CD11a (Fig. 3B).

https://openalex.org/W2025041865,"Previous studies have shown that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-4 (IGFBP-4) is degraded only in the presence of exogenous IGFs; however, we found that cation-dependent proteinase activity present in conditioned medium of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts degrades 125I-recombinant human (rh)IGFBP-4 in the absence of IGFs. Addition of IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin to conditioned medium had little affect on 125I-rhIGFBP-4 proteolysis, while extraction of IGFs resulted in only a ∼10% reduction in proteinase activity. Since factors other than IGFs appeared to be involved in regulating IGFBP-4 proteolysis, we hypothesized that IGFBP-3, an IGFBP produced by many cell lines, but not MC3T3-E1 cells, might function as an inhibitor of IGFBP-4 proteolysis. Addition of rhIGFBP-3 to conditioned media inhibited 125I-rhIGFBP-4 proteolysis by 90%, while IGF-I and IGF-II reversed the inhibitory effects of rhIGFBP-3 in a dose-dependent manner. 125I-rhIGFBP-4 proteolysis was not inhibited by N-terminal rhIGFBP-3 fragments that bind IGFs, but was inhibited by two synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences contained in the mid-region or C-terminal region of IGFBP-3. Both inhibitory peptides contain highly basic, putative heparin-binding domains and heparin partially reversed the inhibitory effects of rhIGFBP-3 on 125I-rhIGFBP-4 proteolysis. These data demonstrate that rhIGFBP-3 inhibits IGFBP-4-degrading proteinase activity and binding of IGFs or glycosaminoglycans to IGFBP-3 may induce conformational changes in the binding protein, causing disinhibition of the proteinase.

Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fosså A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Google Scholar) opened up a new perspective on the evolution of β-oxidation systems (Fig. 1). The peroxisomal MFEs of higher (mammals and plants) and lower eukaryotes (fungi) not only catalyze two reactions of opposite chiral specificity, but they also have different native molecular sizes and distinct amino acid sequences, indicating different phylogenetic origins(18Hiltunen J.K.

Fosså A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Google Scholar), we studied whether the stereochemistry plays a role in the evolution of β-oxidation systems. As fungi possess only a peroxisomal β-oxidation(20Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.-H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Google Scholar, 21Kunau W.-H. Bühne S. Moreno de la Garza M. Kionka C. Mateblowski M. Schultz-Borchard U. Thieringer R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 16: 418-420Google Scholar), this yeast mutant does not degrade fatty acids and is thus unable to grow on fatty acids as a carbon source. We replaced the yeast endogenous MFE, comprising 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 and D-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities(18Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fosså A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Google Scholar), with its peroxisomal counterpart in the rat, possessing enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 and L-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities(7Osumi T.

This replacement resulted in functional complementation giving the YFOX-2 cells back their capability to grow on oleic acid. The S. cerevisiae strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for all transformations and plasmid isolations.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Into a YEp352 vector containing the catalase A sequence from S. cerevisiae (CTA1) (23Cohen G. Rapatz W. Ruis H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 159-163Google Scholar) and modified as described by Kragler et al.(24Kragler F. Langeder A. Raupachova J. Binder M. Hartig A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 665-673Google Scholar), an additional unique restriction site was introduced by cutting with HindIII, dephosphorylating, and ligating again in the presence of a polynucleotide kinase-treated oligonucleotide representing the XhoI site (5′-AGCTTCTCGAGA-3′). The resulting plasmid pYE352-CTA1 contains the whole CTA1 gene with modifications allowing the replacement of the open reading frame by cutting with XbaI or SacI and HindIII or XhoI (Fig. 2A). The coding region of cDNA for rat MFE (25Osumi T Ishii N. Hijikata M. Kamijo K. Ozasa H. Furuta S. Miyazawa S. Kondo K. Inoue K. Kagamiyama H. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8905-8910Google Scholar) was obtained from total RNA isolated from clofibrate-treated rat liver by reverse transcription with moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and amplification by polymerase chain reaction using rat MFE-specific primers and cloned into pUC18 vector using the Sure Clone cloning kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) This pUC18-rMFE was used as template for polymerase chain reaction with specific oligonucleotide primers containing unique restriction sites in their 5′ ends. The resulting rMFE cDNA had an extra SacI restriction site in the 5′ end and an XhoI cutting site in the 3′ end and was cloned in pUC18 (pUC18-rMFE(SacXho)) in order to allow the amplification of the fragment (Fig. 2B). pYE352-CTA1 and pUC18-rMFE(SacXho) were digested with SacI and XhoI, and the fragments containing the rat MFE and pYE352 with catalase promoter were isolated from 0.7% agarose gel by Geneclean II kit (Bio 101 Inc., Vista, CA) and ligated overnight. The resulting construct contains the rat MFE open reading frame under the control of oleic acid-inducible catalase promoter, and the YFOX-2 cells were transformed by lithium acetate method(26Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on ura- plates and replica plated on oleic acid plates. Colonies growing on both plates were chosen for complementation studies. UTL-7A, YFOX-2, and YFOX-2-CTA1 strains were used as controls. Yeast cells were cultured at 30°C in the following media: 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose (YPD); 2% glucose, 0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.2% dropout powder without uracil (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Albright L. Coen D. Vorki A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Salt solution (as expressed per liter) was as follows: 125 g of (NH4)2SO4, 25 g of KH2PO4, 12.5 g of MgSO4•7 H2O, 2.5 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of CaCl2, 10 mg of ZnSO4•H2O, 1 mg of CuSO4•5 H2O, 10 mg of MnSO4•H2O, 2.5 mg of KI, 8.3 mg of FeCl3•6 H2O, 12.5 mg of H3Bo3, 5.9 mg of Na2MoO4•H2O. Vitamin solution (per liter) was as follows: 200 mg of thiamine, 200 mg of nicotinic acid, 200 mg of calcium pantothenate, 200 mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride, 100 mg of p-aminobenzoic acid, 100 mg of riboflavin, 1 mg of biotin, 1 mg of folic acid, 1 g of myo-inositol. Single colonies from YPD or ura- plates were grown overnight in YPD (UTL-7A) and in SC-ura (YFOX-2-rMFE). 1-liter batches of YPD medium (UTL-7A), SC-ura (YFOX-2-rMFE), oleic acid medium with uracil (UTL-7A), and oleic acid medium without uracil (YFOX-2-rMFE) were inoculated with overnight cultures to cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and grown at 30°C with shaking for 48 h. The cells were harvested by centrifuging (2000 × g for 10 min), washed twice with sterile distilled water, and centrifuged as above. The strains were grown in liquid cultures, and the REX total RNA isolation kit from USB (Cleveland, OH) was used for isolating total RNA from 0.5 g of yeast cells from each culture. 10-μg samples of each RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-agarose (0.8%) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was hybridized with random prime labeled rat MFE probe. For immunoblot analysis the harvested cells were broken with glass beads, and the lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting on a nitrocellulose filter. The rat MFE protein was immunodetected with rabbit anti-rMFE and using affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG with horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) as second antibody. 2-Enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 activity was measured in the direction of hydration of trans-2-decenoyl-CoA to L-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA. The incubation mixture consisted of 60 nmol of trans-2-decenoyl-CoA in 50 μM Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, 50 μmol of potassium chloride, 1 μmol of NAD+, 5 μg of porcine L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Sigma) in a volume of 1 ml at 23°C. The reaction was started by adding a sample into the cuvette and monitored by following the NADH production spectrophotometrically. 2-Enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 activity was measured in the direction of hydration of trans-2-decenoyl-CoA to D-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA under the conditions described above except that the L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was replaced with 0.5 μmol × min-1 of D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity (determined with D-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA). For measuring the L-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, 60 μmol of a racemic mixture of D,L-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA was incubated in the Tris/HCL/bovine serum albumin/potassium chloride mixture (see above) containing 25 μM magnesium chloride, 1 μM sodium pyruvate, 10 μg of lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of recombinant D-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. After the D-isoform was removed, the reaction was initiated by adding the sample. When assaying the D-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, the L-isoform of the substrate was first removed from the reaction mixture with the L-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase followed by adding the sample. The oxidation of 3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA was followed by monitoring the formation of magnesium-3-ketodecanoyl complex at 303 nm(18Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fosså A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Google Scholar, 28Hiltunen J.K. Palosaari P.M. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13536-13540Google Scholar, 29Malila L.H. Siivari K.M. Mäkelä M.J. Jalonen J.E.

Recombinant D-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was a truncated version of the peroxisomal MFE from Candida tropicalis, and it was produced as described by Hiltunen et al.(18Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fosså A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Google Scholar). Stereospecificities of L- and D-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases have been tested separately using synthetized L- and D-isoforms of 3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA, which were obtained as described by Malila et al.(29Malila L.H. Siivari K.M. Mäkelä M.J. Jalonen J.E. Latipää P.M. Kunau W.-H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21578-21585Google Scholar). UTL-7A and FOX-2-rMFE cells were grown on oleic acid, and the pelleted cells were fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde, processed, and immunolabeled as described by Sormunen et al.(30Sormunen R. Eskelinen S. Lehto V.-P. Lab. Invest. 1993; 68: 652-662Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-rMFE IgG bound on cell sections was localized with protein A-colloid gold labeling technique. All yeast strains tested (UTL-7A, YFOX-2, YFOX-2-CTA1, and YFOX-2-rMFE) were viable (Fig. 3) on glucose-rich YPD plates, whereas on oleic acid plates only YFOX-2-rMFE and wild-type UTL-7A cells were able to grow. In a control experiment on ura- plates, only the strains transformed with pYE352-rMFE or pYE352-CTA1 were viable (data not shown). Altogether, these results indicate that apparent complementation of fox-2 mutation by the rat MFE encoded by the plasmid pYE352-rMFE had occurred. To investigate further the expression of rat MFE in YFOX-2-rMFE, Northern blot analysis was carried out. The rat MFE cDNA probe hybridized only with the RNA isolated from YFOX-2-rMFE cells grown in oleic acid medium, the size of the signal (2.2 kb) corresponding well with the estimated size of the rat MFE RNA (25Osumi T Ishii N. Hijikata M. Kamijo K. Ozasa H. Furuta S. Miyazawa S. Kondo K. Inoue K. Kagamiyama H. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8905-8910Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). This signal was not seen in lane 3 of Fig. 4A (YFOX-2-rMFE grown in glucose medium), which shows that the CTA1 promoter is a strong glucose-repressible and oleic acid-inducible promoter, which is in agreement with earlier observations(31Hoertner H. Ammerer G. Hartter E. Hamilton B. Rytka J. Bilinski T. Ruis H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 179-184Google Scholar, 32Skoneczny M. Chelstowska A. Rytka J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 297-302Google Scholar). In immununoblot analysis of soluble proteins from the four yeast strains using antibodies against rat MFE, a signal of 78 kDa was obtained only with proteins from YFOX-2-rMFE cells grown in oleic acid medium (Fig. 4B), which corresponds well with the signal obtained with the rat wild-type MFE purified from rat liver(22Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2446-2449Google Scholar). The yeast MFE and the rat peroxisomal MFE are known to catalyze the conversion of trans-2-enoyl-CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoA via hydration and dehydrogenation steps, but the stereochemical courses of the reactions are different; in yeast the events occur via D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, whereas in rat they occur via the corresponding L-form(18Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fosså A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Google Scholar, 28Hiltunen J.K. Palosaari P.M. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13536-13540Google Scholar). This difference was used to design kinetic experiments to distinguish between the two enzymes. As shown in Fig. 5A, when the protein sample from oleic acid-grown UTL-7A cells was added to a racemic mixture of the D- and L-forms of 3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA, only one half of the substrate was converted to 3-ketodecanoyl-CoA. The subsequent addition of L-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from porcine heart resulted in consumption of the second half of the substrate. This indicated that the yeast extract used contained only D-specific hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. This conclusion was further confirmed by the observation that the addition of the recombinant D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (18Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fosså A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Google Scholar) did not result in any additional production of 3-ketoacyl-CoA ester. When the corresponding experiment was carried out with YFOX-2-rMFE rather than wild-type cells, the addition of the cell lysate again caused the removal of only half of the substrate (Fig. 5B), but this time separate additions of the auxiliary enzymes, L-specific and D-specific hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases, yielded opposite effects; the L-specific enzyme caused no reaction, whereas the D-specific one metabolized the remaining half of the substrate. These results clearly demonstrate that the transformed YFOX-2 strain was devoid of its endogenous D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity but possessed the expressed L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase of plasmid origin. When soluble proteins were extracted from UTL-7A and YFOX-2-rMFE yeast strains grown on glucose and oleic acid media and the samples were tested for combined activity (i.e. capability to convert trans-2-decenoyl-CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoA), activity was observed within the detection limits only in oleic acid-grown cells (Table 2).TABLE II Open table in a new tab When enzyme activities participating in 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA metabolism were studied in more detail, activities of 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 and D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase could be detected in extracts of UTL-7A cells grown on oleic acid (Table 2). Similarly, the combined activity (rate of metabolism of trans-2-decenoyl-CoA to 3-ketoacyl-CoA) was also present. Furthermore, in UTL-7A extracts the activities of 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase were below the detection limits in the assay system used. The extracts from YFOX-2-rMFE cells contained both 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities but were lacking D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity. Unexpectedly, about 42% of hydratase 2 activity was still detectable when compared with the wild-type cells. Because it has been shown earlier that the mRNA for FOX-2p (yeast peroxisomal MFE) is not produced in YFOX-2 cells, this result indicates that in addition to FOX-2p there exists another protein capable of catalyzing hydratase 2 reactions in yeast. Interestingly, recent data have shown that in rat liver hydratase 2 activity can be found in two subcellular compartments: peroxisomes and microsomes(29Malila L.H. Siivari K.M. Mäkelä M.J. Jalonen J.E. Latipää P.M. Kunau W.-H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21578-21585Google Scholar). To study the subcellular location of rat MFE expressed in YFOX-2 cells, immunoelectron microscopy was carried out applying protein A colloid gold technique and using anti-rMFE antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6, most of the gold particles were found within peroxisomes in YFOX-2-rMFE cells grown on oleic acid in contrast to wild-type cells, for which no labeling was found with the same procedure. This implies that the targeting signal for rMFE is recognized by the yeast import mechanism. Present work provides several lines of evidence that the rat peroxisomal MFE can be heterologously expressed in an active form in S. cerevisiae and that it complements the lack of the corresponding endogenous yeast peroxisomal MFE. (i) Both the mRNA and the rat protein were detected only in cells transformed with plasmid pYE352-rMFE. (ii) The transformants had gained 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities, which were undetectable in wild-type yeast cells. (iii) Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that the rat MFE was targeted into the peroxisomes. (iv) Finally, the expression of rat peroxisomal MFE allows the YFOX-2 mutant cells to utilize oleic acid as a carbon source. The observed functional complementation, however, results in the change of stereochemistry of the second (hydration) and the third (oxidation) reactions of β-oxidation (Fig. 1), namely from D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dependent pathway to L-3-hydroxy intermediate-dependent one. Consequently, the results indicate that the functioning of the β-oxidation pathway in S. cerevisiae is independent of the stereochemistry of its second and third reactions. This gives rise to the question of why two chirally different β-oxidation pathways are found in higher and lower eukaryotes. The simplest explanation, that both were present in a phylogenetic ancestor, is contradicted by the fact that only one type of MFE has been found in eubacteria(33DiRusso C.C. J.

It is more likely that this original MFE was replaced by a new one (hydratase 1/L-specific 3-hydoxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase by hydratase 2/D-specific 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) in the fungi after the bifurcation of animals and fungi. Thus the results suggest that the acquisition of enzymes for a metabolic pathway was based on the executing of a certain function and not on the stereochemical course of the events. Following this principle, the evolution of β-oxidation pathways has resulted in a special type of functional convergence in that the MFEs from yeast and mammalian peroxisomes catalyze the same two sequential reactions but via reciprocal stereochemistry. β-Oxidation systems are usually visualized as forming an organized structure in order to provide efficient flux through the many sequential reactions of their pathways(39Srere P.A. Sumegi B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 446-450Google Scholar, 40Nada M.A. Rhead W.J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Roe C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 530-535Google Scholar). It therefore seems surprising at first sight that a phylogenetically unrelated heterologous protein can efficiently replace one endogenous component of this metabolon. It cannot be excluded, however, that the two multifunctional proteins of rat and fungal peroxisomes may be related in terms of their three-dimensional structure. If this turns out to be true in the future, it will mean that in addition to functional convergence, structural convergence must also have occurred. We thank A. Holappa, R. Pietilä, I. Vuoti, and U.

As hGM-CSF receptor (hGMR) does not contain a consensus sequence for binding of PI 3-kinase, hGMR must use a distinct mechanism for its association with and activation of PI 3-kinase. Here, we describe the identification of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 76-85 kDa (p80) that associates with the common β subunit of hGMR and with the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in hGM-CSF-stimulated cells. Src/Yes and Lyn were tightly associated with the p80•PI 3-kinase complex, suggesting that p80 and other phosphotyrosyl proteins present in the complex were phosphorylated by Src family kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 was only detected in hGM-CSF or human interleukin-3-stimulated cells, suggesting that activation of p80 might be specific for signaling via the common β subunit.

Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI 3-kinase) is one of the immediate cellular responses to stimulation by growth factors and cytokines, including hGM-CSF (17-2O). PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits: an 85-kDa protein containing SH2 and SH3 domains (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110)(21Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R.

In most cases, this is mediated by binding of the SH2 domains of p85 to the pYXXM consensus motif in activated tyrosine kinase receptors (25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T.

However, the hGMR does not have this consensus sequence for PI 3-kinase binding nor the recognition motif pYVXV that has been recently described for binding of PI 3-kinase to the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor(27Ponzetto C.

A variation of the direct association of PI 3-kinase with receptor molecules is its indirect binding to activated receptors through a tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor substrate like the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). After insulin receptor stimulation and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associates through its SH2 domains with tyrosine phosphorylation sites within pYMXM motifs on IRS-1(28Sun X.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Google Scholar) also associate with IRS-1. Therefore, the role of IRS-1 is to function as a multiside docking protein to link the upstream insulin receptor to several downstream adapter molecules of different signaling pathways, including the PI 3-kinase. Another PI 3-kinase adapter protein is the IL-4 receptor substrate 4PS, which links the activated IL-4 receptor to PI 3-kinase (32Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Paul W. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Google Scholar). Here, we describe the identification of a new PI 3-kinase adapter protein of 80 kDa (p80), which is the major tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate in hGM-CSF-stimulated cells. p80 coprecipitates with the common β subunit and binds directly to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Our data suggest that p80 is a new adapter protein, which may participate in linking the activated hGM-CSF receptor to the PI 3-kinase pathway.

BAC1.2F5 cells were maintained in α minimal essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 36 ng of human recombinant CSF-1 (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA) per ml. Rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) CRS1, directed against the β subunit of hGMR, has been previously described (37Watanabe Y. Kitamura T. Hayashida K. Miyajima A. Blood. 1992; 80: 2215-2220Google Scholar) and was obtained from Atsushi Miyajima; a rabbit serum directed against the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); rabbit antisera directed against Shc and Jak2, and mAb directed against phosphotyrosine were obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY); rabbit antisera directed against Src (SRC2), Lyn (lyn44), and Hck peptides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.

TF-1 cells were starved for 18 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma) at a cell density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were then resuspended in fresh medium containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at a cell density of 1 × 107 cells/ml, treated for 30 min with 50 μM sodium orthovanadate (Aldrich), and were then incubated for 2 min at 37°C in the absence or presence of 25 ng/ml hGM-CSF unless otherwise indicated. After incubation, cells were diluted into cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μM sodium orthovanadate, and cell lysates were prepared as described below. The stimulation of BAC1.2F5 cells with 35 ng/ml CSF-1 and stimulation of pCO12-EGFR cells with 100 ng/ml EGF were carried out as described previously(39Areces L.B. Dello Sbarba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Google Scholar). Untreated or hGM-CSF treated cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 2% (v/v) Trasylol (FBA Pharmaceuticals, New York)). In some experiments, 10 mM CHAPS (Pierce) was used instead of Nonidet P-40, as indicated in the figure legends. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer (Bio-Rad), and cell lysates were stored in liquid nitrogen until used. Equal amounts of protein were used for electrophoretic analysis. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis were carried out as described previously(39Areces L.B. Dello Sbarba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Google Scholar). Filters were developed using the ECL system according to the manufacturer (Amersham). For reprobing, bound antibodies were removed from the nitrocellulose membrane by incubation in stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50°C. Stripped filters were washed five times for 10 min in TTBS before blocking and incubation with other antibodies. The same filter was used up to four times. pGEX-3X control and pGEX-fusion proteins were induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, the induced bacteria were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and the induced proteins were adsorbed with glutathione-agarose (Sigma) as described previously(39Areces L.B. Dello Sbarba P. Jücker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Google Scholar). TF-1 cells were serum-starved for 18 h, stimulated for 2 min with 50 ng/ml human GM-CSF, lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20 (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) or with anti-p85 mAb (UBI) as described above. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM sodium vanadate and 1% Nonidet P-40, two times in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, with 0.5 M LiCl, once in TNE (10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA), and once with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6. PI 3-kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was measured by its ability to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol to yield phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate as described previously(40Gutkind S. Lacal P.M. Robbins K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3806-3809Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was visualized by autoradiography for the times indicated in the figure legends. To identify the phosphotyrosine proteins that are involved in hGM-CSF signaling we analyzed lysates of human GM-CSF-stimulated TF-1 cells by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, treatment of TF-1 cells with hGM-CSF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 51, 56, 68, 80, 89, 92, 125, 130, 140, and 150 kDa. Tyrosine phosphorylation occurred within 30 s, reached a maximum between 2 and 5 min, and declined rapidly thereafter (Fig. 1A). The induction of tyrosine phosphorylation by hGM-CSF was concentration dependent, with a maximal effect at 5 ng/ml (Fig. 1B). The major induced tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was a broad band of 76-85 kDa, which we have designated p80 (Fig. 1A, lanes 2-4). p80 is also the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein after stimulation of TF-1 cells with human IL-3 (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Both hIL-3 and hGM-CSF induced an indistinguishable pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 1C), consistent with the idea that the common β subunit, which is shared between the receptors for human IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF, is a major determinant of signaling events induced by these cytokines. To determine whether phosphotyrosyl p80 binds to the common β subunit, we analyzed immunoprecipitates of the β subunit for the presence of p80. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis showed that after hGM-CSF stimulation, p80 coprecipitated with the β subunit (Fig. 2, lane 2), suggesting that p80 can directly or indirectly associate with the common β subunit. Since p80 was in the molecular weight range of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1, A-C) and PI 3-kinase activity is stimulated by hGM-CSF(17Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Google Scholar), we analyzed whether this phosphorylated protein was the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Anti-p85 antibodies precipitated a phosphotyrosyl protein that comigrated with p80 (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). However, stripping of the filter shown in Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4, and reprobing with anti-p85 antibodies showed that p80 had a different electrophoretic mobility than the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, our data indicate that p80 is not the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase but that p80 associates with p85 after hGM-CSF stimulation. To characterize the interaction between p80 and p85, we examined whether this association was mediated through phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions. To examine this question, the C-terminal and N-terminal SH2 domains of p85 were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in bacteria. Immobilized C-terminal (SH2-C) and N-terminal (SH2-N) SH2 domains of the p85 subunit bound phosphorylated p80, and this association was dependent on stimulation with hGM-CSF (Fig. 3A, lanes 5-8). The C-terminal SH2 domain had higher affinity for p80 than the N-terminal SH2 domain (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 8). In addition to p80, two other phosphotyrosyl proteins with apparent molecular masses of 110 and 130 kDa were bound to the C- and N-terminal SH2 domains, respectively (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 8, respectively). None of these proteins were recognized by a glutathione S-transferase vector protein (Fig. 3A, lane 9). The association of p85 with p80 followed the same time course as the tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 (Fig. 3C and 1A), suggesting that p80 associated with p85/PI 3-kinase primarily through phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions. However, at the present time we cannot rule out the possibility that p80 was already associated with p85 before hGM-CSF stimulation through other interactions not involving phosphotyrosine. This will be clarified when antibodies to p80 become available. Stimulation of cells with other growth factors that also stimulate PI 3-kinase activity, namely CSF-1 and EGF did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 or its association with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3D). Instead, p85 coprecipitated with an unknown tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 110 kDa in CSF-1-stimulated BAC1.2F5 cells (Fig. 3D, lane 6), and, as previously shown(20Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 981-990Google Scholar), p85 coprecipitated with activated EGF receptor in EGF-stimulated pCO12-EGFR cells (Fig. 3D, lane 10). We conclude that after hGM-CSF stimulation, p80 becomes rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine and associates with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase by binding preferentially to the C-terminal SH2 domain of p85. Thus, p80 represents a novel signaling molecule that is capable of interacting with the p85 adapter protein in cells stimulated with hGM-CSF. Since hGM-CSF induced an association of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase with tyrosine-phosphorylated p80, we wanted to determine if this was accompanied by PI 3-kinase activation. Fig. 4 shows that hGM-CSF caused the appearance of PI 3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from stimulated TF-1 cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2) and that this was a fraction of the PI 3-kinase activity that was constitutively associated with p85 in the absence of hGM-CSF stimulation (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). The correlation between appearance of PI 3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates and the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated p80 to p85 and the hGMR β subunit further supports our model in which p80 links the hGMR to the PI 3-kinase pathway. Several tyrosine kinases have been implicated in hGM-CSF-signaling. These include Jak2(13Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8429-8433Google Scholar, 14Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Google Scholar), Src family kinases(16Torigoe T. O'Connor R. Santoli D. Reed J.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 617-624Google Scholar, 17Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Google Scholar), and Fps/Fes(15Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Google Scholar). To identify the tyrosine kinases that might be involved in phosphorylation of p80, we analyzed which tyrosine kinases were present in the p80•PI 3-kinase complex. In preliminary experiments, we found that p60c-src, p62c-yes, and p53/p56lyn were expressed in TF-1 cells (data not shown). We then used an anti-Src antibody (SRC2) raised against residues 509-533 in the C-terminal region of human p60c-src, which cross-reacts with p62c-yes and p59fyn, for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation of TF-1 lysates with anti-SRC2 antibodies resulted in precipitation of two proteins of 60 and 62 kDa (Fig. 5A), which were identified in separate gels as p60c-src and p62c-yes, respectively (data not shown). To analyze whether p80 and other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins coprecipitated with p60c-src and/or p62c-yes, we reprobed the same filter with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. This analysis showed that after hGM-CSF stimulation, phosphotyrosyl proteins of 51, 56, 68, 76-85, 140, and 160 kDa were present in the anti-SRC2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5B). The broad band of 76-85 kDa in anti-SRC2 precipitates from hGM-CSF-stimulated cells (Fig. 5B) had the same electrophoretic mobility as p80, suggesting that p80 may be a substrate of p60c-src and/or p62c-yes. The 51-, 56-, and 68-kDa proteins (Fig. 5B) had the same electrophoretic mobility as the three isoforms of the adapter protein Shc, p46shc, p52shc, and p66shc(41Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Google Scholar). Stripping and reprobing of the filter with anti-Shc antibodies confirmed that p52shc (Fig. 5C) and p66shc (observed after long exposure) were present in anti-SRC2 immunoprecipitates from hGM-CSF-stimulated cells. Whether p46shc is also in the anti-SRC2 precipitate could not be ascertained because the IgG band interfered with detection of p46shc. Since p80 associates with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 3), the filter shown in Fig. 5, A-C, was reprobed with anti-p85 antibodies to determine if p85 was also present in this complex. As shown in Fig. 5D, similar amounts of p85 were present in anti-SRC2 precipitates from unstimulated and stimulated TF-1 lysates. Thus, one or more Src kinases were associated with p85 before hGM-CSF stimulation. Recent reports that Src family kinases can associate with p85 in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner (42Liu X. Marengere L.E. Koch C.A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5225-5232Google Scholar, 43Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Google Scholar) are consistent with the idea that p60c-src and/or p62c-yes may be already complexed with p85 before hGM-CSF stimulation. p80 also associated with p53/p56lyn in a hGM-CSF-dependent manner. As shown in Fig. 6, the time course of p80 association with Lyn was similar to the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 (Fig. 1A). Since p53/p56lyn are not recognized by the anti-SRC2 antibody, these data indicate that at least two members of the Src family, i.e. p53/p56lyn and p60c-src and/or p62c-yes, associate with p80. Therefore, these kinases are very strong candidates for phosphorylation of p80 and other phosphotyrosyl substrates present in the p80•PI 3-kinase complex (e.g. Shc, p140, p160). The Jak2 tyrosine kinase associates with the β subunit and has been implicated in the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the β subunit(14Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Google Scholar). Since p80 also associates with the β subunit, we analyzed the possibility that p80 is a substrate of Jak2. We confirmed that Jak2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after stimulation of TF-1 cells with hGM-CSF; however, we could not detect p80 in Jak2 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that p80 may not be a direct substrate of Jak2 (data not shown). Similarly, the tyrosine kinase Fps/Fes, which has been implicated in hGM-CSF signaling(15Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K. Mano H. Miyajima A. Arai K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1641-1646Google Scholar), was not present in the p80•PI 3-kinase complex (data not shown), suggesting that p80 was not a substrate of Fps/Fes either. To analyze molecular events involved in hGM-CSF signaling that may also occur in vivo, we have used a human GM-CSF-dependent cell line that responds to physiological concentrations of the ligand. Our experiments resulted in the identification of a new phosphotyrosine protein (p80) that associates with the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase and with the common β subunit of the hGM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor. Activation of PI 3-kinase is one of the immediate cellular responses to stimulation by growth factors and cytokines (18Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Google Scholar, 19Escobedo J.A. Navankasattusas S. Kavanaugh W.M. Milfay D. Fried V.A. Williams L.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 75-82Google Scholar, 20Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 981-990Google Scholar). As previously reported in other cells(17Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Google Scholar), hGM-CSF also caused an increase in PI 3-kinase activity in TF-1 cells, indicating that the PI 3-kinase pathway is involved in hGM-CSF signaling in these cells. PI 3-kinase is a heterodimer consisting of two subunits: an 85-kDa protein containing SH2 and SH3 domains (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110)(21Carpenter C.L. Duckworth B.C. Auger K.R. Cohen B. Schaffhausen B.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19704-19711Google Scholar). p85 functions as an adapter molecule that targets p110 to activated growth factor receptors(19Escobedo J.A. Navankasattusas S. Kavanaugh W.M. Milfay D. Fried V.A. Williams L.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 75-82Google Scholar, 20Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 981-990Google Scholar, 22McGlade C.J.

In most cases, this is mediated by binding of the SH2 domains of p85 to the pYXXM motif in activated receptors. The β subunit of the hGMR does not have this consensus sequence for PI 3-kinase binding (25Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky A. Lechleider R. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Google Scholar) nor the recognition motif pYVXV that has been recently described for binding of PI 3-kinase to the hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor receptor(27Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Maina F. Longati P. Panayotou G. Dhand R. Waterfield M.D. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4600-4608Google Scholar). Therefore, p85 may bind indirectly to the hGMR via a tyrosine-phosphorylated adapter protein. This mechanism has been described for the insulin receptor where upon ligand binding, p85 binds to IRS-1, a major phosphotyrosyl substrate of the insulin receptor(29Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.-H. Batzer A. Vincentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R. Myers Jr., M.J. Backer J.M. Ullrich A. White M.F. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1936Google Scholar, 44Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Google Scholar). Indirect binding of PI 3-kinase has also been reported for a cytokine receptor as well. p85 binds to IL-4 receptor via a tyrosine-phosphorylated adapter protein designated 4PS(32Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Paul W. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Google Scholar). We postulate that p80 is a tyrosine-phosphorylated adapter protein that may link PI 3-kinase to the hGMR directly or indirectly. This is based on the observations that p80 was found in immunoprecipitates of the β subunit of hGMR and that phosphotyrosyl p80 was tightly bound to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Our experiments showed that the C-terminal and N-terminal SH2 domains of p85 recognized phosphorylated p80, strongly suggesting that this protein binds directly to p85 through SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions. The C-terminal SH2 domain of p85 had higher affinity for phosphorylated p80 than the N-terminal SH2 domain, as has been shown for the association between p85 and the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor(45Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Fantl W.J. Williams L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1451-1459Google Scholar). Clarification of the nature of the association between p80 and the β subunit will require further analysis. Phosphorylation of the multiple hGM-CSF-dependent targets probably requires the concerted action of several different protein-tyrosine kinases. Our data suggest that Src family kinases were responsible for phosphorylation of p80 and other phosphotyrosyl substrates in hGM-CSF-stimulated cells. In TF-1 cells, anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates from hGM-CSF-stimulated cells contained tyrosine-phosphorylated p80 (Fig. 6). This is of particular interest because p80 associates with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, and a hGM-CSF-dependent increase in PI 3-kinase activity has been detected in anti-Lyn immunoprecipitates(17Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Google Scholar). In addition, we detected phosphorylated p80 in a complex with Src/Yes (Fig. 5B), and p80 was also phosphorylated in vitro when anti-Src/Yes immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay (data not shown). The Lyn and Yes tyrosine kinases have been proposed to be involved in hGM-CSF signaling on the basis of an increase in their in vitro kinase activity in hGM-CSF-stimulated hematopoietic cells(16Torigoe T. O'Connor R. Santoli D. Reed J.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 617-624Google Scholar, 17Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Google Scholar). In addition to p80, other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected in anti-Src/Yes precipitates, i.e. Shc, p140, and p160, suggesting that these proteins might also be substrates of Src or Yes. p140 is a protein that associates with Shc after stimulation with several cytokines (46Damen J.E. Liu L. Cutler R. Krystal G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Google Scholar) including hGM-CSF (2)M. Jücker and R. A. Feldman, unpublished data. through a new phosphotyrosine binding domain in the N terminus of Shc(47Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Google Scholar). p160 is an unknown protein. Interestingly, while the association of Src and/or Yes with tyrosine-phosphorylated p80, Shc, p140, and p160 was dependent on hGM-CSF, Src/Yes was already associated with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in the absence of hGM-CSF stimulation. Since we did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in hGM-CSF-stimulated cells, the interaction between Src and/or Yes with p85 may not be dependent on SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions. This finding is consistent with recent reports that the SH3 domain of Src kinases binds directly to a proline-rich region of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase(42Liu X. Marengere L.E. Koch C.A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5225-5232Google Scholar, 43Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Google Scholar). The presence of Src kinases in the PI 3-kinase complex before stimulation makes these kinases good candidates for phosphorylation of p80 or other proteins in this complex. We also analyzed other tyrosine kinases for their association with p80. Jak2 was found to be tyrosine phosphorylated after hGM-CSF treatment of TF-1 cells(13Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B. Quelle F.W. Cleveland J.L. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8429-8433Google Scholar, 14Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Google Scholar) .2 However, no tyrosine-phosphorylated p80 was detected in anti-Jak2 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Similarly, no phosphorylated p80 was found in immunoprecipitates of Hck or Fps/Fes from hGM-CSF-stimulated cells (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that these kinases are unlikely to be involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of p80. In summary, we have identified a new adapter protein, p80, that associates with the β subunit of the hGMR and with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. p80 may link the hGMR to the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. So far, tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 seems to be specific for signaling via the common β subunit of the hGM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptors. We are now attempting to clone p80 to clarify its function and mechanism of action in hGM-CSF signaling. We are grateful to Margaret A. Tate for excellent technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2044727082,"Previous studies suggested that interleukin-11 (IL-11) induces the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in mouse 3T3L1 cells. However, the mechanisms by which IL-11 activates MAPK remain elusive. Our present results show that IL-11 promotes the formation of the active GTP-bound form of Ras, suggesting that IL-11 actions may be transduced in part through the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. By immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, we further demonstrate the association of tyrosine phosphoproteins with Grb2, an adaptor protein serving as a key intermediate for Ras activation. These phosphotyrosine-containing proteins have been subsequently identified to be JAK2, Fyn, and Syp. JAK2 and Fyn are transiently associated with Grb2 upon stimulation with IL-11, suggesting that JAK2 and Fyn may be involved in transducing signals from the IL-11 receptor•glycoprotein 130 to the Ras system through Grb2. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-11-induced interactions of JAK2, Fyn, and Grb2 may not only provide a novel mechanism for the activation of the Ras/MAPK system but also indicate cross-talk among diverse signaling pathways.

Taga T. Tsang M. Yasukawa K. Kishimoto T. Yang Y.-C. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2555-2561PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that gp130 associates with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) tyrosine kinase, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated upon IL-11, IL-6, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, or leukemia inhibitor factor stimulation of cells(4Yin T.

Through its SH3 domains, Grb2 constitutively binds a Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing factor (GNRF) like Sos or Cdc25, which activates Ras by replacing Ras-bound GDP with GTP. In the absence of cellular activation, the Grb2•GNRF complex is located in the cytoplasm. Upon activation by growth factors, the SH2 domain of Grb2 binds activated tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors or receptor-associated tyrosine phosphoproteins, thus bringing GNRF to the plasma membrane where Ras is located(9Marshall M.S.

Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Ligand binding leads to EGFR autophosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues. Subsequently, the SH2 domain of Grb2 becomes attached to tyrosine residues of the EGFR, thus relocating Sos to the plasma membrane. In contrast to the EGFR, stimulation of the IR involves two additional proteins, Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1. Upon stimulation with insulin, Shc and insulin receptor substrate-1 become tyrosine-phosphorylated and bind to Grb2 in order to recruit the Grb2•Sos complex to the cell membrane. In marked contrast to receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR and IR, the IL-11 signal transducer gp130 has no kinase domains (3Yin T. Taga T. Tsang M. Yasukawa K. Kishimoto T. Yang Y.-C. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2555-2561PubMed Google Scholar) and needs to activate membrane-associated non-receptor tyrosine kinases for mediating its effects. It is therefore interesting to elucidate which non-receptor tyrosine kinases are recruited by IL-11 to interact with Grb2, hence transducing signals from the activated IL-11 receptor•gp130 complex to the Ras/MAPK pathway. Recombinant human IL-11 (specific activity, 2.5 × 106 units/mg) was generously provided by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10), and affinity-purified anti-gp130 and anti-JAK2 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Affinity-purified anti-Grb2 and anti-Fyn antibodies, together with anti-Fyn monoclonal antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Ras monoclonal antibody (Y13-259) was from Oncogene Science, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Anti-Syp was a gift from Dr. Gen-Sheng Feng (Indiana University School of Medicine). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Corp., and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG was from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). 3T3L1 mouse preadipocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mML-glutamine. Confluent cells were stimulated without or with 500 ng/ml IL-11 at 37°C as indicated under “Results and Discussion.” 500 ng/ml has been determined to be the optimum concentration of IL-11 on 3T3L1 cells from our previous studies(7Yin T. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3731-3738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by placing dishes of attached cells on ice and adding ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mM sodium orthovanadate to the cells. Cells were scraped off the plate, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The cells were then lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Solubilized proteins were collected after centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C) and used for immunoprecipitations with the appropriate antibodies for 4-h incubation at 4°C with rotation. The immune complexes were further incubated with protein A-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h at 4°C with rotation and then washed five times with modified RIPA buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by 12 or 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes. The membranes were then immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies, and antibody-bound proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-rat IgG and ECL (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. GST-Raf (amino acids 51-149) fusion protein and GST alone as a control were freshly prepared for in vitro binding experiments as described(14Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Marshall M.S. Shen R. Mantel C. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25206-25211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3L1 cells were treated in the absence or presence of 500 ng/ml IL-11 at 37°C as indicated under “Results and Discussion.” For in vitro binding studies, glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with bound fusion proteins (approximately 5 μg of fusion protein/binding reaction) were incubated with cell lysates in digitonin lysis buffer (1% digitonin, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4°C for 12-14 h. The beads were washed three times with digitonin lysis buffer before the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Ras. In order to test whether Ras was activated by IL-11, the GST-Raf in vitro binding assay was performed using lysates from unstimulated and IL-11-treated 3T3L1 cells. It has recently been shown that Ras protein interacts directly with GST-Raf in vitro, and the binding of Ras and GST-Raf is dependent on the activation of Ras loaded with GTP rather than GDP(14Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Marshall M.S. Shen R. Mantel C. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25206-25211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the in vitro binding assay of Ras and GST-Raf is suggested to be a useful approach to verify the activation of Ras(14Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Marshall M.S. Shen R. Mantel C. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25206-25211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that IL-11 induces complex formation between Ras and GST-Raf (amino acids 51-149) in vitro (Fig. 1). 3T3L1 cells were treated without or with 500 ng/ml IL-11 for 3 min and lysed with digitonin-containing lysis buffer. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ras (Y13-259) or incubated with GST-Raf fusion protein or GST alone (as a negative control) immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose. The samples were washed, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Ras Ab (Y13-259). As shown inFig. 1, stimulation of 3T3L1 cells with IL-11 had no effect on the protein level of Ras as was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Ras. Ras complexed with GST-Raf fusion proteins in the lysates from IL-11-stimulated 3T3L1 cells, whereas no GST-Raf-associated Ras was detected from unstimulated 3T3L1 cells. These results in conjunction with our previous studies (7Yin T. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3731-3738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that IL-11 signaling is at least in part mediated through the Ras/MAPK pathway. The adaptor protein Grb2 is a key intermediate to facilitate protein-protein interactions and to transduce signals from ligand-activated membrane receptors to the Ras/MAPK pathway. To analyze the pattern of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins associated with Grb2 following IL-11 stimulation, lysates in modified RIPA buffer from IL-11-treated or untreated 3T3L1 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 antibody, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs (4G10). As shown inFig. 2, Grb2 constitutively associated with a tyrosine phosphoprotein with a molecular mass around 75 kDa, and IL-11 stimulation did not seem to affect their association. However, IL-11 induced two more phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of 130 and 60 kDa to complex with Grb2. After IL-11 treatment, the association of these two phosphotyrosine-containing proteins with Grb2 occurred at 1 min, could still be observed at 3 min, and completely disappeared at 7 min. 1 and 7 min are selected to be the two time points of IL-11 treatment for subsequent experiments. The same immunoprecipitates were reblotted with anti-Grb2 to verify the same amount of Grb2 in each immunoprecipitate. The 75-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein was further identified as Syp (data not shown). Syp is a newly discovered protein-tyrosine phosphatase(15Feng G.-S. Hui C.-C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), and the function of its association with Grb2 in IL-11-triggered signal transduction requires further investigation. To identify the 60-kDa Grb2-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Shc. Shc has been shown to complex with Grb2 and activate the Ras signaling pathway upon stimulation with several cytokines(16Matsuguchi T. Salgia R. Hallek M. Eder M. Druker B. Ernst T. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5016-5021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our experiments Shc was not detected in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates from both unstimulated and IL-11-treated 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown). We therefore examined whether Src family tyrosine kinases, including Fyn, Yes, and Src, are possible candidates for this 60-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. Fyn, Yes, and Src have been determined from our previous studies to be the three Src family kinases expressed in 3T3L1 cells (data not shown). As shown inFig. 3A, Fyn was not present in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells. It appeared in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates after cells were stimulated with IL-11 for 1 min and disappeared after cells were exposed to IL-11 for 7 min. Src and Yes could not be detected in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates from either unstimulated or IL-11-treated 3T3L1 cells (data not shown). The reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting confirmed the presence of Grb2 in the anti-Fyn immunoprecipitates after cells were stimulated by IL-11 for 1 min, as shown inFig. 3B. Fyn has a basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation in the unstimulated 3T3-L1 cells. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn was enhanced transiently following IL-11 stimulation (Fig. 3B). Fyn and other Src family kinases have been reported to be associated with signaling molecules, including phospholipase C-Γ2 and PI3-kinase, which phosphorylates the Asp-3 position of phosphatidylinositol in various cytokine signal transduction mechanisms(18Pleiman C. Clark M. Timson G. Winitz S. Coggeshall K. Johnson G. Shaw A. Cambier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5877-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19Prasad K. Janssen O. Kapeller R. Raab M. Cantley L.

Cell. 1993; 72: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that Src family kinases are involved in the regulation of Ras activity. The Ras GTP-activating protein, an important regulator of the Ras function, was found in complexes with v-Src and c-Src and was phosphorylated by activated Src kinase in v-Src- and c-Src-transformed cells(21Brott B.K. Decker S. Shafer J. Gibbs J.B. Jove R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing oncogenic and transformation-defective variants of the Src family kinase p56lck, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Ras GTP-activating protein required the enzymatic activation and myristoylation of p56lck(22Ellis C. Liu X. Anderson D. Abraham N. Veillette A. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 895-901PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the p120cbl protooncogene product has been shown to form a complex with Fyn, Grb2, and PI3-kinase(23Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19141-19150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The association of p120cbl with Fyn and PI3-kinase was markedly increased by T cell activation. In contrast, the association of p120cbl with Grb2 did not change upon T cell activation. Our present results further suggest that Fyn can be recruited to interact with Grb2 following IL-11 stimulation, thus taking a part in transducing signals from the IL-11 receptor•gp130 complex to the Ras pathway. The 130-kDa Grb2-bound tyrosine-phosphorylated protein has a similar molecular weight as the JAK family tyrosine kinases. To test whether Grb2 binds JAK family tyrosine kinases, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Grb2 or anti-JAK2 antibodies, and these immune complexes were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-JAK2 and anti-Grb2. JAK2 can be detected in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates only after cells were stimulated by IL-11 for 1 min but not from control cells or cells that were exposed to IL-11 for 7 min (Fig. 4A). Related to this experiment, Grb2 was present in anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates only after cells were treated by IL-11 for 1 min (Fig. 4B). JAK1 was not detected in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates from both unstimulated and IL-11-treated 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown).Fig. 4B also shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 is transiently induced after IL-11 treatment. Fyn can also be found in anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates after 3T3L1 cells were stimulated by IL-11 (Fig. 4B). The results demonstrate that IL-11 induces Grb2 and Fyn to complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2. JAK kinase activation may result in tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Stat family transcription factors, which were originally described in the interferon system(24Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that JAK2 associates with growth hormone receptor and erythropoietin receptors and is activated by the ligand receptor binding(25Frank S.J. Yi W. Zhao Y. Goldsmith J.F. Gilliland G. Jiang J. Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14776-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar,26Barber D.L. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6506-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It has been reported (4Yin T. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Yang Y.-C. Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 467-472PubMed Google Scholar) and is confirmed in this paper that JAK2 associates with IL-11 signal transducer gp130 (Fig. 4C). By association with gp130 and Grb2, JAK2 appears to play a critical role in transducing signals from the activated IL-11 receptor•gp130 complex to the Ras/MAPK pathway via Grb2. Our experiments further showed that JAK2 associates with Fyn after IL-11 treatment (Fig. 4B). It has been theorized that protein-protein interactions may cause a conformational change in the Src family kinases, thus leading to the activation of the Src family kinases(27Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). JAK2 has also been found to form a complex containing Src and PI3-kinase in response to IL-3 in NIH3T3 cells(28Rao P. Mufson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6886-6893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that JAK2 may associate with and hence activate Fyn after IL-11 stimulation. In summary, our data demonstrate that IL-11 stimulation induces a novel complex formation among JAK2, Fyn, and Grb2. The complex may serve to propagate signals originating from the IL-11 receptor•gp130 or alter the subcellular location of key signaling molecules such as Grb2-bound Ras GNRF. Grb2-complexed GNRFs identified so far are Sos1(29Webb G.C. Jenkins N.A. Largaespada D.A. Copeland N.G. Fernandez C.S. Bowtell D.D. Genomics. 1993; 18: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Sos2 (29Webb G.C. Jenkins N.A. Largaespada D.A. Copeland N.G. Fernandez C.S. Bowtell D.D. Genomics. 1993; 18: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Cdc25(30Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K.E. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell.

Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Our preliminary experiments failed to demonstrate the association between mSos1 and JAK2 or Fyn (data not shown). Further investigations will be required to identify the Grb2-bound GNRF, which is involved in IL-11-induced Ras activation. In addition to providing a novel mechanism that activates the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, IL-11-induced complex formation of Grb2, JAK2, and Fyn may also represent the interactions among JAK/Stat, Ras/MAPK, and other Src family kinase-related signaling pathways. These interactions may result in diverse signaling pathways functioning in concert to dictate different cellular responses. We thank Dr. Gen-Sheng Feng for providing anti-Syp antibody and reading the manuscript, and Dr. Tetsuzo Tauchi for helpful discussion."

This disruption of histone-DNA contacts leading to the release of free DNA is facilitated by the presence of the core histone tails, MgCl2 (5 mM), KCl (60 mM), and temperatures above 0°C. Under reaction conditions that are commonly used to assess trans-acting factor access to nucleosomal DNA, histone-DNA contacts are on the threshold of instability. We demonstrate how dilution of reconstituted nucleosomes containing a TATA box can facilitate TBP access to DNA. We find that reconstituted nucleosome cores containing specific DNA sequences dissociate on dilution. This disruption of histone-DNA contacts leading to the release of free DNA is facilitated by the presence of the core histone tails, MgCl2 (5 mM), KCl (60 mM), and temperatures above 0°C. Under reaction conditions that are commonly used to assess trans-acting factor access to nucleosomal DNA, histone-DNA contacts are on the threshold of instability. We demonstrate how dilution of reconstituted nucleosomes containing a TATA box can facilitate TBP access to DNA. The nucleosome core is a fragile object (van Holde, 1988). Systematic study of the stability of nucleosome cores isolated from the nuclei of somatic cells has determined the temperature, pH, and salt concentrations at which histone-DNA interactions are disrupted (Zama et al., 1978; Gordon et al., 1979; Libertini and Small, 1980; Burch and Martinson, 1980; Burton et al., 1978; Walker and Wolffe, 1984). An important aspect of nucleosome core stability is the sensitivity of histone-DNA interactions to dilution. The fraction of intact nucleosome cores decreases as the total nucleosome concentration is lowered (Stacks and Schumaker, 1979; Lilley et al., 1979; Cotton and Hamkalo, 1981; Eisenberg and Felsenfeld, 1981; Yager and van Holde, 1984; Ausio et al., 1984a, 1984b). This dissociation of nucleosome cores into histones and free DNA under dilute conditions is substantial at physiological ionic strengths. Cotton and Hamkalo(1981) found that more than 20% of the nucleosome cores would dissociate at a concentration of 10 ng/μl at physiological ionic strength over a 2-h period. Lilley et al.(1979) in determining the consequences for nucleosome integrity of association with eukaryotic RNA polymerase II found that “at the low nucleosome concentrations used to achieve enzyme excess for nucleosome transcription experiments, dissociation to free DNA is considerable, irrespective of the presence of polymerase.” More recent work has made extensive application of nucleosome cores reconstituted using defined sequences of DNA (Archer et al., 1991; Chen et al., 1994; Côtéet al., 1994; Hayes and Wolffe, 1992; Imbalzano et al., 1994; Kwon et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1993; Li et al., 1994; Li and Wrange, 1993; Perlmann and Wrange, 1988; Pina et al., 1990; Workman and Kingston, 1992). Radiolabeling of the DNA used in these experiments has facilitated the use of very dilute solutions. In certain instances nucleosome disruption directed by trans-acting factors has been documented (Chen et al., 1994; Côtéet al., 1994; Imbalzano et al., 1994; Kwon et al., 1994; Workman and Kingston, 1992). Most of these experiments make use of reconstituted nucleosomes under dilute conditions ranging from 6 ng/μl (Workman and Kingston, 1992) to 0.1 ng/μl (Imbalzano et al., 1994). Thus it is possible that spontaneous nucleosome disruption might influence the outcome of these experiments. We have examined the integrity of nucleosome cores reconstituted so as to contain the Xenopus borealis 5 S RNA gene. DNA sequences of this type are among those with the highest affinity for the histone octamer (Shrader and Crothers, 1989; Schild et al., 1993). The X. borealis 5 S RNA gene also directs the positioning of the histone octamer with respect to DNA sequence, offering the opportunity to examine the consequences of nucleosome dissociation on the DNase I cleavage of DNA within a positioned nucleosome core (Rhodes, 1985; Hayes et al., 1990). We find that the 5 S nucleosome and other reconstituted nucleosomes dissociate on dilution under the standard binding conditions for transcription factors such as TBP. Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed with a modified Xenopus 5 S RNA gene in which the adenovirus major late promoter TATA box (TATAAAAG) replaces native sequence from -73 to -66 relative to the start site of 5 S RNA gene transcription (+13; see Pruss et al.(1995)). This replacement was obtained by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis of plasmid XP-10 (Wolffe et al., 1986). The construct was digested with EcoRI and RsaI to liberate a 154-bp 1The abbreviation used is: bpbase pair(s). fragment. For Fig. 5 the following constructs were used: a 159-bp DNA fragment that was amplified using polymerase chain reaction from the Xenopus TRβA gene (from +322 to +163 relative to the start site of transcription at +1 (Ranjan et al., 1994)) and a 424-bp DNA fragment obtained by digestion of a plasmid containing two tandem repeats of the X. borealis somatic 5 S RNA gene (pX5S197-2) (Ura et al., 1995). All DNA fragments were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase or Klenow fragment (New England BioLabs) and gel purified. base pair(s). Recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae TBP (Hoffman and Roeder, 1993; Horikoshi et al., 1989) was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as described (Nikolov et al., 1992) except that trypsin cleavage of the histidine-tag was omitted. Recombinant S. cerevisiae TFIIA was a kind gift of Dr. Yoshihiro Nakatani at NIH. Nucleosome core particles were purified from chicken erythrocyte nuclei as described previously (Wolffe and Hayes, 1993). Trypsinized octamers were prepared as described by Wolffe and Hayes(1993). Unless noted, standard buffer conditions for TBP/TFIIA binding to DNA were used throughout. Reconstituted nucleosome core particles were diluted to the desired concentrations in TE (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) in a volume of 7.2 μl before being mixed with the following buffer in 25-μl reactions. The final buffer concentration after mixing was 20 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.8, 5.6 mM dithiothreitol, 12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 3 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, 6% glycerol, 60 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml dGdC. As indicated, both MgCl2 and KCl concentrations were varied for certain experiments while leaving the other buffer conditions unchanged. Mock incubations (as would be required for TBP binding) were typically performed at 30°C for 30 min. The temperature of these incubations was also varied as indicated. Unless otherwise noted, electrophoresis was in 0.7% agarose and 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE is 90 mM acid, 2.5 mM EDTA) for 3 h at 100 V. Reconstituted nucleosome core particles were spun on a 5-20% sucrose gradient in TE plus 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (20 h at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 41 rotor) to remove unreconstituted DNA. These were treated as described above, scaling up 7-fold. Following incubation, samples were digested with DNase I at a concentration of 12 μg/ml for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with a 2-fold excess of EDTA, made 0.25% SDS and 0.3 M NaAc, and extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform alone prior to precipitation. Electrophoresis was on a 6% denaturing gel (Hayes et al., 1990). We first examined the stability of nucleosome cores that contained a modified 5 S rRNA gene into which the adenovirus major late TATA box (TATAAAAG) had been inserted (see “Materials and Methods”). The TATA box was positioned 81 bp from the dyad axis of the nucleosome core (Pruss et al., 1995). Control digestions with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease, which determine the rotational and translational position of DNA relative to the histone octamer, confirmed that these were unchanged from those obtained with the wild type X. borealis 5 S rRNA gene (see Fig. 2). 2J. S. Godde and A. P. Wolffe, manuscript in preparation. Our binding conditions were optimized to facilitate the association of yeast TBP and TFIIA with the TATA box in naked DNA (Fig. 1, lane 2) (Horikoshi et al., 1989, 1992; Buratowski et al. 1989; Maldonado et al., 1990). Ionic conditions were 20 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.8, 12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5.6 mM dithiothreitol, 60 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml dGdC, 3 mM MgCl2, 60 mM KCl, and 6% glycerol. Addition of reconstituted nucleosome cores (see “Materials and Methods”) to this solution at progressively lower concentration leads to the progressive dissociation of the nucleosomes as revealed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1, lanes 3-5). Note that because of dilution a smaller mass of DNA and hence radioactivity is loaded in lane 5 compared with lane 3. At 3 ng/μl, histone octamer-associated DNA exceeds free DNA by ~3-fold (determined from the PhosphorImager), whereas at 1 ng/μl, free DNA exceeds histone octamer-bound DNA by more than 2-fold (Table 1). Thus the relative proportions of nucleosomal compared with free DNA change significantly simply through adjustment of concentration. Control experiments indicated that DNA was not being lost through nonspecific association with the reaction tube. These involve measuring the low levels of radioactivity associated with the reaction tube after the sample had been loaded on the gel or most simply by removal of the solution from the tube following the dilution process and measuring any residual radioactivity in the tube by scintillation counting.Figure 1:Nucleosome disruption and TBP binding. Nucleosome core particles at the indicated concentrations (per μl) were incubated in the presence and absence of TBP and TFIIA. Lanes 1 and 2 contain naked DNA; lanes 3-8, core particles; and lanes 9 and 10, core particles from which the histone tails have been removed by trypsin (TrypOct) (see “Materials and Methods”). Lanes 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 are with the addition of TBP and TFIIA to 1 × 10-7M. Nucleoprotein complexes and free DNA are indicated. Oct, octamer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TABLE I Open table in a new tab We next examined the binding of TBP and TFIIA to free and nucleosomal DNA. The TBP/TFIIA proteins bind to the TATA box within naked DNA but not to the TATA box when it is associated with an unmodified octamer of histones (Fig. 1, lanes 6-8). Incubation of nucleosomes with TBP/TFIIA under progressively more dilute conditions leads to a progressively larger proportion of TBP/TFIIA bound to naked DNA appearing with dilution (Fig. 1, lanes 6-8Table 1). This is because histone-DNA contacts are selectively disrupted on dilution. Thus a potential contributory factor in the access of TBP to nucleosomal DNA (Imbalzano et al., 1994) could be the dissociation of nucleosomes at high dilution. Imbalzano et al.(1994) use reconstituted nucleosomes at a very low concentration of 0.1 ng/μl. As a control for the capacity of our gel system to resolve a tertiary complex of histones, TBP/TFIIA, and DNA, we examined the binding of TBP/TFIIA to nucleosomal particles from which the core histone tails had been removed using trypsin (“tail-less nucleosomes”). Earlier work had indicated that the major impediment to TFIIIA access to DNA in a nucleosome containing the X. borealis 5 S rRNA gene was the interaction of the core histone tails with DNA (Lee et al., 1993). TBP/TFIIA efficiently forms a tertiary complex with the tail-less nucleosome containing the TATA box (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 10). Thus the core histone tails impede TBP/TFIIA access to nucleosomal DNA under these conditions. A concern in this type of analysis is that gel electrophoresis might introduce a potential artifact. Nucleosomes might dissociate upon entry into the gel. An experiment that might verify or eliminate any gel dissociation artifact is to carry out a DNase I footprinting cleavage, followed immediately by separation into free DNA and nucleosomes on a non-denaturing gel (Wolffe and Hayes, 1993). The different bands can then be assayed for cleavage pattern after elution and deproteinization in a denaturing gel. If the “free DNA” is really free, then it should show no 10-11-bp periodicity in cleavage. Such a 10-11-bp periodicity in cleavage might reflect a nucleosomal organization in solution that is lost on electrophoresis. We carried out this experiment using nucleosomal DNA in dilute solution (1 ng/μl) and found that “free DNA” in the gel was cleaved by DNase I without any 10-11-bp periodicity, i.e. it is digested as naked DNA (Fig. 2A, lane 1). In contrast, nucleosomal DNA isolated from the native gel showed a clear 10-11-bp periodicity of cleavage (Fig. 2A, lane 2). This result suggests that nucleosomes do not dissociate during electrophoresis under our experimental conditions. It should also be noted that there is little smearing of nucleosomal DNA, reflecting the continued stability of the complex once it has entered the gel matrix. A feature of nucleosomal disruption by the yeast or human SWI/SNF complexes is the loss of DNase I cleavage patterns characteristic of the nucleosome (Côtéet al., 1994; Imbalzano et al., 1994). Consistent with earlier data on mixed sequence nucleosomes (Ausio et al., 1984a, 1984b) and the 5 S nucleosome containing a TATA box (Fig. 1), dilution of nucleosomes will contribute to their disruption. In fact, DNase I cleavage of reconstituted nucleosomes incubated under progressively more dilute conditions leads to the progressive loss of protection from DNase I cleavage (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-4). In the earlier published experiments (Côtéet al., 1994; Imbalzano et al., 1994) nucleosomes are not isolated from native gels following DNase I cleavage (Wolffe and Hayes, 1993); thus mixed populations of free DNA and histone-bound DNA might complicate interpretation of the experimental results. Moreover, the efficiency of reconstitution into nucleosomes might vary with DNA template; for example Shrader and Crothers(1989) report wide variation in the stability of DNA-histone interactions. Without examining nucleoprotein complexes on native gels or by analytical ultracentrifugation it is almost impossible to determine reconstitution efficiencies. We suggest that it is important to control for nucleosome dissociation under the dilution conditions used in in vitro experiments when assessing trans-acting factor access to nucleosomal DNA or the disruption of nucleosomes by molecular complexes such as SWI/SNF. Rigorous earlier work had made use of analytical ultracentrifugation to determine the thermodynamic parameters governing nucleosome dissociation using nucleosome core particles containing a mixture of DNA sequences (Ausio et al., 1984a, 1984b). Ausio and colleagues also presented a thermodynamic analysis of the existing data on this topic (Stacks and Schumaker, 1979; Cotton and Hamkalo, 1981; Ausio et al., 1984a, 1984b). Our results are in general agreement with this careful analysis. Here we have also examined more qualitative aspects of nucleosome dissociation using reconstituted nucleosome cores containing the X. borealis 5 S rRNA gene. We have investigated the role of the core histone tails and MgCl2 concentration, parameters that influence transcription factor binding (Lee et al., 1993; Vettesse-Dadey et al., 1994) but that had not been the focus of previous studies. We present our results as gel retardation assays that separate histone-bound from free DNA (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Nucleosome cores containing the histone tails are less stable to dilution than cores from which the histone tails have been removed by trypsin (Fig. 3A). The tail-less octamers remain stable if MgCl2 concentrations are increased from 0 to 5 mM (Fig. 3B). In contrast, nucleosome cores in which the histone tails are present are progressively destabilized by an increase in MgCl2 concentration from 0 to 5 and 12 mM (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-5, Table 2). Thus the histone tails and MgCl2 concentration will significantly influence the stability of histone-DNA interactions at dilutions of nucleosomes commonly used in transcription factor binding experiments.Figure 4:Effect of MgCl2 concentration, temperature, and KCl concentration on the disruption of nucleosomes. A, MgCl2 concentration was varied from 0 mM (lanes 1-5) to 5 mM (lanes 6-10) to 12 mM (lanes 11-15) with KCl concentration and temperature held constant as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, temperature of incubation was changed from 0°C (lanes 1-5) to 25°C (lanes 6-10) to 37°C (lanes 11-15) with MgCl2 and KCl concentrations held constant. C, KCl concentration was varied between 70 and 280 mM as indicated. MgCl2 concentration was held at 5 mM, and the temperature was 30°C. Histone-bound and free DNA are indicated. Bar indicates the population of nucleosome cores to which a second histone octamer is bound (Ausio et al., 1984a, 1984b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TABLE II Open table in a new tab Our next experiments examined the role of temperature and KCl concentration in nucleosome dissociation. In agreement with earlier work (Ausio et al., 1984b) we find that an increase in temperature to 37°C and monovalent cation concentration (KCl) to 280 mM further destabilizes nucleosome cores (Fig. 4, B and C). An increase in divalent or monovalent cation concentrations will contribute to the release of the core histone tails from stable interaction with nucleosomal DNA (Walker, 1984). This release might facilitate nucleosome disruption, potentially by allowing the tails to make contacts outside of the nucleosome. In these studies we have also found an example of two octamers bound to a single DNA fragment (Fig. 4C, lanes 1, 5, and 9) as previously reported (Ausio et al., 1984a, 1984b). The upper complex is selectively destabilized by dilution, reflecting the weaker association of the second histone-octamer with DNA (Ausio et al., 1984b). Finally we made use of two additional specific chromatin substrates to show that a mononucleosome containing sequences from the Xenopus TRβA promoter (Ranjan et al., 1994) 3J. Wong, Y.-B. Shi, and A. P. Wolffe, manuscript in preparation. (Fig. 5, lanes 1-5) and a dinucleosome containing two reiterated 5 S rRNA genes (Ura et al., 1995) are also destabilized by dilution (Fig. 5, lanes 6-10). These results are indicative of the generality of this nucleosome disruption phenomenon (Stacks and Schumaker, 1979; Cotton and Hamkalo, 1981; Ausio et al., 1984a, 1984b). We describe experiments that make use of standard conditions for examining the binding of trans-acting factors to DNA. Due to the sensitivity of the available gel shift and DNase I footprinting assays, together with inherent limitations in the availability of specific trans-acting factors and potential chromatin remodeling complexes, these assays typically utilize DNA at very low concentrations. We demonstrate here that the concomitant dilution of nucleosomes leads to loss of histone-DNA contacts under conditions that retain the binding of trans-acting factors."
https://openalex.org/W2050564047,"The burial of charged residues in proteins is rare as it is thermodynamically strongly disfavored. However, in “standard mechanism” protein inhibitors of serine proteinases, the P1 residue, which is highly exposed, becomes buried in the S1 specificity pocket of the enzyme. In many enzymes, such as Streptomyces griseus proteinase B (SGPB) the S1 pocket is hydrophobic. We measured the pH dependence of the association equilibrium constant for the interaction of SGPB with turkey ovomucoid third domain P1 mutants, Glu18 OMTKY3 and His18 OMTKY3. In order to eliminate the effects of other ionizable groups on the enzyme and the inhibitor, we divided these pH dependences by the pH dependence of the association equilibrium constant for the Gln18 OMTKY3 mutant. This yielded for Glu18, pKf (free inhibitor) of 4.46 ± 0.05 and pKc (complex) of 8.74 ± 0.06. For His18 the values are pKf 6.63 ± 0.08 and pKc 4.31 ± 0.07. At low pH values Glu18 variant is a relatively good inhibitor for SGPB. This may be biologically relevant."

These responses are similar to our previously reported data on insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression. They are also observed in HeLa cells and are thus not cell type specific. The evidence suggests that the insulin responsiveness of these genes is mediated by an Ets-related transcription factor. First, linker-scanning mutations and/or deletions of the prolactin, somatostatin, and thymidine kinase promoters suggest that their insulin responsiveness is mediated by the sequence CGGA. This sequence is identical with the response element of the Ets-related transcription factors. Second, CGGA-containing sequences placed at -88 in the ΔMTV-CAT reporter plasmid conferred insulin responsiveness to the mammary tumor virus promoter. Third, expression of the DNA-binding domain of c-Ets-2, which acts by blocking effects mediated by Ets-related transcription factors, inhibits the response of these promoters to insulin. Finally, the Ets-related proteins Sap and Elk-1 bind to the prolactin, somatostatin, and thymidine kinase insulin-response elements. An Ets-like element was found in all insulin-sensitive promoters examined and may serve a similar function in those promoters.

An Ets-like element was found in all insulin-sensitive promoters examined and may serve a similar function in those promoters. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression by insulin are not well characterized. Insulin-induced alterations in the steady-state levels of numerous mRNAs have been documented(1Meisler M.H. Howard G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 701-714Google Scholar). For several genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase(2Magnuson M. Quinn P. Granner D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14917-14920Google Scholar), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase(3Nazrin N. Ercolani L. Denaro M. Kong X. Kang I. Alexander M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5273-5277Google Scholar), growth hormone(4Prager D. Yamashita S. Melmed S. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2946-2952Google Scholar), and prolactin(5Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13443-13448Google Scholar), it has been established that these alterations are due to effects of insulin on the rate of transcription and not to effects on mRNA half-life or processing(1Meisler M.H. Howard G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 701-714Google Scholar). The effects of hormones on transcription are mediated through response elements in the promoters of genes. Several response elements may exist for a particular hormone that differs slightly in sequence or orientation, perhaps to allow for fine tuning of the hormonal response or for interaction with different tissue-specific factors. However, these elements are sufficiently similar to be recognized by the hormone-activated transcription factors and are thus said to form a consensus response element. The consensus hormone response element for cAMP-activated genes is the sequence TGACGTCA(6Montminy M. Sevarino K. Wagner J. Mandel G. Goodman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Google Scholar), while the thyroid-retinoid response element is a direct repeat of the sequence AGGTCA with varying numbers of intervening bases that determine hormone receptor specificity(7Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Google Scholar). A specific sequence comprising an insulin response element has been identified only for a small proportion of insulin-responsive genes. Comparison of these insulin response elements has not revealed sequence homologies that could constitute a consensus insulin response element(8Jacob K. Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Google Scholar). The transcription factors that mediate responses to insulin have not been characterized. The putative insulin response element of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was identified by binding of an insulin-regulated protein to a specific sequence in the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. A protein that binds to this sequence has been cloned and is identical to the product of the testis determining gene, SRY(9Nasrin N. Buggs C. Kong X. Carnazza J. Goebl M. Alexander-Bridges M. Nature. 1991; 354: 317-320Google Scholar). However, its role in the activation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene expression by insulin was not further established. We previously identified an insulin response element in the prolactin promoter(8Jacob K. Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Google Scholar). This insulin response element overlaps the cAMP response element of the prolactin gene TGACGGAA. However, mutagenesis and deletional analysis revealed that the insulin response element was separable from the cAMP response element and consisted of a direct repeat of the sequence CGGAAA. This sequence is identical to sequences that bind the Ets family of transcription factors. These studies report the identification of insulin response elements in the somatostatin and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase genes that, together with the previously identified insulin response element of the prolactin gene, define a consensus insulin response element. The consensus sequence is identical to known binding sites for Ets-related transcription factors, and an Ets-factor inhibitor was found to inhibit insulin activation of all three promoters. The Ets-related proteins Sap-1 and Elk-1 specifically bind to these sequences. [32P]dCTP, 3000 Ci/mmol, and [14C]chloramphenicol, 50 mCi/mmol, were obtained from ICN Biochemical Corp.

The construction of pPrl-CAT plasmids containing -173/+75 of prolactin 5′-flanking DNA was described(5Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13443-13448Google Scholar). The vector pBLCAT2 (10Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar) was obtained from G. Schutz (Institut fur Zell- und Tumorbiologie, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany). A plasmid containing the 5′-region of the prolactin gene from the Sprague-Dawley rat was the generous gift of Dr. J. Gorski (University of Wisconsin) (11Weber J.L. Durrin L.K. Gorski J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 65: 171-179Google Scholar). The plasmid (AP1)3 CAT was the gift of Dr. T. Curran (Roche Institute, Nutley, NJ)(12Sonnenberg J. Rauscher III, F. Morgan J. Curran T. Science. 1989; 246: 1622-1625Google Scholar). This plasmid contains three concatamerized AP1 sites from the human metallothionine IIA gene fused to the SV40 early promoter. The α(-846/+44)CAT was from Dr. J. L. Jameson (Case Western Reserve, Cleveland, OH)(13Drust D. Troccoli N. Jameson J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1541-1551Google Scholar). This plasmid contains -846 bp of the human glycoprotein hormone α gene that contains two cAMP response elements. The plasmid Pit-1(-738/+11)CAT, containing two cAMP-responsive sequences (-210/-142), was described previously(14Jong M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1320-1327Google Scholar). Deletion and linker-scanning mutants of the thymidine kinase promoter were a generous gift of Dr. S. L. McKnight (Tularik, South San Francisco)(15McKnight S. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Google Scholar). These were recloned into pUC 8 as described (16Park H.-Y. Davidson D. Raaka B. Samuels H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 319-330Google Scholar). The plasmid TK(-95/+56ΔBamHI)CAT was made by digesting TK(-95/+56)CAT with BamHI to linearize the plasmid at the 5′-end of the thymidine kinase promoter. This was then treated with mung bean nuclease to create flush ends, and the plasmid was recircularized by blunt end ligation. The plasmids TK(-385/+56)CAT, TK(-218/+56)CAT, and TK(-128/+56)CAT were constructed from TK(ls+5/+15ΔBamHI)CAT. First, TK(ls+5/+15)CAT was digested with BamHI, blunt ended with mung bean nuclease, and religated to form TK(ls+5/+15ΔBamHI)CAT. HindIII-AccI (TK(-385/+56)CAT), HindIII-PstI (TK(-218/+56)CAT), and HindIII-NspI (TK(-128/+56)CAT) deletions were made from this plasmid. The plasmids SS(-71/+80)CAT and SS(-48/+80)CAT were gifts of Dr. R. H. Goodman (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR)(6Montminy M. Sevarino K. Wagner J. Mandel G. Goodman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Google Scholar). SS(-71/-1)CAT and SS(-48/-1)CAT were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using the SS(-71/+80)CAT as a template. The universal primer served as the sense primer. The antisense primer used was (5′-GCTCTCGAGCTCTCCACGGTCTCC-3′). This adds an XhoI restriction site at -1 of the somatostatin promoter. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with XbaI (there is an XbaI site in SS(-71/+80)CAT in the polylinker) and XhoI and then ligated into XbaI-XhoI digested and dephosphorylated pBLCAT3. The plasmid SS(-71/+80Etsmut)CAT was prepared by ligating an 82-bp duplex oligonucleotide with G→C point mutations of each of the three potential Ets-response elements in the 5′-untranslated region of the somatostatin gene into the XhoI site of SS(-71/-1)CAT. These mutations converted three GGA motifs into GCA sequences that are not Ets binding sites. The plasmid SS(-71/-1,+23/+80)CAT was made by deleting +1/+22 of SS(-71/+80Etsmut)CAT with XhoI/PstI. This results in a plasmid in which the first two potential Ets-binding sites have been deleted and the third (+43/+46) has a G→C mutation at +45. The plasmid SS(-71/-1,+7/+47)CAT was prepared by ligating a duplex oligonucleotide to the sequence +7/+47 (containing the putative insulin response element) into the XhoI site of SS(-71/-1)CAT. All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. A human insulin receptor expression plasmid, pRT3HIR-2 was generously provided by Dr. J. Whittaker (State University of New York at Stony Brook) (17Whittaker J. Okamoto A.K. Thys R. Bell G.I. Steiner D.F. Hoffman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5237-5241Google Scholar). Electroporation experiments and CAT assays were performed as described(18Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Google Scholar). GH4 cells were plated in DMEM, which contained 10% hormone-depleted, iron-supplemented calf serum(5Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13443-13448Google Scholar), for 24 h and harvested with an EDTA solution, and 20-40 × 106 cells were used for each electroporation. All electroporations contained 5 μg of the plasmid pRT3HIR-2, which expresses high levels of the human insulin receptor(18Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Google Scholar). This is necessary to achieve the high levels of insulin stimulation seen in these studies and is consistent with numerous other systems where cotransfection of receptors has been necessary to achieve physiological regulation of transfected genes(18Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Google Scholar). Trypan blue exclusion before electroporation ranged from 95 to 99%. The voltage of the electroporation was 1550 volts. This gives trypan blue exclusion of 70-80% after electroporation. The transfected cells were then plated in multiwell dishes (Falcon Plastics) at 5 × 106 cells per 9 cm2 tissue culture well in DMEM with 10% hormone-depleted serum. Insulin was added at 1 μg/ml to the appropriate flasks. Cells were refed with DMEM with 10% hormone-depleted serum ± insulin at 24 h. After 48 h, the flasks were washed three times with normal saline and frozen. The cells were harvested in hypotonic lysis buffer using a rubber policeman. CAT enzyme activity was assayed as described(19Flug F. Copp R.P. Casanova J. Horowitz Z.D. Janocko L. Plotnick M. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6373-6382Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts used for gel mobility shift experiments were prepared from GH4 cells as described(20Stanley F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1627-1633Google Scholar). Nuclei were disrupted with 400 mM KCl in a buffer containing 20% glycerol, 25 mM Tris, pH 8, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100. It was then dialyzed and stored at -70 in the same buffer containing 100 mM KCl. Sap-1, Elk-1, and SRF proteins were produced using an in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). The plasmids T7 SAP1A(21Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Google Scholar), T7 ELK 1-428(22Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Google Scholar), and T7 SRF ATG (23Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Google Scholar) were used in the reactions, which were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. The oligonucleotides used for these studies showing the putative Ets-binding sites (underlined) and mutations (lower case) include 1) an oligonucleotide containing the insulin response element of the prolactin promoter (-106/-87) 5′-TCTTAATGACGGAAATAGATG-3′, 2) the putative insulin-responsive area of the somatostatin promoter (-7/-47) 5′-GAAGGAGACGCTACTGGAGTCGTCTCTAGAGCCTGCGGACG-3′, 3) an 82-bp mutant of this sequence (+1/+80 mutated) 5′-GGCGGCTGAAGcAGACGCTACTGcAGTCGTCTCTGCCGCCTGCGcACCTGCGTCTAGACTGACCCACCGCGCTCAAG-3′, 4) the sequence of the wild type thymidine kinase promoter from -22/-2 5′-AAGGTGACGCGTGTGGCCTCG-3′, and 5) the corresponding mutant sequence from the insulin-responsive linker-scanning mutant of the thymidine kinase promoter TK(ls-21/-12)CAT and ΔMTV(TKb)CAT (5′-ccGGatcCGCGTGTGGCCTCG-3′). These were purified on polyacrylamide gels, annealed, and either end labeled with [32P]dCTP or filled in with unlabeled deoxyribonucleotides using the Klenow reaction. These labeled oligonucleotides were then used in gel mobility shift experiments performed as described(20Stanley F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1627-1633Google Scholar). 2 μg of nuclear extract or 2 μl of in vitro transcribed and translated Sap-1 or Elk-1 were incubated at 25°C for 30 min with 10,000 cpm (10-20 fmol) of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. The protein-DNA complexes were then analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer. The observation that the insulin and cAMP response elements of the prolactin gene were composed of overlapping sequences (8Jacob K. Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Google Scholar) suggested that other cAMP-responsive genes might be insulin responsive. A comparison of such sequences might suggest a consensus insulin response element. We therefore tested a number of cAMP-responsive promoter-CAT constructs in GH4 cells to determine if these were also insulin responsive (Fig. 1). The Pit-1(-738/+11)CAT, α(-846/+44)CAT, and (AP1)3CAT are not significantly affected by insulin incubation (Fig. 1). However, somatostatin(-71/+80)CAT expression increased 8-fold in response to insulin, and TK(-95/+56)CAT expression increased 6-fold in response to insulin. Insulin also activates expression of Prl(-173/+75)CAT, SS(-71/+80)CAT, and TK(-95/+56)CAT in HeLa cells (Fig. 2). Low levels of Prl(-173/+75)CAT expression are increased 16-fold in HeLa cells in response to insulin. SS(-71/+80)CAT is increased 10-fold and TK(-95/+56)CAT is increased 4-fold in HeLa cells in response to insulin. As in GH4 cells, the expression of CAT is not increased by insulin using plasmids containing the Pit-1 promoter, glycoprotein hormone α-subunit promoter, or the repeated AP1 element. These data indicate that the effects of insulin to increase transcription of these three genes is not unique to the GH cells. A panel of deletion and linker-scanning mutants was used in GH4 cells to identify the insulin response element of the thymidine kinase promoter. Deletion of 5′ sequences to -46 (TK(-46/+56)CAT, Fig. 3) reduced the insulin-increased expression of CAT to 3-fold but did not eliminate it. The 3′-deletion plasmid TK(-725/-7)CAT (Fig. 3) was stimulated 6-fold by insulin, but the plasmid TK(-725/-16)CAT was not stimulated by insulin. Thus, it appeared that the insulin-responsive sequences were likely located between -46 and -7. However, linker-scanning mutants to this region (TK(ls-46/-36)CAT, TK(ls-42/-32)CAT, TK(ls-28/-18)CAT, TK(ls-21/-12)CAT, and TK(ls-16/-6)CAT) (Fig. 3) showed a loss of insulin-increased CAT expression only with the plasmid TK(ls-28/-18)CAT. This mutation deletes the TATA element and was reported to reduce basal expression from this promoter(15McKnight S. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Google Scholar). Further, this deletion also eliminates the cAMP-mediated increase in thymidine kinase-CAT expression despite the absence of a cAMP response element. For example, the construct TK(ls-7/+3)CAT is stimulated 9.9 ± 2.3-fold by cAMP, while cAMP increases expression only 1.4 ± 0.29-fold using TK(ls-28/-18)CAT. Thus, this sequence does not likely represent the insulin-responsive element of the thymidine kinase gene. Comparison of the thymidine kinase gene with the insulin response element of the prolactin gene identified a sequence at -151/-146 that contained the sequence CCGGAA. This sequence is present in all of the 3′-deletion mutants. The 5′-deletion mutants lack the putative wild type insulin response element, but they all have a BamHI restriction site containing the sequence CGGA at their 5′-ends. The linker used to generate the linker-scanning mutants is also a BamHI restriction sequence that has been shown to act as a response element for the Ets-related transcription factors(24Treisman R. Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4631-4640Google Scholar). If the BamHI site confers insulin responsiveness to the 5′-thymidine kinase-CAT deletion plasmids, then mutation of the BamHI site upstream of -95 in the plasmid TK(-95/+56)CAT should eliminate the insulin responsiveness of this plasmid. This BamHI site (CGGA) is removed in the plasmid TK(-95/+56ΔBamHI)CAT, and CAT expression is not increased by insulin using this reporter (Fig. 3). Thus, the insulin response element of the 5′-deletion mutants is the BamHI linker. To further confirm that the BamHI linker sequence used to make the linker-scanning plasmids was sufficient to mediate the effects of insulin on thymidine kinase-CAT expression, the linker sequence from the plasmid TK(ls-21/-12)CAT between -22 and -2, containing the CCGGAA motif, was cloned into ΔMTV-CAT in both the normal and inverted orientation to create ΔMTV(TKb)CAT and ΔMTV(TKbi)CAT (Fig. 4, top). Insulin did not affect CAT expression from ΔMTV(TKa)CAT and ΔMTV(TKai)CAT that contain the -22/-2 sequence from the wild type thymidine kinase gene in both the normal and inverted orientation (Fig. 4, bottom). In contrast, insulin increases CAT expression 6-fold in ΔMTV(TKb)CAT and ΔMTV(TKbi)CAT that contain the CGGA sequence. The deletion mutants shown in Fig. 5 address the possibility that the insulin response element of the native thymidine kinase promoter is the CCGGAA sequence located at -151/-146. The linker-scanning plasmid TK(ls+5/+15)CAT was used to make 5′-deletions of the thymidine kinase promoter since the 3′-deletion plasmids all have a 3′-CGGA sequence as a result of their construction. First, the BamHI site in the linker was removed with mung bean nuclease to create the plasmid TK(ls+5/+15ΔBamHI)CAT. The remaining plasmid contains the thymidine kinase promoter between -725 and +56. Insulin increases CAT expression 5-fold using this plasmid. Deletion to -385 (TK(-385/+56)CAT, Fig. 5) did not reduce the increase in CAT expression due to insulin. A further deletion to -218 (TK(-218/+15)CAT, Fig. 5) eliminates 5 potential Ets-binding sites including 2 CGGA sequences between -385 and -250, but this did not reduce the insulin-mediated increase in CAT production with this construct. Finally, a deletion to -128 (TK(-128/+56)CAT, Fig. 5), which eliminates the CCGGAA at -151/-147, renders the thymidine kinase promoter insensitive to insulin. Analysis of several deletion constructs suggests that the insulin response element of the somatostatin gene may be located in the 5′-untranslated region (Fig. 6A). Deletion of 5′ sequences to -48 were previously shown to reduce the cAMP responsiveness of this promoter by eliminating part of the cAMP response element(6Montminy M. Sevarino K. Wagner J. Mandel G. Goodman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Google Scholar). However, this deletion had no effect on insulin-increased CAT activity (Fig. 6A, SS(-48/+80)CAT). The 5′-untranslated region of the somatostatin gene is a GA-rich area that contains a CGGA sequence at +43/+46 that was similar to the insulin response element of the prolactin gene and of the insulin-responsive 5′-deletion of the thymidine kinase promoter. A somatostatin-CAT construct lacking this region SS(-71/-1)CAT was not stimulated by insulin (Fig. 6A). When the three potential Ets-binding sites were mutated in the plasmid SS(-71/+80Etsmut)CAT, the increase in CAT expression mediated by insulin was reduced by 75% (Fig. 6B). Deletion of the first two potential Ets-binding sites in the plasmid SS(-71/-1,+23/+80)CAT did not further reduce the effect of insulin (Fig. 6B). This implies that the effect of insulin is predominantly mediated by the CGGA sequence at +43/+46. Finally, the putative insulin response region (+7/+47) of the somatostatin gene was added back to the non-insulin-responsive plasmid SS(-71/-1)CAT to produce the plasmid SS(-71/-1,+7/+47)CAT. This plasmid exhibits a 7-fold increase in response to insulin (Fig. 6B). The DNA-binding domain of the Ets-related transcription factors is highly conserved, and the Ets-related transcription factors bind to each other's recognition sequences with only slightly different affinities. Thus, overexpression of the DNA-binding domain of any Ets-related protein will function as a dominant negative inhibitor of all related transcription factors. The overexpression of the DNA binding domain of c-Ets-2 has been adapted to this purpose(25Langer S.J. Bortner D.M. Roussel M.F. Sherr Jr., C. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5355-5362Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the effect of expression of the c-Ets-2 DNA-binding domain on insulin and cAMP stimulation of CAT expression from the prolactin, somatostatin, and thymidine kinase promoters. The insulin stimulation of each of these promoters is reduced by 60-75% in cells overexpressing the c-Ets-2 DNA-binding domain, while cAMP-mediated increases are not significantly different. To determine if Ets-related proteins could bind to putative insulin response elements of the prolactin, somatostatin, and thymidine kinase genes, the Ets-related proteins Sap-1 and Elk-1 were used in gel mobility shift experiments with Ets-binding site-containing oligonucleotides from the insulin-responsive promoter constructs used in these experiments. The insulin response element of the prolactin gene is the Ets-binding sequence-related CGGAAA at -97/-92. Fig. 8A shows that both Elk-1 (lane 2) and Sap-1 (lane 3) but not SRF (not an Ets-related protein) (lane 4), bind to the insulin response element of the prolactin promoter. Control lysates (lane 9) demonstrate no binding in the region of the shifted band seen with Sap-1 or Elk-1. An excess of non-radiolabeled prolactin -106/-87 inhibits the formation of this complex (data not shown). Nuclear extract (lane 1), run as a control, produced a characteristic pattern of specific binding(18Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Google Scholar). However, no bands equal in migration to the Sap-1 and Elk-1 retarded species were seen in nuclear extract even with longer exposures. Sap-1 appears to have higher affinity since it shifts more label to a more slowly migrating form. However, this might result from differential efficiencies of Sap-1 and Elk-1 production in the reticulocyte lysates. The shifts produced by Sap-1 and Elk-1 are indistinguishable from one another. SRF added with Elk-1 (lane 5) or Sap-1 (lane 6) slightly decreases the binding of the Ets-related member of the ternary complex. This may result from slight inhibition of binding by factors in the reticulocyte lysate. Addition of Sap-1 and Elk-1 together results in no enhancement of the shift produced by Sap-1 alone nor does it produce additional migrating forms. Sap-1 incubation with an oligonucleotide to the somatostatin promoter (Fig. 8B) produces a more slowly migrating protein-DNA complex similar to that formed with Prl-106/-87 (Fig. 8B, lane 2). An excess of non-radioactive somatostatin +7/+47 inhibits the formation of this complex (Fig. 8B, lane 8). Nuclear extract proteins also bind to the somatostatin promoter (Fig. 8B, lanes 1 and 7), but no specific interactions of comparable migration with the Sap-1-DNA complex were seen even on longer exposure (Fig. 8B, lane 1 versus lane 2). No specific binding of Sap-1 was seen using an oligonucleotide whose Ets-binding sites were mutated by a G→C conversion (compare lane 5, Sap-1, with lane 6, unprogrammed lysate) (Fig. 8B). Sap-1 binds to the thymidine kinase promoter only when it has been mutated to contain an Ets-binding site (Fig. 8C). The wild type thymidine kinase promoter (-22/-2) shows no retarded bands when labeled DNA is incubated with Sap-1 (Fig. 8C, lane 2) that are not also present with unprogrammed lysate (Fig. 8C, lane 3). The oligonucleotide TKb corresponds to the this sequence (-22/-2) that is found in the insulin-sensitive TK(ls-21/-12)CAT and MTVTKb-CAT. Incubation of Sap-1 with 32P-labeled TKb results in two retarded complexes (Fig. 8C, lane 5). These bands are not seen with unprogrammed lysate (Fig. 8C, lane 6), and they are inhibited by an excess of unlabeled TKb (Fig. 8C, lane 8). Again, no specific bands corresponding to the Sap-1 shifted DNA are seen using nuclear extract (Fig. 8C, lane 4). Multiple lines of evidence presented here and previously (8Jacob K. Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Google Scholar) indicate that the sequence CGGA is a consensus response element for insulin effects in GH and HeLa cells. First, deletion and linker-scanning mutants of the prolactin promoter identified the sequence CGGAAA as essential for the insulin effect on the prolactin promoter, and this sequence could confer insulin responsiveness to ΔMTV-CAT(8Jacob K. Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Google Scholar). Second, the expression of CAT from several CGGA containing linker-scanning and deletion mutants of the thymidine kinase promoter is increased by insulin. When this linker sequence is inactivated, as in the plasmid TK(-95/+56ΔBamHI)CAT, insulin responsiveness is lost. The CGGA-containing sequence from one of the linker-scanning mutants was shown to confer insulin sensitivity when inserted into ΔMTV-CAT. Finally, CAT expression from a somatostatin promoter construct is also increased by insulin. Deletions that inactivate the cAMP response element of this gene have no effect on insulin regulation. However, deletion of sequences in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene, containing three Ets-binding motifs, eliminates the increased expression mediated by insulin. Point mutation of these motifs reduces the effect of insulin 75%, and a 24-bp deletion that removes the first 2 of these motifs completely eliminates the effect of insulin. When the three motifs are added back to the insulin-insensitive plasmid SS(-71/-1)CAT, the effect of insulin is restored. These effects are seen both in GH cells and in HeLa cells. Thus, the presence of one or more CGGA sites in the proximal promoter region confers insulin responsiveness in these cell lines. The effect of insulin to increase gene expression can be mediated by one copy of the insulin response element. The constructs ΔMTV(Prl-106/-77)CAT and ΔMTV(TKb)CAT are stimulated 4- and 6-fold by insulin, and they have only one copy of this sequence. The 5′-deletion mutants of the thymidine kinase promoter are also insulin responsive with only one copy of this sequence. However, the prolactin promoter has two Ets-related binding sequences, and the response of the prolactin promoter is approximately twice that of the thymidine kinase promoter constructs. Thus, multiple Ets motifs may mediate an increased response. This is not true of all cell lines. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the prolactin-CAT constructs and an expression vector for Pit-1 show low levels of prolactin-CAT expression. However, this activity is not inducible either by insulin or cAMP. 2F. M. Stanley, unpublished observation. Thus, it appears that Chinese hamster ovary cells lack transcription factors that are both important for high basal expression of this construct and its regulated expression. The sequence CGGA is able to confer insulin sensitivity only in cells with a necessary complement of transcription factors. The involvement of Ets-related proteins in insulin-increased gene transcription is suggested by the experiment with the dominant negative Ets plasmid and by the gel shift experiments. Cotransfection of cells with a plasmid that expresses the DNA-binding domain of c-Ets-2 causes a 75% reduction in the insulin sensitivity of the prolactin, somatostatin, and thymidine kinase promoters. The Ets-related proteins Elk-1 and Sap-1 were shown to bind sequences from these promoters that are insulin sensitive but not sequences that are insulin insensitive. The location of this sequence may also be important for its ability to mediate responses to insulin. The three insulin-sensitive promoters that we have described have the insulin response element inserted close to the transcription start site, the farthest away being the putative insulin response element of the wild type thymidine kinase gene at -150. Since this sequence is not uncommon in the genome, it is likely that this sequence is only effective within the first few hundred base pairs of the transcription start site. These data allowed us to establish several criteria for screening insulin-responsive genes for potential response elements. First, the sequence GGA is key to the insulin response element. Second, preference was given to sequences containing CGGA as in the prolactin and thymidine kinase promoters, but (A/T)GGA sequences were also considered (especially as a dimer with CGGA). Third, the limits -250/+50 were established since the IRE in the somatostatin gene is in the region +1/+50, and the upstream limit was established in accord with other Ets-responsive promoters that contain Ets-binding sites in the -200/-300 region. Finally, inverse sequences were also considered since the insulin response is transferred to ΔMTV-CAT by both the normal and inverse prolactin and thymidine kinase insulin response elements. These criteria allowed us to identify potential insulin response elements in 22 genes previously reported to be insulin sensitive. The utility of this type of analysis is clear for promoters where extensive deletional analysis has defined a region that contains the insulin response sequence. For example, the insulin response element of gene 33 likely resides in the first 100 base pairs (26Cadilla C. Isham K. Lee K. Ch'ang L. Johnson A. Kenney F. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 223-229Google Scholar) of the promoter. Comparison of this region of the gene 33 sequence with the consensus insulin response element identifies the sequence -93 CCGGATTGGCTGCGCGGAGG -74 that contains a direct repeat of the insulin responsive sequence (underlined). The insulin response of the c-fos promoter was mapped to the serum response element(27Stumpo D. Stewart T. Gilman M. Blackshear P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1611-1614Google Scholar). This sequence contains the sequence -225 GCGGAAGGTCTAGGAGA -209 that binds Elk-1. Elk-1 is an Ets-related protein that was shown to be phosphorylated by insulin. These studies do not rule out other insulin response elements, and it seems likely that there are other insulin-responsive sequences. Although all of the insulin-responsive promoters examined have sequences that are similar to the insulin response element of the prolactin promoter, the region of homology between our consensus insulin response element and the area of the gene known to be insulin sensitive does not correspond in all cases. For example, the negative insulin response element in the glucagon gene is apparently located at -268/-238, and this region does not contain a CGGAA sequence(28Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Google Scholar). Similarly, AGGA sequences reside outside of the insulin-responsive region of the amylase gene -167/-137(29Johnson T. Rosenberg M. Meisler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 464-468Google Scholar). In summary, we have defined a consensus insulin response element, CGGA, that can act in several different promoter contexts and in different cell types. The activity of this response element is most likely dependent on the presence of the proper insulin response pathway and insulin-responsive transcription factors in the cells. We thank Dr. Bruce M.

https://openalex.org/W2008631509,"Metabolic reactivation (incubating spheroplasts with galactose and casamino acids) causes disruption of nucleosomes from the upstream regions of the yeast GAL1, GAL10, and GAL80 genes. The disruption is specific. It depends on the transcription activator Gal4; it only occurs in galactose-reactivated chromatin from galactose-grown cells; it only affects upstream region, gene-proximal nucleosomes. Due to this specificity and because some of the same regions have shown induction-dependent changes by in vivo analyses, we suggest that the nucleosome-disrupted structure produced by reactivation is the authentic chromatin structure for these regions under conditions of galactose-induced GAL1-10 and GAL80 expression. It is necessary to carry out a spheroplast reactivation treatment in order to observe this disrupted structure in nuclear chromatin because nucleosomes are redeposited onto these regions during the preliminary steps of nuclear isolation (cell harvest/spheroplast preparation) probably in response to the nonphysiological conditions associated with these steps. However, during the same isolation procedures in cells lacking Gal80 protein, there is no nucleosome deposition on these regions, and the in vivo disrupted structure remains present in the nuclear chromatin.

GAL structural gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level by carbon source(1Johnston M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Google Scholar). GAL1-10, -7, and -2 are induced to very high levels of expression in galactose, via the activator Gal4p, 1The abbreviations used are: Gal4pGal4 proteinbpbase pair(s)MNasemicrococcal nucleaseUASGupstream activation sequenceGal80pGal80 proteinHRhypersensitive regionDBMdiazobenzyloxymethyl. but are completely inactive in other carbon sources. The GAL4 gene and GAL80, the gene that encodes the GAL-specific negative regulator, are expressed in all carbon sources (1Johnston M. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 458-476Google Scholar) as might be expected of regulatory genes, but their expression levels do vary with carbon source. For example, GAL80 expression occurs at a low basal level in glycerol but is induced 5-10-fold higher, via Gal4p, in galactose(2Shimada H. Fukusawa T. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 39: 1-9Google Scholar). Gal4 protein base pair(s) micrococcal nuclease upstream activation sequence Gal80 protein hypersensitive region diazobenzyloxymethyl. This gene family provides excellent opportunities to study the relationship of chromosome structure to gene regulation. Such studies have shown, for example, that under conditions of induced expression (galactose) Gal4p strongly protects the major promoter element, the UASG, on GAL1-10(3Giniger E. Varnum S. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Google Scholar, 4Lohr D. Hopper J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8409-8423Google Scholar, 5Selleck S. Majors J. Mol. Cell.

Gal4p protection of the GAL1-10 UASG is also strong in glycerol(3Giniger E. Varnum S. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Google Scholar, 4Lohr D. Hopper J.E.

This reflects the distinctive poised-for-expression status of the structural genes in this carbon source(7Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Google Scholar). Gal4p protection of the single UASG on GAL80 is weaker in glycerol(6Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10628-10632Google Scholar), perhaps to minimize interference with the basal promoter that drives GAL80 expression in glycerol(7Lohr D. Venkov P. Zlatanova J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 777-787Google Scholar). The UASG elements on GAL1-10 and GAL80 lie within constitutively nonnucleosomal, chromatin hypersensitive regions(4Lohr D. Hopper J.E.

In the uninduced expression state (glycerol, glucose), positioned nucleosomes are located between these hypersensitive regions and the genes, in the chromosomal copy (6Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The GAL10 TATA, the GAL1 TATA/transcription start site, and the GAL80 TATA/transcription start site are contained in these nucleosomes. In vivo analysis detected structural changes in two of the GAL1-10 intergenic nucleosomal regions upon galactose-induction of expression(5Selleck S. Majors J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3260-3267Google Scholar). However, no such changes were detectable in nuclear chromatin isolated from induced cells(9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe experiments that allow us to detect intergenic nucleosome changes in nuclear chromatin, thus reconciling the in vivo and nuclear results. In addition, these experiments yield some unexpected insights on nucleosome disruption/deposition processes taking place on gene control regions. Strain 21R yeast cells were grown as described previously (9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar) in glucose/glycerol/ethanol (D); galactose/glycerol/ethanol (G); glycerol/ethanol (g). These media allow growth of any cells in any medium, even 4D cells (disrupted GAL4) in galactose, and thus allow the most controlled comparison of the various strains. Yeast spheroplasts were made as described in (12Lohr D. Duffus J. Campbell I. Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1988: 125-145Google Scholar). Metabolic reactivation of spheroplasts consists of adding a carbon source to 2%, usually galactose in these studies, and casamino acids (to 0.5%) to the spheroplasts during the last few minutes of the ∼25-min incubation with the cell wall lytic enzyme Oxalyticase(12Lohr D. Duffus J. Campbell I. Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1988: 125-145Google Scholar). For our strains, the typical time exposed to reactivation conditions is 10-12 min. If reactivation media are added too early in the incubation with Oxalyticase, spheroplasting efficiency is affected. If the total incubation with Oxalyticase is allowed to proceed too long, spheroplasts begin to lyse. 2J. Lopez and D. Lohr, unpublished observations. The choice of typical conditions (10 min of reactivation, 25 min of total incubation with Oxalyticase) for this set of strains is sufficient for producing striking effects on chromatin (see below) while avoiding significant spheroplast lysis. Nuclei were isolated by method I(12Lohr D. Duffus J. Campbell I. Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1988: 125-145Google Scholar), and DNase I and MNase digestions were performed on the nuclei as described therein. DNase I and MNase cleavage sites were located by an indirect end label approach(13Nedospasov S. Georgiev G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 532-539Google Scholar, 14Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Google Scholar). The GAL1-10 patterns in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 5 were obtained by mapping from the essentially coincident TaqI (see Fig. 1) or EcoRI (see Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:) sites, which lie within the coding sequence of GAL10, ∼170 bp downstream of the GAL10 transcription start site (cf. (9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar)). The patterns in Fig. 4 were obtained by mapping from the EcoRI site within the coding sequence of GAL1, which lies ∼1100 bp downstream from the GAL1 transcription start site (cf. (8Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Google Scholar)). The patterns in Fig. 6 were obtained by mapping from the EcoRI site within the coding sequence of GAL80, which lies ∼400 bp downstream of the GAL80 transcription start site (cf. (6Lohr D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10628-10632Google Scholar)). DNA from the nuclear digests was purified (cf. (9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar)). Samples with similar and suitable digestion extents were chosen by analysis of the bulk patterns on mini-gels, cut with the appropriate restriction enzyme, and electrophoresed on denaturing gels (DNase I nuclear footprints) or native gels (MNase profiles) as described previously (9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar). DNA was electrophoretically transferred to DBM paper using a homemade electroblot apparatus. For all hybridizations, small (50-115 bp) probes abutting the mapping restriction sites were used so that probe homology ends below the smallest DNA bands on any of the patterns shown in this work. The probe was radiolabeled by random priming (15Feinberg A. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar) so both strand patterns are detected in all profiles. The DBM paper was washed and exposed to Kodak XAR film as described previously(9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar).Figure 2:MNase digestion patterns from the GAL1-10 intergenic region.

DNA sizes were determined by comparison to the mobilities of φX174/HaeIII marker fragments run on the gel (some of which are shown to the right of track 4: b, 1078 bp; c, 872 bp; d, 603 bp; e, 310 bp; h, 234 bp).

Note that the intensity response in these blots is size dependent(19Lohr D. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5966-5972Google Scholar). This causes α-β region intensity to be generally diminished relative to the other interband regions so that longer exposures are required to visualize α-β interband intensities in the reactivated profiles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5:MNase digestion patterns in chromatin from 80D cells.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Google Scholar, 9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar, 10Cavalli G. Thoma F.

The DNase I nuclear cleavage site pattern (Fig. 1) shows generally strong cleavage within the hypersensitive region (←, track 3), except for the UASG elements, which are protected by Gal4p; the nucleosomal regions, upstream of GAL10 and between the HR border and the GAL1 TATA, are relatively protected (○, track 3). These chromatin features are not present in naked DNA digests (Fig. 1, tracks 1 and 8) and show little dependence on digestion extent (cf. Fig. 1, tracks 3 and 4). The MNase cleavage site pattern (Fig. 2A) is a high intensity ladder of bands at ∼170-bp intervals across the intergenic region (α, β, γ, δ, ɛ; tracks 2 and 4), with little or no cleavage between these bands. It has been shown that the lack of cleavage in the interband regions α-β, γ-δ, and δ-ɛ is due to nucleosome protection(8Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Google Scholar, 9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar). Regions α-β and γ-δ correspond to the ○ regions in Fig. 1. Region β-γ, which is the nonnucleosomal hypersensitive region, is simply not cut by MNase in limited digests, even as naked DNA(8Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Google Scholar, 9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar). As reported previously(9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar), the intergenic region nuclear chromatin profiles from induced cells, which actively express the GAL1-10 genes, are basically the same as profiles from cells in which GAL1-10 are inactive, whether the inactivity is due to growth in a noninducing carbon source (Fig. 1, compare tracks 2 and 3) or to the absence of the transcription activator Gal4p (Fig. 2A, compare tracks 4 and 2). The single difference around the GAL1 5′ end in MNase profiles will be discussed below. This basic similarity would suggest that the chromatin structure of the intergenic region is insensitive to gene activity(9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar). However, in vivo analysis (5Selleck S. Majors J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3260-3267Google Scholar) detected induction-dependent structural changes within two nucleosomal portions of the intergenic region (× to the right of Fig. 1, track 5, and Fig. 2A, track 3). Since nucleosome structure on upstream regions may be an aspect of gene control(16Grunstein M. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 395-401Google Scholar, 17Felsenfeld G. Nature. 1992; 355: 219-223Google Scholar), we wanted to determine why these nucleosomes do not seem to be sensitive to gene activity in our nuclear chromatin. This issue was particularly perplexing because intergenic nucleosome changes were observed in a previous nuclear chromatin analysis(8Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Google Scholar), which used a yeast strain of uncharacterized GAL genotype. The strains used in (9Lohr D. Torchia T. Hopper J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15589-15597Google Scholar) (and below) comprise an isogenic series with a well characterized GAL pedigree and are widely used in GAL analysis. Note that in vivo and nuclear chromatin approaches only differ for the nucleosomal regions; the two approaches give similar results concerning UASG protection and the absence of induction-dependent change in the nonnucleosomal hypersensitive region. Isolating yeast nuclei involves a number of cell washing, harvesting, and spheroplasting steps that require 1-2 h at 0-4°C in nonphysiological solutions (cf. (12Lohr D. Duffus J. Campbell I. Yeast: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1988: 125-145Google Scholar)). This corresponds to starvation conditions for yeast cells. It was shown some time ago that incubation of spheroplasts in nutrients (a carbon source plus casamino acids) just prior to their lysis enhances the transcription level in nuclei isolated from the treated spheroplasts(18Beltz, W., 1977, RNA Synthesis in Isolated Yeast Nuclei. Ph.D. thesis, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL.Google Scholar). This treatment restores the spheroplasted cells to a metabolically active state, allowing them to recover from the starvation during the preliminary steps. To test whether this spheroplast reactivation treatment, which is not ordinarily used, might affect GAL1-10 chromatin structure, we have carried out comparative experiments in which cells harvested from a single culture were divided just prior to the final step in making spheroplasts, treatment with lytic enzyme. One aliquot was reactivated (see “Materials and Methods”) during the lytic treatment; the other was not. Nuclei were isolated from both sets of spheroplasts and digested with nucleases in parallel. The two sets of chromatin digests only differ in the presence of nutrients for a few minutes during spheroplast formation, thus excluding chromatin differences due to variations in cell growth or in day to day nuclear isolation/nuclease digestion conditions. Including a spheroplast reactivation step in the isolation of nuclei from galactose-induced cells results in exposure of the ○ protected chromatin regions to DNase I cleavage (Fig. 1, tracks 6 and 7), and of the α-β, γ-δ, and δ-ɛ interband regions to MNase cleavage (Fig. 2A, track 3). The exposure of DNA that is nucleosome-protected in unreactivated chromatin indicates that reactivation causes a significant nucleosome structural alteration, either unfolding or nucleosome loss. Reactivation also causes a loss of the high intensity MNase ladder pattern, due to reduced cleavage at sites β, γ, and δ (Fig. 2B, tracks 2-4 and 7). All of the reactivation-induced changes depend on functional Gal4p (Fig. 2B, tracks 4 and 5) and can only be triggered when cells are grown and spheroplasts are reactivated in galactose. Even spheroplasts from glycerol-grown cells show no evidence of nucleosome alterations (Fig. 2B, track 6), even if reactivated with galactose for up to 25 min (not shown), a period of time that is longer than the time required for galactose to induce full GAL1-10 expression in cells growing in glycerol. Reactivating spheroplasts from induced cells with nongalactose carbon sources also fails to produce any GAL1-10 chromatin changes (not shown). Thus, when isolated from reactivated spheroplasts, nuclear chromatin demonstrates galactose- and GAL4-dependent change in the GAL1-10 intergenic nucleosome regions. We can exclude a number of artifactual explanations for the DNA exposure produced by reactivation. Endogenous nuclease activity is negligible in both types of nuclei (not shown) and thus cannot explain the results. Spheroplast preparation can cause a heat shock-like response, which can be prevented by azide treatment of cells prior to harvest3; reactivation effects are the same with or without this treatment (not shown). Treatment with cycloheximide just prior to harvest does not alter the reactivation effect (not shown), so protein synthesis is apparently not required. Most importantly, histone profiles of nuclei from reactivated or unreactivated spheroplasts are very similar (Fig. 3, tracks 1 and 2). Thus, the reactivation-induced DNA exposure does not reflect a proteolysis artifact. The response of the three intergenic nucleosome regions to reactivation appears to vary in extent. However, we suggest that reactivation causes a similar and significant change on all three regions because reactivation causes each of the three to become similar to its corresponding naked DNA profile in both relative intensity level and cleavage pattern. For example, in reactivated chromatin profiles interband region γ-δ has the highest intensity, as it does in naked DNA profiles, and as in the naked profiles, this high intensity is limited to the GAL1-proximal half of the region (Fig. 2A, tracks 1 and 3). On the other hand, δ-ɛ region intensity is lower but spread through the whole region. In the α-β region, both DNase I (Fig. 1, tracks 6 and 7 versus 8), and MNase (not shown) reactivated chromatin cleavage patterns resemble naked patterns. Note particularly the region around the GAL10 TATA (Fig. 1). The similarities of reactivated and naked DNA profiles and the fact that changes are always observed in each of the three regions suggest that the same change occurs on all three nucleosomes and that the change involves major or complete nucleosome loss, but the possibility that any or all of these nucleosome changes are only partial or reflect only nucleosome unfolding cannot be excluded. We will refer to these changes as nucleosome disruption. The γ-δ nucleosome was suggested by in vivo approaches to be disrupted(20Axelrod J. Reagan M. Majors J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 857-869Google Scholar). Reactivation produces a strong MNase band at the GAL1 5′ end. This band has similar mobility to a band in the naked DNA profile and is a doublet like the naked band (Fig. 2B, tracks 1, 3, and 7). It probably reflects exposure of the DNA at the GAL1 5′ end due to the reactivation-induced loss of the δ-ɛ nucleosome that covered this site. The GAL1 5′ end region is extensively protected in unreactivated profiles from induced cells, over an even larger region than the nucleosome protection seen in the inactive state (Fig. 2A, tracks 2 and 4). This extensive protection is the one feature that differs between MNase digests of inactive and induced (unreactivated) chromatin. It may reflect the presence of stalled transcription-associated complexes near the GAL1 5′ end due to the nonphysiological conditions during harvest/spheroplast pretreatment (below). Reactivation produces no detectable change in the UASG footprint or within the hypersensitive region (Fig. 1, tracks 6 and 7) and, except for the extreme 5′ end, has no effect on the GAL1 intragenic chromatin pattern. As shown previously(8Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8474Google Scholar, 10Cavalli G. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4603-4613Google Scholar), galactose-induction of expression abolishes the very regular intragenic nucleosome pattern of inactive GAL1 (Fig. 4, track 4), resulting in more heterogeneous nuclease cutting and new bands ( , Fig. 4, track 5). However, reactivated and unreactivated patterns from galactose-induced cells are quite similar (Fig. 4, tracks 5 and 6). In these same profiles, the striking reactivation-dependent changes on the GAL1-10 intergenic region can be seen clearly (Fig. 4, tracks 2 and 3). Thus, reactivation only affects the intergenic nucleosomes. Nuclear chromatin isolated from galactose-induced cells that lack functional Gal80p (80D cells) shows the same features that are produced in wild-type chromatin by reactivation: nuclease accessibility of the DNA within the ○ protected regions (Fig. 1, track 5) and the α-β, γ-δ, δ-ɛ interband regions (Fig. 5, track 5) and weak cleavage at sites β, γ, and δ. However, these features are present in unreactivated chromatin from cells that lack Gal80p. Moreover, reactivation of these spheroplasts does not produce any further chromatin change (Fig. 5, track 4). Thus, the nucleosome-disrupted structure produced by reactivation in wild-type is present without reactivation in nuclear chromatin isolated from cells lacking Gal80p. The chromatin regions affected by reactivation in wild-type spheroplasts include most of the sites affected in vivo by the induction of GAL1-10 expression (×, Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Because of this similarity and the association of the reactivation changes with conditions specific to induced GAL1-10 expression (Gal4p, galactose), we suggest that the nucleosome-disrupted structure produced by reactivation is the authentic and in vivo active chromatin structure for the GAL1-10 intergenic region. Why then are nucleosomes found on this region in unreactivated nuclear chromatin from wild-type induced cells? The most likely explanation is that these nucleosomes were deposited on the region during the 1-2 h of cell harvest/spheroplast pretreatment, probably in response to the nonphysiological (0°C/starvation) conditions associated with these steps. Reactivation then causes disruption of these deposited nucleosomes, restoring the in vivo structure. On the other hand, the nucleosome-disrupted structure is maintained through these same steps when cells lack Gal80p"

Chem. 1991; 266: 22035-22043Google Scholar), the human growth hormone receptor(13de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Google Scholar), and the α- (14Herren B. Rooney B. Weyer K.A. Iberg N. Schmid G. Pech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15088-15095Google Scholar) and β-PDGFR(15Duan D.R. Pazin M.J. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 413-418Google Scholar). For the PDGFR, both groups expressed all five immunoglobulin-like domains in Chinese hamster ovary cells (15Duan D.R. Pazin M.J. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 413-418Google Scholar) and in baculovirus-infected insect cells(14Herren B. Rooney B. Weyer K.A. Iberg N. Schmid G. Pech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15088-15095Google Scholar). These glycosylated receptor extracellular domains were shown to exist as dimers but when deglycosylated appeared as monomers (15Duan D.R. Pazin M.J. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 413-418Google Scholar). These soluble receptors dimerized in the presence of added PDGF (14Herren B. Rooney B. Weyer K.A. Iberg N. Schmid G. Pech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15088-15095Google Scholar, 15Duan D.R. Pazin M.J. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 413-418Google Scholar), confirming the conclusion that receptor dimerization is essential for tyrosine kinase activation. The expression of reciprocal chimeric α/β-PDGFRs in an interleukin-3-dependent cell line (32D), showed that Ig-like domains 2-3 of the α-PDGFR must contain the major high affinity determinants for PDGF-AA binding(16Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Jensen R.A. Matsui T. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18741-18744Google Scholar, 17Heidaran M.A. Yu J.-C. Jensen R.A. Pierce J.H. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2884-2887Google Scholar, 18Yu J.-C. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10668-10674Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion within the second Ig-like loop of the α-PDGFR resulted in a marked decrease in binding PDGF-AA but not PDGF-BB(17Heidaran M.A. Yu J.-C. Jensen R.A. Pierce J.H. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2884-2887Google Scholar). To further evaluate the structural roles of Ig-like domains 2 and 3 in PDGF binding, we expressed and purified combinations of the α-PDGFR ECDs (2-3, 1-3, and 1-5) in quantities suitable for structure-function studies. Construction of Expression Vectors-The DNA representing the human α-PDGFR extracellular domains 2-3 (ECD 2-3101-341), 1-3 (ECD 1-324-341), and 1-5 (ECD 1-524-524) (6Matsui T. Heidaran M.A. Miki T. Popescu N. LaRochelle W. Kraus M. Pierce J. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1989; 243: 800-804Google Scholar) were synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction method with a BamHI and HindIII site at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the pQE9 plasmid (type 4) possessing an NH2-terminal six-histidine tag (Qiagen). DNA sequencing confirmed the authenticity of the cloned inserts. The recombinant vectors were transfected into competent M15 Escherichia coli cells carrying the plasmid pREP4. Protein expression and nickel-affinity purification was performed as described previously(19Mahadevan D. Thanki N. McPhie P. Beeler J. Yu J.-C. Wlodawer A. Heidaran M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 746-754Google Scholar). The three domain types (2-3, 1-3, and 1-5) were refolded by dialyzing into 2 M urea buffer (100 mM phosphate), pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Subsequently, the proteins were dialyzed into refolding buffer consisting of 100 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM reduced glutathione, 1 mM oxidized glutathione, 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.4. The refolded proteins were then dialyzed into 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, to remove the reduced and oxidized glutathione. The refolded domains were further purified by FPLC (Mono Q) (Pharmacia) and analyzed by 4-20% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Direct immobilization of the α-PDGFR extracellular domains (ECDs) 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5 were performed by overnight incubation in immunosorbent 96-well plates (Falcon 3912) at room temperature using 80 ng of purified protein in 50 μl of PBS in 0.02% sodium azide. Binding studies were performed with the monoclonal antibody to ECD 2 of the α-PDGFR (mAb αR1), PDGF-AA and -BB. The bound PDGF-AA or -BB were detected by anti-PDGF antibodies to the COOH-terminal region(20LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K. Aaronson S.A. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal SH2 domain of GTPase-activating protein was also directly immobilized and used as controls. For competition experiments, suramin was added at increasing concentrations in the presence of PDGF-AA (10 nM) or -BB (10 nM). Immunodetection was followed as described previously(21Heidaran M.A. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 140-145Google Scholar). ECD 1-3 or ECD 2-3 was labeled by the chloramine-T method (specific activity 8 × 104 cpm/ng). PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB (40 nM) were immobilized by overnight incubation in immunosorbent 96-well plates (Falcon 3912) at room temperature in 50 μl of PBS in 0.02% sodium azide. Immobilized PDGF ligands were washed by ice-cold HEPES binding buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) once and incubated in the presence of 5 ng/ml labeled ECD preincubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ECD, PDGF-AA, or PDGF-BB for 2 h at 16°C. Free 125I-ECD was removed by washing wells three times with ice-cold HEPES binding buffer and bound 125I-ECD was quantitated and analyzed by the method of Scatchard. The α-PDGFR ECD 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5, for circular dichroism spectroscopy were prepared in PBS at a protein concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. The protein concentrations of the stock solutions, used in CD measurements, were determined spectrophotometrically (23Prasad K. Lippoldt R.E. Edelbach H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5214-5219Google Scholar) and the spectra scaled according to standard CD spectra for immunoglobulins. The spectra were recorded using a 1-mm demountable “strain free” quartz cuvette on a JASCO J-500C spectropolarimeter in the wavelength range of 260-195 nm at room temperature. The following settings were used: bandwidth, 1 nm; time constant, 2.0 s; step resolution, 0.1 nm; scan speed, 10 millidegree/min; sensitivity, 1 millidegree/cm. Each spectrum represents an average of 4 scans with the baseline subtracted. To each of the domain types, recombinant human PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, and EGF (UBI) at a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml was added and the spectra were recorded as described above. The spectra for the growth factors alone were also measured as described above. In order to measure conformational changes assuming 1:1 stoichiometry, the combined spectrum of the ligand and receptor, added together, digitally, was compared to the spectrum of the complex as described by Timm et al.(24Timm D.E. Neet K.E. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 236-244Google Scholar). In order to characterize the molecular interactions between the α-PDGFR extracellular domains 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5 and PDGF-AA or -BB, the above domain combinations were cloned and expressed in bacteria (Fig. 1A). Each ECD combination was purified to about 90% by Ni2+ chelate affinity chromatography and analyzed by 4-20% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 1B, the apparent molecular masses for domains 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5 are 32, 46, and 70 kDa, respectively, predicting that they exist as soluble monomers under reducing and denaturing conditions. However, under nonreducing but denaturing conditions, domains 2-3 exist as a monomer while domains 1-3 and 1-5 exist as oligomers (data not shown). This suggests that domain 1 possesses the determinants that may mediate the receptor oligomerization of ECD 1-3 and ECD 1-5 by interdisulfide bonds. A neutralizing mAb αR1 directed against the α-PDGFR, bound the native receptor with high affinity(25LaRochelle W.J. Jensen R.A. Heidaran M.A. May-Siroff M. Wang L.-M. Aaronson S.A. Pierce J.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 547-553Google Scholar). The epitope recognized by the mAb αR1 was shown to be denatured under reducing conditions(18Yu J.-C. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10668-10674Google Scholar). Furthermore, the major αPDGFR epitope binding to mAb αR1 was localized to Ig-like domain 2 (18Yu J.-C. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10668-10674Google Scholar). These findings indicated that high affinity binding of mAb αR1 to αPDGFR requires proper folding of determinants within Ig-like domain 2. Therefore, bacterially expressed domains 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5 were analyzed for proper folding by solid phase binding assays with the monoclonal antibody of the α-PDGFR (mAb αR1). Results shown in Fig. 2 indicated binding to the ECD 1-5, ECD 1-3 with a half-maximal value of around 0.4 nM while ECD 2-3 showed half-maximal binding at concentration of about 0.6 nM. This confirmed that all three receptor ECD types were correctly refolded, however, the maximal binding of ECDs 1-3 and 1-5 was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher than that of ECD 2-3. Therefore, our results suggest that ECD 1 may be indirectly involved in binding of mAb αR1. Far-UV CD spectroscopy was performed to investigate the folding of the three ECD types, to determine whether they possessed Ig-like structures and to study ligand-induced conformational changes. The CD spectra of the purified ECD 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5 indicated domains composed essentially of β-sheet (trough at 215 nm) similar to that observed for Ig-like domains and also confirmed that they were correctly folded. The calculated secondary structure for the 3 ECD types are 45-56% β-sheet and 44-56% turns (Table 1)(28Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar). Fig. 3, A-C, show the far-UV CD spectra of the the ECDs and their recorded spectra of a 1:1 mixture with the indicated PDGF ligands. Moreover, a calculated spectra for a 1:1 mixture of ECD and PDGF ligand is indicated. Fig. 3D, shows the spectrum of PDGF-AA or -BB which has a calculated β-sheet content of 60%. The addition of PDGF-AA at an equimolar ratio to the three ECD types showed a significant conformational change for domains 2-3 (increased mean residue ellipticity) in which the β-sheet content increased from 56 to 100% but not for domains 1-3 and 1-5 (Table 1). However, the addition of EGF to these ECD types did not show conformational changes, eliminating the possibility of nonspecific binding and conformational changes (data not shown).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Interestingly, the addition of PDGF-BB to ECD 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5 markedly changed their conformation in the following order: 1-5 = 1-3 > 2-3 (decreased mean residue ellipticity) (Fig. 4, A-C). These conformational changes are in the opposite direction to that observed when PDGF-AA was added to ECD 2-3 (Fig. 3, A-C). The wild type receptor as well as the eukaryotic expression of all five Ig-like domains have shown high affinity binding to both PDGF-AA and -BB(14Herren B. Rooney B. Weyer K.A. Iberg N. Schmid G. Pech M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15088-15095Google Scholar, 15Duan D.R. Pazin M.J. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 413-418Google Scholar, 26Jensen R.A. Beeler J.F. Heidaran M.A. Aaronson S.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10887-10892Google Scholar, 27Heldin C.-H. Ernlund A. Rorsman C. Ronnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8905-8912Google Scholar). To investigate binding of PDGF-AA and -BB to each ECD type, we developed a solid phase binding assay in which the ECDs were immobilized. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the immobilized ECD 1-3 and ECD 1-5 each bound PDGF -AA at a concentration of 2-20 nM. However, the binding capacity of ECD 2-3 was 50% less as compared to ECD 1-3 and ECD 1-5. This is very similar to the differential observed for mAb αR1 binding to these ECDs. PDGF-BB bound to all three ECD types at concentrations between 2.0 and 3.0 nM (Fig. 5B), indicating that ECD 2-3 possess the major determinants for PDGF-BB binding. We next quantitated the affinity of ECD 1-3 and ECD 2-3 for each PDGF ligand. Accordingly, the level of 125I-ECD 1-3 or 125I-ECD 2-3 binding to the immobilized PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled homologous ECDs. The results were then analyzed by the method of Scatchard using a one ligand/one class of binding site model. As shown in Fig. 6A, Scatchard analysis of 125I-ECD 1-3 binding to PDGF-BB measured high affinity binding sites with a KD of 74 nM. A similar analysis of 125I-ECD 2-3 binding to PDGF-BB measured a similar number of binding sites with a KD value of 72 nM (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6C, Scatchard analyses of 125I-ECD 1-3 binding to PDGF-AA estimated high affinity binding sites with a KD value of 33 nM. In striking contrast, 125I-ECD 2-3 reproducibly showed a similar number of binding sites with a KD value of 87 nM (Fig. 6D). Thus deletion of ECD 1 impaired the affinity of ECD 2-3 for PDGF-AA binding by more than 2-fold, without having a comparable effect on PDGF-BB binding. Under these conditions, the binding of 125I-ECD 1-3 or 2-3 was also competed by increasing concentrations of unlabeled PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB with similar kinetics as shown with unlabeled ECDs (data not shown). These results are consistent with the finding that the soluble β-PDGFR receptors have KD values of 30-100 nM, but when immobilized provided a value of 0.4 nM(27Heldin C.-H. Ernlund A. Rorsman C. Ronnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8905-8912Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-PDGFR ECD 1-3 was expressed in NIH 3T3 cells as a Fc fusion protein bound to PDGF-BB with an affinity of 1.5 nM. The α-PDGFR ECD 1-3 competed with the β-PDGFR ECD 1-3 for PDGF-BB binding with a half-maximal value of 10 nM(21Heidaran M.A. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 140-145Google Scholar), thus confirming that the recombinant α-PDGFR ECD types shown here compare well with those expressed in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the extent of complex formation between PDGF and ECDs is at least 78% in an equimolar mixture since the KD value of ECD for PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB is not greater than 80 nM. Thus, our data indicates that most ECDs exist in complexes with PDGF under the experimental conditions used for CD spectroscopy.Figure 6:Scatchard analysis of 125I-ECD binding to PDGF. PDGF-BB (A and B) or PDGF-AA (C and D) was immobilized on immunosorbent 96-well plates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immobilized PDGF ligand was incubated in the presence of 5 ng/ml of indicated 125I-ECD preincubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of appropriate unlabeled ECDs. Data was then subjected to Scatchard analysis(32Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further demonstrate the specificity of the binding interaction, we utilized suramin as a potent PDGF antagonist. Competition studies demonstrated that suramin inhibited PDGF-AA or -BB binding to the ECD types with half-maximal values in the range 1.25-2.5 μM (Fig. 7, A and B). This assay provides means to test potential agonists or antagonists as described previously(21Heidaran M.A. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 140-145Google Scholar, 22Middaugh C.R. Mach H. Burke C.J. Volkin D.B. Dabora J.M. Tsai P.K. Bruner M.W. Ryan J.A. Marfia K.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9016-9024Google Scholar). In this report we describe bacterial expression, purification, and refolding of the α-PDGFR ECDs 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5 to evaluate structural features that contribute to PDGF binding. The nativeness of ECDs was confirmed by 1) CD spectroscopy and 2) a monoclonal antibody (mAb αR1) which recognizes a nonlinear epitope within ECD 2. In vitro binding studies using an immunoadsorbant assay indicated that immobilized ECD types 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5 each bound to PDGF-BB at very similar concentrations (2-3 nM). However, ECD 2-3, 1-3, and 1-5 bound PDGF-AA at concentrations of 20, 11, and 7.5 nM, respectively. Scatchard analyses of binding studies using labeled ECD 1-3 and ECD 2-3 cross-competed with unlabeled ECD types or PDGF ligands, indicated that deletion of ECD 1 from ECD 1-3 impaired PDGF-AA binding by more than 2-fold without affecting PDGF-BB binding. Therefore, our results suggest that αPDGFR extracellular domain 1 is differentially required for high affinity interaction with PDGF-AA but not PDGF-BB. Previously, it was shown that an α/β chimeric PDGFR, in which domain 1 of the α-PDGFR was substituted for domain 1 of the β-PDGFR, bound to PDGF-AA with high affinity. Another α/β chimeric PDGFR in which ECD 1-3 of the β-PDGFR was substituted for the ECD 1-3 of the α-PDGFR also bound to PDGF-AA with high affinity (16Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Jensen R.A. Matsui T. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18741-18744Google Scholar). In addition, a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants encoding the first two Ig-like domains (αR1-216) and an internal deletion mutants lacking Ig-like loop 3 (αR235-290) could not bind to PDGF-AA(18Yu J.-C. Mahadevan D. LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10668-10674Google Scholar). Moreover, an internal deletion mutant lacking Ig-like loop 2 (αR150-189) did not affect PDGF-BB binding but affected PDGF-AA binding(17Heidaran M.A. Yu J.-C. Jensen R.A. Pierce J.H. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2884-2887Google Scholar). Taken together these results suggest that ECD 1 of the α-PDGFR is not directly involved in PDGF-AA binding. Instead ECD 1 is likely to be required for correctly orienting the other domains with respect to each other, so that the high affinity binding determinants are positioned close to each other. In contrast, for PDGF-BB, it appears that the determinants on ECD 2-3 are in the correct orientation, as indicated by high affinity binding to PDGF-BB. We have also examined the physical characteristics of the α-PDGFR ECD types in the absence and presence of PDGF. Our data indicate that PDGF induces distinct conformational changes in the three ECD types. PDGF-AA significantly changed the conformation of ECD 2-3 by increasing the mean residue ellipticity but did not change the conformation of ECDs 1-3 or 1-5. It is postulated that the orientation of ECD 2-3, with respect to each other by domain 1, may be essential for correct exposure of the binding determinants. This observation is reflected in the direct binding assay where the efficiency of ECD 2-3 for PDGF-AA binding is enhanced in the presence of ECD 1. In contrast, PDGF-BB binding changed the conformation all three domain types with the following rank order: 1-5 = 1-3 > 2-3 by decreasing the mean residue ellipticity. Since direct binding of the three ECD types to PDGF-BB are very similar, the conformational change observed here is likely to be due to an induced fit mechanism. The crystal structure and mutagenesis studies performed on PDGF-BB has allowed the identification of three surface loops, two at one end of the molecule (loops 1 and 3) and the third (loop 2) at the opposite end of the elongated twisted β-sheet monomer. The dyad axis relating the two monomers brings loops 1 and 3 of one monomer close to loop 2 of the symmetry related monomer(29Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Winkler F. Eggimann B. Hosang M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3921-3926Google Scholar, 30LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. May-Siroff M. Giese N. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17074-17077Google Scholar, 31Ostman A. Andersson M. Hellman U. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10073-10077Google Scholar). Since, PDGF-BB and -AA have a high degree of sequence similarity they are predicted to possess similar three-dimensional structures. The sequences within the same three loops in PDGF-AA, when compared with those identified for PDGF-BB, have changed from basic to hydroxy amino acids. These major sequence differences between PDGF-AA and -BB loop regions may contribute to the different affinities and mode of interaction with the α-PDGFR observed in this study. Taken together, all of our findings are consistent with the proposed model depicted in Fig. 8, A and B, demonstrating the molecular interaction of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB with the ECD 1-3 and ECD 2-3. According to this model, during the refolding process, the determinants within ECD 1 induce conformational changes within ECD 2 required for a tight interaction with PDGF-AA but not with PDGF-BB. As shown in Fig. 8A the requirement of ECD 1-induced changes in ECD 2 and 3 for PDGF-AA binding is further necessitated by the distinct physiochemical properties of binding determinants within PDGF-AA in comparison to PDGF-BB (see discussion above). Fig. 8B also illustrates how the loss of determinants within ECD 1 leads to lack of conformational change within ECD 2 and 3 necessary for tight PDGF-AA bindings. The physical consequence of this effect is PDGF-AA-induced conformational changes in ECD 2 and 3 (measured by CD and reflected by the reduced affinity) to allow such binding. In contrast the binding of PDGF-BB to ECD 2-3 is not affected since the binding site for this ligand is in the correct orientation. In conclusion, we show that for PDGF-AA binding, ECD 2 and 3 are necessary and that ECD 1 orients these domains with respect to each other so that binding determinants are correctly positioned in three-dimensional space. However, for PDGF-BB, ECD 2-3 are correctly oriented for high affinity binding. The availability of large amounts of purified α-PDGFR ECDs will allow us to define the molecular interactions with PDGF in detail using x-ray crystallography. Furthermore, since PDGF and its receptor are implicated in a number of disease states including cancer, the immunosorbent assay system developed will help screen and identify potential agonists and antagonists of the α-PDGFR that could be of therapeutic value.

The HD is highly conserved with respect to structure and function throughout evolution and is a common component of numerous proteins that regulate transcription during development (for reviews, see (4Scott M.P.

Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 158-172Google Scholar, 9Corsetti M.T. Briata P. Sanseverino L. Daga A. Airoldi I. Simeone A. Palmisano G. Angelini C. Boncinelli E. Corte G.

A. 1992; 89: 2086-2090Google Scholar). It is unlikely that HD-containing proteins exert their different selective functions in vivo only through protein-DNA interactions, since they share similar DNA-binding specificities in vitro(4Scott M.P. Tammkun J.W. Hartzell G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 25-48Google Scholar, 5Laughon A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11357-11367Google Scholar). Thus, it is presumed that although a single HD has the potential to bind to many DNA-target sites it may be specifically recruited into a functional complex at only a subset of those sites by selective protein-protein interactions(12Stern, S., Tanaka, M., Herr, W., Nature, 345, 783–785.Google Scholar, 13Pomerantz J.L.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 739-743Google Scholar). Furthermore, in some cases the HD has been demonstrated to be dispensable for activity in vivo(16Ananthan J. Baler R. Morrissey D. Zuo J. Lan Y. Weir M. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1599-1609Google Scholar, 17Fitzpatrick V.D. Percival-Smith A. Ingles C.J. Krause H.M. Nature. 1992; 356: 610-612Google Scholar).Recently, the human homeobox genes EVX1 and EVX2 have been isolated and sequenced(18Faiella A. D'Esposito M. Rambaldi M. Acampora D. Balsofiore S.

Boncinelli E. Genomics. 1991; 10: 43-50Google Scholar). These genes encode proteins containing a HD closely related to that encoded by the Drosophila even-skipped, which belongs to the pair-rule class of segmentation genes and is required for the proper development of the metameric body plan of the fruit fly(20Macdonald P.M. Ingham P. Struhl G. Cell. 1986; 47: 721-734Google Scholar, 21Frasch M. Hoey T. Rushlow C. Doyle H Levine M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 749-759Google Scholar, 22Jäckle H. Sauer F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 505-512Google Scholar). Also the murine Evx 1 and Evx 2 genes have been cloned, and Evx 1 expression pattern during mouse embryogenesis has been studied(23Bastian H. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1839-1852Google Scholar). During early embryogenesis, Evx 1 is expressed in a biphasic manner. From day 7 to 9 of development its expression emerges at the posterior end of the embryo within the primitive ectoderm and later in the mesoderm and neuroectoderm. From day 10 to 12.5, Evx 1 transcripts are restricted to specific cells within the neural tube and hindbrain, while no expression is detectable in a variety of adult tissues. Spyropoulos et al.(24Spyropoulos D.D Capecchi M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1949-1961Google Scholar) have recently shown that the targeted disruption of the Evx 1 gene in mice causes early postimplantation lethality of the conceptus.Several authors have reported that the even-skipped gene product acts as a transcriptional repressor both in in vitro assays (25Biggin M.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 58: 433-440Google Scholar, 26Johnson F.B. Krasnow M.A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2177-2189Google Scholar, 27TenHarmsel A. Austin R.J. Savenelli N. Biggin M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2742-2752Google Scholar) and in cell transfection experiments(28Han K. Levine M.S. Manley J. Cell. 1989; 56: 573-583Google Scholar, 29Han K. Manley J.L. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 491-503Google Scholar). On the contrary, Jones et al.(30Jones F.S. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2091-2095Google Scholar) showed that the mouse Evx 1 protein induces the expression of a reporter gene driven by the chicken Tenascin-C promoter. The same authors restricted the sequences that contributed to the activation to a segment containing a TRE known to bind transcription factors belonging to the AP-1 family. Currently, the role of the human EVX1 and EVX2 proteins in gene transcription is unknown.The aim of our study was to investigate the transcriptional activity of EVX1 in transfected mammalian cells. Our data indicate that EVX1 expression strongly reduces, in a concentration-dependent manner, the basal and activated transcription of the reporter gene CAT directed by a variety of cell-specific and viral promoters in several different mammalian cell lines. EVX1 transcriptional repressor function is evident using both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters. We also show that the repressor function of EVX1 is contained within a C-terminal region rich in alanine and proline residues and is independent of the presence of DNA-binding sites for EVX1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of EVX1 Recombinant ProteinEVX1 protein was produced in the baculovirus system according to the method previously described in detail (9Corsetti M.T. Briata P. Sanseverino L. Daga A. Airoldi I. Simeone A. Palmisano G. Angelini C. Boncinelli E. Corte G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4465-4472Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, pVL941/EVX1 was obtained by inserting the filled in Sau3AI-Sau3AI (1453 bp) EVX1 cDNA fragment (18Faiella A. D'Esposito M. Rambaldi M. Acampora D. Balsofiore S. Stornaiuolo A. Mallamaci A. Migliaccio E. Gulisano M. Simeone A. Boncinelli E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 23: 6541-6545Google Scholar) in the filled in BamHI cloning site of pVL941 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Recombinant baculovirus particles (Baculogold/EVX1) were obtained by transfecting Sf9 cells with the wild type Baculogold™ (Pharmingen) viral DNA together with pVL941/EVX1 and purified by limiting dilution and dot hybridization. For the production of EVX1 protein, 500 × 106 Sf9 cells were infected with five plaque-forming units/cell of the recombinant virus, and cells were recovered and lysed as described previously(9Corsetti M.T. Briata P. Sanseverino L. Daga A. Airoldi I. Simeone A. Palmisano G. Angelini C. Boncinelli E. Corte G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4465-4472Google Scholar). Both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with silver. A band that was absent in lysates from cells infected with a control virus was present in the profile of the nuclear lysates, accounting for approximately 2% of the total proteins (not shown). EVX1 protein was purified by ion exchange chromatography using Q and S Sepharose Fast Flow columns (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). After elution, the fractions containing the recombinant protein were renatured by extensive dialysis against buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol) at 4°C. The recombinant protein was stored in buffer D supplemented with 20% glycerol at -80°C.General handling techniques for baculovirus expression system were performed essentially as described in (31Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, 1987Google Scholar).Cells, Antibodies, and Western BlottingHeLa human cervix carcinoma cells, F9 teratocarcinoma cells, and InR1-G9 hamster glucagonoma cells (32Takaki R. Ono J. Nakamura M. Yokogawa Y. Kumae S. Hiroaka T. Yamaguchi K. Uchida S. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1986; 22: 120-126Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. β-TC1 mouse insulinoma cells (33Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod M. Spector D. Delamoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9037-9041Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 12.5% horse serum, 2.5% fetal calf serum, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin as above. NIH-3T3, mouse fibroblast cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin as detailed above.Mouse monoclonal antibodies to EVX1 were produced and characterized according to methods previously described(34Corte G. Moretta L. Damiani G. Mingari M.C. Bargellesi A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 162-170Google Scholar, 35Gefter M.L. Margulies D.H. Scharff M.D. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 231-237Google Scholar). Determination of Ig classes was carried out by standard procedures utilizing the Mouse Typer Sub-Isotyping kit (Bio-Rad).For immunoblot analysis, nuclear lysates of infected Sf9 cells were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to standard procedures. The filters were incubated with the supernatant of hybridoma cells, followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody from Sigma. Nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-1-phosphate were used as the substrates (Promega, Madison, WI) with a positive reaction resulting in purple color.Immunofluorescence and ImmunohistochemistryFor immunofluorescence, cytospins were prepared and fixed in acetone at -20°C for 5 min. Cells were incubated for 2-16 h at room temperature with supernatant of hybridoma cells, followed by extensive washes and by incubation with rhodaminated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature.Immunohistochemistry was performed according to the streptavidin-biotin complex technique using a commercially available kit system (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Nuclei were counterstained for 5 min with Mayer's hematoxylin solution (Sigma).Plasmidsp[-1.1]GLU-CAT and p[-0.35]GLU-CAT were previously described and characterized (36Drucker D.J. Philippe J. Jepeal L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15659-15665Google Scholar, 37Knepel W. Chafitz J. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6799-6804Google Scholar, 38Gherzi R. Fehmann H.-C. Volz A.

Göke (Marburg, Germany), pCAT™-Promoter was purchased from Promega, pRSV-CAT (39Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. M. Beato (Marburg, Germany), and p7B2-I-CAT was described previously (40Waldbieser G.C. Aimi J. Dixon J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3228-3236Google Scholar) and obtained from Dr. B. Göke (Marburg, Germany). pInr-CAT was constructed by cloning synthetic oligonucleotides containing the appropriate sequence (41Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Google Scholar) into the PstI and XbaI sites of pCAT™-Basic vector purchased from Promega. The pCMV-EVX1 expression construct was generated by cloning the Klenow-filled in Sau3AI-Sau3AI fragment containing the complete open reading frame of the EVX1 cDNA (18Faiella A. D'Esposito M. Rambaldi M. Acampora D. Balsofiore S. Stornaiuolo A. Mallamaci A. Migliaccio E. Gulisano M. Simeone A. Boncinelli E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 23: 6541-6545Google Scholar) into the Klenow-filled in HindIII site of the pRC-CMV expression vector purchased from Invitrogen Corp. (San Diego, CA). The pCMV-HOXD4 expression construct was generated by cloning the ApaI-ApaI fragment containing the complete open reading frame of the HOXD4 cDNA (42Mavilio F. Simeone A. Giampaolo A. Faiella A. Zappavigna V. Acampora D. Poiana G. Russo G. Peschle C. Boncinelli E. Nature. 1986; 324: 664-668Google Scholar) into the ApaI site of the pRC-CMV expression vector. pCMV-ΔEVX1 and pCMV-ɛEVX1 expression constructs were generated by cloning PCR-amplified fragments containing the 5′ 750 bp and the 3′ 675 bp of the open reading frame of EVX1 cDNA, respectively, in the pRC-CMV expression vector. The chimeric construct pCMV-HOXC6/EVX1 was created by ligating the 5′ 612-bp fragment of HOXC6 (indicated as pCMV-HOXC6N when cloned into pRC-CMV and utilized as the control for transfection experiments; (9Corsetti M.T. Briata P. Sanseverino L. Daga A. Airoldi I. Simeone A. Palmisano G. Angelini C. Boncinelli E. Corte G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4465-4472Google Scholar) and references cited therein) with the 3′ 459-bp fragment of EVX1 and cloning the construct into the pRC-CMV vector. For PCR reactions, ULTma™ DNA polymerase from Perkin-Elmer was used. Oligonucleotides were obtained from TIB MolBiol, Genova, Italy.General handling of plasmid DNA was performed according to previously described techniques(43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).DNA Transfections and CAT AssaysInR1-G9 and β-TC1 cells transient transfection was performed essentially as described by Fehmann and Habener (44Fehmann H.-C. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1982; 130: 159-166Google Scholar) with the modification reported in (38Gherzi R. Fehmann H.-C. Volz A. Ponassi M. Göke B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 460-468Google Scholar). HeLa and F9 cells were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate technique, performed exactly as reported in (45Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1990Google Scholar). Transient transfection of NIH-3T3 by the electroporation technique was performed using a Gene Pulser™ apparatus (Bio-Rad) as follows: 4 × 106 NIH-3T3 cells in complete medium were electroporated by applying a voltage of 0.25 kV and a capacitance of 960 microfarads. In each transfection experiment the cell number of each well was controlled by both protein concentration assays and cell counting, and variation never exceeded 10%. pRSV-CAT was used in each transfection as an internal control of transfection efficiency. Cell treatment with signal-transducing agents started 30 h after transfection and was carried out for 16 h in medium without serum. Thereafter, cells were harvested, extracts were prepared, and CAT activity was measured as detailed by Sambrook et al.(43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), according to the modifications described in (46Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J-P. Guerin S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated a minimum of three times.RNase Protection and RT-PCR AnalysisTotal RNA was prepared from InR1-G9 cells transfected with p[-1.1]GLU-CAT and either pRC-CMV or pCMV-EVX1 by the guanidine/cesium chloride method(45Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1990Google Scholar). RNase protection analysis was performed using the RPA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. As a probe, an antisense strand RNA provided by Ambion (CAT-Direct) was used. RT-PCR was performed exactly as reported in (47Gherzi R. Ponassi M. Gaggero B. Zardi L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 335-339Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression of the EVX1 Protein and Production of Monoclonal AntibodiesEVX1 was expressed in the baculovirus system and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1A), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the recombinant protein showed an apparent molecular mass higher (62 kDa) than predicted by its amino acid sequence (42.5 kDa). Mouse monoclonal antibodies were prepared against EVX1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The antibody used in this study (mAb B6-41) is an IgG1 that strongly reacts in Western blot with EVX1 in total nuclear lysates of Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant virus Baculogold/EVX1. No immunoreactivity to HOXB7, HOXC6, HOXD4, and HOXA10 in the nuclear lysates of Sf9 cells infected with the corresponding recombinant viruses was detected (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Furthermore, nuclei of Sf9 cells infected with the Baculogold/EVX1 recombinant virus showed a bright staining in immunofluorescence when reacted with mAb B6-41, while nuclei of Sf9 cells either noninfected or infected with Baculogold/HOXB7, HOXC6, HOXD4, or HOXA10, were negative (data not shown).In order to determine whether mAb B6-41 is able to recognize the fully processed EVX1 expressed in human cells, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the expression construct pCMV-EVX1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays nuclei of approximately 20% of HeLa cells showed a strong staining when reacted with mAb B6-41, while cells transiently transfected with pRC-CMV were negative (Fig. 1, B and C).EVX1 Represses Basal and Activated Transcription from Several PromotersTo investigate the transcriptional properties of the human EVX1 in vivo we transiently cotransfected glucagonoma cells InR1-G9 with an EVX1 expression vector (pCMV-EVX1) together with two plasmids (p[-1.1]GLU-CAT and p[-0.35]GLU-CAT) in which the transcription of the reporter CAT is directed by regions of the rat proglucagon gene promoter(36Drucker D.J. Philippe J. Jepeal L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15659-15665Google Scholar, 37Knepel W. Chafitz J. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6799-6804Google Scholar, 38Gherzi R. Fehmann H.-C. Volz A. Ponassi M. Göke B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 460-468Google Scholar). p[-1.1]GLU-CAT contains 1.1 kilobases of the promoter sequence(38Gherzi R. Fehmann H.-C. Volz A. Ponassi M. Göke B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 460-468Google Scholar), which includes, between positions -503 and -487, 2EMBL accession number to the sequence: Z35161. the element ANATTANNNNNTAATNG (which is very similar to the consensus TNATTANNNNNTAATNG found to be bound with high affinity by the human recombinant EVX1). 3Antonio Daga and G. Corte, submitted for publication. On the contrary, p[-0.35]GLU-CAT does not contain this consensus sequence. Homeobox proteins have been reported to play important roles in cell-specific gene transcription in pancreatic islet cells(48Karlsson O. Thor S. Norberg T. Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Nature. 1990; 344: 879-882Google Scholar, 49Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Google Scholar, 50Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T. Ferreri K. Lee S. Montminy M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1275-1283Google Scholar). Thus, it was not surprising to find a putative EVX1 DNA-binding site in the proglucagon gene promoter. As previously reported, p[-1.1]GLU-CAT and p[-0.35]GLU-CAT direct high levels of CAT transcription in InR1-G9 cells, p[-0.35]GLU-CAT being less effective than p[-1.1]GLU-CAT(38Gherzi R. Fehmann H.-C. Volz A. Ponassi M. Göke B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 460-468Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A and inFig. 4, the basal transcriptional activity of either p[-1.1]GLU-CAT or p[-0.35]GLU-CAT was approximately 90% reduced when each of the reporter plasmids was cotransfected with the expression plasmid pCMV-EVX1 in InR1-G9 cells in comparison with either the pRC-CMV alone or the expression plasmid containing the HOXD4 cDNA (pCMV-HOXD4; see “Experimental Procedures”). These observations, together with results presented below (seeFig. 6), suggest that EVX1 represses transcription directed by a promoter either containing or not containing its high affinity DNA target sites.Figure 2:EVX1 represses basal and activated transcriptional activity of the rat proglucagon gene promoter in transiently transfected InR1-G9 cells. A, cells were transiently transfected in suspension using the DEAE-dextran technique (see “Experimental Procedures”) with 10 μg of the reporter plasmid p[-1.1]GLU-CAT and 10 μg of the effector plasmids indicated. 30 h later cells were changed to serum-free medium with or without 20 μM forskolin. After a further 16 h, cells were harvested, and the CAT activity present in aliquots of cell extracts was measured, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the average (± S.E.) of five independent experiments (performed in duplicate). In the lower part of the panel, a representative autoradiogram of one experiment (performed in duplicate) is shown. B, cells were transfected with 10 μg of the reporter plasmid p[-1.1]GLU-CAT and 10 μg of the effector plasmids indicated. 30 h later cells were changed to serum-free medium with or without 160 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

In the lower part of the figure, a representative autoradiogram of one experiment (performed in duplicate) for each cell line is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next we investigated whether transcriptional repression is exerted by EVX1 at any concentration of the transfected expression vector. As shown in Fig. 3, repression by EVX1 is a concentration-dependent phenomenon in a range of transfected pCMV-EVX1 vector from 0.1 to 8 μg.Figure 3:EVX1 functions as a transcriptional repressor in a concentration-dependent manner. Subconfluent InR1-G9 cells were transfected in suspension using the DEAE-dextran technique with 10 μg of the reporter plasmid p[-1.1]GLU-CAT and different amounts (as indicated) of pCMV-EVX1. 46 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and aliquots of lysates were assayed for CAT activity as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are the average (± S.E.) of three independent experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It has been reported that the mouse Evx 1 activates the chicken Tenascin-C promoter in transfected cells by interacting with a TRE(30Jones F.S. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2091-2095Google Scholar). The rat proglucagon gene promoter contains binding sites for transcription factors belonging to the AP1 and CREB families and is regulated by protein kinase A and protein kinase C activators in pancreatic cell lines(36Drucker D.J. Philippe J. Jepeal L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15659-15665Google Scholar, 37Knepel W. Chafitz J. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6799-6804Google Scholar, 38Gherzi R. Fehmann H.-C. Volz A. Ponassi M. Göke B. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 460-468Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation of p[-1.1]GLU-CAT by forskolin (Fig. 2A) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Fig. 2B) was approximately 9O% reduced by cotransfection of pCMV-EVX1 in comparison with pRC-CMV alone. Similar results were obtained using β-TC1 insulinoma cells (not shown).To investigate whether the transcriptional repression is restricted to the specific promoter we used in the above described experiments, other reporter plasmids containing mammalian and viral promoter/enhancer regions were tested in different mammalian cell lines. The cotransfection of pCMV-EVX1 with pRSV-CAT, pCAT-promoter, and p7B2-I-CAT, containing 524 bp of the 3′ LTR of the Rous sarcoma virus (39Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Google Scholar), 202 bp of the SV40 promoter(51Rosenthal N. Berger S.L. Kimmel A.R. Methods in Enzymology. 152.

These results indicate that the transfected EVX1 exerts its transcriptional repressor activity in cells either expressing or not expressing the endogenous EVXI and that this effect is not promoter-specific.The observed repression of CAT activity by EVX1 corresponds to a decrease in CAT mRNA, as measured either by RNase protection analysis or by RT-PCR experiments (Fig. 5"
https://openalex.org/W1996588277,"We previously described a diverse family of sulfated anionic N-linked oligosaccharides released by peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) from calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells (Roux, L., Holoyda, S., Sundblad, G., Freeze, H. H., and Varki, A.(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8879-8889). Since a major fraction of the intact lung consists of endothelial cells, we reasoned that bovine lung might be a rich source of similar molecules. Total N-linked oligosaccharides from bovine lung acetone powder were released by PNGaseF, labeled by [3H]NaBH4 reduction, and the anionic fractions were studied with a variety of techniques. The sugar chains with lesser negative charge (designated Class I) share several properties of conventional multiantennary complex-type chains. However, unlike the case with CPAE cells, sialic acids account only for a minority of the anionic properties and only a small proportion carry sulfate esters. A variety of different treatments indicate that most of the unexplained negative charge is due to multiple carboxylic acid groups. Resistance to β-glucuronidase and α-iduronidase suggests that these may be previously undescribed modifications of mammalian oligosaccharides. The most highly charged N-linked chains (designated Class II) are more similar in general structure to the corresponding ones from CPAE cells, although relatively more abundant. Their high charge is primarily due to chondroitin sulfate, heparin/heparan sulfate, or keratan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. Sequential digestion studies suggest that a significant proportion of these molecules have more than one type of glycosaminoglycan chain associated with them. Compositional analysis indicates the presence of xylose residues in Class II, but not Class I molecules. However, unlike the case with conventional glycosaminoglycans, these residues are not at the reducing terminus.Most previously reported structures of complex-type N-linked oligosaccharides are derived from the glycoproteins of blood cells, plasma, or the secretions of cultured mammalian cells. This library of N-linked oligosaccharides from an intact mammalian organ (lung) contains a high proportion of novel anionic sugar chains whose structures are different from conventional complex-type sialylated chains and only partially related to those from CPAE cells.

INTRODUCTIONThe anionic character of most known N-linked oligosaccharides is due to the presence of sialic acids(1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

However, negative charge in such molecules can also be due to phosphate esters(3Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Google Scholar, 4Varki A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol.

Robert Y. Kuchler S. Steck A.J. Zanetta J.-P. Dev. Neurosci. 1992; 14: 342-350Google Scholar). Unlike sialylated chains, the other types of anionic molecules are considered rare, being reported only in small amounts and/or only on certain proteins. By metabolic labeling with [35S]sulfate and release with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) 1The abbreviations used include: PNGaseFpeptide:N-glycosidase FGAGglycosaminoglycanHSheparin/heparan sulfateCSchondroitin sulfateKSkeratan sulfateCPAEcalf pulmonary artery endothelial cellHPAEC-PADhigh pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperiometric detectiondisodium 2,2′-bicinchoninate4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-biquinolineEDC1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide HClNHSN-hydroxysuccinimideL-PHAphytohemagglutinin-L4GC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometryCH3Imethyl iodideMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidNeu5AcN-acetylneuraminic acidNeu5GcN-glycolylneuraminic acidMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography.(17Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 44-57Google Scholar), we previously identified and characterized a diverse family of anionic N-linked oligosaccharides in CPAE cells, a calf pulmonary artery endothelial cell line(10Roux L. Holojda S. Sundblad G. Freeze H.H. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8879-8889Google Scholar, 11Sundblad G. Holojda S. Roux L. Varki A. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8890-8896Google Scholar). These sugar chains were separated by size and charge into two general classes. “Class I” was composed of molecules bearing various combinations of primary sulfate esters and sialic acids, while “Class II” molecules carried sequences susceptible to cleavage by glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes. About half of the negative charge on the sulfated Class I molecules could be attributed to GlcNAc-6-sulfate units at a position subterminal to sialic acid and β-galactose. In the case of Class II molecules, most of the negative charge was susceptible to heparin and chondroitin lyases, suggesting a novel class of “N-linked glycosaminoglycans.” Collectively, all these sulfated molecules represented ∼10% of the total PNGaseF-releasable N-linked oligosaccharides from this cell line. Further characterization was hindered by their extreme diversity, as well as by the small quantities of material available (CPAE cells are a primary cell line with limited growth capacity).Although the mammalian lung has many different cell types, about 40% of its mass is derived from endothelial cells(18Weibel E.R. Gehr P. Haies D. Gil J. Bachofen M. Bouhuys A. Lung Cells in Disease. Elsevier/North Holland, New York1976: 3-16Google Scholar, 19Brenner W. Langer P. Oesch F. Edgell C.-J.S. Wieser R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 213-219Google Scholar). We reasoned that the total bovine lung might therefore be a rich source of molecules similar to those found in CPAE cells. We show here that PNGaseF treatment of an extract of bovine lung acetone powder releases anionic N-linked oligosaccharides with some similar properties. However, there were also many striking differences, both in the relative quantity of anionic molecules released and in the fact that the majority of the negative charge is contributed not by sulfate esters, but by carboxylic acids other than sialic acids. We present here the identification, fractionation, and partial characterization of these unusual anionic oligosaccharides. Apart from the novel features mentioned above, we report several additional properties of the N-linked glycosaminoglycans. This work also emphasizes that there are very few reported studies of the anionic N-linked oligosaccharides from intact mammalian tissues. Indeed, the great majority of previously described anionic N-linked oligosaccharides originate from a restricted subset of accessible glycoproteins of the blood plasma and blood cells and of recombinant proteins derived from cultured cells. The assumption that similar molecules will predominate in other mammalian tissues is challenged here.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMost of the materials used were from Sigma.

Human α-iduronidase was the kind gift of Elizabeth Neufeld, University of California, Los Angeles. Diazomethane in ether was kindly provided by Claudio Schteingart, UCSD.Isolation/Extraction of Bovine Lung Acetone Powder OligosaccharidesFor every 1 g of bovine lung acetone powder (Sigma), 7 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 0.1 M β-mercaptoethanol) was added. This mixture was homogenized with a Polytron on low speed to solubilize the powder, heated at 37°C for 30 min, with continued heating overnight at 50°C. The sample was then boiled for 10 min and ultracentrifuged at ∼100,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was filtered through an 0.8-μm filter with glass wool layered over a pre-filter, and aliquots (30 ml, representing ∼5% of the column volume) were applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (100 × 3 cm), eluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 0.2% SDS (fractionation range 250,000-5,000 kDa for globular proteins). The eluent was pumped to achieve a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 10-ml fractions were collected. For large preparations, it was necessary to do multiple runs to fractionate all of the material. The void area was monitored by A280 and pooled, and the proteins precipitated with 9 volumes of ice-cold acetone added slowly to the sample while stirring at 4°C. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 15 min), the acetone was decanted, and the pellet was immediately resuspended in PNGaseF buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, 0.2% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The sample was incubated at 37°C for 30 min with a loosened cap to evaporate excess acetone and split into two fractions: a control (1% of the sample) and the remainder for PNGaseF treatment. PNGaseF, prepared in our laboratory as described(20Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 257-263Google Scholar), was added at a concentration, which was able to completely release N-linked oligosaccharides from a similar amount of fetuin, and incubated overnight at 30°C under a toluene atmosphere. After boiling for 10 min, the samples were reapplied to the S-200 column as above. The released material was included in the column and detected with the reducing sugar assay (see below). These fractions were pooled, and SDS was precipitated by adding 1/100 volume of saturated KCl to the sample followed by refrigeration overnight at 4°C. The supernatant was collected after spinning at 2000 rpm for 15 min and desalted on either a Sephadex G-25 or a Bio-Gel P-2 column eluted with H2O.Reducing Sugar Assay (21Waffenschmidt S. Jaenicke L.

To prepare solution A, 1.5 g of disodium 2,2′-bicinchoninate is dissolved in 1 liter of water, 71.6 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate is added while stirring, and the volume is brought up to 1.15 liter final with dH2O.

[3H]Sodium borohydride (1-5 mCi/oligosaccharides derived from 1 g of bovine lung acetone powder) were each dissolved in 0.2 M sodium borate, pH 9.8, mixed in a fume hood, and the reduction was allowed to proceed for 1-3 h at room temperature. An excess of unlabeled sodium borohydride (10-fold) over the amount of expected oligosaccharides was added, and the reduction was continued for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched either by acidification using glacial acetic acid and repeated drying with acidified methanol or by the addition of a 10-fold molar ratio of acetone over the non-radiolabeled sodium borohydride which was left at room temperature for an additional hour. The sample treated by either procedure was further separated from unreacted radioactivity by direct application to a disposable 17-ml Bio-Gel P-2 column and desalted in H2O, collecting only the void volume area.QAE Fractionation of Released Oligosaccharides (4Varki A.

Human placental β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A incubations were carried out in 100 mM sodium formate, pH 3.5, at 37°C under a toluene atmosphere with 0.5 unit of enzyme per 200 μl final reaction volume. All these enzyme reactions were inactivated by heating the samples at 100°C for 10 min. β-Glucuronidase (13 milliunits) and α-iduronidase (48 milliunits) treatments of oligosaccharides were carried out in 40 μl of 80 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.6, overnight under a toluene atmosphere. For some incubations, these reactions were carried out in the presence of jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (53 milliunits), bovine testicular β-galactosidase (2 milliunits), and coffee bean α-galactosidase (5 milliunits).

The samples or [3H]sialyl-(α2,6)-lactose (standard with carboxylic acid residues) were dissolved in 5 μl of 50 mM MES buffer, followed by addition of 10 μl of 1 M methylamime. A stock activation solution of EDC/NHS was freshly prepared by the addition of 100 μl of H2O to an Eppendorf tube containing 10 mg of EDC and 5 mg of NHS and vortexed. 5 μl of the EDC/NHS solution was immediately added to the samples, vortexed, and incubated at 37°C. After 1 h, another 5 μl of fresh EDC/NHS solution was added and the incubation continued for another hour. Control samples were treated identically except that the EDC/NHS solution was replaced with water. The samples were diluted to 4 ml with 2 mM Tris base, loaded onto a QAE-column in 2 × 2 ml fractions, and step-eluted with sodium chloride as described above, and radioactivity was monitored.Methyl Esterification of Carboxylic Acids with DiazomethaneSamples were converted to their H+ form by passage over a Dowex AG 50W column (H+ form), lyophilized in Reacti-Vials, and 100 μl of dry Me2SO or methanol was added. The vials were flushed with argon and capped, and the samples were dissolved by vortexing and cooled on ice. Approximately 100 μl of cold diazomethane (dissolved in ether) was transferred into the vials via a cannula and vortexed. This procedure was repeated twice, until a persistent yellow color was seen. The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Diazomethane and ether were removed by a stream of argon gas, and the samples were dried in a Speed Vac evaporator. QAE fractionation was then performed as described above, but in 2 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 5.8, instead of Tris base (to avoid base hydrolysis of the methyl esters). An aliquot of the methyl esterified (neutralized) fraction that ran through the QAE-column was treated with NaOH (final 20 mM, 1 ml) to regenerate the carboxylic acids. After incubation at room temperature for 4 h, the base-treated samples were neutralized with HCl. Controls were similarly treated with 20 mM NaCl. Both samples were desalted by overnight dialysis with 500 molecular weight cut-off tubing and then refractionated on QAE-columns.Methyl Esterification of Carboxylic Acids with Methyl Iodide in Me2SO or MethanolSamples were converted to their Na+ salt form by passage over Dowex AG 50W (Na+ form) and dried by vacuum centrifugation. 100-μl of dry Me2SO and 20 μl of methyl iodide were added to the samples, which were vortexed and incubated at room temperature for ∼4 h with occasional vortexing. QAE fractionation was performed as described above in 2 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 5.8 (instead of Tris base), and monitored for radioactivity. Control samples were treated similarly, but the methyl iodide was deactivated by heating in water before addition to the samples.Methyl Esterification of Carboxylic Acids by Methyl Iodide Treatment on a DEAE-columnCarboxylic acid-containing samples were methyl-esterified with methyl iodide after binding to a DEAE-column as described previously (37Karlsson N.G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Glycoconjugate J. 1995; 12: 69-76Google Scholar) with the following modifications: (i) the column and washes were scaled down by a factor of 4 and (ii) the methyl esterification on the column was carried out somewhat longer and repeated 4 times. The latter modification from the original protocol (which was designed for methyl esterification of sialic acids) was found necessary to adequately neutralize a glucuronic acid standard. Briefly, the samples in methanol were loaded onto 1-ml DEAE-Sephadex A-25 columns equilibrated in methanol and washed with dry methanol. The carboxylic acids were methyl esterified by the addition of 0.4 ml of Me2SO/CH3I (5:1) which was allowed to flow into the top of the gel. The flow was then stopped leaving ∼2 mm of solvent height above the bed surface, and the column wa"

In vivo, both CREs are occupied in the transcriptionally active proenkephalin gene, while neither is in the silent gene.

Stimulation of cells leads to a rapid phosphorylation of IκBα, which is presumed to be important for the subsequent degradation. We have recently reported the establishment of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent cell-free activation system of NF-κB in association with the induction of IκBα phosphorylation. In this study, we have identified a kinase in cell extracts from the LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line, THP-1, that specifically binds and phosphorylates IκBα. LPS stimulation transiently enhanced the IκBα-bound kinase activity in THP-1 cells. Mutational analyses of IκBα and competition experiments with the synthetic peptides identified major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase as Ser and Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain of IκBα. Moreover, we show that the peptide, corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of IκBα, blocked the LPS-induced NF-κB activation as well as inducible phosphorylation of endogenous IκBα in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells. These results suggested that the bound kinase is involved in the signaling pathway of LPS by inducing the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of IκBα and subsequent dissociation of the NF-κB•IκBα complex.

NF-κB consists of a family of transcriptional factors that play a key role in the regulation of a number of immune and inflammatory response genes(1Leonardo M.J. Baltimore D.

Members of the family include p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (NF-κB-1), and p52 (NF-κB-2).

Following stimulation of cells with a variety of agents, e.g. IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), phorbol myristate acetate, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), NF-κB is released from IκB and is translocated to the nucleus and binds to the NF-κB binding sites, thereby activating the transcription of a set of target genes (1Leonardo M.J.

In contrast, we previously demonstrated that LPS induced NF-κB activation without a significant loss of IκBα in a cell-free system using the monocytic cell line, THP-1(20Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Lack of degradation of IκBα was also observed upon TNF-induced NF-κB activation in a cell-free experiment using U937 cells(21Reddy S.A.G. Chaturvedi M.M. Darnay B.G. Chan H. Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25369-25372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations would imply that appropriate phosphorylation of IκBα can activate NF-κB by dissociating from IκBα in a signal-dependent manner. In vitro phosphorylation of IκBα by several serine/threonine kinases, including protein kinase C and protein kinase A, prevents its binding to NF-κB(22Shirakawa F. Mizel S.B. Mol. Cell.

Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that IκBα phosphorylation on specific phosphorylation sites is sufficient for the dissociation of IκBα from NF-κB. However, none of these kinases tested so far in vitro appears to be responsible for the activation of NF-κB in vivo(25Hohmann H.P. Kolbeck R. Remy R. van Loon A.P.G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2315-2318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Feuillard J. Gouy H. Bismuth G. Lee L.M. Debre P. Korner M. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the IκBα kinase, which is responsible for the phosphorylation of IκBα in vivo, has not yet been biochemically identified and characterized. In this study, we have identified a kinase in LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line (THP-1) extracts that specifically binds and phosphorylates IκBα. Moreover, we have identified the acidic domain in the C-terminal region of IκBα as the phosphorylation target sites for this kinase. A peptide substrate for the bound kinase, corresponding to the acidic domain, inhibited the LPS-mediated NF-κB activation in a cell-free system(20Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation of IκBα at the acidic domain by the kinase is critical for NF-κB activation. LPS (Escherichia coli, O55 B5, DIFCO, Detroit, MI) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline(-) and stored at -20°C. Casein kinase II (CKII) substrate (RRREEETEEE) was purchased from American Peptide Co. Inc. (CA). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) substrate (APRTPGGRR) and the wild type AR peptide (MLPESEDEESYDTESEFTEFTEDEL) of IκBα or mutated ones were provided from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Gotemba, Japan). The sequences of the mutated AR peptides are AR(S283A), MLPEAEDEESYDTESEFTEFTEDEL; AR(S288A), MLPESEDEEAYDTESEFTEFTEDEL; AR(T291A), MLPESEDEESYDAESEFTEFTEDEL; and AR(S293A), MLPESEDEESYDTEAEFTEFTEDEL. The human IκBα (MAD-3) cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a set of specific primers, GMD5 (5′-GCGAATTCCATGTTCCAGGCGGCCGAGCG-3′) and GMD3 (5′-GCAGGATCCTCATAACGTCAGACGCTGGC-3′) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cell total RNA as a template(11Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pGENT2 vector(27Murakami S. Cheong J. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a modified version of pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Expression vectors for truncation mutants of GST-IκB fusion proteins were constructed by the PCR reaction. Sequences of the primers are available on request. GST-IκBα mutant K expression vector was also constructed by PCR reaction using primers GMD3 and GMD5 and the mammalian expression vector (28Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. Nucleotide sequences of the wild type or mutants of IκBα were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing(29Sanger F. Nickelen S. Coulson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (51949) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein expression vectors were transformed into E. coli, JM109. Protein induction and purification were as described(30Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5011) Google Scholar). The amount of purified protein was estimated by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The binding/kinase reaction was performed according to the method described by Hibi et al.(31Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cell extracts or partially purified fractions were incubated with glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose beads conjugated with GST-IκBα fusion proteins in the binding buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 75 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4°C for 3 h. The mixture was pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 s. The pelleted beads were extensively washed with the washing buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100) and resuspended in 50 μl of the kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM MnCl2, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na3VO4), containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.). After 5 min at 30°C, the reaction was terminated by adding EDTA. Reaction products were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer from beads and analyzed on a 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. For quantitation of phosphorylated protein, the gels were analyzed by an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo). For in vitro kinase reaction, the partially purified kinase was incubated with a substrate in 20 μl of the same kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) in the presence or absence of inhibitors for 5 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by adding EDTA. THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. THP-1 cells were stimulated by 10 μg/ml LPS for 5 min and collected by centrifugation. Pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in the buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH7.9), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cells were disrupted by sonication and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) for 4 h. Resultant cytosolic extracts were loaded onto a Red A-Sepharose column (Amicon), which had been equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted from the column with a stepwise gradient of NaCl (0, 0.5, and 2 M). The IκBα-bound kinase activities of each fraction were determined using GST-IκBα as a substrate as described above, and the kinase activity was detected in 2 M NaCl fraction. The fraction was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and loaded onto a column of DEAE-sephacel (Pharmacia), which had been equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted with a stepwise gradient of NaCl (0, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 M). The elute at 0.25 M NaCl from DEAE-sephacel was further fractionated by DEAE-HPLC (Bio-Gel DEAE-5PW, Bio-Rad) with a linear gradient (0-0.5 M NaCl). Cytosolic and membrane fractions of THP-1 cells were prepared as described previously(20Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For analysis of NF-κB activation, cytosolic and plasma membrane-enriched fractions (each 20 μg of protein) were incubated in a kinase buffer in the presence or the absence of 20 μg/ml LPS with or without peptide inhibitors. The reactions were terminated by adding EDTA (pH 8.0). Half of each mixture was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) as described previously (20Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with 32P-labeled NF-κB binding site of the human IL-8 gene as a probe. For the in vitro kinase reaction in a cell-free system, postnuclear fraction (40 μg of protein) was incubated in the kinase buffer with [γ-32P]ATP at 30°C for 5 min in the presence or the absence of LPS (20 μg/ml) as described previously(20Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After the in vitro kinase reaction in a cell-free system using the postnuclear fractions in the presence of LPS (20 μg/ml), samples were incubated with anti-IκBα antiserum (28Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 4°C for 3 h. Precipitates were collected on a protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated IκBα, identified by autoradiography, was excised from the gel and subjected to phosphoamino analysis as described(32Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 99: 387-402Crossref Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Many transcriptional factors play pivotal roles in cellular events leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses. Phosphorylation is presumed to be a crucial step for the regulation of subcellular localization and transactivation capacity of many of these factors. Some of the key protein kinases, such as Jun kinases, have been recently identified as enzymes associated with their targets(31Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar), probably due to a highly specific interaction with their substrates in vivo. With regard to the activation of NF-κB in response to LPS and inflammatory cytokines, an inducible phosphorylation of IκBα is thought to be prerequisite for subsequent activation of NF-κB after inactivation of IκBα. To characterize a protein kinase(s) that can specifically bind to IκBα, cytosolic extracts were prepared from LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells and incubated with GST-IκBα-conjugated GSH-Sepharose beads. After washing the GSH beads extensively, a solid phase in vitro kinase reaction was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, GST-IκBα fusion protein but not GST was phosphorylated only in the presence of cytosolic extract in this binding/kinase reaction. These data implied that the cytosolic fraction contained a protein kinase that phosphorylated IκBα after binding to it. Moreover, LPS transiently enhanced the IκBα-bound kinase activity in intact THP-1 cells (Fig. 1B). The activity was enhanced about 2-fold at 2 min after LPS stimulation compared with a basal level and decreased thereafter. Furthermore, phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated IκBα in the binding/kinase reaction revealed that the IκBα-bound kinase is serine and threonine specific (data not shown). To further characterize the IκBα-bound kinase, we tried to partially purify the bound kinase on the basis of the binding/kinase assay using GST-IκBα as a substrate. The bound kinase was partially purified from cytosolic extract of LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells through three steps: Red-Sepharose, DEAE-sephacel column chromatography, and DEAE-HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”), resulting in a 120-fold purification. To determine the region(s) of IκBα that interacted with the kinase(s), several truncated mutants of GST-IκBα fusion proteins were expressed (Fig. 2A), and the ability of the kinase(s) to phosphorylate these mutated IκBα was tested in a binding/kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, mutant del-4, which lacks a 72-amino acid N-terminal region, or del-5, which lacks both N-terminal region and 3 ankyrin repeats, was still phosphorylated by the partially purified bound kinase(s). In contrast, the deletion of the C-terminal 35 amino acids (del-10) but not of 25 amino acids from C-terminal (del-9) abolished the phosphorylation of IκBα by the kinase(s). These data demonstrated the interaction of the acidic domain within the C-terminal region of IκBα with the bound kinase. To further directly delineate the IκBα phosphorylation sites, the effects of truncations of IκBα were also examined in an in vitro kinase reaction using a partially purified kinase. As shown in Fig. 3B, mutant del-9 was phosphorylated by the bound kinase to a similar level as wild type IκBα. However, when del-10 or del-1 mutant was used as a substrate, no phosphorylation was detected. Furthermore, GST-IκBα mutant K, in which six Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain were changed to Ala (Fig. 2B), was not phosphorylated by the kinase (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that the major phosphorylation sites by the bound kinase resided within the C-terminal acidic domain of IκBα. There are six Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal acidic domain of IκBα, which are surrounded by acidic residues on both the N-terminal and C-terminal sides. These include potential phosphorylation sites by CKII (Ser-283 and Thr-291). To confirm the C-terminal phosphorylation by the bound kinase, we constructed the peptide AR, corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of IκBα, residues 279-303 (Fig. 2B), and performed a competition experiment in an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, phosphorylation of the GST-IκBα by the bound kinase was significantly inhibited by the peptide AR but not by a MAPK peptide substrate. These results suggest that the C-terminal acidic region is a major phosphorylation site for the kinase. In addition, a specific substrate for the CKII (33Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not compete at the same concentration, suggesting the possibility that the bound kinase is distinct from CKII. To determine more precisely the phosphoacceptor sites on the acidic domain of IκBα, we prepared a series of mutated peptides in four Ser/Thr residues within the critical region of peptide AR and tested their capacities to be phosphorylated by the bound kinase. As shown in Fig. 4B, when the Ser-293 was replaced by Ala, phosphorylation of the peptide by the bound kinase was significantly reduced. The substitution of Ser-288 or Thr-291 to Ala decreased the phosphorylation by 20-30%, whereas that of Ser-283 retained a similar level of phosphorylation as the wild type protein. These data suggest that Ser-293 was a major phosphoacceptor site and that Ser-288 and Thr-291 were minor phosphorylation sites. Previously, we established the LPS-dependent NF-κB activation in a cell-free system (20Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This system has a great advantage since highly specific peptide inhibitors can be directly added. We have also demonstrated that an inducible phosphorylation of IκBα correlated with LPS-mediated NF-κB activation in the same assay system(20Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that IκBα phosphorylation after LPS stimulation in a cell-free system occurred at serine and threonine residues (Fig. 5), while no phosphorylation of these residues was detected without LPS stimulation (data not shown). These data indicate the activation of serine/threonine kinase by LPS stimulation in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells. To assess the physiological role of the IκBα-bound kinase(s) in the signaling pathway of LPS, we examined in a cell-free system the inhibitory activity of the bound kinase substrate, AR peptide of IκBα, as well as other inhibitory peptides. As shown in Fig. 6A, LPS-mediated NF-κB binding was significantly inhibited by addition of AR peptide of IκBα. In contrast, neither a CKII substrate nor a MAPK substrate affected the NF-κB activation. Furthermore, AR peptide of IκBα also blocked an inducible phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 6B) in the same assay. These results strongly suggest that the bound kinase is essential for the LPS-dependent activation of NF-κB in THP-1 cells through an inducible phosphorylation of the C-terminal acidic domain of IκBα. In this study, we have identified a protein kinase in the cytosolic fraction of a human monocytic cell line, THP-1, that can specifically bind and phosphorylate IκBα. The bound kinase is serine/threonine kinase, and its activity was transiently increased by in vivo stimulation with LPS in intact THP-1 cells, indicating that the IκBα-bound kinase is located downstream of the LPS signaling cascade. Mutational analysis of the IκBα substrate revealed that the IκBα-bound kinase phosphorylated the Ser/Thr residues within the C-terminal acidic domain of IκBα. This notion is supported by the competition experiment with the synthetic peptide AR corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain of IκBα (Fig. 4A). Incomplete competition by AR peptide for IκBα phosphorylation in Fig. 4A may be due to lower affinity of AR peptide to the kinase compared with a full-length IκBα. It is possible that the synthetic peptide AR may be somehow sterically different from native phosphorylation sites and/or that some other parts may affect the interaction with the bound kinase in addition to actual phosphoacceptor sites. Moreover, we have demonstrated here that AR peptide was a substrate for the bound kinase and that the peptide significantly suppressed LPS-mediated NF-κB activation in a cell-free system. Previously, we found a correlation between an inducible phosphorylation of IκBα and the activation of NF-κB in response to LPS without apparent degradation of IκBα in the same system(20Ishikawa Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Rice N. Okamoto S. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4158-4164Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show here that the substrate for the bound kinase also blocked the inducible phosphorylation of IκBα in a cell-free system. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that in a cell-free system using a monocytic cell line, THP-1, the IκBα-bound kinase phosphorylates the C-terminal acidic domain of IκBα in response to LPS stimulation, leading to dissociation of IκBα from NF-κB. IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated by cell stimulation, followed by degradation in vivo(13Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 13: 3301-3310Crossref Google Scholar, 14Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4595-4607Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 15Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A.

Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Several groups argued that phosphorylation of IκBα is not sufficient for NF-κB activation, based on their findings that proteasome inhibitors blocked the activation of NF-κB with accumulation of the phosphorylated form of IκBα (15Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 16DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the phosphorylated form of IκBα could be coimmunoprecipitated with p65 in several cell lines including Hela cells(14Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4595-4607Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 15Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Recently, Brown et al.(34Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar) demonstrated that two Ser residues in the N-terminal region of human IκBα are important for its degradation in a mouse T cell line, EL-4. On the other hand, a recent study showed that phosphorylation states of IκBα were remarkably different in each cell type(14Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4595-4607Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that the discrepancy between these studies and our finding in a cell-free system using THP-1 cells may be ascribed to the difference in the cell types and stimuli. In addition, DiDonato et al.(16DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that IκBα was phosphorylated at multiple sites after TNFα stimulation in Hela cells. Therefore, the function of IκBα might be differentially regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites. It was shown that the C-terminal region of IκBα, containing a PEST-like motif, was also important for a signal-dependent proteolysis in vitro and in vivo in addition to the N-terminal region(34Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 35Rodriguez M.S. Michalopoupos I. Arenzana F. Hay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2413-2419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of phosphorylation within the C-terminal acidic domain in an inducible proteolysis remains to be elucidated. It is known that IκB associates with Rel family proteins using its ankyrin repeat. The C-terminal acidic region of IκBα was recently shown to be involved in an inhibitory activity for DNA binding of c-Rel or p65(28Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hatada E.N. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2781-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the peptide substrate for the bound kinase blocked NF-κB activation in a cell-free system. Ernst et al.(28Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, reported that a synthetic peptide, corresponding to the C-terminal acidic domain, by itself could not inhibit DNA binding activity. Similarly, we observed that the peptide substrate for the bound kinase did not affect NF-κB binding activity in EMSA when nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were used as a source of NF-κB. 2K. Kuno, Y. Ishikawa, and K. Matsushima, unpublished results. These findings exclude the possibility that the acidic domain peptide directly inhibits the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in a cell-free assay. In addition, these studies demonstrated that NF-κB made contact with two sites of IκBα, ankyrin repeats and an acidic domain. Thus, it is likely that phosphorylation within this acidic region of IκBα may change its affinity for NF-κB. Mutational analysis of GST-IκBα and the substrate for the bound kinase revealed that Ser-293 within the acidic domain is a major phosphoacceptor site by the bound kinase and that Ser-288 and Thr-291 are minor ones. The sequence motifs of these phosphorylation sites are distinct from those of the proline-directed protein kinases, including MAPK, Jun kinase, and p38(37Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14955-14962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were recently shown to be activated by LPS, IL-1, or TNF stimulation in several cell lines. In addition, the recognition sites of the bound kinase are also distinct from protein kinase C acceptor sites, although several groups reported the involvement of protein kinase C in LPS-signaling pathway (40Geng Y. Zhang B. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6692-6700PubMed Google Scholar) and the capacity of protein kinase C to phosphorylate IκBα in vitro, resulting in a dissociation from the NF-κB•IκBα complex. The major phosphorylation site, Ser-293, is distinct from a CKII acceptor site since it lacks an acidic residue at a third position of the C-terminal side, which is essentially required for CKII recognition(33Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, one of the minor phosphorylation sites, Thr-291, belongs to a CKII acceptor site. We found that CKII substrate could not inhibit IκBα phosphorylation at the same concentration at which the bound kinase substrate blocked it. At this moment, we cannot exclude the possibility that the acidic domain of IκBα is more physiological substrate for CKII or its related molecules than the typical CKII substrate. Photoaffinity labeling by 8-azido-ATP of a partially purified kinase fraction suggested that the molecular mass of the IκBα-bound kinase is 42 kDa.2 However, further efforts will be required for the purification and molecular cloning of the kinase. NF-κB plays a central role in the regulation of gene activation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα. Previously, our group demonstrated that the activation of NF-κB is indispensable for the gene activation of human IL-8(6Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar), which is a member of the leukocyte chemotactic cytokine(41Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that a peptide substrate for the IκBα-bound kinase blocked the activation of NF-κB in a cell-free system. This finding suggests that specific peptides regulating the signaling pathway to induce NF-κB activity, such as the IκBα-bound kinase substrate, can target NF-κB and possibly be developed as a novel class of an anti-inflammatory drug.

Since the administration of G-CSF causes granulopoiesis, it is used to treat patients suffering from granulopoenia (Lieschke and Burgess, 1992a, 1992b). Investigations of the ability of ligand binding to the G-CSF receptor to mediate a specific signal inside the cell may promote clinical applications of G-CSF. The cDNAs for the murine and human G-CSF receptors (~800 amino acid residues) have been isolated (Fukunaga et al., 1990a, 1990b). The extracellular region of the G-CSF receptor (~600 amino acid residues) has a composite structure containing an immunoglobulin-like domain, a cytokine receptor homologous (CRH) region, and three fibronectin type III domains (Fukunaga et al., 1990a, 1990b). Among them, the CRH region (~200 amino acid residues) was predicted to be the ligand binding region (Bazan, 1990). Thus, knowledge of the CRH region is crucial to understanding the binding mechanism of the G-CSF receptor.The CRH region was predicted to be cysteine-rich β-structure, which was defined by its striking homology to receptors for various cytokines, such as interleukins 2-7, erythropoietin, growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (Bazan, 1990). The CRH region shares two distinctive features in the extracellular region: four conserved cysteine residues, known as the “cysteine motif,” are located in the amino-terminal domain of the CRH region (BN domain), and its carboxyl-terminal domain (BC domain) contains a “WSXWS” motif (Bazan, 1990). It is very likely that the cysteine motif constitutes a domain for the interaction of the receptor with its cognate ligand (Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990). Deletion analysis of the G-CSF receptor cDNA indicated that the deletion of the BN domain completely abolished ligand binding (Fukunaga et al., 1991). Recently, Hiraoka et al.(1994), using an Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP, malE gene product) fusion system, showed that the BN domain of the G-CSF receptor was a discrete folding unit that could bind ligand. On the other hand, the G-CSF receptor with a deletion of the BC domain still retained the ligand binding activity, although the Kd value was increased as much as 50-fold, as compared with the intact molecule (Fukunaga et al., 1991). It was reported that the WSXWS motifs of the interleukin 2 (Miyazaki et al., 1991) and erythropoietin (Yoshimura et al., 1992) receptors were essential for ligand binding and signal transduction. These data indicated that the function of the G-CSF receptor BC domain in ligand binding is still unclear and suggested that the expression and purification of the BC domain in quantities suitable for biochemical and structural analyses would be essential for understanding the ligand binding mechanism of this receptor.In the present study, we expressed the BC domain of the G-CSF receptor, using the E. coli MBP fusion system, and purified the product. The purified BC domain specifically bound ligand. Furthermore, we characterized the functions of the WSXWS motif and the cysteine residues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Expression Plasmids for the BC Domain and Its MutantsThe murine BC (mBC) domain corresponds to exons 7 and 8 of the murine G-CSF (mG-CSF) receptor (Seto et al., 1992) and contains 4 cysteine residues (Fukunaga et al., 1990a). Since we had developed an MBP fusion protein secretion system for the expression of the murine BN (mBN) domain, which contains many cysteine residues (Hiraoka et al., 1994), we directed the mBC domain fusion protein into the E. coli periplasmic space (Fig. 1) as described (Hiraoka et al., 1994). The DNA encoding the mBC domain residues was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pBLJ17 encoding the mG-CSF receptor (Fukunaga et al., 1990a), using the sequence 5′-GGGGATCCATCGAGGGTAGGGGTTCTTCTTTGGAGCCTCCCATGCT-3′ as the 5′-sense primer and the sequence 5′-GGGTCTAGATTACTTCATGGTAGGCCTCAGCTGCAG-3′ as the 3′-antisense primer. The amplified DNA was ligated within the BamHI/XbaI sites of pMAL™-P (New England Biolabs) after digestion with the restriction endonucleases BamHI and XbaI. The resultant plasmid pMALp-mBC contains the DNA sequence for the inducible tac promoter followed by the coding sequences: the MBP with its signal, the IEGR of the restriction protease factor Xa recognition sequence (Maina et al., 1988), a GSS coding sequence as a spacer for factor Xa digestion, the mBC domain (Leu203-Lys308), and the stop codon. Factor Xa cleaves at the carboxyl terminus of the Arg residue in its recognition sequence, and thus the cleaved product contains the extra residues GSS at the amino terminus of the mBC domain.The plasmids bearing the two mBC mutants (C224A/C271A and C242A/C285A) were modified by substituting the codons for each pair of cysteine residues (Cys224,Cys271 and Cys242,Cys285) with alanine codons (TGC→GCT, TGC→GCT; TGT→GCT, TGC→GCT), respectively. Plasmids for the four mBC mutants (W294A, S295A, W297A, S298A) were constructed by changing the codons for the cysteine residues (Trp294, Ser295, Trp297, Ser298) to serine codons (TGG→GCT, AGC→GCT, TGG→GCT, AGC→GCT), respectively.Expression and Purification of the mBC DomainThe plasmid pMALp-mBC was introduced into E. coli strain KS474 (Strauch et al., 1989). Transformed E. coli cells were grown in M9 medium (usually a 4-liter culture) containing 0.8% glucose at 23°C to an A600 of 0.6, and the expression of the MBP-mBC fusion protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM. After incubation for 18 h, the cells were pelleted, and the periplasmic fraction was prepared as described (Hiraoka et al., 1994). After the addition of ammonium sulfate with stirring to 20% saturation (11.4 g/100 ml), the solution was applied to a butyl-Toyopearl 650 M (2.5 cm, inner diameter, × 6 cm; TOSOH) column equilibrated with 2 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, containing ammonium sulfate at 20% saturation, and was eluted with a linear gradient of 20-0% ammonium sulfate. The eluate containing the MBP-mBC fusion protein was dialyzed against 20 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, and was applied to an S-Sepharose (1.6 cm, inner diameter, × 10 cm; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column equilibrated with 20 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.5. The MBP-mBC fusion protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.4 M and was pooled. After dialysis of the pooled fraction, the fraction was applied to a Q-Sepharose (1.6 cm, inner diameter, × 5 cm; Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.4 M. The fraction containing the fusion protein was concentrated, and the protein was cleaved by factor Xa protease (1/250 (w/w), New England Biolabs) at 16°C for 20 h in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction mixture was applied to a Q-Sepharose (1.6 cm, inner diameter, × 5 cm) column equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and was eluted with the same buffer. It was then applied to an S-Sepharose (1.6 cm, inner diameter, × 2.5 cm) column and was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.4 M. Fractions containing the mBC domain were pooled and concentrated.Peptide and Disulfide Mapping MethodsA proteolytic digestion of the mBC domain with thermolysin (Sigma) was performed for 3 h at 40°C in 50 mM Pipes, pH 6.5, containing 10 mM CaCl2. Cyanogen bromide (1% (w/v)) treatment in 70% formic acid was performed for 24 h at room temperature. Thereafter, pepsin (Sigma) (1/100 (w/w)) digestion was performed for 8 h at 30°C in 5% formic acid. The peptides were separated by C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (TSKgel ODS-120T; 4.6 mm, inner diameter, × 250 mm; TOSOH), equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 0 to 40%. The fractions were collected manually and lyophilized. The amino acid sequence was determined by a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer equipped with a model 120A PTH analyzer). Disulfide bonds were identified by detecting diphenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-cystine in the corresponding cycle (Marti et al., 1987).RESULTSInitial Characterization of the Purified mBC DomainThe MBP-mBC fusion protein (54 kDa) from the E. coli periplasmic fraction was digested with restriction protease factor Xa to separate the mBC domain from the MBP, and the mBC domain was purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). The molecular mass of the mBC domain was estimated to be 12.5 kDa by gel filtration HPLC and by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of 0.1% SDS (Fig. 2). The purified mBC domain was Western blotted and detected with the anti-G-CSF receptor CRH antibody (anti-M1 serum) (Fukunaga et al., 1991). Stepwise Edman degradation of the purified mBC domain, using a gas-phase automated sequencer, indicated that the purified mBC domain has the expected amino-terminal sequence of GSSLEP. The NMR spectrum of the mBC domain is shown in Fig. 3. The high field resonance around 0 ppm shows the extremely high field shifted methyl proton resonances, which are due to the ring current effect (Wüthrich, 1986). Thus, the purified mBC domain has tertiary structure. The down field-shifted α-proton indicates that this protein has β-structure (Wüthrich, 1986), as predicted (Bazan 1990). The far UV CD spectrum of the mBC domain is shown in Fig. 6. It has positive ellipticity around 198 nm and negative ellipticity around 213 nm (Fig. 6, left panel, at 20°C), also suggesting the existence of β-structure (Chang et al., 1978). About 500 μg of purified mBC domain were consistently obtained per liter of bacterial culture. The purified mBC domain retained its activity after storage at 4°C for over 2 months.Figure 2:Purification of the mBC domain. Non-reducing 0.1% SDS, 15% PAGE analysis of proteins present in various stages of the purification is shown. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Lane 1, the eluate from the butyl-Toyopearl column; lane 2, the eluate from the S-Sepharose column; lane 3, the eluate from the Q-Sepharose column (before factor Xa digestion); lane 4, the factor Xa digest; lane 5, the eluate from the S-Sepharose column. Lane M shows the molecular weight standards. The numbers show the sizes (kDa) of the marker proteins. The faint band above the main 12.5-kDa band in lanes 4 and 5 disappeared in the electrophoresis under reducing conditions. This faint band is also not detected in the protein of the second disulfide bond mutant C242A/C285A by SDS-PAGE, even under non-reducing conditions. Thus, this band should be derived from a protein that formed an unexpected disulfide bond during the electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3:NMR of the mBC domain. The 1H-NMR spectrum was measured on a 500-MHz spectrometer (Bruker AM-500) at 20°C. The purified mBC domain was dissolved in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, at a concentration of 12.5 mg/ml (1 mM). The arrow a indicates the extremely high field-shifted methyl proton resonances. The arrow b indicates the down field-shifted α-proton resonances. The protein concentration of the purified mBC domain was calculated from the absorption at 280 nm (a value of 2.9). This value was calculated using 1,576 M-1•cm-1 for tyrosine and 5,225 M-1•cm-1 for tryptophan at 280 nm (Goodwin and Morton, 1946).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6:Far UV CD spectra of the wild-type and mutant BC domains. Far UV CD spectra of the wild-type, mutant C242A/C285A, and mutant W294A BC domains measured on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic) at various temperatures with solutions containing 0.12 mg/ml (10 μM) of the protein in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, are shown. The optical path length was 1 mm for the far ultraviolet CD spectrum (190-250 nm). The concentration of the purified mBC domain was calculated as described in Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Competitive Ligand Binding AssayTo measure the ligand binding activity of the mBC domain, we performed a competitive ligand binding analysis using chemical cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 4A, when 125I-G-CSF was incubated with the mBC domain and cross-linked, an extra band migrating at 30 kDa was revealed by SDS-PAGE. The size of the 30-kDa band corresponds to that of the receptor-ligand complex, which consists of one molecule of G-CSF (19 kDa) per molecule of mBC (12.5 kDa). As a control, a 125I-labeled 30-kDa complex was also formed with the BN domain as described (Hiraoka et al., 1994). Both of the 125I-labeled 30-kDa bands formed with either the BN or the BC domain were competed away by almost the same concentration of unlabeled G-CSF. These results suggest that the BC domain specifically and stoichiometrically bound to G-CSF and that its binding affinity is similar to that of the BN domain. The apparent Kd, derived from several repeated competitive ligand binding analyses using chemical cross-linking and obtained with different preparations of the mBC domains, was 4-10 × 10-8M. The specificity of the ligand binding activity of the mBC domain was further studied. As shown in Fig. 4B, the presence of 1 μM (about 1000-fold excess to the labeled G-CSF) of the human GH receptor BC domain, as well as either RNaseA or bovine serum albumin in the assay mixture as a competitor, did not inhibit the binding of 125I-G-CSF to the purified mBC domain, whereas the same amount of unlabeled G-CSF competed with 125I-G-CSF for binding to the purified mBC domain.Figure 4:Ligand binding activity of the mBC domain. Panel A shows an autoradiograph of the competitive ligand binding of 125I-G-CSF and unlabeled G-CSF to the mBN and mBC domains using chemical cross-linking, as described (Hiraoka et al., 1994). Each reaction was performed with 125I-G-CSF (100,000 cpm, Amersham International), unlabeled G-CSF (Kirin Brewery), and either the mBN or the mBC domain under the conditions indicated above. Complexes of the mBN or the BC with 125I-G-CSF were treated with 1 mM dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) for cross-linking and were resolved by 0.1% SDS, 15% PAGE. The gel was exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji imaging plate, Type BA 20X40; Fuji Photo Film). The autoradiograph (upper part) of the gel from the image analyzer data is shown (Bio-image analyzer BA100; Fuji Photo Film), and the intensities of the bands corresponding to the 125I-G-CSF bound to either the mBN (closed circles) or the mBC (closed squares) domains were estimated (lower part) as described (Hiraoka et al., 1994). The upper arrowhead indicates the position of the G-CSF dimer. The middle arrowhead indicates the positions of the 1:1 complexes of the mBN and the BC domains with G-CSF. The lower arrowhead indicates the position of G-CSF. The weak bands above 50 kDa are due to contamination of the 125I-G-CSF. The numbers show the sizes (kDa) of the marker proteins. The band intensities of the mutant W294A •125I-G-CSF complex (open squares) in the presence of various amounts of unlabeled G-CSF are plotted in the lower part. Panel B shows the competition assay of the BC domain (0.5 μM) with 1.2 nM125I-G-CSF in the presence of 1 μM G-CSF, the BC domain of the human GH receptor (indicated as hGHR-BC) (Asakura et al., 1994), RNaseA (Sigma), ovalbumin, or bovine serum albumin (indicated as BSA, Pharmacia). The mBC•125I-G-CSF complex was treated with the chemical cross-linker and was resolved by 0.1% SDS, 15% PAGE. The retained radioactivity of the complex was counted as described (Hiraoka et al., 1994).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Limited Proteolysis and Identification of the Disulfides of the mBC DomainThe mBC domain encodes four cysteine residues (Cys224, Cys242, Cys271, and Cys285). Titration of the mBC domain with 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride did not reveal any free thiols (data not shown), suggesting that all of the cysteine residues in the mBC domain formed disulfide bonds. To assign the individual disulfide bonds in the mBC domain, cystine-containing fragments of the mBC domain were isolated by HPLC after proteolytic digestion. Cystine residues were directly identified as di-PTH-cystine after release in the corresponding cycle during Edman degradation, as reported (Marti et al., 1987; Hiraoka et al., 1994). The mBC domain was digested with thermolysin in the absence of reductants, and a fragment (TL11) was separated by C18 reverse phase HPLC. Sequencing revealed that the TL11 fragment consisted of two major, equal quantities of regions, which were interpreted as being MEQEC242E (residues 238-243) and LQMRC285 (residues 281-285) (Fig. 5A), in which the C in the sequence denotes a cystine directly identified as a di-PTH-cystine in cycle 5. Digestion with pepsin was also performed after the treatment with cyanogen bromide, and two fragments (BP17 and BP22) were separated by C18 reverse phase HPLC. Sequencing of the BP17 fragment revealed two major, equal quantities of sequences, which were interpreted as being EQEC242ELRYQPQLKGAN (residues 239-254) and RX285IRSSLPGF (residues 284-293) (Fig. 5A). The X in the sequence denotes a Cys residue predicted from the known sequence but which was not evident during the Edman degradation. These data indicated that these two sets of sequences were connected by a disulfide bond between Cys242 and Cys285 and suggested that the Cys224 and the Cys271 residues should be connected by a disulfide bond (Fig. 5B). The fragment BP22 contains two equal quantities of sequences, interpreted as being LDIGPDVVSHQPG (residues 211-223) and ELX271GLHQAPVYT (residues 269-280) (Fig. 5A). The di-PTH-cystine should be identified at the carboxyl terminus of the former fragment (residue 211-223) as residue 224 but was not analyzed because of the low purification yield of the fragment. However, these data are consistent with the disulfide pattern suggested above (Fig. 5B).Figure 5:Disulfide mapping of the mBC domain. Panel A shows the amino acid sequence of the mBC domain from residues 203-308, in addition to the GSS residues at the amino terminus. The boxes indicate the peptides generated by thermolysin digestion (TL11) and pepsin digestion after treatment with cyanogen bromide (BP17, BP22). Panel B shows the identification of the disulfide bonds in the mBC domain. Sequences in capital letters indicate the results of the Edman degradation of the non-reduced peptide. C denotes the di-PTH of cystine. (C) denotes a Cys residue that should be identified as the di-PTH of cystine, which was predicted from the known sequence but not observed. X denotes a Cys residue predicted from the known sequence but not observed. Numbers indicate the amino acid number of the mG-CSF receptor (Fukunaga et al., 1990a).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cysteine MutantsTo determine the effect of each of the disulfide bonds of the mBC domain on the structure and the ligand binding activity of the receptor, we mutated each pair of cysteine residues to alanine (C224A/C271A and C242A/C285A), thereby disrupting these disulfide bonds. Among them, only the second disulfide bond mutant (C242A/C285A) was purified to homogeneity. The far UV CD spectrum of the mutant was similar to that of the wild-type mBC domain (Fig. 6, left and middle panels, at 20°C). To compare the stabilities of the mutant and wild-type proteins, their apparent denaturations were measured by comparison of the CD spectra at various temperatures. The apparent thermal denaturation of C242A/C285A began around 35°C because the positive and negative peaks of the CD spectra started to decay around this temperature (Fig. 6, middle panel). In contrast, the apparent denaturation of the wild-type mBC domain began at 50°C (Fig. 6, left panel). This indicates that the second disulfide mutant (C242A/C285A) was more labile than the wild type. The second disulfide mutant (C242A/C285A) still retained the ligand binding activity. Its Kd appears to increase more than 10-fold as compared to the wild-type mBC domain, but we could not determine it accurately because of the lability of the protein. The 54-kDa band, which corresponds to the first disulfide bond mutant (C224A/C271A) fused to the MBP, was detected in whole cell extracts by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The intensities of the 54-kDa bands of the native and mutant proteins were similar, suggesting similar expression levels. However, a reduced level of the mutant 54-kDa protein was detected in the periplasm. The mutant 54-kDa protein eluted as a broad peak from the S-Sepharose column, whereas the wild-type mBC domain was obtained as a sharp peak. The mutant C224A/C271A mBC product was precipitated immediately after the restriction protease factor Xa digestion. It appears that both disulfide bonds are critical for the maintenance of the stably folded protein.WSXWS Motif MutantsTo determine the function of WSXWS motif, we constructed four WSXWS motif mutants (W294A, S295A, W297A, S298A). The expression levels of the native and the four mutant proteins were similar. Among them, the W294A and the S298A mutants were purified to homogeneity. The mutant W294A retained ligand binding activity (Fig. 4A). It appeared that its apparent Kd, obtained by several experiments, is somewhat higher than that of the wild-type mBC domain, but the difference is not remarkable. The far UV CD spectrum of the mutant W294A is similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 6). The beginning of the apparent thermal denaturation of the mutant W294A, determined by measuring the CD spectra at various temperatures, appears around 50°C (Fig. 6, right panel), indicating that the stability of the mutant W294A is similar to that of the wild-type mBC domain. The mutant S298A also retained ligand binding activity. However, we could not compare the ligand binding activity and the CD spectrum of the mutant S298A to those of the wild-type mBC domain because of its low purification yield and lability, such as precipitation during concentration. It appeared that the expression levels of the fused proteins (54 kDa) corresponding to two other mutants (S295A, W297A) were similar to the wild type, but the amounts of these bands were reduced in the periplasmic fraction, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. These two fused mutants were obtained as broad peaks by S-Sepharose chromatography, whereas the wild type was obtained as a sharp peak, and the final products were precipitated by the factor Xa digestion. Thus, it appears that the disruption of the WSXWS motif did not affect the ligand binding activity remarkably but instead affected the stable folding of the mBC domain, although the W294A substitution still allowed stable folding of the mBC domain.DISCUSSIONThe BC domain specifically and stoichiometrically bound to G-CSF. The tertiary folding of the BC domain was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. These data indicated that this domain (approximately 100 residues) folds discretely. NMR and far UV CD spectra indicated that the BC domain has β-structure. Analysis of the disulfide bonds of the mBC domain of the G-CSF receptor showed that the 4 cysteine residues of this domain formed two disulfide bonds. The structure of the CRH region of the cytokine receptor was predicted to be β-strands held together by disulfide bonds (Bazan, 1990). These two disulfide bonds (Cys224-Cys271, Cys242-Cys285) were mapped between the B and E β-strands and between the C and F β-strands, respectively, on the predicted topology (Fig. 7). These BC domain disulfide bonds are not conserved in the cytokine receptor family (Bazan, 1990). However, two disulfide bonds are essential for proper folding of the BC domain of the G-CSF receptor. Miyazaki et al.(1991) determined that the two Trp residues in the WSXWS motif are critical for proper ligand binding to the interleukin-2 receptor β-chain, with the use of a mutant cDNA transfection system in lymphoma cells. Rozakis-Adcock and Kelly(1992) reported that substitution of the WSXWS motif precluded high affinity ligand binding by the prolactin receptor. However, our data suggest that the WSXWS motif may play an important role in the proper folding of the BC domain rather than in the formation of the ligand binding site. It is likely that the disruption of the WSXWS motif leads to the formation of an abnormally folded receptor and to a reduction in the ligand binding activity. Recent x-ray crystallographic analyses of the GH and prolactin receptors showed that the WSXWS motif (which is not completely conserved in the GH receptor) is an irregular, extended chain immediately preceding the following short β-strand and is quite removed from the interfaces that contact ligand (de Vos et al., 1992; Somers et al., 1994). Interestingly, it was reported that the WSXWS box of the prolactin receptor is part of a much larger, highly organized pattern, and the side chains of the two Ser residues form hydrogen bonds to the main-chain atoms of a neighboring β-strand (Somers et al., 1994). In the present work, the removal of the side chains of the Ser residues in the two mutants S295A and S298A caused lability of the mBC domain. Thus, it can be speculated that these Ser side chains may form hydrogen bonds that anchor the strands preceding the β-structure and stabilize the BC domain. Yoshimura et al.(1992) suggested that the WSXWS motif of the erythropoietin receptor is critical not only for ligand binding but also for the ability of the receptor to exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. Abundant work on secretory proteins suggests that there is selective retention and/or degradation of unfolded, misfolded, or aggregated proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (Pelham, 1989). These results are also consistent with our results. The reduction of the yield of our precipitable mutants (S295A and W297A) of the BC domain from the periplasmic fraction is compatible with these results.Figure 7:Sche"

Oct-1-mediated transcriptional activation could be reconstituted by addition of bacterially expressed recombinant Oct-1 protein. The stimulatory effect of Oct-1 was observed only when the protein was present during formation of transcription preinitiation complexes and not when added to fully assembled complexes.

The time course of transcription complex assembly revealed that Oct-1 increases the number of templates on which functional transcription complexes form.

The octamer motif has been shown to be an important regulatory sequence in many other promoters, and several proteins that are capable of specifically binding the octamer element have been identified. One protein, termed Oct-1(17Sturm R.A. Das G. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1582-1599Google Scholar), is ubiquitously expressed, and a smaller protein, termed Oct-2(18Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. Lebowitz J.H. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1570-1581Google Scholar), is found predominantly in B lymphocytes. Although Oct-1 and Oct-2 recognize the same consensus sequence, they regulate different sets of genes (for a review, see (19Schaffner W. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 37-38Google Scholar)). Oct-1 activates snRNA promoters as well as some mRNA promoters (e.g. histone H2B)(20Fletcher C. Heintz N. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1987; 51: 773-782Google Scholar, 21Tanaka M. Lai J.-S. Herr W. Cell. 1992; 68: 755-767Google Scholar), and Oct-2 activates B cell-specific mRNA promoters(22Scheidereit C. Heguy A. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1987; 51: 783-794Google Scholar). Oct-1 also acquires an ability to activate an immunoglobulin promoter in conjunction with a B cell-restricted protein(23Luo Y. Fujii H. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 231-241Google Scholar, 24Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Google Scholar). Mutational studies have defined domains of octamer proteins that are important for transcriptional activation(21Tanaka M. Lai J.-S. Herr W. Cell. 1992; 68: 755-767Google Scholar, 25Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Google Scholar), but the mechanism(s) by which these proteins activate transcription is poorly understood. The octamer-related elements in the MMTV promoter have been shown to be important in both basal and steroid hormone-induced transcription in vivo(15Toohey M.G. Lee J.W. Huang M. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4477-4488Google Scholar, 26Buetti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1191-1203Google Scholar). Brüggemeier et al.(27Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Google Scholar) have also demonstrated the importance of MMTV octamer-related elements in progesterone receptor-induced transcription in vitro. In addition, we have shown that affinity-purified HeLa Oct-1, as well as bacterially expressed recombinant Oct-1 (rOct-1), recognizes MMTV octamer-related sequences and that addition of Oct-1 to an Oct-1-depleted HeLa nuclear extract selectively increases basal transcription from a template containing wild-type MMTV octamer sequences relative to a template containing mutations in octamer-related elements, demonstrating that Oct-1 acts as an important factor in basal transcription from the MMTV promoter(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used in vitro transcription assays to show that Oct-1 participates at an early step in transcription preinitiation complex assembly on the MMTV promoter. Nuclear extracts were prepared by slight modifications (28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar) of previously described methods(29Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R. Roeder R.G.

Nuclear extract in buffer D (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 3 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride) was loaded onto a phosphocellulose (Whatman P11) column equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with buffer D containing a total of 1 M KCl. This phosphocellulose fraction was dialyzed against buffer D and loaded onto an MMTV octamer-specific DNA affinity column. Preparation of the DNA affinity column was as described previously(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar). The flow-through fraction from the DNA affinity column was used as Oct-1-depleted extract. Depletion was confirmed by gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay and Western blot analysis as described(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar). rOct-1 was expressed via the bacteriophage T7 promoter in Escherichia coli BL(21)DE3 containing pLysS and purified as described previously(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar). The final protein preparation was approximately 70-80% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. DNA templates were supercoiled plasmids pMBPT3 and pTLS(-59/-38)(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar). These templates contain MMTV LTR sequences from -109 to +14 linked to T-free cassettes that allow synthesis of RNA transcripts in the absence of added UTP. Both plasmids contain point mutations at +8 and +11 that maintain the T-free nature of the transcribed sequence, and pTLS(-59/-38) also contains linker scanning mutations in MMTV octamer-related elements between -59 and -38 that eliminate Oct-1 binding and decrease transcription in vivo(15Toohey M.G. Lee J.W. Huang M. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4477-4488Google Scholar, 31Huang M. Lee J.W. Peterson D.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5235-5241Google Scholar) and in vitro(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription assays, HeLa nuclear extract or Oct-1-depleted extract (60 μg of protein) was incubated for 30 min on ice in a total volume of 25 μl containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mM EDTA, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, and 4 mM DTT. This incubation with DTT was empirically shown to prevent loss of transcription activity upon storage of nuclear extracts at -80°C. DNA templates (0.1 pmol each) and diethylpyrocarbonate-treated distilled water were added to a final volume of 44 μl, and the mixture was incubated at 30°C for 60 min (unless stated otherwise in the figure legends) to allow assembly of transcription complexes. RNA synthesis was initiated by addition of 6 μl of U-free NTP mix (6 mM ATP, 6 mM GTP, 50 μM CTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP). Sarkosyl was added to the transcription reactions as indicated in the figure legends to inhibit transcription complex assembly and limit transcription reactions to a single round(32Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3452-3461Google Scholar, 33Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Google Scholar). RNA synthesis was terminated after 30 min at 30°C by addition of 350 μl of a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, and 25 μg/ml tRNA. The mixture was extracted with phenol-chloroform, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate. Transcripts were fractionated by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and were visualized by autoradiography. Quantitation was performed with a Fujix BAS 2000 PhosphorImager (Fuji) and was corrected for background in each lane. For the reactions with Oct-1-depleted nuclear extracts, rOct-1 was added as described in the figure legends. The sequence of the random oligonucleotide used as a control for the experiment in Fig. 2 was 5′-GATCCAGTCTGATCAGACTG-3′. To study the effects of Oct-1 on MMTV promoter activity, we have developed an Oct-1-responsive in vitro transcription system based on HeLa cell nuclear extract depleted of endogenous Oct-1(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar). Our transcription assays are generally performed in two stages; template DNA is incubated with nuclear extract proteins to allow assembly of transcription preinitiation complexes, and then appropriate NTPs (including [α-32P]CTP) are added to allow RNA synthesis. A low concentration of the anionic detergent Sarkosyl (0.02-0.025%) is added with (or within 2 min following) the NTPs to inhibit further transcription complex assembly and limit transcription to a single round(32Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3452-3461Google Scholar, 33Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Google Scholar), and thus the number of transcripts synthesized is directly proportional to the number of functional preinitiation complexes present at the time of NTP addition. Transcription templates consist of supercoiled plasmids containing MMTV promoter sequences linked to synthetic T-free cassettes that allow RNA synthesis in the absence of added UTP(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar). T-free cassettes of different size allow transcription from different templates to be compared in a single assay. We have assessed transcription from two MMTV promoter-containing templates. One template (pMBPT3) contains wild-type MMTV sequences from -109 to +14 (with the exception of two base changes introduced to maintain the T-free cassette(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar)) and generates a U-free transcript of 172 nucleotides, while the second template (pTLS(-59/-38)) contains the same MMTV promoter region with mutations in octamer-related elements and generates a U-free transcript of 151 nucleotides (Fig. 1A). In nuclear extract containing endogenous levels of Oct-1, the wild-type template was transcribed 2- to 3-fold more efficiently than the template with the octamer mutations (28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar) (and see Fig. 2). After depletion of Oct-1 by specific DNA-affinity chromatography, the levels of transcription from the two templates were essentially identical (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Addition of purified rOct-1 to the depleted extract at the beginning of transcription complex assembly (time zero in Fig. 1B) resulted in a 14-fold stimulation of wild-type MMTV promoter activity, while transcription from the octamer-mutated template was stimulated only 4-fold (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). The observed stimulation of the mutated promoter was somewhat surprising. It is possible that the mutated promoter retains some affinity for Oct-1, or, perhaps more likely, that Oct-1 is inefficiently recruited via interactions with other components of the transcription complex. Most importantly, in the transcription system reconstituted with rOct-1, the wild-type promoter was transcribed 3.5-fold more efficiently than the promoter containing the octamer mutations, a difference comparable to that seen with undepleted nuclear extract. It was of interest to determine whether Oct-1 must be present during preinitiation complex assembly for the observed increase in promoter activity to occur. In preliminary DNase I footprinting experiments, we determined that purified rOct-1 binds to the MMTV promoter with a t of approximately 3 min (data not shown). However, rOct-1 added to the in vitro transcription assays after preinitiation complex assembly stimulated transcription from both wild-type and octamer-mutated templates no more than 1.6-fold, even after 15 min (Fig. 1B, lanes 3-5). In these assays Sarkosyl (0.02%) was added with the rOct-1 to prevent continued assembly of new preinitiation complexes, and we considered the possibility that the added Sarkosyl might prevent Oct-1-mediated stimulation of promoter activity. However, we show below that Oct-1 is fully functional at this concentration of Sarkosyl when the protein is added before preinitiation complex assembly (see Fig. 5). These experiments demonstrate that following transcription complex assembly, the MMTV promoter is resistant to stimulation by Oct-1. A complementary approach to determining the ability of assembled MMTV preinitiation complexes to be affected by Oct-1 was provided by an oligonucleotide competition assay. The oligonucleotide used contained MMTV sequences from -67 to -32 and thus encompassed both of the functional Oct-1 binding sites in the MMTV promoter(28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar, 31Huang M. Lee J.W. Peterson D.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5235-5241Google Scholar). This MMTV octamer oligonucleotide is specifically recognized by Oct-1 in a gel electrophoresis mobility shift assay (28Kim M.H. Peterson D.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4717-4726Google Scholar) and can specifically inhibit binding of Oct-1 to the MMTV promoter in DNase I footprinting experiments (data not shown). Transcription from the wild-type MMTV promoter (pMBPT3) in a nuclear extract containing endogenous levels of Oct-1 was inhibited when the MMTV octamer oligonucleotide was present during transcription complex assembly (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-5), while an oligonucleotide lacking an Oct-1 binding site did not significantly inhibit MMTV transcription (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Inhibition was dependent on the presence of octamer elements in the promoter, as the octamer oligonucleotide had no effect on transcription from the template containing mutations in this region (pTLS(-59/-38)) (Fig. 2A, lanes 2-5). Thus, in the presence of 50 pmol of the octamer oligonucleotide, transcription from the wild-type template decreased to a level similar to that observed from the octamer-mutated template (Fig. 2B). The inhibition of transcription by the MMTV octamer oligonucleotide most likely results from titration of Oct-1 from the template onto the competitor oligonucleotide. This oligonucleotide-competition assay was used to assess the susceptibility of assembled MMTV preinitiation complexes to inhibition by the MMTV octamer oligonucleotide. Preinitiation complexes were assembled on MMTV templates by incubation in HeLa nuclear extract for 2 h. The MMTV octamer oligonucleotide was then added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for an additional time prior to initiating transcription by the addition of NTPs and 0.025% Sarkosyl to limit transcription to a single round (Fig. 3, bottom). Under these conditions, wild-type MMTV promoter activity was not inhibited by the oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, lanes 3-5), and the level of transcription was similar to that observed in the absence of the octamer oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, lane 1). As expected, the presence of the oligonucleotide competitor during transcription complex assembly completely inhibited the stimulatory effect of Oct-1 (Fig. 3, lane 2). Resistance to the oligonucleotide competitor occurs despite our observation that purified rOct-1 dissociates from the MMTV promoter with a t of approximately 10 min in the presence of excess competitor oligonucleotide in a footprinting assay (data not shown). However, the effect of other components of the transcription complex on the dissociation rate of rOct-1 is difficult to assess. The simplest interpretation of the experiments presented in Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3: is that Oct-1 stimulation of MMTV transcription in vitro is mediated during the assembly of preinitiation complexes. To assess whether Oct-1 affects the kinetics of assembly of preinitiation complexes, the time course of assembly was determined (Fig. 4). Wild-type (pMBPT3) and octamer-mutated (pTLS(-59/-38)) MMTV promoter templates were incubated with Oct-1-depleted HeLa nuclear extract supplemented with rOct-1, and, at various times, NTPs were added to initiate RNA synthesis. Sarkosyl (0.025%) was added with the NTPs to prevent further transcription complex assembly and to limit transcription to a single round. Under these conditions, preinitiation complexes formed on the MMTV promoter with apparent first order kinetics and with nearly identical half-times of 5.3 and 4.5 min for the wild-type and octamer-mutated promoters, respectively. These times are similar to those reported for other promoters(32Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3452-3461Google Scholar, 33Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Google Scholar). The extent of transcription complex assembly was about 3 times greater for the wild-type template than for the template containing mutations in the octamer elements. Kinetic and inhibitor studies with the adenovirus major late promoter have allowed the process of transcription initiation to be divided into several discrete functional steps ((32-34), see Fig. 5B). The first step is rate-limiting, can occur in the presence of 0.015-0.025% Sarkosyl, and leads to the formation of an intermediate complex that is not competent for transcription initiation. For the adenovirus major late promoter, this intermediate has been termed the template-committed complex since its formation results in preferential transcription relative to a second template added later in the assembly pathway. The conversion of the intermediate complex to a rapid-start complex, which is functionally equivalent to what we have termed the preinitiation complex in this report, occurs in a relatively rapid second step that is blocked by 0.015-0.025% Sarkosyl. Upon addition of NTPs, the rapid-start complex can rapidly initiate RNA synthesis. This third step is inhibited by concentrations of Sarkosyl greater than about 0.1%. The Sarkosyl block of the second step can be reversed by diluting the Sarkosyl concentration to 0.005%(33Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Google Scholar). Transcription complex assembly on the MMTV promoter appears to follow a similar pathway characterized by steps with comparable Sarkosyl sensitivity. In preliminary experiments, we determined that 0.02% Sarkosyl completely inhibited preinitiation complex assembly on the MMTV promoter. Furthermore, we determined that a 3-fold dilution (to 0.007%) reversed this inhibition and allowed formation of functional preinitiation (rapid start) complexes with kinetics much faster than that observed if the incubation at the higher Sarkosyl concentration, which presumably allowed formation of the intermediate complex, had not been performed (data not shown). Therefore, as with the adenovirus major late promoter, transcription complex assembly on the MMTV promoter can be divided into two functional steps, a relatively slow step that is resistant to 0.02% Sarkosyl and a faster step that is sensitive to 0.02% Sarkosyl (but resistant to 0.007%). We have not determined whether the intermediate complex on the MMTV promoter has the properties of a template-committed complex described for the adenovirus major late promoter. For several promoters, including MMTV, formation of stable preinitiation complexes that are resistant to challenge by a second template requires a larger set of general transcription factors than the adenovirus major late promoter(35Aso T. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26575-26583Google Scholar). The ability to reversibly block the second step in MMTV preinitiation complex assembly made it possible to independently assess the role of Oct-1 in each of the two steps. In one extreme possibility, if Oct-1-mediated stimulation requires that Oct-1 be present during formation of the intermediate complex, then addition of Oct-1 following removal of a 0.02% Sarkosyl block by dilution to 0.007% should have no stimulatory effect. On the other hand, if Oct-1 participates only in the conversion of the intermediate complex to the rapid start complex, then addition of Oct-1 at the time of Sarkosyl dilution should have the same stimulatory effect as when it is present from the beginning of the assembly process. These possibilities were tested as follows. Wild-type (pMBPT3) and octamer-mutated (pTLS(-59/-38)) MMTV templates were incubated in Oct-1-depleted HeLa nuclear extract containing 0.02% Sarkosyl (denoted as medium (M) concentration in Fig. 5). As described above, this concentration of Sarkosyl was empirically determined to prevent formation of the rapid-start complex on the MMTV promoter. After 60 min, the Sarkosyl was diluted to a concentration of 0.007% (denoted as low (L) concentration in Fig. 5), and NTPs were added. Two minutes after NTP addition, the Sarkosyl concentration was raised to 0.025% to limit transcription to a single round. rOct-1 was added to the reactions either at time zero or immediately following dilution. A control experiment in which the volume dilution maintained the Sarkosyl concentration at 0.02% (M*→ M) effectively blocked all transcription, as expected, even when rOct-1 was present from time zero (Fig. 5A, lane 3). However, when the Sarkosyl block was reversed by dilution to 0.007% (M*→ L), the number of functional preinitiation complexes formed (lane 5) was comparable to that in a control experiment in which the Sarkosyl concentration was maintained at 0.007% until after NTP addition (L*→ L, lane 2). In addition, Oct-1-mediated stimulation of MMTV promoter activity was comparable in the M → L (compare lanes 4 and 5) and L → L (compare lanes 1 and 2) experiments; rOct-1 stimulated transcription from the wild-type template about 4-fold more efficiently than from the octamer-mutated template (17- to 20-fold from the wild-type and 5- to 6-fold from the mutant). Significantly, addition of rOct-1 immediately after the Sarkosyl dilution (M → L*) had no effect on the level of MMTV transcription even after 5 min of incubation with rOct-1 before addition of NTPs (compare lanes 4-7). Thus, in our assays, the effect of Oct-1 on the MMTV promoter appears to be predominantly in the first functionally defined step (formation of the intermediate complex) rather than in the second step (formation of the rapid-start complex). Four different experimental results are consistent with the idea that Oct-1 stimulates the assembly of functional transcription complexes on the MMTV promoter. First, Oct-1 was shown to increase MMTV promoter activity in vitro only if it was present while transcription complexes were being assembled; addition of Oct-1 after assembly had no effect on promoter activity (Fig. 1). Second, transcription complexes assembled in the presence of Oct-1 were refractory to inhibition by an MMTV octamer oligonucleotide competitor that binds Oct-1 and prevents Oct-1-mediated stimulation of promoter activity if present during transcription complex assembly (Fig. 2 and 3). Third, the kinetics of transcription complex assembly revealed that Oct-1 increases the number of templates that support transcription (Fig. 4). Finally, Sarkosyl inhibition experiments showed that Oct-1 must be present during an early step in transcription complex assembly (Fig. 5). The lymphoid-specific octamer-binding protein Oct-2 has also been shown to affect transcription complex assembly in vitro(36Arnosti D.N. Merino A. Reinberg D. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 157-166Google Scholar, 37Annweiler A. Zwilling S. Hipskind R.A. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2525-2534Google Scholar). There are at least two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms by which an Oct-1-mediated increase in the number of functional MMTV preinitiation complexes could occur. One possibility is that Oct-1 directs a more efficient assembly of transcription complexes that are functionally equivalent to those assembled in its absence, resulting in an increased number of templates on which such complexes form. Alternatively, transcription complexes assembled in the presence of Oct-1 could be qualitatively different and more likely to lead to productive RNA synthesis than those assembled in its absence. Such a difference could result directly from the presence of Oct-1 or indirectly via Oct-1-mediated recruitment of some additional factor. Both models are consistent with our order of addition, oligonucleotide competition, and Sarkosyl inhibition experiments that indicate that Oct-1 obligatorily enters the complex at an early stage. Preliminary analysis of transcription complex stability and kinetics of RNA synthesis has not revealed any differences between complexes assembled on wild-type and octamer-mutated templates. 2C. Bral, J. Steinke, S. Kopytek, and D. O. Peterson, unpublished observations. However, differences not detected by these assays are possible. If the mechanism of Oct-1-mediated stimulation involves increased efficiency of transcription complex assembly, then one or more components of the basal transcription apparatus may be targets of Oct-1 action. Furthermore, the observation that assembly of a stable complex on the MMTV promoter requires TFIID, TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II (35Aso T. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26575-26583Google Scholar) is consistent with the idea that transcription could be affected through interaction with any of these components. Indeed, Zwilling et al.(38Zwilling S. Annweiler A. Wirth T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1655-1662Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the POU domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2 can interact with the TATA-binding protein component of TFIID. Interactions between Oct-1 and other transcription proteins have also been demonstrated(39Kristie T.M. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2383-2396Google Scholar, 40Stern S. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2555-2566Google Scholar, 41Verrijzer C.P. Van Oosterhout J.A.W.M. van der Vliet P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 542-551Google Scholar, 42Kutoh E. Strömstedt P.-E. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4960-4969Google Scholar, 43Zwilling S. König H. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1198-1208Google Scholar). Of particular significance to our work is the reported interaction between Oct-1 and NF-1 in binding closely spaced sites in the epithelial-specific enhancer of human papillomavirus(44O'Connor M. Bernard H.-U. Virology. 1995; 207: 77-88Google Scholar). The MMTV octamer elements are also closely linked to an NF-1 binding site (see Fig. 1), and we have previously reported that mutations in the MMTV promoter that alter the spacing between the Oct-1 and NF-1 binding sites affect transcription in a cyclic manner corresponding roughly to the periodicity of B-form DNA(31Huang M. Lee J.W. Peterson D.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5235-5241Google Scholar). These results suggest interactions between these two transcription factors on the MMTV promoter that can be disrupted by spacing changes. However, using purified recombinant proteins, we have not been able to demonstrate cooperative binding between Oct-1 and NF-1 on the MMTV promoter (data not shown), and interactions between these proteins, if present, appear not to be at the level of cooperative DNA binding. Further analysis with a more defined transcription system may allow a more detailed determination of the mechanism of transcriptional activation by Oct-1 protein. Our studies have clearly demonstrated that for the activation we observe in vitro, Oct-1 must enter the assembling transcription complex at an early stage and that binding of Oct-1 results in an increase in the efficiency with which functional preinitiation complexes form on the template. It will be particularly interesting to determine the mechanistic role of Oct-1 in steroid receptor-activated transcription and promoter repression mediated by the MMTV NREs.

In this study, the translocation of the toxin has been investigated by the binding of antibodies to two preparations of model membrane-inserted toxin. In one preparation, toxin was added externally to model membrane vesicles and then inserted by exposure to low pH. In the other preparation, toxin was entrapped in the vesicles at neutral pH, and then inserted by decreasing pH. At neutral pH, externally added antibodies could not bind to entrapped toxin, although they could bind to externally added native toxin. However, after low pH exposure, antibodies against all three toxin domains (catalytic (C), transmembrane (T), and receptor-binding (R)) could bind to entrapped toxin, and also to externally added membrane-inserted toxin. The binding to the entrapped toxin shows that all three domains of the toxin translocate to the trans face of the membrane after exposure to low pH. The observation that antibodies bind to both external and entrapped preparations of toxin after low pH exposure shows that toxin inserts in a mixed orientation.A difference in antibody binding to low pH-treated toxin in which the C domain is folded (Lr′ conformation) or unfolded (Lr″ conformation) was also observed. An increase in antibody binding to C and T domains in the Lr″ conformation relative to binding to the Lr′ conformation was found for entrapped toxin, suggesting that more of the C and T domains translocate across the bilayer in the Lr″ conformation.These results suggest all three toxin domains insert in the membrane bilayer and participate in translocation in vitro. The C and R domains lack classical transmembrane hydrophobic sequences. However, they possess sequences that have the potential to form membrane-inserting β-sheets.

However, they possess sequences that have the potential to form membrane-inserting β-sheets. Diphtheria toxin contains 535 residues (Mr 58,348) and comprises an A chain, which is equivalent to the catalytic (C)1 domain, and a B chain, which comprises transmembrane (T) and receptor-binding (R) domains(1Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fuji G. Curmi P.M.G. Kantardjieff K.A. Collier R.J. Eisenburg D. Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Google Scholar). After endocytosis, the acid environment of the endosome lumen triggers a conformational change which allows the toxin to insert and then translocate the C domain across the membrane bilayer(2London E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 25-51Google Scholar). The C domain is then released into the cytoplasm. Hydrophobic helices in the T domain are the most obvious sequences that may be involved in translocation(1Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fuji G. Curmi P.M.G. Kantardjieff K.A. Collier R.J. Eisenburg D. Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Google Scholar). However, several studies have indicated that the C domain may also participate actively in membrane interaction and translocation(3Zhao J.-M. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15369-15377Google Scholar, 4Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3857-3864Google Scholar, 5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1984; 259: 12226-12233Google Scholar). Furthermore, the R domain, which has been thought to act simply to bind to the receptor for the toxin, becomes hydrophobic at low pH(10Esbensen Q.Y. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Madshus I.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 663-666Google Scholar), raising the possibility it has an important role in translocation. In order to clarify the role each domain plays in translocation, monoclonal antibodies to the C, T, and R domains and polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies were used to examine the interaction of all three toxin domains with the membrane bilayer. A system was used in which the toxin is added externally to vesicles or entrapped within the vesicle lumen. This latter system is analogous to endosomes, allowing the detection of translocation(5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar, 11Gonzalez J.E. Wisnieski B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15257-15259Google Scholar). The results show that all three domains traverse the bilayer and become exposed to the trans side of the membrane after exposure to low pH. This is a strong argument for the proposal that all three domains participate directly in translocation of the C domain in vitro. The observations that the unfolding of the C domain further promotes translocation and that the toxin inserts in a mixture of orientations are additional clues to the translocation mechanism. ImmunoPlate MaxiSorp, flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates were purchased from Nunc. Goat-anti rabbit Ig labeled with alkaline phosphatase was obtained by Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). Goat anti-mouse Ig labeled with alkaline phosphatase was obtained by Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA) and Fisher Biotech. Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate (5-mg tablets) and octyl glucoside (OG) were purchased from Sigma. DOPC and DOPG were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL). Anti-fluorescein whole antibody and Fab fragments (1-4 mg/ml in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 8, with 2 mM sodium azide), rhodamine-DHPE, biotin-DHPE, biotin-X-DHPE, and streptavidin were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Phast SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and PhastSystem supplies were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. Toxin was prepared as described previously(4Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3857-3864Google Scholar, 13Tortorella D. Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9181-9188Google Scholar). Antibodies were prepared as described in accompanying paper except that they were diluted with Tris buffer (15 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2.) prior to use. Antibody concentrations were identical to the antibody concentration reported in the accompanying article(12Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes D.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27439-27445Google Scholar), except where noted. LUV with and without entrapped toxin were prepared by detergent dialysis as described previously(5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar). LUV contained (w/w) 79.5% DOPC, 20.2% DOPG, and (as determined spectroscopically at 563 nm using an ɛ = 73,000 M-1 cm-1) 0.11-0.3% of rhodamine-DHPE. A small aliquot was removed from each final preparation, and its rhodamine fluorescence (found to be insensitive to detergent) relative to the initial (pre-dialysis) mixture was measured to calculate lipid concentration. Toxin concentration was measured by competition ELISA with native toxin added externally to empty LUV used to prepare a standard curve (see below). To detect entrapped toxin by ELISA, octyl glucoside (final concentration, 15 mg/ml) was added to the entrapped (and standard) samples to dissolve the vesicles. The percentage of initially added toxin entrapped within the LUV was found to range between 5 and 10%. The toxin concentration ranged from 7.4 to 20.0 μg/ml (average 12.3 μg/ml) and the lipid concentration ranged from 1.10 to 2.74 mg/ml (average 1.72 mg/ml). Given the diameter of the vesicles (about 2500 Å; (5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar)) and the toxin concentration used, about 65 toxin molecules are entrapped within each vesicle. A competition ELISA protocol was used as in the accompanying article(12Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes D.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27439-27445Google Scholar), with the exception that free dimer toxin was used as coating antigen. For α-T1 (see accompanying article for antibody nomenclature), 115 μl of toxin-containing vesicles were diluted to 200 μl with Tris buffer and then different aliquots were diluted with vesicles without toxin to maintain 1 mg/ml lipid concentration. For α-C2 and α-R1, 88 μl of toxin-containing vesicles were diluted to 109 μl with Tris buffer and then different aliquots were diluted with vesicles without toxin to maintain 1.7 mg/ml lipid concentration. Tris-diluted antibodies were added and samples incubated for about 2 h at room temperature. Samples were then diluted to 320 μl with Tris buffer, and 100 μl aliquoted into the ELISA plate as described previously(12Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes D.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27439-27445Google Scholar). Final antibody concentrations were 0.20 μg/ml for α-T1, 0.98 μg/ml for α-C2, and 0.56 μg/ml for α-R1. For experiments with α-T1, 9.4 μl of 240 mg/ml OG was added to a 115-μl aliquot of LUV-entrapped toxin or toxin added externally to LUV having the same protein and lipid concentrations to give an OG concentration of 15 mg/ml (for α-C2 and α-R1, 6 μl of OG was added to 88-μl toxin-LUV aliquots). For α-T1, 35 μl of Tris buffer was added and the samples incubated for 30 min at room temperature (this step was skipped for the other antibodies). Then for α-T1, 40 μl of additional Tris buffer was added (15 μl for α-C2 and α-R1) and incubated for 15 min. Tris-diluted antibodies were added and samples incubated for about 2 h at room temperature. Samples were then diluted to 320 μl with Tris buffer, and 100 μl aliquoted into the ELISA plate as described previously(12Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes D.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27439-27445Google Scholar). Final antibody concentrations were as in the preceding section. 66-kDa FITC-dextran (predialyzed in 8-kDa dialysis tubing to remove small dextrans) was entrapped in LUVs with or without adenosine-3′-phosphate 5′-uridine phosphate-bound monomer (79.7% DOPC, 20.2% DOPG, and 0.12% pyrene-DHPE) as described above. Aliquots of coentrapped samples (lipid concentration of 1.8 mg/ml, toxin concentration of 7.2 μg/ml, and a FITC-dextran concentration of 0.39 μg/ml) were exposed to low pH by the addition of 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.4, for 30 min at room temperature (final pH 4.6). The samples were neutralized with 200 mM Na2HPO4, diluted with Tris buffer to give a volume of 800 μl, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and then fluorescein fluorescence was measured. 12 μl of an anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate IgG (α-FITC) and, where desired, aliquots of Tris-diluted α-R1 (10 μl), α-C1 (30 μl), or α-T2 (30 μl) were added. In the case of α-R1, the α-FITC was added just after antitoxin. In the other cases, α-FITC was added 15 min before antitoxin. Fluorescein fluorescence was then monitored versus time. The final toxin and anti-toxin antibody concentrations were 1.07 and 0.53 μg/ml for α-R1, 3.0 and 0.74 μg/ml for α-C1, and 2.6 and 0.62 μg/ml for α-T2. At the end of the incubation time, OG was added (50 μl of 200 mg/ml for α-R1 or 40 μl of 240 mg/ml for α-C1 and α-T2) and fluorescence was monitored for about 15 min. A similar experiment using α-T2 was performed as for α-T2 above except toxin was added externally to LUV with only FITC-dextran entrapped (lipid concentration of 1.8 mg/ml and FITC-dextran concentration of 0.38 μg/ml) and at the end of the experiment 150 μl of 53 mg/ml OG was added. Similar experiments as above were also performed with the Lr″ conformation toxin. The coentrapped LUV had an initial lipid concentration of 1.4 mg/ml, toxin concentration of 6.7 μg/ml, and a FITC-dextran concentration of 0.27 μg/ml. For the experiments with toxin added externally to LUV, the vesicles had an initial lipid concentration of 1.3 mg/ml and FITC-dextran concentration of 0.27 μg/ml. The toxin concentrations were adjusted to equal those in the Lr′ samples before incubation at low pH for 30 min as above but at 37°C. pH was neutralized as above at 37°C, fluorescein fluorescence was measured, and then α-FITC was added as above and fluorescence remeasured. 15 min after pH neutralization, sample temperature was decreased to 24°C over 10 min, and then the desired α-toxin was added as above, and the fluorescein fluorescence monitored for 2 h. Fluorescein fluorescence was measured with a Spex 212 Fluorolog spectrofluorometer. The samples were measured in quartz cuvettes having a 1-cm excitation and a 0.4-cm emission path lengths. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 503 nm excitation and 523 nm emission. An aliquot of vesicle-entrapped toxin, or externally added toxin with the same vesicle and toxin concentration, was brought to about pH 4.6 by the addition of 200 mM sodium acetate pH 4.4 (about 1 volume of acetate to 5 volumes of vesicles), and then incubated for 30 min at either room temperature (to prepare Lr′ conformation toxin) or 37°C (to prepare Lr″ conformation toxin). The sample was then neutralized at the same temperature with 200 mM Na2HPO4 (1.4-2 volumes/volume of pH 4.6 sample) and enough Tris buffer to equalize toxin concentration between preparations. Different aliquots were removed, and (to all but the sample with the most toxin) empty LUV in Tris buffer was then added to bring samples to the same volume without changing lipid concentration. Tris buffer and Tris-diluted antibody was added to bring volume to 320 μl. The final antibody concentrations were 0.65 μg/ml for α-C1, 0.98 μg/ml for α-C2, 0.20 μg/ml for α-T1, 0.77 μg/ml for α-T2, 0.56 μg/ml for α-R1, 0.25 μg/ml for α-R2, 6.3 μg/ml for α-C141-157, and 4.7 μg/ml for α-T224-237. (These are the same concentrations as used in the protocol for the competition ELISA in the absence of lipid; see accompanying article(12Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes D.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27439-27445Google Scholar).) The ELISA results were generally very reproducible when duplicates were compared. More variability was observed when comparing experiments performed on different days. To examine translocation at lower toxin to vesicle ratios, a similar protocol was used except that the concentration of toxin used for entrapment was decreased by 10-, 20-, or 40-fold. To detect antibody bound to vesicle-inserted toxin by Western blotting, biotin-labeled LUV with entrapped or externally added toxin, were prepared essentially as described above, with a composition of (w/w) 78.5% DOPC, 19.9% DOPG, 0.16% rhodamine-PE, 0.74% biotin-X-PE, and 0.74% biotin-PE. (Biotinylated lipid concentrations were based on the manufacturer's specifications.) Vesicles with toxin were incubated with 200 mM acetate, pH 4.4, and neutralized with 200 mM Na2HPO4 as above to prepare toxin in the Lr′ and Lr″ conformations. To prepare vesicles with native toxin, premixed sodium acetate and 200 mM Na2HPO4 were added. 10 μl of Tris-diluted antibodies were then added to bring volume to 120-124 μl and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The final toxin and antibody concentrations were about 7.0 and 1.7 μg/ml, respectively, for α-C1 experiments, 6.5 and 0.54 μg/ml for α-T1 experiments, and 6.5 and 0.67 μg/ml for α-R2 experiments. To pellet the vesicles 10 μl of 1.3 mg/ml streptavidin (concentration determined spectroscopically using ɛ280 nm = 40,542 M-1 cm-1) was added and samples incubated 30 min at room temperature(13Tortorella D. Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9181-9188Google Scholar). 120 μl of each sample was centrifuged using a Beckman airfuge at 26 p.s.i. (95,000 rpm, 120,000 × g) for 30 min using an A-100 rotor. 100 μl was removed and washed three times, using 100 μl of Tris buffer followed by a 20-min spin for each wash. After the final spin, 100 μl was removed and 20 μl of Tris buffer and 10 μl of 110 mg/ml OG was added. After the pellet was completely dissolved by vortexing, 15 μl of the sample was added to a 5-μl solution of 50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 2.5% (w/v) SDS, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, pH 8.0, and 7.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 10 min. Then a 1-μl aliquot of each sample was run on a 4-15% PhastGel using the PhastSystem apparatus, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and detected as in the accompanying paper(12Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes D.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27439-27445Google Scholar). Antibody binding was used to evaluate the conformation of diphtheria toxin inserted in model membranes. Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the preparation of the two types of model membrane vesicles containing toxin that were examined. In one preparation, the toxin was added externally to (outside of) model membrane vesicles, and then inserted by exposure to low pH. In the other preparation, the toxin was trapped in the aqueous lumen (inside) of the vesicle and then inserted by exposure to low pH. In the latter (entrapped) preparation, sites on the toxin exposed to external solution after its insertion are those facing the trans surface of the membrane (the side of the membrane opposite to that in which the toxin inserts) whereas in the former (external toxin) preparation externally exposed toxin sites face the cis side of the membrane (the side of the membrane into which the toxin inserts). The ability to study toxin in both of these preparations allows determination of the orientation of specific sites on the toxin. Notice that, as shown in Fig. 1, if toxin orients in a single direction, a monoclonal antibody will only react with one preparation. Competition ELISA was used to demonstrate that toxin in the entrapped toxin preparation was inaccessible to antibody prior to membrane insertion. In this assay the amount of binding of antibody to toxin is measured by the toxin's ability to inhibit antibody binding to ELISA wells (see Fig. 1 and “Experimental Procedures”). Antibody binding to entrapped native toxin was measured with antibodies α-C2, α-T1, and α-R1. Fig. 2 shows there is only very weak inhibition of antibody binding assayed by an ELISA in the presence of entrapped toxin, indicating that the entrapped toxin is inaccessible to antibody binding and only small amounts of toxin may be outside of the vesicles. 2The possible weak binding seen in the entrapped preparation might be due to a small amount of toxin that had leaked out of the vesicles. Extrapolation of the inhibition curves to determine the amount of toxin that inhibits ELISA by 50% (IC50) for entrapped toxin and comparison to the IC50 after detergent release can be used to estimate the amount of toxin outside of the vesicles. This gives an upper limit of 5-10% of the toxin in the entrapped preparation, after correction for the effect of OG on antibody binding. (The correction varied from no effect for α-R1 to a 2-fold difference for α-T1.) This percent is much too small to account for the amount of reaction seen with the entrapped toxin after low pH treatment. (This was true even in samples tested after 4-6d storage of the vesicles at 4°C.) In contrast, when samples were solubilized with the detergent OG, a strong toxin-induced inhibition of antibody binding to ELISA plates, identical to that observed with toxin not entrapped in vesicles, was observed (Fig. 2). Another requirement of the antibody binding experiments is that antibodies do not permeate into the vesicle lumen. This is demonstrated by the results above for native toxin, but since the toxin forms pores upon low pH-induced insertion (14Kagan B.L. Finkelstein A. Colombini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4950-4954Google Scholar, 15Donovan J.J. Simon M.I. Draper R.K. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 172-176Google Scholar, 16Jiang G. Solow R. Hu V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13424-13429Google Scholar) it is necessary to demonstrate that antibodies do not permeate the vesicle after toxin insertion. To do this the ability of an anti-fluorescein IgG (α-FITC) to bind to entrapped FITC-dextran was monitored. The interaction of α-FITC with fluorescein is easily measured by the 90% decrease in fluorescein fluorescence upon antibody binding (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab In these experiments fluorescein conjugated to a 66-kDa dextran was entrapped with or without toxin in the lumen of model membrane vesicles. After exposure to low pH to insert toxin, and the addition of anti-toxin antibodies where desired, the α-FITC was added and the fluorescein fluorescence was monitored. Table 1 shows samples with entrapped toxin and FITC-dextran do not form pores large enough to release 66-kDa FITC-dextran or allow α-FITC to enter into the vesicle lumen even after exposure to low pH.3 This was true for toxin in both the Lr′ and Lr″ conformations (see below). Binding of anti-toxin antibodies (either α-C1, α-T2, or α-R1) did not affect this result, showing that anti-toxin interactions with toxin do not affect FITC-dextran and IgG permeation. These results imply that antibody binding to toxin inserted into vesicles will reflect the exposure of sites on the toxin to the aqueous environment on the outside of the vesicles to antibody. In order to determine what sites of toxin are exposed to the vesicle exterior upon its insertion, antibody binding to membrane-inserted toxin was measured using the competition ELISA (see above). Membrane-inserted toxin was prepared by the low pH treatment of either toxin added externally to vesicles or entrapped toxin. Experiments were performed both with low pH-treated toxin in the Lr′ (23°C) conformation, 4We have changed our previously assigned names for the conformations the toxin takes after low pH treatment and pH neutralization from R′ and R″ to Lr′ and Lr″, respectively. This was done to avoid confusion between the R domain and R conformation. in which the C domain is folded, and Lr″ (37°C) conformation, in which the C domain is partially unfolded(4Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3857-3864Google Scholar). The relative strength of binding for different antibodies is summarized in Table 2. One observation is that after membrane insertion of toxin by exposure to low pH, antibodies can bind to the entrapped toxin preparation. Since toxin remains membrane-bound(5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar), this reflects the exposure of sites in membrane-inserted toxin to the trans face of the membrane. The IC50 values obtained are generally comparable to those obtained for toxin in solution (see accompanying article(12Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes D.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27439-27445Google Scholar)), indicating that the translocation of a large fraction of toxin molecules occurs. Furthermore, since interaction of α-C, α-T, and α-R antibodies with the toxin is observed, there must be translocation of all three domains to the trans surface of the vesicle.5 To see if the toxin concentration affects this translocation, toxin was entrapped at lower toxin-to-vesicle ratios than in the protocol used above (65 toxin molecules/vesicle), and the binding of antibodies α-C2, α-T2, and α-R2 was measured. After low pH treatment of toxin entrapped at 6.5, 3.2, or 1.6 toxin molecules/vesicle, binding of all three antibodies was observed (data not shown).)6 In at least the experiments with α-T2 and α-R2, the efficiency of binding appeared to be independent of toxin/vesicle ratio. Since there are so few toxins trapped per vesicle, these results suggest that translocation to the trans side of membrane does not involve the formation of large toxin oligomers.TABLE II Open table in a new tab Another observation evident from the antibody binding data is that all of the anti-toxin antibodies are able to bind to both membrane-inserted toxin in both the externally added and entrapped toxin preparations. The only way this could occur is if the toxin inserts in a mixture of orientations, such that some toxin molecules have sites facing one side of the membrane, and others in the same sample have the same sites facing the opposite side of the membrane (see schematic figures). The observation that the IC50 for antibody binding to entrapped and externally added toxin preparations are generally similar implies that there is a large fraction of toxin molecules facing in each orientation. This result could be interpreted in terms of a mixture of transmembraneous toxin molecules facing in different directions or a mixture of transmembraneous toxin and toxin that only penetrates the membrane incompletely. The IC50 is on the average somewhat lower for externally added toxin than for entrapped toxin in the Lr′ conformation, and averaging the difference in IC50 values for externally added and entrapped toxin suggests that about 70% of the molecules have sites oriented facing the cis side of the membrane and 30% are oriented facing the trans side in this conformation. However, the difference in IC50 could potentially be influenced by a difference in reactivity as well as the number of sites facing cis and trans sides. Monoclonal antibody binding to membrane-inserted toxin in the Lr′ and Lr″ conformations was examined. In general, binding is slightly tighter when the toxin is in the Lr′ conformation, as judged by a lower IC50. α-C2 behavior is somewhat different (see Table 2), showing closer to equal binding to Lr′ and Lr″ toxin. Binding of the anti-peptide antibodies α-C141-157 and α-T224-237 to toxin differs from that of the monoclonals in that binding to the Lr″ toxin is tighter than binding to the Lr′ toxin. It is possible that the increased degree of unfolding in the Lr″ toxin promotes the binding of antipeptide antibodies by increasing the exposure of peptide epitopes, whereas the non-contiguous surface epitopes seen for monoclonal antibodies(17Colman P.M. Laver W.G. Varghese J.N. Baker A.T. Tulloch P.A. Air G.M. Webster R.G. Nature. 1987; 326: 358-363Google Scholar, 18Jin L. Fendly B.M. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 266: 851-865Google Scholar), are somewhat disrupted by the increased unfolding in the Lr″ toxin. The IC50 values in Table 2 show that for externally added toxin most antibodies bind the Lr′ conformation toxin more tightly than the Lr″ conformation toxin. The weaker binding of an antibody to its epitope on externally added toxin in the Lr″ conformation may be explained in one of two ways; 1) there is a structural change of an epitope to a weaker binding form in the Lr″ conformation, or 2) in the Lr″ conformation the epitope has translocated to the trans side of the membrane bilayer (and so faces the antibody-inaccessible vesicle lumen for most of the toxin molecules). It is possible to distinguish these possibilities by comparing antibody binding to entrapped toxin in the Lr′ and Lr″ conformations. If the decrease in antibody binding to toxin in Lr″ conformation were due to a change in epitope structure, antibody binding would show a decrease in binding to Lr″ toxin relative to Lr′ toxin similar to that seen with externally added toxin. However, if the weaker reactivity of the Lr″ toxin is due to translocation of the epitope across the bilayer, the ratio of reactivity of the entrapped Lr″ toxin relative to Lr′ toxin should be higher than for externally added toxin. The second explanation is seen to be correct for several epitopes when IC50 values are examined. Table 3 shows the IC50Lr″/IC50Lr′ ratio is lower for entrapped toxin than for externally added toxin in several cases, i.e. the reactivity of several antibodies with Lr″ toxin normalized to the reactivity of the Lr′ toxin is higher in the entrapped preparation than in the externally added preparation. We have defined the change in the Lr″/Lr′ IC50 ratio as the relative translocation index. This is a measure of how much a site moves to the trans face upon unfolding of the C domain, the major change in the toxin conformation on going from Lr′ to Lr″ conformation (5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar). Interestingly, a translocation index close to 2, indicating increased translocation for toxin in the Lr″ conformation, is seen for the anti-C and some anti-T antibodies, but not for the anti-R antibodies, where the index is close to 1. This suggests that additional C and T domain sites move to the trans face in the Lr″ toxin but the location of at least some R domain sites do not change location. The increased movement of sites to the trans face in the Lr″ toxin confirms and amplifies previous observations of increased toxin movement to the trans surface of the membrane in the Lr″ toxin (5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar) and studies showing a role of C chain unfolding in translocation(5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar, 19Falnes P.O. Choe S. Madshus I.H. Wilson B.A. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 8402-8407Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”).TABLE III Open table in a new tab Monoclonal antibody binding to membrane-inserted diphtheria toxin was more directly detected than in the ELISA by using centrifugation to isolate anti-toxin-bound vesicles containing membrane-inserted toxin. After solubilization, pelleted vesicles were analyzed for bound antibodies by probing with anti-mouse antibodies, and for toxin by probing with polyclonal anti-toxin. Fig. 3 shows the results of such experiments using α-C1, α-T1, and α-R2. When the toxin preparations were not exposed to low pH (native toxin), none of the antibodies bound to the vesicles (lanes 1 and 4 in each panel, upper half). This rules out nonspecific antibody binding to the vesicles. As expected in a sample with vesicle entrapped toxin, pelleted toxin is observed (lane 4 in each panel, lower half), but with externally added toxin, even the toxin does not pellet (lane 1 in each panel, lower half) because it does not bind to the vesicles. In contrast, when toxin was inserted by exposure to low pH, the antibodies bound to the vesicles both with externally added (lanes 2 and 3 in each panel) and entrapped toxin (lanes 5 and 6 in each panel), in agreement with the ELISA results. This confirms the conclusion that there is translocation of sites on all three domains of the toxin to the trans face upon insertion. 7The sensitivity of the Western blotting technique is insufficient to examine the difference between the level of binding to toxin in Lr′ and Lr″ conformations. This study shows that antibodies can be used to examine the structure of membrane-inserted diphtheria toxin. The observation that all three domains of the toxin undergo translocation to the trans face of the membrane requires a model of translocation in which all three domains participate in the insertion and translocation process in vitro (but perhaps not in vivo see below). Despite the prejudice that the T domain, with its potentially transmembrane α-helices, should be the main part of the toxin undergoing insertion, the observation that isolated C (3Zhao J.-M. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15369-15377Google Scholar, 6Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Tomasi M. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 123-128Google Scholar) and R domains ((10Esbensen Q.Y. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Madshus I.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 663-666Google Scholar) and data not shown) become hydrophobic at low pH, isolated C domain can membrane insert (3Zhao J.-M. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15369-15377Google Scholar) and proteolytic evidence for R domain insertion (23Moskaug J.O. Stenmark H. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2652-2659Google Scholar) support a role for these domains in the insertion and translocation process. Since the C and R domains lack long hydrophobic stretches, this brings up the question of the structure of membrane-inserted C and R domains. We have proposed that transmembrane β-sheets, similar to those formed by porins(20Weiss M.S. Abele U. Welte J. Schiltz E. Schulz G.E. Science. 1991; 254: 1627-1630Google Scholar), may be formed by these domains(21London E. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3277-3282Google Scholar). β-Strand 4 in the R domain is rich in hydrophobic residues, while β-strands 8 and 10 in the R domain and β-strands 4, 5, 6, and 8 in the C domain have the striking regions of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues found in transmembraneous β-strands. An alternate possibility is that these strands insert in the membrane in a non-transmembraneous fashion. It has been observed that isolated catalytic, transmembrane, and receptor binding domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A become hydrophobic at low pH(22Idziorek T. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1415-1420Google Scholar). This may mean that the translocation mechanism for diphtheria toxin and exotoxin A is similar. This is interesting in terms of the similar secondary structure, but relative lack of sequence similarity, between the transmembrane and receptor binding domains of diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A. There is an increasing body of evidence that the partial unfolding of the C domain promotes its translocation(5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar, 23Moskaug J.O. Stenmark H. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2652-2659Google Scholar, 24Wiedlocha A. Madshus I.H. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 1992; 13: 4835-4842Google Scholar). Jiang et al.(5Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar) showed that upon the unfolding of the C domain at 37°C, additional regions of the A and B chain become exposed to the trans side of membrane-inserted toxin, suggesting translocation of both chains across a membrane bilayer. The observations in this report showing increased movement to the trans surface for toxin in the Lr″ conformation support this proposal, and indicate that the transmembrane insertion of some part of the T domain is also promoted by C domain unfolding. A model of toxin translocation is shown in Fig. 4. It shows that the C domain and certain regions of the T domain translocate across the bilayer upon unfolding of the C domain by heating to 37°C, while the R domain does not translocate across the bilayer. Since our anti-T antibodies are against the amino-terminal end of the T domain, it suggests that some of the amino-terminal end of the T domain translocates across the bilayer upon C domain unfolding. This proposal is supported by protease and mutagenesis studies, which show that the amino-terminal end of the T domain is important for translocation of the toxin across a membrane(25vanderSpex J.C. Mindell J.A. Finkelstein A. Murphy J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12077-12082Google Scholar, 26Madshus I.H. Wiedlocha A. Sandvig K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4648-4652Google Scholar, 27Madshus I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17723-17739Google Scholar). The observation that this change does not occur for the R domain suggests the R domain may not change its degree of insertion during the translocation process. In future studies it will be interesting to see how the exposure of T and R domains to the trans surface changes upon the release of the C domain from the membrane. The observation that diphtheria toxin inserts in a mixed orientation brings up the question of whether this can occur in vivo. This cannot be answered at present, but it should be noted that several studies suggest this possibility. Two studies of toxin interaction with cells have been interpreted as indicating the presence of two populations of toxin, only one of which translocates(28Moskaug J.O. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10339-10345Google Scholar, 29Papini E. Rappuoli R. Murgia M. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1567-1574Google Scholar). In entry via endosomes it has been reported that only a third of the toxins translocated(29Papini E. Rappuoli R. Murgia M. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1567-1574Google Scholar), which agrees with the percent toxin penetration to the trans surface found in this study. Another study has shown that not all toxin molecules insert such that they are accessible to a specific chemical modification(30Mindell J.A. Zhan H. Huynh P.D. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5272-5276Google Scholar). This could be interpreted in terms of toxin oligomers with mixed orientations. Nevertheless, it should be remembered the mixture of orientations (specifically the minor (30%) orientation) may not occur in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2039642028,"Diphtheria toxin is a bacterial protein that undergoes a physiologically critical conformational change at low pH. This change involves a partial unfolding event forming a molten globule-like structure, which exposes hydrophobic regions and which allows the toxin to insert into, and translocate across, membranes. In this report, antibody binding was used to examine the regions of the toxin that undergo structural changes at low pH. Monoclonal antibodies specific to the catalytic (C), transmembrane (T), and receptor-binding (R) domains of diphtheria toxin were prepared and isolated. In addition, the binding of anti-peptide antibodies raised against peptides in the C and T domains to toxin was examined. Anti-C monoclonals and antipeptide antibodies were found to bind preferentially to low pH-treated toxin relative to native toxin. Anti-T and anti-R monoclonal binding ranged between preference for native toxin and preference for low pH-treated toxin. These results suggest that the C domain becomes more exposed to solution at low pH, and that both the T and R domains of the B chain undergo major conformational changes at low pH. Based on these results, a model in which low pH induces several coordinated changes in intra- and interdomain interactions is suggested. The participation of the R domain in these changes is of particular significance because it suggests that the R domain plays a more important role in low pH-induced changes than previously realized.

Diphtheria toxin is secreted by Corynebacterium diphtheriae as a single polypeptide of 535 residues (Mr 58,348)(1Murphy J.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 118: 235-251Google Scholar). The polypeptide chain is easily cleaved by proteases into the 193-residue A chain (Mr 21,167), which is located at the amino-terminal end of the protein, and the 342-residue B chain (Mr 37,199) at the carboxyl-terminal end. The A chain's function is to catalyze the transfer of the ADP moiety of NAD+ to elongation factor-2. This inhibits protein synthesis and causes cell death(2Collier R.J. Hayashi O. Ueda K. ADP Ribosylation Reactions: Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, New York1982: 573-592Google Scholar). The B chain has at least two functions: to aid in translocation of the toxin across a lipid bilayer and in binding to the cellular receptor(2Collier R.J. Hayashi O. Ueda K. ADP Ribosylation Reactions: Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, New York1982: 573-592Google Scholar). The crystal structure of diphtheria toxin at neutral pH shows that toxin comprises three domains: a catalytic (C),1 a transmembrane (T), and a receptor-binding (R) domain(3Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fuji G. Curmi P.M.G. Kantardjieff K.A. Collier R.J. Eisenburg D. Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Google Scholar). The catalytic domain is identical to the A chain and largely comprises β-strands and short helices. The T domain is the amino-terminal half of the B chain and largely comprises long helices, several of which are hydrophobic. The R domain is the carboxyl-terminal half of the B chain and comprises largely β-strands. The toxin first binds to the cell and then enters by receptor-mediated endocytosis(4London E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 25-51Google Scholar). Once endocytosis has transported the toxin to endosomes, the acidic lumen of the endosomal vesicle triggers a conformational change in the toxin causing it to insert into the membrane bilayer(4London E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 25-51Google Scholar). After insertion into the bilayer, the A chain translocates across the bilayer and is released into the cytoplasm where it catalyzes ADP-ribosylation. In previous studies we have found that diphtheria toxin undergoes a conformation change to a hydrophobic, molten globule-like structure at low pH(5Zhao J.-M. London E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2002-2006Google Scholar, 6Blewitt M.G. Chung L.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5458-5464Google Scholar). When toxin is exposed to low pH at 23°C in the presence of lipid vesicles, only the B chain undergoes unfolding. However, when toxin is exposed to low pH at higher temperatures, both the A and B chain unfold (7Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3857-3864Google Scholar).)2 We chose anti-toxin antibodies to further examine diphtheria toxin structure in order to identify the regions of the toxin that undergo conformational changes at low pH. To do this, these antibodies were examined for their ability to bind to the different conformations of diphtheria toxin. The results suggest that all three domains undergo some type of structural change at low pH. Combined with the results of the following paper(39Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes C.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27446-27452Google Scholar), this study suggests that all three domains may play direct roles in the membrane translocation step. ImmunoPlate MaxiSorp, flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates were purchased from Nunc. Goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Fisher Biotech. Goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Southern Biochemical Associates (Birmingham, AL). Horse anti-diphtheria toxin Ig was purchased from Connaught Laboratories (Swiftwater, PA). Rabbit anti-horse Ig conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was purchased from Sigma. Gelatin was purchased from Difco. Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate (5-mg tablets), BCIP, and NBT were purchased from Sigma. PhastSystem SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and supplies were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. Low molecular weight standards were purchased by Electran (Poole, United Kingdom). Formalinized diphtheria toxin was prepared by incubating native toxin with 0.2% (v/v) formalin for 1 week at room temperature (8Pappenheimer A.M. Uchida T. Harper A.A. Immunochemistry. 1972; 9: 891-906Google Scholar) or unformalinized free dimer toxin was prepared by incubating toxin at low pH and 41°C for 30 min. The toxin sample was mixed with the adjuvant RAS (Ribi Immunochemicals Research, Hamilton, MT), and injected into BALB/c mice every 2 weeks for 2 months. The hybridomas were produced from these mice by the Tissue Culture/Hybridoma Lab, Microbiology Department, SUNY, Stony Brook by standard procedures(9Harlow D. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 139-242Google Scholar). Supernatants from hybridomas were screened by ELISA and Western blotting. The ELISA protocol used was similar to that described below, except that the microtiter plate was incubated at 37°C and supernatants were not preincubated with toxin in solution. After preliminary experiments, six hybridomas (secreting antibodies we named anti-(α)-C1, anti-(α)-C2, anti-(α)-T1, anti-(α)-T2, anti-(α)-R1, and anti-(α)-R2) were chosen for further study and then subcloned by limited dilution in HyClone fetal bovine serum. All except α-C1 were derived from mice injected with the formalinized toxin. Antibody class and subclass were determined using a mouse-hybridoma subtyping kit purchased from Boehringer Mannheim as per the manufacturer's instructions. α-C1 antibody was found to be a IgG2b, and the other monoclonal antibodies chosen were IgG1 with κ light chains. The antibodies were purified from supernatants of subclones grown in fetal calf serum using the QUICKMab affinity resin (Sterogene Bioseparations Inc., Arcadia, CA). The supernatants were initially syringe-filtered and allowed to bind to about 1.5 ml of anti-mouse κ affinity resin. (Fresh resin was used for each antibody to prevent cross-contamination.) The antibodies were eluted from the column with 2 ml of ActiSep solution and then washed with a pH 4.5 buffer. Fractions containing antibody as detected by antibody blotting were pooled and concentrated to about 2 ml, followed by a dialysis against 1 liter of PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 (unless otherwise noted)) overnight at 4°C. Antibody purity was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the PhastSystem (Pharmacia). The only contaminant appeared to be some bovine serum albumin (BSA). For the worst cases, α-C1 and α-T2, there was 20% BSA contaminant, as judged by stain intensity. Antibody concentration was assayed with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma). The approximate antibody concentrations after correction for BSA were 0.14 mg/ml for α-C1, 0.052 mg/ml for α-C2, 0.25 mg/ml for α-T1, 0.25 mg/ml for α-T2, 0.12 mg/ml for α-R1, and 0.16 mg/ml for α-R2. (The α-C2 value is only a rough estimate due to its low concentration.) Antibodies were stored at 4°C. Anti-(α)-C141-157 and anti-(α)-T224-237 were prepared as described in (10Sesardic D. Khan V. Corbel M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2197-2203Google Scholar). They were stored dissolved in PBS, pH 7.1, at a concentration of 2.75 mg/ml for α-C141-157 and 2.94 mg/ml for α-T224-237 at 4°C. Aliquots were diluted to 0.1 mg/ml with PBS, pH 7.5, prior to use. Partially purified diphtheria toxin was obtained from Connaught Laboratories (Ontario, Canada). Toxin was further purified as described previously(7Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3857-3864Google Scholar, 11Tortorella D. Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9181-9188Google Scholar). Free monomer diphtheria toxin and toxin bound to ApUp was diluted in 5 mM Tris, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.0. The protein concentration of the stock solutions were determined spectroscopically(6Blewitt M.G. Chung L.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5458-5464Google Scholar). Isolated C domain was prepared as described previously(12Zhao J.-M. London E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3398-3403Google Scholar). Isolated T domain and isolated R domain were kind gifts from the laboratory of Drs. R. John Collier, Hang-Jun Zhao, and Wei Hai. Free monomer toxin, isolated T domain, and isolated R domain were diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml into 50 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 2.5% (w/v) SDS, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, pH 8.0, and 7.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (loading buffer). 4 μl of the sample was run on a gradient 10-15% PhastGel, using a PhastSystem apparatus, and transferred to nitrocellulose using the transfer accessory. Blots were incubated with purified antibodies, and after washing, with goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Color development was performed using NBT and BCIP. A 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 1 μg of a 10 μg/ml solution of toxin in the Lr′ conformation in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 (coating buffer), for 1 h at room temperature. (Lr′ toxin was prepared by incubating 80 μg/ml of ApUp-bound monomer toxin in 20 mM acetate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.5, at room temperature for 30 min.) Control wells were prepared devoid of toxin. Wells were then washed at least three times with 200 μl of 25 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM KCl, pH 7.2 (washing buffer). 200 μl of a 1% (w/v) gelatin in PBS was added to each well and then incubated and washed as above. 100 μl of a mixture of PBS-diluted antibody and toxin preincubated for 2 h was added to each well, incubated 1 h and washed as above. 100 μl of goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (diluted 1:1000 with 15 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2) was then added, and the sample was incubated and washed as above. Absorbance at 410 nm minus 490 nm was measured after at least 20 min of incubation with p-nitrophenyl phosphate using a Dynatech MR 600. Under our experimental conditions, color production was found to be linear in time, and nearly linear with the concentration of primary antibody added to the wells. Each sample was prepared in duplicate. The absorbance of the control well was always found to be negligible when compared to the absorbance of the sample wells. It should be cautioned that 50% inhibition of color production may not be equivalent to 50% inhibition of antibody binding to the wells because of the slight non-linearity of color with antibody concentration noted above, and the possibility that some IgGs bind toxin in solution at one antigen binding site and adhere to the toxin on the wells with the other site. 3 μl of 0.57 mg/ml free monomer toxin was incubated with 62 μl of various pH buffers using 20 mM sodium acetate, 300 mM NaCl below pH 5 or 20 mM Na2HPO4, 300 mM NaCl above pH 5. Sample pH was reversed to pH 7.1-7.5 with 150 μl of PBS and/or 200 mM Na2HPO4 and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. An aliquot of each sample was added to PBS-diluted antibody and PBS to give a final volume of 320 μl. The final toxin concentrations were 2.5 μg/ml for α-C1, 0.75 μg/ml for α-C2, 1.0 μg/ml for α-T1, α-T2, and α-R1, and 1.5 μg/ml for α-R2. The final antibody concentrations were 0.65 μg/ml for α-C1, 0.98 μg/ml for α-C2, 0.20 μg/ml for α-T1, 0.77 μg/ml for α-T2, 0.56 μg/ml for α-R1, 0.25 μg/ml for α-R2. A competition ELISA protocol was performed as described above on 100-μl aliquots of these mixtures. Absorbance values in the presence of toxin divided by values in the control samples lacking toxin were calculated at each pH. Similar experiments were performed with anti-peptide antibodies, with a final toxin concentration of 5.0 μg/ml, and final antibody concentrations of 4.69 μg/ml for α-C141-157 and 9.38 μg/ml for α-T224-237. For antipeptides, absorbance values in the presence of toxin at each pH divided by the average of the values for the control samples (which were largely pH-independent) lacking toxin. Samples of free monomer toxin (3.5 μl of 0.57 mg/ml) were incubated with 35 μl of 20 mM sodium acetate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.4, at various temperatures for 30 min, then neutralized by the addition of 214 μl of thermally equilibrated PBS and incubated for an additional 15 min. The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 5-10 min and diluted to 320 μl with PBS and antibody as above. The final toxin concentration was 2 μg/ml. The final antibody concentrations were 0.65 μg/ml for α-C1 and 0.20 μg/ml for α-T1. A competition ELISA protocol was then performed as described above. Toxin was prepared in the native(N) and low pH-treated (Lr′ and Lr”) conformations. The Lr′ and Lr″ conformations were prepared by incubating 2.2 μl of 0.93 mg/ml free monomer toxin with 35 μl of a 20 mM acetate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.4, at 23°C (Lr′ conformation) or 37°C (Lr″ conformation) for 30 min. Samples were neutralized with 215 μl of PBS at the same temperature and incubated for 15 min. Native toxin was prepared by initially mixing 35 μl of 20 mM acetate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.4, with 215 μl of PBS and then adding 2.2 μl of 0.93 mg/ml free monomer toxin. Various aliquots of each sample were then diluted to 100 μl with a 1:5.8 (v/v) mixture of 20 mM, sodium acetate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.4, and PBS and then to 320 μl with PBS and antibody as above. Final antibody concentrations were the same as in the versus pH section. The antibody binding was assayed by competition ELISA as described above. Similar experiments were performed with anti-peptide antibodies, except that different toxin concentrations and buffer volumes were used. Again final antibody concentrations were as in the versus pH section. The concentration of toxin (μg/ml) that yields 50% inhibition (IC50) in Table 1 was obtained from the graph of percent absorbance of p-nitrophenyl versus concentration of toxin, extrapolating when necessary.TABLE I Open table in a new tab 10 μl of 1.46 mg/ml free dimer toxin was incubated with 10 μl of a 56 μg/ml fresh trypsin solution (dissolved in PBS) for 17 min at room temperature. The trypsin-free control contained 10 μl of dimer toxin and 10 μl of PBS. 2.5 μl of loading buffer was added to a 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture or a 10 μl aliquot of the control sample. 1 μl of each sample was run on a high density SDS gel using the PhastSystem apparatus and silver-stained or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and developed with α-C1, α-C2, or α-C141-157. The binding of antibodies to isolated toxin domains was measured using the competition ELISA (see above). α-C1 binding to isolated C domain, whole native toxin, and whole toxin in the Lr′ conformation was compared. Isolated native C domain was prepared by mixing 2 μl of 1.29 mg/ml C domain and 249 μl of PBS. The Lr′ conformation toxin was prepared by mixing 3.5 μl of ApUp-bound monomer with 35 μl of 20 mM sodium acetate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.4, for 30 min at room temperature, and then neutralizing with 214 μl of PBS. The same acetate and PBS were premixed and then added to the toxin to obtain native toxin. Aliquots were diluted to 120 μl with the same mix of buffers and then to 320 μl with PBS and antibody as above. Final antibody concentration was 0.48 μg/ml. α-T224-237 binding to isolated T domain in the native and Lr′ conformation was compared. The Lr′ conformation was prepared by adding 5 μl of 1.4 mg/ml T domain to 87.5 μl of 20 mM sodium acetate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.4, for 30 min at room temperature and then neutralized with 257 μl of PBS. The same acetate and PBS were premixed and then added to the T domain to obtain native T domain. Aliquots were diluted to 225 μl with the same mix of buffers and then to 320 μl with PBS and antibody as above. Final antibody concentration was 4.7 μg/ml. α-R2 binding to isolated R domain in the native and Lr′ conformation was compared. The Lr′ conformation was prepared by adding 27.5 μl of 0.2 mg/ml R domain to 110 μl of 20 mM sodium acetate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 4.4, for 30 min at room temperature and then neutralized with 230 μl of 1:3.6 (v/v) mixture of 200 mM Na2HPO4 and PBS. The same acetate and PBS were premixed and then added to the R domain to obtain native R domain. Aliquots of both preparations were then made up to 210 μl with the same mix of buffers and then diluted to 220 μl with PBS and antibody as above. Final antibody concentration was 0.045 μg/ml. Western blotting was used to epitope map monoclonal antibody binding sites on toxin molecules using reduced toxin (which gives bands for the A and B chain as well as whole unnicked toxin), isolated T domain, and isolated R domain (Fig. 1). Three types of antibodies were found: anti-A chain antibodies, which bound to whole toxin and A chain (C domain); anti-T domain antibodies, which bound whole toxin, B chain, and isolated T domain; and anti-R domain antibodies, which bound to whole toxin, B chain and isolated R domain. Two antibodies against each domain (named α-C1, α-C2, α-T1, α-T2, α-R1, and α-R2) were chosen for further study. In addition, the binding of the previously prepared (10Sesardic D. Khan V. Corbel M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2197-2203Google Scholar) anti-peptide antibodies α-C141-157 and α-T224-237 to toxin was studied. 3α-C141-157 was generated against a peptide corresponding to residues 141-157 of the toxin sequence, but mainly binds to residues 145-149. α-T224-237 was generated against a peptide corresponding to residues 224-237 of the toxin sequence, but mainly binds to residues 231-236(10Sesardic D. Khan V. Corbel M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2197-2203Google Scholar). Higher resolution epitope mapping was performed with trypsin-cleaved toxin. Incubating native toxin with trypsin results in the cleavage of the C domain between Lys-39 and Ser-40(12Zhao J.-M. London E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3398-3403Google Scholar). Western blotting of trypsin-cleaved toxin showed monoclonal anti-C domain antibodies did not bind to the 40-193 fragment (Fig. 2), although as expected α-C141-157 did bind. This suggests part of the epitope for α-C1 and α-C2 lies on residues 1-39, although not all of the epitope may be within this region. Epitopes were also mapped with cysteine cleavage reagent 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid. Antibody binding to cleavage products of mutant toxins in which a single cysteine was substituted for either Glu-162 or Ser-337 was examined. Anti-C antibodies bound to the 1-161 fragment, but not to the 162-535 fragment, and anti-T domain antibodies bound to the 1-336 fragment but not the 337-565 fragment (data not shown). This suggests that the anti-C domain antibodies bind between residues 1 and 161, and the anti-T domain antibodies bind between residues 194 and 336. Additional data on epitope locations comes from the results of antibody binding to octapeptides that cover the entire sequence of the B chain (10Sesardic D. Khan V. Corbel M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2197-2203Google Scholar). The α-R1 antibody binding profile shows an affinity for octapeptides with sequences identical to the loop region between the T and R domain and residues 486-500 (RB8) (data not shown). The binding profile of α-R2, together with hydroxylamine cleavage patterns (data not shown), suggests α-R2 binds residues 454-465 (RB6). Diphtheria toxin undergoes a conformational change at pH 5.3 that plays a critical role in its entry into cells (4London E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 25-51Google Scholar) (see Introduction). Above pH 5 the toxin remains in the native(N) state, but after exposure to low pH at 23°C, the toxin undergoes a partial unfolding process that results in its taking on a hydrophobic, membrane-inserting conformation(5Zhao J.-M. London E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2002-2006Google Scholar, 6Blewitt M.G. Chung L.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5458-5464Google Scholar, 7Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1245-1253Google Scholar). In this conformation, the B chain has undergone a partial unfolding process but the C domain remains folded(7Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3857-3864Google Scholar). In order to further characterize the changes that the toxin undergoes at low pH, the pH dependence of antibody binding to toxin was studied. As with many antibodies, anti-toxin binding at low pH was found to be too weak to measure. Therefore, binding was examined after low pH was reversed to neutral. Under these conditions previous studies have shown the toxin maintains the structural changes that occur at low pH(7Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3857-3864Google Scholar). (This low pH-treated state is called the Lr′ conformation.2) To measure the dependence of antibody binding on the pH at which toxin is incubated, toxin was preincubated at various pH values in solution and its antibody binding measured by a competition ELISA after pH neutralization. In this assay the amount of antibody binding to the toxin in solution is measured by its inhibition of antibody binding to toxin-coated wells(21Ogata M. Pastan I. Fitzgerald D. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 407-414Google Scholar). The amount of antibody bound to the wells is assayed by the amount of p-nitrophenyl absorbance generated after incubation of the wells with an alkaline phosphate conjugated to an anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig and addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The more antibody bound to the toxin in solution, the less binds to the wells, and the lower the absorbance value measured.4 The degree of inhibition of antibody binding to ELISA plates by toxin in solution was quantitated through the decrease in ELISA absorbance in the presence of toxin relative to the controls lacking toxin. Fig. 3A illustrates effect of the pH at which toxin is incubated upon anti-C binding. α-C1, α-C2, and α-C141-157 behave similarly in that their binding is stronger to low pH-treated toxin, with a sharp transition in binding near pH 5, the value at which the low pH-induced change in toxin conformation has been shown to occur(5Zhao J.-M. London E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2002-2006Google Scholar, 6Blewitt M.G. Chung L.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5458-5464Google Scholar, 20Chung L.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1245-1253Google Scholar). Antibody binding to toxin can be quantified by the comparison of the concentration of toxin sufficient to inhibit the ELISA color reaction by 50% (IC50) (Fig. 4, A and B, and 5A). The IC50 values derived from these experiments are given in Table 1 and show the difference in binding to low pH-treated (Lr′ conformation) and native toxin is greatest in the case of α-C1 (about 30-fold), but is also significant for the other anti-C antibodies (about 2.5-fold).Figure 4:Assay of monoclonal antibody binding to the native(N) and low pH-treated (Lr′) conformations of toxin using competition ELISA. The inhibition of antibody binding to ELISA plates obtained by preincubating antibody and N (•) or Lr′ toxin (○) in solution was measured through the decrease in absorbance. Antibodies used were as follows: A, α-C1; B, α-C2; C, α-T1; D, α-T2; E, α-R1; F, α-R2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Similar experiments were performed with anti-T domain antibodies. Fig. 3B illustrates the effect of pH at which toxin is incubated upon anti-T binding. α-T1, α-T2, and α-T224-237 each react differently with native toxin and low pH-treated toxin. α-T1 shows no significant dependence on the pH at which toxin was preincubated. This is confirmed by the observation that IC50s for native and low pH-treated (Lr′) toxin binding by α-T1 are the same (Fig. 4C and Table 1). α-T2 antibody binds to native toxin more strongly than low pH-treated toxin with about a 7-fold preference for native toxin (Fig. 4D and Table 1). Again, there is a transition at pH 5 between the strongly and weakly bound toxin conformations. In contrast, α-T224-237 binds to the low pH-treated toxin more strongly (13-fold) than to native toxin (Fig. 5B and Table 1), although again with a transition at pH 5 (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C illustrates the effect of pH at which toxin is incubated upon anti-R binding. pH has an opposite effect on α-R1 and α-R2 binding to toxin. α-R1 binds native toxin more strongly than low pH-treated (Lr′) toxin (Fig. 4E), with a 5-fold preference for native toxin (Table 1). α-R2 binds low pH-treated toxin more strongly than native toxin (Fig. 4F), with a 2.2-fold preference for the former (Table 1). Binding of several antibodies to isolated domains was also measured. Isolated T and R domains appear to take on native and low pH-induced conformations similar to those they have in whole toxin(22Zhan H. Choe S. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Eisenberg D. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11254-11263Google Scholar, 23Esbensen Q.Y. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Madshus I.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 663-666Google Scholar).)5 Therefore, antibody binding to native and low pH-treated domains could be studied. The isolated domain binding of α-T and α-R antibodies that prefer binding the low pH-treated whole toxin was measured to see if the increased binding at low pH is due to increased exposure of their epitopes due to a loss of interdomain interactions, or due to changes within the domain. Fig. 6 shows α-T224-237 binding to isolated T domain and α-R2 binding to the R domain have the preferential binding to low pH-treated protein seen in whole toxin, supporting the latter proposal. Isolated C domain takes on a conformation similar to that in whole toxin (24Zhao J.-M. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15369-15377Google Scholar, 25Weiss M.S. Blanke S.R. Collier R.J. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 773-781Google Scholar) and undergoes only reversible changes at low pH, and thus can only be studied in the native state. α-C1 binding to isolated native C domain was also measured and found to be much more similar to the strong binding of C domain in low pH-treated whole toxin rather than the weaker binding of C domain in native whole toxin (Fig. 6). Above 26°C at low pH (4.5) diphtheria toxin undergoes a change in conformation to a structure in which, in addition to the partial unfolding seen in the B chain at low pH, the C domain partly unfolds(7Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3857-3864Google Scholar). After pH neutralization, this conformation is called the Lr″ conformation. The relative role in translocation of the Lr″ toxin and the above-studied Lr′ toxin, which predominates at lower temperatures, remains unresolved(26Jiang J.X. Chung L.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24003-24010Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to examine the difference between these conformations by antibody binding. The competition ELISA was used to examine the binding of α-C1 and α-T1 to toxin preincubated at various temperatures (Fig. 7). A transition is seen close to 26°C for both antibodies, showing that antibody binding responds to the Lr′ to Lr″ conformational change. An ELISA competition assay was then performed with all of the antibodies using toxin in the Lr″ conformation. The IC50 values obtained are given in Table 1 and show that all the antibodies reacted 2-9-fold more strongly with the Lr′ toxin than with the Lr″ toxin. We attribute this partly to steric blocking arising from aggregation of the toxin hiding epitopes in the Lr″ conformation (see “Discussion”). Binding of anti-diphtheria toxin monoclonal antibodies to the toxin has previously been studied in other laboratories(27Hayakawa S. Uchida T. Mekada E. Moynihan M.R. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4311-4317Google Scholar, 28Yoshimori T. Yamada M. Sugawa H. Mekada E. Uchida T. Okada Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 151: 344-353Google Scholar, 29Zucker D.R. Murphy J.R. Mol.

Immun. 1993; 61: 994-1003Google Scholar) which have found that monoclonal antibodies that bind to various sites on the toxin can be obtained. The studies of Zucker and Murphy(29Zucker D.R. Murphy J.R. Mol. Immunol. 1984; 21: 785-793Google Scholar, 30Zucker D.R. Murphy J.R. Pappenheimer Jr., A.M. Mol. Immunol. 1984; 21: 795-800Google Scholar) tried to designate function to a particular area of the toxin by examining which functions were blocked by antibodies, but did not examine the effect of pH on toxin behavior. A study by Rolf and Eidels (33Rolf J.M. Eidels L. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 994-1003Google Scholar) did identify some monoclonals that bind to low pH-treated toxin, but the number of pH values chosen for binding studies were insufficient to determine whether the pH-dependent change in binding they observed corresponded to the conformational transition at pH 5. Furthermore, the dependence of binding on pH was weak, perhaps reflecting the sensitivity of the immunoprecipitation method used. In this study, antibodies to each domain of the toxin have been identified. These studies show that the binding of monoclonal and antipeptide antibodies can respond strongly to conformational changes in diphtheria toxin. Such antibodies should be useful tools for establishing whether toxin mutants fold and undergo conformational changes similar to those in whole toxin. Just as important, these studies provide some new insights into the mechanism of diphtheria toxin insertion into membranes. One central observation in this study is that changes in all three domains occur at low pH. One obvious question is what changes are occurring in each of the domains? This is complicated to answer because several factors can influence antibody binding. A difference in antibody binding to two conformations could result from a difference in exposure of an epitope, or a change of an epitope into a conformation that is more weakly or tightly bound. Furthermore, a change in exposure of an epitope could be due to a change in the position or conformation of a sequence of a neighboring domain, or intermolecular aggregation. Despite these difficulties, the changes in antibody binding to toxin do provide some interesting details to what is occurring at low pH. Let us first consider the behavior of the toxin in the Lr′ conformation. Previous studies have shown that although there is some partial unfolding of the B chain in this conformation the C domain (A chain) remains folded(7Jiang J.X. Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3857-3864Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased binding to low pH-treated toxin found for all three anti-C antibodies examined indicates there is increased exposure of the epitopes on the C domain to solution after low pH treatment. This suggests that the degree of contact between the C domain and the B chain (T plus R domains) must decrease at low pH. A related possibility is that the C domain undergoes a small conformational change that promotes antibody binding. In fact, a small conformational change in residues 66-78 and 169-176 has been seen in isolated C domain relative to whole toxin by crystallography(25Weiss M.S. Blanke S.R. Collier R.J. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 773-781Google Scholar), and is believed to be due to the loss of C domain interactions with the T domain. It is possible that our monoclonal antibodies bind C domain in whole toxin exposed to low pH more tightly due to a similar loss of C domain-T domain interactions. However, a more general increase in exposure at low pH is also very likely because the α-C141-157, which does not involve the residues that change structure upon loss of T domain interaction, also binds more tightly at low pH. This conclusion is consistent with evidence that the interactions between the C and R domain are lost at low pH(34Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1464-1475Google Scholar). Additional changes occur in the T and R domain. The observation that the differences between the binding of some antibodies to these domains in the native and low pH-treated states are seen with isolated domains as well as whole toxin indicate that they are not solely due to changes in interdomain interactions, and probably reflect conformational changes within each of these domains at low pH. It is likely that there are conformational changes in these domains due to partial unfolding and exposing hydrophobic surfaces at low pH(12Zhao J.-M. London E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3398-3403Google Scholar, 22Zhan H. Choe S. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Eisenberg D. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11254-11263Google Scholar). This conformational change would decrease the recognition to low pH-treated toxin of antibodies such as α-R1 because the epitope would become hidden or change conformation. The same conformational change could cause increase antibody binding to low pH-treated toxin for antibodies such as α-T224-237 and α-R2 due to increased exposure or due to cooperative binding to low pH induced toxin aligomers (although see below). For all of the antibodies tested, it appeared that binding to toxin in the Lr″ conformation was less than binding to the Lr′ conformation. It is likely that in solution strong aggregation of the toxin in the Lr″ conformation generally decreases antibody binding to this conformation of the toxin. Previous studies have shown that the hydrophobic behavior of diphtheria toxin at low pH induces its aggregation in solution(6Blewitt M.G. Chung L.A. London E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5458-5464Google Scholar, 35Collins C.M. Collier R.J. UCLA Symp. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 45: 41-52Google Scholar). The observation that membrane insertion, which should eliminate the presence of aggregates held together by hydrophobic interactions, greatly increases antibody binding to the Lr″ conformation (see accompanying paper(39Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes C.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27446-27452Google Scholar)) supports the proposal that aggregation in solution influences antibody binding. In contrast, aggregation does not seem to be a major influence on antibody binding to toxin in the Lr′ conformation because the antibody binding to Lr′ toxin in solution and inserted in model membranes is generally similar (compare Table 1 of the present report to Table II in (39Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes C.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27446-27452Google Scholar)). 6Comparison of Table 1 in this report and Table II in the accompanying paper (39Tortorella D. Sesardic D. Dawes C.S. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27446-27452Google Scholar) generally shows a similar IC50 for Lr′ conformation toxin in solution compared to Lr′ toxin externally added to vesicles for several monoclonal antibodies. Comparison of results with and without lipid vesicles present is valid because the same monoclonal antibody concentrations were used in the solution and membrane-inserted toxin experiments, and other conditions were very similar except for a slight variation in salts used. Based on the changes observed in diphtheria toxin at low pH, a schematic model summarizing the changes in toxin structure leading to membrane insertion can be proposed. The first stage would involve the loss of interactions between C and R domains, proposed by Bennett and Eisenberg(34Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1464-1475Google Scholar). The next step would involve the major conformational changes observed in both the T and R domain, greatly increasing their hydrophobicity (Fig. 8). These conformational changes suggest that interactions between all three domains would break or become much weaker. This would also result in sites on all three domains becoming exposed to the aqueous environment after treatment with low pH, which could aid in membrane insertion. The unfolding of the C domain into a hydrophobic conformation, which requires slightly more extreme conditions, may also occur at this time. Thus a number of coordinated changes may play a role in the membrane insertion process. The observation of low pH-induced conformational changes in the R domain is important because it implies that the R domain plays an important role in insertion, rather than just functioning in binding to the cellular receptor(36Rolf J.M. Gaudin H.M. Eidels L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7331-7337Google Scholar, 37Mekada E. Senoh H. Iwamoto R. Okada Y. Uchida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20457-20462Google Scholar, 38Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Google Scholar). This is reinforced by the recent observation that the R domain becomes hydrophobic at low pH(23Esbensen Q.Y. Falnes P.O. Olsnes S. Madshus I.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 663-666Google Scholar), and the results in the accompanying report, showing that the R domain inserts into model membranes in a fashion such that some sites translocate across the bilayer.

Mutations in which terminator sequences in these ribosomal RNA genes are deleted completely result in highly unstable transcripts, which are not properly processed and integrated into stable ribosome structure. Mutations that retard RNA processing by extending the 3′ external transcribed spacer or by introducing additional secondary structure in the spacers have a similar effect on stable transcript integration.

The results indicate that proper termination coupled with efficient rRNA processing acts as a “quality control” process, which helps to ensure that only normal rRNA precursors are effectively processed and assembled into active ribosomes. It is generally assumed that the termination of RNA transcription, even when genes are tandemly arranged, is largely an economic consideration, which leads to a conservation of cellular energy and allows for individual gene regulation. The wide distribution of often very large introns, which are rapidly discarded after transcription and RNA splicing, appears to make this measure less important, and it is surprising that with tandemly arranged highly repeated genes such as the rDNA, in which transcribed spacers actually can be longer than the non-transcribed regions, the termination signal is repeated (1Kuhn A.

Furthermore, in another tandemly arranged family, the genes encoding the 5 S rRNA, termination occurs only a few nucleotides after the 5 S rRNA sequence with a complex processing scheme essential for a mature RNA product(5Rubin G.M. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1975; 6: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,6Jacq B. Jourdan R. Jourdan B.R. J. Mol.

Both features clearly are not consistent with an economical use of cellular energy but still are widely conserved in eukaryotic organisms. In recent studies on eukaryotic ribosome biosynthesis and rRNA processing, we have been expressing mutant genes in vivo in order to identify important structural features in the transcripts that contribute to rRNA function and ribosome assembly. Efficiently expressed “tagged” RNA systems have been developed for both the yeast 5 S rRNA gene (8Van Ryk D.I. Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol.

These can result in cellular RNA and ribosome populations that are 50-90% mutant with no adverse effects on cellular growth or function. In the course of these studies, we have been making changes in the 3′ external transcribed spacers (3′-ETS) 1The abbreviations used are: ETSexternal transcribed spacersPCRpolymerase chain reactionpolpolymerase. 1The abbreviations used are: ETSexternal transcribed spacersPCRpolymerase chain reactionpolpolymerase.and termination regions to determine specific features that affect 3′-ETS processing (e.g.(12Melekhovets Y.F.

The changes have included controls in which the termination signals have been altered or removed entirely. Here we report that the yields of the mature RNAs are severely reduced when the termination signals are compromised, an observation which indicates that proper termination coupled with RNA processing can be an important component of a cell's control on the quality of its RNA transcripts. external transcribed spacers polymerase chain reaction polymerase. external transcribed spacers polymerase chain reaction polymerase.

Biol. 1994; 239: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and illustrated by the example analyses inFig. 1, when a yeast rDNA transcriptional unit or a gene encoding the 5 S rRNA is inserted in a high copy shuttle vector and expressed in yeast after cell transformation, an efficient and even preferential expression of plasmid-encoded RNA is observed with 50-90% of the RNA population being derived from plasmid-encoded transcripts. With direct 5 S rRNA quantification (Fig. 1A), the electrophoretic marker shows that 80-90% of the cellular 5 S RNA is mutant (lane b). Similarly, when 3′-end termini are mapped using S1 nuclease digestion (Fig. 1B) and a mutant RNA-specific probe(12Melekhovets Y.F. Good L. Abou Elela S. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the termination sites, processing intermediates, and mature 25 S rRNA are all clearly evident (lane d). In striking contrast, however, when the termination signals are deleted using PCR-mediated targeted mutagenesis(9Lee Y. Erkine A.M. Van Ryk D.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,12Melekhovets Y.F. Good L. Abou Elela S. Nazar R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), almost no plasmid-derived RNA is evident. As shown inFig. 1, steady state analyses of the cellular 5 S RNA population (Fig. 1A) indicate that, without normal termination (lane c), the plasmid-derived transcripts are very unstable with no plasmid-derived RNA being observed after methylene blue staining. Similarly (Fig. 1B), only trace amounts or no plasmid-derived 25 S rRNA or processing intermediates are evident (lane c) when unterminated rDNA transcripts are characterized by S1 nuclease digestion studies. Both results clearly demonstrate a striking instability in nascent transcripts that are not properly terminated, with no mature plasmid-derived RNA being detected. As indicated inFig. 2, the normal 5 S rRNA transcript (a, b) is extended by about 12 nucleotides, terminating in a polyuridylic acid cluster of 4-5 residues(5Rubin G.M. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1975; 6: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,6Jacq B. Jourdan R. Jourdan B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,7Hamada H. Muramatsu M. Urano Y. Onishi T. Kominami R. Cell. 1979; 17: 163-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), this extension being rapidly removed during maturation. As illustrated with two examples inFig. 3, this spacer sequence could be modestly altered, both with respect to the nucleotide sequence and length without an effect on the mature rRNA product. For example, when the spacer was abbreviated to only a poly(U) cluster (lane c), which constitutes the basic termination signal(5Rubin G.M. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1975; 6: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,6Jacq B. Jourdan R. Jourdan B.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,7Hamada H. Muramatsu M. Urano Y. Onishi T. Kominami R. Cell. 1979; 17: 163-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), or modestly lengthened to 24 nucleotides with poly(C) clusters (lane d), the plasmid-derived molecules continued to constitute 80-90% of the cellular 5 S rRNA population. In sharp contrast, however, when the poly(U) cluster was substantially displaced (lane e) with a long spacer (490 base pairs), a mature product was again absent as was observed earlier (Fig. 1) with a deleted termination signal.Figure 3:Effect of 3′ external transcribed sequences on 5 S rRNA stability. Altered 3′-ETS regions in the S. cerevisiae 5 S rRNA gene (Fig. 2) were synthesized by PCR amplification using primers containing the mutant sequence but still complementary to the 3′-end of the normal 5 S rRNA sequence and a plasmid DNA template (pYF5A99) containing a structurally marked (A99) 5 S rRNA gene sequence(8Van Ryk D.I. Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8377-8381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Lee Y. Erkine A.M. Van Ryk D.I. Nazar R.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The mutant genes were again cloned in pYF404, the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the recombinants were used to transform LEU2-deficient S. cerevisiae cells. Whole cell RNA was prepared from exponentially growing transformants (lanes c-g) and fractionated by gel electrophoresis (8Van Ryk D.I. Lee Y. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8377-8381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described inFig. 1. RNA from untransformed cells and cells transformed with pYF5A99 were included in lanes a and b, respectively; the positions of the normal and plasmid-derived 5 S rRNAs are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the spacer sequence appeared not to be directly critical to RNA product stability and ribosomal integration, other features were examined, namely secondary structure and length. As also illustrated inFigure 2:, Figure 3:, both of these proved to be important factors in RNA stability. When the sequence was altered to insert a small (5 base pairs) hairpin structure in the spacer (lane f) only about 50% of the mature RNA was of plasmid origin, and when the spacer was more substantially lengthened to 41 nucleotides (lane g), only about 10% of the mature RNA was of plasmid origin. Taken together, the results shown inFigure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3: indicate that termination followed by efficient processing is essential for transcript stability. Presumably, with inefficient processing or no processing at all, the nascent transcript is not integrated into ribosomal structure and is susceptible to cellular “housekeeping” degradation, which may even be mediated, at least in part, by the processing enzymes. In a number of organisms(13Piper P.W. Bellatin J.A. Lockheart A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 2: 353-359Google Scholar,14Frendewey D. Dingermann T. Cooley L. Soll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 449-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Xing Y.Y. Worcel A. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1008-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), 5 S rRNA processing has been shown to be dependent, at least in part, on exonuclease cleavage, and while the details are less clear, nucleolar RNA processing is also dependent, at least in part, on exonuclease trimming (see (16Nazar R.N. Cell Nucleus. 1982; 11: 1-28Google Scholar)). It appears, therefore, that when the termination site is too distant from the mature RNA or encumbered with secondary structure, processing is sufficiently retarded or eliminated, resulting in transcript degradation without maturation. Indeed, the significance of termination as a factor in quality control is not likely restricted to pol I or III transcripts. Although the termination signal has not been clearly defined with pol II transcripts (17Richardson J.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), mRNA instability often has been linked to changes in the termination region. When many mRNAs are not polyadenylated (see (18Bernstein P. Ross J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 373-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and (19Atwater J.A. Wisdom R. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) for reviews), rapid turnover is frequently reported, and there is evidence that the function of intrinsic terminators is coupled to the functioning of the 3′-end maturation signals(20Connelly S. Manley J.L. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 440-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), indicating that defects which prevent cleavage of the nascent transcript also prevent the functioning of the downstream terminators. A conclusion cannot be drawn until pol II termination is further clarified. In the interim, the observations made here clearly show that, at least for pol I and III transcripts, proper termination appears to help in ensuring that only normal precursors are being assembled into ribosomes. Furthermore, when the present results are taken together with recent reports of relationships between enhancer and terminator sequences in rDNAs (see (21Morrow B.E. Johnson S.P. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)), they may even indicate that correct termination plays a role in coordinate regulation through the same degradation mechanism.

Deleting the NH2-terminal 11 or 28 amino acid residues (ΔN11 or ΔN28) or the COOH-terminal 15 amino acid residues (ΔC15) abolished binding of the ELC to the MHC when the mutants were expressed in wild-type (WT) cells. In contrast, the ELC carrying deletion or insertion of four amino acid residues (D4 or I4) in the central linker segment bound the MHC in WT cells, although less efficient competition with WT ELC suggested that the affinity for the MHC is reduced. When these mutants were expressed in ELC-minus (mlcE-) cells, where the binding to the heavy chain is not dependent on efficient competition with the endogenous ELC, ΔN28 and ΔN11 bound to the MHC at 15% of WT levels and ΔC15 did not bind to a significant degree. I4 and D4, however, bound with normal stoichiometry. These data indicate that residues at both termini of the ELC are required for association with the MHC, while the central linker domain appears to be less critical for binding. When the mutants were analyzed for their ability to complement the cytokinesis defect displayed by mlcE- cells, a correlation to the level of ELC carried by the MHC was observed, indicating that a stoichiometric ELC-MHC association is necessary for normal myosin function in vivo. Dictyostelium myosin deficient in the essential light chain (ELC) does not function normally either in vivo or in vitro (Pollenz, R. S., Chen, T. L., Trivinos-Lagos, L., and Chisholm, R. L.(1992) Cell 69, 951-962). Since normal [Medline] myosin function requires association of ELC, we investigated the domains of ELC that are necessary for binding to the myosin heavy chain (MHC). Deleting the NH2-terminal 11 or 28 amino acid residues (ΔN11 or ΔN28) or the COOH-terminal 15 amino acid residues (ΔC15) abolished binding of the ELC to the MHC when the mutants were expressed in wild-type (WT) cells.

Myosin is a mechanochemical enzyme that generates force during muscle contraction and has a fundamental role in a variety of cell movements (for review, see (2Warrick H.M. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 379-421Google Scholar)). Conventional myosin is a hexameric protein composed of a pair of heavy chains (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHCmyosin heavy chainELCessential light chainRLCregulatory light chainCaMcalmodulinWTwild-typePCRpolymerase chain reactionPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albuminDAPI4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole-2HCl. and two pairs of light chains, called essential light chains (ELC) and regulatory light chains (RLC). Both light chains bind to the neck of myosin(3Winkelmann D.A. Lowey S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 595-612Google Scholar, 4Katoh T. Lowey S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1549-1560Google Scholar). We have shown that ELC-deficient Dictyostelium cell lines are defective in cytokinesis, and myosin purified from these cells does not show significant actin-activated ATPase activity(1Pollenz R.S. Chen T.L. Trivinos-Lagos L. Chisholm R.L. Cell. 1992; 69: 951-962Google Scholar). Since normal myosin function requires association of the ELC, we set out to map the domains of the ELC that are critical for ELC-MHC interaction. myosin heavy chain essential light chain regulatory light chain calmodulin wild-type polymerase chain reaction 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole-2HCl. Sequence comparisons of ELCs from various sources show that the COOH-terminal half of the molecule is more conserved than the NH2-terminal half (5Pariasamy M.R. Wadgaonkar C. Kumar B.J. Martin M.A. Siddiqui Q. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 19: 7723-7734Google Scholar, 6Hailstones D. Gunning P.W. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1990; 10: 1095-1104Google Scholar) and that it may represent the site required for association with MHC. Skeletal muscle alkali light chain A1 in which the COOH-terminal 14 residues were chemically removed did not bind the S1 heavy chain, although the conformation remained largely unchanged(7Ueno H. Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1785-1793Google Scholar). Transfection studies also showed that a COOH-terminal truncation of the alkali light chain A1 failed to colocalize with acto-myosin structures in cultured myocytes (8Soldati T. Perriard J. Cell. 1991; 66: 277-288Google Scholar). The ELC belongs to the calmodulin-troponin gene family, which contains four helix-loop-helix structures, also known as EF-hands (for review, see (9Kretsinger R.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 119-174Google Scholar)). The atomic structures of calmodulin (CaM) and troponin C show two terminal globular lobes linked by a central helix, with each lobe containing a pair of EF-hands(10Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Google Scholar, 11Herzberg O. James M.N.G. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Google Scholar). Although ELCs may no longer bind Ca2+ due to amino acid deletions or substitutions in the Ca2+-coordinating sites(9Kretsinger R.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 8: 119-174Google Scholar), several lines of evidence suggest that the overall structure has been preserved. The ELC has many physical and chemical properties similar to those of CaM and troponin C, including Stokes radius, molecular weight, sedimentation coefficient, and radius of gyration(4Katoh T. Lowey S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1549-1560Google Scholar). Secondary and tertiary structural modeling, based on factors thought to control protein folding, also predicted similar tertiary arrangements for ELC, troponin C, and CaM(12Bechet J. Houadjeto M. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 996: 199-208Google Scholar). Recently, three-dimensional structures of myosin S1 (13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Google Scholar) and the regulatory domain of scallop myosin (14Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar) confirmed these predictions. Based on these structures, we divided the Dictyostelium ELC into three structural domains: an NH2-terminal globular domain, a COOH globular domain, and a central linker domain. The participation of these domains in ELC-MHC interaction was assessed. In vitro mutagenesis was used to modify the Dictyostelium ELC, and the altered ELCs were expressed in both WT and mlcE- cells. The ability of mutant ELC to associate with the MHC in vivo and to rescue the phenotypic defects of mlcE- cells was analyzed. Mutagenesis employed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach. To construct the myc-tagged and terminal-deleted ELCs, the conventional one-template PCR amplification was employed using the Dictyostelium ELC cDNA (15Chisholm R.L. Rushforth A.M. Pollenz R.S. Kuczmarski E.R. Tafuri S.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 86: 209-222Google Scholar, 16Pollenz R.S. Chisholm R.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 20: 83-94Google Scholar) as a template. The primer used to introduce the myc epitope at the end of the ELC coding sequence was designed to match 17 nucleotides before the stop codon, followed by 30 nucleotides encoding the myc epitope and a stop codon. To create terminal deletions, the primers were made to match 17 nucleotides adjacent to the deletions, followed by either a start codon or a stop codon. A BamHI site and two extra bases were included at the 5′ end of all primers to facilitate cloning(17Scharf S.J. Horn G.T. Erlich H.A. Science. 1986; 233: 1076-1078Google Scholar). To construct the I4, D4, and F15A ELCs, the overlap extension PCR technique was used(18Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Google Scholar, 19Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 77: 61-68Google Scholar). A pair of internal primers containing the desired mutations were complementary to each other for at least 17 nucleotides at their 5′ ends. A pair of external primers, the forward and the reverse primers of the plasmid Bluescript pKS (Stratagene), flanked the entire ELC coding sequence since the ELC cDNA was cloned into the polylinker region of the plasmid pKS. The first stage PCR amplifications were performed in two separate reactions, with one internal and one external primers to produce the 5′ and 3′ fragments of the desired final PCR product. These two fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, treated with T4 DNA polymerase to remove overhanging 3′ adenosine residues(20Paabo S. Irwin D.M. Wilson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4718-4721Google Scholar), and used as template for the second stage PCR amplification with external primers to produce a full-length ELC mutant. All PCR products were sequenced. Mutated ELCs were then cloned into the pBORP expression vector at the BamHI site(21Ostrow B.D. Chen P. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1945-1955Google Scholar). AX3 cells or mlcE- cells were transformed by electroporation (22Howard P. Ahern K. Firtel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2613-2627Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and grown in HL-5 medium containing 10 μg/ml G418 and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Dictyostelium whole cell lysates were prepared as described by Pollenz et al.(1Pollenz R.S. Chen T.L. Trivinos-Lagos L. Chisholm R.L. Cell. 1992; 69: 951-962Google Scholar), and cytoskeletons were prepared according to Giffard et al.(23Giffard R.G. Spudich J.A. Spudich A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 115-131Google Scholar). To release myosin from cytoskeletons, cytoskeletal pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 100 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 200 mM KCl, and 2 mM ATP. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation and referred to as ATP-released myosin supernatant. Protein samples were electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with myosin anti-serum NU-48. Antibody binding was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). For quantitation analysis, antibody-binding was detected with 125I-labeled protein A (gift of Dr. J. Bartles) or Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (DuPont NEN). Autoradiographs were scanned using laser densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to determine the relative levels of MHC, WT and mutant ELCs, and RLC. Myosin was purified as described previously (1Pollenz R.S. Chen T.L. Trivinos-Lagos L. Chisholm R.L. Cell. 1992; 69: 951-962Google Scholar) except that the ammonium sulfate precipitation was eliminated, and gel filtration chromatography employed a Superose 6 column (Pharmacia). Actin-activated ATPase was assayed in the 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM ATP, 10 μM actin, and 50 μg/ml myosin. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 5 min and quenched with acid, and the liberated Pi was quantified following organic extraction(24Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Google Scholar, 25King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Google Scholar). In vitro motility assays were performed as described by Uyeda et al.(26Uyeda T.Q.P. Korn S.J. Spudich J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 699-710Google Scholar). Myosin was diluted to 200 μg/ml in buffer AB (25 mM imidazole, pH 7.4, 25 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol), and applied to a flow cell coated with nitrocellulose. After blocking with AB containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (AB/BSA), a solution of rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled F-actin in AB/BSA was introduced. Active movement was initiated at room temperature by introducing AB/BSA containing 1 mM ATP and the oxygen scavenger enzymes. DAPI staining was performed as described previously(1Pollenz R.S. Chen T.L. Trivinos-Lagos L. Chisholm R.L. Cell. 1992; 69: 951-962Google Scholar). Wild-type and mlcE- cells were harvested from plates and lysed in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 55 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors. The Triton-cytoskeletal pellet was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 0.1 volume/g of cells of a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM dithiothreitol. A 0.2-ml aliquot of the suspension was loaded on Sephacryl-500 column (0.5 cm × 60 cm), eluted at 0.5 ml/min with a buffer containing 10 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 600 mM KCl, 0.2 mM ATP, 1 mM dithiothreitol. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected, and the amount of myosin was measured by probing slot-blots with the MHC monoclonal 396 (provided by Dr. G. Gerisch, Max-Planck Institute). The void volume was 4 ml, and myosin eluted at 6 ml. To facilitate the detection of ELC mutants when expressed in WT cells, the ELCs were tagged at the carboxyl termini with a myc epitope (27Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Google Scholar) of 10 amino acid residues (EQKLISEEDL) and expressed in Dictyostelium AX3 cells using an expression vector pBORP (21Ostrow B.D. Chen P. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1945-1955Google Scholar). Lane 1 in Fig. 1 shows the expression of the tagged WT ELC (mycELC). Based on densitometry, the expression level of mycELC was about 10 times that of the endogenous ELC. This mycELC was present in both the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletons (lane 2) and the ATP-released myosin supernatant (lane 3), suggesting its association with the MHC. Myosin purified from the mycELC transformants showed that 98% of the MHC carried mycELC. Similar levels of binding were observed in the ATP-released myosin supernatant (Table 1). Because supernatants of ATP Triton cytoskeletons accurately reflected association of ELC with MHC, quantification of the mutant ELC-MHC association employed the ATP-released myosin supernatants. Myosin carrying 98% mycELC exhibited normal actin-activated ATPase activity (140 nmol/min/mg). Cytokinesis and development of cells expressing mycELC were indistinguishable from wild-type. These results establish that the myc-epitope tag does not affect either the binding of the ELC to the heavy chain or myosin function.TABLE I Open table in a new tab To test the role of the NH2-terminal domain in MHC association, the first 28 amino acid residues of the ELC were removed. The deleted region contained the first helix (A helix) and loop of the ELC (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows that the truncated molecule, ΔN28, was expressed in WT cells (lane 1) but did not appear in the cytoskeletal fraction (lane 2), indicating that the deletion had abolished the ELC-MHC association. A similar deletion, which removed the first 11 amino acid residues corresponding to the A helix of the ELC (Fig. 2) gave the same result (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). In the complementary analysis, an ELC, which lacked the COOH-terminal 15 residues corresponding to the H helix (Fig. 2), was constructed and expressed (Fig. 3, lane 5). ΔC15 also failed to partition in the cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 3, lane 6). These results suggest that residues at both the NH2 and COOH termini of the ELC are necessary for the ELC-MHC association.Figure 3:Expressed terminal deletion mutants do not associate with MHC in WT cells. Transformants from ΔN28, ΔN11, and ΔC15 were analyzed by Western blots as in Fig. 1. Lanes 1, 3, and 5, whole cell lysates; lanes 2, 4, and 6, Triton-insoluble cytoskeletons. Arrowheads point to the mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The involvement of the COOH terminus of the ELC in heavy chain binding is consistent with previous observations(7Ueno H. Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1785-1793Google Scholar, 8Soldati T. Perriard J. Cell. 1991; 66: 277-288Google Scholar), but participation of residues at NH2 terminus of the ELC has not been previously demonstrated. We tested the possibility that the NH2-terminal residues are required for maintaining an overall conformation of the ELC rather than being in a direct association with the heavy chain. Amino acid residue 15, a phenylalanine residue that is conserved among ELCs(28Collins J.H. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1991; 12: 3-25Google Scholar), was replaced by an alanine. This residue corresponds to Phe-19 of CaM, which has five contacts in the CaM•M13 peptide complex(29Ikura M. Glore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that the F15A ELC mutant was expressed to levels comparable with the mycELC (lane 1) and partitioned in the cytoskeletal fractions (lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that it is associated with the MHC. But unlike the mycELC transformants (Fig. 1), the endogenous ELC appeared in the cytoskeletal fractions of the F15A transformants (lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that the F15A ELC had reduced ability to compete with the endogenous ELC for the binding to the MHC. Quantification of MHC-bound ELC showed that 85% of the MHC carried the F15A ELC in WT cells (Table 1). The reduced binding affinity of this substitution mutant supports the idea that residues at the NH2 terminus of ELC associate directly with the heavy chain. While this work was in progress, mlcE- cell lines produced by gene targeting became available. 2Chen, T.-L. L., Kowalczyk, P. A., Ho, G., and Chisholm, R. L., J. Cell Sci., in press. The ELC mutants were expressed in mlcE- cells to assess their binding to MHC in the absence of competing endogenous ELC. While the levels of expression were comparable with those seen in WT cells, ΔN28 and ΔN11 bound to MHC at 15% of WT levels, whereas ΔC15 did not bind to any significant extent. F15A showed binding comparable with WT ELC. Since F15A was at least 10-fold overexpressed, its reduced binding affinity was apparently masked by its overexpression in mlcE- cells. The central linker domain of the ELC, initially identified by sequence alignment with calmodulin and confirmed by the two available crystal structures(13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Google Scholar, 14Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar), extends from residues 70 to 79. To study the role of this region in ELC-MHC association and to determine if the relative distance between the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal globular domains was critical, insertion and deletion mutants of the central linker were produced. The deletion mutant, D4, was constructed by deleting residues Gln, Glu, Gln, and Gln from positions 74-77. The insertion mutant, I4, carried four additional residues with a helix forming potential Lys, Ser, Thr, and Asp (30Putkey J.A. Ono T. Vanberkum M.F.A. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11242-11249Google Scholar) inserted between residues Glu-79 and Met-80. The sites for insertion and deletion were chosen because changes at these locations were predicted by the Garnier method for secondary structure predication (31Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Google Scholar) to have little effect on the conformation of neighboring structures. Theoretically each amino acid residue in an α-helix causes 100° twist and a 1.5-Å rise(32Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1988: 15-42Google Scholar). Insertion or deletion of four residues in the linker domain would cause an increase or decrease of about one helical turn in relative distance of the two terminal lobes, while the relative orientation is approximately maintained. Despite the fact that both I4 and D4 were expressed to a level comparable with that of mycELC in WT cells, they did not compete as efficiently for the MHC binding as the mycELC (Fig. 5). These two mutants bound to MHC at 40% of the mycELC level in WT cells (Table 1), indicating that the ELC carrying deletion or insertion of residues in the central domain bind MHC with reduced affinity. When the I4 and D4 mutants were overexpressed in mlcE- cells, they associated with MHC stoichiometrically, a situation similar to the F15A ELC. To test the importance of the linker domain in myosin enzymatic function, myosin containing I4 and D4 was purified and assayed for ATPase activity and the ability to support movement of actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay. As shown in Table 2, both myosins had WT activities.TABLE II Open table in a new tab To determine the biochemical properties of a “weak binding” mutant, myosin was purified from cells expressing ΔN11. In purified myosin preparations, ΔN11 bound to MHC at 5% of WT levels. Similar to ELC-minus myosin, ΔN11 myosin did not exhibit significant actin-ATPase and failed to move actin filaments in vitro (Table 2). The most prominent phenotype of the mlcE- cells is the formation of large multinucleate cells when cultured in suspension.2 The ELC mutants were analyzed for their ability to rescue the defect in suspension growth. ELC-minus cells carrying the mutants had normal levels of MHC expression and normal stoichiometric association between the RLC and MHC (data not shown). Fig. 6 shows that cells expressing ΔC15 had a phenotype similar to mlcE- cells, with only 13% of the cells mono- or dinucleated. Cells expressing ΔN28 and ΔN11 had intermediate phenotypes with 35-45% of the cells carrying one or two nuclei, while those expressing F15A, I4, and D4 were indistinguishable from the wild-type. The results show a strong correlation between the level of ELC association with the MHC and the ability to perform myosin-dependent function in vivo. It has been reported that myosin lacking the RLCs has a tendency to aggregate(33Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 454-456Google Scholar, 34Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Google Scholar, 35Chen P. Ostrow B.D. Tafuri S.R. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1933-1944Google Scholar), presumably mediated by the exposed, hydrophobic α-helix that serves as binding sites for myosin light chains(13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Google Scholar, 14Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar). An important question is whether the poor cellular myosin function observed with the weak binding mutants ΔN28, ΔN11, ΔC15 is due to a defect in enzymatic activity or aggregation of a significant amount of the myosin lacking bound ELC. To address this question, crude cellular extracts of mlcE- and WT cells were subjected to gel filtration to compare the association state of the myosin. As shown in Fig. 7, the ELC-minus myosin fractionated with the same pattern as wild-type, suggesting there are no gross differences in the physical state of myosin in the two cells. Thus the multinucleate phenotype associated with the weak binding mutants seems unlikely to result from abnormal myosin aggregation. The structure of CaM•M13 peptide complex shows that residues in both lobes of calmodulin are in contact with the M13 peptide (a 26-amino acid peptide containing the CaM binding domain of myosin light chain kinase); residues in the helices account for the vast majority of those contacts(29Ikura M. Glore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Google Scholar, 36Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Google Scholar). By analogy to this structure, the two terminal helices A and H of the Dictyostelium ELC were deleted. The deletions resulted in a loss of ELC binding to the MHC when the mutants were expressed in WT cells. Since the atomic structure of CaM shows independent folding of the two lobes and no interactions between them, it is unlikely that mutations in one lobe affect the folding or tertiary structure of the other. If this is true with ELC, then the deletion results suggest that residues in both the COOH-terminal lobe and NH2-terminal lobe are important for association with the heavy chain. The participation of the NH2 terminus is further supported by the substitution mutant F15A, in which a phenylalanine to alanine substitution resulted in reduced binding of the ELC to the MHC. It is conceivable, therefore, that ELC may bind MHC with both lobes in a manner similar to that of CaM binding its substrates. The recently published atomic structures of myosin S1 (13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Google Scholar) and the regulatory domain of scallop myosin (14Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar) are consistent with this idea. Our results further indicate that neither lobe is sufficient and that both are necessary for the ELC-MHC association. When expressed in mlcE- cells, ΔC15 did not show significant binding to the MHC, whereas ΔN11 and ΔN28 retained low levels of association. It is possible that the COOH terminus of the ELC may contain a major binding site for the heavy chain, and the binding is strengthened by the association with the NH2 terminus. A similar binding mode has been observed for smooth muscle regulatory light chain(37Trybus K.M. Chatman T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4412-4419Google Scholar). Similar to the CaM•M13 peptide complex, the major contacts between ELC and MHC are hydrophobic(13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A.

Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar). Phenylalanine 15, a conserved hydrophobic residue, is shown in this study to take part in the process. There are in total 204 contacts observed between the ELC and MHC(14Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar), implying that many residues of the ELC participate in the ELC-MHC association. A single amino acid substitution, therefore, might not be expected to produce a dramatic effect on binding, as observed for the F15A mutant, which caused a modest reduction in the binding affinity for the heavy chain. The ELC has a dumbbell-like fold similar to that of CaM(13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Google Scholar, 14Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar). Like the bound form of CaM, the helix in the linker region of ELC is unwound to facilitate binding of the two lobes on the heavy chain. It is likely, therefore, that deletion or insertion of residues in the linker region will lead to suboptimal contacts of the terminal domains with respect to the binding site on the heavy chain. This seems likely to provide a structural basis for the reduced binding affinity seen with the I4 and D4 mutations. The D4 mutant, in which only six out of 10 residues in the linker region are retained, still bound the MHC, albeit with a reduced affinity, suggesting that the linker segment must be flexible enough to tolerate significant shortening. In addition, the deletion or insertion of four residues in the linker domain does not seem to affect myosin enzymatic function as assayed by ATPase activity measurements and in vitro motility assays. Similar results were observed in mutagenesis studies of CaM, where it has been proposed that the linker domain functions as a flexible structure to accommodate binding of the two lobes to a range of substrates(31Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Google Scholar, 38Persechini A. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12175-12178Google Scholar, 39Persechini A. Blumenthal D.K. Jarrett H.W. Klee C.B. Hardy D.O. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8052-8058Google Scholar). It is likely that the linker region of ELC may also function primarily as a structural element to place the two globular domains in an optimal contact with the heavy chain. It has been suggested that one function of the myosin light chains is to provide structural support for the region of single α-helix of the heavy chain that exists between the head and the coiled-coil tail domain. One notion is that by stiffening the myosin neck, the light chains contribute to an extension of the effective power stroke resulting from conformational changes in the head(13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Google Scholar, 33Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M.

If this is the case, then the I4 mutant, which extends the central linker domain but apparently has normal myosin function, must still provide adequate structural support. It would be interesting to determine how large a central linker region could become before it would no longer provide sufficient structural support. The light chain binding region of the heavy chain, a long α-helix, is hydrophobic in nature and shielded from solvent by association with light chains(13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Google Scholar, 14Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar). Thus, one apparent function of light chains is the stabilization of this structure. Consistent with this structural analysis, myosins lacking the RLCs have a tendency to aggregate through the neck region(33Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 454-456Google Scholar, 34Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Google Scholar, 35Chen P. Ostrow B.D. Tafuri S.R. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1933-1944Google Scholar). Our results show that the ability of ELC mutants to rescue the cytokinesis defect of mlcE- cells correlates with their ability to bind to heavy chain, establishing that a stoichiometric binding of ELC is necessary in vivo for normal myosin function. On the other hand, the results from mutants F15A, I4, and D4 seem to suggest that as long as the stoichiometric association between ELC and MHC is maintained, myosin would be sufficiently functional to rescue the defects seen in the ELC null mutant. In addition, the similarity of gel filtration profiles of WT and mlcE- cells suggests that the defects observed in mlcE- myosin are unlikely to be due to abnormal aggregation of mlcE- myosin. This raises the question of whether the ELC merely serves a structural support role for the neck of myosin, or might it have other functions? ELC binds to the heavy chain between the active site and the regulatory light chain(13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Google Scholar). It is possible that it may also play a role in modulating myosin enzymatic function and/or in transmitting regulatory signals from the regulatory light chain to the active center. With the atomic structures now in hand, further mutagenesis to explore other functions of ELC are in progress. In summary, we have shown that residues at both termini of the ELC are necessary for the ELC-MHC association. These data provide direct experimental support for the structural models presented recently(13Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäse K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Google Scholar, 14Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar). Residues in the central linker domain do not appear to be essential for either ELC's binding or function, but they do seem to be required for the optimal association of the two terminal domains on the α-helix of heavy chain. Furthermore, a stoichiometric ELC-MHC association is necessary for normal myosin-dependent function in vivo."
