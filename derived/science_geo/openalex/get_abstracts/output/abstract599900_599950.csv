https://openalex.org/W2770186315,"Introduction Acute circulatory dysfunction in patients with sepsis can evolve rapidly into a progressive stage associated with high mortality. Early recognition and adequate resuscitation could improve outcome. However, since the spectrum of clinical presentation is quite variable, signs of hypoperfusion are frequently unrecognized in patients just admitted to the emergency department (ED). Hyperlactatemia is considered a key parameter to disclose tissue hypoxia but it is not universally available and getting timely results can be challenging in low resource settings. In addition, non-hypoxic sources can be involved in hyperlactatemia, and a misinterpretation could lead to over-resuscitation in an unknown number of cases. Capillary refill time (CRT) is a marker of peripheral perfusion that worsens during circulatory failure. An abnormal CRT in septic shock patients after ICU-based resuscitation has been associated with poor outcome. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of abnormal CRT in patients with sepsis-related hyperlactatemia in the early phase after ED admission, and its relationship with outcome. Methods We performed a prospective observational study. Septic patients with hyperlactemia at ED admission subjected to an initial fluid resuscitation (FR) were included. CRT and other parameters were assessed before and after FR. CRT-normal or CRT-abnormal subgroups were defined according to the status of CRT following initial FR, and major outcomes were registered. Results Ninety-five hyperlactatemic septic patients were included. Thirty-one percent had abnormal CRT at ED arrival. After FR, 87 patients exhibited normal CRT, and 8 an abnormal one. Patients with abnormal CRT had an increased risk of adverse outcomes (88% vs. 20% p<0.001; RR 4.4 [2.7–7.4]), and hospital mortality (63% vs. 9% p<0.001; RR 6.7 [2.9–16]) as compared to those with normal CRT after FR. Specifically, CRT-normal patients required less frequently mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and ICU admission, and exhibited a lower hospital mortality. Conclusions Hyperlactatemic sepsis patients with abnormal CRT after initial fluid resuscitation exhibit higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes than patients with normal CRT."

The area of the superficial FAZ was assessed using OCTA. Age, gender, central retinal thickness (CRT), retinal vascular density, refractive error, and axial length were examined to determine associations with FAZ area.The mean age of the subjects was 42.1 ± 20.2 years (range: 10-79 years). The mean FAZ area was 0.32 ± 0.11 mm2, while the mean retinal vascular density was 35.53 ± 0.92%. Multivariate regression analysis was performed using FAZ area as the dependent variable and age, gender, CRT, retinal vascular density, refractive error, and axial length as independent variables. The results of this analysis demonstrate that CRT and retinal vascular density were significantly associated with FAZ area in our sample (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.425). Age, gender, refractive error, and axial length were not significantly correlated with FAZ area, while CRT and retinal vascular density were negatively correlated with FAZ area (CRT: P < 0.001, R2 = 0.356; retinal vascular density: P < 0.001, R2 = 0.189).OCTA results suggest that CRT and retinal vascular density negatively affect FAZ area in healthy eyes."

Here, a genome-wide association study was conducted to parse the complex genetic composition of yield-related traits of 105 elite wheat varieties (lines) using the Wheat 90K Illumina iSelect SNP array. Nine yield-related traits, including maximum number of shoots per square meter (MSN), effective number of spikes per square meter (ESN), percentage of effective spike (PES), number of kernels per spike (KPS), thousand-kernel weight (TKW), the ratio of kernel length/kernel width (RLW), leaf-area index (LAI), plant height (PH), and grain yield (GY), were evaluated across four environments. Twenty four highly significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) (P < 0.001) were identified for nine yield-related traits on chromosomes 1A, 1D, 2A (2), 3B, 4A (2), 4B, 5A (4), 5B (4), 5D, 6B (2), 7A (2), and 7B (3), explaining 10.86–20.27% of the phenotypic variations. Of these, four major loci were identified in more than three environments, including one locus for RLW (6B), one locus for TKW (7A), and two loci for PH (7B). A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker Td99211 for TKW on chromosome 5A was developed and validated in both a natural population composed of 372 wheat varieties (lines) and a RIL population derived from the cross of Yangxiaomai × Zhongyou 9507. The CAPS marker developed can be directly used for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding, and the major MTAs identified can provide useful information for fine-mapping of the target genes in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2769538030,"Background While studies on fertility and contraceptives issues are available, until recently adolescent motherhood has not received enough attention among policy makers in understanding adolescent motherhood in Bangladesh. We aimed to examine the trends and determinants of adolescent motherhood among women aged 15–49 years. Methods For trend analysis we used all the 7 waves of Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS, 1993–2014) data but for multivariate analysis 4 waves of BDHS (2004–2014). Two separate analyses were carried out on ever married women aged 15–49: (1) teenage girls aged 15–19 and (2) adult women aged 20 and above. Results The prevalence of adolescent motherhood had declined to a slower pace from 1993 to2014 (from 33.0% to 30.8%). Lower spousal age gap and higher education were found to be associated with lower likelihood of adolescent motherhood both among teenage girls [OR 0.447 (0.374–0.533)] and adult women [OR 0.451 (0.420–0.484)]. Teenage girls in the poorest wealth quintile [OR 1.712 [1.350–2.173] were more likely to experience adolescent motherhood than the richest wealth quintile. Teenage girls who had no education were found to have 2.76 times higher odds of adolescent motherhood than their counterparts who had higher than secondary education. Concerning the time effect, the odds of adolescent motherhood among adult women was found to decline overtime. Conclusions Despite substantial decrease in total fertility rate in Bangladesh adolescent motherhood is still highly prevalent though declining from 1993 to 2014. Social policies including those addressing poverty, ensuring greater emphasis on education for women; and adolescent mothers in rural areas are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2770848007,"Since its initial application in mammalian cells, CRISPR-Cas9 has rapidly become a preferred method for genome engineering experiments. The Cas9 nuclease is targeted to genomic DNA using guide RNAs (gRNA), either as the native dual RNA system consisting of a DNA-targeting CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), or as a chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA). Entirely DNA-free CRISPR-Cas9 systems using either Cas9 protein or Cas9 mRNA and chemically synthesized gRNAs allow for transient expression of CRISPR-Cas9 components, thereby reducing the potential for off-targeting, which is a significant advantage in therapeutic applications. In addition, the use of synthetic gRNA allows for the incorporation of chemical modifications for enhanced properties including improved stability. Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of chemically modified gRNAs, but have focused on one pattern with multiple modifications in co-electroporation with Cas9 mRNA or multiple modifications and patterns with Cas9 plasmid lipid co-transfections. Here we present gene editing results using a series of chemically modified synthetic sgRNA molecules and chemically modified crRNA:tracrRNA molecules in both electroporation and lipid transfection assessing indel formation and/or phenotypic gene knockout. We show that while modifications are required for co-electroporation with Cas9 mRNA, some modification patterns of the gRNA are toxic to cells compared to the unmodified gRNA and most modification patterns do not significantly improve gene editing efficiency. We also present modification patterns of the gRNA that can modestly improve Cas9 gene editing efficiency when co-transfected with Cas9 mRNA or Cas9 protein (> 1.5-fold difference). These results indicate that for certain applications, including those relevant to primary cells, the incorporation of some, but not all chemical modification patterns on synthetic crRNA:tracrRNA or sgRNA can be beneficial to CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing."
https://openalex.org/W2770741703,"Seafarers have reported impaired health and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Social support might increase HRQOL, but little is known about this association among Chinese seafarers. The aim of this study was to describe social support and explore its association with HRQOL among Chinese seafarers.A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the ports of Nantong and Rugao, China, from April to December 2013. A total of 917 Chinese seafarers were interviewed on social support, mental distress, perceived occupational stress, and HRQOL using the following self-administered questionnaires: The Social Support Rating Scale, Self-rating Depression Scale, Occupational Stress Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire. Hierarchical linear regression modelling was used to analyze the association between seafarers' subjective level of social support and their HRQOL.Of the 917 male Chinese seafarers included in the study, 40.7% perceived high levels of social support, and 39.1% were highly satisfied with their overall quality of life (QOL). Hierarchical regression analysis showed significant associations between level of social support and all health dimensions in the WHOQOL-BREF, even after adjusting for depressive symptoms, occupational stress, occupational activities, sleep duration, and other relevant covariates. Compared with the medium or low level social support group, seafarers with a high level of social support had better QOL scores in the general facet health and QOL (β = 2.43, p<0.05), and the physical health (β = 3.23, p<0.001), psychological health (β = 5.56, p<0.001), social relation (β = 6.07, p<0.001), and environment domains (β = 4.27, p<0.001). In addition, depression, occupational stress, occupational activities, and sleep duration were found to be determinants of seafarers' HRQOL.Chinese seafarers have poorer HRQOL than the general population, but social support has a significant positive effect on their HRQOL. Efforts to improve social support should be undertaken."
https://openalex.org/W2769805651,"Campylobacter is the leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis in the European Union. Birds represent the main reservoir of the bacteria, and human campylobacteriosis mainly occurs after consuming and/or handling poultry meat. Reducing avian intestinal Campylobacter loads should impact the incidence of human diseases. At the primary production level, several measures have been identified to reach this goal, including vaccination of poultry. Despite many studies, however, no efficient vaccine is currently available. We have recently identified new vaccine candidates using the reverse vaccinology strategy. This study assessed the in vivo immune and protective potential of six newly-identified vaccine antigens. Among the candidates tested on Ross broiler chickens, four (YP_001000437.1, YP_001000562.1, YP_999817.1, and YP_999838.1) significantly reduced cecal Campylobacter loads by between 2 and 4.2 log10 CFU/g, with the concomitant development of a specific humoral immune response. In a second trial, cecal load reductions results were not statistically confirmed despite the induction of a strong immune response. These vaccine candidates need to be further investigated since they present promising features."
https://openalex.org/W2768433236,"HLA-E is a non-conventional MHC Class I molecule that has been recently demonstrated to present pathogen-derived ligands, resulting in the TCR-dependent activation of αβ CD8+ T cells. The goal of this study was to characterize the ligandome displayed by HLA-E following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) using an in-depth mass spectrometry approach. Here we identified 28 Mtb ligands derived from 13 different source proteins, including the Esx family of proteins. When tested for activity with CD8+ T cells isolated from sixteen donors, nine of the ligands elicited an IFN-γ response from at least one donor, with fourteen of 16 donors responding to the Rv0634A19-29 peptide. Further evaluation of this immunodominant peptide response confirmed HLA-E restriction and the presence of Rv0634A19-29-reactive CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of human donors. The identification of an Mtb HLA-E ligand that is commonly recognized may provide a target for a non-traditional vaccine strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2769609858,"Our recent study indicated that vitamin D and its receptors are important parts of the amyloid processing pathway in neurons. Yet the role of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in amyloid pathogenesis is complex and all regulations over the production of amyloid beta cannot be explained solely with the transcriptional regulatory properties of VDR. Given that we hypothesized that VDR might exist on the neuronal plasma membrane in close proximity with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and secretase complexes. The present study primarily focused on the localization of VDR in neurons and its interaction with amyloid pathology-related proteins. The localization of VDR on neuronal membranes and its co-localization with target proteins were investigated with cell surface staining followed by immunofluorescence labelling. The FpClass was used for protein-protein interaction prediction. Our results demonstrated the localization of VDR on the neuronal plasma membrane and the co-localization of VDR and APP or ADAM10 or Nicastrin and limited co-localization of VDR and PS1. E-cadherin interaction with APP or the γ-secretase complex may involve NOTCH1, NUMB, or FHL2, according to FpClass. This suggested complex might also include VDR, which greatly contributes to Ca+2 hemostasis with its ligand vitamin D. Consequently, we suggested that VDR might be a member of this complex also with its own non-genomic action and that it can regulate the APP processing pathway in this way in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2770817312,"Australia’s native marsupial fauna has just two primarily flesh-eating ‘hypercarnivores’, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) and the spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus) which coexist only on the island of Tasmania. Devil populations are currently declining due to a fatal transmissible cancer. Our aim was to analyse the diet of both species across their range in Tasmania, as a basis for understanding how devil decline might affect the abundance and distribution of quolls through release from competition. We used faecal analysis to describe diets of one or both species at 13 sites across Tasmania. We compared diet composition and breadth between the two species, and tested for geographic patterns in diets related to rainfall and devil population decline. Dietary items were classified into 6 broad categories: large mammals (≥ 7.0kg), medium-sized mammals (0.5–6.9kg), small mammals (< 0.5kg), birds, reptiles and invertebrates. Diet overlap based on prey-size category was high. Quoll diets were broader than devils at all but one site. Devils consumed more large and medium-sized mammals and quolls more small mammals, reptiles and invertebrates. Medium-sized mammals (mainly Tasmanian pademelon Thylogale billardierii), followed by large mammals (mainly Bennett’s wallaby Macropus rufogriseus) and birds, were the most important prey groups for both species. Diet composition varied across sites, suggesting that both species are flexible and opportunistic foragers, but was not related to rainfall for devils. Quolls included more large mammals but fewer small mammals and invertebrates in their diet in the eastern drier parts of Tasmania where devils have declined. This suggests that a competitive release of quolls may have occurred and the substantial decline of devils has provided more food in the large-mammal category for quolls, perhaps as increased scavenging opportunities. The high diet overlap suggests that if resources become limited in areas of high devil density, interspecific competition could occur."
https://openalex.org/W2770486110,"A respirator fit test panel (RFTP) with facial size distribution representative of intended users is essential to the evaluation of respirator fit for new models of respirators. In this study an anthropometric survey was conducted among youths representing respirator users in mid-Taiwan to characterize head-and-face dimensions key to RFTPs for application to small-to-medium facial features. The participants were fit-tested for three N95 masks of different facepiece design and the results compared to facial size distribution specified in the RFTPs of bivariate and principal component analysis design developed in this study to realize the influence of facial characteristics to respirator fit in relation to facepiece design. Nineteen dimensions were measured for 206 participants. In fit testing the qualitative fit test (QLFT) procedures prescribed by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration were adopted. As the results show, the bizygomatic breadth of the male and female participants were 90.1 and 90.8% of their counterparts reported for the U.S. youths (P < 0.001), respectively. Compared to the bivariate distribution, the PCA design better accommodated variation in facial contours among different respirator user groups or populations, with the RFTPs reported in this study and from literature consistently covering over 92% of the participants. Overall, the facial fit of filtering facepieces increased with increasing facial dimensions. The total percentages of the tests wherein the final maneuver being completed was “Moving head up-and-down”, “Talking” or “Bending over” in bivariate and PCA RFTPs were 13.3–61.9% and 22.9–52.8%, respectively. The respirators with a three-panel flat fold structured in the facepiece provided greater fit, particularly when the users moved heads. When the facial size distribution in a bivariate RFTP did not sufficiently represent petite facial size, the fit testing was inclined to overestimate the general fit, thus for small-to-medium facial dimensions a distinct RFTP should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2768192051,"Background In September 2016, three acutely jaundiced (AJS) pregnant women were admitted to Am Timan Hospital, eastern Chad. We described the outbreak and conducted a case test-negative study to identify risk factors for this genotype of HEV in an acute outbreak setting. Methods Active case finding using a community based surveillance network identified suspected AJS cases. Pregnant or visibly ill AJS cases presenting at hospital were tested with Assure® IgM HEV rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and some with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in Amsterdam; confirmed cases were RDT-positive and controls were RDT-negative. All answered questions around: demographics, household makeup, area of residence, handwashing practices, water collection behaviour and clinical presentation. We calculated unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results Between September and April 2017, 1443 AJS cases (1293 confirmed) were detected in the town(attack rate: 2%; estimated 65,000 population). PCR testing confirmed HEV genotype 1e. HEV RDTs were used for 250 AJS cases; 100 (40%) were confirmed. Risk factors for HEV infection, included: having at least two children under the age of 5 years (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.1–4.3), having another household member with jaundice (OR 2.4, 95%CI 0.90–6.3) and, with borderline significance, living in the neighbourhoods of Riad (OR 3.8, 95%CI 1.0–1.8) or Ridina (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.0–12.6). Cases were more likely to present with vomiting (OR 3.2, 9%CI 1.4–7.9) than controls; possibly due to selection bias. Cases were non-significantly less likely to report always washing hands before meals compared with controls (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.1–1.1). Discussion Our study suggests household factors and area of residence (possibly linked to access to water and sanitation) play a role in HEV transmission; which could inform future outbreak responses. Ongoing sero-prevalence studies will elucidate more aspects of transmission dynamics of this virus with genotype 1e."
https://openalex.org/W2769479254,"HIV-1 and addictive drugs, such as cocaine (COC), may act in combination to produce serious neurological complications. In the present experiments, striatal brain slices from HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) and F344 control female rats were studied. First, we examined dopamine (DA) reuptake in control, HIV-1, COC-treated (5µM) and HIV-1+COC-treated, striatal slices using fast scan cyclic voltammetry. COC-treated striatal slices from F344 control animals significantly increased DA reuptake time (T80), relative to untreated control slices. In contrast, in HIV-1 Tg striatal slices, DA reuptake time was extended by HIV-1, which was not further altered by COC treatment. Second, analysis of medium spiny neuronal populations from striatal brain slices found that controls treated with cocaine displayed increases in spine length, whereas cocaine treated HIV-1 slices displayed decreased spine length. Taken together, the current study provides evidence for dysfunction of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in mediating DA reuptake in HIV-1 Tg rats and limited responses to acute COC exposure. Collectively, dysfunction of the DAT reuptake and altered dendritic spine morphology of the MSNs, suggest a functional disruption of the dopamine system within the HIV-1 Tg rat."
https://openalex.org/W2769252140,"The uplift and final connection of the Central American land bridge is considered the major event that allowed biotic exchange between vertebrate lineages of northern and southern origin in the New World. However, given the complex tectonics that shaped Middle America, there is still substantial controversy over details of this geographical reconnection, and its role in determining biogeographic patterns in the region. Here, we examine the phylogeography of Bothrops asper, a widely distributed pitviper in Middle America and northwestern South America, in an attempt to evaluate how the final Isthmian uplift and other biogeographical boundaries in the region influenced genealogical lineage divergence in this species. We examined sequence data from two mitochondrial genes (MT-CYB and MT-ND4) from 111 specimens of B. asper, representing 70 localities throughout the species' distribution. We reconstructed phylogeographic patterns using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods and estimated divergence time using the Bayesian relaxed clock method. Within the nominal species, an early split led to two divergent lineages of B. asper: one includes five phylogroups distributed in Caribbean Middle America and southwestern Ecuador, and the other comprises five other groups scattered in the Pacific slope of Isthmian Central America and northwestern South America. Our results provide evidence of a complex transition that involves at least two dispersal events into Middle America during the final closure of the Isthmus."
https://openalex.org/W2769571922,"Introduction The current student generation have their own expectations toward professional life and pay particular attention to their work-life balance. Less interest in work-intensive specialties leads to a shortage of skilled candidates especially in surgery. In order to motivate students into a surgical residency, new priorities become important. A deeper understanding of the underlying arguments and students’ expectations towards a surgical training are necessary to counteract a future shortage of specialized surgeons. Methods We conducted an internet-based survey among medical students at two representative German university hospitals to gain more information about the underlying mechanisms that lead to opting for and against a surgical career. We particularly paid attention to gender differences and differences between students of different academic years. Results A total of 1098 students participated in the survey. Sixty-four percent were female. The majority of the students were of the opinion that surgery is an interesting and meaningful profession. In contrast, when it comes to their own career choice, most students (89% female and 81% male) are not willing to choose a surgical specialty. While students are certainly willing to spend a large amount of time on their professional lives, at the same time they demand planning reliability and a sufficient work-life balance. Flexibility in working hours and an existing childcare program were identified as predominant factors for all students and in particular for female students. The same applies to a respectful conversional tone and appreciation of the individual work. Factors like prestige and salary were less relevant than “self-fulfillment” in terms of respectful interaction and balancing their working and private lives. There was significant difference in female and male students as female students have clearer ideas concerning career planning but at the same time are less self-confident than their male colleagues. Moreover, there was a significant difference between junior and senior students regarding career planning with a shift to less work-intensive specialties and especially away from a surgical residency in older students. Adjustments to working hours models, working environment, clinical curriculum and a respectful interaction are factors that might increase the willingness of young students to choose a surgical career."
https://openalex.org/W2769038041,"Background The coexistence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) leads to increased morbidity and mortality. The development of home-based screening tests is essential to expedite diagnosis. Nevertheless, there is still very limited evidence on the effectiveness of portable monitoring to diagnose OSAS in patients with pulmonary comorbidities. Objective To assess the influence of suffering from COPD in the performance of an oximetry-based screening test for moderate-to-severe OSAS, both in the hospital and at home. Methods A total of 407 patients showing moderate-to-high clinical suspicion of OSAS were involved in the study. All subjects underwent (i) supervised portable oximetry simultaneously to in-hospital polysomnography (PSG) and (ii) unsupervised portable oximetry at home. A regression-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to estimate the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from portable oximetry recordings. Two independent validation datasets were analyzed: COPD versus non-COPD. Results The portable oximetry-based MLP ANN reached similar intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) values between the estimated AHI and the actual AHI for the non-COPD and the COPD groups either in the hospital (non-COPD: 0.937, 0.909–0.956 CI95%; COPD: 0.936, 0.899–0.960 CI95%) and at home (non-COPD: 0.731, 0.631–0.808 CI95%; COPD: 0.788, 0.678–0.864 CI95%). Regarding the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), no statistically significant differences (p >0.01) between COPD and non-COPD groups were found in both settings, particularly for severe OSAS (AHI ≥30 events/h): 0.97 (0.92–0.99 CI95%) non-COPD vs. 0.98 (0.92–1.0 CI95%) COPD in the hospital, and 0.87 (0.79–0.92 CI95%) non-COPD vs. 0.86 (0.75–0.93 CI95%) COPD at home. Conclusion The agreement and the diagnostic performance of the estimated AHI from automated analysis of portable oximetry were similar regardless of the presence of COPD both in-lab and at-home. Particularly, portable oximetry could be used as an abbreviated screening test for moderate-to-severe OSAS in patients with COPD."

The physicochemical properties of CGP were evaluated on the basis of polysaccharide content, protein content, color characteristics, FT-IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Antioxidant activities were researched three different free radicals, including DPPH free radicals, ABTS free radicals and reducing power. The results demonstrated that FDCGP, SDCGP and REDCGP have different physicochemical properties and antioxidant activities. Contrasted with FDCGP and REDCGP, SDCGP exhibited stronger antioxidant abilities. Therefore, considering the polysaccharides appearances and antioxidant activities, the spray drying method is a decent selection for the preparation of such polysaccharides, and it should be selected for application in the food industry."
https://openalex.org/W2770177370,"Culicoides sonorensis biting midges are confirmed vectors of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), which causes mortality in white-tailed deer and ruminant populations. Currently, of the seven EHDV serotypes, only 1, 2, and 6 are detected in the USA, and very few studies have focused on the infection time course of these serotypes within the midge. The objective of this current research was to characterize EHDV-2 infection within the midge by measuring infection prevalence, virus dissemination, and viral load over the course of infection. Midges were fed a blood meal containing 106.9 PFU/ml EHDV-2, collected every 12 h from 0–2 days post feeding (dpf) and daily from 3–10 dpf, and cohorts of 20 C. sonorensis were processed using techniques that assessed EHDV infection and dissemination. Cytopathic effect assays and quantitative (q)PCR were used to determine infection prevalence, revealing a 50% infection rate by 10 dpf using both methods. Using immunohistochemistry, EHDV-2 infection was detectable at 5 dpf, and shown to disseminate from the midgut to other tissues, including fat body, eyes, and salivary glands by 5 dpf. Stain intensity increased from 5–8 dpf, indicating replication of EHDV-2 in secondary infection sites after dissemination. This finding is also supported by trends in viral load over time as determined by plaque assays and qPCR. An increase in titer between 4–5 dpf correlated with viral replication in the midgut as seen with staining at day 5, while the subsequent gradual increase in viral load from 8–10 dpf suggested viral replication in midges with disseminated infection. Overall, the data presented herein suggest that EHDV-2 disseminates via the hemolymph to secondary infection sites throughout the midge and demonstrate a high potential for transmission at five days at 25°C after an infective blood-meal."
https://openalex.org/W2771019156,"The iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is efficient and accurate for rigid registration but it needs the good initial parameters. It is easily failed when the rotation angle between two point sets is large. To deal with this problem, a new objective function is proposed by introducing a rotation invariant feature based on the Euclidean distance between each point and a global reference point, where the global reference point is a rotation invariant. After that, this optimization problem is solved by a variant of ICP algorithm, which is an iterative method. Firstly, the accurate correspondence is established by using the weighted rotation invariant feature distance and position distance together. Secondly, the rigid transformation is solved by the singular value decomposition method. Thirdly, the weight is adjusted to control the relative contribution of the positions and features. Finally this new algorithm accomplishes the registration by a coarse-to-fine way whatever the initial rotation angle is, which is demonstrated to converge monotonically. The experimental results validate that the proposed algorithm is more accurate and robust compared with the original ICP algorithm."

In this study, we evaluated preparation methods for mouse gut with the goal of preserving micron-scale spatial structure while performing fluorescence imaging assays. Our evaluation of embedding methods showed that commonly used media such as Tissue-Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound, paraffin, and polyester waxes resulted in redistribution of luminal contents. By contrast, a hydrophilic methacrylate resin, Technovit H8100, preserved three-dimensional organization. Our mouse intestinal preparation protocol optimized using the Technovit H8100 embedding method was compatible with microbial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and other labeling techniques, including immunostaining and staining with both wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Mucus could be visualized whether the sample was fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) or with Carnoy’s fixative.

Our results indicated that these O. nasutus populations exhibited high levels of genetic structure. Six major mtDNA clades were found, structuring these biomes into distinct groups. Estimates of their divergence times was indicated to be 0.571 myr. The high degree of genetic structure is reflected in the analyses of geometric morphometric; skull differences between lineages in the two ecoregions were detected. During the last glacial maximum, there was a strong increase in suitable abiotic conditions for O. nasutus. Distinct molecular markers revealed a population expansion over time, with a possible demographic retraction during the post-glacial period. Considering that all clades coalesce with the last interglacial maximum, our results indicated that reduction in suitable conditions during this period may have resulted in a possible vicariance associated with refuge isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2769468680,"The risk factors for preeclampsia, extremes of maternal age, changing paternity, concomitant maternal autoimmunity, and/or birth intervals greater than 5 years, suggest an underlying immunopathology. We used peripheral blood and lymphocytes from the UteroPlacental Interface (UPI) of 3rd trimester healthy pregnant women in multicolor flow cytometry—and in vitro suppression assays. The major end-point was the characterization of activation markers, and potential effector functions of different CD4—and CD8 subsets as well as T regulatory cells (Treg). We observed a significant shift of peripheral CD4 –and CD8- T cells from naïve to memory phenotype in preeclamptic women compared to healthy pregnant women consistent with long-standing immune activation. While the proportions of the highly suppressive Cytokine and Activated Treg were increased in preeclampsia, Treg tolerance toward fetal antigens was dysfunctional. Thus, our observations indicate a long-standing inflammatory derangement driving immune activation in preeclampsia; in how far the Treg dysfunction is caused by/causes this immune activation in preeclampsia will be the object of future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2770046668,"Alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation are key drivers of alcohol-induced liver injury, mainly caused by oxidative stress. The roots bark of Ulmus davidiana var. japonica is well known for its substantial antioxidative and antitumorigenic potency. In this study, we examined whether this plant can ameliorate alcohol-induced liver injuries characterized by hepatic steatosis and inflammation through its antioxidative activity. C57BL/6J mice were treated with the root bark extract of Ulmus davidiana var. japonica (RUE; 100 mg of extract/kg bodyweight; oral gavage) and alcohol (1 g/kg of bodyweight; oral gavage) for 5 days. Markers of acute alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis were determined and putative molecular mechanisms responsible for the protection of RUE were investigated. RUE noticeably protected against alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), over-produced by alcohol, negatively orchestrated various signaling pathways involved in the lipid metabolism and inflammation. These pathways were restored through the ROS scavenging activity of RUE in the liver. In particular, the expression of lipogenic genes (e.g., SREBP-1, ACC, and FAS) and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, and NF-κB p65) significantly decreased with RUE treatment. Conversely, the expression of fatty acid oxidation-related genes (e.g., SIRT1, AMPKα, and PGC1α) were increased in mice treated with RUE. Thus, the results indicate that RUE counteracts and thus attenuates alcoholic hepatic steatosis onset in mice, possibly by suppressing ROS-mediated steatosis and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2769039258,"The responses of macroalgae to ocean acidification could be altered by availability of macronutrients, such as ammonium (NH4+). This study determined how the opportunistic macroalga, Ulva australis responded to simultaneous changes in decreasing pH and NH4+ enrichment. This was investigated in a week-long growth experiment across a range of predicted future pHs with ambient and enriched NH4+ treatments followed by measurements of relative growth rates (RGR), NH4+ uptake rates and pools, total chlorophyll, and tissue carbon and nitrogen content. Rapid light curves (RLCs) were used to measure the maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax) and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (Fv/Fm). Photosynthetic capacity was derived from the RLCs and included the efficiency of light harvesting (α), slope of photoinhibition (β), and the light saturation point (Ek). The results showed that NH4+ enrichment did not modify the effects of pH on RGRs, NH4+ uptake rates and pools, total chlorophyll, rETRmax, α, β, Fv/Fm, tissue C and N, and the C:N ratio. However, Ek was differentially affected by pH under different NH4+ treatments. Ek increased with decreasing pH in the ambient NH4+ treatment, but not in the enriched NH4+ treatment. NH4+ enrichment increased RGRs, NH4+ pools, total chlorophyll, rETRmax, α, β, Fv/Fm, and tissue N, and decreased NH4+ uptake rates and the C:N ratio. Decreased pH increased total chlorophyll content, rETRmax, Fv/Fm, and tissue N content, and decreased the C:N ratio. Therefore, the results indicate that U. australis growth is increased with NH4+ enrichment and not with decreasing pH. While decreasing pH influenced the carbon and nitrogen metabolisms of U. australis, it did not result in changes in growth."

The risk ratios for each of the outcome measures were as follows: firearm crimes 1.03 (1.03-1.04), assault crimes 1.03 (1.02-1.03), robbery crimes 1.03 (1.02-1.04), homicide 1.03 (1.01, 1.04), and rape 1.01 (0.99-1.03).Extending prior research in St. Louis, results suggest that aggregated lead exposure at the census tract level predicted crime outcomes, even after accounting for important sociological variables. Moving forward, a more developed understanding of aggregate level crime may necessitate a shift toward studying the synergy between sociological and biological risk factors such as lead exposure."

The enhanced virus replication was tested for 12 viruses and ranged from 2-fold to >1000-fold. There were variations in virus-specific replication (strain differences) across the cell lines examined. Some host genes (CNTD2, COQ9, GCGR, NDUFA9, NEU2, PYCR1, SEC16G, SVOPL, ZFYVE9, and ZNF205) showed that KD resulted in enhanced virus replication. These findings advance platform-enabling vaccine technology, the creation of diagnostic cells substrates, and are informative about the host mechanisms that affect virus replication in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2768687678,"A novel plastic scintillator is developed for the application in the digital positron emission tomography (PET). The novelty of the concept lies in application of the 2-(4-styrylphenyl)benzoxazole as a wavelength shifter. The substance has not been used as scintillator dopant before. A dopant shifts the scintillation spectrum towards longer wavelengths making it more suitable for applications in scintillators of long strips geometry and light detection with digital silicon photomultipliers. These features open perspectives for the construction of the cost-effective and MRI-compatible PET scanner with the large field of view. In this article we present the synthesis method and characterize performance of the elaborated scintillator by determining its light emission spectrum, light emission efficiency, rising and decay time of the scintillation pulses and resulting timing resolution when applied in the positron emission tomography. The optimal concentration of the novel wavelength shifter was established by maximizing the light output and it was found to be 0.05 ‰ for cuboidal scintillator with dimensions of 14 mm x 14 mm x 20 mm."
https://openalex.org/W2770919271,"Omega-3 fatty acids are products of secondary metabolism, essential for growth and important for human health. Although there are numerous reports of bacterial production of omega-3 fatty acids, less information is available on the biotechnological production of these compounds from bacteria. The production of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5ω3) by a new species of marine bacteria Shewanella electrodiphila MAR441T was investigated under different fermentation conditions. This strain produced a high percentage (up to 26%) of total fatty acids and high yields (mg / g of biomass) of EPA at or below the optimal growth temperature. At higher growth temperatures these values decreased greatly. The amount of EPA produced was affected by the carbon source, which also influenced fatty acid composition. This strain required Na+ for growth and EPA synthesis and cells harvested at late exponential or early stationary phase had a higher EPA content. Both the highest amounts (20 mg g-1) and highest percent EPA content (18%) occurred with growth on L-proline and (NH4)2SO4. The addition of cerulenin further enhanced EPA production to 30 mg g-1. Chemical mutagenesis using NTG allowed the isolation of mutants with improved levels of EPA content (from 9.7 to 15.8 mg g-1) when grown at 15°C. Thus, the yields of EPA could be substantially enhanced without the need for recombinant DNA technology, often a commercial requirement for food supplement manufacture."
https://openalex.org/W2770949781,"Previous research indicates that body image disturbance is transmitted from mother to daughter via modeling of maternal body-related behaviors and attitudes (indirect transmission) and via maternal body-related feedback (direct transmission). So far, the transmission of body-related attentional biases, which according to cognitive-behavioral theories play a prominent role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders, has not been analyzed. The current eye-tracking study applied the concepts of direct and indirect transmission to body-related attentional biases by examining body-related viewing patterns on self- and other-pictures within mother-daughter dyads.Eye movements of N = 82 participants (n = 41 healthy female adolescents, mean age 15.82 years, SD = 1.80, and their mothers, mean age 47.78 years, SD = 4.52) were recorded while looking at whole-body pictures of themselves and a control peer. Based on fixations on self-defined attractive and unattractive body areas, visual attention bias scores were calculated for mothers and daughters, representing the pattern of body-related attention allocation. Based on mothers' fixations on their own daughter's and the adolescent peer's body, a second visual attention bias score was calculated, reflecting the mothers' viewing pattern on their own daughter.Analysis of variance revealed an attentional bias for self-defined unattractive body areas in adolescents. The girls' visual attention bias score correlated significantly with their mothers' bias score, indicating indirect transmission, and with their mothers' second bias score, indicating direct transmission. Moreover, the girls' bias score correlated significantly with negative body-related feedback from their mothers.Female adolescents show a deficit-oriented attentional bias for one's own and a peer's body. The correlated body-related attention patterns imply that attentional biases might be transmitted directly and indirectly from mothers to daughters. Results underline the potential relevance of maternal influences for the development of body image disturbance in girls and suggest specific family-based approaches for the prevention and treatment of eating disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2768273759,"The ability to discover regulatory sequences that control bone-related genes during development has been greatly improved by massively parallel sequencing methodologies. To expand our understanding of cis-regulatory regions critical to the control of gene expression during osteoblastogenesis, we probed the presence of open chromatin states across the osteoblast genome using global DNase hypersensitivity (DHS) mapping. Our profiling of MC3T3 mouse pre-osteoblasts during differentiation has identified more than 224,000 unique DHS sites. Approximately 65% of these sites are dynamic during temporal stages of osteoblastogenesis, and a majority of them are located within non-promoter (intergenic and intronic) regions. Nearly half of all DHS sites (both constitutive and dynamic) overlap binding events of the bone-essential RUNX2 and/or the chromatin-related CTCF transcription factors. This finding reinforces the role of these regulatory proteins as essential components of the bone gene regulome. We observe a reduction in chromatin accessibility throughout the genome between pre-osteoblast and early osteoblasts. Our analysis also defined a class of differentially expressed genes that harbor DHS peaks centered within 1 kb downstream of transcriptional end sites (TES). These DHSs at the 3'-flanks of genes exhibit dynamic changes during differentiation that may impact regulation of the osteoblast genome. Taken together, the distribution of DHS regions within non-promoter locations harboring osteoblast and chromatin related transcription factor binding motifs, reflect novel cis-regulatory requirements to support temporal gene expression in differentiating osteoblasts."

Objective To examine whether timing and diversity of allergenic food introduction are associated with allergic sensitization, allergy and eczema in children until age 10 years. Materials and methods This study among 5,202 children was performed in a population-based prospective cohort. Timing (age ≤6 months vs. >6 months) and diversity (0, 1, 2 and ≥3 foods) of allergenic food (cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut, tree nuts, soy and gluten) introduction were assessed by questionnaires at ages 6 and 12 months. At age 10 years, inhalant and food allergic sensitization were measured by skin prick tests, and physician-diagnosed inhalant and food allergy by questionnaire. Data on parental-reported physician-diagnosed eczema were obtained from birth until age 10 years. Results Children introduced to gluten at age ≤6 months had a decreased risk of eczema (aOR (95% CI): 0.84 (0.72, 0.99)), compared with children introduced to gluten at age >6 months. However, timing of allergenic food introduction was not associated with allergic sensitization or physician-diagnosed allergy. Children introduced to ≥3 allergenic foods at age ≤6 months had a decreased risk of physician-diagnosed inhalant allergy (0.64 (0.42, 0.98)), compared with children not introduced to any allergenic food at age ≤6 months. However, diversity of allergenic food introduction was not associated with allergic sensitization, physician-diagnosed food allergy or eczema. Conclusion Neither timing nor diversity of allergenic food introduction was consistently associated with childhood allergic sensitization, allergy or eczema."
https://openalex.org/W2769774984,"The atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2 promotes resolution of acute inflammation by operating as a scavenger receptor for inflammatory CC chemokines in several experimental models of inflammatory disorders, however its role in the brain remains unclear. Based on our previous reports of increased expression of inflammatory chemokines and their corresponding receptors following traumatic brain injury (TBI), we hypothesised that ACKR2 modulates neuroinflammation following brain trauma and that its deletion exacerbates cellular inflammation and chemokine production. We demonstrate increased CCL2 and ACKR2 mRNA expression in post-mortem human brain, whereby ACKR2 mRNA levels correlated with later times post-TBI. This data is consistent with the transient upregulation of ACKR2 observed in mouse brain after closed head injury (CHI). As compared to WT animals, ACKR2-/- mice showed a higher mortality rate after CHI, while the neurological outcome in surviving mice was similar. At day 1 post-injury, ACKR2-/- mice displayed aggravated lesion volume and no differences in CCL2 expression and macrophage recruitment relative to WT mice. Reciprocal regulation of ACKR2 and CCL2 expression was explored in cultured astrocytes, which are recognized as the major source of CCL2 and also express ACKR2. ACKR2 mRNA increased as early as 2 hours after an inflammatory challenge in WT astrocytes. As expected, CCL2 expression also dramatically increased at 4 hours in WT astrocytes but was significantly lower in ACKR2-/- astrocytes, possibly indicating a co-regulation of CCL2 and ACKR2 in these cells. Conversely, in vivo, CCL2 mRNA/protein levels were increased similarly in ACKR2-/- and WT brains at 4 and 12 hours after CHI, in line with the lack of differences in cerebral macrophage recruitment and neurological recovery. In conclusion, ACKR2 is induced after TBI and has a significant impact on mortality and lesion development acutely following CHI, while its role in chemokine expression, macrophage activation, brain pathology, and neurological recovery at later time-points is minor. Concordant to evidence in multiple sclerosis experimental models, our data corroborate a distinct role for ACKR2 in cerebral inflammatory processes compared to its reported functions in peripheral tissues."

However, the health professionals' and patients' use of metered dose inhaler is poor.This study was aimed to explore community pharmacy professionals' (pharmacists' and druggists') competency on metered dose inhaler (MDI) technique.A cross sectional study was employed on pharmacy professionals working in community drug retail outlets in Gondar town, northwest Ethiopia from March to May 2017. Evaluation tool was originally taken and adapted from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Programmes of America (NAEPP) step criteria for the demonstration of a metered dose inhaler to score the knowledge/proficiency of using the inhaler.Among 70 community pharmacy professionals approached, 62 (32 pharmacists and 30 druggists/Pharmacy technicians) completed the survey with a response rate of 85.6%. Only three (4.8%) respondents were competent by demonstrating the vital steps correctly. Overall, only 13 participants got score seven or above, but most of them had missed the essential steps which included steps 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 or 8. There was a significant difference (P = 0.015) in competency of demonstrating adequate inhalational technique among respondents who took training on basic inhalational techniques and who did not.This study shown that, community pharmacy professionals' competency of MDI technique was very poor. So as to better incorporate community pharmacies into future asthma illness management and optimize the contribution of pharmacists, interventions would emphasis to improve the total competence of community pharmacy professionals through establishing and providing regular educational programs."
https://openalex.org/W2768894054,"The West Coast of the United States experienced variable and sometimes highly unusual oceanographic conditions between 2012 and 2015. In particular, a warm mass of surface water known as the Pacific Warm Anomaly (popularly as “The Blob”) impinged on southern California in 2014, and warm-water conditions remained during the 2015 El Niño. We examine how this oceanographic variability affected delivery and individual characteristics of larval spotted sand bass (Paralabrax maculatofasciatus) to an estuarine nursery habitat in southern California. To quantify P. maculatofasciatus settlement patterns, three larval collectors were installed near the mouth of Mission Bay, San Diego CA, and retrieved weekly from June–October of 2012–2015. During ‘Blob‘ conditions in 2014 and 2015, lower settlement rates of spotted sand bass were associated with higher sea surface temperature and lower wind speed, chlorophyll a (chl a) and upwelling. Overall, the number of settlers per day peaked at intermediate chl a values across weeks. Individual characteristics of larvae that settled in 2014–2015 were consistent with a poor feeding environment. Although settlers were longer in length in 2014–15, fish in these years had slower larval otolith growth, a longer larval duration, and a trend towards lower condition, traits that are often associated with lower survival and recruitment. This study suggests that future settlement and recruitment of P. maculatofasciatus and other fishes with similar life histories may be adversely affected in southern California if ocean temperatures continue to rise in the face of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2768429972,"Organic matter (OM) production and degradation is important in coastal estuaries, and OM fate is strongly influenced by the coupled interactions of bioturbation and biogeochemistry. From April to September 2013 sediment cores and a benthic observing system, Wormcam, were used to investigate the in situ relationship of biogeochemistry and macrofauna bioturbation in Cape Lookout Bight North Carolina. Wormcam imagery provided a vivid depiction of macrofauna functioning in an environment not previously observed, and affirmed the importance of fine-scale temporal observations of the benthic environment in situ. Observation of macrofauna presence and bioturbation during the summer contradicted previous studies that found this area to be azoic during methane activity and sulfide build-up. Sulfate concentrations decreased while sulfide and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations increased during the summer. This coincided with changes in the depth and rates of bioturbation. Summer burrow depths (~0.8 cm) and rates (~0.4 cm h-1) were significantly less than spring burrow depths (~3.0 cm) and rates (~1.0 cm h-1). While sulfate reduction and OM degradation increased with temperature at a microscopic level, macroscopic OM degradation was reduced. As a result, reduced conditions dominated and a thin aerobic sediment layer, a few millimeters in thickness, was visible at the sediment surface. Decreases in macrofauna burrow depth and rates diminishes the area of influence of bioturbators, limiting bioturbation and subsequently the important ecosystem functions these organisms provide."
https://openalex.org/W2769558050,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, core promoters of class II genes contain a TATA element, either a TATA box (TATA[A/T]A[A/T][A/G]) or TATA-like element (1 or 2 bp mismatched version of the TATA box). The TATA element directs the assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC) to ensure accurate transcriptional initiation. It has been proposed the PIC is assembled by two distinct pathways in which TBP is delivered by TFIID or SAGA, leading to the widely accepted model that these complexes mediate transcription mainly from TATA-like element- or TATA box-containing promoters, respectively. Although both complexes are involved in transcription of nearly all class II genes, it remains unclear how efficiently SAGA mediates transcription from TATA-like element-containing promoters independently of TFIID. We found that transcription from the TATA box-containing AGP1 promoter was greatly stimulated in a Spt3p-dependent manner after inactivation of Taf1p/TFIID. Thus, this promoter provides a novel experimental system in which to evaluate SAGA-mediated transcription from TATA-like element(s). We quantitatively measured transcription from various TATA-like elements in the Taf1p-dependent CYC1 promoter and Taf1p-independent AGP1 promoter. The results revealed that SAGA could mediate transcription from at least some TATA-like elements independently of Taf1p/TFIID, and that Taf1p-dependence or -independence is highly robust with respect to variation of the TATA sequence. Furthermore, chimeric promoter mapping revealed that Taf1p-dependence or independence was conferred by the upstream activating sequence (UAS), whereas Spt3p-dependent transcriptional stimulation after inactivation of Taf1p/TFIID was specific to the AGP1 promoter and dependent on core promoter regions other than the TATA box. These results suggest that TFIID and/or SAGA are regulated in two steps: the UAS first specifies TFIID or SAGA as the predominant factor on a given promoter, and then the core promoter structure guides the pertinent factor to conduct transcription in an appropriate manner."
https://openalex.org/W2770706836,"Bone marrow cells (BMC) migrate to the injured liver after transplantation, contributing to regeneration through multiple pathways, but mechanisms involved are unclear. This work aimed to study BMC migration, characterize cytokine profile, cell populations and proliferation in mice with liver fibrosis transplanted with GFP+ BMC. Confocal microscopy analysis showed GFP+ BMC near regions expressing HGF and SDF-1 in the fibrotic liver. Impaired liver cell proliferation in fibrotic groups was restored after BMC transplantation. Regarding total cell populations, there was a significant reduction in CD68+ cells and increased Ly6G+ cells in transplanted fibrotic group. BMC contributed to the total populations of CD144, CD11b and Ly6G cells in the fibrotic liver, related to an increment of anti-fibrotic cytokines (IL-10, IL-13, IFN-γ and HGF) and reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A and IL-6). Therefore, HGF and SDF-1 may represent important chemoattractants for transplanted BMC in the injured liver, where these cells can give rise to populations of extrahepatic macrophages, neutrophils and endothelial progenitor cells that can interact synergistically with other liver cells towards the modulation of an anti-fibrotic cytokine profile promoting the onset of liver regeneration."

The purpose of this study was to identify the individual and community factors contributing to the disproportionately high prevalence of anemia among women in this region.A cross-sectional study of 118 women (15-49 years) was performed in a rural colonia (small settlement) in Baja California, Mexico in 2012. Participants completed a survey comprised of demographic, socioeconomic, health, and dietary questions and provided a capillary blood sample. A portable HemoCue was used to measure hemoglobin and diagnose anemia. Anemic participants provided a venous blood sample for laboratory testing to elucidate the etiology of anemia. Anemic participants received vitamin supplements and nutritional counseling. Assessments of six local tiendas (community grocery stores) were performed to ascertain the types of food available for purchase within the community.Prevalence of anemia was 22% among women; laboratory tests revealed iron deficiency was the primary etiology in 80.8% of anemia cases. Other causes of anemia in women included vitamin B-12 deficiency (11.5%) and combined iron and vitamin B-12 deficiency (7.7%). Women from low SES households and women enrolled in the government assistance program Prospera were significantly more likely to be anemic (OR = 3.48, 95% CI 1.35-8.98 and OR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.02-6.09, respectively). Vitamin supplementation was significantly more common among non-anemic women (OR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.94). Dietary assessments showed limited consumption of iron absorption enhancing foods such as fruits and vegetables. Assessments of local tiendas revealed at least one type of meat and citrus fruit available for purchase at each store; however, leafy green vegetables were only available for purchase at one store.All cases of anemia were due to nutritional deficiencies. While vitamin supplementation is a temporary solution, improved individual nutrition knowledge and community access to iron absorption enhancing foods, particularly produce, is needed. Promoting government assistance programs like Prospera and implementing additional programs designed to improve nutrition and health literacy, in conjunction with ensuring access to nutritious foods, might reduce the high prevalence nutritional anemia within the community."

https://openalex.org/W2768228587,"Differences in population density between species of varying size are frequently attributed to metabolic rates which are assumed to scale with body size with a slope of 0.75. This assumption is often criticised on the grounds that 0.75 scaling of metabolic rate with body size is not universal and can vary significantly depending on species and life-history. However, few studies have investigated how interspecific variation in metabolic scaling relationships affects population density in different sized species. Here we predict inter-specific differences in metabolism from niche requirements, thereby allowing metabolic predictions of species distribution and abundance at fine spatial scales. Due to the differences in energetic efficiency required along harsh-benign gradients, an extremophile fish (brown mudfish, Neochanna apoda) living in harsh environments had slower metabolism, and thus higher population densities, compared to a fish species (banded kōkopu, Galaxias fasciatus) in physiologically more benign habitats. Interspecific differences in the intercepts for the relationship between body and density disappeared when species mass-specific metabolic rates, rather than body sizes, were used to predict density, implying population energy use was equivalent between mudfish and kōkopu. Nevertheless, despite significant interspecific differences in the slope of the metabolic scaling relationships, mudfish and kōkopu had a common slope for the relationship between body size and population density. These results support underlying logic of energetic equivalence between different size species implicit in metabolic theory. However, the precise slope of metabolic scaling relationships, which is the subject of much debate, may not be a reliable indicator of population density as expected under metabolic theory."

Methods Data from the China Family Panel Studies, a nationally representative survey, was used for the analysis. Sibling rank was defined as the birth order of all children with the same biological mother. A total of 1116 children ≤ 5 years of age were divided into four groups: children without siblings, first-born children, second-born children, and third-born or younger children. For each child, the body mass index and standard deviation (BMI z score) was calculated according to WHO standards; children with BMI z scores > 2 were classified as obese or overweight (ObOw). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between sibling rank and ObOw status, and the possible influence of gender and ObOw status among other siblings. Results The second and third-born or younger children had a significantly higher risk of becoming ObOw than children without siblings (odds ratio [OR]: 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–1.63 and OR:1.38, 95% CI: 1.17–1.63, respectively). Specifically, female second-born children and male third-born or younger children had a significantly higher risk of ObOw (OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.11–2.01 and OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.07–2.32, respectively). Having an ObOw sibling increased the probability of being ObOw and the magnitude of the effect was larger if siblings were younger. Conclusions Sibling rank was shown to be associated with ObOw status among children 0–5 years of age in rural China. Our findings can help healthcare practitioners and authorities to identify children at risk of obesity. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms of this association."

A number of genetic risk factors and environment factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ADHD. Genes encoding for subtypes of voltage-dependent K channels (Kv) and accessory proteins to these channels have been identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of ADHD. We conducted a two-stage case–control study to investigate the associations between five key genes (KChIP4, KChIP1, DPP10, FHIT, and KCNC1) and the risk of developing ADHD. In the discovery stage comprising 256 cases and 372 controls, KChIP1 rs1541665 and FHIT rs3772475 were identified; they were further genotyped in the validation stage containing 328cases and 431 controls.KChIP1 rs1541665 showed significant association with a risk of ADHD at both stages, with CC vs TT odds ratio (OR) = 1.961, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.366–2.497, in combined analyses (P-FDR = 0.007). Moreover, we also found rs1541665 involvement in ADHD-I subtype (OR (95% CI) = 2.341(1.713, 3.282), and Hyperactive index score (P = 0.005) in combined samples.Intriguingly, gene-environmental interactions analysis consistently revealed the potential interactionsof rs1541665 collaboratingwith maternal stress pregnancy (Pmul = 0.021) and blood lead (Padd = 0.017) to modify ADHD risk. In conclusion, the current study provides evidence that genetic variants of Kv accessory proteins may contribute to the susceptibility of ADHD.Further studies with different ethnicitiesare warranted to produce definitive conclusions."

Three aspects of the framework are mainly described: (i) the rationality of non-structural road network vulnerability, (ii) the metrics for negative consequences accounting for variant road conditions, and (iii) the introduction of a new vulnerability index based on user exposure. Based on the proposed methodology, a case study in the Sioux Falls network which was usually threatened by regular heavy snow during wintertime is detailedly discussed. The vulnerability ranking of links of Sioux Falls network with respect to heavy snow scenario is identified. As a result of non-structural consequences accompanied by conceivable degeneration of network, there are significant increases in generalized travel time costs which are measurements for ""emotionally hurt"" of topological road network."
https://openalex.org/W2768422261,"Folate (vitamin B9) is an essential nutrient required for cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and therefore embryogenesis. Folate deficiency has been associated with many diseases, including congenital heart diseases and megaloblastic anemia, yet the mechanisms underlying these remains elusive. Here, we examine the impact of folate deficiency on the development of the circulation system using a zebrafish transgenic line which displays inducible folate deficiency. Impaired hematopoiesis includes decreased hemoglobin levels, decreased erythrocyte number, increased erythrocyte size and aberrant c-myb expression pattern were observed in folate deficient embryos. Cardiac defects, including smaller chamber size, aberrant cardiac function and cmlc2 expression pattern, were also apparent in folate deficient embryos. Characterization of intracellular folate content in folate deficiency revealed a differential fluctuation among the different folate derivatives that carry a single carbon group at different oxidation levels. Rescue attempts by folic acid and nucleotides resulted in differential responses among affected tissues, suggesting that different pathomechanisms are involved in folate deficiency-induced anomalies in a tissue-specific manner. The results of the current study provide an explanation for the inconsistent outcome observed clinically in patients suffering from folate deficiency and/or receiving folate supplementation. This study also supports the use of this model for further research on the defective cardiogenesis and hematopoiesis caused by folate deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2769221121,"Traditional saliency detection algorithms lack object semantic character, and the segmentation algorithms cannot highlight the saliency of the segmentation regions. In order to compensate for the defects of these two algorithms, the salient object segmentation model, which is a novel combination of two algorithms, is established in this paper. With the help of a priori knowledge of image boundary background traits, the K-means++ algorithm is used to cluster the pixels for each region; in line with the sensitivity of the human eye to color and with its attention mechanism, the joint probability distribution of the regional contrast ratio and spatial saliency is established. The selection of the salient area is based on the probabilities, for which the region boundary is taken as the initial curve, and the level-set algorithm is used to perform the salient object segmentation of the image. The curve convergence condition is established according to the confidence level for the segmented region, thus avoiding over-convergence of the segmentation curve. With this method, the salient region boundary is adjacent to the object contour, so the curve evolution time is shorter, and compared with the traditional Li algorithm, the proposed algorithm has higher segmentation evaluation scores, with the additional benefit of emphasizing the importance of the object."
https://openalex.org/W2769480069,"Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) treatment can reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and recurrence in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. However, the risk of recurrence in CHB patients who develop HCC despite NUC treatment remains unclear.167 consecutive CHB patients receiving curative resection for HCC with NUC therapy after surgery were retrospectively enrolled. Thirty-eight patients who developed HCC despite NUC therapy for more than 1 year were defined as secondary prevention failure. The other 129 patients started NUC therapy after surgery. Factors associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated.The 5-year RFS and OS rates were 44.7% and 77.3%, respectively. Sex, BMI, BCLC stage, AFP levels and cirrhosis status were the independent predictors of RFS, while microvascular invasion was the independent predictor of OS. The RFS was comparable between patients with and without NUC secondary prevention. In the subgroup analysis, the RFS was significantly worse in cirrhotic patients with secondary prevention failure (hazard ratio = 2.373, p = 0.009). Secondary prevention failure did not have adverse impact on OS. Among 84 patients with recurrence, 58.3% of the cases remained in BCLC stage A, and 53.6% received a second curative treatment. Long-term NUC therapy may lead to a decline of non-invasive indices of hepatic fibrosis in HCC patients.In general, the risk of recurrence and survival are comparable between patients with and without secondary prevention failure. However, a higher risk of recurrence was observed in cirrhotic patients with secondary prevention failure."
https://openalex.org/W2769305996,"Vaccination is a safe and effective approach to prevent deadly diseases. To increase vaccine production, we propose that a mechanical stimulation can enhance protein production. In order to prove this hypothesis, Sf9 insect cells were used to evaluate the increase in the expression of a fusion protein from hepatitis B virus (HBV S1/S2). We discovered that the ultrasound stimulation at a frequency of 1.5 MHz, intensity of 60 mW/cm2, for a duration of 10 minutes per day increased HBV S1/S2 by 27%. We further derived a model for transport through a cell membrane under the effect of ultrasound waves, tested the key assumptions of the model through a molecular dynamics simulation package, NAMD (Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics program) and utilized CHARMM force field in a steered molecular dynamics environment. The results show that ultrasound waves can increase cell permeability, which, in turn, can enhance nutrient / waste exchange thus leading to enhanced vaccine production. This finding is very meaningful in either shortening vaccine production time, or increasing the yield of proteins for use as vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2769567667,"This paper investigates the influence of depth of field on change detection in both pictorial and solid scenes. In this work, a within-subjects experiment is conducted using a flicker paradigm, with which the hit rate and response time for change detection are obtained. The results show that depth of field has effects on change detection: the hit rate is smaller and response time is longer in the scene with small depth of field than in the scene with large depth of field or uniform blur. It is concluded that when depth of field is small and binocular disparity is not zero in a picture, the influence of depth of field on change detection is more significant than binocular disparity. This conclusion leads to the result that the change in the sharp area is detected easier and faster than in the area that is closer to the observer."
https://openalex.org/W2770997391,"Background Previous reports about the relationship between a high parathyroid hormone (PTH) and low vitamin D levels with blood pressure in different hypertension groups are conflicting. Objective We studied serum PTH and vitamin D levels in white-coat (WCHT) and sustained hypertension (SHT) patients who had not been on antihypertensive treatment. We also investigated the association between serum PTH and vitamin D levels with respect to blood pressure in SHT and WCHT patients. Methods We included 52 SHT patients (54.06 ± 9.2 years, 32 newly diagnosed and 20 previously diagnosed with SHT who had not been treated with antihypertensive medication for 3 months or more), 48 WCHT patients (53.64 ± 9.5 years), and 50 normotensive (NT) healthy controls (53.44 ± 8.4 years) in our study. In addition to routine tests, PTH and vitamin D levels were measured. Results Serum PTH levels were significantly higher in SHT patients not taking antihypertensive medications than in WCHT patients and NT controls (p = 0.004). Although PTH levels were higher in WCHT than in NT groups, the difference was not statistically significant. In SHT patients, PTH levels showed a positive correlation with office systolic (r = 0.363, p = 0.008), office diastolic (r = 0.282, p = 0.038), home systolic (r = 0.390, p = 0.004), and home diastolic blood pressures (r = 0.397, p = 0.003). Serum vitamin D levels were similar in SHT, WCHT and NT groups. Vitamin D levels were not associated with blood pressures in the entire study group. Furthermore, no significant relation was found between vitamin D and PTH levels in SHT and WCHT groups. Conclusion PTH levels are significantly higher in untreated SHT patients than WCHT patients and NT subjects. However, vitamin D levels are similar in SHT, WCHT and NT groups. There is a significant association between PTH levels and blood pressures suggesting PTH has a role in increase of blood pressure in SHT."
https://openalex.org/W2769152293,"Using the Truth Tobacco Industry Documents Library and Congressional records, we examined the tobacco industry's involvement with the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). During legislative drafting of the ADA (1989-1990), the Tobacco Institute, the tobacco industry's lobbying and public relations arm at the time, worked with industry lawyers and civil rights groups to include smoking in the ADA's definition of ""disability."" Focus was on smoking as a perceived rather than actual disability so that tobacco companies could maintain that smoking is not addictive. Language that would have explicitly excluded smoking from ADA coverage was weakened or omitted. Tobacco Institute lawyers did not think the argument that smokers are ""disabled"" would convince the courts, so in the two years after the ADA was signed into law, the Tobacco Institute paid a lawyer to conduct media tours, seminars, and write articles to convince employers that hiring only non-smokers would violate the ADA. The ultimate goal of these activities was to deter employers from promoting a healthy, tobacco-free workforce and, more broadly, to promote the social acceptability of smoking. Employers and policy makers need to be aware that tobacco use is not protected by the ADA and should not be misled by tobacco industry efforts to insinuate otherwise."
