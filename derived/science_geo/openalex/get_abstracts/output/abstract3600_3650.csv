https://openalex.org/W1508770301,"Tunicamycin, an antibiotic which prevents the glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins, inhibits the replication of both vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis virus. In tunicamycin-treated infected cells, all of the viral proteins are synthesized but the glycoproteins are devoid of carbohydrate. The nonglycosylated glycoproteins could not be detected on the outside of the plasma membrane by lactoperoxidase labeling, indirect immunofluorescence staining, or chymotrypsin treatment of intact cells, whereas the glycosylated glycoproteins were readily detected by all three methods. These results indicate that the bulk of the nonglycosylated glycoproteins are unable to undergo the normal migration to the cell surface. In contrast to the normal glycosylated viral glycoproteins, the nonglycosylated glycoproteins were insoluble in nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100. The nonglycosylated glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus could be solubilized using a combination of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.2% Triton X-100, but precipitated when the 6 M guanidine was removed by dialysis. These results suggest that the lack of carbohydrate alters the properties of the glycoproteins, which may explain their impaired mobility through the intracellular membranous system."

This suggests that wide cleft junctions are the site of sign-conserving, and narrow cleft junctions or ribbon contacts (or both) are the site of sign-inverting synaptic transmission from photoreceptors to bipolars."
https://openalex.org/W1604464466,"Abstract A Ca2+-dependent regulator protein of cyclic 3':5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) has previously been isolated from rat testis and shown to be a heat-stable, Ca2+-binding protein with a molecular weight of approximately 17,000. The Ca2+-dependent regulator protein is also structurally similar to troponin-C, the Ca2+-binding component of muscle troponin and Ca2+ mediator of muscle contraction. The present report describes a partial amino acid sequence of the Ca2+-dependent regulator. The protein (148 amino acids) is 50% homologous with skeletal muscle troponin-C, but is 11 residues shorter than the muscle protein. The Ca2+-dependent regulator protein has an NH2-terminal sequence of acetyl-Ala-Asp-Glu, a COOH-terminal sequence of Thr-Ala-Lys and 1 residue of epsilon-trimethyllysine located at position 115. All of these properties are distinct from those of other homologous Ca2+-binding proteins. These properties may account for the biological specificities demonstrated by these proteins as compared to the Ca2+-dependent regulator protein. Based on the sequence and a comparison of the Ca2+-dependent regulator protein to other calcium-binding proteins, our data support the view that all of these moecules contain common sequences, especially at their proposed metal-binding sites."

In an earlier study, the mutations have been mapped in one of three distinct loci designated OXI 1, OX1 2, and OX1 3. The OX1 1 locus is now shown to code for the mitochon- drially translated Subunit II by the following criteria: (a) in two OX1 1 mutants, cytochrome c oxidase Subunit II is replaced by a shorter mitochondrially made polypeptide which is not detected in the wild type parent; these “new” polypeptides can be identified as fragments of Subunit II by their weak, but significant cross-reaction with an antiserum against Subunit II from wild type cells. (b) When these two OX1 1 mutants are reverted by an additional mutation of mitochondrial DNA, Subunit II regains its strong interac- tion with anti-Subunit II serum, but its electrophoretic mobility on dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels is increased over that of wild type Subunit II. Electrophoresis in the presence of the cationic detergent, cetyltrimethylammo- nium bromide, determination of the free electrophoretic mobility, and peptide mapping by limited proteolysis indi- cate that the increased mobility of Subunit II in the revert- ants does not merely reflect abnormal binding of dodecyl sulfate. We conclude that the OX1 1 locus contains the structural gene for cytochrome oxidase Subunit II. Mitochondria contain a genetic system that participates in their own formation (l-4). The main function of this system appears to be the synthesis of at least nine hydrophobic polypeptides which are tightly associated with the mitochon- drial inner membrane. Three of these polypeptides are associ- * This work was supported by Grant 3.2350.74 from the Swiss National Science Foundation, a fellowship from the Sandoz Foun- dation, and Grant 75-7-0748 from DQl&$tion G&&ale B la Re- cherche Scientifique.

The function of the remaining polypep- tides is still unknown. While it is firmly established that these polypeptides are translated on mitochondrial ribosomes, no structural gene for any of these polypeptides has yet been identified (2-4). For many years it was even debated whether these structural genes were localized on nuclear rather than mitochondrial DNA (2). Recent experiments with cell-free systems pro- grammed with mitochondrial DNA (5) or RNA (6) strongly suggest, however, that at least some of the mitochondrial translation products are coded by mitochondrial DNA. This is also implied by studies which exploited the differences in electrophoretic mobility of several mitochon- drial translation products from different yeast strains (7). However, none of these efforts have led to the identification of a gene coding for a functionally defined mitochondrially made polypeptide. The present study is based on the recent demonstration (8, 9) that mutations in three loci on yeast mitochondrial DNA can lead to the selective loss of cytochrome oxidase. These loci (termed OX1 1, 2, and 3) have been mapped (9), but it remained unclear whether they were structural or regula- tory genes for cytochrome oxidase. We now report evidence which indicates that the OX1 1 locus is the structural gene for cytochrome oxidase Subunit II."
https://openalex.org/W1593764722,"Homogeneous cGMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes the rapid incorporation of phosphate, specifically into the inhibitory subunit of purified cardiac troponin with a maximal incorporation of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of troponin. When troponin was incubated in the presence of both cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases, a maximal incorporation of 1 mol of phosphate/mol of troponin was observed which suggested phosphorylation of the same site by the two kinases. Both cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases had similar Km values for troponin, but the Vmax value for the phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase was 12-fold greater than the value obtained for cGMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1594873397,"The presence of cytochrome c oxidase subunits and the association of these subunits with each other was studied in a heme-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant. This mutant had been isolated by Gollub et al. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2846-2854) and had been shown lack delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase. When grown in the absence of heme or heme precursors, the mutant is respiration-deficient, devoid of cytochrome absorption bands and auxotrophic for all those components whose biosynthesis is dependent on hemoproteins; when grown in the presence of heme or heme precursors, the mutant is phenotypically wild type. Upon growth of the mutant in the absence of heme synthesis, the mitochondria still contained two of the three mitochondrially made cytochrome c oxidase subunits (i.e. II and III) and at least one of the cytoplasmically made cytochrome c subunits (VI). The other subunits were either barely detectable (I, IV) or undetectable (V, VII). The residual subunits were apparently not assembled with each other since an antiserum directed mainly against Subunit VI failed to co-precipitate Subunits II and III which were still present. In contrast, growth of the mutant in the presence of delta-aminolevulinic acid led to the accumulation of active, fully assembled cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria. Heme a (or one of its precursors) thus controls the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase from its individual subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1673073738,"Sensitive thin layer peptide mapping is employed to establish the identity and the homogeneity of eight singly substituted 4-carboxy-2,6-dinitrophenyl derivatives of horse cytochrome c. Seven of the components, all of greater than 95% homogeneity, are modified at lysyl residues 13, 72, 87, 8, 27, 39, and 60. The eighth component is a mixture of derivatives at lysines 22 and 99. The positions of the modified residues were confirmed by the amino acid analysis and Edman sequential degradation of the CDNP-peptides. Physiochemical properties characteristic of cytochrome c are unchanged in the chemically modified products examined. These properties, that include the proton NMR spectrum, are sensitive probes of the polypeptide organization surrounding the heme prosthetic group. The lack of any discernable changes indicates that modification of the epsilon-amino groups on the surface of cytochrome c does not perturb the overall structure of the protein. The widespread distribution of the modifications on the surface of the molecule, together with the homogeneity and native conformation of the CDNP-derivatives make them well suited for assessing the effects of changes in the charge topography on the electron transfer activity of cytochrome c."

https://openalex.org/W1564061572,The self-association of apo-A-I isolated from the human high density lipoprotein complex has been investigated by gel permeation chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium. The apparent weight average molecular weight (MWapp) versus Apo-A-I concentration profile was found to be sensitive to ionic strength and pressure; MWapp increased with increasing ionic strength and decreasing rotor speed. The data were consistent with a monomer-dimer-tetrameroctamer association shceme over all conditions investigated if a change in the partial specific volume of apo-A-I upon association of 5.5 x 10(-2) ml/g is postulated.
https://openalex.org/W1482099760,"Cyclic AMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of cardiac troponin inhibitory subunit (TN-I). Unlike many substrates utilized by both kinases, TN-I is rapidly phosphorylated using relatively low concentrations of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (0.01 to 0.1 micrometer). At low concentrations of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, approximately twice as much total phosphate is incorporated into TN-I using the cAMP-dependent enzyme. At higher enzyme concentrations, 1 mol of phosphate/mol of TN-I is found using either enzyme. Maximal levels of cAMP- and CGMP-dependent protein kinases do not catalyze additive phosphorylation, suggesting that the two enzymes catalyze the phosphorylation of the same site on TN-I. The results support the concept of overlapping substrate specificity for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, but suggest that cardiac troponin contains additional specificity determinants for the cGMP-dependent protein kinase not found in several other protein substrates."

Normal fibroblasts and fibroblasts infected with the temperature-sensitive mutant and cultured at the nonpermissive temperature-sensitive mutant and cultured at the nonpermissive temperature, secreted procollagen into the medium and incorporated collagen into their extracellular matrix. On the other hand, transformed fibroblasts and fibroblasts infected with the temperature-sensitive mutant and cultured at the permissive temperature, were able to secrete procollagen into the medium, but there was no evidence that they were able to convert procollagen to collagen and incorporate collagen into an extracellular matrix. The inability of the infected cells to incorporate collagen into an extracellular matrix was found to be a result of transformation rather than of virus production in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1490919840,"Abstract The effect of 7-methylguanosine 5'-monophosphate (pm7G) on mRNA translation was examined in the wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte cell-free systems. Differences between the two cell extracts with respect to inhibition of translation by pm7G can be attributed to different conditions commonly used for in vitro protein synthesis. Inhibition of globin mRNA translation by pm7G is strongly influenced by the concentration of potassium salt and to a lesser extent by incubation temperature. The effectiveness of the inhibitor increases with potassium salt concentration and diminishes with increasing temperature. Translation is inhibited by pm7G at physiological K+ concentration in both cell-free systems in that only the rate of binding of mRNA to ribosomes is affected by the inhibitor, not the extent of binding. Translation of different capped mRNAs is affected differently by pm7G, but this appears to be property of the mRNA rather than the translation system. These results indicate that while the 5'-terminal cap structure may be more important for translation of some mRNA's than others, this structure functions in translation of capped mRNAs in all types of cells."

The heme d1 can be removed from the enzyme with acidified acetone leaving an apoenzyme that contains heme c but has no oxidase activity. Reconstitution of the apoenzyme in neutral 6 M urea with heme d1 yields a reconstituted product which, after removal of the urea, has 90 to 100% of the oxidase activity of the native enzyme, a 1:1 molar ratio of the heme groups, and is indistinguishable from the native on the basis of its absorption spectral properties and its EPR spectrum. The apoenzyme can also be reconstituted with heme a, deuteroheme, hematoheme, mesoheme, and protoheme but only the heme a yields a product with any oxidase activity. The properties of these reconstituted products are compared."

https://openalex.org/W1574799732,"The kinetics of synthesis and incorporation of the photosynthetic pigments and several of the major oxidative and photosynthetic electron transport components of Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides have been studied during synchronous and asynchronous phototrophic growth. The photosynthetic pigments and cytochromes c and b, measured spectroscopically, exhibited continuous patterns of synthesis and incorporation into the membrane particulate fraction in both synchronous and asynchronous cultures. Succinic dehydrogenase and NADH-oxidase activities, present at low levelnous growth. In a previous paper, Leuking, D.R., Fraley, R.T., and Kaplan, S. ((1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 451-457) have shown that total cellular phospholipid is also accumulated discontinuously during synchronous growth. A continuously incorporated membrane component is thus subject to a wide variation in the membrane protein/lipid ratio. The significance of this ratio in regulating the activity of membrane proteins is discussed and the distinction between protein incorporation and function is drawn with particular reference to the photosynthetic pigments and cytochrome components and the oxidative activities measured. It is suggested that a dependence of membrane protein activity on the membrane protein to lipid ratio in vivo is of possible significance in the control of membrane synthesis and cell division."

https://openalex.org/W1596428171,"A homogeneous preparation of venom phosphodiesterase from Crotalus adamanteus possesses an intrinsic endonuclease activity, specific for superhelical (form I) and single-stranded DNA. The phosphodiesterase degrades single-stranded T7 DNA by endonucleolytic cleavages. Duplex T7 DNA is hydrolyzed by the liberation of acid-soluble products simultaneously from the 3' and 5' termini but without demonstrable internal scissions in duplex regions. Since venom phosphodiesterase is known to hydrolyze oligonucleotides stepwise from the 3' termini, the cleavage at the 5' end of duplex T7 DNA is ascribed to an endonuclease activity. Form I PM2 DNA is nicked to yield first relaxed circles and then linear DNA which is subsequently hydrolyzed only from the chain termini. The linear duplex DNA intermediates consist of a discrete series of fragments (11 are usually resolved on agarose gels) with initial molecular weights ranging from 6.3 x 10(6) (the intact PM2 DNA size) to approximately 1 x 10(6). The cleavage of the form I molecule must, therefore, occur at a limited number of unique sites. The enzyme also cleaves nonsuperhelical, covalently closed circular PM2 DNA but at a 10(4) times slower rate. Both the endonuclease activity on form I DNA and the known exonuclease activity co-migrate on polyacrtkanude gels, are optimally active at pH 9, are stimulated by small concentrations of Mg2+, and are similarly inactivated by heat, reducing agents, and EDTA."

https://openalex.org/W1537563232,"The mode of transport of a nonphosphorylated adenosine analog, 5'-deoxyadenosine, was studied in murine leukemia L1210 cells. This compound is not subject to the action of intracellular nucleoside-trapping kinases, and its transport can be examined without regard for effects of experimental conditions on kinase activity. Accumulation of 5'-deoxyadenosine was rapid, and nonconcentrative, with equilibrium attained within 12 s at 37 degrees. Kinetic studies were carried out at 20 degrees. We found both a nonmediated (diffusion) and a mediated transport process. The latter had an apparent Km fo 115 micrometer, Vmax = 105 pmol/10(6) cells/min. Uptake of 5'-deoxyadenosine was inhibited by several heterologous nucleosides including adenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, thymine riboside, and inosine. Like 2'-deoxyadenosine, 5'-deoxyadenosine was more lipid-soluble than adenosine (from octanol/water partition studies). Compared with 5'-deoxyadenosine, adenosine had a much lower apparent Km (5 micrometer) and a higher Q10 over the 27-37 degrees range (3.0 versus 1.3). Data obtained with adenosine might, however, reflect properties of intracellular adenosine kinase interacting with a transport process."
https://openalex.org/W1633373589,"2-Nitropropane dioxygenase, purified to homogeneity from a yeast, Hansenula mrakii, is significantly inhibited by superoxide dismutase and various scavengers for superoxide anion such as cytochrome c, epinephrine, NADH, thiols, and polyhydric phenols. The reduction of cytochrome c and the oxidation of epinephrine and NADH are concomitant with the inhibition of enzymatic oxygenation. Neither the oxidation nor the reduction occursin the presence of superoxide dismutase or in the absence of 2-nitropropane or oxygen. Superoxide anion added externally induces the oxygenation. These findings indicate the generation of superoxide anion and its participation in the oxygenation of 2-nitropropane. The difference spectrum of the binding of NADH to 2-nitropropane dioxygenase exhibits a negative peak at 353 nm. One mole of NADH is bound to 1 mol of the enzyme and the pro-R hydrogen of the nicotinamide moiety of bound NADH predominantly is transferred to superoxide anion formed enzymatically or given externally. Thus, the diastereotopic hydrogen of NADH is discriminated by the enzyme, although not completely."

A remarkably microheterogeneous pattern of increased fluorescence resulted from a critical level of incomplete cerebral ischemia. The fluorescence pattern suggests that ischemia occurs initially in microwatershed zones between penetrating cerebral arteries.

This study lends credence to that conjecture through comparative physicochemical investigations involving peptide mapping, circular dichroism, and immunological techniques. The data indicate that despite differences in function, both enzymes apparently manifest a high degree of similarity in primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. Mapping data also indicate that each protein is comprised of two apparently identical subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1528604573,"The rates of both forward and reverse electron transfer in phosphorylating submitochondrial particles from bovine heart can be controlled by the thermodynamic phosphorylation potential (deltaGp) of the adenine nucleotide system. deltaGp is the Gibbs free energy of ATP synthesis and is defined by the relationship deltaGp = -deltaG'o + RTln([ATP]/[ADP][Pi]) where deltaG'o is the standard free energy of ATP hydrolysis. Studies of the effects of deltaGp on NADH respiration and the reduction of NAD+ by succinate show that increasing values of deltaGp cause an inhibition of forward electron transfer and a stimulation of reverse electron transfer. Between deltaGp values of 7.6 and 13.0 kcal/mol the rate of NADH respiration decreased 3-fold and the rate of NAD+ reduction by succinate increased 3-fold. Indirect phosphorylation potential titration experiments as well as direct chemical measurements indicate that steady state levels of ATP, ADP, and Pi are established during NADH respiration which correspond to a deltaGp equal to 10.7 to 11.4 kcal/mol."

It was confirmed that such an increase appears to occur, but it was also demonstrated that it is not a real increase. With growth of the tumor, the electron spin resonance lines for lyophilized samples became narrower, resulting in an increase in peak-to-peak height measurements, but there was no change in the total number of spins. The signals for lyophilized tumor samples were different from those for the same samples before lyophilization. Changes in line shape indicated that lyophilized tumor samples contain a different mixture of radicals than lyophilized samples of normal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1576386207,"Incubation of homogenates of rat renal cortex at 4 degrees resulted in increased cAMP phosphodiesterase activity; the increase was much more rapid in hypotonic medium than in one of physiological tonicity. cAMP phosphodiesterase activity did not increase with incubation of supernatant fractions (48,000 x g, 20 min) prepared from isotonic homogenates. Extraction of the isotonic particulate fraction with hypotonic buffer released an activator which increased cAMP phosphodiesterase activity of the supernatant fraction. The kidney phosphodiesterase activator differed from a heat-stable, calcium-dependent protein activator of phosphodiesterase in that it was destroyed by heating (90 degrees for 10 min) and was not inhibited by EGTA. The phosphodiesterases of rat renal cortex were partially resolved by chromatography on DEAE-Bio-Gel, and a cAMP phosphodiesterase that is sensitive to the kidney activator was identified. This phosphodiesterase was separable from that affected by a calcium-dependent phosphodiesterase activator from bovine brain and from cGMP-stimulated cAMP phosphodiesterase. As determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, after incubation with the kidney activator, the activated form of phosphodiesterase had a lower sedimentation velocity than did the unactivated form."

The PRPP concentrations increased 20- to 50-fold and PRPP synthetase activity 3-fold in cells from patients with the Lesch-Nyham syndrome when aminopterin, an inhibitor of de novo purine synthesis, was added to the medium. Concentrations of PRPP and PRPP synthetase activity did not increase in control cells in medium containing aminopterin unless hypoxanthine was removed from the medium. Exposure of cells to cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, prevented the induction of PRPP synthetase and the formation of high PRPP concentrations. Cells from a patient with a mutant HPRT with a high Michaelis constant for PRPP increased PRPP levels and PRPP synthetase activity to a new steady state when they were grown in medium containing aminopterin. Inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis, the presence of hypoxanthine in the medium, and mutant HPRT activity affect the regulation of PRPP levels and PRPP synthetase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1500489065,"Several recent studies of protein the unfolded proteins. In urea- and guanidine HCl-unfolded ferricytochrome c (horse heart), an acid-induced spin state transformation of the heme group has been detected by the heme absorptions, Trp-59 fluorescence, and the intrinsic viscosity of protein. Kinetics of this second conformational transition, by the temperature jump and stopped flow methods, are complex. One rapid reaction (tau1), pH-independent, occurs in a 50-mus range; the second reaction (tau2), in a 1-ms range, depends linearly upon pH and is faster at the alkaline side; a third reaction (tau3), in a 1-s range, shows a sigmoidal transition at pH 5.1 and is faster at the acidic side. The results are consistent with a kinetic scheme which involves protein conformational changes in the transformation of the heme coordination state. The kinetics, along with previous equilibrium studies, indicate that ligand or charge interactions within a protein molecule are not completely prohibited even in strongly denaturing conditions, such as in high concentrations of urea and guanidine HCl. Thus, local structures of peptide chain associated with these interactions can exist in the unfolded protein."

https://openalex.org/W1546330179,"Abstract We report here a new approach to the study of the conformation of enzymes in the presence of specific substrates. Rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase was attached to CL-Sepharose via a cleavable spacer arm (-NH-(CH2)6NHCO(CH2)2SS(CH2)2CO-). The bound lactate dehydrogenase was digested with subtilisin BPN' in the presence of substrates of lactate dehydrogenase. The use of a flow system permits the maintenance of saturating levels of substrates. Proteolysis was followed by loss of activity of the enzyme column. The time course of proteolysis in the presence of either NADH, NAD+, or pyruvate alone did not differ from the control. However, when NADH and pyruvate were present simultaneously, the enzyme became more susceptible to proteolysis. The initial rate of proteolysis was increased by 40%. The abortive ternary complex (lactate dehydrogenase - NAD+ - pyruvate) also showed an increase in susceptibility to proteolysis. These findings clearly show that the productive ternary complex (lactate dehydrogenase - NADH - pyruvate) is conformationally different from the apoenzyme and binary complexes under optimal catalytic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1521843940,"The sedimentation behavior of canine apolipoprotein (apo) A-I in 0.02 M EDTA, pH 8.6, was studied as a function of protein concentration by the techniques of sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifuge. At concentrations of less than 1 g/liter, apo-A-I exhibited a monomodal sedimentation pattern, with apparent sedimentation coefficients which varied from 2.3 to 3.5 S with increasing protein concentrations. Above 1.5 g/liter, apo-A-I had two well resolved peaks with s20,w values of 4.15 S and 5.75 S. The proportion of the 5.75 S component increased with increasing apo-A-I concentrations, with a concomitant decrease of the 4.15 S component. By sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation with both the conventional and meniscus-depletion methods, the apparent weight-average molecular weight of apo-A-I was found to be concentration-dependent. At a protein concentration of 5.25 g/liter, an apparent weight average molecular weight of 138,000 was determined, indicating that molecular species larger than a tetramer (monomer molecular weight = 28,000) were present in solution. When analyzed in terms of a reversible self-associating system, the experimental data could best be described according to a monomer-dimer-tetramer-octamer model, as previously reported from human apo-A-I (Vitello, L. B., and Scanu, A. M. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1131-1136). The equilibrium constants were: K2 = 4.5 liters/g, K4 = 470 liters3/g3, and K8 = 41,600 liters7/g7, respectively."
