https://openalex.org/W2039964833,"We used affinity chromatography to probe for a direct binding interaction between cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin. Purified cytoplasmic dynein was found to bind to an affinity column of p150<sup>Glued</sup>, the largest polypeptide in the dynactin complex. To test the specificity of the interaction, we loaded rat brain cytosol onto the p150<sup>Glued</sup> affinity column and observed that cytoplasmic dynein from cytosol was specifically retained on the column. Preincubation of the p150<sup>Glued</sup> affinity matrix with excess exogenous dynein intermediate chain resulted in a significant reduction of dynein binding, suggesting that p150<sup>Glued</sup> may be interacting with dynein via this polypeptide. Therefore we constructed an affinity column of recombinant dynein intermediate chain and observed that dynactin was retained from rat brain cytosol. These results demonstrate that the native dynein and dynactin complexes are capable of direct <i>in vitro</i> interaction mediated by a direct binding of the dynein intermediate chain to the p150<sup>Glued</sup>component of the dynactin complex. We have mapped the site of this interaction to the amino-terminal region of p150<sup>Glued</sup>, which is predicted to form an α-helical coiled-coil. Regulation of the dynein-dynactin interaction may prove to be key in the control mechanism for cytoplasmic dynein-mediated vesicular transport."

A., Wickman, K., Velimirovic, B., Krapivinsky, L., and Clapham, D. E. (1995) Nature 374, 135-141). We report the cloning of a mouse GIRK2 splice variant, noted mGIRK2A. Both channel proteins are functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes upon injection of their cRNA, alone or in combination with the GIRK1 cRNA. Three GIRK channels, mGIRK1-3, are shown to be present in the brain. Colocalization in the same neurons of mGIRK1 and mGIRK2 supports the hypothesis that native channels are made by an heteromeric subunit assembly. GIRK3 channels have not been expressed successfully, even in the presence of the other types of subunits. However, GIRK3 chimeras with the amino- and carboxyl-terminal of GIRK2 are functionally expressed in the presence of GIRK1. The expressed mGIRK2 and mGIRK1, -2 currents are blocked by Ba2+ and Cs+ ions. They are not regulated by protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Channel activity runs down in inside-out excised patches, and ATP is required to prevent this rundown. Since the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PCP is also active and since addition of kinases A and C as well as alkaline phosphatase does not modify the ATP effect, it is concluded that ATP hydrolysis is not required. An ATP binding process appears to be essential for maintaining a functional state of the neuronal inward rectifier K+ channel. A Na+ binding site on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane acts in synergy with the ATP binding site to stabilize channel activity.

https://openalex.org/W2072061824,"The prototype mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase module is a three-kinase cascade consisting of the MAP kinase, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1 or ERK2, the MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) MEK1 or MEK2, and the MEK kinase, Raf-1 or B-Raf. This and other MAP kinase modules are thought to be critical signal transducers in major cellular events including proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses. To identify novel mammalian MAP kinase modules, polymerase chain reaction was used to isolate a new MEK family member, MEK5, from the rat. MEK5 is more closely related to MEK1 and MEK2 than to the other known mammalian MEKs, MKK3 and MKK4. MEK5 is thought to lie in an uncharacterized MAP kinase pathway, because MEK5 does not phosphorylate the ERK/MAP kinase family members ERK1, ERK2, ERK3, JNK/SAPK, or p38/HOG1, nor will Raf-1, c-Mos, or MEKK1 highly phosphorylate it. Alternative splicing results in a 50-kDa α and a 40-kDa β isoform of MEK5. MEK5β is ubiquitously distributed and primarily cytosolic. MEK5α is expressed most highly in liver and brain and is particulate. The 23 amino acids encoded by the 5′ exon in the larger α isoform are similar to a sequence found in certain proteins believed to associate with the actin cytoskeleton; this alternatively spliced modular domain may lead to the differential subcellular localization of MEK5α.

https://openalex.org/W2095141538,"α4β1 integrin (VLA-4) appears to be unique among the leukocyte integrins in that it can initiate the adhesion of circulating lymphocytes without cellular activation. It is not known how lymphocytes or other cell types maintain constitutive levels of α4β1 integrin activity. The current report describes a monoclonal antibody, 15/7, that recognizes a high affinity or ligand-occupied conformation of β1 integrin. Studies with 15/7 revealed that α4β1 integrin-dependent adhesion of leukocytic cell lines is mediated by a population of low affinity receptors that is conformationally responsive to ligand; the 15/7 epitope could be induced by nanomolar concentrations of soluble VCAM-1 or by micromolar concentrations of a peptide derived from the type III connecting segment domain of fibronectin (as ligands for α4β1 integrin). The same receptors were also responsive to adhesion activating reagents, such as Mn2+, activating anti-β1 integrin antibodies, and phorbol myristate acetate, which induced the 15/7 epitope directly and/or decreased the concentration of ligand required for epitope induction. In addition to the responsive receptor pool, cells expressed a second population of α4β1 integrin that was conformationally restrained, failing to respond to ligand or to any of the activating reagents. The relative size of the responsive and inactive receptor pools, as well as the affinity of the responsive receptors, represented a stable phenotype of different cell types and played important roles in defining the cells' adhesive capacity and ligand specificity. Similar receptor populations were measured on lymphocyte subsets in whole blood. These studies provide insight into how cells maintain different constitutive levels of α4β1 integrin activity, and how the activity of β1 integrin can be modulated by activators of cell adhesion. α4β1 integrin (VLA-4) appears to be unique among the leukocyte integrins in that it can initiate the adhesion of circulating lymphocytes without cellular activation.

Furthermore, PMP22 mRNA expression is widespread during mouse embryonic development (23Baechner D. Liehr T. Hameister H. Altenberger H. Grehl H. Suter U. Rautenstrauss B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue-specific expression and regulation of PMP22 is controlled by a complex genetic mechanism involving two alternative promoter sequences(24Suter U.

While the distal promoter is specifically activated in myelinating Schwann cells, the more proximal promoter was found to be active in all known PMP22-expressing tissues(24Suter U. Snipes G.J.

Ruaro M.E. Del Sal G. Philipson L. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2924-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 27Schneider C. King R.M. Philipson L.

Murphy, submitted for publication.) In support of this hypothesis, recent studies employing retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of PMP22 into cultured Schwann cells suggest a pronounced influence of PMP22 expression on the length of the G1 phase (28Zoidl G. Blass-Kampmann S. D'Urso D. Schmalenbach C. Müller H.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Based on these findings, it was proposed that PMP22 serves a general role in cell physiology and an additional specialized function in PNS myelin(29Suter U. Snipes G.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, all known mutations affecting the PMP22 are associated with a phenotype restricted to the PNS, and no consistent abnormalities in non-neural tissues have been detected, even in genetically engineered mice that are completely devoid of PMP22(30Adlkofer K. Martini R. Aguzzi A. Zielasek J. Toyka K.V. Suter U. Nat. Genet. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for these apparently contradictory results is to postulate specific mechanisms that can compensate for the lack of PMP22 in non-neural tissues. Such processes may involve molecules that are structurally and/or functionally related to PMP22. However, although the putative membrane topology of PMP22 is similar to the gap junction-forming connexin protein family (31Falk M.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or the tight junction component occludin(32Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), PMP22 does not display convincing amino acid sequence identity with any other known protein.In this study, we report the identification of a PMP22-related transcript and the characterization of its encoded protein, which we have designated epithelial membrane protein-1 (EMP-1) based on its tissue expression pattern. EMP-1 and PMP22 are significantly related in their overall structure and primary amino acid sequences and define a novel gene family that also includes a more distant relative, the lens-specific membrane protein MP20(33Kumar N.M.

Both sciatic nerves were exposed, and the right nerve was cut approximately 2 mm distal to the hip joint(17Snipes G.J. Suter U. Welcher A.A. Shooter E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed 4 days after injury in a CO2 atmosphere. For isolation of RNA and protein, tissues were excised and either lysed directly into 5 M GT buffer (5 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (Ultrapure, Life Technologies, Inc.), 25 mM sodium citrate, and 0.5% sodium N-lauryolsarcosine), or 8 M urea, or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.Cloning and Sequencing of EMP-1 cDNARecombinant clones were isolated from a fetal rat intestine cDNA library. Plasmid inserts were analyzed by automated sequencing in both orientations. The resulting nucleotide sequences were compared with the GenBank™ data base to identify known and related sequences. EMP-1 cDNA was identified as being significantly related to rat PMP22, and the 981-base pair cDNA clone was sequenced on both strands. The sequence was screened for open reading frames by translation in all frames. The longest open reading frame was compared with protein data bases and again showed significant similarity to PMP22. Computer-assisted sequence analysis was performed using the GCG software package to produce hydrophobicity profiles, identify signal peptide cleavage sites, and predict surface probability. The EMP-1 and PMP22 polypeptide sequences were compared using the Pileup program and depicted graphically by Prettyplot to show amino acid residues conserved between EMP-1 and the PMP22 species homologues.In Vitro Transcription and TranslationBoth the EMP-1 and mouse PMP22 cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA-1 expression vector downstream of the bacteriophage T7 promoter region and used for in vitro transcription/translation assays. mRNA was produced from 0.5 μg of DNA with T7 polymerase and translated in vitro in the presence or absence of canine microsomal membranes (CMM) using a reticulocyte lysate system (TNT, Promega). The translation products were labeled metabolically by including [35S]methionine in the reaction. The specificity of the reaction was tested using the vector pcDNA-1 as a control. The efficiency of the CMM was tested with the control reagents α-factor (glycosylation) and prolactin (signal peptide cleavage) according to the manufacturer's instructions (TNT, Promega). One-tenth of the translation product was denatured in 1% SDS and incubated for 4 h at 37°C with 1 unit of N-glycosidase F in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 12.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM sodium azide, 25% glycerol, and 0.2% SDS. The proteins were separated by reducing 15% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were subsequently fixed 30 min in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid and treated with enhancer (NEF-981G, Dupont). After drying the gels were exposed to x-ray film (RX, Fuji) overnight at -70°C.Isolation of Total RNA and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was extracted from rat tissues using a modified acid phenol method. Briefly, tissues were homogenized into GT buffer(34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). The lysate was cleared and extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1). The RNA was precipitated, resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O, and quantified by A260/A280 measurement. Ten μg of total RNA was loaded onto denaturing 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gels. Separated RNA was transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Corp.) by capillarity and cross-linked with 240 mJ of UV irradiation in a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Equal loading and transfer to the membrane was assessed by ethidium bromide staining. Membranes were prehybridized for 6 h and hybridized 36 h at 42°C in a solution containing 50% formamide. cDNA fragments of PMP22 and EMP-1 containing the entire open reading frames were labeled with 32P-dCTP by random hexamer priming (Oligolabeling kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Northern blots were washed at high stringency and exposed to x-ray film (RX, Fuji) for 12-72 h.Tissue CultureRat Schwann cells were isolated from the sciatic nerve of neonatal rats using the method of Brockes et al.(35Brockes J.P. Fields K.L. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) with modifications as described previously(19Pareek S. Suter U. Snipes G.J. Welcher A.A. Shooter E.M. Murphy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10372-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitogen-expanded primary rat Schwann cells were cultured on poly-L-lysine coated culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 20 μg/ml crude glial growth factor, 5 μg/ml forskolin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin(19Pareek S. Suter U. Snipes G.J. Welcher A.A. Shooter E.M. Murphy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10372-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Schwann cell-derived cell line, D6P2T (36Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was grown in plastic culture dishes in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The cells were split into two groups and cultured in the same medium without forskolin. After 3 days, the cells had reached 70% confluency; one group of cells were treated with 20 μg/ml forskolin for 36 h, while the second was maintained in the absence of forskolin. Subsequently, the cells were harvested in 5 M GT buffer, and total RNA was extracted as described above.NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured, and growth was arrested by serum deprivation as described previously(24Suter U. Snipes G.J. Schoener-Scott R. Welcher A.A. Pareek S. Lupski J.R. Murphy R.A. Shooter E.M. Patel P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing and growth-arrested cells were harvested into 5 M GT buffer.Preparation of the EMP-1 Expression Construct and Transient Transfection of COS CellsThe EMP-1 cDNA shown in Fig. 1 was subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pcDNA1 (InVitrogen) expression vector, downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The parent vector without cDNA insert was used in the negative control transfections. Recombinant DNA was purified by QIAGEN column isolation and quantitated by A260. COS cells exponentially growing in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted at 800 g. 1.5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μg of vector DNA. The cells were chilled on ice for 5 min, transferred to a 4-mm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad), and electroporated with 300 V and 125 microfarads. The transfected cells were chilled for 5 min on ice and split into seven 35-mm culture dishes containing 2 ml of DMEM and 10% fetal calf serum and cultured for 48 h. The cells were then washed with Tris-buffered saline, fixed in DMEM containing 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed with Tris-buffered saline, and permeabilized for 30 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin. Unspecific binding sites were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% porcine skin gelatin (type A Sigma), 2% goat serum, and 0.1% saponin. The cells were incubated with the anti-EMP-1 antibodies diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer containing 0.02% saponin overnight at 4°C followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Cappel) at 1:200 in blocking buffer with 0.02% saponin. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted using AF1 (Citifluor), and immunoreactivity was visualized by confocal microscopy with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 scanner in conjunction with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope using Imaris image processing software (Bitplane AG, Technopark Zürich, Switzerland). Preimmune serum (1:500) as primary antiserum was used as a negative control.AntibodiesAnti-peptide antibodies were raised to synthetic peptides representing the first and second putative extracellular loops of EMP-1: Loop 1, Asp50-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ser-Tyr-Gyl-Asn-Asp-Asp-Ala-Iso-Lys-Ala63-Cys-COOH; Loop 2, Tyr116-Thr-His-His-Tyr-Ala-His-Ser-Glu-Gly-Asn-Phe-Phe-Pro-Ser-Ser- His-Gln-Gly-Tyr-Cys136-COOH.Amino acids are numbered according to the cDNA-predicted polypeptide shown in Fig. 1. A C-terminal cysteine residue was added to the loop 1 peptide for coupling purposes. The peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described previously(17Snipes G.J. Suter U. Welcher A.A. Shooter E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The conjugates were used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits with Freund's complete adjuvant, and the animals were boosted 4 times with 500 μg of peptide and incomplete adjuvant at 2-week intervals. Blood was taken from the animals, and serum was isolated. The activity of the immune serum was tested on the immunogen by solid phase ELISA.Protein Preparation and Western Blot AnalysisRat tissues were homogenized into 8 M urea and cleared at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was assessed by Bradford assay, and 50 μg of protein were denatured by heating to 95°C for 3 min in sample buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol and loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to test transfer efficiency. Blots were blocked with 0.15% casein in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 (Sigma), incubated with the polyclonal rabbit sera at a dilution of 1:500 in blocking buffer followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:5000, Sigma). Detection was by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) and exposure of x-ray film (RX, Fuji).Tissue Preparation and ImmunofluorescenceStomach was removed from adult SIV rats, cut into blocks 10 by 5 mm, and snap-frozen into OCT mounting medium (Tissue Tech) in isopentane on liquid nitrogen. Ten-μm frozen sections were cut and thaw-mounted onto slides coated with 0.5% gelatin and 0.05% potassium chromate. The sections were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Unspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h with goat serum diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C or for 4 h at room temperature with a 1:500 dilution of primary antiserum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 followed by 2 h with a 1:200 dilution of Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, sections were coated with AF1 (Citifluor), and coverslips were mounted. Immune reactivity was visualized by high resolution confocal microscopy. Preimmune serum (1:500) as primary antiserum was used as a negative control.RESULTSCloning of an EMP-1 cDNA and Predicted Structure of the EMP-1 ProteinDuring a fetal rat intestine cDNA sequencing project, a 981-base pair cDNA containing an open reading frame of 480 nucleotides was identified (Fig. 1). The predicted EMP-1 polypeptide of 160 amino acid residues has a calculated molecular weight of approximately 18 kDa, and computer-assisted analysis reveals that amino acid residues 1-28, 64-89, 95-117, and 134-157 represent four hydrophobic, potentially membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 2B). The amino-terminal 16 amino acids have the characteristics of a signal peptide including a signal peptidase cleavage site after alanine 16 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a single consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation is present at asparagine 43 (Figure 1, Figure 2B).Figure 2Predicted EMP-1 structure and amino acid sequence comparison of PMP22/EMP-1 family members. A, amino acid sequence comparison between rat EMP-1 and rat, mouse, and human PMP22. Identical residues are boxed. B, hypothetical topology of EMP-1 in a lipid bilayer based on computer-assisted hydrophobicity plots and secondary structure predictions. Residues identical to rat PMP22 are filled. Most of the point mutations in PMP22 known to result in hereditary peripheral neuropathies (diamonds) are conserved at the corresponding positions in EMP-1. The Y-shaped symbol indicates a potential N-linked carbohydrate chain. C, amino acid comparison of the three known PMP22/EMP-1/MP20 family members. The residues conserved between MP20 and PMP22 or EMP-1 are shown in white on black.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EMP-1 Is a Member of a Gene FamilyComparison of the EMP-1 cDNA sequence to the GenBank™ data base identified PMP22 as the closest known relative with a nucleotide identity of 58% over the open reading frame (data not shown). Both the predicted EMP-1 protein and PMP22 are polypeptides of 160 amino acids that show 40% amino acid identity (Fig. 2A). The putative four membrane-spanning regions of EMP-1 and PMP22 are particularly well conserved. The first and second of these hydrophobic domains exhibit the highest degree of amino acid identity at 54 and 67%, respectively, while the third and fourth are only 30 and 37% identical.Fig. 2B depicts a theoretical model of the EMP-1 protein structure based on the hydrophobicity profile and the suggested structure of PMP22. Filled circles represent identical amino acid residues that are shared by rat EMP-1 and rat PMP22, while divergent residues are shown as open circles. The positions of the amino acids in PMP22 known to cause hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies (21Suter U. Patel P.I. Hum. Mutat. 1994; 3: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) when mutated are highlighted in the EMP-1 sequence as diamonds (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, all of these mutations lie within the putative membrane-spanning domains, and five of the six residues are conserved in rat EMP-1. The conservation of these amino acid residues suggests that they may be of functional significance.Additional data base searches with the EMP-1 and PMP22 sequences revealed that both display 30% amino acid identity to the lens fiber cell protein MP20(33Kumar N.M. Jarvis L.J. Tenbroek E. Louis C.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MP20 is a 173-amino acid protein with similar structural features to EMP-1 and PMP22 (Fig. 2C). If MP20 is compared with PMP22 and EMP-1 simultaneously, the amino acid identity increases to 36% including strongly conserved motifs in the putative transmembrane domains (Fig. 2C).EMP-1 Is Glycosylated in Vitro but Its Signal Sequence Is Not CleavedThe EMP-1 cDNA shown in Fig. 1 was transcribed and translated in vitro (Fig. 3). The translation product in the absence of CMMs has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 18 kDa, which is in agreement with the calculated molecular mass of the EMP-1 protein. Translation in the presence of CMM results in a 4-6-kDa increase in molecular mass consistent with the presence of the single putative N-linked glycosylation site in the EMP-1 amino acid sequence (Fig. 3). This migrational shift can be reversed by deglycosylating the translation product with N-glycosidase F (Fig. 3). The deglycosylated protein migrates identically to the unglycosylated EMP-1 protein, suggesting that the putative N-terminal signal peptide is not removed during EMP-1 protein biosynthesis. A similar modification of PMP22 was seen with CMM, confirming previous reports of endogenous PMP22 carrying an uncleaved signal peptide(37Kitamura K. Sakamoto Y. Suzuki M. Uyemura K. Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Glycoconjugates. Japan Scientific Society Press, Tokyo1981: 273-274Google Scholar).Figure 3In vitro transcription and translation of EMP-1 and PMP22 cDNAs. The [35S]methionine metabolically labeled proteins were separated by reducing 15% SDS-PAGE. pcDNA-1 was used as a control, and no nonspecific proteins can be detected. The EMP-1 cDNA generated an 18-kDa protein that shows a tendency to aggregate (EMP-1). Transcription and translation of the EMP-1 cDNA in the presence of CMM results in a reduced rate of migration of the protein (EMP-1 + CMM). This reduced migration is reversed by deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F (EMP-1 deglycosylated). The PMP22 cDNA generates an 18-kDa protein whose apparent molecular weight increases by 4-6 kDa when the reaction is performed in the presence of CMM (PMP22 + CMM). Treatment with N-glycosidase F reduced the molecular mass back to 18 kDa (PMP22 deglycosylated). Neither EMP-1 nor PMP22 are substrates for signal peptidase in vitro as indicated by the identical migration rate of the unglycosylated (EMP-1, PMP22) and deglycosylated translation products (EMP-1 deglycosylated, PMP22 deglycosylated). Prolactin (a) is a substrate for signal peptidase"
https://openalex.org/W1986894628,"Triabin, a new thrombin inhibitor, has been purified from the saliva of Triatoma pallidipennis, a blood-sucking triatomine bug. It forms a noncovalent complex with thrombin at a molar ratio of 1:1, inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, and prolongs thrombin clotting time and activated partial thromboplastin time. However, it only minimally suppresses the amidolytic activity of thrombin, as measured by a chromogenic peptide substrate assay. It completely blocks trypsin-catalyzed cleavage of thrombin, probably via protection of the anion-binding exosite and inhibits the effect of thrombomodulin on thrombin in a dose-dependent fashion. These results indicate that the inhibitor is directed toward the anion-binding exosite of thrombin. The protein was partially sequenced and the information used to isolate cDNA clones from a T. pallidipennis salivary gland library. Four slightly polymorphic variants coding for mature proteins of 142 amino acids preceded by a putative leader sequence were obtained. The recombinant protein expressed in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli has a biological activity similar to that of salivary triabin, as tested in a thrombin-induced platelet aggregation assay. In addition, recombinant triabin inhibits thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of fibrinogen with a Ki of about 3 pM.

In addition, recombinant triabin inhibits thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of fibrinogen with a Ki of about 3 pM. Evolution has provided hematophageous animals with specific mechanisms to interfere with blood coagulation. Factor Xa inhibitors were isolated from the leech Haementeria officinalis(1Tuszynski G.P. Gasic T.B. Gasic G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9718-9723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the tick Ornithodoros moubata(2Waxman L. Smith D.E. Arcuri K.E. Vlasuk G.P. Science. 1990; 248: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Likewise, several proteins which inhibit thrombin have been described. The most widely known is hirudin, which was identified almost 40 years ago in the leech Hirudo medicinalis(3Markwardt F. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1957; 308: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thrombin is a key enzyme in the blood coagulation cascade and a strong inducer of platelet aggregation. Three functional domains of thrombin have been described: an active site, a heparin-binding site, and a so-called anion-binding exosite mediating the binding to fibrinogen(4Fenton II, J.W. Olson T.A. Zabinski M.P. Wilner G.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7106-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the platelet receptor(5Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Charo I. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), and thrombomodulin(6Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The triatomine bug Rhodnius prolixus has been reported to contain a Kazal-type inhibitor which seems to be specifically directed to the active site of thrombin(7Friedrich T. Kröger B. Bialojan S. Lemaire H.G. Höffken H.W. Reuschenbach P. Otte M. Dodt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16216-16222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the related triatomine bug Triatoma pallidipennis, which also belongs to the family of Reduviidae or assassin bugs, and recently described the purification, cloning, and expression of a protein called pallidipin which specifically inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation(8Noeske-Jungblut C. Krätzschmar J. Haendler B. Alagon A. Possani L. Verhallen P. Donner P. Schleuning W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5050-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Now we have identified a thrombin inhibitor in the saliva of this insect and report its purification and characterization, and the cloning and expression of the corresponding cDNA. In contrast to the inhibitor from R. prolixus, the protein we isolated from T. pallidipennis and called triabin appears to be directed at the anion-binding exosite of thrombin. The saliva was obtained from T. pallidipennis bugs reared in captivity. Adult insects were hand stimulated to eject saliva which was collected in siliconized capillary tubes and lyophilized. The saliva was applied onto a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM CHAPS. ( 1The abbreviations used are: CHAPS3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidAPTTactivated partial thromboplastin time.) The fractions with inhibitory activity were pooled and loaded onto a thrombin-Sepharose 4B column prepared by coupling thrombin to CH-activated Sepharose as described by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). The column was washed with Tyrode's buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 3.3 mM Na2HPO4, 5.5 mM glucose, 3.8 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) followed by 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5. The inhibitor was eluted with 10 mM glycine, pH 2.5. The fractions were titrated to pH 7 and pooled. The purity of the preparation was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli(9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). 3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid activated partial thromboplastin time. 45 μg of triabin were incubated with 1 μg of Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) for 6 h at 37°C. The generated peptides were separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Superspher RP column (MZ-Analysentechnik) with a gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile. Selected peaks were subjected to amino acid sequencing. Triabin, modified with vinylpyridine(10Tarr G.E. Shively J.E. Methods of Protein Microcharacterization. Human Press, Clifton, NJ1986: 162-163Google Scholar), was subjected to automated Edman degradation in a gas-phase sequenator as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and native electrophoresis in the absence of detergent were performed according to Laemmli (9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) and Maurer(11Maurer H.R. DiscElektrophoresis. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1971: 44Google Scholar), respectively. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The method of Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) was used to determine protein concentration. 60 pmol of thrombin (Sigma) were preincubated either with 70 pmol of triabin or buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl) for 5 min at 37°C followed by the addition of 40 ng of trypsin. After 1 h incubation at 37°C the reaction was stopped with 0.5 μg of Pefabloc (E. Merck). The samples were boiled in sample buffer and electrophoresed according to Laemmli(9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen clotting activity was measured as described previously(13Church F.C. Phillips J.E. Woods J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11975-11979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This assay was used for the identification of active fractions during the purification procedure. Aggregation of washed platelets was measured as described earlier(8Noeske-Jungblut C. Krätzschmar J. Haendler B. Alagon A. Possani L. Verhallen P. Donner P. Schleuning W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5050-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, thrombin (human from Sigma, 1 nM) and triabin or hirudin preincubated for 1 min at 37°C were added to washed platelets and aggregation was monitored in an aggregometer (Micron). To assay amidolytic activity, 20 μl of thrombin (human from Sigma, 45 pM final concentration) were incubated with 80 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 100 μl of inhibitor or buffer for 2 min at 37°C in microtiter plates followed by the addition of 100 μl of H-D-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroaniline (S2238, Kabi Vitrum, 0.5 mM). The absorbance at 405 nm was recorded for 60 min in a microplate reader and the initial rate of p-nitroaniline liberation determined. For thrombin clotting time assays, 100 μl of thrombin (Behring, 3 IU/ml) and 100 μl of inhibitor or diethylbarbiturate acetate buffer (Behring) were incubated for 1 min at 37°C. After addition of 100 μl of plasma (control plasma N from Behring), the time until a clot formed was measured. The same method was used to determine reptilase activity but 200 μl of reptilase (Sigma, 5 μg/ml) was added instead of 100 μl of thrombin. To determine activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 100 μl of pooled citrated human plasma, 10 μl of inhibitor, and 100 μl of APTT reagent (Pathromtin, Behring, Germany) were incubated for 3 min at 37°C. After addition of 100 μl of prewarmed 25 mM CaCl2, the time until a clot formed was measured in a fibrometer (Sarstedt Biomatic B10). To measure factor Xa and trypsin activities, triabin was incubated with factor Xa (American Diagnostica Inc.) or with trypsin (Sigma) up to a molar ratio of 43:1 for 2 min at 37°C followed by the addition of N-benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroaniline (S2222, Kabi Vitrum, final concentration 0.167 mM). After 20 min at 37°C, the absorption at 405 nm was measured and compared to the control value without triabin. Protein C activation was measured in 96-well plates in an assay diluent (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1% NaN3, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mM CaCl2) as described previously(14Clarke J.H. Light D.R. Blasko E. Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. McLean K. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Morser J. Glaser C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6309-6315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triabin, thrombomodulin (35 ng/ml, kindly provided by Dr. John Morser, Berlex Biosciences), thrombin (Sigma, 0.44 units/ml), and protein C (Genzyme, 3 μM) were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was quenched with hirudin (American Diagnostica Inc., 0.16 units/ml) and 100 μl of D-Val-L-Leu-L-Arg-p-nitroaniline (S2266, Kabi Vitrum, 1 mM) were added. The absorption at 405 nm was recorded for 15 min in a microplate reader. A tag was first generated by polymerase chain reaction, using T. pallidipennis salivary gland cDNA (8Noeske-Jungblut C. Krätzschmar J. Haendler B. Alagon A. Possani L. Verhallen P. Donner P. Schleuning W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5050-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template. Sense (5′-GCNGARGGNGAYGAYTGYTCNCTNGARAARGCN-3′) and antisense (5′-TTRTTRTANCCRATYTCNACRATYTGNGTRAA-3′) primers deduced from the NH2-terminal and an internal region of triabin were used in 40 cycles of 2 min denaturation at 94°C, 1 min 30 s annealing at 52°C, and 2 min elongation at 72°C. The amplified 200-base pair long fragment was subcloned and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method(15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A screening probe was derived from it using the Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer) in 5 cycles of 2 min 30 s at 94°C, 2 min at 40°C, and 3 min 30 s at 72°C, in the presence of labeled dCTP (Amersham) and using the antisense primer. A T. pallidipennis cDNA library (8Noeske-Jungblut C. Krätzschmar J. Haendler B. Alagon A. Possani L. Verhallen P. Donner P. Schleuning W.-D. J. Biol.

Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and positive clones were analyzed after in vivo excision. The complete DNA sequence of both insert strands was determined for the selected cDNAs. The construction of the pKK/cph expression vector, which is derived from pKK233-2 into which a sequence derived from the signal peptide coding part of secreted bacterial cyclophilin (17Hayano T. Takahashi N. Kato S. Maki N. Suzuki M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was introduced, has been described(18Haendler B. Becker A. Noeske-Jungblut C. Krätzschmar J. Donner P. Schleuning W.-D. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The region coding for mature triabin (clone Tr28) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (10 cycles of 2 min at 94°C, 2 min at 53°C, and 2 min 30 s at 72°C) while introducing new flanking NheI and HindIII sites, using appropriate primers (5′-GCGATAGCTAGCAGAAGGTGACGAC-3′; 5′-GCGATAGGATCCAAGCTTACTAACAAATTTCATTAGCATCAGG-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into pKK/cph, downstream of the cyclophilin signal peptide coding region and the resulting construct checked by DNA sequencing. Transformation was into Escherichia coli JM105 and induction was carried out on a bacterial culture grown to an A600 of 0.6 by adding 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and shaking for 6 h at 37°C. The bacteria were centrifuged, resuspended in one-tenth volume of 0.5 M saccharose, and equilibrated for 10 min at room temperature. They were then centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold water and left for 10 min on ice. Following the osmotic shock, the cells were centrifuged and the supernatant which corresponds to the periplasmic fraction was recovered. The periplasmic fraction was first loaded on a DE-52 cellulose column for ion-exchange chromatography. The column was equilibrated and washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.075 M NaCl and the elution carried out in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with a 0.6 M and a 1 M NaCl step. Active fractions were further purified by affinity chromatography on a thrombin-Sepharose column as described above. The concentration of the fibrinogen stock solution and the triabin solution were calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm using A1%280 = 15.1 (19Higgins D.L. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9276-9282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ϵ= 12,450 M-1 cm-1. For the determination of the Km, 1.5-40 μM fibrinogen were incubated with 75 pM thrombin in 50 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 6000. To measure the Ki, 25-200 pM triabin were incubated with 75 pM thrombin and the reaction was started with 10 μM fibrinogen. In both studies aliquots were taken after 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 4 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of H-D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone (Bachem, final concentration 170 μM) followed by heating at 56°C for 5 min. The amount of fibrinopeptide A released was measured in a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as stated by the manufacturer (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp.). Briefly, fibrinogen was removed after precipitation with ethanol. The supernatants or standards (52-829 nM) were incubated with peroxidase-labeled antibodies (8C2-5) against fibrinopeptide A and applied to a microtiter plate coated with antigen. After 30 min incubation, peroxidase activity was determined using o-phenylenediamine/H2O2 as substrate. The velocities of fibrinogen cleavage were determined from the gradient of fibrinopeptide A concentration between 0 and 4 min. The Km was determined by nonlinear regression analysis of velocity versus substrate concentration according to Duggleby (20Duggleby R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) using the computer program k•cat (Europa Scientific Software Corp.). The Ki was graphically determined by the method of Dixon(21Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The saliva of T. pallidipennis was found to inhibit not only platelet aggregation induced by collagen but also aggregation mediated by thrombin. These two inhibitory activities were separated by gel filtration although the two proteins have similar molecular masses. This was achieved by using a Superose 12 column with a buffer containing only low salt concentrations which led to a retardation of pallidipin but not of the thrombin inhibitor. The thrombin inhibitor was further purified by affinity chromatography on thrombin Sepharose. 11 μg of purified inhibitor, which we named triabin, were recovered from 10 mg of dried saliva. The purity of this preparation was ascertained by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, which showed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa under reducing conditions and 18 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). In order to investigate the triabin-thrombin complex, we incubated triabin with thrombin at different molar ratios and analyzed the probes by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1, the inhibitor was totally bound in a complex with thrombin when the molar ratio of triabin to thrombin was 1:1, whereas free triabin was detected at a ratio of 1.5:1 (lanes 3 and 4). This complex was not covalently linked since it could be separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (lane 6). Triabin inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2). If platelet aggregation was induced by 1 nM thrombin, total inhibition was observed at 1 nM triabin. The dose-response curve was almost identical to that of hirudin. In contrast, the COOH-terminal tail of hirudin, hir(54-65), also called hirugen, exhibited a nearly 500 times lower activity (Fig. 2). No effect of triabin was noted on the aggregation induced by collagen or ADP (not shown). Triabin inhibited not only platelet aggregation but also interfered with the other known activities of thrombin. A 4-fold prolongation of thrombin-clotting time was measured with 22 nM triabin (Fig. 3). Clotting of plasma can also be catalyzed by reptilase, an enzyme from the snake venom of Bothrops atrox(22Holleman W.H. Weiss L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1663-1669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triabin did not inhibit this enzyme (data not shown). Activated partial thromboplastin time was prolonged 4-fold by about 600 nM triabin and about 400 nM hirudin. While hirudin already showed an effect at 10 nM, triabin was only active at concentrations higher than 500 nM (Fig. 3). In contrast to its strong inhibitory effect in the assays described above, triabin hardly affected thrombin activity in an amidolytic assay using a synthetic peptide substrate (Fig. 4). Only a 35% inhibition was achieved with a 3-fold molar excess of triabin. Higher concentrations up to a 67-fold molar excess did not lead to an increase of this inhibitory effect. This is in contrast to hirudin, which totally blocked the amidolytic activity of thrombin at low concentrations (Fig. 4). Other serine proteases, e.g. trypsin and factor Xa, were not inhibited in an amidolytic assay even when using a 45-fold molar excess of triabin (data not shown).Figure 3Inhibition of thrombin clotting time and APTT. Thrombin preincubated with triabin for 1 min was added to human plasma and the time until a clot formed was measured (triangles). Human plasma, APTT reagent and triabin (solid circles), or hirudin (open circles) were preincubated before starting the reaction with CaCl2 and measuring the APTT.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Effect of triabin and hirudin on the amidolytic activity of thrombin. Thrombin (45 pM) was preincubated with triabin (solid circles) or hirudin (open circles) for 1 min before adding S2238. The absorbance at 405 nm was monitored. Data are presented as the percent of thrombin amidolytic activity without inhibitors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These results demonstrate that triabin is specific for thrombin. The difference in its inhibitory activity using either fibrinogen or a small synthetic peptide as substrate indicates that it may exert its inhibitory effect by binding to the anion-binding exosite rather than to the catalytic site of thrombin. Limited trypsin proteolysis converts α-thrombin into β-thrombin through cleavage of the Arg73-Asn74 bond within the anion-binding exosite(23Braun P.J. Hofsteenge J. Chang J.-Y. Stone S.R. Thromb. Res. 1988; 50: 273-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Preincubation of thrombin with triabin prevented the cleavage by trypsin as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Since triabin did not inhibit trypsin, the effect was probably achieved by binding of triabin to the exosite of thrombin. Thrombomodulin is known to exhibit its effect on thrombin by binding to the anion-binding exosite(6Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The resulting change of substrate specificity enables thrombin to activate protein C. This activity can be tested by incubating thrombomodulin and thrombin with the inactive preform of protein C. This leads to activation of protein C which is detectable by its amidolytic activity. Triabin neither showed a thrombomodulin-like activity, i.e. it did not modulate thrombin, nor did it activate protein C. However, it was able to antagonize the effect of thrombomodulin in the protein C activation assay in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). This observation further corroborates our hypothesis that triabin binds to this exosite of thrombin. Twenty amino-terminal amino acids of triabin were sequenced and additional internal sequences were determined after cleavage with endoproteinase Lys-C and separation of the fragments by high performance liquid chromatography. Degenerate primers were made based on the protein sequence information and used to amplify a specific tag from T. pallidipennis salivary gland first-strand cDNA. The probe was employed to screen approximately 1 × 106 primary phage clones from a T. pallidipennis salivary gland cDNA library. DNA sequencing revealed that four different types of triabin cDNA had been isolated (Tr5, Tr12, Tr28, and Tr45). The clone with the longest insert is depicted in Fig. 6. It exhibited an open reading frame potentially coding for a 160-amino acid long protein. Hydrophilicity analysis showed that the 18 NH2-terminal residues displayed the hallmarks characteristic of a signal peptide(24Von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The following position was occupied by the alanine residue representing the NH2 terminus of triabin isolated from T. pallidipennis saliva. Mature triabin is therefore a 142-amino acid long protein with a predicted relative molecular mass of 15,948, slightly less than that of the saliva protein which is probably glycosylated. Indeed a potential N-glycosylation site was detected in the deduced amino acid sequence. The stretches previously determined by protein sequencing were retrieved in the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA but two discrepancies were noted at positions 8 and 77 where leucine and aspartic acid found in the protein were replaced by isoleucine and glycine, respectively. The untranslated region downstream of the open reading frame contained a sequence almost exactly matching a polyadenylation signal (25Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar) in the appropriate position upstream of a poly(A) tail. In addition to Tr5, cDNAs coding for three variant forms of triabin were also isolated. The deduced mature proteins had the same length but differed slightly in their sequence. The degree of conservation was, however, very high since there was over 94% amino acid sequence identity between the mature forms. In total, there were only 9 positions where all four proteins were not identical and in four of these positions the amino acid exchange was conservative (Tr12: 8L, 77D, 86G, 114I, 127F, and 139N; Tr28: 8L 32D, 77D, 86G, 114I, 127F and 139N; Tr45: 8L, 32D, 72A, 74K, 77D, 86G, 127F, and 139N). It can therefore be assumed that the biological function of the variants is identical. Unlike the product of Tr5, the three additional forms exactly matched the partial sequences directly determined on the natural salivary protein. A search in the SwissProt data base did not reveal any significant homology between triabin and other known proteins (the best score was 19% identity for an 83-amino acid long overlap). A periplasmic expression construct based on the pKK233 plasmid and harboring the isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-inducible trc promoter was devised. The coding sequence of mature triabin was fused to the signal peptide coding part of secreted bacterial cyclophilin, modified so as to optimize the leader peptidase cutting site(18Haendler B. Becker A. Noeske-Jungblut C. Krätzschmar J. Donner P. Schleuning W.-D. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Dalbey R.E. Von Heijne G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 474-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The Tr28 cDNA was selected for these studies because the protein it encoded showed no difference to the protein sequence data and most closely corresponded to a consensus triabin sequence inferred from the four variants. The periplasmic fraction of transformed E. coli was prepared. The fibrinogen clotting test indicated the presence of an inhibitory activity in this fraction, which was not observed with mock-transformed bacteria. Recombinant triabin was purified using a two-step procedure involving a separation on DE-52 cellulose and affinity chromatography on a thrombin-Sepharose column. The purity of the protein was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of about 18 kDa, comparable to that of saliva triabin was observed (not shown). The identity was further checked by determination of the NH2-terminal sequence and the protein was found to start with the expected alanine residue, indicating that correct processing had taken place. The biological activity was evaluated in a platelet aggregation assay (Fig. 2). A dose-response study showed that recombinant triabin inhibited aggregation induced by 1 nM thrombin in a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 being 0.82 nM. A kinetic analysis of thrombin-catalyzed fibrinogen cleavage was performed by measuring fibrinopeptide A release, and the Km was found to be 14.0 ± 3.7 μM. The inhibitory effect of recombinant triabin was assessed in this test, and the Ki measured. Since in this analysis, the amount of inhibitor bound by the enzyme was no longer negligible, the graphical method of Dixon (21Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) was used as it avoids the assumption that the total concentration of inhibitor is equal to the theoretically required free concentration and is therefore also applicable for tight-binding inhibitors. The Ki was found to be 3 pM (Fig. 7). Blood-sucking insects employ various mechanisms to interfere with the blood coagulation of their host species. The saliva of T. pallidipennis inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation by pallidipin (8Noeske-Jungblut C. Krätzschmar J. Haendler B. Alagon A. Possani L. Verhallen P. Donner P. Schleuning W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5050-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ADP-mediated aggregation by an apyrase. ( 2C. Noeske-Jungblut, unpublished results.) Now we report a third anticoagulatory mechanism, thrombin inhibition by a protein which we named triabin. Triabin forms a complex with thrombin, probably in a molar ratio of 1:1. This complex is noncovalent, hence it is formed via a mechanism different from the physiological heparin-antithrombin III-thrombin interaction. Other inhibitors from hematophageous animals also form noncovalent complexes with thrombin but they differ in their mechanism of action. Hirudin binds to the active site and with its COOH-terminal tail to the anion-binding exosite(27Fenton II, J.W. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1989; 15: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas rhodniin seems to affect mainly the active site(7Friedrich T. Kröger B. Bialojan S. Lemaire H.G. Höffken H.W. Reuschenbach P. Otte M. Dodt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16216-16222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bothrojaracin, isolated from the venom of Bothrops jararaca(28Zingali R.B. Jandrot-Perrus M. Guillin M.-C. Bon C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10794-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), exhibits its inhibitory effect exclusively via binding to the anion-binding site. All these inhibitors interfere with thrombin's activity on fibrinogen and on the platelet receptor. Whereas triabin has the same high inhibitory activity as hirudin, it is about 500 times more potent than hirugen, the COOH-terminal tail of hirudin. Compared to bothrojaracin(28Zingali R.B. Jandrot-Perrus M. Guillin M.-C. Bon C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10794-10802Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the IC50 values for inhibition of platelet activation are 7 times lower for triabin. In contrast to the active site inhibitors, proteins specific for the anion-binding exosite should not affect the cleavage of chromogenic peptide substrates, which only interact with the active site. Indeed, bothrojaracin and hirugen do not decrease the amidolytic activity of thrombin. However, triabin partially suppresses this activity. Since this effect is low compared to its inhibitory activity on fibrinogen clotting and platelet aggregation, it is conceivable that it binds only to the anion-binding exosite. One explanation for the only partial inhibition of amidolytic activity may be that triabin sterically hinders the access of small peptides to the active site. Another possibility is that the binding of triabin to thrombin changes the conformation of the enzyme, resulting in lower activity. Proteolysis of thrombin within the anion-binding exosite also causes an inhibition of fibrinogen cleavage and a small decrease of the affinity to peptide substrates(6Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hofsteenge et al.(6Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggested that the proteolysis leads to a small conformational change in the thrombin molecule which affects the peptide-binding residues. Limited proteolysis of α-thrombin by trypsin results in the cleavage of the Arg73-Asn74 bond, which is located in the anion-binding exosite, and generates β-thrombin(23Braun P.J. Hofsteenge J. Chang J.-Y. Stone S.R. Thromb. Res. 1988; 50: 273-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Triabin was able to protect this site against cleavage by trypsin. Since a direct inhibition of trypsin was excluded, it is probably the binding of triabin to this site which is responsible for this effect. Similar experiments were performed with hirudin and its COOH-terminal fragment, which likewise inhibited the cleavage(29Dennis S. Wallace A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and x-ray diffraction analysis showed that indeed these peptides bind to the anion-binding exosite(30Rydel T.J. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. Roitsch C. Fenton II, J.W. Science. 1990; 249: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). These results lend additional support to our hypothesis that triabin binds to thrombin in a similar manner. Binding of thrombomodulin to thrombin causes a change in the specificity of the protease. Hofsteenge et al.(31Hofsteenge J. Taguchi H. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) demonstrated that thrombomodulin inhibits the binding of fibrinogen to thrombin but hardly affects the binding of peptide substrates. Cleaving α-thrombin at the Arg73-Asn74 bond reduces its affinity to thrombomodulin(6Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additionally, an antibody binding to residues 62-73 of thrombin inhibits the activation of protein C by α-thrombin in the presence of thrombomodulin(6Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the region around Arg73, the anion-binding exosite, is necessary for the interaction with thrombomodulin. Therefore, it was of interest to investigate the effect of triabin on this interaction as well. Indeed, triabin inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the thrombomodulin-mediated activation of protein C by thrombin. This result further corroborates the hypothesis that triabin binds to the anion-binding exosite. Four different cDNA clones with minor polymorphisms that probably do not affect the biological function of triabin were isolated. This diversity might reflect the existence either of a protein family or more likely of a genetic heterogeneity among the insects from which the salivary glands were collected. No sequence homology was found between triabin and the thrombin inhibitors hirudin and rhodniin. This is in keeping with the different modes of action of these proteins. A vector for periplasmic expression was used for the production of triabin, in order to favor correct folding of the protein and facilitate the subsequent purification. Our results show that in both the fibrinogen clotting test and the thrombin-induced platelet aggregation assay, the biological activity of recombinant triabin purified from the periplasm of E. coli was similar to that of saliva triabin, suggesting that the protein has assumed its natural configuration. The inhibition constant of 3 pM, which was measured in the thrombin-catalyzed fibrinogen cleavage assay, indicates a very tight binding of triabin to thrombin. For the hirudin-thrombin complex, dissociation constants of 63 pM(32Markwardt F. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 924-932Crossref Scopus (303) Google Scholar), 3 pM(33Dodt J. Köhler S. Baici A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and 20 fM(34Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) have been cited in the literature. All these values were determined with an amidolytic substrate which could not be used for this study because triabin does not seem to block the active site. However, the value for triabin agrees well with the Ki found by Dodt et al.(33Dodt J. Köhler S. Baici A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, the COOH-terminal hirudin peptide Hir53-64, which, like triabin, recognizes the anion-binding site of thrombin, has been shown to be less active in the thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of fibrinogen, the Ki being 144 nM(35Maraganore J.M. Bourdon P. Jablonski J. Ramachandran K.L. Fenton II, J.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7095-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In summary, we have purified a thrombin inhibitor with a potency comparable to hirudin but with a different mode of action. The availability of recombinant triabin will now allow us to further explore its mechanism of action and carry out structure-function studies using site-directed mutagenesis in order to identify the structural elements involved. X-ray diffraction analysis should provide detailed information on the structure of the triabin-thrombin complex. Furthermore, in vivo models will be tested to assess the effectiveness of triabin as an antithrombotic. We are indebted to J. Milde, L. Dummann, and C. Schlegel for excellent technical assistance, and to D. Sauvageot for oligodeoxynucleotide synthesis. The participation of Dr. U. Hechler and S. Gruner in the early phases of the project is acknowledged. We thank Dr. J.

https://openalex.org/W2086009543,"Three different molecular masses (24, 22, and 20 kDa) of antioxidant proteins were purified in Escherichia coli. These proteins exhibited the preventive effects against the inactivation of glutamine synthetase activity and the cleavage of DNA by a metal-catalyzed oxidation system capable of generating reactive oxygen species. Their antioxidant activities were supported by a thiol-reducing equivalent such as dithiothreitol. Analysis of the amino-terminal amino acid sequences and the immunoblots between 24- and 22-kDa proteins indicates that the 24-kDa protein is an intact form of the 22-kDa protein that was previously identified 22-kDa subunit (AhpC) of E. coli alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC/AhpF). We isolated and sequenced an E. coli genomic DNA fragment that encodes 20-kDa protein. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the 20-kDa protein with that of AhpC revealed no sequence homology. A search of a data bank showed that the 20-kDa protein is a new type of antioxidant enzyme. The synthesis of this novel 20-kDa protein was increased in response to oxygen stress during growth. The 20-kDa protein resides mainly in the periplasmic space of E. coli, whereas the 24-kDa AhpC resides mainly in the matrix. The 20-kDa protein was functionally linked to the thioredoxin as an in vivo thiol-regenerating system and exerted a peroxidase activity. This 20-kDa protein is thus named “thiol peroxidase,” which could act as an antioxidant enzyme removing peroxides or H2O2 within the catalase- and peroxidase-deficient periplasmic space of E. coli.

In an aerobic environment, reactive oxygen species (O2, H2O2, ROOH, and HO·) are generated by many physiological processes such as incomplete reduction of molecular oxygen during respiration, NADPH oxidation linked to respiratory burst during phagocytosis, and redox cycling of xenobiotics(1Halliwell B. Gutterridge J.M.C. Free Radical in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). To prevent the deleterious effect of oxygen species, cells have equipped with a number of antioxidant enzymes, including catalases, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutase. Recently, a 25-kDa antioxidant enzyme was purified from various eukaryotes, including yeast(2Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Thus, this enzyme has been named “TSA” (“thiol-specific antioxidant protein”). Previously, we have reported that the yeast TSA has a capability to destroy H2O2 in the presence of DTT (5Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Uhm T.B. Park J.W. Kim K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and such a peroxidase activity was greatly enhanced by the in vivo thiol-regenerating system (thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase-NADPH)(6Kwon S.J. Park J.W. Choi W.K. Kim I.H. Kim K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, its physiological significance as a peroxidase is still debatable because of the existence of conventional catalases and peroxidases in eukaryotic cytoplasm. Yeast and human genes that encode the 25-kDa TSA have been cloned and sequenced(7Chae H.J. Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences showed no homology to known antioxidant enzymes(8Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Biofactors. 1994; 4: 177-180PubMed Google Scholar). An analysis of data bases revealed 27 additional protein sequences showing homology to the 25-kDa TSA. The biochemical functions of these homologous proteins (TSA family) are not yet clarified except for AhpC, one subunit of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase found in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli(10Jacobson F.S. Morgan R. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alignment of amino acid sequences of TSA family revealed two highly conserved cysteine residues. The yeast TSA whose conserved cysteines were replaced with serines completely lost antioxidant activity, which indicates that these cysteine residues are essential for the activity(11Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7026-7072Google Scholar, 12Chae H.Z. Robinson K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Thus, the TSA/AhpC family has been suggested to be a new type of peroxidase containing functional cysteines(6Kwon S.J. Park J.W.

During aerobic growth, E. coli can be exposed to endogenous and exogenous reactive oxygen species from various oxidation reactions. These reactive oxygen species are known to damage cellular constituents. Alkyl hydroperoxides among many products of oxygen radical damage have a capability to initiate and propagate free radical chain reactions leading to DNA and membrane damages(13Mead J.F. Free Radicals in Biology. 1. Academic Press, New York1976: 51-68Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, glutathione peroxidases catalyze the reduction of alkyl hydroperoxides to the corresponding alcohols and H2O. However, there has been no evidence that glutathione peroxidase exists in prokaryotes. A peroxidase was identified in both Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli(10Jacobson F.S. Morgan R. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified activity required two separable subunits, 22- and 57-kDa proteins. The 57-kDa AhpF-linked and 22-kDa AhpC proteins converts alkyl hydroperoxides to the corresponding alcohols. This enzyme (AhpF/AhpC), hence, was suggested to serve as a prokaryotic equivalent to the glutathione reductase/glutathione peroxidase system in eukaryotes. From E. coli, we purified three proteins (20, 22, and 24 kDa) showing thiol-dependent antioxidant activities. The 20-kDa antioxidant enzyme among the three proteins was shown to be a novel antioxidant enzyme, which resided in the periplasmic space of E. coli. In this paper we reported the purification and characterization of a novel E. coli 20-kDa antioxidant protein showing peroxidase activity and discussed its physiological function in the periplasmic space on the basis of thioredoxin (Trx)-linked “thiol peroxidase.” A stock solution of FeCl3 was prepared in 0.1 N HCl. Glutamine synthetase was purified from the E. coli (Pgln/YMC10) as described (14Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 213-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two protein components, thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, also were purified from wild type E. coli K12 according to the methods reported previously(6Kwon S.J. Park J.W. Choi W.K. Kim I.H. Kim K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Wild type E. coli K12 were grown in 50 liters of LB medium. The harvested cells by centrifugation were resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following freezing-and-thawing and sonication (50% power) eight times for 3-min intervals interspersed with periods of cooling on ice bath, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was brought to 1% of streptomycin sulfate by slow addition of 10% solution. After 30 min on ice, the nucleic acid precipitate was removed. The supernatant was then treated with ammonium sulfate to a concentration of 70% to precipitate proteins. The precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The dialyzed solution was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (5 × 30 cm) previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The thiol-dependent antioxidant enzymes were eluted by a linear gradient (0-400 mM KCl) in a total volume of 1 liter of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The active fractions were pooled, and the proteins were precipitated with 70% ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4, and was applied to a Sephadex G-75 column. All of the fractions revealed the antioxidant activity, but yielded two peaks, I and II (not shown). Each ammonium sulfate precipitates of the peaks I and II was dissolved in 100 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4), containing 1.0 M ammonium sulfate, and applied to the respective phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (2.5 × 20 cm) previously equilibrated with 100 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1.0 M ammonium sulfate. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 1.0 M ammonium sulfate to the buffer containing no salt and then eluted by cold deionized and distilled water. A strong thiol-dependent antioxidant activity was eluted by deionized and distilled water in the case of the phenyl column for Sephadex G-75 peak II fractions. A major thiol-dependent activity was eluted at the concentrations of 0.5-0.25 M ammonium sulfate in the case of the phenyl column for Sephadex G-75 peak I fractions. The active fractions from two phenyl columns were separately concentrated with Centricon 10 (Amicon). Each concentrated sample was applied to an additional Sephadex G-75 (for 20-kDa protein) or G-100 column (for 22-kDa protein). A 22-kDa protein showing the antioxidant activity was homogeneously obtained from the front part of protein peak of Sephadex G-100 column loaded by the phenyl fraction of Sephadex G-75 peak I. The thiol-dependent activity appeared in a shoulder just after the major protein peaks of Sephadex G-75 column for the phenyl fraction of Sephadex G-75 peak II. The concentrated sample of the active fractions was applied to a Sephadex G-50 column for the further purification. The active fractions were concentrated and washed with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.6). The resulting sample was applied to a Accell-QMA column and eluted with a linear KCl gradient from 0 to 1.0 M, which gave a 20-kDa of homogeneous thiol-dependent antioxidant protein at a concentration of 0.4-0.6 M. The activities of E. coli antioxidant enzymes were assayed by monitoring their thiol-dependent antioxidant activity as described below. Thiol-dependent antioxidant activities of E. coli antioxidant enzymes were determined by monitoring their activities to inhibit the inactivation of E. coli glutamine synthetase by a metal-catalyzed thiol system (DTT, Fe3+, O2) (thiol MCO system) (15Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Kim et al.(2Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of DTT, ascorbate was included as a non-thiol-reducing equivalent (non-thiol MCO system). Fifty μl of reaction mixture containing 5 μg of glutamine synthetase, 3 μM FeCl3, 10 mM DTT, or 10 mM ascorbate, antioxidant enzyme, and 100 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0) was incubated at 37°C. The remaining activity of glutamine synthetase was measured by addition of 10 μl of the reaction mixture to 2 ml of γ-glutamyltransferase assay mixture as described(2Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the antioxidant activity linked to Trx, the remaining glutamine synthetase activity was monitored in the reaction mixture containing 5 μg of glutamine synthetase, 3 μM FeCl3, 10 mM ascorbate, antioxidant enzyme, varying concentration of NADPH from 1 to 4 mM, 50 μg/ml E. coli Trx, 50 μg/ml E. coli thioredoxin reductase, and 100 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0). To determine the peroxidase activity of the enzymes, the reaction was started by the addition of 1 mM H2O2 into the 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 2 mM NADPH, 12.5 μg/ml of E. coli Trx, 12.5 μg/ml of E. coli thioredoxin reductase, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, and then incubated at 37°C. At appropriate reaction time, 10 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 0.8 ml of trichloroacetic acid solution (12.5%, w/v) to stop the reaction, followed by the addition of 0.2 ml of 10 mM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 0.1 ml of 2.5 N KSCN to develop the complex, giving a purple color. The concentration of H2O2 was monitored by measurement of the decrease in absorbance at 480 nm, the absorbance maximum of the purple-colored complex. To determine peroxidase activity of E. coli antioxidant enzyme linked to NADPH oxidation, the reaction was started by the addition of various amounts of the antioxidant enzyme to 50 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), containing 0.1 mM NADPH, varying concentrations of H2O2, 12.5 μg/ml TrX, and 12.5 μg/ml thioredoxin reductase. The resulting oxidation of NADPH was directly followed by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. After reaction mixture (100 mM Hepes (pH 7.0)) containing the thiol-MFO system (3 μM FeCl3, 10 mM DTT) was incubated with or without the enzyme for 40 min at 37°C, two μg of pUC 19 plasmid was added for additional 4-h incubation(4Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The resulting reaction mixture was subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction to obtain DNA, then applied to 1% agarose gel to examine its cleavage. Cells (10 g) were washed three times with 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4), containing 30 mM NaCl, and were then osmotically shocked by incubation in 500 ml of 20% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 30 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4 for 5 min and then transferred to 500 ml of cold deionized water. Proteins of the periplasmic space were released into solution by such treatments, whereas proteins of the cytoplasm were retained(16Heppel L.A. Science. 1967; 156: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Catalase activity was determined by direct measurement of the decrease of absorbance at 250 nm caused by the decomposition of H2O2 by catalase(17Chance B. Maehly A.C. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 764-775Crossref Scopus (3418) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase activity to scavenge O2 was measured according the method by Crapo et al.(18Crapo J.D. McCord J.M. Fridovich I. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The rate of production of GSSG by glutathione peroxidase was measured in the presence of excess glutathione reductase by following the rate of NADPH oxidation(19Tappel A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 506-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Trx activity was determined by measurement of the decrease of absorbance at 412 nm resulting from the reduction of DTNB. The purified 20-kDa protein was reductively denaturated by 6 M guanidine hydrochrolide solution containing 1 mM DTT and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). The sulfhydryl group(s) was labeled with TNB by 10 mM DTNB for 1 h at 37°C(20Sliwkowski M.X. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The TNB-linked protein was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitate was washed three times with acetone. The resulting protein was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and after the digestion with 20 μg of trypsin for 3 h at 37°C, the additional digestion with another 20 μg of trypsin was carried out overnight at 30°C. The resulting peptides were applied to a preparative Vydac C18 column (25 × 250 mm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 60 min at a 2 ml/min of flow rate. Peptides containing cysteine residues were detected by monitoring at 328 nm. An E. coli K12 genomic DNA library in λgt11 (Clonetech Laboratory, Inc,) was screened with rabbit polyclonal antibodies prepared against purified 20-kDa protein. The sequence determination was done by the dideoxy chain-termination method(21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses of E. coli thiol antioxidant enzymes (24, 22, and 20-kDa enzymes) were performed by using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against corresponding enzymes. Procedures for transfer of proteins from 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose and for the processing of nitrocellulose blots have been described previously(4Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Monospecific antibodies for the 20-kDa protein were prepared from the γ-globulin fraction using the 20-kDa protein immobilized on nitrocellulose strips as described previously (4Kim I.H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6018-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit based on the method of Bradford(22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli(23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Detection of dimer form of thiol antioxidant enzyme was carried out on 12% nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The native molecular mass of protein was estimated from a graph of the logarithm of the molecular mass as a function of elution volume (Ve/V0) made using the data from the protein standards such as egg albumin (45 kDa), bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), and horse heart cytochrome C (12.4 kDa). Elution volume (Ve) was the volume eluted from the Sephacryl S-200 column (1.5 × 75 cm) at a 0.1 ml/min of flow rate. The 100 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM KCl was used as the elution buffer. The void volume (V0) of the column was measured using size-graded blue dextran (2,000-kDa). We purified three different molecular masses of thiol-dependent antioxidant proteins from the whole extract of E. coli. The molecular masses of these proteins were determined to be 20, 22 (shown on Fig. 1, A and B) and 24 kDa (shown on Fig. 1A) on reducing SDS-PAGE (12%) with β-mercaptoethanol. To simplify the nomenclature, the 20-, 22- and 24-kDa proteins will be subsequently designated as p20, p22, and p24, respectively. The G-75 gel permeation chromatography yielded two peaks showing thiol-dependent antioxidant activity, peaks I and II (not shown). From the later peak II, p20 was purified to homogeneity by four sequential chromatographic steps on phenyl, G-75, G-50, and Accell-QMA (Waters) chromatographies. From the peak I, p22 was homogeneously obtained from two additional purification steps using phenyl column and G-75 columns (Fig. 1A). In the nonreducing gel without β-mercaptoethanol, p22 was detected at the molecular size corresponding to the dimer form, suggesting an intermolecular disulfide bond (lanes 1 and 5 in Fig. 1B), whereas p20 at the molecular size of the monomer (lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 1B). From the immunoblot of the crude extract of E. coli with the p22-specific polyclonal antibodies, p24 was detected as a unique band (not shown). The immunoblot analysis of each purification step showed that during further purifications the p24 band disappeared, whereas the p22 band appeared. To conform p24 as a native form of p22, we tried to purify p24. From the ammonium sulfate fractions (30-60%) of the crude extract, the p24 was purified to homogeneity by three sequential chromatographic steps on Sephadex G-75, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, and Sephacryl S-200 HR chromatographies. The reducing SDS-PAGE analysis for leading fractions of the S-200 showed that the p24 is approximately near to the upper exclusion limit of S-200 (250-kDa). This suggests that p24 may exist as an aggregated form. Such an aggregated property was also reported in the case of 25-kDa TSA from yeast(2Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to p24, the elution profile of p20 from the S-200 column indicates that p20 exists in the monomer form having molecular mass of 20 kDa. The native molecular mass of p20 was estimated to be 16.8 kDa on the comparison of the elution volume of p20 from Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography with those of protein standards (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequences of the amino-terminal residues were determined to be as follows: SQTVHFQGNPVTVANSIPQAG (p20) and SLINTKIKPFKNQAFKNGEF (p22 and p24). The same sequence of p22 as that of p24 suggests that p22 could be a fragmented form of p24. A search of the GeneBank(TM) data base revealed that the amino-terminal sequence of p24 or p22 is exactly same as that of AhpC. The molecular mass of AhpC was previously estimated to be 22 kDa(10Jacobson F.S. Morgan R. Christman M.F. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1488-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A search of the Swiss-Prot data bank showed that the amino-terminal sequence of p20 is exactly same as the amino-terminal 18 residues of an unknown E. coli protein from two-dimensional PAGE. ( 2C. Pasquali(1994) accession number P37901.) They reported that on the two-dimensional gel the determined pI of this unknown protein is 5.0, and its molecular mass is 20 kDa. Four peptides containing cysteine residues were identified by monitoring elution at 328 nm (not shown). Their retention times were 54.923 (C1), 62.001 (C2), 69.285 (C3), and 77.187 min (C4). The amino acid sequences of the well isolated three peptides (C1, C3, and C4) among the four TNB-conjugated peptides (C1-C4) were shown on Fig. 2. The gene encoding p20 was cloned as a 2.2-kilobase fragment and was sequnced. An open reading frame was identified and found to encode a polypeptide of 167 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 17,764 daltons (Fig. 2). The amino acid sequence of p20 contains two cysteine residues. The amino acid sequence of p20 does not shows a significant similarity to those of TSA/AhpC family and conventional antioxidant enzymes. The number of cysteines in p20 was also determined by the DTNB titration method after the protein was reduced with 1 mM DTT in the presence of 6 M guanidine chloride. Approximately two sulfhydryl groups per 20-kDa polypeptide were detected. It has been reported that two cysteines exist in the TSA/AhpC family proteins. The amino acid sequences of the regions containing the cysteines (VCP1: FTFVCPTE and VCP2: GEVCPA) are perfectly conserved(8Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Chae H.Z. Robinson K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the region containing two cysteines in p20 shows no significant homology to any amino acid sequence of the VCP1 and VCP2 domains. Thus, this result suggests that p20 could not be a member of the TSA/AhpC family. Fig. 3 shows the time-dependent inactivation of glutamine synthetase and thiol-dependent antioxidant activities of p20 and AhpC. Inactivation of yeast glutamine synthetase by DTT and Fe3+(2Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was completely prevented by p20 (curve 2 in Fig. 3A) or AhpC (curve 2 in Fig. 3B). When thiol-reducing equivalent (DTT) is replaced with non-thiol-reducing equivalent (ascorbate), this thiol-dependent proteins no longer protect against the inactivation of glutamine synthetase by Fe3+-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) system (curve 3 in Fig. 3, A and B). The extent of glutamine synthetase protection increased showing saturation curve as the concentration of p20 or AhpC was increased (not shown). Previously we have reported that the supercoiled form of plasmid DNA was nicked by thiol MCO system (5Lim Y.S. Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Uhm T.B. Park J.W. Kim K. Kim I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) capable of generating reactive oxygen species(24Claycamp H.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Fifty nM p20 or AhpC was required to preserve completely glutamine synthetase activity. However, p20 showed the higher extent of protection degree than AhpC at the less than concentrations of 50 nM (not shown). The more effective protection by p20 against DNA cleavage confirms the superior capability of p20 to AhpC for antioxidant enzyme. At a concentration of protein (A280 = 0.98), any detectable absorption peaks was not observed in the range of 320-700 nm (not shown), indicating that p20 does not contain prosthetic groups such as heme and flavin and, therefore, is not a sort of catalases or reductases. p20 was examined for superoxide dismutase activity. Ten μg of p20 did not decrease the rate of ferricytochrome c reduction (see “Experimental Procedures”), indicating that p20 does not have activity to destroy the superoxide anion. p20 was examined for glutathione peroxidase under the assay conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” because p20 was the required thiol-reducing equivalent such as DTT to maintain its antioxidant activity. Ten μg of p20 did not cause significant oxidation of NADPH. Two mg of p20 (100 nmol) was applied to a double beam atomic adsorption spectrophotometer (GBC 902) for the determination of selenocysteine in p20. However, a significant amount of selenium was not detected (not shown). These results indicate that p20 is not a type of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase. When thiol is replaced with another electron donor (e.g. ascorbate), p20 no longer protects against MCO system-induced glutamine synthetase inactivation. Fig. 4 shows that the antioxidant activity of p20 becomes restored, showing a saturation tendency as the concentration of DTT or GSH in the non-thiol-MCO system (e.g. ascorbate/Fe3+/O2) was increased. These results support the possibility that a thiol-re"
https://openalex.org/W2004633655,"Transcription of the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) gene in endothelial cells is induced by the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and lipopolysaccharide. Previous studies demonstrated that the cytokine-response region in the VCAM1 promoter contains binding sites for the transcription factors nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor-1. Using a saturation mutagenesis approach, we report that the cytokine-inducible enhancer consists of these previously characterized elements and a novel region located 3′ of the NF-κB sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprint studies with endothelial nuclear extracts and recombinant protein revealed that the transcriptional activator Sp1 interacts with this novel element in a specific manner. Transient transfection assays using vascular endothelial cells revealed that site-directed mutations in the Sp1 binding element decreased tumor necrosis factor-α-induced activity of the VCAM1 promoter. The cytokine-induced enhancer of the VCAM1 gene requires constitutively bound Sp1 and induced heterodimeric NF-κB for maximal promoter activity. Transcription of the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) gene in endothelial cells is induced by the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and lipopolysaccharide. Previous studies demonstrated that the cytokine-response region in the VCAM1 promoter contains binding sites for the transcription factors nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor-1. Using a saturation mutagenesis approach, we report that the cytokine-inducible enhancer consists of these previously characterized elements and a novel region located 3′ of the NF-κB sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprint studies with endothelial nuclear extracts and recombinant protein revealed that the transcriptional activator Sp1 interacts with this novel element in a specific manner. Transient transfection assays using vascular endothelial cells revealed that site-directed mutations in the Sp1 binding element decreased tumor necrosis factor-α-induced activity of the VCAM1 promoter. The cytokine-induced enhancer of the VCAM1 gene requires constitutively bound Sp1 and induced heterodimeric NF-κB for maximal promoter activity.

VCAM-1 is constitutively expressed in antigen-presenting cells (Freedman et al., 1990; Koopman et al., 1991) and embryonic tissues (Rosen et al., 1992; Gurtner et al., 1995). Vascular endothelium in vivo exhibits little or no VCAM-1 expression under normal conditions but can be rapidly induced by lipopolysaccharide (Fries et al., 1993). The endothelial expression of VCAM-1 has been implicated in the recruitment of circulating monocytes and lymphocytes from the bloodstream (reviewed in Carlos and Harlan, 1994; Springer, 1995) and associated with a variety of chronic inflammatory processes (Rice et al., 1991; Cybulsky and Gimbrone, 1991). vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay polymerase chain reaction base pairs bovine aortic endothelial cells human umbilical vein endothelial cells dithiothreitol tumor necrosis factor-α nuclear factor κB human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat. VCAM-1 has a distinct pattern of cytokine induction in cultured endothelial cells. Naive cells do not express VCAM-1 messenger RNA; however, exposure of cells to inflammatory mediators or cytokines (lipopolysaccharide, poly(I:C), interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) results in rapid up-regulation of mRNA and surface protein within 3 h (Osborn et al., 1989; Read et al., 1994). To study the molecular mechanisms controlling the VCAM-1 response to cytokine, we have characterized the structure of the human VCAM1 gene (Cybulsky et al., 1991) and begun analysis of the 5′-regulatory region (Neish et al., 1992; Shu et al., 1993; Neish et al., 1995). In previous work, we and others demonstrated that TNF-α induction of VCAM1 expression occurs at the transcriptional level and is dependent on tandem NF-κB motifs located at positions -65 and -75 relative to the single transcriptional start site (Neish et al., 1992; Iademarco et al., 1992). Heterodimeric p50 and p65 (RelA) associate with these elements in the nuclei of endothelial cells exposed to TNF-α. Moreover, NF-κB physically and functionally cooperates with the transcriptional activator IRF-1 to achieve full induction of VCAM1 transcription (Neish et al., 1995). The regulatory regions conferring cytokine-inducible transcription in the leukocyte adhesion molecule genes are composed of multiple binding elements, which are recognized by a surprisingly finite number of transcription factors (reviewed in Collins et al., 1995). To provide a detailed characterizaton of the cytokine-induced transcriptional enhancer in the VCAM1 promoter, we employed a saturation mutagenesis approach to completely map the boundaries of regulatory elements that occur within the VCAM1 cytokine-response region. Using this approach, we have identified a novel Sp1 binding motif in the proximal promoter and have demonstrated that optimal cytokine activation of the VCAM1 gene requires Sp1. For the in vitro mutagenesis study, human endothelial cells were obtained from Clonetics and cultured in endothelial growth media (Clonetics) on Primaria dishes (Falcon). Cells from passage four were used for linker scan transfection studies. In these experiments, endothelial cells were exposed to recombinant TNF-α at a concentration of 20 ng/ml for 6 h before harvesting. For preparation of cell extracts, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE) were cultured in M199 with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/ml porcine intestinal heparin, 50 mg/ml endothelial mitogen, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 25 mM HEPES in gelatin-coated plates (Gimbrone, 1976). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated and maintained in culture using previously described procedures (Neish et al., 1992). For experiments involving cytokine activation, confluent monolayers of endothelial cells were exposed to recombinant human TNF-α (Genentech, San Francisco, CA) at a final concentration of 200 units/ml in complete media for the time periods indicated. A wild-type fragment (-2150 to +40) of the VCAM1 promoter was generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two gene-specific primers and a genomic clone as a template. Linker-scanning mutants were generated by PCR as follows. For each construct two complementary primers having individual mutations were designed (see below). The coding primer was used in combination with the 3′-BglII primer, whereas the non-coding one was used in combination with the 5′-SacI primer. Two subfragments were generated, both carrying the mutation at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The fragments were gel purified, aliquots of both were mixed, combined with the two primers 5′-SacI and 3′-BglII, and subjected to the second round of PCR. The reactions were carried out as recommended in the manufacturer's specifications (Perkin Elmer Corp.). The resulting subfragments were digested with SacI and BglII and ligated into the SacI and BglII sites of pGL2-Basic (Promega). The integrity of the individual mutants was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Oligonucleotides used for in vitro mutagenesis are as follows: 5′ SacI, GCCGCCGAGCTCAGTCTAAATCTGTTAACC; 3′ BglII, GCCGCCAGATCTGTATTCAGCTCCTGAAG; LS-100, GTTAATGCGGCCGCGCTGGCTCTGCCCTGGGT and GCCAGCGCGGCCGCATTAACAGACACCCAGCC; LS-90, TTTCCGGCGGCCGCGCCTGGGTTTCCCCTTGA and CCAGGCGCGGCCGCCGGAAAAAAGTTTAACAG; LS-80, TCTGCGGCGGCCGCGCCCTTGAAGGGATTTCC and AAGGGCGCGGCCGCCGCAGAGCCAGGGAAAA; LS-70, GTTTCGGCGGCCGCCGATTTCCCTCCGCCTCT and AAATCGGCGGCCGCCGAAACCCAGGGGCAGAGC; LS-60, GAAGGCGCGGCCGCGCGCCTCGCAACAAGAC and AGGCGCGCGGCCGCGCCTTCAAGGGGAAACCC; LS-50, CCCTCGGCGGCCGCTACAAGACCCTTTATAAA and CTTGTAGCGGCCGCCGAGGGAAATCCCTTCAA; LS-40, CTGCATGCGGCCGCATTATAAAGCACAGACTT and TATAATGCGGCCGCATGCAGAGGCGGAGGGAA (letters in lower case designate introduced nucleotide changes). A fusion gene carrying the region -258 to +42 of the VCAM1 promoter coupled to a CAT reporter gene (pF2) was described and characterized earlier (Neish et al., 1992). A reporter bearing internal point mutations in the Sp1 site, pF2-mSp1, was made from two separate PCR amplification products as described (Neish et al., 1992). The amplified products were gel purified and subcloned into the SmaI site of the reporter plasmid pCAT3 (Promega). Mutagenizing oligonucleotides used for construct generation are as follows: VCAM-RP-Sp1, AAGGGGAAACCCAGGGCAGAG; VCAM-FP-mSp1, GAAGGGATTTCCCTCattgTCTGCAA. HUVE transfections were performed using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's recommendations and as described previously (Schindler and Baichwal, 1994). Cells were lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (Promega), and 10 μl of the extract were used for the luciferase assay (Promega). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Transfections were performed in duplicate at least three times. BAECs were transfected with a modified calcium phosphate technique (Sambrook et al., 1989). Cells were transfected with 10 μg of reporter plasmid. Relative transfection efficiency was determined by cotransfection with pTK-GH (5 μg) (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA). After transfection, cultures were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and refed with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media with or without TNF-α. After 24 h incubation, samples of the medium were collected and assayed for growth hormone by using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute Diagnostics), and cells were harvested. Confluent monolayers were collected by trypsin dissociation, centrifuged (650 × g for 5 min), washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 200 μl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) with 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). Cells were lysed by sonication and one freeze-thaw cycle. Supernatants containing the cell extracts were obtained after centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g and stored at -80°C. Conversion of radiolabeled acetyl coenzyme A to acetylated chloramphenicol was assayed by the two-phase fluor diffusion technique (Sambrook et al., 1989). For each sample, 30-50 μl of cell extract was incubated at 65°C for 15 min to inactivate endogenous transacetylases. The assay was performed in a reaction mixture of 1.25 mM chloramphenicol (Sigma), 125 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and 0.1 mCi of 3H-acetyl coenzyme A (DuPont NEN) in a reaction volume of 200 μl. The reaction mixture was overlaid with 5 ml of water immiscible scintillation fluid (Econofluor, Dupont NEN) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The activity of the 3H-acetylated chloramphenicol was measured using an LKB RackBeta scintillation counter. Transfection experiments were repeated at least three times using at least two independent plasmid preparations. A negative control, the promoterless plasmid pCAT3, showed no inducible activity from any experimental manipulation. Following experimental treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (Read et al., 1994). Monolayers (3-5 × 107 cells) were harvested by scraping, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in two packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 1.5 mM MgC12, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 200 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at 4°C. The crude nuclei released by lysis were collected by microcentrifugation (15 s), rinsed once in buffer A, and resuspended in two-thirds packed cell volume of buffer C (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mM DTT, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin). Nuclei were incubated on a rocking platform at 4°C for 30 min and clarified by microcentrifugation for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were diluted 1:1 with buffer D (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml of both leupeptin and aprotinin). Nuclear extracts were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (50 μCi at 3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. Binding reactions in 20 μl contained 5 μg of nuclear extract protein, binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol), 1 μg of poly(dI:dC), 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 50,000 cpm labeled DNA). Reactions were incubated at 22°C for 20 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 180 V for 2 h in 45 mM Tris borate-EDTA as described by Ausubel(1989). Following electrophoresis, gels were dried, and DNA-protein complexes were localized by autoradiography for 18 h. Competition studies were performed by adding unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides to the binding reaction for 10 min prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. For supershift analysis, nuclear extracts from TNF-α-treated endothelial cells were incubated with 1 μl of antisera or non-immune rabbit serum for 15 min at 22°C prior to addition of binding buffer containing labeled oligonucleotide. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis as described above. Rabbit polyclonal antisera to Sp1, Egr-1, and p50 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). Oligonucleotides utilized are as follows: VCAM-NF+Sp1, CTGGGTTTCCCCTTGAAGGGATTTCCCTCCGCCTCTGCAA; VCAM-NF+mSp1, CTGGGTTTCCCCTTGAAGGGATTTCCCTCattgTCTGCAA; VCAM-Sp1, ATTTCCCTCCGCCTCTGCAA; consensus-Sp1, ATTTCCCCCCGCCCGTGCAA; mutant-Sp1, ATTTCCCTCattgTCTGCAA; VCAM-IRF, GGAGTGAAATAGAAAGTCTGTG. Mutated bases are in lower case. Reverse complement strands were designed to leave G overhangs on one end. All oligonucleotides were polyacrylamide gel purified prior to annealing and labeling. Recombinant human p50•p65 heterodimers were generously provided by Dr. Dimitris Thanos (Columbia University, NY). Recombinant human p50•p50 was prepared using pET expression vectors containing full-length human cDNA in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Recombinant Sp1, purified from HeLa cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus containing human full-length Sp1 cDNA, was obtained from Promega. Binding reactions were carried out for 15 min at 22°C in a total volume of 20 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 32P-NF-Sp1 (50,000 cpm). Recombinant Sp1 was prebound 5 min prior to addition of recombinant NF-κB. Bound complexes were separated from free probe by electrophoresis using non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels and 1 × TBE running buffer. A single-labeled DNA fragment spanning the proximal VCAM-1 promoter was prepared by digesting construct pBS-VCAM-F2-R1 with EcoRI and HindIII, dephosphorylating the ends with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and isolating the 300-bp fragment by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and Qiagen bead purification. The fragment was γ-32P labeled at both ends with T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified using a Chromaspin-10 spin column. Following digestion with PstI, the single end-labeled large fragment was purified using a Chromaspin-100 spin column. Guanine ladders were generated by methylation of the probe with dimethyl sulfate (Aldrich) and subsequent piperidine (Sigma) cleavage. Footprint binding reactions were performed using the 32P 5′-labeled probe in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of 10 × footprint binding buffer (50% glycerol, 50 mM MgCl2, 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9), 0.5 μg poly(dI:dC), 10 μg bovine serum albumin, and increasing amounts of the recombinant protein as indicated. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 4°C. 20 μl of DNase buffer (25 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2) containing 0.02 units DNase I (Promega) was added to each tube and incubated for 5 min at 4°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop solution (150 mM EDTA, 5% SDS, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) and immediate phenol/chloroform extraction prior to DNA precipitation with absolute ethanol. The pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, evaporated to dryness, and resuspended in sequencing sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 2 min and applied to a 6% polyacrylamide gel and run at 1500 V. The gels were subsequently dried and autoradiographed overnight at -80°C. To explore whether the DNA region adjacent to the transcriptional start site of the VCAM-1 promoter is capable of conferring TNF-α-induced expression to a heterologous gene, a 2190-bp fragment of the human VCAM1 promoter (-2150 to + 40) was fused to the coding sequences of the firefly luciferase gene. This plasmid was transfected into HUVE cells, and luciferase activity was measured in untreated cells, as well as in cells that had been exposed to TNF-α for 6 h. This 2190-bp fragment was sufficient to confer TNF-α responsiveness to the luciferase gene (Fig. 1A, full-length). To more precisely delineate the region required for TNF-α inducibility, deletion constructs were generated and tested for cytokine inducibility in HUVE cells. These studies revealed that a plasmid containing the proximal 100 bp of the VCAM1 promoter could be induced by TNF-α as effectively as the -2150 construct (Fig. 1A, compare full-length to LS-100). In contrast, a DNA fragment retaining only 50 bp of 5′-flanking DNA (-50 to +40) was unresponsive to TNF-α (Fig. 1A, deletion). An internal deletion of the promoter, which lacks DNA sequences between -100 and -50, was also not induced by TNF-α (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that a region essential for TNF-α inducibility resides between residues -100 and -50. These observations are consistent with previous reports using constructs bearing a different reporter (CAT) in BAEC (Neish et al., 1992, 1995) and epithelial cells (Shu et al., 1993). This suggests that the κB dependence of the VCAM1 cytokine-induced enhancer is neither species nor cell type specific. However, the specific nature of the Rel family members associating with these elements may vary in different contexts. To identify cis-regulatory sequences required for cytokine-induced expression, we performed a detailed mutational analysis of the region between -100 and -50 (Fig. 1B). In vitro mutagenesis was used to prepare a systematic series of promoter mutants, each differing by only 10 bp from the wild-type construct. The plasmids were transfected into HUVE cells, and luciferase activity was determined in the presence and absence of TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 1A, most of these promoter mutants responded to TNF-α treatment in a manner similar to the wild-type construct. The integrity of one large region of the VCAM1 promoter, -80 to -40 (LS-80, LS-70, LS-60, LS-50), was essential for TNF-α-induced expression in HUVE cells. The -80 to -60 region corresponds to two adjacent consensus NF-κB elements that have previously been determined to be important for cytokine induction (Neish et al., 1992). Interestingly, the -50 to -40 region (LS-50) represents a previously unidentified regulatory element in the VCAM1 promoter. In subsequent studies, we focused on this newly defined regulatory region in the VCAM1 promoter that appeared to be important in TNF-α-induced expression. To identify nuclear proteins that specifically interact with the novel VCAM1 promoter element, EMSA was performed using extracts prepared from TNF-α-treated or untreated HUVE cells and a double-stranded end-labeled oligonucleotide probe extending from -39 to -59. This probe spans the LS-50 region (Fig. 1B) but does not include the adjacent NF-κB elements. A single nucleoprotein complex was formed (Fig. 2A, lane 2, complex A). The complex was competed with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe (lane 3), whereas an unrelated oligonucleotide did not compete (lane 6). Therefore, the protein component of complex A corresponds to a constitutively active nuclear factor, which specifically binds to the novel element in the VCAM1 promoter. The linker scan analysis defined a novel element with a GC-rich core suggestive of an Sp1 site. Competitive EMSA was used to provide suggestive evidence for the involvement of Sp1 in complex A. Complex A was competed by a 100-fold molar excess of an oligonucleotide bearing a consensus Sp1 site (Fig. 2A, lane 4). When the Sp1-like core sequence in the oligonucleotide was mutated (CCGCCT to CattgT), it could no longer compete for binding (Fig. 2A, lane 5). To further implicate the involvement of Sp1 in complex A, supershift analysis was used. The probe containing the putative VCAM1 Sp1 site was incubated with HUVE nuclear extract, from control and TNF-α-induced cells, in the presence of polyclonal antisera to DNA binding proteins. Complex A is identical in control and TNF-α-induced conditions (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 6) and largely supershifted by anti-Sp1 antisera (designated “B,” lanes 3 and 7). The inability of Sp1 antibody to completely supershift the complex may be due to comigration of a nucleoprotein complex unrelated to Sp1 or incomplete recognition due to the phosphorylation state of Sp1. Partial supershifts involving the commercially available antibody used in this study have been reported elsewhere (Kramer et al., 1994; Minowa et al., 1994; Jensen et al., 1995). Complex A is not affected by the presence of antibodies to Egr-1, a related zinc finger transcription factor that binds GC-rich sequences (Cao et al., 1993) (lanes 4 and 8), or anti-p50, a NF-κB subunit abundant in endothelial cells (lanes 5 and 9) (Read et al., 1994). In vitro DNase I footprint analysis was used to determine whether recombinant Sp1 could interact with the human VCAM1 promoter. Sp1 specifically protected a distinct region in the promoter from partial digestion by DNase I in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Comparison of the electrophoretic mobility of the protected region with the G ladder (Fig. 3) indicates that the site bound by Sp1 corresponds to the GC-rich element. The Sp1 binding site was just 3′ to the two previously described κB-binding elements (Neish et al., 1995) protected by recombinant p50 homodimers (Fig. 3). These data indicate that the element bound by Sp1 is in close proximity to the two κB sites in the VCAM1 promoter. To investigate binding of Sp1 and NF-κB in the context of the entire VCAM1 cytokine response region, EMSA was performed with an oligonucleotide probe spanning this region (VCAM-NF+Sp1), which includes both NF-κB sites and the novel Sp1 site. Labeled probe was incubated with nuclear extract derived from unstimulated and TNF-α stimulated HUVEC. As shown in Fig. 4A (lanes 2-4), this probe forms a nucleoprotein complex consistent with Sp1 (complex A). This complex was present equally under all conditions of cytokine activation, while, consistent with previous studies (Neish et al., 1995), NF-κB binds only under induced conditions (designated κB) (lanes 3 and 4). The same experiment was performed with an identically sized probe incorporating a mutated Sp1 site (VCAM-NF+mSp1, CCCGCTC to CCattgC). As expected, this probe was unable to bind Sp1 (lanes 6-8), while the degree of κB binding was unaffected (compare lanes 3 and 4 to lanes 7 and 8). EMSA was used to determine whether recombinant Sp1 could facilitate the interaction of recombinant p50•p65 heterodimer with its recognition element in the VCAM1 promoter. In the absence of Sp1, p50•p65 bound to the probe in a dose-dependent manner (designated κB) (Fig. 4B, lanes 2-4). At high concentrations of NF-κB (lane 4) a complex of slower mobility was observed representing occupancy of both NF-κB sites. Sp1 alone resulted in a complex (designated Sp1, lane 5) with a mobility slower than bound NF-κB. When the probe was prebound with Sp1 then challenged with increasing concentrations of p50•p65, the apparent affinity of the heterodimer for the probe was unaffected (Fig. 4B, compare κB complexes in lanes 2-4 to 6-8). However, at high concentrations of Sp1 and NF-κB an additional band of even slower mobility was detected (designated Sp1+κB, lane 8), representing occupancy of both NF-κB sites and the novel Sp1 site. Thus, while recombinant Sp1 does not affect the ability of recombinant p50•p65 to interact with the VCAM1 promoter, both Sp1 and heterodimeric p50•p65 are able to co-occupy the VCAM1 cytokine response region. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that endothelial Sp1 binds to a novel site in the VCAM1 promoter immediately adjacent to the 3′-NF-κB site. Sp1 binds equally well to its recognition element under quiescent and TNF-α-stimulated conditions and is able to occupy the promoter simultaneously with NF-κB. The findings have not, however, established the functional significance of the Sp1 element in the transcriptional regulation of the VCAM1 gene. To implicate a role for Sp1 in the transcriptional activation of the VCAM1 promoter, mutations that abolished the binding of Sp1 (CCCGCTC to CCattgC, demonstrated in Fig. 2A and Fig. 4A) were introduced into a VCAM1 promoter-reporter construct extending -258 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. Wild-type and mutant constructs were transiently transfected into low passage BAEC and incubated with or without TNF-α. Characteristically, CAT activity driven by the wild-type VCAM1 promoter was induced 5-fold by TNF-α (Fig. 5, bar 1 and 2). In contrast, both basal and induced expression driven by a promoter fragment harboring the mutated Sp1 site was attenuated by approximately 3-fold (Fig. 5, bar 3 and 4). Notably, the mutant construct retains cytokine inducibility. From these data, we conclude that an intact Sp1 binding motif is necessary for optimal levels of cytokine-induced transcription of the VCAM1 gene. Transcriptional enhancer elements are comprised of multiple discrete DNA sequence motifs, each representing a cognate site for a DNA binding protein. The precise number, orientation, and relative positions of these protein binding modules may be critical for proper regulatory function (reviewed by Tjian and Maniatis(1994)). To characterize the cytokine-inducible transcriptional enhancer in the VCAM1 promoter, we have utilized saturation mutagenesis to define the boundaries of relevant positive regulatory regions prior to the characterization of interacting nuclear protein species. Here, we report that both Sp1 and NF-κB are required for maximal activity of the cytokine response region of the VCAM1 promoter. Deletion or mutation in the Sp1 binding motif results in significant attenuation in the ability of the promoter to drive induced transcription in endothelial cells. A key component of cytokine-inducible enhancers is the ubiquitous transcription factor NF-κB (reviewed in Collins et al., 1995). The heterodimeric form (p65•p50) is critical for the transcriptional activation of the human VCAM1 promoter (Neish et al., 1995). It is likely that the specific patterns of transcriptional regulation seen among NF-κB-dependent genes is mediated by the combinatorial interactions of NF-κB with other transcriptional activators and chromatin components. Physical and functional interactions have been shown between NF-κB and ATF-2 (Du et al., 1993), C/EBPβ (Stein et al., 1993a), c-Jun (Stein et al., 1993b), and HMGI(Y) (Thanos and Maniatis, 1992). Previous work with the VCAM1 promoter in our laboratory demonstrated similar interactions between NF-κB and IRF-1 (Neish et al., 1995). Interactions between NF-κB and Sp1 have also been reported. Cooperative functional and physical interactions between NF-κB and Sp1 are required for efficient transcription of the HIV-LTR (Perkins et al., 1993, 1994). This effect is mediated by specific physical interactions between the amino terminus of the p65 Rel domain (RelA) and the zinc finger region of Sp1. Interestingly, the HIV-LTR shares structural similarities with the VCAM1 cytokine response region (Fig. 6); both genes have tandem NF-κB sites located immediately 5′ of an Sp1 motif. Our findings are consistent with the proposal that the juxtaposition of Sp1 and NF-κB elements promotes an interaction between these transcription factors (Perkins et al., 1994). The exposed surfaces of the DNA binding domains of p65 and Sp1 may contact each other in an interaction facilitated by the close approximation of the κB and Sp1 elements. This close physical association in both the HIV-LTR and the VCAM1 enhancer would leave the transactivation domains of both p65 and Sp1 to interact with TATA box binding protein-associated factors, or TAFs. These proteins are coactivators postulated to interact with different types of activation domains and thus integrate signals from distinct bound transcription factors and assemble the basal transcriptional complex. The Sp1 activation domain has been demonstrated to directly and specifically interact with dTAFII110 (Chen et al., 1994). Similarly, p65 has been reported to interact with the TATA box binding protein and enhance transcription (Kerr et al., 1993). These results add to our understanding of the transcription factors necessary for the cytokine responsiveness of this pathophysiologically important gene and provide insights into a general mechanism for the activation of some κB-dependent genes.

https://openalex.org/W2022074355,"Molecular cDNA cloning, two-dimensional gel immunoblotting, and amino acid microsequencing identified three sequence-unique and distinct proteins that constitute a subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins corresponding to hnRNPs H, H′, and F. These proteins share epitopes and sequence identity with two other proteins, isoelectric focusing sample spot numbers 2222 (37.6 kDa; pI 6.5) and 2326 (39.5 kDa; pI 6.6), indicating that the subfamily may contain additional members. The identity between hnRNPs H and H′ is 96%, between H and F 78%, and between H′ and F 75%, respectively. The three proteins contain three repeats, which we denote quasi-RRMs (qRRMs) since they have a remote similarity to the RNA recognition motif (RRM). The three qRRMs of hnRNP H, with a few additional NH2-terminal amino acids, were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and used for ribohomopolymer binding studies. Each qRRM repeat bound poly(rG), while only the NH2-terminal qRRM bound poly(rC) and poly(rU). None of the repeats bound detectable amounts of poly(rA). The expression levels of hnRNPs H and F were differentially regulated in pairs of normal and transformed fibroblasts and keratinocytes. In normal human keratinocytes, the expression level of H was unaffected by treatment with several substances tested including two second messengers and seven cytokines. Likewise the expression level of F was independent of these substances, although it was strikingly down-regulated by long term treatment with 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, indicating that the protein kinase C signaling pathway regulates its expression. No effect of 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was observed on the expression of hnRNP H. The genes coding for hnRNPs H, H′, and F were chromosome-mapped to 5q35.3 (HNRPH1), 6q25.3-q26, and/or Xq22 (HNRPH2) and 10q11.21-q11.22 (HNRPF), respectively. Molecular cDNA cloning, two-dimensional gel immunoblotting, and amino acid microsequencing identified three sequence-unique and distinct proteins that constitute a subfamily of ubiquitously expressed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins corresponding to hnRNPs H, H′, and F. These proteins share epitopes and sequence identity with two other proteins, isoelectric focusing sample spot numbers 2222 (37.6 kDa; pI 6.5) and 2326 (39.5 kDa; pI 6.6), indicating that the subfamily may contain additional members. The identity between hnRNPs H and H′ is 96%, between H and F 78%, and between H′ and F 75%, respectively. The three proteins contain three repeats, which we denote quasi-RRMs (qRRMs) since they have a remote similarity to the RNA recognition motif (RRM). The three qRRMs of hnRNP H, with a few additional NH2-terminal amino acids, were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and used for ribohomopolymer binding studies. Each qRRM repeat bound poly(rG), while only the NH2-terminal qRRM bound poly(rC) and poly(rU). None of the repeats bound detectable amounts of poly(rA). The expression levels of hnRNPs H and F were differentially regulated in pairs of normal and transformed fibroblasts and keratinocytes. In normal human keratinocytes, the expression level of H was unaffected by treatment with several substances tested including two second messengers and seven cytokines. Likewise the expression level of F was independent of these substances, although it was strikingly down-regulated by long term treatment with 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, indicating that the protein kinase C signaling pathway regulates its expression. No effect of 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was observed on the expression of hnRNP H. The genes coding for hnRNPs H, H′, and F were chromosome-mapped to 5q35.3 (HNRPH1), 6q25.3-q26, and/or Xq22 (HNRPH2) and 10q11.21-q11.22 (HNRPF), respectively. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) ( 1The abbreviations used are: hnRNPheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteinIEFisoelectric focusingILinterleukinNEPHGEnonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresisRRMRNA recognition motifqRRMquasi-RRMSSCsodium chloride/sodium citrateSSPsample spot number.) constitute a set of polypeptides that bind heterogeneous nuclear RNA, the transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II (Dreyfuss et al., 1993). While all of the hnRNPs are present in the nucleus some seem to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The full range of functions of the hnRNPs are at present unknown, although these may include pre-mRNA processing and transport as well as roles in the interaction of heterogeneous nuclear RNA with other nuclear structures (Dreyfuss et al., 1993). To date, more than 20 such proteins have been described and designated with letters from A to U (Dreyfuss et al., 1993). The different subclasses are characterized by their preferred binding of ribohomopolymers at 2 M NaCl; for example hnRNPs F, P, H, and M, and a subset of the E proteins bind poly(rG), hnRNP P binds poly(rA), and hnRNPs C and M bind poly(rU), while hnRNPs K and J bind poly(rC) (Swanson and Dreyfuss, 1988). The primary structure of several of these proteins, which have been deduced from their corresponding cDNAs, often exhibit a modular structure that contains one or more RNA binding domains (the RNA recognition motif, RRM also called the RNP motif; the arginine-rich motif; the RGG box; the KH motif; and other types) as well as one or more auxiliary domains (with clusters rich in a few amino acids, frequently glycines) that have been assigned a number of different putative functions (Biamonti and Riva, 1994). Isoforms of these proteins have been reported and are generated by alternative processing of pre-mRNA and by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylations of serines and threonines and methylation of arginines as well as other as yet uncharacterized modifications. heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein isoelectric focusing interleukin nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis RNA recognition motif quasi-RRM sodium chloride/sodium citrate sample spot number. As a result of a systematic analysis of human keratinocyte protein profiles using computer-aided two-dimensional gel electrophoresis we have revealed many proteins that are differentially regulated in SV40-transformed cells (Celis and Olsen, 1994). Among the highly up-regulated proteins, some are present in purified 40 S hnRNP particles, e.g. hnRNPs A, B, C, H, and K (Celis et al., 1986; Celis and Olsen, 1994; Dejgaard et al., 1994), indicating that changes in the levels of these proteins are necessary to maintain the protein expression phenotype exhibited by transformed cells. Recently, Matunis et al.(1994) cloned hnRNP F and showed that it is immunologically related as well as sequence related to hnRNP H, implying that these proteins are very similar. Their results, however, could not reveal whether these proteins were truly different or represented variants produced by alternative splicing of the same pre-mRNA. Using cDNA cloning, two-dimensional gel immunoblotting, and amino acid microsequencing we here show that hnRNP H has a unique primary structure and that it belongs to a subfamily of hnRNP proteins that includes hnRNP F, H′ (identical to the FTP3 gene product (Vorechovsky et al., 1994)), and most likely two novel proteins with apparent molecular masses of 37.6 and 39.5 kDa, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the genes coding for hnRNPs H, H′, and F were localized on different chromosomes. In addition, we present ribohomopolymer binding experiments on hnRNP H as well as biochemical studies showing that hnRNPs H and F possess distinct regulatory properties. Primary normal human keratinocytes were obtained by plating unfractionated keratinocytes in 3-cm diameter Petri dishes coated with human dermal extract prepared as described (Madsen et al., 1992) with 3 ml of serum-free keratinocyte medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml), bovine pituitary extract (50 μg/ml), and antibiotics (penicillin at 100 units/ml and streptomycin at 50 μg/ml). SV40-transformed (K14) keratinocytes (Taylor-Papadimitriou et al., 1982), normal human MRC-5 fibroblasts, and SV40-transformed MRC-5 fibroblasts (MRC-5 V2) (Huschtscha and Holliday, 1983) were grown as monolayer cultures, and Molt-4 cells in suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that was supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin at 100 units/ml and streptomycin at 50 μg/ml). Primary keratinocyte cultures were labeled for 14 h in serum-free keratinocyte medium lacking methionine (prepared by Life Technologies, Inc.) and containing 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (SJ204, Amersham Corp.) per 0.1 ml of medium. Primary keratinocytes were treated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP, dibutyryl cyclic GMP, interferon-α, interferon-β, transforming growth factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-3, IL-7, IL-8, or tumor necrosis factor-α 5 days after plating as described previously (Honoréet al. 1993a). K14 keratinocytes, MRC-5, and MRC-5 V2 fibroblasts grown in microtiter wells (NUNC) were labeled for 14 h with 0.1 ml of laboratory-made Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g/liter, NaHCO3) lacking methionine and containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (SJ204, Amersham) (Bravo et al., 1982). The procedure for running two-dimensional gels and silver staining have been previously described in detail (Bravo et al., 1982; Tunón and Johansson, 1984; Celis et al., 1994b). Nuclear extracts of Molt-4 cells were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, directly or after purification on hydroxyapatite, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Celis et al., 1990). Several protein spots including IEF SSPs 4410, 4429, 5416, 6304, 7312 (previously numbered 6320), 2222, 2326, and 3415 (Celis et al., 1994a) were cut from a number of gels and subjected to partial amino acid sequencing as described previously (Vandekerckhove and Rasmussen, 1994). The cDNA library made from MRC-5 V2 fibroblasts has previously been described in detail (Honoréet al., 1992). A cDNA library from psoriatic keratinocytes was constructed by priming mRNA with (dT)15 containing an XhoI and a SacI site in the 5′ end. The size-fractionated cDNA (>2 kilobases) was ligated into > Uni-ZAP XR cut with XhoI and EcoRI. The amplified libraries were plated on 25 × 25-cm plates containing 1.5 × 105 plaque-forming units, and overlaid with nylon filters (Hybond-N, Amersham). The DNA was covalently linked to the filters by UV light. A mixture of 23-mer deoxyribonucleotides was synthesized (number 2625): 5′-d(AARYTIATGGCIATGCARMGICC)-3′, where R is a purine, Y is a pyrimidine, I is deoxyinosine, and M is A or C. The oligonucleotides were labeled in the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and used to screen 6 × 105 plaque-forming units from the 800-2500-base pair MRC-5 V2 library (Honoréet al. 1992). Filters were hybridized at 48°C with the tetramethylammonium chloride technique (Jacobs et al., 1988; Honoréet al., 1993b). The filters were sealed in plastic bags, and autoradiography was done with Kodak x-ray films and intensifying screens at -70°C. The screening gave about six positive clones. The clones were purified by repeated platings and hybridizations. The cloned cDNAs were rescued in pBluescript according to the manual from Stratagene. Minipreps of plasmid DNA were made as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). Clone 2625.5 was recloned into the NotI and SalI sites in M13BM20 or -21 and used for large scale preparation of DNA (Sambrook et al., 1989) for sequencing as described below. We then end-sequenced the other clones. Except for a few artifact clones all were found to contain parts of the same cDNA insert. Clone 2625.5 was labeled by using random primers and used to screen the psoriatic keratinocyte library as follows. The filters were first hybridized at low stringency conditions, 55°C in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M Na3citrate) overnight, then washed two times for 15 min at 55°C in 1 × SSC and autoradiographed. A second wash was then performed at high stringency conditions, 65°C first in 1 × SSC for 15 min and then for 15 min in 0.1 × SSC followed by autoradiography. Thirteen clones that were strongly hybridizing at low stringency and weakly at high stringency were purified, rescued in pBluescript, and sequenced in their 5′ and 3′ ends. DNA sequencing was performed as described previously (Honoréet al., 1992, 1993a). The reported sequence of clone 2625.5 was determined from both strands. Control sequencing of clones related to 2625.5 were performed on one strand on the double-stranded plasmids with oligonucleotides for every 150 bases in the coding regions. Sequence analysis was performed with the UWGCG program package (Devereux et al., 1984). A sequence identity search was carried out with the Mailfasta program in the publicly available DNA and protein data bases. Alignments of amino acid sequences were done with the Clustal V program (Higgins et al., 1992) and printed with the Alscript program (Barton, 1993). DNA segments encoding selected amino acid parts of the protein encoded by the 2625.5-cDNA were amplified with AmpliTaq (Perkin Elmer) through 40 cycles (denaturation at 93°C, annealing at 55°C, and polymerization at 72°C). The following peptide fragments were made: Gly10-Glu92 (qRRM1), Gly111-Glu190 (qRRM2), Gly288-Gly366 (qRRM3), and the whole insert Met1-Ala449 (TOT). The primers used in the sense direction contained a BamHI site (5′-CACGGATCC) followed by 18 bases encoding the first six amino acids in the fragment. The primers used in the antisense direction contained a HindIII site followed by an A (5′-TTCAAGCTTA) or an EcoRV site followed by TTA (5′-TTCGATATCTTA) and then 18 bases that were complementary to the strand encoding the last six amino acids in the fragment. A stop codon was thus inserted after the last amino acid in each fragment. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA-fragments were cut with the restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII or BamHI and EcoRV and ligated into the expression vector pT7-PL (Christensen et al., 1991), a derivative of the T7 promoter containing plasmid pRK172. The fusion proteins are synthesized with MGSHHHHHHGS in the NH2 terminal. The recombinant plasmids were grown up in E. coli XL-1 Blue, and the three qRRM fragments were sequenced in order to check the cDNA inserts for errors introduced during the amplification process. E. coli XL-1 Blue or BL21(DE3) cells transformed with error-free plasmids were grown at 37°C to an absorbance, A600, of 0.6-0.7 when the recombinant proteins were expressed by adding CE6 >-phages to XL-1 Blue cultures and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to BL21(DE3) cultures (Studier and Moffatt, 1986). The cells were grown for an additional 4 h and then centrifuged, resuspended in buffer A (500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and extracted with 1 volume of phenol. The cells were sonicated and the proteins precipitated by adding 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The precipitated proteins were resuspended in buffer B (6 M guanidine-HCl, 100 mM dithioerythritol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), added to a Sephadex G25 column and eluted with buffer C (8 M urea, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM methionine, 5 mM glutathion, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The collected protein fractions were pooled and added to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Hochuli et al., 1987), washed first with buffer D (6 M guanidine-HCl, 5 mM glutathion, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), buffer C, and finally with buffer E (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The qRRM fragments were finally eluted with 0.2 M sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 4. The TOT fragment was eluted with 8 M urea, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8. The obtained qRRM hexa-His proteins were used as such for the Northwestern dot blotting as described below. The TOT fragment on the other hand contained substantial amounts of impurities, which possibly were degradation products, and was therefore further purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cut out from the gel, electroeluted, and finally used for injection into a mouse for the production of a polyclonal antibody. Clone 2625.5 was digested with NotI, made blunt-ended, and cut out with PstI. The cDNA fragment was cloned into the plasmid pMT21 (Kaufman et al., 1991), cut with EcoRI, made blunt-ended and finally cut with PstI. The plasmid DNA was transfected into COS-1 monkey cells (Gluzman, 1981) with LipofectinAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as transfection agent (Düzgünes and Felgner, 1993). COS-1 cells were resuspended in lysis solution (O'Farrell, 1975) and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The ribohomopolymers poly(rA), poly(rC), poly(rG), and poly(rU) from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. were 5′-end labeled with 32P. The peptides qRRM1, qRRM2, and qRRM3 were dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose in similar amounts as determined by visual inspection of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained peptides. Hybridization and washing procedures were as described previously (Dejgaard and Celis, 1994). Chromosome mapping was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization as described previously (Tommerup and Vissing, 1995). Individual cDNA clones inserted in vectors, corresponding to genes HNRPH1 (2625.5-cDNA), HNRPH2 (4410LH.31-cDNA), and HNRPF (4410LH.30-cDNA) were labeled with biotin by nick-translation in the presence of bio-11-dUTP (Sigma) and hybridized to human metaphase chromosomes. For each cDNA, 50 metaphases were examined in a Zeiss Periplan epifluorescence microscope for distribution of signals. Selected metaphases were photographed on Kodak Ektachrome EPY64T, and the signal position (the relative distances from the short arm telomere to the signal (FLpter) was measured on projected slides and compared with the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole pattern and with the digitized chromosome ideogram (Francke, 1994). Analysis of proteins synthesized by normal and SV40-transformed K14 keratinocytes (Taylor-Papadimitriou et al., 1982) has revealed several polypeptides that are differentially regulated in K14 cells (Celis and Olsen, 1994) and that are enriched in nuclear pellets (Fig. 1) and in purified 40 S hnRNP particles (Celis et al., 1986). One of these polypeptides (IEF SSP 4410 in the keratinocyte protein data base) (Celis et al. 1994a) (Fig. 1A), which comigrated with purified hnRNP H, was selected for further studies, as this protein is 1.6-fold up-regulated in K14 cells (Celis and Olsen, 1994), and several peptide sequences were available in the keratinocyte data base (kLMAMQrPGPYDr, PGAGrGYNSIGrGAGFEr, YIEIF, and ThYDP, where residues given in lowercase could not be unambiguously assigned) (Rasmussen et al., 1992). Peptide kLMAMQrP, which contained a reasonably low degree of degeneracy at codons with ambiguity, was back-translated to nucleotide sequence, and a mixture of 23-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligo number 2625) was used to screen the MRC-5 V2 cDNA library as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 2 shows the cDNA sequence obtained from clone 2625.5 (hnRNP H), which contains 2201 base pairs with a 19-base pair-long poly(A) tail. A multiple tissue Northern blot hybridized with this cDNA revealed a transcript length of at least 2.4 kilobases expressed at high levels in placenta and skeletal muscle, but also in brain, lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas. A number of start codons are found in the 5′-end of the cDNA, but the longest open reading frame is obtained from the start codon at position 73-75, which is preceded by an in-frame stop codon at positions 64-66. Another start codon is found at positions 76-78, immediately downstream from the first one. The observed patterns of flanking nucleotides around these two codons, AXXATGA and AXXATGT occur at a frequency of 17 and 8%, respectively, in vertebrates (Cavener and Ray, 1991). Since only 9% of vertebrate mRNAs have start codons in the 5′ noncoding region (Kozak, 1987) it is most likely that the start codon at positions 73-75 is the functional one. The stop codon, TAG, is found at positions 1420-1422, and a putative polyadenylation site, AATAAA, is located 19 base pairs upstream from the poly(A) tail. The encoded protein contains 449 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 49.2 kDa and a pI of 6.26. These values match closely those observed experimentally for IEF SSP 4410 (Celis et al., 1994a), i.e. 52.8 kDa and a pI of 5.9. Furthermore, the sequences of the four microsequenced peptides matched perfectly within the amino acid sequence as deduced from the cDNA (Fig. 2). As an additional control the hnRNP H-cDNA was overexpressed in COS-1 cells using the pMT21 expression vector. Subsequent two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of the [35S]methionine-labeled proteins indicated that the protein encoded by the hnRNP H-cDNA comigrated with endogenously synthesized hnRNP H (results not shown). Microsequencing results obtained on two other proteins migrating toward the acidic side of hnRNP H, i.e. IEF SSPs 5416 and 4429 (Fig. 1A), revealed similar sequences as those encoded by the hnRNP H-cDNA, suggesting that they correspond to modified variants of hnRNP H. The first and possibly the second variant are phosphorylated (results not shown).Figure 2Nucleotide sequence of the 2625.5-cDNA (hnRNP H-cDNA). The cDNA is 2201 bases long with a poly(A) tail of 19 bases. The putative polyadenylation signal, AATAAA (underlined), is located 19 base pairs upstream from the poly(A) tail. A 449-amino acid protein is encoded between the start codon at positions 73-75 and the stop codon at positions 1420-1422 (indicated with asterisks). The molecular mass of the predicted protein is 49.2 kDa, and the calculated pI is 6.26, values that are in close agreement with the experimentally observed values of keratinocyte protein IEF SSP 4410 (hnRNP H), 52.8 kDa and pI 5.9 (Celis et al., 1994a). The four partial peptide sequences obtained by microsequencing are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A mouse polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant hnRNP H produced in E. coli was used to probe two-dimensional gel immunoblots of Molt-4 extracts enriched in nuclear proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, the antibody reacted with several proteins, which are indicated with their IEF numbers in the keratinocyte data base (Celis et al., 1994a). A strong reaction was observed with hnRNP H (IEF SSP 4410) and its variants (IEF SSPs 5416 and 4429) as well as with IEF SSPs 6304, 7312, 2222, 2326, 3415, 4432, and a putative cleavage product of hnRNP H (see Fig. 3). However, since no preimmune control was available for the antibody shown in Fig. 3 we microsequenced the reacting proteins that were present in sufficient quantities, i.e. IEF SSPs 6304, 7312, 2222, 2326, and 3415 with the results given in Table 1. The tryptic peptide maps of IEF SSPs 6304 and 7312 were identical, and the peptide sequences could be aligned to hnRNP H when very few amino acid exchanges were allowed. The five peptides obtained from 6304 showed between 80 and 100% identity to hnRNP H, and the single peptide obtained from 7312 showed 83% identity, thus confirming that both proteins are sequence-related to hnRNP H. Data base searching with the peptides identified the 6304 and 7312 proteins as hnRNP F (Fig. 3) (Matunis et al., 1994).TABLE I Open table in a new tab The tryptic peptide maps of IEF SSPs 2222 and 2326 were identical and different from the maps of 6304, 7312, and hnRNP H(4410). Sequencing results from 2222 gave identity scores between 45 and 93% to hnRNP H, while peptides from 2326 showed identities between 90 and 100% to hnRNP H. Data base searching indicated that these proteins were novel, although some similarity was found to the recently cloned poly(A)+ mRNA binding protein GRSF-1 (Qian and Wilusz, 1994), which shares 46% identity to hnRNP H and 44% to hnRNP F. One protein that shared epitopes with hnRNP H had a lower molecular mass and higher pI but revealed an almost identical tryptic peptide map to that of hnRNP H. Furthermore, microsequencing of the protein did not reveal any differences in the amino acid sequences from those predicted from the hnRNP H-cDNA. Some immunoreaction of the hnRNP antibody with this polypeptide could only be detected in nuclear proteins from Molt-4 cells and not in total cell extracts from e.g. AMA cells or K14 keratinocytes, so we concluded that this protein most likely corresponds to a cleavage product of hnRNP H (shown as H cleavage prod. in Fig. 3). The tryptic map of polypeptide IEF 3415 was very different from that of hnRNP H, 6304, 7312, 2222, and 2326, and the peptide sequences showed no significant identity (between 29 and 43%) to hnRNP H. Thus the presence of IEF 3415 in the immunoblot may be due to a spurious cross-reactivity. The possibility, however, cannot be excluded that the microsequences are derived from a major unrelated protein and that the observed cross-reactivity is due to a minor comigrating related protein. In conclusion, it appears that at least hnRNP H and variants (4410, 5416, and 4429) and hnRNP F and its variant (6304 and 7312) are closely related proteins. Based on tryptic peptide sequences IEF SSPs 2222 and 2326 are definitely related to hnRNPs H and F, while IEF 3415 apparently is unrelated. In an effort to reveal additional hnRNP H-related proteins we screened the keratinocyte cDNA library with a low/high stringency hybridization technique using the hnRNP H-cDNA as probe. Among 13 clones that were found to be different from hnRNP H because they hybridized at low but not at high stringency, we found 10 containing one type of transcript and three with another type as determined by end sequencing. Data base searching revealed two transcripts that possessed very high similarity to the hnRNP H-cDNA, and these corresponded to the FTP3 transcript (82%) (Vorechovsky et al., 1994) and hnRNP F mRNA (73%) (Matunis et al., 1994). Sequencing on one strand of one representative clone from each of the above mentioned types of transcripts verified that clone 4410LH.31 corresponded to the FTP3 transcript, and 4410LH.30 corresponded to hnRNP F mRNA. ( 2Sequencing on one strand indicated that clone 4410LH.31 was identical with the FTP3 transcript (Vorechovsky et al., 1994) from base 79 to 1428 (accession number U01923), except that we found a C instead of a T at position 687, which, however, did not change the deduced amino acid at that position. Clone 4410LH.30 was identical with the cDNA for the hnRNP F mRNA (Matunis et al., 1994) from base 29 to 1276 (accession number L28010).) Translation of the FTP3 and hnRNP F transcripts yielded proteins with deduced molecular masses of 49.3 kDa (pI 6.26) and 45.7 kDa (pI 5.39), respectively. The coordinates of the proteins encoded by the hnRNP H-cDNA (49.2 kDa and pI 6.26) and the 4410LH.31-cDNA (FTP3 transcript) (49.3 kDa and pI 6.26) were almost identical, indicating that they may comigrate in two-dimensional gels. Alternatively, the 4410LH.31 cDNA could encode protein IEF SSP 4432 (Fig. 3), which has a slightly higher molecular mass (54.2 kDa) and a more basic pI (6.0) than hnRNP H. For convenience, we will refer to these two proteins as hnRNP H (2625.5-cDNA) and hnRNP H′ (4410LH.31-cDNA/FTP3 transcript) (see Table 2). Subcloning of the cDNA encoding hnRNP H′ into pMT21 for COS-1 cell expression has repeatedly failed; therefore, we have been unable to verify the position of the encoded protein in two-dimensional gels. The deduced coordinates of hnRNP F from the 4410LH.30 cDNA (45.7 kDa and pI 5.39) indicates that this cDNA encodes protein IEF SSP 6304 and its phosphorylated variant IEF SSP 7312 (Table 2).TABLE II Open table in a new tab The alignment of the sequences of hnRNPs H, H′, and F is shown in Fig. 4A. The identity is 96% between hnRNPs H and H′, 78% between H and F, and 75% between H′ and F. Each of the three proteins has a high content of Gly residues (12-15%). Internal sequence comparisons of hnRNPs H, H′, and F revealed a repeated structure of each protein (Fig. 4B). hnRNPs H and H′ show three repeats of about 80 residues localized at the approximate amino acid positions 10-92, 111-190, and 288-366 containing the conserved motifs; VXXRGLP, FFS, GRXXGEAXV, and HRY(V/I)E(V/I/L)F. hnRNP F shows similar repeats, except that one repeat contains FLS instead of FFS while another contains GKXX … instead of GRXX…. We denote these repeats qRRMs (Fig. 6, dark gray boxes, and see below).Figure 6Repeats found in hnRNP H, hnRNP H′, and hnRNP F. qRRM (quasi-RRM) indicates a domain with a remote similarity to the RRM, GYR denotes a G-, Y-, and R-rich region and GY denotes a G- and Y-rich region.

The LIM motif defines a zinc-binding domain that is found in a variety of transcriptional regulators, proto-oncogene products, and proteins associated with sites of cell-substratum contact. One type of LIM-domain protein, called the cysteine-rich protein (CRP), is characterized by the presence of two LIM domains linked to short glycine-rich repeats and a potential nuclear localization signal. We have identified and characterized two evolutionarily conserved members of the CRP family, CRP1 and CRP2, in chicken and quail. Expression of the genes encoding both CRP1 and CRP2 is differentially regulated in normal versus transformed cells, raising the possibility that members of the CRP family may function in control of cell growth and differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2026512448,"Fatty acid synthase (FAS) plays a central role in de novo lipogenesis in mammals. The concentration or activity of FAS in liver and adipose tissue changes dramatically when animals are subjected to nutritional and hormonal manipulations. We previously reported that due to changes in transcription, FAS synthesis declines and increases in an insulin-dependent manner during fasting and refeeding, respectively, and that insulin administration of streptozotocin-diabetic mice stimulates FAS transcription. We previously mapped the FAS insulin response sequence (IRS) to the proximal promoter region from position -71 to position -50, which contains an E-box DNA binding motif. Here, using competition gel shift assays and specific upstream stimulatory factor (USF) antibodies, we identified USF1 and USF2 as major components of complexes that bind to the FAS IRS. UV-cross-linking experiments further supported that USFs bind the FAS IRS. We also found that the amount of the 43-kDa USF1 was dramatically increased in liver of refed rats. In contrast, the amount of USF2 remained the same in liver of fasted or refed rats. Moreover, a 17-kDa protein in both fasted and refed rat liver was recognized by anti-USF1 antibodies, and this 17-kDa USF1-related protein was expressed in a manner opposite to that of the 43-kDa USF1, i.e. high in liver of fasted rats and decreased in liver of refed rats. These data suggest that the regulation of USF expression may play an important role in the regulation of FAS transcription.

By the action of its seven active sites, FAS catalyzes all the reaction steps in the conversion of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA to palmitate. FAS activity is not known to be regulated by allosteric effectors or covalent modification. However, the FAS concentration is exquisitely sensitive to nutritional, hormonal, and developmental status(1Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Volpe J.J. Vagelos P.R. Physiol. Rev. 1976; 56: 339-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The concentration or activity of FAS in liver and adipose tissue changes dramatically when animals are subjected to different nutritional and hormonal manipulations. The rate of FAS synthesis declines when rats are fasted for 1-2 days while refeeding a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet increases synthesis of FAS(3Lakshmanan M.R. Nepokrodff C.M. Porter J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3516-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Increased circulating insulin and decreased glucagon levels may participate in regulation of FAS synthesis. We previously reported that FAS mRNA was not detectable in liver of fasted mice and that refeeding with a high carbohydrate diet dramatically increased the level of FAS mRNA, due to changes in the rate of FAS gene transcription(4Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of FAS gene transcription by fasting/refeeding was not observed in liver of streptozotocin-diabetic mice, in which FAS expression is detected at a very low level(5Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of insulin to streptozotocin-diabetic mice stimulated the level of FAS mRNA and FAS transcription rate(5Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also reported that insulin increased levels of FAS mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes(4Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences mediating insulin induction of the FAS gene have been located to the first 332 base pairs of the FAS promoter by transient transfection of H4IIE hepatoma cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (6Moustaid N. Sakamoto K. Clarke S. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We further mapped insulin response sequence (IRS) to the proximal promoter region from position -71 to position -50 by chimeric constructions of serial 5′-deletions of the rat FAS gene promoter ligated to the luciferase reporter gene and transfection into 3T3-L1 adipocytes(7Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This IRS confers a stimulation of the FAS promoter activity by insulin, at physiological concentrations, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we also demonstrated that three tandem repeats of FAS IRS linked to a heterologous SV40 promoter were responsive to insulin. Both liver and adipocyte nuclear proteins bind to the FAS promoter, resulting in the IRS region being protected on DNase I footprinting analysis and specific band shift on a gel mobility shift assay(7Moustaid N.

Biol. 1991; 148: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Like other bHLH transcription factors such as Myc, E12, E47, and MyoD, USF binds to the “E-box” DNA binding motif, consisting of a canonical CANNTG sequence. In addition to the bHLH motif, a leucine-zipper (LZ) is immediately adjacent to bHLH and is also important for USF dimerization and DNA binding(15Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The transcription activation domain of USF has been located at the N terminus of the protein and consists of two subregions(21Kirschbaum B.J. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5094-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2 have been found to be ubiquitously expressed, at various levels, in mammalian cells and bind to an E-box as homo- and heterodimers(16Sirito M. Walker S. Lin Q. Kozlowski M.T. Klein W.H.

Two examples are the rat S14 gene (34Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol.

In this paper, we describe the identification of USF1 and USF2 as major components of protein complexes that bind to IRS of the FAS promoter, and we report changes in the amount of USF1, but not of USF2, associated with fasting and refeeding treatments. The amount of the 43-kDa USF1 was dramatically increased in liver of refed rats. In contrast, the amount of USF2 remained the same in liver of fasted and refed rats. Moreover, a 17-kDa protein in both fasted and refed rat liver was recognized by anti-USF1 antibodies, and this 17-kDa USF1-related protein was expressed in a manner opposite to that of the 43-kDa USF1, i.e. high in liver of fasted rats and decreased in liver of refed rats. Because the body circulatory insulin level is decreased and increased by fasting and refeeding, respectively, and insulin closely regulates FAS transcription, changes of USF1, which binds to the FAS IRS, may play an important role in the regulation of FAS transcription by insulin. Nuclear extracts from liver of fasted rats (referred to as FNE in later parts of this paper) were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) after fasting for 48 h. Nuclear extracts from liver of refed rats (referred to as RNE in later parts of this paper) were prepared after refeeding a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet to the fasted rats for 12 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously by Dignam et al.(44Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The RNE was precipitated with 20-55% saturation of ammonium sulfate and both FNE and RNE were dialyzed against Buffer D (20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM ditiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM EGTA). The following single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA Synthesis Facility at the University of California, Berkeley. Double-stranded DNA was formed as described previously(7Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Gel mobility shift assay was carried out as described previously(7Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μg of nuclear extract protein was added to a 20-μl binding reaction containing 20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 8% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 × 104 cpm 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (0.1 ng), and various competitors, if any, at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the binding reaction mixture was applied to a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run in 1 × gel running buffer (50 mM Tris, 380 mM glycine, 2 mM EDTA) at 20 mA constant current for 2 h. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray films with intensifying screens. For antibody “supershift” assays, 2 μl of 1 μg/μl α-USF1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or 1: 50 dilution of α-USF2 antibody, kindly provided by Dr. Sawadogo (M. D. Anderson Medical Center, University of Texas), was added to the binding reaction mixture and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature before being applied to the gel. Western immunoblot of USFs were performed as described(45Millipore Protein Blotting Protocols for Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane. Millipore, Bedford, MA1990Google Scholar). Briefly, 80 μg of nuclear extracts were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and wet-transferred on to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) with a Bio-Rad TransBlot cell. The membrane was blocked with blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% milk and 1 × NET buffer (144 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) gelatin, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), incubated with primary antibodies (α-USF1 at 0.2 μg/ml or α-USF2 at 1:5000 dilution) in blocking solution, and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution in blocking solution), and developed with Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (DuPont NEN). 20 μl of gel shift binding reaction as described above was exposed to UV light in a Bio-Rad Gene Linker for 10 min at a distance of 10 cm from the UV source. Then SDS loading buffer was added to 1 × concentration and reaction mixture applied to 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed with 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol and then exposed to x-ray films with an intensifying screen. We showed previously that the FAS gene promoter segment from -71 to -50 is the FAS IRS(7Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This segment contains the sequence 5′-CATGTG-3′ from position -65 to position -60, the E-box DNA binding motif of the bHLH family of transcription factors. Since the ubiquitous USF was initially identified by its ability to bind to the E-box within the AdML promoter, we investigated whether USFs were the hepatic factors that bind to the FAS IRS using gel mobility shift assays. The FAS IRS oligonucleotide containing the FAS promoter sequence from position -76 to position -50 was 32P-labeled by a Klenow fragment filling-in and incubated with RNE prepared from fasted and then refed rat. Two major protein-DNA complexes, referred to as Band 1 and Band 2 in Fig. 1, were detected by gel mobility shift assay. The migration pattern of these two bands was found to be very similar, if not identical, to those formed by using end-labeled S14 and L-PK gene carbohydrate response elements as probes (Fig. 1). Since USF- or USF-related proteins bind to the E-box sequence of S14 and L-PK carbohydrate response elements, we tested whether these sequences compete for the nuclear factors binding to FAS IRS. As shown in Fig. 1, both S14 and L-PK carbohydrate response element oligonucleotides, as well as FAS IRS itself, could effectively compete for the formation of Band 1 and 2 at 20- and 40-fold molar excess to the labeled FAS IRS probe. Addition of the same amount of poly(dI-dC) to the gel mobility shift reactions had no such effect, suggesting that the competition detected under these conditions is specific. Oligonucleotides derived from the AdML promoter and mutation of the GCC upstream of the FAS IRS E-box to TAA could also effectively compete for the protein-DNA complexes in Band 1 and 2, while mutation of the E-box sequence CATGTG to ACTGGT and the sterol response element, the binding site for sterol response element-1-binding protein, did not (data not shown). These results suggest that similar USFs bind to the E-box of FAS IRS as well as S14 and L-PK gene carbohydrate response elements. To further demonstrate that USFs bind to the FAS IRS, we tested whether Band 1 and 2 in Fig. 1 are affected by addition of USF-specific antibodies to the gel mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, incubating RNEs with FAS IRS probe in the presence of anti-USF1 antibodies directed against the C-terminal 20 amino acids (position 291-310) completely disrupted these two major bands and resulted in “supershifts.” At the same time, a new protein-DNA complex (Band 3) appeared upon the addition of anti-USF1 antibodies. This newly appeared band did not appear to be caused by protein contaminants of the antibody preparation because gel shift assays with fixed amounts of anti-USF1 antibody and increasing amount of nuclear extract (2-8 μg) resulted in a proportionally increased amount of Band 3 (Fig. 2B). This result demonstrates that 1) USF1 is a major component of the protein complexes that bind to FAS IRS and 2) within the nuclear extract there is at least one additional protein component that binds to the FAS IRS, probably by forming heterocomplexes with USF1. Within the USF transcription factor family, USF2 is known to be able to heterodimerize with USF1 and has the same binding affinity to E-box sequences as USF1(48Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11994-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, no other proteins have been reported to heterodimerize with USF1 and regulate gene transcription. To test whether USF2 is the other protein involved in binding to FAS IRS, we performed the following two experiments. First, to test the E-box specificity of Band 3, a gel mobility shift competition assay was carried out in the presence of anti-USF1 antibodies and with S14 and L-PK oligonucleotides as competitors (Fig. 3A). Both S14 and L-PK carbohydrate response elements, at molar excesses of 20- and 40-fold, could compete for the formation of Band 3, as well as for the two supershifted bands. Compared to S14 sequence, L-PK sequence was found to compete less effectively. As expected, FAS IRS itself competed and nonspecific poly(dI-dC) did not. This result suggests that Band 3 represents an E-box-specific protein-DNA complex, which supports the probability that it contains USF2. The second experiment used rabbit polyclonal anti-USF2 antiserum in the gel shift assay to directly detect the presence of USF2 in Band 3. As shown in Fig. 3B, addition of anti-USF2, together with anti-USF1 antibody to the gel shift assay resulted in the total disappearance of Band 3, as well as the lower supershifted band (lane 4) formed by the addition of anti-USF1 antibody alone, demonstrating the presence of USF2 in Band 3. On the other hand, adding anti-USF2 antibody alone (lane 3, Fig. 3B) to the gel shift assay disrupted protein-DNA complex formation in both Band 1 and 2, suggesting USF2 is present in both of them. Taken together, we concluded that USF2 is the other major protein component that interacts and forms protein heterocomplexes with USF1 to bind FAS IRS. To provide further supporting data for the involvement of USF1 and USF2 as major protein factors in the FAS IRS binding, we performed an UV-cross-linking experiment. The protein-DNA complexes formed under the same condition as in the gel shift assays with RNE were exposed to UV light, and the protein components cross-linked to the 32P-labeled FAS IRS probe were separated on SDS-PAGE and revealed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4, major proteins cross-linked to the FAS IRS probe migrated at the 49-kDa position, and the free probe itself migrated at about 6 kDa. Subtraction of the probe size (6 kDa) from the cross-linked protein-DNA complex (49 kDa) gave the size of the protein to be 43 kDa, which is consistent with the size of USF1 (43 kDa) and USF2 (44 kDa in mouse and human but probably 42 kDa in rat; see descriptions below). As expected, addition of either FAS IRS itself or AdML promoter, but not poly(dI-dC), in 50- and 100-fold molar excesses to the UV-cross-linking reaction abolished the formation of the 49-kDa signal, demonstrating the specificity of the experiment. We previously showed that in fasting animals transcription of FAS mRNA decreased and that in animals refed a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet the transcription of FAS mRNA dramatically increased. The stimulation of FAS transcription by refeeding is insulin-dependent and insulin administration to streptozotocin-diabetic animals increases FAS transcription(4Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7049-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased circulatory insulin level contributes to the increase of FAS transcription during refeeding. A simple way of regulating FAS transcription by this nutritional manipulation can be achieved by the modification of transcription factors, such as USF1 and USF2, which bind to the FAS IRS. To investigate the possible differences of USF1 and USF2 expression between fasted and refed rat liver, FNEs were prepared. Then gel shift assays of FNEs using FAS IRS as a probe were compared to same assays of RNEs. As shown in Fig. 5, FNEs exhibit a dramatically different pattern of the protein-DNA complexes. In contrast to the existence of Band 1 and 2 formed by RNEs, Band 1 is missing and a faster migrating Band 4 appears. Addition of anti-USF1 and anti-USF2 antibodies to the FNE gel shift reactions resulted in “supershifts” and more importantly, retention of Band 3, which was observed with the RNE (see Fig. 3B). If USF2 in RNEs are different from those in FNEs, addition of anti-USF1 antibodies would not have produced a Band 3 of the same size. For this reason, the property of USF2 present in the protein-DNA complex in Band 3 probably did not change, and the different migration pattern between RNEs and FNEs was likely caused by changes in USF1. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a Western immunoblot analysis of RNE and FNE with anti-USF1 and anti-USF2 antibodies to directly show any differences in USF1 and USF2 in these nuclear extracts (Fig. 6). Equal amounts of protein (80 μg) were applied to a 12% SDS denaturing polyacrylamide gel separation and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes and detected with the two antibodies. Anti-USF1 antibody is directed against the C-terminal 20 amino acids of USF1 and anti-USF2 antiserum is directed against the C-terminal portion of USF2. Anti-USF1 antibody detected two proteins, one at 43 kDa and the other at 17 kDa. The 43-kDa protein (USF1) is in a form of doublet with a minor form at 41.5 kDa. The quantity of the 43-kDa protein is about 4-fold that of the 41.5-kDa protein. While readily detectable in RNE, this 43-kDa doublet is barely detectable in FNE. On the other hand, the 17-kDa protein was readily detected in both nuclear extracts. It seems to be a doublet in FNE and just a single band in RNE. The amount of the 17-kDa protein in FNE is about twice that in RNE. Since the anti-USF1 antibody is against the C terminus of USF1, we thought the 17-kDa protein might be a smaller USF1 containing the C-terminal portion or a USF1-related protein. Anti-USF2 antiserum detected a single major protein at 42 kDa in both extracts. Although the reported size of USF2 from human and mouse is 44 kDa, the size of rat USF2 remains undetermined. Since the anti-USF2 antiserum is highly specific for the detection of USF2,2 we strongly believe that the 42-kDa protein is the rat USF2. In contrast to the 43-kDa USF1, rat USF2 exists in equal amounts in RNE and FNE. The fact that the same amount of USF2 was detected in both nuclear extracts argues against the disappearance of 43-kDa USF1 and the greater amount of 17-kDa USF1-related protein in FNE is caused by general protein degradation during preparation of the nuclear extract. Overall, our data highly suggest that USF1, but not USF2, is regulated during fasting and refeeding, including the amount changes of the 43-kDa USF1 and the 17-kDa USF1-related protein. To investigate whether the 17-kDa USF1-related protein binds to DNA, we carried out a UV-cross-linking experiment with FNEs (Fig. 7). In addition to the 49-kDa signal, as was found with the RNEs, an additional 23-kDa signal was also detected. Both the 49-kDa and 23-kDa signal could be specifically blocked by adding either cold FAS IRS or AdML promoter to the UV-cross-linking reaction, while addition of nonspecific poly(dI-dC) had no effect, demonstrating the specificity of the cross-linking experiment. Subtraction of the probe size (about 6 kDa) from the probe-linked protein size of the small band (23 kDa) gave the molecular mass of the protein to be about 17 kDa, which is consistent with the molecular mass of the small USF1-related protein. Previously, we reported that the first 322 base pairs of the FAS promoter contained the insulin response element by transient transfection of H4IIE hepatoma cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes(6Moustaid N. Sakamoto K. Clarke S. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we mapped FAS IRS to the proximal promoter region from position -71 to position -50 by making chimeric constructions of serial 5′-deletions of the rat FAS promoter ligated to the luciferase reporter gene and transfection into 3T3-L1 adipocytes(7Moustaid N. Beyer R.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5629-5634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This IRS sequence confers about 3-fold increase of the reporter gene activity upon insulin treatment at physiological concentrations. Triple copies of FAS IRS fused to a heterologous SV40 promoter also exhibit insulin response. Since this identification of the cis-acting DNA element mediating insulin response of FAS, we have been making our efforts to identify and isolate the trans-acting factors. In this study, we have demonstrated that USF1 and USF2, which belong to the family of bHLH-LZ transcription factors, are major components of the protein complexes that bind to the E-box contained in FAS IRS. It was previously shown that USF1 can be functionally regulated in a redox-dependent manner(46Pognonec P. Kato H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24563-24567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfhydryl groups of the two cysteine residues, both present within the HLH protein-protein interface domain of USF1 and conserved among all known USF sequences from various species including human(15Gregor P.D.

Biol. 1991; 148: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), are targets of this regulation in the DNA binding capacity, which can be translated into the modulation of USF1's ability to activate transcription(46Pognonec P. Kato H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24563-24567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2 are known to be expressed ubiquitously among various cells and tissues(18Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), based mainly on Northern blot analysis. Distributions of USF1 and USF2 among various tissues and their regulation under different physiological conditions have not been shown previously. In this report, we have demonstrated that USF1 protein in liver of fasted rats is very low and is markedly increased in liver of rats refed a high carbohydrate, fat-free diet. In contrast, USF2 remains at the same concentration in liver of fasted or refed rats. This observation suggests that these ubiquitous transcription factors are regulated at the protein level in response to physiological changes to control downstream gene expression. Structure-function studies of the human 43-kDa USF1 revealed that the HLH and LZ regions are both important for USF oligomerization and DNA binding(15Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Subsequently, transcription activation domain was localized to two regions at the N terminus(21Kirschbaum B.J. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5094-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The first region is between positions 16 and 59 with a core between 26 and 39, and the second is between positions 93 and 156 with a core between 103 and 130 (21Kirschbaum B.J. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5094-5101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This assignment of the functional domains allows us to analyze the possible role of the 17-kDa USF1-related protein, which is detected in rat liver under both fasting and refeeding conditions. There are two possible origins of the 17-kDa USF1-related protein. First, the 17-kDa protein could be a cleavage product of the 43-kDa USF1, or the translation product of an alternative start codon, containing C-terminal amino acids. Since USF sequences show a high degree of sequence conservation almost throughout the entire protein, we used the human USF1 sequence to estimate the amino acids that the 17-kDa rat USF1-related protein might contain. By comparing our 17-kDa protein to the sizes of different portions of human USF1 revealed on SDS-PAGE by Roeder and co-workers(15Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), the 17-kDa rat USF1-related protein was estimated to contain the region from around position 175 to the C terminus, which includes the bHLH and LZ region but not the N-terminal transcription activation domain. In this case, the 17-kDa USF1 still dimerizes with USF2 and bind to DNA, but loses its transactivation function, resulting in no activation of the FAS gene transcription. Regulation of transcription by proteolysis of bHLH-LZ transcription factors, e.g. sterol response element-1-binding protein, has been reported(47Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Since alternative splicing also exists for both human and mouse USF1 and USF2 mRNAs(15Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 18Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the second possibility is that the 17-kDa USF1-related protein is a translation product of an alternatively spliced mRNA. Although the nature of alternative splicing of rat liver USF1 mRNA precursors remains to be studied, the 17-kDa size would not allow the inclusion of the activation, bHLH, and LZ domains at the same time to form a fully functional but “ultra-compact” USF1. In this case, the 17-kDa USF1-related protein is hindered from either proper DNA-binding, USF2 interaction, or transactivation. Rat liver FNE containing the 17-kDa USF1-related protein but not the full-size USF1 (Fig. 6) still shows strong DNA binding activity, and the gel mobility supershift pattern from anti-USF1 and anti-USF2 antibodies are similar to those obtained from RNE (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that the DNA binding and dimerization capability of the 17-kDa USF1-related protein is not severely affected by its smaller size. The existence of a 17-kDa protein, which could be UV-cross-linked to the FAS IRS probe in FNE, reinforces the notion that the 17-kDa USF1-related protein can effectively bind to the E-box in FAS IRS. These observations make the second possibility discussed above the less likely. Nevertheless, the 17-kDa USF1-related protein would not be fully functional in transactivation of the FAS gene. Controlling the proper protein expression level of USF1 and USF2 by pre- and/or post-translational events might be an important mechanism for the cell to regulate transcription of FAS and other E-box-containing genes under different physiological conditions (Fig. 8). Glucose and insulin can regulate a number of glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes. Their effects are dependent on each other in most cases. USFs have been reported to be involved in the glucose stimulation of L-PK and S14 transcription, and the involvement of USF1 and USF2 and their regulation have not been clearly addressed. Here we provide evidence for its binding to the FAS IRS. During fasting/refeeding treatment of animals, both glucose and insulin control glycolytic and lipogenic enzyme expression. Their signal transduction pathways are different, but may converge at some points. Using common transcription factors such as USF may be one such intersection. The specificity of which genes are regulated by glucose and insulin may be contributed by the context of the DNA response element and/or protein interaction of USF with other transcription factors. In the case of rat S14 gene, although mutated glucose response element binds to the same protein complex containing USF in the gel shift assay in a manner indistinguishable from the wild-type glucose response element, it confers no glucose response in vivo(38Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests that other protein components are required to cooperate with USF and determine the glucose response specificity. In respect to the glucose response element sequence 5′-CACGTGNNNGCC-3′, it contains not only the E-box but also the downstream GCC, in which the CC dinucleotide in the E-box context are essential for a specific glucose response(38Shih H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9380-9387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FAS IRS contains the E-box sequence but not the downstream GCC even read from both strands, and the surrounding sequences may specify the insulin response. Further investigation will be necessary to elaborate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the glycolytic and lipogenic enzymes. We thank M. Sawadogo (M. D. Anderson Medical Center, University of Texas) for kindly providing us the USF2 antiserum. We are grateful to Gerald Uyeda for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2069602983,"Basolateral Na-K-Cl cotransport activity in primary cultures of dog tracheal epithelial cells is stimulated by β-adrenergic agents, such as isoproterenol, and by apical UTP, which acts through an apical P2-purinergic receptor. While at least part of the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol appears to involve direct activation of the cotransporter via cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cotransport stimulation by apical UTP is entirely secondary to apical Cl- efflux and a resultant decrease in intracellular [Cl-] ([Cl-]i) and/or cell shrinkage (Haas, M., and McBrayer, D. G.(1994) Am. J. Physiol. 266, C1440-C1452). In the secretory epithelia of the shark rectal gland and avian salt gland, Na-K-Cl cotransport activation by both cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent secretagogues has been shown to be accompanied by phosphorylation of the cotransport protein itself (Lytle, C., and Forbush, B., III(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25438-25443; Torchia, J., Lytle, C., Pon, D. J., Forbush, B., III, and Sen, A. K.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25444-25450). In the present study, we immunoprecipitate the ∼170-kDa Na-K-Cl cotransport protein of dog tracheal epithelial cells with a monoclonal antibody against the cotransporter of the intestinal cell line T84. Incubation of confluent primary cultures of tracheal cells with isoproterenol and apical UTP increases basolateral-to-apical 36Cl- flux 3.4- and 2.6-fold, respectively, and produces similar increases (3.2- and 2.8-fold, respectively) in 32P incorporation into the ∼170-kDa cotransport protein. Decreasing [Cl-]i (without concomitant cell shrinkage) by incubating cultures with apical nystatin and reduced apical [Cl-] ([Cl-]a) likewise increases both cotransport activity and cotransport protein phosphorylation. These effects become more pronounced with greater reductions in [Cl-]a; after 20 min of incubation with nystatin and 32 mM [Cl-]a, cotransport activity and 32P incorporation into the cotransport protein are increased 2.8- and 2.7-fold, respectively, similar to increases seen with apical UTP. 2-3-fold increases in cotransporter activity and phosphorylation are also seen in nystatin-treated cells under hypertonic conditions (50 mM sucrose added apically and basolaterally). These findings suggest a close correlation between Na-K-Cl cotransport activity and phosphorylation of the ∼170-kDa cotransport protein. The latter is phosphorylated in response to both reduced [Cl-]i and cell shrinkage, either or both of which are likely to be involved in secondary cotransport activation in response to apical UTP.

https://openalex.org/W2081384263,"cDNA clones of two novel Ras-related GTP-binding proteins (RagA and RagB) were isolated from rat and human cDNA libraries. Their deduced amino acid sequences comprise four of the six known conserved GTP-binding motifs (PM1, -2, -3, G1), the remaining two (G2, G3) being strikingly different from those of the Ras family, and an unusually large C-terminal domain (100 amino acids) presumably unrelated to GTP binding. RagA and RagB differ by seven conservative amino acid substitutions (98% identity), and by 33 additional residues at the N terminus of RagB. In addition, two isoforms of RagB (RagBs and RagB1) were found that differed only by an insertion of 28 codons between the GTP-binding motifs PM2 and PM3, apparently generated by alternative mRNA splicing.

It is suggested that RagA and RagB are the mammalian homologues of Gtr1 and that they represent a novel subfamily of Ras-homologous GTP binding proteins. INTRODUCTIONRas-homologous GTPases constitute a large family of signal transducers that alternate between an activated, GTP-binding, and an inactivated, GDP-binding state (Hall, 1990; Bourne et al., 1990; Boguski and McCormick, 1993). These proteins represent cellular switches that are operated by GTP-exchange factors and factors stimulating their intrinsic GTPase activity. To date, five subfamilies of the Ras superfamily are known: Ras, Rho, Rab, Ran, and ARF ( 1The abbreviations used are: ARFADP ribosylation factorPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferasebpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate).) proteins. These subfamilies are not only characterized by common structural features but also by a similar function, e.g. regulation of growth (Ras) (Egan and Weinberg, 1993), cytoskeleton organization (Rho) (Aktories et al., 1992), or vesicle transport (Rab and ARF) (Novick and Brennwald, 1993; Kahn et al., 1993). All GTPases of the Ras superfamily have in common the presence of six conserved motifs involved in GTP/GDP binding, three of them as phosphate/magnesium binding sites (PM1-PM3), and the other three as guanine nucleotide binding sites (G1-G3) (Valencia et al., 1991). Therefore, the sequences of the least related GTPases comprise approximately 20-30% identical amino acids, whereas the sequence similarity is considerably higher within subfamilies (e.g. >40% identity in the Rab family, >50% in the ARF family) (Kahn et al., 1992).The application of the PCR method has greatly facilitated the identification of novel cDNAs belonging to larger families of homologous genes, e.g. Ras-homologous GTPases (Chavrier et al., 1992; Clark et al., 1993). Constructing degenerate oligonucleotide primers from the conserved PM1 and PM3 domains, we have previously employed this approach to cloning of novel members of the ARF family (Schürmann et al., 1994; Cavenagh et al., 1994). In addition to the known ARF and several unknown ARF-like isoforms, we isolated a single clone of a cDNA fragment that appeared to encode a GTP-binding protein, but it did not resemble any of the known subfamilies. Here we report the isolation and characterization of full-length cDNAs encoding two novel GTP-binding proteins (RagA and RagB) that, on the basis of structural criteria, constitute a novel subfamily of mammalian Ras-homologous GTPases. RagB is unique among small GTP-binding proteins in that its mRNA is expressed as two splicing variants differing by an insertion of 28 codons within the coding region. Interestingly, this insertion is located between the PM2 motif and the β2 strand, which are presumably involved in nucleotide or effector binding.MATERIALS AND METHODSPCR CloningA domain of 34-40 codons of Ras-homologous GTPases was amplified with degenerate oligonucleotide primers matching the GTP-binding domains PM1 (amino acid sequence LDAAGKT) and PM3 (WDTAGQE) of the ARF family as described previously (Schürmann et al., 1994) with cDNA from murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) as the template. The reaction products were separated on 2% agarose gels and were cloned into pUC18 (Sureclone-kit, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Plasmid DNA was isolated from 200 different clones and was characterized by sequencing or Southern blotting.Library Screening and DNA SequencingPCR products subcloned into pUC18 were isolated with restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamHI and used as probes to screen a rat fat cell λg11 cDNA library (RL1011b, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), a λ-Zap rat brain cDNA library (937502, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and a human λ-Zap fetal brain library (937226, Stratagene). Positive plaques were isolated, and inserts were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). Deletions were generated by exonuclease digestion in both directions, and inserts were sequenced by the method of Sanger (T7 sequencing kit, Pharmacia).PCR Amplification of Fragments Comprising the Alternatively Spliced Domain of RagOligonucleotide primers were constructed that specifically matched the sequence of RagA or RagB in two domains flanking the 84-bp insertion of RagB (RagA-specific primers, 5′-ATT GCG CGC GAC ACC AGG and 5′-T GTC CTG GCC GCC ACA G; RagB-specific primers, 5′-ATT GCC AGA GAC ACA CGT and 5′-T GTC TTG TCC ACC ACA A). Total RNA from rat adrenal gland, brain, thymus, kidney, and spleen was reverse transcribed and used as template. The PCR was allowed to proceed for 34 cycles of 94°C (80 s), 50°C (90 s), and 72°C (90 s). Products were separated on agarose gels, transferred on to nylon membranes, and probed with both RagA and RagB-specific probes. Parallel samples of the PCR products were isolated from the gel, subcloned, and sequenced. In a separate experiment, primers matching the sequence of RagB were used to amplify a large cDNA fragment (bp 685-1765) comprising the insertion, most of the open reading frame and 170 bp of the 3′-untranslated region (forward primer, 5′-TTG CCA GAG ACA CAC CGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCT CAT CTT CTA ACT CC-3′). Two fragments (1 and 1.1 kb) were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced.Northern Blot AnalysisRat tissues (brain, heart, soleus muscle, adipose cells, liver, kidney, spleen, testis, adrenal gland, ovary, thymus; intestine, and lung) were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in 4 M guanidine thiocyanate. The lysates were layered on a cesium chloride cushion (5.88 M) and centrifuged at 33,000 rpm (rotor SW40) for 22 h at 20°C. Pelleted RNA was dissolved with 300 μl of sodium acetate/Tris buffer and was neutralized by the addition of 50 μl of 2 M potassium acetate (pH 5.5). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with reverse transcriptase (First-strand cDNA synthesis-kit, Pharmacia) by oligo(dT) priming. Samples of total RNA (20 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing 6% formaldehyde and transferred on to nylon membranes (Hybond, Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany). Before transfer, gels were stained with ethidium bromide in order to ascertain that equal amounts of total RNA had been separated. Probes were generated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983). The nylon membranes were hybridized at 42°C, and blots were washed twice with 0.12 M NaCl, 0.012 M sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS and once with 0.015 M NaCl, 0.0015 M sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at 55°C.Expression of a Recombinant GST-Rag Fusion Protein in Escherichia coliFragments of the cDNAs of RagA and RagB1 (RagA in pBluescript digested with BamHI/KpnI or NaeI/KpnI; RagB1, digested with HaeIII or NlaIV) comprising the complete reading frames were subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-2TK (Pharmacia). A RagBs cDNA was prepared by deletion of 84 bp from RagB1 by site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) and was subcloned into pGEX. E. coli (DH5α) was transformed with pGEX-RagA, pGEX-RagBs, or pGEX-RagB1, and exponentially growing cultures were induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside and were grown overnight at 28°C. Cells were lysed and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 3 h at 4°C. The beads were washed with PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.3), and the fusion proteins were eluted with buffer containing 10 mM glutathione. Samples of the fusion proteins were separated by HPLC on a Sephasil C-18 reversed phase column (4 × 250 mm, Pharmacia) in order to identify the bound nucleotides as described previously (Tucker et al., 1986).Assay of GTP Binding and ExchangeGuanine nucleotide binding to the GST-Rag fusion proteins was assayed by a previously described procedure (Northup et al., 1982). Samples of 10 μg of fusion protein were incubated with tracer [35S]GTPγS (300,000 cpm/sample) in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in a total volume of 100 μl. Unlabeled GTPγS was added as indicated, and the binding was allowed to proceed at 30°C for 1 h or as otherwise indicated. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 25 mM MgCl2. The samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius GmbH, Göttingen, Germany; pore size, 0.2 μm) and washed 4 times with 1 ml of fresh buffer. Radioactivity on the filters was determined by scintillation counting in a water-compatible scintillation mixture (Ready Protein, Beckman). The exchange of GTP was assayed by loading of recombinant fusion proteins with [35S]GTPγS for 60 min at 30°C, and addition of GTP to a final concentration of 1 mM. Aliquot samples containing approximately 4 μg of protein were separated at the desired time points by filtration as described above.Assay of GTPase ActivityGTPase activity was assayed by a previously described procedure (Tan et al., 1991). Samples of recombinant proteins (25 μg) in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) containing 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM GTP, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin were incubated with 25 nM [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mM) in a total volume of 50 μl at 30°C for 30 min. Free tracer GTP was removed by ultrafiltration in Microcon-10 tubes (Amicon, Witten, Germany), and the samples were again incubated at 30°C. At the desired time points, bound tracer was isolated by filtration on nitrocellulose, and the nucleotides were eluted with formic acid (2 M). Nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine cellulose (1 M lithium chloride, 1 M formic acid) and detected by autoradiography.RESULTSCloning of RagA and RagBA cDNA fragment showing remote similarity with other members of the Ras superfamily (see Fig. 1, underlined sequence) was previously isolated in a PCR-based cloning approach designed to characterize ARF isotypes in 3T3-L1 cells (Schürmann et al., 1994). This fragment was used as a probe to screen a λ-Zap library from rat brain for full-length cDNA clones. Three clones were isolated and characterized. Two of them (sg2-13 and sg2-14, later designated RagA) were identical (1.6 kb), whereas the third (sg2-15, later designated RagB1) was different in size (2.5 kb), intensity of hybridization, and pattern of restriction fragmentation.Sequence of RagAThe nucleotide sequence of the clones sg2-13/sg2-14 contained a poly(A) tail, an open reading frame encoding a protein of 313 amino acids (Fig. 1), and a domain that was nearly identical (one mismatch) to the PCR product that had been used for screening of the library (Fig. 1, underlined). The translation start was assigned to the first AUG codon of the clone. The N-terminal region of the deduced amino acid sequence contains several structural motifs that are conserved within the Ras family (Valencia et al., 1991): the phosphate/magnesium binding motifs PM1 (14-GKSGSGKT), PM2 (42-T), PM3 (61-WDCGGQ), and the guanine-nucleotide binding motif G1 (31-Y). An additional putative guanine nucleotide binding motif G2 (127-HKMD) is strikingly different from those found in all other Ras homologues (NKXD). Moreover, a conserved G3 motif (usually TSA or TCA) is not readily identifiable, the most likely candidates being 156-ECAC and 162-TSI. Finally, it should be noted that the C-terminal domain of the protein, which is probably unrelated to GTP-binding, is considerably larger than that of all other known mammalian members of the Ras family. This domain contains a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids(259-276) that was identified as a putative membrane associated helix by the RAOARGOS program (Rao and Argos, 1986). However, the motif did not fulfil the requirements of the HELIXMEM program (Eisenberg et al., 1984).A human cDNA of RagA was isolated from a fetal brain cDNA library, and its missing 5′-end (132 bp) was completed with the rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure. The nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame was 92.7% identical (not shown), and the deduced amino acid sequence was 100% identical with that of the rat sequence. There was no significant homology in the 5′-untranslated region. Thus, it appears unlikely that the open reading frame extends beyond the presumed translation start.Sequence of RagBThe nucleotide sequence of the clone sg2-15 (Fig. 2) contained a poly(A) tail and an open reading frame of 374 codons. A comparison with RagA revealed that the sequence of the clone (later designated RagB1) was very similar (84% within the reading frame) but differed in an insertion of 28 codons within the reading frame between the nucleotide binding motifs PM2 and PM3 (underlined in Fig. 2, also see alignment in Fig. 3a). In order to test the possibility that two isoforms of the RagB mRNA, with and without the insertion, existed, a large portion of the cDNA including 170 bp of the 3′-untranslated region (bp 685-1765) was amplified by PCR with specific primers. With reverse-transcribed cDNA from testis as template, two cDNA fragments (1 and 1.1 kb) were isolated and subcloned. As anticipated, the sequence of the larger PCR product corresponded with that of RagB1 as isolated from the library (100% identity). The sequence of the shorter fragment was identical except for the 84-bp insertion as depicted in Fig. 2. Thus, there are indeed two isoforms of RagB, RagB1 and RagBs, differing by an insertion of 28 codons between the PM2 and PM3 motifs (see Fig. 5). Because the nucleotide sequences of the two mRNA species are identical except for the insert, we assume that they are derived from the same gene, presumably by alternative mRNA splicing.Figure 2:Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of rat RagB.

Amino acids identical in all Rag isoforms are denoted by asterisks; amino acids identical in the human and rat RagB are designated by periods. Note that the amino acid sequences of human and rat RagA are 100% identical and that only the long isoforms of RagB (RagBs) are given. b, sequence alignment of RagA/Bs with the yeast protein Gtr1. Gtr1 (Bun-ya et al., 1992) was identified as the closest relative of Rag by a data bank search (Swiss-prot, EMBL), and the deduced amino acid sequences of Rag and Gtr1 were aligned with the aid of the PALIGN program. Hyphens represent gaps introduced for optimal alignment (open gap cost, 10; unit gap cost, 2). Amino acid residues differing in RagB are given on top of the RagA sequence.

The domain including the 84-bp insertion of RagB was amplified with oligonucleotide primers specifically matching the sequences of either RagA (A) or RagB (B) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Total RNA from rat thymus (Th), adrenal gland (Ad), spleen (S), brain (B), and kidney (K) was reverse transcribed and used as template. The products were separated on agarose gels, transferred on to nylon membranes, and probed with cDNA fragments of RagA (upper panel) and RagB (lower panel). Co, plasmid DNA of either RagA or RagB1 was used as template.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Based on the comparison with RagA, the translation start of RagB might be assigned to nucleotide 572. However, there is an alternative start codon in RagB at nucleotide 473 that extends the open reading frame by 33 codons. Therefore, a human cDNA clone was isolated and sequenced in order to compare the presumed translation starts. This clone represented the short isoform RagBs (nucleotide sequence not shown); the sequence of the 84-bp insertion was obtained by PCR cloning. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, the open reading frame of the human sequence is homologous to that of the extended rat sequence starting at nucleotide 473, with 27 identical amino acids and five conservative substitutions in the N terminus. Furthermore, the human sequence lacks the second start codon of the rat sequence (methionine 34; Fig. 3a), which corresponds with the translation start of RagA. Thus, it appears reasonable to conclude that the N terminus of RagB is 33 amino acids longer than that of RagA.Except for the extended N terminus and the insertion in RagB1, the deduced amino acid sequences of RagA and RagB were nearly identical (7 conservative substitution, 97.8% identity). Because of this high similarity, the two isoforms were designated A and B (instead of 1 and 2) according to previously established guidelines (Kahn et al., 1992). The identity of the nucleotide sequences was 83.8% within the coding region, but only 51% or less in the 3′-untranslated regions and before the translation start.Homology of Rag with Other ProteinsA data base search was performed in order to determine the degree of homology of RagA/B with other G-proteins and to identify other proteins with structural similarities. The closest related protein was Gtr1 (51.6% sequence identity), a putative GTP-binding protein from yeast that is encoded by an open reading frame near the TUB3 locus on chromosome XIII (Bun-ya et al., 1992). Fig. 3b depicts the alignment of the sequences. Their highest similarity is in the N-terminal half, which comprises the domains responsible for GTP-binding. Both sequences lack a readily identifiable G3 domain; based on the assumption that this domain, if present, should be identical in Rag and Gtr1, the best candidate would be the 162-TSI motif. Except for two isolated motifs, the similarity of the two proteins within the C-terminal domain is low. Thus, it might be predicted that the GTP-binding characteristics of Rag and Gtr1 are similar, but that there are profound differences in the functions conferred by the C termini.The alignment of the first 200 amino acids of RagA/B with prototypes of the five subfamilies of Ras-homologous GTPases revealed that the similarity was low (17.5% identity with Ras, 17.6% with Rho1, 18% with Rab1, 17.5% with Ran, 21% with ARF1, 17% with ARL1; PALIGN program). However, as is illustrated by an alignment of RagB with Ras (Fig. 3c), the GTP-binding domain of Rag is homologous to Ras in order, distance, and structure of the conserved motifs of GTP binding. Based on this similarity, Rag can be assigned to the superfamily of Ras-related GTPases. The alignment also illustrates the position of the insertion in RagB1, which disrupts the PM2 motif and the β2 strand.The low structural similarity of Rag with other members of the Ras superfamily is illustrated by a multiple alignment and the resulting tree (Fig. 4). On the basis of this comparison, it is evident that the Rag isoforms cannot be assigned to any of the known subfamilies. Thus, the proteins appear to represent a novel subfamily of the GTP-binding proteins; we designated them Rag in order to emphasize both their unique structure and the remote similarity with the Ras, Rab, and Ran families.Figure 4:Dendrogram of an alignment of rag with prototypes of the other subfamilies of Ras-homologous GTPases. The dendrogram was constructed with the CLUSTAL program (gap penalty, 5; open gap cost, 10; unit gap cost, 10). Similarities were calculated from the matrix of the pairwise similarity scores.

The products were separated, blotted onto nylon membranes, and hybridized with specific probes. As is illustrated in Fig. 5, a single product hybridizing with the specific probe was obtained with RagA-specific primers; its size corresponded with the product anticipated from the sequence (Fig. 1). With primers specific for RagB, two hybridizing products (109 and 193 bp) were obtained from thymus, adrenal gland, spleen, and kidney. In contrast, brain cDNA yielded exclusively the long PCR product. The identity of the PCR products was ascertained by cloning and sequencing; they corresponded with the sequence of RagB (Fig. 2) and differed indeed in the underlined insertion of 28 codons.Fig. 6, upper panel, illustrates a Northern blot of several rat tissues probed with a cDNA fragment of RagA. A single transcript with an approximate size of 1.8 kb was identified in most tissues with highest levels in adrenal gland; lower levels of mRNA were also detected in brain, skeletal muscle, fat cells, liver, spleen, testis, ovary, thymus, and lung. When a full-length cDNA was used as the probe (data not shown), additional, presumably nonspecific bands appeared; the pattern of tissue distribution of the 1.8-kb band was identical to that shown in Fig. 6. Three different probes derived from the RagB1 cDNA were employed in the Northern blot analysis. Two of these probes (full-length cDNA and 3′-untranslated region) failed to detect any specific signal. With a cDNA fragment comprising a portion of the coding region, two very weakly hybridizing transcripts (2.5 and 3.8 kb) were detected against the background in brain, testis, adrenal gland, and thymus (Fig. 6, lower panel). Thus, the mRNA of RagB appeared much less abundant than that of RagA, and exhibited a somewhat different tissue distribution.Figure 6:Northern blot analysis of the expression of RagA and RagB in different rat tissues. Total RNA from the indicated tissues was hybridized with probes generated from a cDNA fragment of RagA (upper panel; underlined sequence in Fig. 1) or RagB (lower panel; 1.1-kb EcoRI fragment). B, total brain; H, heart; M, skeletal muscle; A, fat cells; Li, liver; K, kidney; S, spleen; T, testes; Ad, adrenal gland; O, ovary; Th, thymus; I, intestine; Lu, lung. As judged from ethidium bromide staining (not shown) the amounts of RNA in each lane were essentially identical with the exception of kidney (partial degradation).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)GTP Binding of Recombinant RagA and RagBIn order to test whether the novel G-proteins do indeed bind GTP, both cDNAs (RagA and RagB1) were subcloned into the expression vector pGEX. In addition, a vector comprising the RagBs cDNA was prepared from the cDNA of RagB1 (clone sg2-15) by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting constructs encoding fusion proteins of GST and the respective Rag isoform were expressed in E. coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified by affinity adsorption on glutathione-Sepharose. HPLC separation of nucleotides bound to the native fusion proteins revealed that recombinant RagA and RagBs were loaded with GTP/GDP to a ratio of 4:1, whereas no bound nucleotides were detected on RagB1 (data not shown). Binding of GTP was then assayed with [35S]GTPγS, and bound GTP was separated by filtration on nitrocellulose. As is illustrated in Fig. 7, upper panel, specific binding of tracer GTPS to the recombinant RagA and RagBs was measurable within 5 min after addition of the ligand, and approached an equilibrium that largely exceeded that"

Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 2697-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Additionally, some pp60v-src is associated with perinuclear membranous structures(7Krueger J.G.

During its intracellular trafficking, v-Src oncoprotein is transiently associated with a constitutive cytosolic 90-kDa heat-shock or stress protein (hsp90) and a second host cell 50-kDa phosphoprotein of unknown function(9Brugge J.S.

Complexation with hsp90 sharply diminishes the intrinsic kinase activity of pp60v-src, and both autophosphorylation of the v-Src protein at tyrosine 416 and phosphorylation of cellular substrate proteins on tyrosine are minimalized until after pp60v-src is attached to the plasma membrane(12Brugge J.S.

The aim of the present study was to further characterize the transient interaction of pp60v-src with hsp90. Specifically, we were interested in the role of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of either hsp90 or pp60v-src in the molecular interactions of these two proteins. Toward this end, we attempted to manipulate the phosphate status of both proteins by treating v-src-transfected cells with okadaic acid (OA), a potent inhibitor of the serine/threonine protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A (see (14Cohen P. Holmes C.F.B. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar) for review). OA has been shown to stabilize the hyperphosphorylation of many cellular proteins, notably retinoblastoma protein and p53(15Yatsunami J. Komori A. Ohta T. Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 239-241PubMed Google Scholar), and to reverse the neoplastic phenotypic characteristics of v-src-transformed 3T3 cells(16Gupta R.W. Joseph C.K. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 320-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Antibodies were as follows: mouse anti-hsp90 mAb (SPA-830; StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, BC), rabbit anti-hsp86 polyclonal antibody (mouse homolog of human hsp90 α; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse mAb and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit mAb (Amersham Corp.), mouse anti-Src protein mAb and OA from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-src clone 327 mAb from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B bead gel was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; Affi-Gel 10 beads were from Bio-Rad. Geldanamycin (GA) was obtained gratis from the Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute (Rockville, MD). Other chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma. Temperature-sensitive v-src-transfected NIH 3T3 cells (TSv-src3T3) were generated by subcloning v-src elements from pSR-XD2 into the expression vector ZipNeo followed by transfection into mycoplasma-free NIH 3T3 cells and were grown as described(17Sartor O. McLellan C.A. Chiueh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21044-21051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with OA (10-100 nM) dissolved in Me2SO for various times (1-24 h); control cells were exposed to the Me2SO solvent. Cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared by scraping cells into 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl buffer, sonicating on ice, and then centrifuging at 100,000 × g. TSv-src3T3 cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed on ice with TNESV lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM orthovanadate) with protease inhibitors: 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were scraped, transferred to microtubes, and cleared of debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as the standard(18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysates were incubated at 4°C with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads to immunoprecipitate protein complexes. In some cases, hsp90-pp60v-src complexes were precipitated with GA beads prepared exactly as described(19Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). GA is a benzoquinone ansamycin that specifically binds to hsp90, and after being coupled covalently to Affi-Gel microbeads, it efficiently precipitates hsp90-pp60-v-src complexes from cell lysates(19Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted from the immune complexes by heating in reducing loading buffer(20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and after fractionating by SDS-PAGE, they were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose or to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking the membranes with 5% fat-free dry milk in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM EDTA buffer, the protein bands were detected by Western immunoblotting followed by chemiluminescence visualization(21Bobrow M.N. Harris T.D. Shaughnessy K.J. Litt G.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 125: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), using a commercial kit (Renaissance™, DuPont NEN). TSv-src3T3 cells were preincubated with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 2 mM glutamine for 2 h. They were then incubated with 0.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (specific activity 370 MBq/ml, 10 mCi/ml, Amersham)/ml of fresh phosphate-free medium for an additional 2 h (2 mCi/100-mm plate), rinsed twice in 0.9% NaCl solution, and lysed in 2 ml of TNESV buffer with protease inhibitors. Aliquots of cleared lysates or lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-src protein mAb, anti-hsp90 antibodies, or GA beads were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radioactive phosphoprotein bands were detected by autoradiography of dried gels. The relative extent of phosphorylation of specific amino acids after OA treatment was determined by labeling cell phosphoproteins with [32P]orthophosphate as described above, followed by immunoprecipitation of pp60v-src and hsp90, separation of coprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to PVDF membranes. Individual radioactive bands were excised and hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl under nitrogen for 2 h at 110°C. Phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on cellulose thin-layer plates exactly as described (22Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 23Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The [32P]phosphate content of the three phosphoamino acids was measured with a PhosphorImager analyzer (Molecular Dynamics), and the intensities of the radioactive spots were measured by integration and corrected for any background signal by computer. TSv-src3T3 cells express a mutant temperature-sensitive RSV pp60v-src protein that, like certain other temperature-sensitive mutants, associates with hsp90 to a greater degree than does wild-type RSV pp60v-src(9Brugge J.S. Erikson E. Erikson R.L. Cell. 1981; 25: 363-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Jove R. Garber E.A. Iba H. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 849-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of this mutant pp60v-src protein from these cells with an anti-src mAb coprecipitated hsp90 (actually hsp84 and hsp86 isoforms in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts), as determined by Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody specific for the hsp90 family of stress proteins (AC88, 830 mAb, StressGen) (Fig. 1, lanes 1-3). The association of hsp90 and pp60v-src was verified by immunoblotting anti-src protein immunoprecipitations with a second anti-hsp90 family antibody, rabbit anti-mouse hsp86 polyclonal antibody (NeoMarkers) (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). Conversely, when hsp90 was immunoprecipitated from TSv-src3T3 cell lysates with the anti-hsp90 monoclonal antibody, the polyclonal anti-hsp86 antibody, or GA-beads, pp60v-src was detected by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 1, lanes 6-8). When primary antibodies against pp60v-src or hsp90 were omitted, or when nonimmune IgG was used in place of primary antibodies, no antigen bands were seen (data not shown). In preliminary experiments, we found that preformed pp60v-src-hsp90 complex did not dissociate when treated with alkaline phosphatase or the serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A (data not shown). We then reasoned an alternative approach to destabilize the complex might be to inhibit cellular phosphatases with OA. Phosphatase inhibition would permit hyperphosphorylation of hsp90 or pp60v-src to occur, which could influence the interaction of the two proteins. To test this possibility, we treated TSv-src3T3 cells with OA prior to immunoprecipitating the complex from cell lysates with anti-src mAb (UBI) or with GA beads. Following separation of the coimmunoprecipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, Western immunoblots for both pp60v-src and hsp90 were performed. OA treatment (2 h) decreased the quantity of hsp90 that coprecipitated with v-Src protein (Fig. 2, lanes 1-4), and likewise the amount of v-Src protein associated with hsp90 precipitated by GA beads was diminished (Fig. 2, lanes 5-8). At the same time, there were no major changes in the total cell levels of either hsp90 or pp60v-src within 2 h of OA treatment (compare bands from lysates; Fig. 2, lanes 10-13). We next examined the effects of OA on the phosphorylation of both pp60v-src and hsp90 proteins. pp60v-src is phosphorylated mainly on serine and tyrosine residues, with a lesser amount of phosphothreonine(25Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar), while hsp90 is constitutively phosphorylated exclusively on serine residues (26Welch W.J. Garrels J.I. Thomas G.P. Lin J.J.-C. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7102-7111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2431-2437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, there was a severalfold increase in the general [32P]orthophosphate labeling of phosphoproteins from cells after exposure to OA (lanes 1 and 2). After immunoprecipitation and separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, we found that OA treatment greatly stimulated the incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into hsp90 in the total pool of immunoprecipitable hsp90 (Fig. 3, lanes 5-8) as well as in the hsp90 that coprecipitated with pp60v-src (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, OA did not significantly increase the radioactivity associated with the total pool of immunoprecipitable pp60v-src (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). However, phosphorylation of the pool of pp60v-src that was complexed with hsp90 was somewhat increased by OA treatment (compare panels B and C in Fig. 4). When the radioactive phosphate content of the fraction of v-Src protein that coprecipitated with hsp90 was normalized to the amount of v-Src protein detected by Western blot, there was an 8-fold increase in [32P]phosphate in the pp60v-src band following OA treatment. This resulted because OA slightly increased the [32P]phosphate content of v-Src protein in the heterocomplex as measured by autoradiography and, at the same time, greatly decreased the quantity of pp60v-src that was associated with hsp90 measured by Western immunoblot.Figure 4Phosphoamino acid analysis of pp60v-src and hsp90 following OA treatment. hsp90 and pp60v-src bands were cut from the PVDF membranes and treated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The locations of unlabeled marker phosphoamino acids on the thin-layer plates were determined by ninhydrin staining and are indicated by the dotted lines. Radioactivity was measured by direct autoradiography and by scanning the plates with a PhosphorImager analyzer (Molecular Dynamics) capable of integrating radioactive areas and correcting for background values (see also Table 1). Shown are phosphoamino acids from control pp60v-srcimmunoprecipitated using UBI anti-src mAb (A), pp60v-src coprecipitated with hsp90 from control cells using the SPA-830 anti-hsp90 mAb (B), and pp60v-src coprecipitated from OA-treated cells with hsp90 using the SPA-830 anti-hsp90 mAb (C). Note that most of the radioactivity resides on phosphoserine in hsp90-associated pp60v-src, while the general pool of pp60v-src is predominantly labeled on phosphotyrosine. D, hsp90 immunoprecipitated from control cells with the SPA-830 mAb; E, hsp90 immunoprecipitated from OA-treated cells with the SPA-830 mAb. It should be noted that the control hsp90 sample (D) includes two bands cut from the PVDF membrane, while the OA-treated hsp90 sample (E) represents only one band. This was done to permit comparison of hsp90 samples with similar radioactivity. The relative positions of the phosphoamino acids from the acid hydrolysates are indicated by PS (phosphoserine), PT (phosphothreonine), and PY (phosphotyrosine), and they are in the same positions in each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated which amino acids were hyperphosphorylated in the two proteins after OA treatment. Cells were exposed to OA for 30 min prior to and during a 2-h labeling period with [32P]orthophosphate, and then hsp90 and pp60v-src were immunoprecipitated, run on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. OA caused marked changes in the phosphoamino acids in both proteins compared with controls. The phosphoamino acid profile shown in Fig. 4A is representative of the phosphoamino acid analysis of the total pp60v-src pool both before and after OA. Phosphotyrosine content in the general pool of pp60v-src was unchanged by OA, as expected, and this was verified by separate anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of the v-Src protein bands (data not shown). In the specific pool of pp60v-src that co-immunoprecipitated with hsp90, the phosphoserine and especially phosphothreonine levels were much higher than in the total pool of immunoprecipitable pp60v-src, and phosphorylation of these residues was slightly increased by OA treatment (Fig. 4, B and C, and Table 1). It should be noted that Table 1 shows the individual phosphoamino acids expressed as percentages of the total phosphoamino acids in each protein sample. As previously reported by Brugge(12Brugge J.S. Yonemoto W. Darrow D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1983; 3: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), there was less phosphotyrosine in pp60v-src complexed with hsp90 than in the total pool of pp60v-src, and phosphotyrosine in hsp90-complexed pp60v-src was decreased further by OA (Fig. 4, B and C, and Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab In contrast to the rather modest changes in the phosphorylation of amino acids in pp60v-src, serine phosphorylation in hsp90 was doubled by OA treatment, and the phosphothreonine content was increased approximately 20-fold (Fig. 4, compare panel D from two hsp90 bands and panel E from one hsp90 band). Expressed as a percentage of the total phosphoamino acid content per sample, phosphothreonine in hsp90 was increased 9-fold by OA (Table 1). Although a trace of phosphotyrosine was found in the hsp90 band (0.7% of total phosphoamino acids), this was not appreciably altered by OA (0.5%) and may have been due to a contaminating, unresolved protein. If the trafficking of newly synthesized pp60v-src to its functional location on the plasma membrane specifically depends upon complexation with hsp90, then disruption of the hsp90-pp60v-src chaperone complex should ultimately result in a decrease in the membrane content of v-Src protein. We tested this concept by preparing cytosolic and membrane fractions from cells treated with OA at 100 nM for various times. These fractions were then directly examined for both hsp90 and pp60v-src levels by Western blotting following separation by SDS-PAGE. Although OA had no measurable effect on pp60v-src levels in either fraction after 2 h (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 4 and 5), OA markedly diminished the amount of membrane-associated pp60v-src after 16 h (Fig. 5, lane 6). The decline in membrane-bound pp60v-src most likely did not result from a decreased synthesis of the protein because cytosolic pp60v-src was unaltered by OA at either 2 or 16 h (Fig. 5, lanes 1-3). hsp90 levels, likewise, were unchanged by OA in either cell fraction (Fig. 5, lanes 1-6). The steady-state level and functional activity of pp60v-src are determined in part by its interaction with the cellular chaperone phosphoprotein hsp90. Any compromise of the integrity of the pp60v-src-hsp90 complex appears to lead to destabilization and loss of the v-Src protein(2Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 3Brugge J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 123: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar, 5Courtneidge S.A. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Because pp60v-src coupled to hsp90 is underphosphorylated on tyrosine (5Courtneidge S.A. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7117-7121Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Brugge J.S. Yonemoto W. Darrow D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1983; 3: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and has greatly diminished kinase activity(5Courtneidge S.A. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7117-7121Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a biochemical/physiologic mechanism must exist for the dissociation of pp60v-src from hsp90 at the appropriate time to permit the normal function of its kinase activity. The data presented in this paper suggest that phosphorylation of either hsp90 or pp60v-src (less likely) might be such a mechanism. This concept is reinforced by our observations that treatment of the pp60v-src-hsp90 complex with various phosphatases did not dissociate the proteins. Brief exposure of cells to the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor OA resulted in a concentration-dependent dissociation of the pp60v-src-hsp90 complex without initially affecting the steady-state constituent level of either protein. However, within 16 h of OA exposure, the steady-state level of membrane-associated, but not the cytoplasmic, v-Src protein was markedly diminished. These data are consistent with destabilization of pp60v-src following disruption or prevention of its association with hsp90(13Xu Y. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7074-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 19Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OA did not affect the phosphorylation status of the total pool of pp60v-src, but the phosphatase inhibitor did moderately increase serine and threonine phosphorylation of the pp60v-src that coprecipitated with hsp90, while decreasing dramatically the amount of v-Src protein that coprecipitated with hsp90. The predominant amino acids that are phosphorylated in pp60v-src are the tyrosine 416 autophosphorylation site (2Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 3Brugge J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 123: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar, 4Parsons J.T. Weber M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar) and the serine 17 residue, known to be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase(28Collett M.S. Erikson E. Erikson R.L. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 770-781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, v-Src protein is also phosphorylated on serine-12 and serine-48 by protein kinase C(29Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Cooper J.A. Buss J.E. Shalloway D. Hunter T. Cell. 1985; 42: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Purchio A.F. Shoyab M. Gentry L.E. Science. 1985; 229: 1393-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All of these phosphoserine residues are within the amino-terminal modulatory domain and close to the membrane-binding domain of pp60v-src. It should be pointed out, however, that Resh and Erikson (31Resh M.D. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have shown amino-terminal phosphorylation sites in pp60v-src to be very labile, presumably because of their susceptibility to phosphoprotein phosphatases. Although the molecular consequences of phosphorylation of pp60v-src at amino-terminal serine residues is not well understood, Jove and Hanafusa (2Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) have suggested that transient phosphorylation within its amino-terminal modulatory domain might regulate pp60v-src kinase activity. Interestingly, Gottesman et al.(32Gottesman M.M. Roth C. Vlahakis G. Pastan I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 2639-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have shown that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of pp60v-src at serine 17 in RSV-transformed cells stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of pp60v-srcin vitro and enhances the tumorigenicity of the transformed cells in nude mice. On the other hand, deletion of serine 17, as well as mutation of serine 12, appears to have little influence on the transforming capability of pp60v-src(33Cross F.R. Hanafusa H. Cell. 1983; 34: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Analysis of several pp60v-src amino-terminal deletion mutants for their ability to stably associate with cellular hsp90 and pp50 suggests that these particular phosphoserine residues are not necessary for the association of pp60v-src with either hsp90 or pp50, although the mutations may negatively influence the stability of the complex(24Jove R. Garber E.A. Iba H. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 849-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of pp60v-src mutant proteins containing amino-terminal deletions, however, are more stably associated with hsp90 than is the wild-type v-Src protein(3Brugge J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 123: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jove R. Garber E.A. Iba H. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 849-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although phosphoserine is present in both the total pool of pp60v-src and in the fraction of pp60v-src associated with hsp90, phosphothreonine appears only in the hsp90-bound v-Src protein (see Fig. 4 and Table 1). These data suggest that threonine phosphorylation in pp60v-src may be necessary for pp60v-src to associate with hsp90. OA treatment appears to only moderately increase the level of v-Src protein phosphothreonine residues (150%). Very little is known about the role of threonine phosphorylation in the regulation of pp60v-src activity (2Jove R. Hanafusa H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 3Brugge J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 123: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar), and the significance of this finding remains to be determined. Both α and β hsp90 isoforms are constitutively phosphorylated by casein kinase II exclusively on serine residues and within a highly charged region of the protein between amino acids 222 and 290(26Welch W.J. Garrels J.I. Thomas G.P. Lin J.J.-C. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7102-7111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dougherty J.J. Rabideau D.A. Iannotti A.M. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A characterization of avian hsp90 purified in the presence of the serine phosphatase inhibitor, fluoride, revealed 6 mol of phosphate/mol of hsp90 dimer; these investigators also suggested that the phosphorylation state of hsp90 could affect its affinities for other proteins to which it binds(35Iannotti A.M. Rabideau D.A. Dougherty J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, double-stranded DNA-activated protein kinase has been reported to phosphorylate two amino-terminal threonine residues unique to the hsp90 α isoform(36Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17275-17280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since our data demonstrate that both α and β hsp90 isoforms are hyperphosphorylated after OA (see Fig. 3), it is unlikely that this particular kinase is responsible for the increased phosphorylation of hsp90 we have observed. Additionally, since both casein kinase II (37Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6460-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and the DNA-activated protein kinase (38Anderson C.W. Lees-Miller S.P. Critical Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1992; 2: 283-314PubMed Google Scholar) are localized within the nucleus, it is unlikely that they could be responsible for our findings, unless the nuclear membrane was damaged. It is more likely that a plasma membrane or cytosolic serine/threonine kinase is responsible for hsp90 hyperphosphorylation following OA treatment. We are presently investigating a number of purified kinases for their ability to phosphorylate hsp90 on threonine and to dissociate preformed hsp90-pp60v-src complexes. From a functional physiologic standpoint, it would be logical for the particular kinase responsible for hsp90 threonine phosphorylation to be localized at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, where it could promote the release of pp60v-src to be anchored to the membrane. The dramatic, 20-fold increase in hsp90 phosphothreonine content following brief OA exposure, compared with the more modest increase in hsp90 phosphoserine, suggests a very robust, specific, and tightly controlled phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle for this amino acid in hsp90. Such a rapid and controlled cycle presumably has essential biological significance. We propose that the level of hsp90 threonine phosphorylation regulates the hsp90-pp60v-src complex stability. This model is similar to one advanced for the regulation of the interaction of retinoblastoma protein with either the adenovirus E1A protein or the cellular E2F-1 transcription factor whereby hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein by cyclin-dependent serine/threonine kinases causes E1A or E2F proteins to release from the complex within the nucleus, allowing for transactivation of genes involved in cell proliferation(39Helin K.

It will be intriguing to determine whether hsp90 hyperphosphorylation on threonine residues caused by OA treatment disrupts other hsp90-protein complexes, such as those formed with the glucocorticoid receptor or the serine/threonine kinase c-Raf-1(41Schuh S.

Perhaps not surprisingly, hsp90 association is required for stability and proper intracellular targeting of c-Raf-1 protein(43Schulte, T. W., Blagosklonny, M. V., Mimnaugh, E. G., Neckers, L. M., Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res., 36, 435.Google Scholar). Preliminary data in our laboratory also suggest that c-Raf-1 protein is, in fact, rapidly depleted from cells following OA treatment, conceivably as a result of OA-induced c-Raf-1-hsp90 complex instability. ( 2Schulte, T. W., and Neckers, L. M., unpublished observation.) In summary, we have shown that brief OA treatment of v-src-infected 3T3 cells results in modest increases in the phosphorylation of serine and threonine in pp60v-src bound to hsp90 and serine residues in hsp90. At the same time, OA stabilizes the hyperphosphorylation of hsp90 threonine residues. Subsequent to these phosphorylation changes, the hsp90-pp60v-src complex is destabilized, and eventually pp60v-src is lost from cell membranes. We propose that a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle, likely involving hsp90 threonine residues, functions as a molecular trigger that initiates the assembly and disassembly of the hsp90-pp60v-src heteroprotein complex, thereby directing the cellular trafficking of pp60v-src and ultimately regulating cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2080010407,"We have used [3H]ryanodine binding experiments and single channel recordings to provide convergent descriptions of the effect of imperatoxin A (IpTxa), a ∼5-kDa peptide from the venom of the scorpion Pandinus imperator (Valdivia, H.

At nanomolar concentrations, IpTxa increased the binding of [3H]ryanodine to skeletal SR and, to a lesser extent, to cerebellum microsomes. The activating effect of IpTxa on skeletal SR was Ca2+-dependent, synergized by caffeine, and independent of other modulators of RyRs. However, IpTxa had negligible effects on tissues where the expression of skeletal-type RyR isoforms (RyR1) is small or altogether absent, i.e. cardiac, cerebrum, and liver microsomes. Thus, IpTxa may be used as a ligand capable of discriminating between RyR isoforms with nanomolar affinity. IpTxa increased the open probability (Po) of rabbit skeletal muscle RyRs by increasing the frequency of open events and decreasing the duration of the closed lifetimes. This activating effect was dose-dependent (ED50 = 10 nM), had a fast onset, and was fully reversible. Purified RyR from solubilized skeletal SR displayed high affinity for [3H]ryanodine with a KD of 6.1 nM and Bmax of ∼30 pmol/mg of protein. IpTxa increased [3H]ryanodine binding noncompetitively by increasing Bmax to ∼60 pmol/mg of protein. These results suggested the presence of an IpTxa-binding site on the RyR or a closely associated regulatory protein. This site appears to be distinct from the caffeine- and adenine nucleotide-regulatory sites. IpTxa may prove a useful tool to identify regulatory domains critical for channel gating and to dissect the contribution of skeletal-type RyRs to intracellular Ca2+ waveforms generated by stimulation of different RyR isoforms.

https://openalex.org/W2170278758,"The induction by dexamethasone of rat liver CYP3A1 differs from classical glucocorticoid gene regulation in part because both glucocorticoids and antiglucocorticoids such as pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN) induce CYP3A1 through transcriptional gene activation. In the present study, we transiently expressed in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes plasmids consisting of CYP3A1 5′-flanking sequences fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid. Deletional analysis identified a 78-base pair (bp) element located approximately 135 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site that was inducible by treatment of the cultures with dexamethasone or PCN and was induced synergistically by dexamethasone plus PCN. Nuclear extract from control rat liver protected two regions within the 78-bp sequence against digestion with DNase I. The same two regions were protected when nuclear extracts from dexamethasone-treated animals were used. Analysis of both of the “footprints” (FP1 and FP2) failed to reveal a classical sequence for the glucocorticoid-responsive element. A 33-bp element that includes FP1 sequences inserted into the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid and transiently expressed in rat hepatocytes conferred a profile of dexamethasone and PCN induction similar to that of the 78-bp element. However, an Escherichia coli expressed glucocorticoid receptor protein failed to protect sequences within FP1 in DNase I footprinting experiments and failed to change its mobility in gel shift assays. Moreover, as judged by the gel shift assay, the specific protein binding to this fragment was the same whether nuclear extracts from the liver of untreated or dexamethasone-treated rats were used. We conclude that the activation of CYP3A1 gene transcription by glucocorticoids may involve proteins already bound to the controlling element in the CYP3A1 gene through a mechanism in which GR in the presence of hormone does not bind directly to CYP3A1 DNA.

INTRODUCTIONCYP3A1, a member of the cytochrome P450 supergene family, is prominently induced in liver microsomes of rats or in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone and, paradoxically, by such antiglucocorticoids as pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN)1(1Elshourbagy N.A.

Studies using isolated nuclei from rats treated with dexamethasone have demonstrated that transcriptional activation of the CYP3A1 gene is the primary mechanism underlying the induction process(6Telhada M.B. Pereira T.M. Lechner M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Simmons D.L. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. J. Biol.

However, detailed pharmacologic analysis of these phenomena in culture disclosed that the time course of induction and the rank order and dose response of synthetic steroid inducers was different for CYP3A1 expression as compared to that for a typical glucocorticoid-responsive gene, tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT)(3Schuetz E.G. Wrighton S.A. Barwick J.L. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1999-2006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, tests of agonist-antagonist relationships demonstrated that rates of de novo synthesis of immunoreactive CYP3A1 protein and accumulation of CYP3A1 mRNA were stimulated synergistically when hepatocyte cultures were incubated in the presence of dexamethasone plus PCN, even though the expression of TAT was inhibited by this same protocol(3Schuetz E.G. Wrighton S.A. Barwick J.L. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1999-2006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids up-regulate TAT by entering the hepatocyte and forming a complex with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). This is followed by binding of the GR to two glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE) located in the 5′-flanking region of the TAT gene, an event that activates TAT gene transcription in a cooperative manner(9Jantzen H.-M. Strahle U. Gloss B. Stewart F. Schmid W. Boshart M. Miksicek R. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 49: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Based on our initial studies, we suggested that the regulation of CYP3A1 by glucocorticoids may proceed by a mechanism that differs from classical GR binding to a GRE that might be located upstream of the CYP3A1 gene(4Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2007-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A possible explanation for our unusual findings was that glucocorticoids and antiglucocorticoids might affect induction of CYP3A1 at different steps in gene expression including post-transcriptional events such as translation or degradation of CYP3A1 mRNA. To investigate the role of CYP3A1 transcription specifically, we established a system for transient expression of 1.5 kilobases of DNA 5′-flanking the CYP3A1 gene2 fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes that maintain synergistic inducibility of hepatocellular CYP3A1 mRNA by dexamethasone plus PCN(5Burger H.-J. Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We found that CAT expression from this transfected CYP3A1 chimeric plasmid was induced by treatment of the cultures with dexamethasone or with PCN and was induced synergistically by treatment with dexamethasone plus PCN while expression of a transfected control plasmid containing the classical glucocorticoid inducible MMTV gene was induced by dexamethasone, was not induced by PCN, and was only slightly induced by dexamethasone plus PCN(5Burger H.-J. Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results establish that the unique features of CYP3A1 regulation by glucocorticoids largely involve effects on CYP3A1 gene transcription. Preliminary analysis of deletions of the 1.5 kilobases of CYP3A1 DNA defined a 165-base pair (bp) fragment approximately 200 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site that maintains dexamethasone and PCN inducibility and PCN synergy when transiently expressed in cultured hepatocytes(5Burger H.-J. Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have exploited the advantages of this culture system to closely define the functional glucocorticoid controlling DNA that flanks the CYP3A1 gene. Finding that the sequence lacks a classical GRE, fails to bind GR, but binds to a pattern of liver nuclear proteins from control or dexamethasone-treated rats that appears the same, we conclude that activation of CYP3A1 gene transcription by glucocorticoids may involve a novel indirect interaction of GR with CYP3A1.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and MaterialsAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) weighing 190-220 g were maintained with free access to animal chow and water for 1-2 weeks prior to use. Collagenase type I was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Freehold, NJ), and all other tissue culture reagents were of the highest grade commercially available from Sigma. Matrigel was prepared from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor(10Kleinman H.K. McGarvey M.L. Hassell J.R. Star V.L. Cannon F.B. Laurie G.W. Martin G.R.

Other reagents were purchased from the following: Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), CAT-ELISA kit (Boehringer Mannheim), Nycodenz (Sigma), and enzymes (Life Technologies, Inc.). Dexamethasone was purchased from Sigma and PCN was a gift from John Babcock (Upjohn). pMMTVCAT (11Cato A.C.B. Miksicek R. Schutz G. Arnemann J. Beato M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 224Google Scholar) was provided by G. Schutz (Institute for Cell and Tumor Biology, Heidelberg, Germany).Preparation of Hepatocytes and DNA TransfectionsPrimary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (13Li D. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes freshly isolated by collagenase perfusion of the livers of untreated rats were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in our standard medium, a modification of Waymouth's MB-752 medium containing insulin (0.1 μM) as the only hormone. For DNA transfection experiments, 0.4 × 106 cells were plated in 35-mm plastic culture dishes (Lux) in 1 ml of medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The cultures were maintained from 24 to 66 h in serum-free Eagle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1 μM insulin. At 66 h each dish of hepatocytes was washed with 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then exposed to a mixture formed by combining 12 μg of Lipofectin with 3.5 μg of DNA (as specified by Life Technologies, Inc.). After 6 h of incubation with the cells, the Lipofectin/DNA mixture was removed and the cultures were incubated with 1 ml of Waymouth's medium containing 300 μg of Matrigel and inducers. Twenty-four h later the medium was replaced with Waymouth's medium containing inducers only. Inducers were added as 1000-fold stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide.Assay of CAT ProteinAfter 48 h of treatment with inducers, cell lysates were harvested and assayed for CAT protein (CAT-ELISA assay, Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, each dish was washed two times with phosphate buffered saline and then incubated 30 min at 4°C in 1 ml of 40 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl to solubilize the Matrigel. This buffer was replaced with 350 μl of lysis buffer (Boehringer Mannheim). Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. CAT protein was measured according to instructions provided with the kit. Total cellular protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid microassay (Sigma). Transfection efficiency in several culture preparations was in the range of 5-10%, and CAT protein measured from duplicate plates varied by less than 10%.Plasmid Constructions and Preparation of Double-stranded OligonucleotidesThe construction of the chimeric plasmid containing the CYP3A1 gene 5′-flanking sequences from -1525 to -56 bp upstream of the transcription start site has been described previously (5Burger H.-J. Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CYP3A1 sequences consisting of 5′ and 3′ deletions were generated by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced (14Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52343) Google Scholar) to confirm the accuracy of the amplification reaction. All CYP3A1 5′-flanking sequences were cloned in the 5′ to 3′ orientation in front of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter of the pBLCAT2 expression vector(12Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 224Google Scholar). Constructions containing these sequences inserted 5′ to the CYP3A1 promoter appeared to support dexamethasone- and PCN-mediated CAT expression when transfected transiently into cultured hepatocytes, but the values were too low to give reliable results. Complimentary oligonucleotides spanning sequences protected against DNase I digestion (FP1, FP2), containing BamHI restriction sites at each end, were synthesized (Macromolecular Resources, Fort Collins, CO), annealed and the double-stranded (ds)-oligonucleotides purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The ds-oligonucleotides were cloned into the BamHI site of pBLCAT2 as single and multiple copies and in both orientations. The FP1 oligonucleotide corresponds to the position -148 to -115 and FP2 oligonucleotide to -116 to -69. The sequence of the upper strands are as follows: FP1, 5′-GGATCCAATAGGCTGTAGATGAACTTCATGAACTGTCTAGGATCC-3′; FP2, 5′-GGATCCTAGGGGAAGAGAGTACCAAAGTCCACGTGAGGCAGAGGTGATCCATCTGGATCC-3′.Treatment of Animals and Preparation of Nuclear ExtractTwenty-one-day-old male, Sprague-Dawley rats were given dexamethasone 21-acetate (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline plus 10% ethanol intraperitoneally at a concentration of 100 mg/kg for 3 h. After treatment, animals were sacrificed, livers removed, and nuclei prepared by centrifugation through Nycodenz(15Graham J.M. Ford T. Rickwood D. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 187: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified nuclei were extracted for proteins with high salt buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 12.5% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.4 M KCl, and the protease inhibitors Pefabloc, leupeptin, and pepstatin A (Boehringer Mannheim). Extracts were dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM Pefabloc, and 0.5 mM DTT, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C until use. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid microassay.DNase I Footprinting AssayThe 165-bp BamHI-HindIII fragment (position -220 to -56) was labeled with 32P at the BamHI site (upper strand). The labeled probe was incubated with 60 μg of crude nuclear extract. Incubations were performed as specified in the instruction manual for the HotFoot footprinting kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After incubation, a partial DNase I digest was carried out by adding 50 μl of DNase I buffer and concentrations of DNase I (Stratagene) from 0.02 to 0.1 unit. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, recovered by ethanol precipitation, and analyzed on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Sequencing of the DNA probe was performed by the Maxam-Gilbert method (16Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8991) Google Scholar) using a sequencing kit from United States Biochemical Corp. An Escherichia coli expressed protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (dbGR, apoT7X556) (17Freedman L.P. Luisi B.F. Korszun Z.R. Basavappa R. Sigler P.B. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Keith Yamamoto, University of California, San Francisco. The footprinting assay using the dbGR was essentially as described for nuclear extracts, except that 600 ng of dbGR was preincubated for 30 min on ice with ZnCl (final concentration, 250 mM) prior to the binding reaction. The MMTV DNA fragment, from -222 to +104 relative to the transcriptional start site, in the 5′ long terminal repeat of the mouse mammary tumor virus was labeled and used as a positive control for GR binding. This fragment contains three regions protected to varying degrees when used in nuclease protection assays employing partially purified receptor (18Miksicek R. Heber A. Schmid W. Danesch U. Posseckert G. Beato M. Schutz G. Cell. 1986; 46: 283-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayThe ds-oligonucleotide, FP1, corresponding to the position -148 to -115, was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. For this assay, 15 μg of nuclear protein were incubated at room temperature for 20 min with 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a binding buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol. The binding reaction was continued for 20 min after addition of labeled oligonucleotide to the reaction. Competitor DNA was added during the preincubation period, prior to addition of labeled oligonucleotide. Gel electrophoresis was conducted using 1 × TBE buffer (0.089 M Tris borate, 0.089 M boric acid, 0.002 M EDTA). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (upper strands) are as follows: FP1, 5′-GGATCCAATAGGCTGTAGATGAACTTCATGAACTGTCTAGGATCC-3′; GRE, 5′-CTAGGCTGTACAGGATGTTCTGCCTAG-3′; NF-κB, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′.RESULTSPreliminary analysis of deletions of chimeric plasmid TKCAT-1525/-56 that contains CYP3A1 sequences from -56 to -1525 relative to the transcriptional start site, previously identified a region of the rat CYP3A1 gene between -220 and -56 that, when transiently expressed in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes, responded to treatment of the cells with dexamethasone or PCN and exhibited dexamethasone plus PCN synergy(5Burger H.-J. Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We noted that -220 to -56 contains neither a classical sequence for the 15-bp GRE (19Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1131-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) nor sequences identical to the consensus sequence, TGTTCT, for “half-sites” in the classical GRE(20Strahle U. Klock G. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7871-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We prepared additional deletion mutants of the chimeric CAT plasmid, TKCAT-220/-56 (Fig. 1), transiently expressed these in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, and measured CAT expression following 48 h treatment of hepatocytes with 10 μM dexamethasone or PCN (Fig. 1). Deletion of sequences between -220 and -176 or between -71 and -56 resulted in no loss of dexamethasone or PCN induction of CAT expression, whereas a further deletion between -176 and -148 resulted in a 2-fold loss of dexamethasone induction. The deletion extending beyond position -56 to -37 bp appeared to reduce CAT expression by PCN treatment, although CAT expression by dexamethasone treatment was not altered. These data suggest the possibility that a negative element lies between -56 and -37. However, the induction by dexamethasone on both the TKCAT-176/-71 (20-fold) and TKCAT-148/-71 (10-fold) constructions was substantial. As shown previously for the TKCAT-220/-56 construction(5Burger H.-J. Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), dexamethasone also produced dose-dependent increases in CAT expression for TKCAT-148/-71 (data not shown). From these results we concluded that the sequences between -148 and -71 are essential for the steroid inductions, although upstream sequences (-176 to -148) may potentiate hormone responsiveness.To examine whether trans-acting proteins bind to the identified CYP3A1 dexamethasone-responsive region, we performed in vitro DNase I footprinting assays. Radioactively labeled CYP3A1 DNA (-220/-56) was incubated with nuclear extracts from control rat liver, and then the mixture was digested with DNase I. The results of these “footprinting” studies showed two regions strongly protected and one region weakly protected against DNase I activity (Fig. 2, lane 3). The reaction was specific because addition of excess unlabeled DNA (-220/-56) was able to compete for binding to both protected regions (Fig. 2, lane 5), whereas the presence of excess nonspecific DNA in the reaction did not compete (Fig. 2, lane 6). Although dexamethasone induction of CYP3A1 in the liver might be expected to alter the pattern perhaps by creating additional footprints, use of nuclear extracts from dexamethasone-treated rat liver in the same experiment produced the identical footprints (Fig. 2, lane 4). Moreover, we found the same footprints when this experiment was carried out with the use of nuclear extracts isolated from untreated and dexamethasone-treated cultures of rat hepatocytes (data not shown).Figure 2DNase I footprint analysis of nuclear protein binding to the CYP3A1 dexamethasone-responsive element. The 32P-labeled CYP3A1 fragment from -220 to -56 (upper strand) was incubated with 60 μg of crude nuclear extract from untreated control and dexamethasone-treated animals. Lane 1, A+G sequence reaction; lane 2, CYP3A1 DNA, no nuclear extract; lane 3, control extract; lanes 4-6, induced extract. Specific binding was determined by competition reactions in which 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled CYP3A1 DNA (-220/-56) (lane 5, +) or nonspecific DNA (lane 6, +) was added prior to addition of labeled CYP3A1 DNA. Sequencing of CYP3A1 DNA (-220/-56) was performed by the Maxam-Gilbert method(16Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8991) Google Scholar). Footprints 1 and 2 (FP1, FP2) are marked by solid lines. The dashed line indicates a footprint possibly due to weak interactions. Base pairs protected are delineated by negative numbers representing distance from the start of transcription.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By alignment with the CYP3A1 DNA (-220/-56) sequence, we determined that the first protected region (FP1) was located from -135 to -117, while the second footprint (FP2) was from -108 to -85 (Fig. 2 and 3A). Thus, within the -220 to -56 DNA probe, both footprints, FP1 and FP2, were found within the 78-bp fragment identified from deletional analysis to be dexamethasone- and PCN-responsive (Fig. 1, TKCAT-148/-71). Close examination of the FP1 sequence (Fig. 3B) finds 8 bp in common with a 12-bp consensus GRE (19Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1131-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and 4 of 5 nucleotides suggested as critical for GR binding(21Nordeen S.K. Suh B.J. Kuhnel B. Hutchison III, C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The FP1 sequence also contains a palindromic sequence (underlined), ATGAACTTCAT, that overlaps one of two “direct repeats” of ATGAACT separated by 2 nucleotides (Fig. 3C). A 6-bp portion of these 7-bp repeated sequences, TGAACT, when examined on the lower strand (AGTTCA), is a DNA motif representing a high affinity binding site for several types of nuclear receptors including the peroxisome proliferator activator (22Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar) and the retinoic acid receptors(23Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). The CYP3A1 gene is not regulated by peroxisome proliferators or retinoic acids, thus emphasizing that a DNA binding site identified by sequence analysis is not necessarily functional. In addition, we identified a sequence at the 3′ end of FP2 similar to that of an AP1 binding site (24Fisher R.C. Thorley-Lawson D.A. Mol. Cell.

When the ds-oligonucleotides were cloned into pBLCAT2 and transiently expressed in hepatocytes, only sequences spanning the area protected by FP1 (TKCAT-148/-115) were responsive to dexamethasone and PCN (6- and 3-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4A). The magnitude of the response of the FP1 containing construction to dexamethasone was comparable to the endogenous hepatic levels of CYP3A1 transcriptional activation by dexamethasone as demonstrated by nuclear run-on transcription assays(6Telhada M.B. Pereira T.M. Lechner M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Simmons D.L. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. J. Biol.

When placed in the opposite orientation, i.e. 3′ to 5′, this -148/-115 ds-oligonucleotide mediates a similar level of CAT induction; however, multiple copies of this sequence did not increase CAT induction over and above the results with a single copy (data not shown). Thus, this single 33-bp element is able to confer both dexamethasone and PCN induction on CYP3A1 gene expression in cultured hepatocytes, although sequences flanking this element may be important in the modulation of responsiveness, as indicated by an increase in CAT induction when sequences from -148 to -176 are included.Figure 4Transient expression in cultured hepatocytes of CYP3A1 5′-flanking sequences encompassing FP1 and FP2. A, ds-oligonucleotides corresponding to -148/-115 (contains FP1) and -116/-69 (contains FP2) were cloned 5′ to TKCAT and transiently expressed in rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were treated with dexamethasone (10 μM) or PCN (10 μM). Footprint sequences are underlined.

This study demonstrates that the IL-2 receptor β (IL-2Rβ) chain is the critical receptor component required to mediate this effect. The use of IL-2Rβ chain deletion mutants transfected into a Ba/F3 murine cell model describes a requirement for the IL-2Rβ “acid-rich” domain between amino acids 315 and 384 for Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and receptor association. COS cell co-transfection studies of IL-2Rβ chain constructs containing point mutations of tyrosine to phenylalanine along with the tyrosine kinase Jak-1 and a hemagglutinin-tagged Shc revealed that the motif surrounding phosphorylated tyrosine 338 within the acid-rich domain of the IL-2Rβ is a binding site for Shc. Deletion of this domain has previously been shown to abrogate the ability of IL-2 to activate Ras but does not affect IL-2-dependent mitogenesis in the presence of serum. Proliferation assays of Ba/F3 cells containing IL-2Rβ chain deletion mutants in serum-free medium with or without insulin shows that deletion of the acid-rich domain does not affect IL-2-driven mitogenesis regardless of the culture conditions. This study thus defines the critical domain within the IL-2Rβ chain required to mediate Shc binding and Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and further shows that Shc binding and phosphorylation are not required for IL-2-dependent mitogenesis. Neither serum nor insulin is required to supplement the loss of induction of the Shc adapter or Ras pathways, which therefore suggests a novel mechanism for mitogenic signal transduction mediated by this hematopoietin receptor.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) ( 1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinIL-2RIL-2 receptorHAhemagglutininPASprotein A-Sepharose.) is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to affect the physiology of cells of immune and nonimmune tissue (reviewed in (1Gaulton G.N. Williamson P. Chem. Immunol. 1994; 59: 91-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) by direct interaction with a high or intermediate affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). The high affinity IL-2R (Kd = 10-11) is composed of three receptor subunits (reviewed in (2Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)); α (55 kDa), β (75 kDa), and the common γ chain (γc, 64 kDa), which is shared by several hematopoietic cytokine receptors(3Leonard W.J. Noguchi M. Russell S.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 365: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The intermediate affinity receptor (Kd = 10-9) is a β-γc complex only(2Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signal transduction by IL-2 minimally requires the intermediate affinity β-γc receptor complex and does not require the α chain(2Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 245-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the apparent function of the α chain is to affect IL-2 affinity only and not the mechanism of IL-2 signal transduction. interleukin IL-2 receptor hemagglutinin protein A-Sepharose. Signal transduction by IL-2 is initiated by the activation of several tyrosine kinases associated with specific receptor molecules of the IL-2R. Among these are members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, which have been shown to functionally couple to the IL-2Rβ chain (4Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A. Levin S.D.

The first detectable event following treatment of T cells with IL-2 is the formation of an activated α-β-γc IL-2R complex containing tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated Jak-1 and Jak-3(7Russell S.M.

A. 1992; 89: 2674-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates. Among the proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-2 is the recently identified protein Shc(12Burns L.A. Karnitz L.M. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17659-17661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Shc is an SH2 domain containing protein found as two dominant, widely expressed, and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of 52 and 46 kDa as well as a 66-kDa protein with more restricted expression(13Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Carallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Shc functions to link receptor tyrosine kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation to the downstream activation of Ras and Ras-like pathways (reviewed in (14Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar)) and accomplishes this by recognizing and binding to a phosphotyrosine-containing motif within the receptor or a receptor-associated protein. Binding to the receptor complex brings Shc into proximity for phosphorylation by an activated tyrosine kinase and establishes a secondary “docking” site for the protein Grb2(15Rozakis-Adocock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas A. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The subsequent binding of Grb2 to the receptor complex brings guanine nucleotide releasing factor activity, such as Sos (16Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) or Vav(17Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12629-12633Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), to the membrane where it can catalyze the release of GDP from inactive Ras-GDP, allowing the formation of an activated Ras-GTP complex. Thus it is clear that the activation of Ras via the Shc/Grb2 adapter pathway is dependent on the ability of Shc to recognize and bind to a tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor complex. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p52Shc and activation of the Shc/Grb2 adapter pathway can be induced by a number of mitogenic cytokines and growth factors(13Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30911-30916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As in other systems, Shc has been found associated with the IL-2R complex (25Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1599-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the induction of this pathway by IL-2 has been reported to correlate with the ability of IL-2 to elicit a mitogenic response(26Zhu X. Suen K. Barbacid M. Bolen J.B. Fargnoli J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5518-5522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this and the multi-protein nature of the IL-2R complex, we were interested in determining the precise mechanism by which IL-2 stimulates Shc/receptor binding and tyrosine phosphorylation. Human T cells were obtained from normal donors and isolated by counter flow centrifugal elutriation (27Wahl L.M. Katona I.M. Wilder R.L. Winter C.C. Haraoui B. Sher I. Wahl S.M. Cell Immunol. 1984; 85: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Isolated T cells were activated and cultured for 3 days in RPMI media (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Intergen), 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin, glutamine, and antibiotics(28Evans G.A. Wahl L.M. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cells were recovered and G1-enriched (28Evans G.A. Wahl L.M. Farrar W.L. Biochem.

Cells were treated with 100 nM recombinant human IL-2 or IL-4 (Peprotech) for up to 30 min as described(29Evans G.A. Garcia G.G. Erwin R. Howard O.M.Z. Farrar W.L. J. Biol.

Ba/F3 cells transfected with various IL-2Rβ chain deletion mutants (FL, AD, BD, SD, and BS) were maintained at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% WEHI-3B culture supernatant(30Ihle J.N.

IL-2 treatments were performed on these cells using 100 nM recombinant IL-2 at a cell density of 50 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 15 min, recovered by centrifugation, and prepared for lysis and immune precipitation. Constructs containing IL-2Rβ chain deletion mutations were prepared as described(31Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem.

The Jak-1 expression plasmid was prepared by subcloning the 4.2 kB murine Jak-1 cDNA (provided by O. Silvennoinen and J. Ihle) into the SalI/SmaI sites of pCMV4Δ (provided by M. Feinberg). A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged derivative of human Shc (containing two tandem copies of the sequence YPYDVPDYD at the 5′ end) was prepared by polymerase chain reaction, and the 1.6-kilobase pair cDNA was subcloned into the HindIII/KpnI sites of the expression plasmid pCMV4Neo (provided by M.

Anti-Shc immune precipitation of Ba/F3 cells was performed using a 300 × 106 cell lysate equivalent and 4 μl of anti-Shc antibody/sample. All immune precipitations were performed for 4 h to overnight at 4°C in the presence of 20 μl of protein A-conjugated Sepharose (Sigma). Immune precipitations were washed 6 times in lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in 50 μl of 2 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and probed using anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. IL-2Rβ immune precipitation was performed using anti-IL-2Rβ monoclonal antibody 561 (provided by R. Robb) directly conjugated to protein A-Sepharose (PAS). Preparation of 561-PAS was initiated by incubating 1 mg of 561 with 1 ml of packed PAS beads in 3 ml of lysis buffer overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, 2 times with 0.1 M borate, pH 9.0 (BB) and resuspended in 10 mls of BB. Dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma) was added to 20 mM, and beads were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. 561-PAS was washed once with BB, resuspended in 40 mM ethanolamine pH 8.0, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were washed several times with alternating cycles of BB and 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0. 561-PAS was resuspended at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml 561/packed beads in phosphate-buffered saline, supplemented with 0.1% sodium azide, and stored at 4°C. For IL-2Rβ chain immune precipitations, treated Ba/F3 cells containing mutant IL-2Rβ chains or transfected COS-7 cells were lysed, clarified as described, and immune precipitated using 30 μl of 561-PAS (30 μg of antibody equivalent). Immune precipitations were incubated for 4 h at 4°C and washed six times with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling in 50 μl of nonreducing 2 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (no β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed and adjusted to 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and probed for Shc or Shc-HA by anti-Shc or anti-HA immunoblotting. All immunoblotting was performed as described (34Rui H. Djeu J.Y. Evans G.A. Kelly P.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24076-24081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the following antibodies. For the detection of changes in tyrosine phosphorylation, immune precipitated samples on polyvinylidene difluoride paper were probed using 1 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Anti-Shc immunoblotting was performed using 1 μg/ml polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Anti-HA immunoblotting for the detection of hemagglutinin-tagged Shc was performed using polyclonal anti-HA tag antibody (BABCO). Anti-IL2Rβ chain immunoblotting was performed using 1 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 561. All immunoblots were developed using the ECL developement kit following the manufacturer's direction (Amersham Corp.) Ba/F3 cells containing various IL-2Rβ chain deletion mutants were cultured as described above and obtained 2 days after feeding. Cells were washed two times in QBSF-56 medium (Quality Biologicals Inc.), plated in 96-well culture plates at 5000 cells/well in QBSF-56 medium with or without insulin (Quality Biologicals Inc.), and supplemented with glutamine and antibiotics. Cells were treated with 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-2 and cultured for 24 h at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Cells were then pulsed with [3H]thymidine for 6 h, and proliferation was quantitated as described(35Mills G.B. Cragoe E.J. Gelfand E.W. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5518-5522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2 has been shown to induce Shc association with the IL-2 receptor complex (25Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1599-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc(12Burns L.A. Karnitz L.M. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17659-17661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activate Ras in human T cells(36Satoh T. Nakafuka M Miyajima A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). For these reasons we were interested in determining the mechanism by which IL-2 induces Shc phosphorylation leading to activation of the Shc adapter pathway. The IL-2 receptor complex contains four dominant tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins: the IL-2Rβ chain, the common γ chain, and the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases Jak-1 and Jak-3. To determine which of these phosphotyrosine containing proteins was most important in mediating Shc phosphorylation we used the IL-4 receptor system, which also contains the common γchain and activates Jak-1 and Jak-3(7Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), and asked whether IL-4 was capable of inducing Shc phosphorylation in a manner similar to that observed with IL-2. Activated human T cells were treated with IL-2 or IL-4 and assayed for receptor tyrosine kinase activation, as represented by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-3, and factor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. This analysis clearly demonstrates that IL-4 does not induce Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in spite of inducing receptor tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation of Jak-3 in human T cells (Fig. 1). This observation is supported by additional results that describe an inability of IL-4 to induce Shc tyrosine phosphorylation in other cell types(37Welham M.J. Duronio V. Leslie K.B. Bowtell D. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21165-21175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This therefore implies a direct role for the IL-2Rβ chain in controlling IL-2-dependent Shc phosphorylation. Previously generated and characterized IL-2Rβ molecules containing various deletion mutations within the cytoplasmic domain (31Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) were transfected into murine IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells and analyzed for their ability to support IL-2-induced receptor tyrosine kinase activation and substrate phosphorylation leading to mitogenesis (summarized in Table 1). As previously reported, only wild type (FL), acid-rich domain deletion mutants (AD), and truncation deletion mutants from amino acid 384 to the carboxyl terminus (BD) were capable of supporting IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and mitogenesis (Table 1 and (31Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). We next asked whether there was a difference in the ability of these mutants to transduce IL-2-dependent signal leading to Shc phosphorylation. Receptor-containing Ba/F3 cells were treated with IL-2 and assayed for IL-2-induced Shc phosphorylation by anti-Shc immune precipitation followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3, the wild type receptor (FL) and the BD mutant, containing an intact acid-rich domain, were capable of inducing IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. Deletion of this domain in the AD receptor resulted in an inability to transduce signal leading to Shc phosphorylation (Fig. 3). As a control, IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of murine Jak-3 and downstream substrates was verified in all three mutant receptor-containing cells ((31Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and data not shown). SD- and BS-containing cells were incapable of inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc or Jak-3 (data not shown), supporting previous observations(31Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This analysis suggests that a domain within the acid-rich region of the IL-2Rβ is required to mediate IL-2-dependent Shc phosphorylation and may represent a binding site for Shc.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Figure 3IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc requires the IL-2Rβ acid-rich domain. Ba/F3 cells containing FL, AD, or BD receptors were treated with (+) or without(-) IL-2 for 15 min, lysed, and immune precipitated with anti-Shc antibody. Relative tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was determined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot of anti-Shc immune precipitates. The position of p52Shc is indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FL-, AD-, and BD-containing cells were treated with IL-2, the IL-2Rβ chain was immune precipitated, and an immunoblot was performed using an anti-Shc antibody. Results from this experiment show an IL-2-dependent association of Shc with FL and BD receptors but not in cells containing the AD mutant (Fig. 4). This clearly shows that IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc involves direct binding of Shc to a motif within the acid-rich domain of the receptor and implies a requirement for IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of this region as a prerequisite for Shc association. There are six tyrosines within the IL-2Rβ chain cytoplasmic domain that upon phosphorylation may serve as binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins such as Shc (Fig. 5). Four of these are found within the acid-rich domain. To further clarify which of these phosphotyrosine-containing motifs is involved in mediating Shc binding, COS cells were co-transfected with a hemagglutinin-tagged Shc (Shc-HA) construct, wild type IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rβ constructs containing point mutations of tyrosine to phenylalanine, and a construct encoding the tyrosine kinase Jak-1; co-transfection of these constructs results in tyrosine phosphorylation of each of the IL-2Rβ cytoplasmic tyrosine residues in this assay (data not shown). Following transfection and culture, the IL-2Rβ chain was immune precipitated, and Shc association was determined by immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody. Two conclusions can be drawn from an analysis of the results of a co-transfection experiment of this type presented in Fig. 6. First, Shc is found associated with the IL-2Rβ only in the presence of expressed Jak-1 (Fig. 6, upper panel, and data not shown). This supports our previous observations, which have suggested that IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the β chain is a prerequisite for Shc association. Additionally, this analysis shows that phosphorylated tyrosine 1 at amino acid position 338 within the cytoplasmic domain is required for Shc association (Fig. 6, upper panel). In all transfections, equivalent expression of the IL-2Rβ chain and Shc-HA was confirmed by immunoblot with specific antibody (Fig. 6, middle and lower panel).Figure 6IL-2Rβ point mutations of tyrosine to phenylalanine establish the motif surrounding phosphorylated tyrosine 338 as the IL-2Rβ Shc binding site. COS-7 cells were transfected with constructs containing Shc-HA, Jak-1, and/or wild type IL-2Rβ chain (βWT) or tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of the IL-2Rβ chain containing only tyrosine 338 (βYF:1Y), tyrosines 355, 358, and 361 as a group (βYF:234Y), tyrosine 392 (βYF:5Y), or tyrosine 510 (βYF:6Y). Cells were cultured, lysed, and immune precipitated with antibody 561 and probed for Shc-HA association using anti-HA immunoblot (upper panel). To verify equivalent expression in transfected cells, lysates were subjected to anti-HA immunoblot (middle panel) or anti-β chain immunoblot using antibody 561 (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous analysis has suggested that the acid-rich domain of the IL-2Rβ chain is required for IL-2-dependent Ras activation(38Satoh T. Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Kawahara A. Taniguchi T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25423-25427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results support these observations and further suggest that Shc phosphorylation and Ras activation are not required for IL-2-induced mitogenesis in the presence of serum-containing medium. This is suggested by the ability of the AD receptor mutants to support IL-2-dependent growth but fail to allow IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc ((38Satoh T. Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Kawahara A. Taniguchi T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25423-25427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Fig. 3). This observation is in sharp contrast to several reports that have clearly shown that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and downstream activation of Ras are closely coupled to ligand-induced mitogenesis (14Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar, 39Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For example, mutant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors that do not signal through Ras pathways have been shown to require serum for granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced proliferation(39Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The addition of serum in this system results in supplemental Ras activation such that these cells can now respond mitogenically to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor(39Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To determine whether serum supplementation is required for IL-2-induced mitogenesis of Ba/F3 cells containing the AD receptor mutant, the proliferative response to IL-2 in wild type (FL) and AD-containing cells under serum-free conditions in the presence or the absence of insulin was analyzed. Although we have previously described minor differences in the IL-2-induced proliferative response of FL and AD receptor-containing cells(31Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these results show that FL and AD mutants support increased DNA synthesis (Fig. 7) as well as increases in cell number (data not shown) in response to IL-2 in both serum-free and insulin-free conditions. Although mitogenesis is enhanced in the presence of insulin in these cells, there is no significant difference between FL and AD receptors. The AD mutants fail to activate Ras (38Satoh T. Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Kawahara A. Taniguchi T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25423-25427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fail to activate the Shc adapter pathway, which may result in the activation of other Ras-like pathways, but are capable of supporting IL-2-induced mitogenesis in the presence of serum or in serum-free and insulin-free conditions in a manner similar to that observed with the wild type FL receptors. These results thus suggest that IL-2 signal transduction leading toward mitogenesis does not require Shc phosphorylation or the activation of Shc/Grb2 or Ras pathways(38Satoh T. Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Kawahara A. Taniguchi T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25423-25427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using mutational analysis of the IL-2R system, we have shown that IL-2 induction of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation is dependent on Shc association with the IL-2Rβ. We further show that this association is dependent on the presence of phosphorylated tyrosine 1 at amino acid 338 within the acid-rich region of the IL-2Rβ cytoplasmic domain. This tyrosine is found within a motif containing the sequence TNQGpYFFF. Structural studies of motifs required for Shc binding to various receptor complexes (40Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T.

Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), also referred to as the SAIN (Shc and IRS-1 NPXY binding) domain (42Gustafson T.A. Weimin H. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) of NPXpY. Considering the structural similarities between proline and glutamine, the motif within the IL-2Rβ chain of NQGY appears quite similar to the predicted SAIN domain recognition consensus of NPXY. Using the predicted IL-2 receptor binding domain for Shc, NQXY, a search was initiated for proteins containing this motif(43Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar). Generally, this search identified proteins that have been shown to have regulatory functions in various signal transduction pathways including Ras-Gap (motif from amino acid 178PTNQWYH-), which is involved in the regulation of Ras and Ras-like pathways, and several receptor molecules such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor (motif from amino acid 761TSNQEYL-). Experiments aimed at investigating the potential role that Shc association with these and other proteins may play in regulating signal transduction are presently underway. It has been shown (31Howard O.M.Z. Kirken R.A. Garcia G.G. Hackett R.H. Farrar W.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Satoh T. Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Kawahara A. Taniguchi T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25423-25427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that deletion of the acid-rich region of the IL-2Rβ chain abrogates the ability of IL-2 to induce Ras activation as well as increased transcription of fos and jun but did not affect IL-2-dependent mitogenesis in the murine IL-3-dependent cell Ba/F3. This analysis did not preclude the possibility of IL-2-dependent activation of Ras-like but Ras-distinct pathways, which would support IL-2-driven cell growth. By focussing on the analysis of IL-2 activation of upstream Ras pathway regulators (Shc adapter pathway), it becomes much easier to define the potential role that these pathways play in IL-2 signal transduction. Results from this study clearly show that Shc phosphorylation that acts to initiate this pathway is not required for mitogenesis. This analysis does not preclude the possibility that Grb2 may interact directly with this receptor complex and function to activate other guanine nucleotide releasing factor activities in the AD mutant, which may lead to mitogenesis. If this were the case, however, one would expect AD receptors to also activate Ras. This clearly does not occur in this mutant(38Satoh T. Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Kawahara A. Taniguchi T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25423-25427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, in the insulin receptor system, which has been shown to associate independently with both Shc and Grb2, Shc binding and tyrosine phosphorylation is the primary mechanism utilized in vivo to bring Grb2 and guanine nucleotide releasing factor activity to the membrane resulting in Ras activation(44Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data thus suggest that Shc binding to the IL-2Rβ chain, which results in its tyrosine phosphorylation and initiation of the Shc/Grb2 adapter pathway, is the mechanism used by IL-2 to activate Ras and Ras effector pathways. These data also strongly suggest that IL-2 receptor signal transduction functions to activate specific mitogenic signals without a strict requirement for Ras in IL-2 receptor-containing Ba/F3 cells. This does not preclude the possibility, however, that in the context of a different cellular background IL-2 may have different requirements for Ras and Ras signaling pathways. It is well described that Ras activation and regulation of downstream pathways is critical in controlling proliferation(14Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar). It seems plausible therefore that mitogenic signal transduction by IL-2 in Ba/F3 cells may activate one or more of these downstream pathways by functionally bypassing Ras activation. A key mitogenic pathway activated by upstream activation of Ras is the Raf/Map kinase cascade (45Troppmair J. Bruder J.T. App H. Cai H. Liptak L. Szeberenyi T. Cooper G.M. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1867-1873PubMed Google Scholar, 46Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This pathway has been described as a “mitogenic bottleneck” due to the wide variety of mitogenic signals that funnel into Raf activation (46Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and because antisense elimination of Raf blocks cytokine-triggered mitogenesis(47Muszynski K.W. Ruscetti F.W. Rapp U.R. Heidecker G. Gooya J. Keller J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). IL-2 has been shown to activate Raf, and Raf has been found to be associated with the IL-2 receptor complex by ourselves (data not shown) and others(48Turner B.C. Tonks N.K. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5544-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 49Wlodzimierz M. Remillard B. Tsudo M. Strom T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15281-15284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-2-dependent activation of Raf involves a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism(48Turner B.C. Tonks N.K. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5544-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As has been shown in other systems, this is presumed to involve the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, the subsequent activation of Ras, and the downstream activation of Raf and Map kinases(14Pronk G.J. Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 131-147PubMed Google Scholar, 46Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). However, Raf can also be activated by direct tyrosine phosphorylation(50Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A. Rapp U.R. Roberts T.M. Williams L.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The possibility exists, therefore, that IL-2 signaling may involve the direct tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf as an activating mechanism. This would theoretically abrogate the requirement for Ras activation in an IL-2-driven mitogenic response. To further elucidate this, the role that Raf activation plays in IL-2 signal transduction in IL-2 receptor mutants is being investigated. With the data presented here, a potentially novel mechanism by which IL-2, and perhaps other IL-2Rβ chain containing receptors, controls cell growth is being established. In contrast to the results presented from studies within the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor system(39Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which clearly establishes an absolute requirement for some level of Ras activation in order for this receptor system to support cytokine-induced mitogenesis, the model of IL-2 signal transduction that has been generated in Ba/F3 cells establishes that mitogenesis can be fully supported by IL-2 receptors that lack the ability to activate this or similar pathways through utilization of the Shc adapter pathway. IL-2 signal transduction thus forms a novel paradigm for mitogenic signaling by hematopoietic cytokines."

Nieuwenhuizen W. Van Deenen L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 159: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the presence of this sPLA2 in several non-digestive tissues has been demonstrated(9Seilhamer J.J. Randall T.L. Yamanaka M. Johnson L.K.

It is secreted by a large number of cell types in which its expression is strongly up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines. Its concentration in various extracellular fluids is dramatically increased in several inflammatory diseases. Moreover, this enzyme has potent proinflammatory activities(21Bomalaski J.S. Lawton P.

Besides their role in prey digestion, the snake venom sPLA2s can have neurotoxic, myotoxic, anticoagulant, and proinflammatory effects(22Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kim J. Fornasier V. Am. J.

Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). They are apparently involved in their biological effects. A first type of sPLA2 receptors called N-type sPLA2 receptors (for neuronal) has been initially identified in rat brain (26Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then in other tissues (28Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. Neurochem. Res. 1991; 16: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using OS2, a novel neurotoxic sPLA2, purified from the Taipan snake (Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus) venom(26Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It recognizes several other neurotoxic sPLA2s with high affinity while non-neurotoxic venom sPLA2s display much lower affinities. A second type of sPLA2 receptor called M-type sPLA2 receptor has been initially characterized in rabbit skeletal muscle(27Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using OS2 and OS1, another sPLA2 purified from the Taipan snake venom(26Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very interestingly, this receptor binds the porcine pancreatic sPLA2 as well as the human inflammatory sPLA2 with high affinities (30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these endogenous sPLA2s might be its physiological ligands. M-type sPLA2 receptors were subsequently characterized in fibroblasts and other tissues using the porcine pancreatic sPLA2 as a ligand(14Arita H. Hanasaki K. Nakano T. Oka S. Teraoka H. Matsumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19139-19141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hanasaki K. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6414-6420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the M-type sPLA2 receptor has been cloned in rabbit, bovine, and human species(30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cloned receptors are homologous to the macrophage mannose receptor, a protein involved in the endocytosis of glycoproteins and microorganisms(35Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D.

Swiggard W.J. Heufler C. Peng M. Mirza A. Steinman R.M. Nussenzwelg M.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of these proteins, which may constitute a new family of receptors, are predicted to share the same structural organization, i.e. a large extracellular region composed of an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a fibronectin-like type II domain, eight(30Lambeau G.

This latter domain contains a consensus sequence for the internalization of ligand-receptor complexes and is thought to confer to these receptors their endocytic properties(30Lambeau G. Ancian P.

The purpose of this paper is to identify by site-directed mutagenesis techniques the specific domain in the large extracellular part of the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor (1394 residues) that is responsible for the binding of sPLA2s. OS1 and OS2 were purified as described previously (26Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the venom of O. scutellatus scutellatus. p-Aminophenyl-α-D-mannopyranoside-BSA (mannose-BSA, A4664) was purchased from Sigma. M-type sPLA2 receptor mutants were obtained by the methyl-dCTP method (39Vandeyar M.A. Weiner M.P. Hutton C.J. Batt C.A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) using as template the cDNA encoding for the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor subcloned into the expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). The template used in mutagenesis experiments was shortened in the 3′-non-coding region by removing 713 base pairs between 2 SexAI sites located at positions 4556 and 5269(30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletions were obtained by the gapped duplex method (40Kramer W. Drutsa V. Jansen H.W. Kramer B. Pflugfelder M. Fritz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 9441-9456Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) with 40-mer oligonucleotide mutagenic primers. Single-stranded DNA was produced using R408 helper phage in Escherichia coli JM101 cells (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used are 5′-GGGCAGAATCCCCACTTCTCCCACTTGAGGACCCGCTCGG-3′ for ΔNF, 5′-GCATCAGAAAGGACATGGCCTGGGCAGAATCCCCACTTCTC-3′ for Δ12, 5′-TTGGGTCTCACATCTCTTGGTGGGCAGAATCCCCACTTCT-3′ for Δ14, 5′-TTGGGTCTCACATCTCTTGGAGCATCAGAAAGGACATGGC-3′ for Δ34, 5′-TTCTCTATGACCCAAAATGTTTTAATTTTGCATATCCATTCAC-3′ for Δ5, 5′-TCATGTCCAGCAGAATCCTGTGGAATTTTGCATATCCATTCAC-3′ for Δ56, 5′-ACAGTGTGAATATCTGCCTTAATTTTGCATATCCATTCAC-3′ for Δ58, 5′-TCATGTCCAGCAGAATCCTGTCTCTTACAAAATACTGGGCA-3′ for Δ6, and 5′-ACAGTGTGAATATCTGCCTTTCTCTTACAAATACTGGGCA-3′ for Δ68. The ΔX-5 mutant was obtained by a combination of the mutants Δ14 and Δ68 using a unique KpnI site in the cDNA encoding for the receptor, located in the region corresponding to CRD 5. The 3′-nucleotide region of Δ68 was excised using KpnI and inserted into Δ14 after removal of its 3′ part with KpnI. All mutations have been verified by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and mutant receptor cDNAs were introduced into COS cells. This cell line was chosen because it lacks endogenous M-type sPLA2 receptor. Half-confluent cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran procedure with 50 μg of DNA per 175-cm2 Petri dish. 3 days later, the cells were scraped, homogenized by sonication, and assayed for 125I-OS1 binding as described previously except that appropriate isotopic dilution of the ligand was made to perform saturation curves(27Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected COS cells were rinsed three times with PBS, scraped in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA and sonicated. Cell membranes were denatured at 95°C for 5 min and loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After separation, the proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond-C Extra (Amersham). Nitrocellulose sheets were blocked with 5% fat-free milk in PBS, incubated with guinea-pig polyclonal antibodies (working dilution 1/5000) raised against the whole purified rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor(27Lambeau G. Schmid-Alliana A. Lazdunski M. Barhanin J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), washed, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-guinea pig-goat IgG (Cappel Res. Products) diluted 10,000 times. After extensive washings in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, blots were revealed with the BM chemiluminescence Western blotting reagent (Boehringer Mannheim), and exposed to X-OMAT AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 min. 24 h after transfection, cells were dissociated and plated onto coverslips in 6-well plates. 3 days after transfection, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, washed, and then incubated for 1 h with the guinea pig M-type sPLA2 receptor antiserum diluted 200 times in PBS. The cells were washed and then incubated for 30 min with anti-guinea pig fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated whole goat IgG (Sigma) diluted 100 times in PBS. After washing, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed through a confocal microscope (Leica). Computational sequence analyses have been performed using gcg(41Genetics Computer Group, (1994) Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Madison, WI.Google Scholar). Molecular weights of the mutant receptors have been computed with the peptidesort program. Multiple sequence alignments of protein sequences of CRDs of identical position have been performed using the pileup program, and their relative percentage of identity has been determined using the distances program. Ten mutants of the M-type sPLA2 receptor have been designed for determination of the domain involved in the binding of sPLA2s to this receptor (Fig. 1). To prevent possible misfolding of expressed proteins, the boundaries of deleted portions were always placed at junction sites between predicted domains. Western blot experiments were performed to check that all of these mutants were correctly expressed in COS cells. The native receptor and all of the mutant receptors were visible as two bands of slightly different molecular weights (Fig. 2). These two bands probably result from differences in the glycosylation level of proteins when overexpressed in COS cells. Apparent molecular weights of native and mutated M-type sPLA2 receptors are consistent with their calculated molecular weights, indicating that all mutants are efficiently translated. No protein band was detected in control mock-transfected cells. Indirect immunostaining experiments were also performed to demonstrate that the wild-type and mutated receptors are targeted to the plasma membrane. Representative results are shown in Fig. 3. A strong labeling was observed at the cell surface for the native receptor and the various mutant receptors, indicating that all of these proteins are normally processed. The low level of staining, which is visible inside the cells, is probably due to receptors engaged in translational or post-translational processes. Taken together, these results suggest that all these mutants are properly expressed in a way similar to that of the wild-type M-type sPLA2 receptor.Figure 2:Immunoblot of native and mutated rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptors. Protein samples were separated on a 7.5% acrylamide gel, transferred electrophoretically to Hybond-C Extra membranes, and subjected to an immunolabeling using an anti-rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor guinea pig antiserum. The lanes are named according to the mutant receptor that has been loaded, and MOCK corresponds to membranes from mock-transfected COS cells. Because mutants in which large regions have been deleted were not labeled as well as the wild-type receptor, various amounts of membranes (3-120 μg of proteins) have been loaded in the different lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Indirect immunostaining of COS cells expressing native and mutated M-type sPLA2 receptors.

The cells were stained with guinea pig anti-M-type sPLA2 receptor antiserum and then with anti-guinea pig fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated whole goat IgG as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) M-type sPLA2 receptors have been first characterized using the snake venom sPLA2s OS1 and OS2, purified from the Taipan snake(26Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Schweitz H. Qar J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11503-11510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and OS1 has become the canonical ligand for M-type sPLA2 receptors(29Lambeau G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, 125I-OS1 was used to determine the sPLA2 binding domain in the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor. Fig. 4 and Table 1 show the results obtained from typical 125I-OS1 binding equilibrium experiments on membranes from wild-type and mutant receptors. The maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) is routinely comprised between 0.5 and 5 pmol/mg of protein, indicating that all mutants are expressed at similar levels as compared with the wild-type M-type sPLA2 receptor (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Analysis of the affinities (Kd values) shows that 125I-OS1 binds to the ΔNF mutant with almost the same affinity as compared with the wild-type receptor. These data clearly indicate that the N-terminal cysteine-rich and the fibronectin-like type II domains are not involved in 125I-OS1 binding. In agreement with this conclusion, a similar deletion of these two domains in the bovine M-type sPLA2 receptor did not modify the binding properties of porcine pancreatic sPLA2(32Ishizaki J. Hanasaki K. Higashino K. Kishino J. Kikuchi N. Ohara O. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5897-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Deletion of CRDs 1-4 (Δ12, Δ34, and Δ14 mutants) only results in 2-6-fold reduced affinities for 125I-OS1 (Table 1). This suggests that the sequence comprising CRDs 1-4 is involved but is not essential for 125I-OS1 binding to the receptor. Deletion of CRDs 6-8 (Δ6 and Δ68 mutants) also leads to lower affinities of 125I-OS1 for the receptor (Table 1). These deletions decreased the affinity for 125I-OS1 by 10- and 12-fold, respectively. These changes indicate that the CRDs 6-8 sequence is also not crucially involved in 125I-OS1 binding, although CRD 6 is likely to play a role in 125I-OS1 binding. A more dramatic effect was observed in different mutants lacking CRD 5 (Δ58, Δ56, and Δ5, see Table 1), demonstrating that this CRD is directly involved in 125I-OS1 binding. All these mutants have completely lost their ability to bind 125I-OS1. It was then interesting to test whether CRD 5 expressed alone was able to bind 125I-OS1. The ΔX-5 construct, in which all CRDs but CRD 5 have been deleted, was still able to bind 125I-OS1, although with a 40-fold reduced affinity (Table 1). Taken together, these data show that the main domain of the extracellular region of the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor involved in 125I-OS1 binding is CRD 5, while CRDs 3, 4, and 6 provide further interactions to increase the affinity of 125I-OS1. The interaction of the M-type sPLA2 receptor with sPLA2s is clearly a protein-protein interaction (30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, besides its sPLA2 binding property, this receptor is also able to recognize sugars such as mannose and galactose(30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, based on the similarity between the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor and the macrophage mannose receptor, we previously observed by competition experiments against sPLA2 binding that the M-type receptor also binds mannose-BSA(30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mannose-BSA is a typical ligand of the mannose receptor (42Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and is known to bind to this receptor mainly via CRDs 4 and 5(43Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was thus interesting to determine which CRDs on the M-type sPLA2 receptor were involved in mannose-BSA binding. The K(0.5) values obtained for the inhibition of 125I-OS1 binding by mannose-BSA to ΔNF and Δ12 mutants are very close to K values obtained with the native receptor (Table 2). This demonstrates that the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, the fibronectin-like type II domain, and CRDs 1 and 2 are not involved in the binding of mannose-BSA to the M-type sPLA2 receptor. Conversely, mannose-BSA was not able to inhibit 125I-OS1 binding on the Δ14, Δ34, and ΔX-5 mutant forms of the M-type receptor. These results are in accordance with those establishing the importance of CRD 4 for the binding of mannose-BSA to the macrophage mannose receptor (42Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Since 125I-OS1 had no measurable affinity on mutated receptors lacking CRD 5, it was not possible to determine the importance of this latter CRD in the binding of mannose-BSA to the M-type sPLA2 receptor.TABLE II Open table in a new tab The affinity of mannose-BSA for the Δ6 and Δ68 mutants of the M-type sPLA2 receptor was decreased 13- and 19-fold, respectively, as compared to its affinity toward the wild-type receptor (Table 2). This suggests that CRDs 6-8 are not crucially involved in the binding of mannose-BSA to the M-type sPLA2 receptor but that these latter CRDs contribute to the binding of mannose-BSA. The involvement of these CRDs in the binding of a glycoprotein such as invertase and in the binding of mannan has already been described in the case of the macrophage mannose receptor(43Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CRD 4 structure of the macrophage mannose receptor is sufficient by itself to bind invertase and mannan, but it does it with a weak affinity and needs the presence of the CRDs 5-8 to bind with an affinity identical to that of the native receptor (43Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as for the macrophage mannose receptor, the CRD 4 structure of the M-type sPLA2 receptor is involved in the binding of glycosylated ligands, but the CRD 5-8 structure is required to confer a full affinity. Although the same CRDs appear to be involved in the binding of mannose-BSA, several lines of evidence suggest that the amino acid residues within these CRDs, which are implicated in the binding process, are different in the two receptors. First, these two receptors, although predicted to share a similar overall structural organization, only display a low identity (28%) at the amino acid level(30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the binding of mannose-BSA to the mannose receptor is strictly Ca2+ dependent(42Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Mullin N.P. Hall K.T. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28405-28413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the binding of sPLA2s to the M-type receptor is Ca2+ independent(46Lambeau G. Ancian P. Nicolas J.-P. Beiboer S.H.W. Moinier D. Verheij H. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5534-5540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We also observed that mannose-BSA is able to inhibit sPLA2 binding in the absence of free calcium. ( 2J.-P. Nicolas, G. Lambeau, and M. Lazdunski, unpublished observations.) In fact, residues predicted to be involved in calcium and sugar binding in the CRDs of the mannose receptor are not conserved in CRDs 4 and 5 of the rabbit M-type sPLA2 receptor(30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, although both receptors bind mannose-BSA, they display different specificities for several other glycoconjugates. For example, galactose-BSA, which is not a good ligand for the mannose receptor(42Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), binds to the M-type sPLA2 receptor (30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while invertase and mannan, which avidly bind to the mannose receptor(42Lennartz M.R. Wileman T.E. Stahl P.D. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 43Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), do not compete with 125I-OS1 binding to the M-type receptor(30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations make it unlikely that both types of receptors bind mannose-BSA through similar residues within their respective CRDs 4-8. The data reported here indicate that the N-terminal cysteine-rich region and the fibronectin-like type II domain are not involved in sPLA2 binding. While the function of the N-terminal cysteine-rich region still remains unknown, we have recently observed that the fibronectin-like type II domain binds to type I and IV collagens(47Ancian P. Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this domain in the M-type sPLA2 receptor might play a role in cell adhesion. From the successive deletions of CRDs, it can be concluded that of the eight CRDs of the M-type sPLA2 receptor, the key domain involved in sPLA2 binding is CRD 5, although other CRDs (mainly CRDs 4 and 6) appear necessary to reach a high affinity. On the other hand, CRDs 1 and 2 are not required for binding. The high conservation of CRD 4 between different animal species (Table 3) has led to suggest that this CRD may have a central role in sPLA2 binding(34Higashino K. Ishizaki J. Kishino J. Ohara O. Arita H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the data shown here indicate that CRD 5 rather than CRD 4 is most directly implicated in sPLA2 binding.TABLE III Open table in a new tab Sequence comparisons show that among the CRDs of sPLA2 receptors, CRD 5 is in fact the least conserved between species (Table 3). The identification of CRD 5 as the most important CRD for sPLA2 binding might explain the differences observed in the binding properties of different sPLA2s to M-type receptors from different species (30Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ancian P. Lambeau G. Mattéi M.-G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Omori-Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with binding properties (affinities and Ca2+ dependence) similar to those observed for M-type sPLA2 receptors(46Lambeau G.

They have been purified from the blood plasma of different snakes(48Inoue S. Kogaki H. Ikeda K. Samejima Y. Omori-Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Ohkura N. Inoue S. Ikeda K. Hayashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, the pulmonary surfactant protein A has been shown to recognize the sPLA2 purified from the Trimeresurus flavoviridis venom and to inhibit its activity(50Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander A. Beers M.F. Bates S.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Very interestingly, the primary structure of all of these proteins has sequence homology with several CRDs of the C-type lectin family and hence with CRDs of M-type sPLA2 receptors. The different CRDs 5 of M-type sPLA2 receptors in different species have a homology of at least 69% (Table 3), while the similarity between these CRDs 5 and CRDs of sPLA2 inhibitors is less than 20%. Sequence comparison between these sPLA2 inhibitors and CRDs of the M-type sPLA2 receptors together with site-directed mutagenesis will probably help to better define residues that, within CRD 5, are crucial for sPLA2 binding. We are indebted to Dr. E. Zvaritch for assistance in preparation of a mutant and for reviewing the manuscript and to P. Ancian for providing the antibodies and for critical reading of the manuscript. We are grateful to Drs. R. Waldmann, J.-P. Hugnot, and M. Hugues for very helpful discussions. The skillful technical assistance of F. Aguila, M.-M. Larroque, C. Roulinat, and A.

https://openalex.org/W2079691647,"Previous studies show that translocation and degradation of apolipoprotein B (apoB), two processes occurring on or within the endoplasmic reticulum, determine how much de novo synthesized apoB is secreted. We determined which of these processes regulates the intracellular fate of apoB by examining whether degradation determines how much apoB is translocated or if translocation determines how much apoB is degraded. HepG2 cells, treated with the cysteine active site protease inhibitor ALLN, previously shown to block the degradation of translocation-arrested apoB in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Du, E., Kurth, J., Wang, S.-L., Humiston, P., and Davis, R. A.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 24169-24176), showed a 10-fold increase in the accumulation of de novo synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled apoB. The majority (80%) of the apoB accumulated in response to ALLN was in the microsomal fraction. In contrast, ALLN did not effect apoB secretion. Since ALLN did not effect the intracellular accumulation of [35S]methionine-labeled albumin and other proteins (trichloroacetic acid-precipitable [35S]methionine-labeled proteins), its effect on apoB was specific. Pulse-chase studies showed that ALLN dramatically reduced the first-order rate of removal of [35S]methionine-labeled apoB from the cell but did not effect its rate of secretion. The finding that ALLN caused the intracellular accumulation of incompletely translated chains of apoB suggests that at least some of the degradation occurs at the ribosomal level. Moreover, 85% of the apoB that accumulated in isolated microsomes in response to ALLN was accessible to exogenous trypsin, indicating this pool of apoB was incompletely translocated.

INTRODUCTIONapoB ( 1The abbreviations used are: apoBapolipoprotein BALLNacetylleucine, leucine, norleucinalPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisVLDLvery low density lipoproteinsCHOChinese hamster ovaryMTPmicrosomal triglyceride transfer proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium.) is the major structural protein responsible for the assembly of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by the intestine and liver(1Kane J.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 3Davis R.A. Vance D. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids and Membranes. Elsevier, New York1991: 403-424Google Scholar). After secretion into blood plasma by the liver, VLDL triglycerides are rapidly hydrolyzed into free fatty acids, which are taken up by peripheral tissues where they are utilized for energy and anabolic purposes. The remaining VLDL remnants, containing apoB100, are then either removed by the liver or converted into LDL, a major risk factor for atherosclerosis (reviewed in (4Havel R.J. Rothchild M.A. Seminars in Liver Disease. Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc., New York1992: 356-364Google Scholar)). Because of the importance of hepatic secretion of VLDL apoB in determining blood levels of LDL, a major goal of our research has been directed toward identifying the regulatory factors and processes.We have made two observations, both of which have shown unusual characteristics governing the hepatic secretion of apoB: 1) a large amount of de novo synthesized apoB is not secreted but is degraded intracellularly (5Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 2) the translocation of apoB across the endoplasmic reticulum is unusually inefficient(6Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results led us to hypothesize that as a result of incomplete translocation, apoB is diverted from the secretory pathway into a degradative pathway that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum(3Davis R.A. Vance D. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids and Membranes. Elsevier, New York1991: 403-424Google Scholar, 6Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulated translocation of apoB across the endoplasmic reticulum could explain the post-translational control of apoB secretion. In several studies, the amount of apoB that is secreted is less than the amount that is synthesized(5Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bjornsson O.G. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Gibbons G.F. Eur. J. Clin.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18514-18520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that the unaccounted for apoB is degraded intracellularly. The consistent observation that in different types of cultured cells and perfused organs obtained from several species, a diverse group of hormones, nutritional states, stimulatory and inhibitory lipids, and mutations in the coding region of apoB alter the rate of apoB secretion by reciprocal changes in its rate of intracellular degradation suggests that this unusual regulatory mechanism of secretion is of general importance (reviewed in Refs. 3, 15-17).An important question toward which this research was directed was to determine whether translocation governs degradation or if degradation governs translocation. To this end we employed the proteolytic inhibitor ALLN, which we have shown blocks the degradation of apoB in CHO cells, which normally degrade all of the apoB expressed by a plasmid construct(18Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the results showing that ALLN also blocks the degradation of apoB100 in HepG2 cells(20Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we examined if blocking the intracellular degradation of apoB would either increase the amount secreted or would cause more to accumulate as an incompletely translocated form. If blocking degradation leads to increased secretion, the data would indicate that degradation determines the fate of apoB. Conversely, if blocking degradation leads to an accumulation of incompletely translocated apoB, the data would indicate that translocation determines the fate of apoB.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureHepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 4% fetal bovine serum, 4% enriched calf serum, and antibiotics as described(21Thrift R.N. Forte T.M. Cahoon B.E. Shore V.G. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 236-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).[35S]Methionine LabelingHepG2 cells were grown to 90% confluence. On the day of the experiments, the culture medium was changed to methionine-free DMEM containing 8% serum. Cultures were incubated for 30 min at 37°C at which time some plates (see figure legends) received the indicated amount of cysteine active site protease inhibitor ALLN (Boehringer Mannheim). 20 min later, 100 μCi/ml [S]methionine (DuPont NEN) was added to each plate, and the cultures were incubated an additional 40 min. Cells and medium were harvested as described (19Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGECells, medium, and microsomal membrane fractions were solubilized in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated overnight with 50 μl of a 50% v/v solution of Sepharose CL-6B beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm, and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h on a shaker with an amount of appropriate antiserum previously determined to maximally immunoprecipitate apoB or albumin. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added to each sample in an amount shown to bind all the antibody, and the samples were incubated on a shaker for an additional hour. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 rpm, and the antigen/antibody protein A-Sepharose pellet was washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline. The pellets were solubilized in sample buffer (0.13 M Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.4 mM EDTA, 5%β-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and separated on a linear 1-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described(5Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Additional aliquots of cells and medium were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid(5Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Pulse-Chase StudiesThe amount of de novo synthesized apoB and albumin synthesized and secreted was determined by pulse-chase analysis as described(5Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only change from the previously reported method was that in some samples the preincubation medium contained ALLN. After 30 min, cells were pulsed with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 10 min. The medium was removed and replaced with 5 ml of serum-enriched DMEM containing 1000-fold excess unlabeled methionine (chase medium) and 40 μg/ml ALLN. At the times indicated in legends, cells and medium were harvested. Samples were immunoprecipitated, separated on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed as described above.First-order rate constants and half-lives were calculated using Sigma Plot program having least-squares analysis.Microsome Isolation and Digestion with TrypsinHepG2 cells were pulsed for 40 min with [35S]methionine as described above. Microsomes were isolated from HepG2 cells by nitrogen cavitation followed by ultracentrifugation as described(5Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The microsomal pellet was immediately resuspended in 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Protein content was assayed by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as the protein standard. Trypsin digestion was carried out as described(6Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each microsomal sample contained 150 μg of protein and was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with one of the following: 1) no trypsin, 2) 100 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma), 3) 1 mg/ml type I soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) plus 100 μg/ml trypsin. The digestion was stopped by adding inhibitors(6Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The microsomes were re-isolated by centrifugation, resuspended, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE(6Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSALLN Increases the Accumulation of ApoB100 in Cells and Microsomes but Does Not Affect Its SecretionHepG2 cells were incubated with and without the cysteine active site protease inhibitor ALLN, and the amount of de novo synthesized 35S-labeled apoB100, albumin, and total protein (i.e. trichloroacetic acid precipitable) were quantitated. Preliminary studies show that at the concentration used (40-50 μg/ml), ALLN did not affect the amount of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated 35S-labeled protein in either cells or medium for all experiments performed (data not shown). In contrast, after 4 h of constant labeling with [35S]methionine, ALLN treatment caused 35S-labeled apoB100 to accumulate in cells by 10-fold, compared to control cells (Fig. 1). In this and all other experiments described below, there was no detectable change in the amount of 35S-labeled apoB100 secreted into medium. In contrast to its effect on apoB accumulation in cells, ALLN did not affect the amount of 35S-labeled albumin in either cells or medium (Fig. 1).We examined if ALLN caused 35S-labeled apoB100 to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum, where the majority of apoB in liver cells resides(5Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Davis R.A. Prewett A.B. Chan D.C. Thompson J.J. Borchardt R.A. Gallaher W.R. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1185-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with ALLN for 20 min and then labeled with [35S]methionine for 40 min. Cells were isolated and disrupted by nitrogen decavitation, and microsomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Total cell homogenates and microsomes were subjected to immunoprecipitation. In three separate experiments, during the 40-min labeling period, ALLN increased the accumulation of 35S-labeled apoB100 in cells by 3.0 ± 0.4-fold in whole cells and 2.3 ± 0.9-fold in microsomes (Table 1). These data show that the majority (77%) of the apoB that accumulated in cells was isolated in the microsomal fraction.TABLE I Open table in a new tab ALLN Blocks ApoB100 Degradation but Does Not Affect Its SecretionTo determine if ALLN blocks the degradation of apoB100, causing it to accumulate in microsomes, we performed pulse-chase studies. HepG2 cells were incubated with and without ALLN (50 μg/ml) for 0.5 h and then pulsed with [35S]methionine for 10 min. The cells were then chased with methionine replete medium containing the same amount of ALLN as was present in the original pulse medium. At the indicated time of the chase period, cells and medium were harvested and immunoprecipitated using the appropriate antisera.Analysis of the 35S-labeled apoB100 during the pulse-chase experiment shows that immediately after the pulse period, there are several small molecular weight forms of apoB that disappeared during the chase period (Fig. 2A). These smaller molecular weight forms of apoB are likely to be incompletely translated nascent chains of apoB residing on the ribosome, as demonstrated by the increased amount of 35S-labeled apoB100 that appears in cells after 20 min of chase (Fig. 3). After this time, in both groups of cells (with and without ALLN) 35S-labeled apoB100 was rapidly lost from the cell (Fig. 2A). After a 30-min period, 35S-labeled apoB100 appeared in the medium obtained from cells treated both with and without ALLN (Fig. 2). Since even in the presence of ALLN, the amount of 35S-labeled apoB100 that appeared in the medium was less than the amount that was lost from the cells, under the conditions of this experiment ALLN does not appear to block all of the intracellular degradation of apoB100. It should be pointed out that the time course and amount of ALLN used for our experiments was determined empirically to not cause cytotoxicity as determined by no effect on the amount of 35S-labeled albumin that accumulated in either cells or medium (Fig. 2B) or the amount of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 35S-labeled proteins (data not shown). We have found that higher concentrations of ALLN will inhibit protein synthesis. Because of the cytotoxicity of ALLN, it is not possible to conclude that the dose of ALLN used in our studies was sufficient to block all ALLN-inhibitable proteolysis.Figure 2:Pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation of apoB100 and albumin from HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were cultured in methionine-free DMEM containing 8% serum with (+) or without(-) 50 μg/ml ALLN for 0.5 h. [35S]Methionine was added to the culture medium, and the cells were incubated 10 min. After the labeling period, cells were chased with medium containing a 1000-fold excess of cold methionine and the same amount of ALLN as was present in the initial incubation. A, cells and medium were harvested after 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min of chase. Equal portions of cell lysates (C) and medium (M) were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-human apoB antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE. B, cells and medium were harvested after 0, 15, 30, and 120 min of chase.

In three separate plates of cells, we examined the quantitative effects of ALLN on apoB accumulation in cells and secretion into the medium during the pulse-chase experimental protocol. ALLN did not significantly affect the rate nor the relative amount of 35S-labeled apoB100 that appeared in the cultured medium (Fig. 3). These pulse-chase study results confirm the previous data (Fig. 1) showing that while ALLN increases the cellular accumulation of 35S-labeled apoB100, there is no effect on secretion. Moreover, the data extend these observations by showing that the accumulation of cellular 35S-labeled apoB100 is caused by a decreased rate of removal (i.e. degradation).It is interesting to note that during the chase period, ALLN blocked the rate of disappearance of the incompletely translated forms of 35S-labeled apoB that appear as several bands of lower molecular weight than apoB100 (Fig. 2A). With the proviso that ALLN did not affect the rate of apoB translation, these data suggest that a portion of the intracellular degradation of apoB occurs before it is completely translated.The ApoB100 That Accumulates in Microsomes from ALLN-treated HepG2 Cells Is Incompletely Translocated. Evidence That Translocation Is Saturated in HepG2 CellsMicrosomes, isolated from HepG2 cells labeled with [35S]methionine in the presence and absence of ALLN, were subjected to trypsin digestion to determine how much of the apoB100 that accumulates in response to ALLN remains incompletely translocated. In microsomes from HepG2 cells not treated with ALLN, approximately 82% of the apoB was degraded by trypsin, indicating it was incompletely translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4). In microsomes from HepG2 cells treated with ALLN, approximately 85% of the total apoB100 present was accessible to trypsin (Fig. 4). Since in both groups of microsomes essentially all (90%) of the albumin was resistant to trypsin digestion (Fig. 4), the microsomes remained intact and orientated in the correct manner. Furthermore, addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor prior to adding the trypsin completely prevented the digestion of apoB100, indicating that proteolysis did not occur after the addition of detergent required to disrupt microsomes prior to immunoprecipitation. Additional studies showed that adding Triton X-100 without inhibitors prior to trypsin digestion caused all of the apoB100 and albumin to be degraded, indicating that sufficient trypsin was present to have digested all exposed protein. The combined data indicate that nearly all of the apoB100 that accumulates in HepG2 cells as a result of ALLN treatment resides in microsomes as an incompletely translocated form. It should be pointed out that ALLN did increase (2-fold) the amount of apoB that was resistant to trypsin digestion (Fig. 4). Within the context of our experiments, it is not possible to know whether this apoB is fully lumenal or is trypsin resistant for other reasons (e.g. folded or complexed with other proteins or lipids). Since ALLN clearly did not augment the secretion of apoB, this trypsin-resistant apoB apparently is not secreted.Figure 4:Susceptibility of apoB100 and albumin in microsomes to trypsin digestion. HepG2 cells were cultured in methionine-free DMEM containing 8% serum with (+) or without(-) 50 μg/ml of the inhibitor ALLN for 20 min. [35S]Methionine was added to the culture medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 40 min. Microsomes were isolated and incubated with the indicated presence of trypsin and/or soybean trypsin inhibitor. The reaction was stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor, and microsomes were reisolated. Equal portions were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal anti-human apoB or an anti-human albumin antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe results presented in this report indicate that the translocation step is responsible for directing apoB into either the secretory or degradation pathways. Furthermore, the data show that under the conditions used to culture HepG2 cells, the amount of apoB that is synthesized is in excess of the amount that is fully translocated, and the “excess” incompletely translocated pool of apoB is shunted into a degradative pathway that can be blocked by ALLN. Taken together, these results indicate that the capacity of HepG2 cells to translocate apoB determines its two major intracellular fates: secretion and degradation. These conclusions are based on the following observations. First, blocking intracellular degradation of apoB by treating HepG2 cells with ALLN caused apoB100 to accumulate intracellularly in microsomes (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Most (77%) of the apoB100 that accumulated in the microsomes following ALLN treatment was susceptible to degradation by exogenous trypsin (Fig. 4), indicating that portions of the protein were exposed on the cytoplasmic surface (i.e. it remained incompletely translocated). A previous study indicates that the apoB100 that accumulates in microsomes from both ALLN-treated and untreated HepG2 cells assumes an orientation in which 69 kDa of the N terminus is intralumenal, with the remaining C-terminal portions residing on the cytoplasmic surface(19Du E. Kurth J. Wang S.-L. Humiston P. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24169-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The finding that secretion of apoB and albumin is not affected by ALLN supports the view that under the conditions of these experiments this proteolytic inhibitor did not cause a general impairment of protein synthesis, translocation, or secretion. With the proviso that ALLN does not specifically inhibit apoB translocation, we are compelled to conclude that the inability of ALLN treatment to augment apoB100 secretion is because one or more factors that determine the ability of HepG2 cells to translocate apoB is operating at its capacity (both with and without ALLN treatment).Our results are consistent with those of a previous study showing that ALLN did not affect the secretion of apoB100 but did increase its intracellular accumulation(20Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study did not examine the translocation status of the accumulated apoB100. Our results showing that essentially all of the apoB100 that accumulates in ALLN-treated HepG2 cells is incompletely translocated extends this earlier work by demonstrating for the first time that translocation, not degradation, determines how much apoB is secreted. The additional finding that ALLN caused several small apoB peptides to accumulate in pulse-labeled cells suggests that at least some of the degradation of apoB occurs before it is completely translated. These data raise the interesting possibility that translocation arrest and degradation may be concerted processes.For most constitutive secretory proteins, rates of secretion are linked to rates of synthesis(23Hartmann E. Sommer T. Prehn S. Gorlich D. Jentsch S. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 24Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E.

In contrast, under most circumstances the rate of apoB secretion is not linked to its rate of synthesis (reviewed in (3Davis R.A. Vance D. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids and Membranes. Elsevier, New York1991: 403-424Google Scholar)). As our studies presented here suggest, increasing the availability of apoB by blocking its rapid degradation with ALLN does not lead to increased secretion. Under the conditions used in our experiments, translocation of apoB cannot adapt to accommodate more apoB for entrance into the secretory pathway. However, there are several conditions in which the secretion (hence translocation) of apoB can be augmented (e.g. nutritional status, reviewed in (15Vance J.E. Vance D.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 337-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). In a previous study, adding oleic acid to the medium of ALLN-treated HepG2 cells increased the secretion of apoB100 to a greater extent than in HepG2 cells not treated with ALLN(20Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results led to the proposal that oleic acid increased the translocation of apoB100(20Sakata N. Wu X. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22967-22970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the finding that oleic acid but not ALLN increases the translocation of apoB suggests that lipid, not the amount of apoB, signals an increase in this app"

Mice were injected intravenously with chylomicron-like emulsions labeled with radioactive lipids. Blood samples were taken at fixed time intervals from the retro-orbital sinus, and clearance rates of the lipoproteins were assessed from the decline in plasma radioactivities. To follow the intracellular pathway of remnants in the liver, emulsions labeled with a fluorescent cholesteryl ester (BODIPY) were injected, and liver sections were processed and assayed by laser confocal microscopy. Catabolism of remnant cholesteryl esters was assessed by injecting emulsions labeled with cholesteryl[1-14C]oleate and measuring the expired CO2 from each animal.In apoE-deficient mice, remnant removal from plasma was totally impeded, while the clearance of remnants in LDLr-deficient mice was similar to that in C57BL/6J control mice. The confocal micrographs of livers 20 min after injection of fluorescent chylomicron-like emulsions showed evenly distributed fluorescent particles in the hepatocytes from control mice. In contrast, the fluorescent particles were mainly located in sinusoidal spaces in LDLr-deficient mice. Three hours after injection the livers from control mice showed few fluorescent particles, indicating that remnants have been catabolized, while the sections from LDLr-deficient mice were still highly fluorescent. Micrographs from apoE-deficient mice showed no fluorescent particles in the liver at any time after injection. Measurement of expired radioactive CO2 after injection of emulsions labeled in the fatty acid moiety of cholesteryl oleate indicated that remnant metabolism was slower in the LDLr-deficient mice and essentially nil in the apoE-deficient mice. Control mice had expired 50% of the injected label by 3 h after injection.We conclude that under normal circumstances, chylomicron remnants are rapidly internalized by LDLr and catabolized in hepatocytes, with a critical requirement for apoE. When LDLr is absent, remnants are taken up by a second apoE-dependent pathway, first to the sinusoidal space of the liver, with subsequent slow endocytosis and slow catabolism. Hepatic clearance via this second pathway is increased by heparin, inhibited by lactoferrin, heparinase, and suramin, and down-regulated by feeding a high fat diet.

The inhibition of the assembly of apoB-48 VLDL occurred at BFA levels that allowed a major secretion of both transferrin and apoB-48 HDL. The assembly of apoB-100 containing lipoproteins was also inhibited by BFA but could be reactivated by a 30-60 min chase in the absence of BFA, which agreed with the time that was estimated to be needed to restore the secretory pathway (approximately 60 min). Also the assembly of apoB-48 VLDL was reversible. Both apoB-48 and apoB-100 that was labeled in the presence of BFA assembled VLDL after removal of the BFA.Both apoB-100 and apoB-48 were associated with the membrane pellet of the microsomes.

Hardman D.A. Paulus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2465-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). ApoB-100 consists of 4536 amino acids, while apoB-48 corresponds to the N-terminal 48% of apoB-100. Both proteins are coded for by the same gene(2Scott J. Mol. Biol. & Med. 1989; 6: 65-80PubMed Google Scholar). The apoB-100 mRNA is converted to mRNA for apoB-48 by an enzyme-dependent deamination of cytidine in codon 2153, which converts this codon into the signal for translational stop (3Powell L.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from studies in McA-RH7777 cells indicate that during translation/translocation apoB-48 forms a small dense particle (100 Å in diameter), floating as HDL. This small particle appears to acquire the major amount of lipids in a second step and is in this way converted into a VLDL particle. The second step is dependent upon ongoing biosynthesis of proteins other than apoB; moreover, it is stimulated by oleic acid(7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The assembly of apoB-100 VLDL is more complicated(7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and our results indicate that the VLDL particles are assembled at least to a certain extent in relatively close connection with the translation/translocation of the protein.Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite that has been shown to block the intracellular transfer and secretion of proteins(13Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in a reorganization of the secretory pathway(14Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1991; 67: 449-451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 15Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Both the reorganization of the pathway and the inhibition of the intracellular transport are reversible(16Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bloom G.S. Kreis T.E. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The reorganization is due to an inhibition of the budding of transport vesicles in the pathway concurrent with continued activity of the retrograde transport. Of importance for the budding of transport vesicles in the secretory pathway is the binding of a 21-kDa protein, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), to the membrane, thus initiating the formation of coatomers(17Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 18Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ARF needs to bind GTP to be able to bind to the membrane, and this GTP is hydrolyzed when the coat of the transport vesicle is depolymerized. The GDP is then exchanged for GTP by a guanidine nucleotide exchange protein. It is believed that BFA inhibits this exchange and thus prevents ARF from initiating the budding of transport vesicles, which in turn leads to the inhibition of the vesicular transport through the secretory pathway(19Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 20Helms J.B. Rothman J.

Recent results suggest that BFA inhibits an unknown target protein of importance for the function of the guanidine nucleotide exchange protein(22Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).BFA has frequently been used to block the intracellular transport of proteins, allowing investigators to dissect important sorting and folding processes in the early part of the secretory pathway. For example, results using BFA-treated cells have demonstrated a post-translational degradation of apoB-100(23Sato R. Imanaka T. Takatsuki A. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11880-11884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins is a complex process involving at least two steps (7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that may take place in different parts of the endoplasmic reticulum(24Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10556-10564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it cannot be ruled out that BFA could have fundamental influences on this assembly process.In this paper we have investigated the effect of BFA on the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL and apoB-48 VLDL.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsEagle's minimum essential medium, nonessential amino acids, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin were from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, Ca).

The gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 35,000 rpm, at 12°C, for 65 h. The gradients were unloaded from the bottom of the tube into 12-13 fractions.Immunoprecipitation of ApoB and ElectrophoresisApoB was precipitated from cells, medium as well as from fractions of the gradient, as described(7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, autoradiography, and determination of the radioactivity in the proteins separated in the gels was carried out as described(29Wettesten M. Boström K. Bondjers G. Jarfeldt M. Norfeldt P.-I. Carella M. Wiklund O. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe Effect of Brefeldin A on the Assembly of ApoB LipoproteinsMcA-RH7777 cells were incubated with different amounts of BFA for 15 min, pulsed with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture for 10 min (in the presence of the indicated concentration of BFA) and then chased for periods of 30 or 120 min (also in the presence of the indicated amount of BFA).The culture medium was recovered after the 120-min chase and the secretion of pulse-labeled transferrin was determined. The culture medium was also analyzed by gradient ultracentrifugation and apoB-48 and apoB-100 was recovered by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE from each of the fractions of the gradient and the radioactivity was determined. As reported earlier(7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), normal McA-RH7777 cells secreted apoB-100 on particles with the density of VLDL while apoB-48 is secreted both on VLDL and HDL-like particles (the major amount though on VLDL). In these experiments we therefore followed the radioactivity of apoB-100 as well as that of apoB-48 in the VLDL fraction (referred to as apoB-100 VLDL and apoB-48 VLDL, respectively). We also followed the apoB-48 radioactivity in the HDL density regions. The dense particle with apoB-48 that bands in the HDL density region will be referred to as apoB-48 “HDL.”The results (Fig. 1A) indicated that the secretion of transferrin differed from that of apoB-48 VLDL with regard to the sensitivity to BFA. Thus while 70% of the original secretion (i.e. the secretion seen in the absence of BFA) of transferrin was retained at a BFA concentration of 0.1 μg/ml and 60% at 0.2 μg/ml, there was a rapid drop in the secretion of apoB-48 VLDL with increasing concentration of BFA. Thus only traces (6%) of the original secretion of apoB-48 VLDL were seen at a BFA concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. Interestingly enough the secretion of apoB-48 HDL closely followed that of tranferrin but differed from that of apoB-48 VLDL.Also the rate of secretion of apoB-100 VLDL decreased with increasing concentration of BFA, although the effect of BFA was not as pronounced as on the secretion of apoB-48 VLDL. However, in the presence of 0.2 μg/ml BFA the remaining secretion of apoB-100 VLDL was significantly lower than that of transferrin and apoB-48 HDL.After the 30-min chase, the luminal content of the total microsomal fraction was recovered and analyzed by gradient ultracentrifugation. ApoB-48 and apoB-100 were recovered by immunoprecipitation from each of the fractions of the gradient and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.The results (Fig. 1B) indicated that the appearance of apoB-48 VLDL in the microsomal lumen closely followed the secretion of the lipoprotein into the medium. Thus, in agreement with the almost total loss of secretion of apoB-48 VLDL from cells treated with 0.2 μg/ml BFA, no assembly of the lipoprotein could be detected in these cells (compare Fig. 1, A and B). On the contrary, a substantial amount of apoB-48 HDL was assembled even at a BFA concentration of 10 μg/ml. Thus the assembly of this dense particle did not seem to be influenced by BFA but its rate of secretion was rather depending on the availability of an open secretory pathway.Also the appearance of apoB-100 VLDL in the secretory pathway followed the secretion of the lipoprotein. Thus there was a significant reduction in the assembly of the lipoprotein at a BFA concentration of 0.2 μg/ml and an almost complete failure to detect apoB-100 in the microsomal lumen at BFA concentrations above 0.5 μg/ml.The effect of BFA on the assembly of the apoB-containing lipoproteins was also investigated by pulse-chase studies. In these experiments the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml BFA. The BFA-treated cells were preincubated for 15 min and pulsed for 10 min in the presence of BFA, as described above, and then chased (in the presence of BFA) for periods between 0 and 90 min. The normal McA-RH7777 cells were treated in the same way but in the absence of BFA.In accordance with our previous results(7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the normal cells assembled apoB-100 VLDL and apoB-48 VLDL. The results from the entire pulse-chase experiment are not shown but the relevant information could be illustrated by Fig. 1B (0 μg/ml BFA) which shows normal cells that have been pulsed for 10 min and chased for 30 min, i.e. the chase period after which the maximal amount of apoB radioactivity was recovered with the two VLDL particles from the microsomal lumen(7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, apoB-48 formed, in addition to VLDL, also apoB-48 HDL. Also in agreement with our previous results (7Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we demonstrated the assembly of apoB-100 particles with higher density which were not secreted from the cells.In agreement with the experiments shown in Fig. 1B (10 μg/ml BFA), no apoB-100 VLDL could be detected in the microsomal lumen of the BFA-treated cells after any of the chase periods (Data not shown). However, trace amounts of apoB-100 radioactivity could be detected in the denser fractions of the gradient during these experiments.The assembly of apoB-48 VLDL was also inhibited, however, apoB-48 HDL could be isolated from the lumen of the total microsomal fraction after the different periods of chase (c.f. Fig. 1B, 10 μg/ml BFA).To obtain an estimate of the assembly of the different apoB-48 and apoB-100 containing lipoproteins in the BFA-treated cells, we compared the formation of the particles in these cells with that in normal cells. The cells were pulsed for 10 min and chased for 30 min (see above). The luminal content of the total microsomal fraction was recovered and analyzed by gradient ultracentrifugation. ApoB-100 and apoB-48 was recovered from each fraction of the gradient by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. The apoB-48 radioactivity in apoB-48 VLDL and apoB-48 HDL was determined. We also determined the apoB-100 radioactivity present in apoB-100 VLDL, as well as in the more dense particles (present in the HDL and LDL density range). The results were expressed as the relation (percent) between the radioactivity of the lipoprotein recovered from BFA-treated cells and the corresponding lipoprotein recovered from normal cells. As could be expected from the appearance of the autoradiograms (Fig. 1B, compare 0 and 10 μg/ml BFA) we could not detect any significant apoB-48 radioactivity in apoB-48 VLDL recovered from the microsomal lumen of the BFA-treated cells. On the contrary, the apoB-48 radioactivity associated with apoB-48 HDL recovered from the BFA-treated cells amounted to 120 ± 27% (mean ± S.D., n = 4) of the corresponding radioactivity found in normal cells. Only traces of apoB-100 containing lipoproteins was detected in the microsomal content of the BFA-treated cells, thus in the HDL + LDL density range we found 7 ± 7% (mean ± S.D., n = 5) of the radioactivity present in the same density range in normal cells. The corresponding recovery of radioactive apoB-100 in apoB-100 VLDL was 2 ± 3% (mean ± S.D., n = 5).These results indicate that the only apoB containing lipoprotein that was assembled in the BFA-treated McA-RH7777 cells was apoB-48 HDL. The rate of assembly of this lipoprotein appeared to be in the same range as that in normal cells.The rate of biosynthesis of apoB-48 and apoB-100 in normal and BFA-treated cells were estimated as the incorporation of radioactivity during a 10-min pulse with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture. There were no differences between normal and BFA-treated cells as to the radioactivity recovered in apoB-48 (at the highest BFA concentration used (10 μg/ml): 36,690 ± 6,065 dpm (normal) versus 36,963 ± 2,808 dpm (BFA treated); mean ± S.D., n = 5). There was (at 10 μg/ml BFA), however, a slight decrease in the total incorporation of radioactivity into apoB-100 (19,534 ± 4,076 dpm versus 27,193 ± 4,992; mean ± S.D., n = 5).Effect of Brefeldin A on the Turnover of ApoB in the Microsomal MembraneContrary to the failure to detect apoB-100 in the microsomal lumen of the BFA-treated cells, we found a substantial amount of the protein associated with the membrane pellet. Also a significant amount of the apoB-48 radioactivity was recovered with the membrane pellet after the carbonate treatment (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Turnover of apoB-100 and apoB-48 in the microsomal membrane of BFA-treated (A) and normal (B) cells. McA-RH7777 cells, cultured in the presence of oleic acid, were incubated with BFA (10 μg/ml culture medium) for 15 min and pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture for 10 min (in the presence of BFA) and chased for 0, 15, 30, 90, 120, and 180 min in the presence of BFA. Normal cells were treated in the same way except that BFA was omitted. The total microsomal fraction was isolated after each chase period and the membranes were recovered after extraction of the luminal content with sodium carbonate. ApoB was recovered by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the experiment shown in Fig. 2 we investigated the turnover of the membrane-associated form of apoB-100 and apoB-48. The BFA-treated cells (10 μg/ml culture medium) were pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture and chased for periods between 0 and 180 min. The results indicated that there was a slow turnover of the membrane-associated apoB-48 in BFA-treated cells. To further investigate this we pulse labeled the cells for 10 min and chased for 10 and 180 min and determined the proportion of the radioactivity of the membrane-associated apoB, present after the 10-min chase, that remained in the cell after the 180-min chase. In normal cells only 21 ± 2% of the radioactivity of the membrane-associate apoB-48 could be recovered after 180 min chase while in the BFA-treated cells we recovered 122 ± 30% (data are mean ± S.D., n = 4). There was also a decrease in the turnover of membrane-associated apoB-100 in BFA-treated cells, however, not that pronounced as for apoB-48. Thus 40 ± 7% of the membrane-associated apoB-100 remained after 180 min chase of the BFA-treated cells while 9 ± 7% remained in normal cells (data are mean ± S.D., n = 4).Reactivation of the Assembly ProcessSince the effect of BFA on the intracellular transport is reversible, we investigated whether the assembly of the apoB-containing lipoproteins could be reactivated by chasing the cells in the absence of BFA. In the first experiments the cells were preincubated with BFA for 15 min and chased for 40 min in the presence of BFA. The cells were then chased for periods of 30, 60, and 120 min in the absence of BFA. After each chase period, the cells were incubated with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture for 90 min, and the appearance of apoB-containing VLDL was followed in the medium and in the luminal content of the microsomes. The results clearly indicated that already after a 30-min chase in the absence of BFA (+90-min incubation with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture), the cells assembled and secreted radiolabeled apoB-100 VLDL as well as apoB-48 VLDL (data not shown).A second set of experiments was carried out to determine the time needed for the reactivation of the assembly process. Cells were preincubated with BFA for 15 min and then chased for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min in the absence of BFA. After each chase period the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture for 10 min. The total microsomal fraction was then recovered and its luminal content analyzed by gradient ultracentrifugation. The results (Fig. 3A) indicated that the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL had been reactivated after a 30-min chase in the absence of BFA. In two additional experiments we could detect the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL after the 45 and 60 min chase, respectively. Thus the reactivation of the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL in cells treated with 10 μg/ml BFA required a BFA-free chase of 30-60 min. To determine how this reactivation time compared with the time needed to reconstitute the secretory pathway, we followed the secretion of transferrin. BFA-treated cells (10 μg/ml) were preincubated for 15 min with BFA and pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture in the presence of BFA. Normal cells were preincubated and pulsed in the absence of BFA. Both cells were then chased in the absence of BFA for periods between 0 and 120 min. After each period we followed the secretion of radioactive transferrin in the medium. The results indicated that in the normal cells, transferrin started to be secreted after a chase of 20-30 min (Fig. 3B). In the BFA-treated cells the secretion of transferrin was delayed; it started to appear in the medium after 90 min chase. It should be pointed out that the total biosynthesis of transferrin and the final amount of radioactive transferrin secreted was comparable under the two conditions (not shown). We also followed the secretion of the high molecular mass immunoglobulin-binding protein (the tentative unprocessed complement factor C3)(30Lodish H.F. Kong N. Hirani S. Rasmussen J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This protein was secreted after a 30-min chase from untreated cells, while BFA-treated cells started to secrete it after 90 min (not shown). These results indicate that it takes approximately 60 min for the secretory pathway to be reorganized.Figure 3:A reactivation of the assembly process for apoB-100 VLDL in BFA-treated cells. McA-RH7777 cells, cultured in the presence of oleic acid, were incubated with BFA (10 μg/ml culture medium) for 15 min. The cells were then chased for 5, 15, or 30 min in the absence of BFA. After each chase period the cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine-cysteine mixture for 10 min. The luminal content of the total microsomal fraction was then recovered and subjected to gradient ultracentrifugation. ApoB was recovered from each fraction of the gradient by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography.

The architecture of the CFTR promoter suggests regulatory characteristics that are consistent with the absence of a TATA-like sequence, including the ability to initiate RNA transcription at numerous positions. Detailed investigation of the most proximal region of the human CFTR gene promoter through deletion and mutational analysis reveals that expression is contingent on the conservation of the inverted CCAAT sequence. Basal expression of CFTR transcription and cAMP-mediated transcriptional regulation require the presence of an imperfect and inverted CCAAT element recognized as 5′-AATTGGAAGCAAAT-3′, located between 132 and 119 nucleotides upstream of the translational start site. RNA isolated from a transfected pancreatic cell line carrying integrated wild-type and mutant CFTR-directed transgenes was used to map the 5′ termini of the transgenic transcripts. Analysis of the transcript termini by ribonuclease protection analysis reflects the direct association of the conserved inverted CCAAT sequence in promoting transcript initiation. Because of the requirement for the inverted CCAAT sequence for promoting transcription of CFTR, the involvement of CCAAT-binding factors is suspected in the regulation of CFTR gene transcription. To test this, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to demonstrate that the majority of the binding to the inverted CCAAT element, between -135 and -116, was easily competed for by binding to cognate nucleotide sequences for CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). An antibody specific for the C/EBP-related protein, C/EBPδ, detected C/EBPδ as part of a nuclear protein complex bound to the inverted CCAAT sequence of the CFTR gene. Also, the detection of specific activating transcription factor/cyclic-AMP response element binding protein antigens by antibody supershift analysis of nuclear complexes suggest that species of this family of transcription factors could be involved in the formation of complexes with C/EBPδ within the CFTR gene inverted CCAAT-like element.

https://openalex.org/W1984080552,"Immunoprecipitates of metabolically labeled PC12 cells consistently contained a 43-kDa protein that was associated with Shc, a signal-transducing protein with a single SH2 domain. Following affinity chromatography with immobilized recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Shc fusion protein, the 43-kDa protein was identified as actin by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. Cosedimentation experiments using purified actin and GST-Shc showed that Shc binds directly to F-actin, confirming Shc-actin interaction in vivo. Various GST-truncated Shc fusion proteins were prepared and used in actin cosedimentation assays. Constructs containing the SH2 and collagen homology domains were not precipitated, and those containing the amino-terminal domain were. Thus, Shc-actin interactions do not occur in the region of tyrosine phosphorylation and leave the SH2 domain free to bind to other tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules. Although the major pool of Shc in unstimulated PC12 cells is soluble, two other pools are associated with the cytoskeleton and the submembranous cytoskeleton. Upon nerve growth factor stimulation, approximately 50% of the soluble Shc translocates to both cytoskeleton environments within 2 min, decreasing thereafter. When cells were pretreated with cytochalasin D, a drug that disrupts actin filaments, Shc translocation to the cytoskeleton was abolished. However, in the submembranous fraction, the Shc level was elevated in resting cells following cytochalasin D treatment. The kinetics of translocation, compared to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and the nature of the Shc-actin interaction suggest that the cytoskeletal association of Shc, induced by growth factors, may be related to membrane ruffling and actin fiber reorganization.

When a receptor such as that for NGF is activated, Shc binds rapidly to a specific phosphotyrosine of the receptor and becomes phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue(1Pelicci G.

Several recent studies have shown that Shc binds the activated receptor in the NPXpY sequence by its amino-terminal or phosphotyrosine binding domain(30van den Geer P. Wiley S. Ka-Mam Lai V.

This mechanism suggests that Shc SH2 domain remains free to interact with other yet unidentified phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. In addition, it has been shown that the Shc phosphotyrosine binding domain is able to recognize several other non-receptor phosphoproteins(36Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that when a growth factor receptor contains a binding site for Shc and Grb-2, the Shc pathway is dominant(5Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olefsky J.M. J.

This could be explained by the higher affinity of the phosphotyrosine binding domain for the NXXpY motif compared with the affinity that the SH2 domains display for their proper binding sites (32Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 1177-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Besides its binding to activated receptors, Shc has been shown to associate with intracellular molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(37Harrison-Findik D. Susa M. Varticovski L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1385-1391PubMed Google Scholar), Sos(38de Vries-Smits A.M. Pronk G.J. Medema J.P. Burgering B.M. Bos J.L.

Shc has oncogenic properties since its overexpression induces transformation in fibroblasts and differentiation in PC12 cells(1Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 16Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Differentiation of PC12 cells induced by NGF requires Shc activity. When Tyr 490 of TrkA, the binding site for Shc, is mutated to phenylalanine, NGF can no longer promote PC12 cell differentiation (3Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 585-590Crossref Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In the present study, Shc synthesis in PC12 cells stimulated by NGF and other growth factors was examined. It was observed that a 43-kDa protein was always found in Shc immunoprecipitates. This protein was identified as actin. This suggests a relationship between Shc and the cytoskeleton that was confirmed by the fact that, after NGF stimulation, Shc rapidly translocates from a soluble compartment to the cytoskeleton in an actin-dependent manner. Mouse EGF and βNGF were prepared by the method of Savage and Cohen (44Savage C.R. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7609-7611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Mobley et al.(45Mobley W.C. Schenker A. Shooter E.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 5: 5543-5552Crossref Scopus (524) Google Scholar). A bFGF analog in which all half-cystine residues were replaced by serines (46Fox G.M. Schiffer S.G. Rhode M.F. Tsai L.B. Banks A.R. Arakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from G. Michael Fox (Amgen Inc., CA). Polyclonal anti-Shc and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), monoclonal anti-Shc and monoclonal anti-Grb-2 antibodies were purchased from Transductional Laboratories (Lexington, KY), monoclonal anti-actin antibody, rabbit muscle actin, poly-L-lysine, and cytochalasin D were from Sigma. Immobilon-P and Immobilon-CD membranes were from Millipore. pGEX-3X bacterial expression vector and glutathione-agarose were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other chemicals were of the highest quality available. PC12 cells were obtained from E. Shooter (Stanford University) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% Pen-Strep solution (Life Technologies, Inc) (complete medium) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were plated in collagen-coated 6-well plates in complete medium, grown to 70% confluence, and serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% horse serum for 48 h. Growth factors were added to the medium (EGF, 20 ng•ml-1; NGF, 100 ng•ml-1; bFGF, 10 ng•ml-1) for the indicated period of time. For the last 2 h of growth factor stimulation, the medium was replaced by methionine-free medium containing 200 μCi•ml-1 of [35S]methionine (ICN). Cells were then washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg•ml-1 aprotinin, 10 μg•ml-1 leupeptin) and sonicated. After 10 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Shc polyclonal antibody followed by protein A-agarose precipitation. Agarose beads were washed five times in RIPA buffer, once in TBS, and boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Immunoprecipitates were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film for 24 h. Full-length human Shc cDNAs encoding 46- and 52-kDa forms and cDNA fragments encoding residues 1-377 (NCH), 233-473 (CHSH2), 233-377 (CH), and 378-473 (SH2) were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from HepG2 cell total RNA (see Fig. 1). The PCR primers were designed according to published sequences(1Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The PCR products were subcloned into the BlueScript plasmid vector (Stratagene) for sequencing to ensure fidelity. There was one difference from the published sequences in codon 399 with no effect on the coding potential of the cDNA. The cDNAs were then cloned in the pGEX-3X bacterial expression plasmid, which was used to transform the protease-deficient BL21 Escherichia coli strain. The resulting glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were induced by 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Bacteria were lysed by sonication in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM benzamidine, 10 μg•ml-1 leupeptin, and 10 μg•ml-1 aprotinin. After centrifugation for 10 min at 30,000 × g at 4°C, the expressed GST fusion proteins were isolated from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose beads, washed 4 times in lysis buffer, and stored at 4°C on agarose beads in TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM benzamidine, and 10% glycerol. cDNA fragment encoding Shc-1-232(N) was also subcloned in pGEX expression vector. However, this fragment could not be expressed as a GST-fusion protein. A RIPA buffer PC12 cell extract corresponding to 50 × 150 mm dishes was incubated with GST-p52She-agarose for 4 h at 4°C. The agarose beads were washed several times in the same buffer, and GST-p52She eluted with reduced glutathione. The eluted material was mixed with a [35S]methionine-radiolabeled Shc immunoprecipitate, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto an Immobilon-CD membrane. The membrane was negatively stained according to the manufacturer's recommendations and exposed with a x-ray film. After 48 h, the film was developed, and the band corresponding to the radioactive Shc-coimmunoprecipitated 43-kDa protein was excised. The band was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) using a modification of the method of Zhang et al.(47Zhang W. Czernik A.J. Yungwirth T. Aebersold R. Chait B.T. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as described(48Patterson S.D. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Following digestion, the supernatant was removed and stored, the membrane was sequentially extracted with acetonitrile (30% followed by 60%)/trifluoroacetic acid (2.5%), and the extracts were stored separately. Approximately 10% (0.3 μl) of the supernatant and of the acetonitrile extracts were applied to the mass spectrometer slide and mixed with an equal volume of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 33 mM, Hewlett-Packard). The MALDI-MS spectra were internally calibrated with oxidized insulin B chain (Sigma) as described(49Patterson S.D. Katta V. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3727-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The spectra were obtained on a Kompact MALDI-III (Shimadzu/Kratos) in positive ion mode using both the linear and reflectron settings as described previously(49Patterson S.D. Katta V. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3727-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific fragmentation was obtained by post-source decay (PSD-)-MALDI-MS (50Spengler B. Kirsch D. Kaufmann R. Jaeger E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) using a Voyager RP Biospectrometry Workstation (Perspective/Vestec Products) with parent-ion selection, which allows fragmentation of a specific ion from a mixture. The sample was prepared as above for MALDI-MS, and reflected spectra were recorded at various mirror ratios (reflector voltage/linear voltage) decreasing from 1 to 0.11 while maintaining a constant linear accelerating voltage of 25 kV and a grid voltage of 90%. The spectra were concatenated and calibrated using the manufacturer's software. GST-fusion proteins (Fig. 1) were eluted from glutathione-agarose beads with reduced glutathione as described (51Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) and quantified on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel using a dilution series of bovine serum albumin. Actin sedimentation assays were performed essentially according to den Hartigh et al.(52den Hartigh J.C. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 119: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of GST-fusion proteins, GST, or a mixture of proteins were incubated with 10 μg of rabbit muscle G-actin for 10 min in 200 μl of buffer containing 2 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM ATP. Actin polymerization was induced by adding 75 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl2, and, after 1 h at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 25°C. The supernatant was carefully removed, concentrated with Microcon ultrafiltration units (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA), and mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. When cosedimentation assay was performed with the CH domain of Shc, proteins contained in the supernatant and the pellet were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the presence of GST-CH was detected with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system. To determine whether Shc could bind to unpolymerized G-actin, 2 μg of agarose-bound GST-Shc fusion protein were mixed with 10 μg of G-actin in the same condition as for the cosedimentation assay in the absence of KCl and MgCl2. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature with a continuous gentle agitation, agarose-bound GST-Shc fusion proteins were washed 2 times in incubation buffer with or without 1% Triton X-100. Agarose beads were then boiled in loading buffer, and proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. PC12 cells were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated 150-mm dishes in complete medium, grown to 70% confluence, and serum-starved for 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% horse serum. Cells were then stimulated for the indicated period of time with 100 ng•ml-1 of NGF. When cells were treated with cytochalasin D, the drug was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 2 μM 2 h before adding NGF. After stimulation, dishes were immediately placed on ice, and cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μM Na3VO4 and 50 mM NaF, harvested, and pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Cell pellets were then immediately lysed in 200 μl of extraction buffer (EB) (53Fox J.E.B. Boyles J.K. Berdt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2% Triton X-100, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg•ml-1 leupeptin, 20 μg•ml-1 aprotinin, 2 mM Na3VO4. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the Triton-insoluble residues were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 10 min and washed twice with 1 ml of 2 × diluted EB. The two first supernatants were mixed, and the submembranous cytoskeleton was sedimented from this fraction by further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min(54Fox J.E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1673-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These pellets were washed once with 2 × diluted EB. Triton-insoluble and submembranous cytoskeletal extracts were incubated for 30 min on ice in 0.5 ml of 2 × diluted EB containing 0.5 M NaCl and 0.3% deoxycholic acid and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. To the supernatants was added 1 ml of EB in order to lower the concentration of NaCl and deoxycholic acid. Shc was immunoprecipitated by incubating with 3 μg of anti-Shc polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4°C followed by protein A-agarose precipitation. Immunoprecipitated materials were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. Membranes were blocked for at least 2 h at room temperature in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 4% BSA before being probed with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and analyzed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). After detection of phosphotyrosine, membranes were stripped in glycine-HCl (pH 2.5), 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at 80°C. Membranes were then reblocked and reprobed with anti-Shc monoclonal antibody. Exposed films were digitalized with a scanner (Hewlett Packard) and analyzed with the Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). PC12 cells, metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and stimulated for the indicated period of time either with EGF, NGF, or bFGF, were lysed, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated with an anti-Shc polyclonal antibody and run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 2, 46- and 52-kDa forms of Shc were easily detected in unstimulated PC12 cells, indicating that Shc synthesis is active in resting cells. A doublet at 68 kDa was also detected, and, although the molecular size of this doublet suggests it could correspond to the previously described 66-kDa Shc-related protein(1Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), this band was not detected on Shc immunoblots (data not shown). Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this doublet corresponds to another Shc-unrelated protein that is co-immunoprecipitated with Shc. Following growth factor stimulation, the level of Shc synthesis was not significantly altered with time. However, a band at 43 kDa (p43), which was already detectable in resting cells, clearly appeared in Shc immunoprecipitates. Interestingly, p43 synthesis seemed to be regulated upon NGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2, p43 reached a maximal level after 4 h of NGF stimulation and decreased thereafter but remained high up to 24 h following NGF stimulation. The same result was obtained for bFGF, but not for EGF for which the level of p43 synthesis remained stable (data not shown). These data indicated that a 43-kDa protein associated in vivo with Shc and that its synthesis is stimulated and regulated by neurotrophic"
https://openalex.org/W1990617987,"We have investigated how modulation of integrin αIIbβ3 function influences the mechanisms that initiate platelet thrombus formation onto surface-bound fibrinogen and isolated fibrinogen domains. Under stationary conditions and with full activation of platelets blocked by prostaglandin E1, the carboxyl-terminal γ400-411 sequence is necessary for establishing initial contact with the immobilized substrate. Molecules containing a single copy of this sequence, like the plasmin-generated fibrinogen fragment D, support platelet spreading, but the resulting attachment to the surface is loose and disrupted by minimal peeling force. In contrast, platelets adhere firmly to intact fibrinogen under the same conditions, suggesting that recognition of contact sites outside a single D domain can secure the firm interaction not supported by a single γ400-411 sequence. If platelets are activated, the γ400-411 sequence is no longer necessary to initiate the adhesion process but becomes sufficient, even as a single copy, to mediate stable surface attachment in the absence of shear stress. Under conditions of flow, however, intact fibrinogen but not fragment D can support adhesion, regardless of whether platelets have the potential to become activated or not. These results indicate the functional relevance of multiple fibrinogen domains during the initial stages of the platelet adhesion process.

https://openalex.org/W2089342910,"In this study, we identify and characterize a novel gene, CL-20, that encodes a 17.8-kDa protein with sequence and structural similarity to the growth arrest-specific gene gas3/peripheral myelin protein gene PMP22. The CL-20 protein exhibits a 43% identity with PMP22. The positions of the four lipophilic domains and the N-glycosylation site of PMP22 are conserved in CL-20, suggesting that it also is an integral membrane glycoprotein. The CL-20 gene is located on human chromosome 12 rather than 17 and encodes a 2.8-kilobase mRNA instead of 1.7-kilobase mRNA. These observations indicate that the CL-20 gene is related to but distinct from PMP22. In contrast to PMP22, CL-20 mRNA and protein are induced during squamous differentiation of rabbit tracheal epithelial cells in vitro, and Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization demonstrated that CL-20 mRNA is most abundant in squamous epithelia. These results indicate that the high expression of CL-20 is closely correlated with squamous differentiation. The differences in tissue-specific expression and regulation between CL-20 and PMP22 suggest different roles for these two proteins. Retinoids, which inhibit squamous differentiation, repress the induction of CL-20. The retinoic acid receptor-selective retinoid SRI-6751-84 is the most effective in suppressing CL-20, suggesting that the activation of the retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway is important in this suppression."

INTRODUCTIONPlasma membrane anion exchangers (AE) ( 1The abbreviations used are: AEanion exchangerWRKWoodward's reagent KPCRpolymerase chain reactionHEKhuman embryonic kidney 293 cellsDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonateBCECF2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidbpbase pair(s).) constitute a diverse family of transporters, which, in mammalian cells, contribute to the control of transmembrane anion gradients, cell volume, and acid-base homeostasis. Three members of this family, designated AE1-AE3, have been cloned and demonstrated by functional expression to mediate transmembrane exchange of the physiological substrates, chloride and bicarbonate (reviewed in Kopito(1990) and Alper(1991)). In mammals, AE1-AE3 are expressed in a tissue- and cell-specific manner. The best characterized among these is AE1, which was first identified as the major integral membrane protein of the erythrocyte, known as “band 3”. AE1-mediated anion exchange is rapid, electrically silent, and tightly coupled (see Passow(1986), Knauf(1986), and Macara and Cantley(1983) for reviews). The latter two features are best explained by a “ping-pong” kinetic model in which anion translocation in one direction is temporally distinct from, but dependent upon, anion translocation in the opposing direction. This tight substrate coupling ensures that the flow of one substrate is driven by the electrochemical potential of the other. Thus, anion exchangers can be used by cells to establish Cl- gradients at the expense of pH (HCO3-) (Vaughan-Jones, 1979, 1982) or pH gradients at the expense of Cl- (Paradiso et al. 1987).Anion exchange by AE1 is highly selective, both for anions over cations and among different anions (see Passow(1986), Knauf(1986), and Macara and Cantley(1983) for reviews). AE1 displays strong selectivity for its physiological substrates, transporting chloride 10-250 times more rapidly than other halides. Remarkably, despite their dissimilar size, charge distribution, and atomic structures, chloride and bicarbonate are transported by AE1 at nearly the same rate (Lowe and Lambert, 1982). This contrasts sharply with the transport of the divalent sulfate anion, which, although structurally similar to bicarbonate, is transported by AE1 at a rate nearly 10,000-fold slower than chloride or bicarbonate (Brahm, 1988; Schnell et al. 1977). Protons have opposing effects on the transport by AE1 of monovalent anions such as Cl- and HCO3- and divalent anions like sulfate. These dramatic differences in transport rates and proton dependence between the transport of monovalent and divalent anions have been reconciled by Gunn(1972) who proposed that protonation of a titratable group with pKa~5 could convert AE1 from a monovalent to a divalent anion carrier. Milanick and Gunn(1984) further suggested that the transport mechanism requires at least two distinct ion binding sites: one for anions and one for protons. They proposed that proton binding could serve to alter the net charge of the anion binding pocket that crosses the permeability barrier during translocation (Milanick and Gunn, 1984). This model is consistent with the observation of a stoichiometric flux of protons accompanying sulfate during sulfate-Cl- countertransport (Jennings, 1976). The AE2 exchanger, which is expressed in a wide variety of cell types (Kopito, 1990), shares key features with AE1, including a preference for Cl- and HCO3- as substrates, sensitivity to stilbene disulfonate inhibitors (Lee et al., 1991), and proton-stimulated sulfate transport (Sekler et al., 1995). These conserved features, therefore, may reflect fundamental aspects of the underlying transport mechanism.Despite the wealth of kinetic and biophysical data on anion exchanger-mediated transport, and despite the availability of cloned cDNAs for three members of the AE family, the mechanistic details of how anion exchangers maintain a remarkably robust ability to catalyze extremely fast transport of the structurally dissimilar chloride and bicarbonate anions are known. Moreover, little is known about the amino acids specifically involved in ion binding, transport, or pH regulation. Chemical modification studies of anion transport in erythrocytes have provided some support for the involvement of certain amino acids in the anion exchange reaction cycle. These studies (Julien and Zaki, 1988; Wieth et al., 1982) have suggested that at least one unidentified arginine is essential for anion translocation. While modification of lysines by stilbene disulfonate and other lysine-specific reagents inhibits transport activity (Cabantchik and Rothstein, 1974; Jennings and Nicknish, 1985), site-directed mutagenesis of the lysines which constitute the covalent binding site for stilbene disulfonates fails to alter the ion affinity or the rate of ion transport, suggesting that they are not directly involved in the transport process (Garcia and Lodish, 1989; Wood et al., 1992). The participation of other AE1 lysines in anion translocation has not been resolved.Carboxyl residues have also been implicated in AE-mediated anion transport. Treatment of red blood cells with carbodiimide compounds inhibits monovalent anion transport (Craik and Reithmeier, 1985; Bjerrum et al., 1989). More recently, treatment of red blood cells with carboxyl-specific Woodward's reagent K (WRK), followed by borohydride reduction, inhibited chloride transport by ~75-80% while stimulating SO42-/Cl- exchange (Jennings and Al-Rhaiyel, 1988). Significantly, WRK treatment eliminates both the pH dependence of sulfate transport and the proton flux which normally accompanies SO42-/Cl- exchange (Jennings and Al-Rhaiyel, 1988), suggesting that the WRK modified carboxyl may be the same as the titratable group originally proposed by Gunn(1972). The WRK-modified carboxyl residue in human AE1 was recently identified by Edman degradation to be Glu-681, predicted to be located near the cytoplasmic interface of transmembrane helix 8 and is conserved among all anion exchangers known to date (Jennings and Smith, 1992).The present work examines the functional and structural consequences of mutating the glutamate in mouse AE1 (Glu-699) and AE2 (Glu-1007), which correspond to the WRK-reactive residue (Glu-681) in human erythrocyte AE1. The data support the hypothesis that this glutamate in mouse AE1 and AE2 plays a key role in determining the ion selectivity and kinetics of anion transport by these closely related anion exchangers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPolymerase Chain Reaction MutagenesisMouse AE1 mutants, AE1E699A, E699Q, and E699D and AE2 mutants AE2E1007K, E1007Q, and E1007D were constructed by megaprimer PCR mutagenesis (Landt et al., 1990; Sarkar and Sommer, 1990). PCR was performed on the double-stranded AE2/pRBG4 expression vector as the template. The reverse mixed primer, 5′ GGT GAT CTG TGT CT(G,T) CAT, GAA, GAT, GAG 3′, was the mutagenic primer for AE2E1007K and E1007Q. The reverse primer, 5′ GGT GAT CTG TGT ATC CAT GAA GAT GAG 3′, was the mutagenic primer for AE2E1007D. The mutagenic primers and the forward primer, 5′ AAC AGC CGG TTC TTC CCT GGC C 3′, (upstream of the mutagenic site) were used to generate a ≈ 250-bp megaprimer by Vent polymerase. This megaprimer was eluted from an agarose gel and used in conjunction with a reverse primer, 5′ CTT TAT TTG TAA CCA TTA TAA GC 3′ (downstream of the mutagenic primer on the multiple cloning site of pRBG4), to generate a ≈ 1-kilobase fragment. This final PCR product harbors two unique restriction sites, one for BalI between the reverse mutagenic primer and the upstream forward primer and another for HindIII in between the megaprimer and the reverse primer on the multiple cloning site of pRBG4. The final PCR product of ≈ 1 kilobase was eluted from an agarose gel, subjected to a double digest by BalI and HindIII, and the ≈970-bp restriction product was then subcloned into the AE2/pRBG4 expression vector. The vector (≈6930 bp) used for ligation was generated by partial restriction digest of the AE2/pRBG4 expression vector (≈7900 bp) using HindIII and BalI, with the latter restriction enzyme having three additional target sites on the AE2/pRBG4 expression vector. All mutants were sequenced throughout their PCR-generated regions (Sanger et al., 1977).Expression of Anion Exchangers in Cultured CellsMurine anion exchanger cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector pRBG4 and expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (Lee et al., 1991). Cells were grown and transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and maintained in humidified incubators at 37°C and 5% CO2. Anion exchangers were expressed by transient transfection of HEK cells as described previously (Lee et al., 1991; Ruetz et al., 1993) except that calcium phosphate-precipitated plasmid was added at 16 μg of plasmid/150-mm tissue culture plate.ClEfflux Assay in Whole CellsFor a single time course, trypsinized and triturated HEK293 cells from three 150-mm plates were washed in the standard chloride buffer (30 mM NaCl, 16 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 200 mM sucrose). The cells were then resuspended in isotopic standard chloride buffer containing 5 μCi of [36Cl] NaCl in the presence of 3 μM valinomycin (to depolarize the membrane potential and thereby increase 36Cl accumulation and minimize electrogenic Cl- currents) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then pelleted and the isotopic supernatant carefully removed. The time course was initiated by resuspending the 36Cl-loaded cells in degassed, non-isotopic standard reaction buffer and terminated by passing an aliquot through a Dowex column as described in (Sekler et al., 1995) followed by washing with 1.5 ml of ice-cold 300 mM sucrose.Preparation of Crude MicrosomesMicrosomes were prepared as described previously (Sekler et al., 1995). Unless otherwise stated all steps were performed at 0-4°C. Medium was removed from 5 to 10 150-mm culture dishes, and the cells were harvested using a plastic cell scraper, resuspended in 3 ml of wash buffer (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for each plate, pooled, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm (551 × g) for 10 min in a H-6000A Sorvall rotor. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20-40 ml of wash buffer, and cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm (291 × g) for 10 min. The cellular pellet was resuspended in 10-20 ml of swelling buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The suspension was then subjected to centrifugation at 4000 rpm (4660 × g). The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10-20 ml of swelling buffer, homogenized with 50 strokes using a 5-ml glass Dounce homogenizer, and sonicated twice for 1 s using a G112SPIT cylinder-shaped bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Co.) that was operated at 80 × 103 cycles/s at 300 watts. Sucrose solution was then added from a 70%, w/v, stock to achieve a final concentration of 10%, w/v. The nuclear fraction was removed by centrifugation at 1200 rpm (400 × g) for 5 min, and the supernatant was spun at 3700 rpm (4100 × g) for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was made to 50 mM KCl and 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. This mixture was spun at 35,000 rpm (140 × 103× g) in a Ti 45 Beckman rotor for 50 min, and the final microsomal pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 7%, w/v, sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 15 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5. Crude microsomes derived from 10 150-mm plates were resuspended in 0.5-1.2 ml at a protein concentration of about 1 mg/ml, homogenized using a 2-ml tight Teflon glass homogenizer, and immediately frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen for up to 60 days.Reconstitution of the Anion ExchangerReconstitution into proteolipisomes was performed as described previously (Sekler et al., 1995). Unless otherwise stated, all steps were performed at 0-4°C. Crude microsomes (40-80 μg of protein in 40-80 μl) were mixed with a 50-fold excess (w/w) of sonicated soybean asolectin (Sigma) in the standard sulfate buffer (20 mM Na2SO4, 10 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.0, and 2 mM MgSO4) with 70 μCi of [35S]Na2SO4 (1050-1600 Ci/mmol (DuPont NEN) in a final volume of 0.5-1 ml in the presence or absence of 300 μM DIDS. The reconstitution mixture was subjected to one cycle of rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at room temperature, followed by 5 × 1 s of sonication cycles using a G112SPIT cylinder-shaped bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Co.) that was operated at 80 × 103 cycles/s. To remove tracer not trapped inside the proteoliposomes and to exchange to the desired extravesicular buffer, the sample was spun for 5 min through a prechilled 10-ml Sephadex G-50 fine (Pharmacia) column at 1200 rpm (400 × g) in a H-6000A Sorvall rotor that was semi-dried by centrifugation for 3 min at 900 rpm (200 × g) in the same rotor. Prior to the semi-dry processing the resin was preswollen by boiling 2 h in water then equilibrated with at least 2 column volumes of desired buffer without the isotopic tracer.Sulfate Transport AssaysSulfate transport assays were performed as described previously (Sekler et al., 1995). [35S]SO42- transport was initiated by transferring the proteoliposomes to a 30°C water bath and terminated by passing 50-100-μl aliquots through Dowex-1 (Bio-Rad) anion exchange columns that were converted into a formate form and packed into 1.5-ml Pasteur pipettes as described (Gasko et al., 1976). Loading of the sample was followed by washing with 1.5 ml of ice-cold isomolar sucrose solution. Recoveries of the anion exchanger after the Sephadex spin and Dowex columns were determined by immunoblot to be between 85 and 95%. Time 0 of each reaction was determined by passing ice-cold proteoliposomes on the Dowex column. Different preparations showed sulfate efflux specific activity that ranged from 150 to 450 × 103 cpm of [35S]SO42-/mg of protein × min at 20 mM SO42-, pH 6, for AE1 and AE2. These values correspond to 4-12 nmol of SO42-/mg protein × min. For sulfate influx experiments, proteoliposomes were formed in the standard sulfate buffer as described above with nonradioactive sulfate. Transport was initiated by adding 70-100 μCi of [35S]SO42- to 1 ml of proteoliposomes and passing the proteoliposomes through a 3-ml Dowex column. The transport data represent an average of at least three independent experiments each performed in triplicate.pH Dependence of Sulfate EffluxProteoliposomes were formed as described above and passed through a semi-dry Sephadex spin-down column, equilibrated with standard sulfate buffer in which 10 mM MES was replaced by 10 mM MES and 10 mM HEPES brought to the desired pH with KOH. To avoid formation of a ΔpH across the proteoliposomes, 10 μM nigericin (Sigma) and 5 μM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (Sigma) were added prior to passage of the proteoliposomes over the semi-dry spin column, and sulfate flux experiments were performed as described above. The dissipation of the pH gradient was verified by spectrofluorimetric analysis of intravesicular pH in proteoliposomes reconstituted in the presence of the acid form of 1 μM BCECF (Molecular Probes).Surface Labeling of AE2Cell surface biotinylation was performed essentially as described (Loo and Clarke, 1995). Briefly, HEK cells transfected with the various plasmids and grown on 100-mm dishes were incubated for 10 min with 10 mM NaIO4 on ice. The cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), incubated for 30 min on ice with 2 mM biocytin hydrazine (Pierce), and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. The treated cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated as described previously (Ward and Kopito, 1994) with anti-AE antibody (Thomas et al., 1989). Immunocomplexes were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellullose, and probed with streptavidin peroxidase. Signals were detected using chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.).Intracellular pH DeterminationTransiently transfected 293 HEK cells were grown for 48-72 h on 7 × 12-mm glass coverslips coated with 100 μg/ml poly-L-lysine. The cells were loaded with 5 mM of acetoxymethyl ester form of BCECF (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37°C and mounted in a flow cuvette. The coverslip was continuously perfused with standard chloride or chloride-free (gluconate substituted) Ringer's solution as described previously (Kopito et al., 1989). Intracellular pH was recorded by monitoring the fluorescence emission at 530 nm from alternate excitation at 499 and 439 nm using a SPEX-DM3000 spectrofluorometer. Intracellular pH was calibrated by the nigericin high K+ method as described previously (Thomas et al., 1979).Miscellaneous DeterminationsSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli, 1970) immunoblot processing was performed as described (Ruetz et al., 1993). Protein concentration was determined with bicinchoninic acid reagent (Sigma) in the presence of SDS using bovine serum albumin as a standard.RESULTSMutation of the WRK Glutamate Alters the Kinetics and pH Dependence of Divalent Anion TransportThe initial rate of [35S]sulfate efflux from AE-reconstituted, sulfate-loaded proteoliposomes was used to assess the divalent anion exchange capacity of anion exchanger mutants (Fig. 1). Proteoliposomes were reconstituted with crude microsomal membranes from HEK cells expressing the designated wild-type or mutant anion exchanger. We have previously shown that 35SO42- efflux by wild-type AE1 and AE2 proteoliposomes is trans-anion-dependent, activated by protons and is sensitive to inhibition by disulfonic stilbenes (Sekler et al., 1995). In the present study the initial rates of sulfate efflux mediated at pH 6 by wild-type AE1 (Fig. 1A) and wild-type AE2 (Fig. 1B) were 194 ± 27 and 272 ± 35 cpm × 105× mg protein-1× min-1, similar to values reported previously (Sekler et al., 1995). This assay was used to examine the effect on sulfate transport of mutations in the Woodward's reagent K-reactive glutamate (Glu-699) in AE1 and the corresponding residue (Glu-1007) in AE2. Sulfate efflux in all cases was inhibited by the disulfonic stilbene, DIDS. Mutation of Glu-699 and Glu-1007 to glutamine (AE1 and AE2), lysine (AE2), or alanine (AE1) had no significant effect on the initial rate of sulfate transport. Remarkably, the most conservative substitution, glutamate → aspartate, virtually abolished sulfate transport, reducing it to levels indistinguishable from the basal (DIDS-inhibited) values.To exclude the possibility that the observed differences were attributable to variation in the expression levels of the wild-type and mutant proteins, the AE content of the proteoliposomes used in this experiment was assessed by immunoblotting using an antibody that recognizes the C-terminal domain of AE1 and is cross-reactive with AE2 (Thomas et al., 1989) (Fig. 1). The data indicate that all anion exchangers and mutants within each class (AE1 and AE2) were expressed at similar levels. The doublet of AE2 bands at 160 and 140 kDa correspond to mature (bearing complex oligosaccharides) and immature (high-mannose oligosaccharides) AE2 (Ruetz et al., 1993), suggesting that wild-type and mutant AE2 proteins were similarly distributed in pre- and post-Golgi compartments. Together, these data suggest that the capacity to transport divalent anions by AE1 is not explained simply by the charge or protonation state of the side chain at position 699, as suggested previously by chemical modification studies. Moreover, these data suggest that the structural requirements at this site are largely conserved between the related anion exchangers AE1 and AE2.Sulfate transport by AE1 has been reported previously to be steeply pH-dependent, suggesting the participation of protonation of a specific acidic residue in the transport process (Schnell et al., 1977). Because we have previously observed a similar pH dependence of sulfate transport by AE2 (Sekler et al., 1995), we examined the effects of the above-described mutants on the pH dependence of sulfate transport (Fig. 2). Initial rates of sulfate transport were determined under pH-clamp conditions between pH 5.5 and 7.5, such that intravesicular and extravesicular pH were matched. As observed previously, the pH dependence of wild-type AE1 and AE2 was characteristically steep. At pH 7.5, sulfate transport rates by wild-type AE1 and AE2 at pH 7.5 were reduced by 75-80% of the rate at pH 5.5. By contrast, the pH dependence of AE1 (Glu-699) and AE2 (Glu-1007) mutants was significantly diminished. The initial rates of sulfate efflux of AE1E699Q and AE1E699A mutants were only ~20% lower at pH 7.5 than at pH 5.5. This pH insensitivity of sulfate transport was even more dramatic for the AE21007Q and AE21007K mutants; we could detect no significant difference in sulfate transport rate between pH 5.5 and 7.5. We conclude that this conserved glutamate plays a key role in determining the pH dependence of sulfate exchange mediated by AE1 and AE2.Figure 2:pH dependence of sulfate/sulfate exchange mediated by wild-type and mutant anion exchangers. Tracer [35S]SO42- efflux from proteoliposomes reconstituted with AE1 (left panel) or AE2 (right panel). Amino acids at AE1 position 699 were glutamate (wild type, squares); glutamine (circles), or alanine (diamonds). Amino acids at AE2 position 1007 were glutamate (wild type) (squares), glutamine (circles), or lysine (diamonds). Intravesicular and extravesicular pH were clamped with nigericin and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone to the values indicated on the abscissa, and sulfate transport rates were determined as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and under “Experimental Procedures.” Values indicated represent the means of triplicate measurements. The specific activity of sulfate efflux for AE1 and AE2 at pH 6 were 213 ± 27 and 264 ± 35 cpm of [35S]SO42-/mg of protein × min, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A Critical Role for AE2 Glu-1007 in Monovalent Anion TransportTwo whole cell assays were used to determine the effects of mutation of the conserved glutamate residue on the transport of monovalent anions. The small internal volume of proteoliposomes and the rapid kinetics of chloride as compared with sulfate transport precluded our ability to use the reconstituted anion exchangers for investigation of monovalent anion exchange kinetics. Since mouse AE1 is retained in intracellular compartments (Ruetz et al., 1993), these assays could be performed only for AE2, which is efficiently delivered to and stable at the plasma membrane (Ruetz et al., 1993). To confirm the surface expression of AE2 and to determine whether the AE2 Glu-1007 mutants were also present at the cell surface, transfected HEK cells were surface labeled with a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent. Following labeling, anion exchangers were immunoprecipitated, fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Surface-accessible anion exchangers were then detected by streptavidin-peroxidase staining (Fig. 3). The data show that wild-type AE2 and all of the glutamate mutants were labeled to a similar extent. By contrast, no labeling was observed for AE1, which is known to be retained in an intracellular compartment (data not shown) (Ruetz et al., 1993). Similarly, the reagent failed to react with the 140-kDa band corresponding to the “immature” form of AE2 that is restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum (Ruetz et al., 1993), indicating that the label was specific for proteins expressed at the cell surface. These data demonstrate that mutation of Glu-1007 does not influence either the expression level or the fraction of anion exchanger expressed at the cell surface of HEK cells.Figure 3:Expression of AE2 at the cell surface is unaffected by mutations at position Glu-1007. HEK cells expressing wild-type (Glu) AE2 or AE2 substituted at position 1007 with the indicated residues were surface labeled by biocytin hydrazine, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with AE antibody. Immunocomplexes containing labeled AE2 were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellullose, and detected using streptavidin peroxidase as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of wild-type AE2 resulted in a marked acceleration of the initial rate of 36Cl efflux from HEK cells compared with vector transfected control cells (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the transport was completely dependent on the presence of trans-Cl-, was inhibited by the impermeable anion gluconate, and was completely inhibited by the anion exchange inhibitor, DIDS. Increasing external Cl- from 30 to 50 mM stimulated a significant increase in the rate of 36Cl- efflux from 1.54 ± 0.22 to 2.2 ± 0.23 × 10-6 cpm 36Cl-× mg protein-1× min-1. These experiments show that AE2-mediated Cl- efflux from HEK cells is inhibited by disulfonic stilbenes and is stimulated by the presence of a trans-anion, suggesting that AE2 in these cells is functionally expressed at the cell surface.Figure 4:AE2 glutamate 1007 is essential for Cl-/Cl- exchange. A, characterization of the Cl- efflux assay. HEK cells expressing wild-type AE2 were loaded with 36Cl- and the rate of isotope efflux was determined in the presence of media containing 20 mM (squares) or 50 mM chloride (triangles). Control efflux determinations on AE2-transfected (circles) or mock-transfected cells (diamonds) were performed in the presence of 30 mM Cl- alone (diamonds), 30 mM gluconate (open circles), or 30 mM Cl- containing 300 μM DIDS (closed circles). The specific activities for the [36Cl-] efflux measurement for wild-type AE2 in 30 and 50 mM Cl-, respectively, were 1.54 × 10-6± 0.22 and 2.2 × 10-6± 0.23 cpm [36Cl-]/mg of protein × min. B, effect of substitution of Glu-1007 (squares) with aspartate (triangles), lysine (circles), or glutamine (diamonds) on tracer [36Cl-] efflux into media containing 20 mM Cl-.

These findings underscore the importance of Ig superfamily molecules in cell-cell communication during nervous system development.

Ig superfamily molecules have also been classified into two groups by their mode of membrane association, with some containing a phosphatidylinositol anchor (20Gennarini G. Cibelli G. Rougon G.

Interestingly, some Ig superfamily members undergo alternative splicing to generate multiple forms that differ in the type of membrane association used(23Cunningham B.A. Hemperly J.J.

In the nervous system gicerin expression is transient, restricted to early stages of development when neurons extend neurites or undergo migration(30Kato S. Taniura H. Taira E. Miki N. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 140: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas constitutive expression is found in muscles and kidney. Introduction of gicerin into L929 fibroblast cells in vitro indicate that gicerin exhibits homophilic cell adhesion activity in addition the heterophilic adhesion to NOF(27Taira E. Takaha N. Taniura H. Kim C.-H. Miki N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we noted that Western blot analysis of endogenous gicerin in chicken gizzard reveals a doublet band, perhaps reflecting the presence of alternatively spliced products. In the present study, we identified and characterized a novel longer isoform of gicerin termed l-gicerin, which contains a different cytoplasmic tail than that found in the previously reported form of gicerin (s-gicerin (accession number D38559)). We have also investigated possible functional differences between these two gicerin isoforms and compared their expression during nervous system development. A λgt 11 chicken gizzard cDNA library (Clontech) was used for screening using the plaque hybridization method. A cDNA probe encoding gicerin (27Taira E. Takaha N. Taniura H. Kim C.-H. Miki N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was prepared by the random primer labeling method with [32P]dCTP, and screening was carried out with standard procedures(31Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1982Google Scholar). Purified cDNA inserts were subcloned into a Bluescript II SK(-) phagemid vector (Stratagene), and the sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Both strands were fully sequenced by obtaining endonuclease-digested fragments. Total RNA was isolated from chicken gizzard smooth muscle by the AGPC method (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and a 1-μg aliquot was reverse-transcribed by murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The products were then used for PCR templates with synthetic oligonucleotide primers which contained EcoRI restriction site: G-5′, TATAGAATTCTTGATTGGCAGCGGGCATGG; I-5′, TATAGAATTCAGATAAACTTTCCGAAGAGG; for 5′ primers and G-3′, TATAGAATTCGTAAGCGAAGTCTGCTGCTGA and I-3′, TATAGAATTCCTCTTCGGAAAGTTTATCTGA; for 3′ primers (I-5′ and I-3′ were complementary). The sequences between the two primers; G-5′/G-3′, G-5′/I-3′, and I-5′/G-3′ were amplified by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) using the following parameters: 96°C for 1 min, 55°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min for 30 cycles and then 72°C for 7 min. PCR products amplified between G-5′/G-3′ and G-5′/I-3′ were digested with endonuclease SacI that recognized a single site in the products. These digested and undigested DNA fragments were separated by 2% agarose-gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Multiple antigen peptides (MAP) were generated by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy using MAP core molecule attached to PA-Resin (Novabiochem)(34Posnett D.N. McGrath H. Tam J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1719-1725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptides corresponded to residues 579-590 (TKPEARKDKNVV) (Peptide A) and residues 605-624 (QCANAEKRSPADQSEKYIDL) (Peptide B) that were l-gicerin-specific and located in the cytoplasmic tail. The products were purified through Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia). After rabbits were immunized with a mixture of these two multiple antigen peptides, the sera were collected. Cultured cells were harvested with a cell scraper after rinsing twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' solution. The harvested cells or freshly dissected chicken tissues were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline(-) with a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellets were solubilized in 10 mM Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. They were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 90 min after incubating at 4°C on a rotating shaker for 1 h, and the resultant supernatants were used for Western blot analysis(27Taira E. Takaha N. Taniura H. Kim C.-H. Miki N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The supernatant fraction obtained after Nonidet P-40 extraction was preadsorbed with protein A (Pharmacia), incubated with each antiserum, and then immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose. Heat-denatured supernatant was processed for Western blot analysis. To examine the effect of deglycosylation, the Nonidet P-40-extracted fraction was digested with N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) overnight. Proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The blots were incubated with primary antiserum after blocking with 2% skim milk. Then the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed with diaminobenzidine. A cDNA encoding l-gicerin (lG) was subcloned into pcDNA1 (Invitrogen) to construct the expression vector pcDNA1-lG. For establishing cell lines that express l-gicerin, mouse fibroblast L929 cells were transfected with both pcDNA1-lG and the neomycin resistance vector pMAM-neo (Clontech), using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) (10:1). G418-resistant clones were isolated after being cultured for 2 weeks in the presence of 0.6 mg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and examined by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis with anti-gicerin antisera. L929 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and the following antibiotics and antimycotics: 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Several gicerin-positive cell lines (l-lGs) were obtained and employed for further experiments. s-Gicerin expressing L929 cell lines (27Taira E. Takaha N. Taniura H. Kim C.-H. Miki N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were renamed l-sGs. All these established cell lines were grown in the same medium containing 0.1 mg/ml G418. Cell aggregation experiments were carried out as reported previously(27Taira E. Takaha N. Taniura H. Kim C.-H. Miki N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 36Urushihara H. Ozaki H.S. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1979; 70: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions (2 × 106 cells/ml) were prepared from each subconfluent monolayer. In some experiments, antibodies were added at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and kept on ice for 30 min before starting the aggregation assay. The assay was carried out by incubating the cell suspension at 37°C in a CO2 incubator without agitation. A small aliquot was withdrawn every 15 min after gentle mixing, and the particles were counted in a hemocytometer. The degree of cell aggregation was estimated by the index Nt/No according to conventional methods(17Tanaka H. Matsui T. Agata A. Tomura M. Kubota I. McFarland K.C. Kohr B. Lee A. Phillips H.S.

The index No was the total particle number at the initial incubation time (0 min), and the index Nt was the total particle number at the incubation time t. Experiments were performed four times and the scores averaged. Photographs were taken of cells in suspension after 1 h of incubation. Ciliary ganglions (CGs) were dissected from the 8-day chick embryo. They were treated with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA for 20 min at room temperature, then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and dissociated by gentle pipetting. Resultant single cells were preincubated on a plastic dish for 1 h to let non-neuronal cells attach to the dish(29Taniura H. Kuo C.-H. Hayashi Y. Miki N. J.

The nonattached ciliary ganglion neurons were plated on feeder layers of confluent gicerin transfectants or parental L929 cells grown in 30-mm dishes (~500 CG cells/dish) and co-incubated for 24 h(39Doherty P.

The cultures were fixed with Zamboni's solution, and the CG neurons were detected by immunocytochemistry with anti-MAP2 antibodies(40Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Garner C.C. Trends Neurosci. 1991; 14: 193-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The relative length of the neurites from the MAP2-positive cells were judged under microscopy, and the same experiments were performed at least three times. In some experiments, anti-gicerin polyclonal antibodies were added both to the preincubated CG cells and the feeder cells 1 h before starting the co-culture, and anti-MAP2 monoclonal antibodies were employed for detection of neurons with neurites. Cell adhesion experiments were carried out as reported previously(27Taira E. Takaha N. Taniura H. Kim C.-H. Miki N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Four-ml aliquots of each test sample containing 10 ng/ml of purified NOF (28Hayashi Y. Miki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14269-14278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were spotted on a 35-mm test dish coated with nitrocellulose and incubated for 1 h in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37°C. The dishes were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS three times and preincubated with the medium containing 10% FCS for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Two-ml aliquots of the cell suspension (2 × 106 cells/ml) were plated on the test dishes. To assess the inhibition of adhesion activity by antibodies against gicerin, the cells were preincubated with the antibodies at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml on ice for 30 min before plating on the test dishes. The dishes were kept in CO2 at 37°C for 30 min, then washed twice with Hanks' solution containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and fixed with Zamboni's solution. Adhesion to the dishes was then assessed by phase-contrast microscopy. An s-gicerin cDNA clone was used to prepare a probe for screening a λgt 11 chicken gizzard library. We obtained seven independent positive clones and determined their sequences, after subcloning into phagemid Bluescript II SK(-). We obtained cDNA clones that encoded sequences that differed from that reported for s-gicerin and rescreened the same library to obtain four clones that encoded a novel protein. We found that the novel l-gicerin cDNA (EMBL/DDBJ/GSDB/NCBI accession number D49849) had a 121-bp insert in the cytoplasmic domain that encoded 63 amino acid residues and produced a frameshift to form a larger tail with a distinct sequence (Fig. 1 and 2). The cytoplasmic domain of l-gicerin showed no significant homology with known molecules. Analysis of the extracellular domain did not reveal any difference between these gicerin isoforms. To confirm the existence of two distinct gicerin mRNA species, total RNA was extracted from chicken gizzard smooth muscle and analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 3A). As expected, two sizes of RT-PCR products were detected when the G-5′ and G-3′ primers that span the insert were used. Furthermore, only one product was amplified when the I-3′ primer, based on the insert sequence, was used instead of G-3′. We also obtained a single product when the 5′ primer I-5′, based on a segment of the insert, was used with G-3′. Digestion of these PCR products with SacI, which has one site conserved in both isoforms (underlined in Fig. 1), generated products with the expected sizes (Fig. 3B). To produce an antiserum specific for l-gicerin, we utilized two multiple antigenic peptides found in the cytoplasmic domain of l-gicerin but not s-gicerin (Fig. 2). Immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-gicerin antibodies prepared previously or with antibodies prepared against the l-gicerin-specific peptides. To examine the selectivity of the anti-l-gicerin antisera, we first immunoprecipitated both gicerin isoforms from Nonidet P-40 gizzard extracts with anti-gicerin antibodies and then performed immunoblot analysis. Only the upper band of the doublet detected by the anti-gicerin antiserum was recognized by anti-l-gicerin antiserum (Fig. 4). Conversely, the upper band was detected by both antisera in Western blot analysis, when immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-l-gicerin antibodies. We performed immunoblot analysis following digestion of the Nonidet P-40 extracts of the gizzard with N-glycosidase F, since the predicted amino acid sequence of gicerin has eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The digested gicerins were detected as a doublet band of 70 and 64 kDa, and only the upper band of the doublet was recognized with anti-l-gicerin antiserum (Fig. 5). The predicted molecular masses of l- and s-gicerin were calculated to be 69.0 and 63.9 kDa, respectively, which matches that observed for the deglycosylated gicerins. These studies demonstrate that the l-gicerin transcript encodes the larger isoform of gicerin. Next, we compared the expression of gicerin isoforms in the nervous system by Western blot analysis with these two antisera. Previous studies revealed that gicerin was highly expressed in the embryonic retina, cerebellum, and optic tectum and thereafter levels gradually decrease during development. We found that s-gicerin was expressed in the retina, l-gicerin in the optic tectum, and both in the cerebellum (Fig. 6, A and B).Figure 4:Immunoprecipitation analysis of chicken gizzard gicerin. The Nonidet P-40-extracted fraction of chicken gizzard and the immunoprecipitated samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing condition.

The big band of about 53 kDa (B) is a degenerated product of that gicerin that was sometimes observed in repeatedly frozen samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The l-gicerin cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA1 to construct pcDNA1-lG. The construct was co-transfected into the mouse fibroblast cell L929 with a neomycin resistance vector pMAM-neo, and cells were selected with G418. Cell lines were screened for high levels of l-gicerin expression by immunofluorescent cytochemistry and Western blot analysis with anti-gicerin antiserum. We chose three clones (l-lG-1, -3, and -5) for further experiments. While s-gicerin transfectants exhibited a single band of 86 kDa(27Taira E. Takaha N. Taniura H. Kim C.-H. Miki N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), l-gicerin lines exhibited a doublet band of 92 and 84 kDa (Fig. 7A). Appearance of a lower band of l-gicerin might reflect proteolytic degraded fragments, since only the upper band was detectable by l-gicerin-specific antiserum, and the intensity of the upper band decreased as the lower band increased following prolonged storage (data not shown). Following digestion with N-glycosidase F, the molecular size of the recombinantly expressed proteins decreased to 64 kDa for s-gicerin and 70 and 66 kDa for l-gicerin. Only the upper band of l-gicerin transfectants was detected by anti-l-gicerin antiserum before and after N-glycosidase F digestion. The deglycosylated product of s-gicerin corresponded to the predicted molecular mass of 63.9 kDa (Fig. 7B). Only the upper band of the deglycosylated products from l-gicerin transfectants corresponded to the predicted mass of 69.0 kDa, while the lower band may be due to degradation after extraction. In previous studies, we have shown that s-gicerin possesses homophilic cell aggregation activity. To investigate possible differences in the functional activities of s- and l-gicerin, we first compared their ability to mediate homophilic adhesion (Fig. 8). Analysis of multiple transfectants of both types revealed that cell lines expressing the same gicerin isoform exhibited nearly identical cell aggregation activity (Fig. 9). Previous studies of multiple s-gicerin transfectants revealed a similar pattern across cell lines(27Taira E. Takaha N. Taniura H. Kim C.-H. Miki N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 861-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cell aggregation was inhibited by the addition of anti-gicerin antibodies, as shown previously. Comparison of the degree of cell aggregation activity revealed that s-gicerin transfectants aggregated more strongly than l-gicerin transfectants. These findings suggest that the cytoplasmic domain influences homophilic binding activity.Figure 9:Aggregation pattern of gicerin transfectants.

https://openalex.org/W2062702507,"The subunit structure of mitochondrial DNA polymerase from <i>Drosophila</i> embryos has been examined by a combination of physical and immunological methods. A highly specific rabbit antiserum directed against the native enzyme was developed and found to recognize specifically its two subunits in immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses. That and the potent inhibition by the rabbit antiserum of the DNA polymerase and 3′→5′ exonuclease activities of the nearly homogeneous mitochondrial DNA polymerase provide strong evidence for the physical association of the 3′→5′ exonuclease with the two subunit enzyme. An immunoprecipitation analysis of crude enzyme fractions showed that the two subunits of <i>Drosophila</i> mitochondrial DNA polymerase are intact, and an <i>in situ</i> gel proteolysis analysis showed that they are structurally distinct. Template-primer DNA binding studies demonstrated formation of a stable and discrete enzyme-DNA complex in the absence of accessory proteins. Photochemical cross-linking of the complexes by UV light indicated that the α but not the β subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase makes close contact with DNA, and limited digestion of the native enzyme with trypsin showed that an ~65-kDa proteolytic fragment of the α subunit retains the DNA binding function."

https://openalex.org/W2164458355,"The thermodynamics of assembly of the allophycocyanin hexamer was examined employing hydrostatic pressures in the range of 1 bar to 2.4 kbar and temperatures of 20 to -12°C, the latter made possible by the decrease of the freezing point of water under pressure. The existence of two processes, dissociation of the hexamer into dimers, (αβ)3→3 (αβ), and dissociation of the αβ dimers into monomers, (αβ) →α+β have been recognized previously by changes in the absorbance and fluorescence of the tetrapyrrolic chromophores owing to added ligands. The same changes are observed in the absence of ligands at pressures of under 2.4 kbar and temperatures down to -12°C. On decompression from 2.4 kbar at 0°C, appreciable hysteresis and a persistent loss of 50% in the absorbance at 653 nm is observed. It results from the conformational drift of the isolated subunits and is reduced to 10% when the highest pressure is limited to 1.6 kbar. The thermodynamic parameters of the reaction α+β→αβ can be determined from pressure effects on perchlorate solutions of allophycocyanin, which consist of dimers alone. Their previous knowledge permits estimation, under suitable hypotheses, of the thermodynamic parameters of the reaction 3(αβ) →(αβ)3→from the overall pressure effects on the hexamers. Both association reactions have positive enthalpy changes, and the whole hexamer assembly is made possible by the excess entropy.

Both association reactions have positive enthalpy changes, and the whole hexamer assembly is made possible by the excess entropy. Allophycocyanin is one of the phycobiliproteins of phycobilisomes, the accessory light-harvesting complexes in cyanobacteria and red algae. Allophycocyanin has been isolated as a trimeric species (αβ)3 (Zilinskas et al., 1978; MacColl et al., 1981) of 110 kDa to which we shall refer here as a hexamer. Conversion of (αβ)3 into αβ dimers is obtained by the addition of 1 M perchlorate (MacColl et al., 1971; MacColl et al., 1981; Huang et al., 1987) or by lowering the pH (MacColl et al., 1980). Dissociation of αβ dimers into α+β monomers has been achieved only in the presence of urea at 8 M concentration (Erokhima and Krasnoviskii, 1974). Hydrostatic pressure has been used successfully to explore the thermodynamics and mechanism of assembly of oligomeric proteins. (Silva and Weber, 1993). In this report, we describe how the dissociation of (αβ)3 into αβ dimers and then into α+β monomers occurs when the solutions of the protein are subjected to hydrostatic pressures in the range of atmospheric to 3 kbar and temperatures in the range of 10 to -11°C. The decrease in the freezing point of water under pressure makes it possible to reach a temperature of -20°C at 2.4 kbar while maintaining the liquid state. In the absence of perchlorate or urea, complete dissociation of allophycocyanin takes place only at these low temperatures, and this has enabled us to show that the process of dimer dissociation by the cold results in a state very similar to that obtained by addition of a classical chemical denaturant, urea, but as a freely displaceable equilibrium. Separation of the two sequential processes of hexamer and dimer dissociation cannot be unequivocally done from the spectral changes under pressure or temperature alone. However the isolation of the pressure effects on the αβ dimers by starting with allophycocyanin solutions in 1 M perchlorate, in which the dissociation of the hexamer into dimers is complete, has permitted us to obtain the volume and enthalpy changes of the association of the monomers into dimers. Starting with these data, we have derived the corresponding quantities for the reaction (αβ)3 3 αβ from the overall spectral changes with pressure and temperature, in absence of any added ligands. We thus provide a complete thermodynamic description of the pressure dissociation of a heterohexamer, (αβ)3, into its ultimate subunits, the α and β monomers. The generation and measurement of pressure and the use of spectroscopic methods to determine the degree of dissociation, the changes in volume (ΔV) and the changes in the standard free energy of association of the aggregate (ΔG) are described elsewhere (Paladini and Weber, 1981a, 1981b; Silva et al., 1986; Weber, 1986). The pressure bomb utilized in this study has been described previously (Paladini and Weber, 1981a). The bomb temperature, measured with a thermocouple, was decreased below room temperature using a methanol circulator and thermostat. Condensation on the bomb windows was avoided by passing a stream of dry nitrogen. For absorbance measurements, the pressure bomb was placed in the sample compartment of a photodiode array spectrophotometer (3000 Array, of SLM-Aminco). Fluorescence spectra, excited at 600 nm, were determined with a double monochromator spectrofluorometer controlled by software from ISS (Champaign, IL). We recall that change in volume upon reaction, ΔV, may be obtained by two different procedures (Ruan and Weber, 1989). One involves the change in degree of dissociation with pressure at constant concentration (ΔVP); the other involves the change in pressure required to reach the same degree of dissociation at two different protein concentrations (ΔVC). Unless otherwise stated the values designated here as ΔV are exclusively ΔVP. Polarizations of fluorescence were measured and corrected for window birefringence as described by Paladini and Weber (1981a). The sample was excited at 600 nm, and the emission reached the photodetector through an R-59 cut-off filter. Allophycocyanin from Spirulina platensis was purchased from Sigma, dissolved in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and stored at 4°C. Tris•HCl (100 mM, pH 7.5) was employed in all the pressure experiments because of the minimal variation of its pK with pressure (Neumann et al., 1973). Decreasing temperature causes an increase in pH of 0.03 pH units/°C. Thus, at -10°C, an increase in pH of approximately 1 unit with respect to the value at 20°C is expected. The αβ dimers were obtained by the addition of 1 M NaClO4 to Tris•HCl buffer followed by adjustment of the pH. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; only two bands were observed corresponding to the α and β subunits. The pressure was increased in steps of 200 bar, allowing 15 min for equilibration at each pressure and temperature prior to recording measurements. Control experiments showed that changes in absorbance and fluorescence spectra were completed within 5 min and remained stable for 90 min thereafter. In its hexameric form, native allophycocyanin has absorbance peaks at 620 and 653 nm (MacColl et al., 1981). (Fig. 1). The addition of 1 M perchlorate to the hexameric allophycocyanin results in its dissociation into αβ dimers (MacColl et al., 1980, 1981, 1983), which have an absorbance maximum at 615 nm (Fig. 2). The dissociation of αβ dimers into separate α and β monomers has so far been observed only in the presence of a high concentration of urea (8 M), when the absorbance by the prosthetic group is reduced to about 6% of the native protein. (Erokhima and Krasnoviskii, 1974; Scheer and Weber) (Fig. 2). The 620 nm absorption band of the intact protein (Fig. 1) has been assigned to the chromophores present in the αβ dimers, whereas the 653 nm peak that appears when hexamer is formed has been attributed to exciton coupling between chromophores in adjacent αβ dimers within the hexamer (MacColl et al., 1981; Csatorday et al. 1984; Beck and Sauer, 1992). From the absorption at wavelengths longer than 620 nm, it follows that the integrated dimer absorbance is expected to be 0.27 of that of the hexamer while dissociation into denatured monomers would lower it further to less than 0.06 of the intact aggregate.Figure 2:Continuous lines, absorption spectra of allophycocyanin in 1 M perchlorate at 0°C. From top to bottom: 1.0 bar, 0.8 kbar, 1.0 kbar, 1.2 kbar, 1.4 kbar, 1.8 kbar, 2.0 kbar, 2.2 kbar, and 2.4 kbar.

Protein concentrations, 15 μg/ml.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a previous study (MacColl, 1983) it was shown that the hexameric species (αβ)3→of allophycocyanin on excitation of the chromophores at 600 nm exhibits a fluorescence emission with a peak at 662 nm, whereas the emission from the αβ dimers obtained by the addition of 1 M perchlorate has a maximum at 640 nm, with a lower yield. The addition of 8 M urea, which dissociates αβ into α+β, decreases the fluorescence intensity without further spectral shifts. Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence spectra of solutions in neutral buffer (a), 1 M perchlorate solutions (b), at apressure of 2.4 kbar at 0°C (c), and in 8 M urea (dashed line). The fluorescence changes follow quantitatively the corresponding absorbance changes. The limiting fluorescence emission spectrum is very similar to that seen in the presence of urea so that the data of both absorption or fluorescence can be used to monitor the dissociation of hexamer into monomers. By comparison of Figure 1:, Figure 2:, it is possible to deduce that by the application of pressures of up to 2.4 kbar at 0°C, the two sequential reactions, (αβ)3 3 (αβ) and αβ→α+β occur with the absorbance, and also fluorescence, changes belonging to them running smoothly into each other as dissociation proceeds. Isolation of the corresponding thermodynamic parameters becomes a matter of fitting the data to a preassigned model. Success in this procedure critically depends on the hypotheses made on the spectral characteristics assigned to the reactions and on the precision of the measurements. To minimize the uncertainties involved, we used a more direct procedure. Allophycocyanin in 1 M perchlorate solution is in the form of dimers, and the thermodynamic parameters for the dimer-monomer equilibrium can be determined by the effect of pressure on these solutions following experience with several other protein dimers (Silva and Weber, 1993). Making use of this data, we can set up the equations corresponding to the two-step dissociation of the hexamers into α and β monomers and derive the thermodynamic parameters of the dissociation of the hexamer into dimers brought about by the application of pressure. Using perchlorate-treated samples, we were thus able to monitor the effects of hydrostatic pressure and low temperatures upon the dissociation of the αβ dimer without the complications that result from a coupled dissociation of the hexamer. Fig. 2 shows the absorbance spectra of the αβ dimer (1 M perchlorate solutions) as the pressure is stepwise increased to 2.4 kbar at 0°C. At the latter pressure, the spectrum almost coincides with the spectrum observed when 8 M urea is added to the perchlorate-treated protein at atmospheric pressure and room temperature (22°C, dashed line). As reported by Chen and Kao(1977) and Chen and Berns(1978), the circular dichroism at 222 nm of biliproteins denatured by urea shows changes parallel to those in the visible absorption spectrum, so that both methods are equivalent as indirect probes of biliprotein unfolding. The observation that application of pressure brings about changes similar to those of urea denaturation indicates that the separated α and β monomers are unstable and that pressure separation is followed by unfolding to an undetermined extent. Therefore the values of the standard changes in free energy ΔG, and volume ΔV, on association, are those for the conversion of unfolded monomers into a folded dimer. Fig. 4 shows the decrease in the maximal absorbance of the αβ allophycocyanin dimer in 1 M perchlorate as pressure is increased at 0°C. The decompression pathway (lower curve) exhibits a slight hysteresis. After decompression, the spectral properties of the dimer were fully recovered, indicating complete reversibility of the dissociation reaction at this protein concentration. The application of high pressure (2.4 kbar) at 22°C promoted a fast dissociation (to γ= 0.47) that reached a plateau in less than 5 min and was practically constant over longer times. Degrees of dimer dissociation (γ) were calculated on the assumption that the plateau values of absorption or emission observed at pressures close to atmospheric pressure correspond to zero dissociation and at highest pressures (or lowest temperatures) correspond to complete dissociation (see as example Figure 1:, Figure 2:). The relation of the degree of dissociation to the dissociation equilibrium constant (K0) for a dimer is K0=4CDγ2/(1-γ)(Eq. 1) where CD is the total concentration of protein expressed as dimer. In terms of the characteristic dimer concentration C1/2D at which γ = 1/2, becomes C1/2D/(2CD)=γ2/(1-γ)(Eq. 2) Fig. 4, inset, shows the plot of ln(γ2/(1 - γ)) against pressure for the data of the figure. The volume change of association (ΔV) and the dissociation constant at 1 bar calculated for the reaction αβ→α+β are summarized in Table 1. The volume change found for association of the α and β monomers (104 ml•mol-1) is of the magnitude observed for other dimer-monomer equilibria (Silva and Weber, 1993).TABLE I Open table in a new tab It is also possible to monitor the dissociation and denaturation of allophycocyanin hexamers by measuring the decrease in fluorescence in neutral buffers solution at 0°C (Fig. 5). The fluorescence at the highest pressure resembles that obtained with 8 M urea, a further indication that the combined effects of pressure and low temperature results in a state of the tetrapyrrolic pigments that mimics that of denaturation at room temperature by urea. Returning pressure and temperature to initial conditions resulted in recovery of the fluorescence properties of the protein parallel to the changes in absorbance, and the values of ΔV and K0 from the fluorescence data are in close agreement with those of absorbance (Table 1). To determine the protein concentration dependence of the pressure effects on the dimer, compression at 0°C was performed at two different protein concentrations. Fig. 6 shows that the pressure curve was uniformly shifted to higher pressures at the higher protein concentration. The pressure difference at γ= 0.5, Δp1/2 is 330 bar, while the theoretical for ΔV = 100 ml mol-1 is Δp1/2 = 400 bar. The 20% difference of Δp1/2 between observed and computed values is within the range generally observed in other dimers (Silva and Silveira, 1992; Silva and Weber, 1993). The dissociation reaction was also examined by varying the temperature at constant pressure (Fig. 7). Starting at atmospheric pressure at 22°C (solid symbol in Fig. 7, upper left) an increase in pressure to 1.6 kbar produced a very small change in absorbance (filled circles), but a considerably larger one at 2.4 kbar (empty circles). At 2.4 kbar and -11°C, the final absorption ratio reached was nearly the same as observed by increase in pressure at 0°C (Fig. 4). At 1.6 kbar, the freezing point is -9°C, and while the maximum dissociation reached is thus limited, the slope of the change in absorbance with temperature is such as to indicate that the lower limit of absorbance would be reached at a temperature not much different than that at 2.4 kbar. In the dissociation of the hexamer into dimers, the degree of dissociation ϵ is related to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant by the equation K0=27∈3CH2/(1−∈)(Eq. 3) where CH is the concentration of protein expressed as hexamer. In terms of the characteristic concentration C1/2H at which ϵ = 1/2, reads [C1/2H/(2CH)]2=∈3/(1-∈)(Eq. 4) If the constants C1/2H and C1/2D, as well as the protein concentration as hexamer, CH, are given, and can be coupled by a simple iterative procedure to yield the values of γ and ϵ at which, at any fixed conditions of temperature and pressure, ∈CH=(1-γ)CD(Eq. 5) In this resolution, the characteristic values of C1/2H and C1/2D at each pressure, C1/2H(p) and C1/2D(p), are related to the corresponding values at atmospheric pressure, C1/2H(0) and C1/2D(0), by the equations C1/2H(p)=C1/2H(0)exp(pΔVH/RT)C1/2D(p)=C1/2D(0)exp(pΔVD/RT)(Eq. 6) where ΔVH and ΔVD are the standard volume changes of the respective association reactions 3(αβ) → (αβ)3 and α+β→αβ. The parameters for the dimer monomer equilibrium C1/2D(0) and ΔVD are known from the observations on perchlorate solutions of allophycocyanin so that the coupling of the sequential equilibria depends upon the choice of the parameters C1/2H(0) and ΔVH. Employment of the independently obtained data on dimer dissociation in perchlorate solutions involves the assumption that the thermodynamic parameters of the dissociation of the dimer in 1 M perchlorate do not materially differ from those that correspond to the dimers generated on dissociation of the hexamers in the absence of perchlorate. We consider this uncertainty preferable to that involved in the simultaneous determination of four unknown parameters instead of two. If we thus employ the two parameters obtained from the observations on 1 M perchlorate solution, we can compute, for any pair of the parameters, C1/2H(0) and ΔVH, the proportions of hexamers, dimers, and monomers at each pressure. As we know (Figure 2:, Figure 3:) that the respective contributions to absorption at 636 nm (see below) or to fluorescence are in the ratios 1:0.27:0.05, we can construct the spectral change curve corresponding to the parameters employed, C1/2H(0) and ΔVH, and compare it with the experimental observations. Fig. 1 shows that increasing pressure to 2.4 kbar at 0°C results in a progressive decline in both absorption peaks at 620 and 653 nm but with the decrease in absorption at 620 nm occurring at higher pressures than at 653 nm. The 653 nm peak has been assigned to exciton splitting of the absorbance owing to interaction of nearby dimer chromophores within the hexamer, which can be affected by pressure somewhat differently than the overall absorbance. The average absorption across the whole spectrum should be unaffected by the exciton splitting because the exciton splitting is expected to occur with conservation of the oscillator strength. The monotonic decrease in absorption over the whole band cannot be resolved into contributions from hexamers and dimers individually represented by any specific region of the spectrum; instead we must take the integrated absorption over the whole band as a measure of the hexamer dissociation. The solid line in Fig. 8 corresponds to the unsmoothed average absorption between the limits of 620 and 653 nm. It virtually coincides with the absorption change in the center of mass of the whole band, at 636 nm. This latter set of values was used as characteristic of the changes in hexamer concentration. At 0°C and 2.4 kbar, the absorption throughout the whole band reaches very low limiting values, indicating that for this range of pressures dissociation at 0°C of hexamers into the α and β monomers is virtually complete. Best fitting of the observed spectral changes obtains for KH/KD = 0.07, or C1/2H = 0.22 ± 0.06 nM and ΔVH = 100 ± 5 ml mol-1. The fractions of hexamers, dimers, and monomers computed for these values of C1/2H(0) and ΔVH, together with their fractional contribution to the absorbance deduced from Figure 1:, Figure 2: permits calculation of a spectral curve quite close to the experimental points of decrease in absorption at 636 nm at 0°C, as shown in Fig. 9. The difference in the spectral curves that assume dimer contributions of 0.27 (full line) and 0 (broken line) is generally insignificant. The cause is clearly the minimal dimer fraction present at any degree of dissociation, so that we virtually observe a hexamer-monomer equilibrium, in which we are able to separate the constants characteristic of the two stages because of the previous observations on the perchlorate solutions that independently define the parameters C1/2D(0) and ΔVD. We note that the coincidence of the observed and expected absorbance changes does not depend on the exact value of C1/2D so long as C1/2D/C1/2H≫ 1. This relation between the dissociation constants appears almost inevitable from the smooth changes in absorption (Fig. 1) or fluorescence (Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:) of solutions of allophycocyanin in buffer compressed at 0°C toward the corresponding spectra observed in 8 M urea and the equally smooth changes in absorbance on cooling the solutions below 0°C (Fig. 7). However, we note that the conclusions reached by the agreement of the data of Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5: with the result of the computations (Fig. 9) substantially depend on specific hypotheses about the molecular origin of the absorption spectrum and on the assumption that the dissociation constant for the dimer-monomer equilibrium in buffer is not significantly smaller than that determined for the dimer in 1 M perchlorate.Figure 9:Spectral curves constructed according to the proportions of hexamers, dimers and monomers calculated with use of the parameters C1/2D = 3.2 nM, C1/2H = 0.22 nM, ΔVD = 104 ml mol-1, ΔVH = 100 ml mol-1.

Though there were considerable differences between compression and decompression associations calculated from the absorbances at both 653 and 620 nm, reassociation on decompression appears to be virtually complete for the 620 nm absorbance but only about 50% complete for the 653 nm absorbance, indicating an imperfect association that does not restore completely the conditions necessary for the recovery of the initial exciton splitting. This imperfect reassociation, which bespeaks a loss of free energy after dissociation, evidently arises from changes in the conformation (“conformational drift”) of the separated subunits of oligomeric proteins. It is observed in the dissociation of some dimers by dilution (Xu and Weber, 1980; Silva and Silveira, 1991; Erijman et al., 1993) and in other dimers and higher order aggregates dissociated by hydrostatic pressure (King and Weber, 1986; Silva et al., 1986; Ruan and Weber, 1989, 1993). The theory of these effects is discussed by Weber(1986, 1992). When the free energy loss by conformational drift is not too large, reassociation of subunits on decompression can be virtually complete, but the recovered aggregate shows persistent changes in properties characteristic of a material of “fading memory” (Gurtin, 1968; Truesdell, 1985). In the present case, the hysteresis and the incomplete recovery of properties is sufficient to establish the existence of new hexamer-dimer-monomer equilibria with modified thermodynamic parameters. Fig. 10 shows also that the absorbance at 653 nm is almost fully reversible after compression to 1.6 kbar at 0°C, conditions that bring about half-dissociation. The hysteresis of the decompression curve is much less pronounced, and the reassociation is nearly complete. Similar results have been previously described for the pressure dissociation of the apoprotein of tryptophan synthase β2 subunit (Silva et al., 1986). They require that the loss of free energy of association owing to conformational drift increase with the degree of dissociation reached by the protein aggregate and that the major part of the loss of free energy occur at conditions of nearly complete dissociation. The enthalpy change in the overall hexamer-monomer equilibrium can be estimated from the change in free energy with temperature, as derived from the corresponding absorbances at 636 nm. The experimental data permitted application of this procedure in the interval of temperatures of 22 to -11°C under a pressure of 2.27 kbar. However, the interpretation of the slope in the plot of d(ΔG/T)/d(1/T) is not at all unequivocal. Equating this slope to the standard enthalpy change, the classic van't Hoff method, yields ΔH = 26 kcal mol-1 per dissociated particle. Employing the assumptions and method of calculation proposed by Weber(1995), ΔH = 39 kcal mol-1. Table 1 gives the van't Hoff enthalpy for the association of monomers into dimers as 14.3 kcal mol-1. Further analysis of these data does not seen profitable without better characterization of the degree of unfolding of the monomers released on dimer dissociation. Regardless of exact values, all calculations confirm that the association of the subunits is an entropy-driven phenomenon with substantial positive enthalpies that oppose association. The pressure dissociation of the aggregates is determined by the preferential destabilization of the apolar contacts (Weber, 1993). This destabilization results in a sufficient increase in the enthalpy of association to shift the equilibrium toward dissociation, while the changes in entropy on compression are much less important. At 2.4 kbar, lowering the temperature from 22°C, at which most of the protein is associated into hexamers, causes a 5.5-fold increase in fluorescence polarization (Fig. 11). This increase is similar to that observed when allophycocyanin hexamers are converted into αβ dimers by the addition of perchlorate (MacColl et al., 1980; Canaani et al., 1980; Holzwarth et al., 1990). The low polarization of the hexamer at 22°C, 0.04 is far too small to result from rotational diffusion and was attributed by these authors to the electronic energy transfer among the prosthetic fluorophores in adjacent dimers. The increase of polarization as the αβ dimer is formed must then reflect the loss of depolarization by energy transfer owing to disappearance of the exciton coupling. In agreement with observations shown in Fig. 10, the fluorescence polarization, like the absorbance at 653 nm, shows a pronounced hysteresis as the temperature is returned to 22°C. Recent studies of the effects of low temperatures on protein folding have shown that supercooling of a single-chain protein in solution causes its denaturation (Sturtevant, 1977; Griko et al., 1988; Privalov, 1990). The studies of protein dissociation by hydrostatic pressure carried out thus far have been limited to temperatures above 0°C, and the relatively small changes in protein conformation that have been detected in the separated subunits have been considered to be the result of a limited conformational drift, which never achieves the structural disorganization characteristic of protein denaturation (King and Weber, 1986; Silva and Weber, 1993). The decrease in the freezing point of water that occurs under pressure makes it possible to expand the accessible temperature range down to -20°C at a hydrostatic pressure of 2.4 kbar. Thus one can attain, under equilibrium conditions, the temperatures of the supercooled solutions in which polypeptide denaturation has been observed. The temperature effects observed at constant pressure show that the association of allophycocyanin is maintained by a large entropy change that opposes a considerably positive enthalpy change, a situation that appears to obtain generally for the association of subunits into oligomers (Lauffer, 1975; Weber, 1993; Silva and Weber, 1993). Allophycocyanin dissociation shows more clearly than other cases the entropic contribution to the protein assembly process, since at room temperature, the state of aggregation of the protein is barely affected by pressure alone. Table 1 establishes the entropy-driven character of the reversible folding and association of α+β subunits of allophycocyanin into dimers; thus an increase in entropy drives the entire process of association of the unfolded monomers into the complete allophycocyanin hexamer. Allophycocyanin compression and decompression curves exhibit hysteresis that is more pronounced the greater the extent of dissociation. Hysteresis in the compression-decompression cycle has been observed in most of the oligomers studied (Silva and Weber, 1993). It is attributed to occurrence of a process that follows the separation of the subunits and reduces their affinity for each other. It also results in delayed recovery of the original spectroscopic and enzymic properties of proteins after decompression (King and Weber, 1986; Silva et al. 1986; Ruan and Weber, 1989). As discussed elsewhere (Weber, 1986) this phenomenon appears to be the consequence of the substitution of intersubunit contacts by solvent-subunit contacts. The phenomenon of hysteresis requires that after a reduction in pressure, the degree of dissociation reaches a value that maintains itself for a time, which is at least of the order of the whole compression-decompression cycle (Everett and Smith, 1955; Cooper, 1988; Silva and Weber, 1993). This behavior is well known in the mechanics of solids as characteristic of “materials of fading memory” (Truesdell, 1985), and the observation of the effects of hydrostatic pressure on many oligomers shows that they fall naturally in this category. While materials of fading memory may be expected to share many features of their thermodynamics and dynamics (Gurtin, 1968), proteins are far more heterogeneous than most materials in this category and will inevitably require a theory peculiar to themselves. The volume change of association found for hexamer-αβ dimer equilibrium (100 ml/mol) is intermediate between the one found for dimers (60-150 ml/mol) and that for tetramers (around 220 ml/mol) (Silva and Weber, 1993). Volume changes calculated from data at different temperatures are very similar (Table 1), suggesting that the conformational drift of the monomers separated by compression at different temperatures does not influence appreciably the volume change on association, at least in this case. The observation that the dissociation constants for the hexamer into dimers is approximately 200 times smaller than the dissociation constant of the dimer into monmers in dilute neutral buffer solutions predicates that the former dissociation is inevitably followed by the latter and that the dimer is not an intermediate form that can exist in appreciable concentration in such media, although it is stabilized by 1 M perchlorate. The absence of dimer intermediates has been observed in the dissociation of the tetramers of glyceraldehide phosphate dehydrogenase (Ruan and Weber, 1989) and glycogen phosphorylase (Ruan and Weber, 1993). Its physiological significance may lie in the need for rapid hydrolytic removal of the protein following the initial stage of dissociation. The reversibility observed in the reassembly of the αβ dimers after they are converted into α+β subunits by the combined use of pressure and low temperature indicates that inside the cell this step in the assembly process of phycobiliproteins can occur spontaneously. On the other hand, the association into native hexamers may require a particular set of conditions or the presence of cofactors in order to proceed inside the cell, since it is not completely reversible after decompression to atmospheric pressure or increase in temperature, in the dilute buffered solutions studied here. However, the extent of hexamer recovery is proportional to temperature and protein concentration, and inside the cyanobacterial cell the concentration of phycobiliproteins is extremely high. Thus it is also possible that the hexamer assembly proceeds driven by the law of mass action, with some aid from the temperature. The dissociation-denaturation behavior of allophycocyanin observed in this study is consistent with previous results obtained on intact cyanobacteria (Foguel et al., 1992). With them, the application of high hydrostatic pressure at room temperature resulted in a strong emission with a red shift to 662 nm when the cells were excited with green light. This result suggested that in these conditions, pressure disconnected the phycobilisomes from the thylakoid membranes resulting in the emission of the terminal phycobilisome component, namely allophycocyanin. The emission vanished when a combination of low temperature and high pressure was used, an indication of dissociation and denaturation of the phycobilisomes components. In agreement with those results, we find here that allophycocyanin does not dissociate at room temperature. Dissociation is only observed when pressure is increased at low temperature. Additional studies with intact phycobilisomes and their isolated protein components are in progress in order to obtain further insights into the assembly process. We thank Dr. J. L. Silva for helpful discussions and suggestions during this work and Dr. Martha Sorenson for help with the final version of the manuscript."

The Galα1-4Gal-binding adhesin of S. suis was purified to homogeneity by ultrasonic treatment, fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pigeon ovomucoid, a glycoprotein with Galα1-4Gal terminals, was used to detect the adhesin by blotting. The purified adhesin appeared as single band of an apparent size of 18 kDa and of a pI of 6.4; no disulfide bridges were present.

The first event in the establishment of infectious diseases is the adhesion of bacteria to the surface of host cells(1Beachey E.H. J. Infect. Dis. 1981; 143: 325-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Adhesins mediating this interaction are thus essential factors in bacterial pathogenesis and important virulence factors(2Ofek I.

Many adhesins act as lectins, recognizing specific carbohydrate moieties on host cell surface glycoconjugates. Most of the knowledge on bacterial carbohydrate-binding adhesins is derived from studies on Gram-negative bacteria (reviewed in (4Ofek I. Sharon N. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

The identification and characterization of the molecules responsible for the interaction of the bacteria with host cells would give valuable information for the understanding of the pathogenesis of the infection and is a key factor in the development of new antibacterial agents and vaccines. In previous studies, the binding of S. suis bacteria to host cells was found to be mediated by an adhesion activity which recognizes the disaccharide galactosyl-α1-4-galactose(10Haataja S.

The S. suis strains studied have been described before(13Kurl D.N. Haataja S. Finne J. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 384-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain 628 was obtained from Dr H. C.

The bacteria were maintained in Todd-Hewitt broth at -20°C and were grown on sheep blood agar plates overnight at 37°C under anaerobic conditions (Gas-Pak system). The bacteria were harvested from the plates, washed twice, and suspended in phosphate buffer A (10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4) and adjusted to a concentration that gave an A600 nm of 0.5 at 1:100 dilution. Erythrocytes obtained from healthy adults were washed and treated by sialidase as described before (14Korhonen T.K. Finne J. Korhonen T.K. Dawes E.A. Mäkel ä P.H.

Protein determination was carried by an adaptation of the method described by Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216261) Google Scholar) on polystyrene Microstrips using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate. The absorbance at A595 nm was measured by SLT Labinstruments Easy Reader SF plus ELISA reader. Pigeon ovomucoid was labeled with 125I using the IODOBEAD method according to the instructions of the manufacturer. A total amount of 0.3 mCi of Na125I was added to 250 μg of ovomucoid in 250 μl of buffer A, and a bead was added. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with occasional shaking. The reaction mixture was removed from the bead, and 0.5 M NaI was added to a concentration of 10 mM. Nonincorporated iodine was separated by chromatography on a desalting column (Bio Gel P-6DG, 1 × 3 cm) equilibrated with distilled water. Bovine serum albumin was added to the labeled pigeon ovomucoid to a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the preparation was stored at -80°C and used within 2 weeks. Adhesin activity was identified from whole bacterial cells and electrophoretically separated proteins by dot and blot binding, respectively, of radiolabeled pigeon ovomucoid. In dot assays, 1-μl dots of bacterial suspensions diluted 1:1, 1:10, and 1:50 in phosphate buffer A were pipetted onto a gridded nitrocellulose paper. For blot binding analyses, the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar) was used without sodium dodecyl sulfate in order to retain the pigeon ovomucoid binding activity of the adhesin. Proteins from the bacterial sonicates were separated in a 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II device. The bacterial extracts in a volume of 75 μl were mixed with 23 μl of sample solution containing 0.65 M sucrose and 4 mM EDTA in 87 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 μl of 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 20 μl of the mixtures were layered into the sample wells. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a PVDF-P membrane (60 mA, 30 min) (17Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5914) Google Scholar) by using 10 mM CAPS ( 1The abbreviation used is: CAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid.) buffer (pH 11):methanol (9:1, v/v). 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid. Nonspecific binding sites were saturated by incubation of the membranes for 1.5 h in phosphate buffer C (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, 0.5% Tween 20, 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.3). The membranes were incubated with the 125I-pigeon ovomucoid (6 × 105 cpm/15 cm2, specific activity about 2.5 × 105 cpm/μg) in phosphate buffer C for 1 h at +8°C. The membranes were washed three times for 10 min in phosphate buffer C, dried between filter papers, and exposed to an x-ray film with an intensifying screen at -80°C for 5-48 h. Adhesin protein was extracted from the bacteria by sonicating the bacterial suspension with an ultrasonic probe in phosphate buffer A five times for 15 s on ice with a chilling interval of 1-2 min between the sonications. After sonication, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to 2 mM final concentration, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,800 × g for 20 min at 8°C. The sonication supernatant (16 ml) was made 60% with respect to ammonium sulfate saturation by the addition of cold saturated ammonium sulfate (24 ml) in an ice bath. After 1 h, the resulting pellet was removed by centrifugation at 15,800 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was made 70% with respect to ammonium sulfate saturation by the addition of cold saturated ammonium sulfate (13.3 ml). The pellet was collected after 1 h by centrifugation and dissolved in 16 ml of phosphate buffer B (3.3 mM sodium phosphate, 0.05 M NaCl, pH 7.4), dialyzed overnight at +8°C against water, lyophilized, and dissolved in 4 ml of phosphate buffer A. Preparative gel electrophoresis was performed in the absence of SDS in a Bio-Rad 491 Prep Cell device. The heights of the cylindrical stacking and separating polyacrylamide gels (6%) were 2 and 6 cm, respectively. The dialyzed and lyophilized 70% ammonium sulfate pellet (3 ml) was mixed with 920 μl of sample solution (920 μl) and bromphenol blue (80 μl) and pipetted onto the gel which was run at constant current of 40 mA. The elution buffer was 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. Fractions of 4 ml were collected and analyzed by analytical electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels that were stained with Serva Blue G. Fractions containing the adhesin protein were combined, dialyzed overnight at +8°C against phosphate buffer B, lyophilized, and stored at -20°C. For gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS(16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar), the purified adhesin was run in 15% polyacrylamide gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Low Molecular Weight Standards (Pharmacia, Sweden) were run parallel to the adhesin protein. Isoelectric focusing was performed in a Phast Gel electrophoresis device with the Phast isoelectric system (Pharmacia). The Phast Gel 3-9 and the isoelectric focusing standard 3-10 were used. The gel was stained by using Silver IEF-Method 6 of the Phast system(18Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 103-112Crossref Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). For the amino acid analysis, 7 nmol of purified adhesin was dissolved in 100 μl of 6 M HCl. 60 nmol of norleucine was added as an internal standard. The solution was hydrolyzed at 110°C for 24 h, lyophilized, and analyzed with an LKB 4151 Alpha Plus Amino Acid Analyzer according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the adhesin was determined by Applied Biosystems 477A Pulsed Liquid Protein/Peptide Sequencer with 120A Amino Acid Analyzer according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Purified adhesin or sonicates were subjected to electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF-P membranes as described above. The membranes were stained with Serva Blue for 10 min, and, after destaining of the extra stain, the adhesin band was cut off for peptide sequencing. The position of the adhesin was identified by pigeon ovomucoid blotting of adjacent lanes. A suspension of 5 × 108 latex particles in a volume of 100 μl was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 2.5 min and washed twice with phosphate buffer A. The particles were suspended into 90 μl of phosphate buffer A, and 0.4 μg of either purified adhesin or bovine serum albumin was added in a volume of 10 μl and the suspensions were incubated for 2 h at room temperature on a tilting table. The suspensions were centrifuged and washed twice as above. Phosphate buffer A (45 μl) and bovine serum albumin (5 μl, 5 mg/ml) were added, and the mixtures were incubated on a tilting table at room temperature for 1 h. The suspensions were centrifuged and washed twice as above, and the latex pellets were suspended into 50 μl of phosphate buffer A. Latex hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed as described before(14Korhonen T.K. Finne J. Korhonen T.K. Dawes E.A. Mäkel ä P.H. Enterobacterial Surface Antigens: Methods for Molecular Characterization. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1985: 301-313Google Scholar). Adhesin-covered latex particles (5, 10, or 25 μl) were mixed with a 4% suspension of sialidase-treated human erythrocytes (5, 10, or 25 μl, respectively) on a ceramic slide and incubated on ice for 10 min. In agglutination inhibition assays, 10 μl of adhesin-covered latex particles were mixed with 10 μl of the inhibitory compounds on a slide and incubated on ice. After 15 min, 20 μl of sialidase-treated 4% human erythrocytes were added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice. Similar agglutination reactions were obtained in volumes of 5 to 25 μl of latex with 5 to 25 μl of sialidase-treated erythrocytes, respectively. Bovine serum albumin-coated latex particles (0-0.1 mg/1.25 × 108 particles) used as controls gave no hemagglutination reactions. Pigeon ovomucoid contains blood group P1 (Galα1-4Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-) terminals on its glycans(19François-Gerard Ch. Brocteur J. Rev. Fr. Transfus. 1980; 23: 95-102Google Scholar). In hemagglutination inhibition studies, pigeon ovomucoid was shown to be highly active as an inhibitor of the hemagglutination induced by Galα1-4Gal-binding S. suis(10Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Liukkonen J. François-Gerard C. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4311-4317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pigeon ovomucoid was therefore tested as a ligand for the detection of the adhesin activity in S. suis cells in a dot binding assay. Radiolabeled pigeon ovomucoid was found to bind efficiently to S. suis cells with hemagglutination activity, whereas the nonhemagglutinating control strain did not bind pigeon ovomucoid (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the binding correlated with the hemagglutination activity of the strains. Pigeon ovomucoid binding was subsequently used for the detection of the adhesin activity during purification of the adhesin from the bacteria. Several methods used previously for the extraction of adhesins from bacteria were tried for the extraction of the S. suis adhesin. These included heat treatments with or without mechanical homogenization (20Moch T. Hoschützky H. Hacker J. Kröncke K.-D. Jann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3462-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Goldhar J. Perry R. Golecki J.R. Hoschutzky H. Jann B. Jann K. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or extraction with lithium 3,5-diiodosalicylate (22Murray P.A. Levine M.J. Reddy M.S. Tabak L.A. Bergey E.J. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 359-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or alkali(23Stinson M.W. Bergey E.J. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 335-342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These methods were, however, not suitable for the isolation of the S. suis adhesin. Among the methods tried, sonication with high energy was the only successful method for detaching the adhesin from S. suis cells. In fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation of the sonicate (50 mg of protein/16 ml of sonicate), the adhesin activity was precipitated with ammonium sulfate with a saturation degree of 70% (Fig. 2). Ammonium sulfate having a saturation degree of 60% precipitated the contaminating proteins running near the adhesin, as analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of SDS and Western blotting with radiolabeled pigeon ovomucoid. The adhesin was finally purified to homogeneity from the 70% ammonium sulfate precipitate (1 mg of protein/16 ml of sonicate) by preparative gel electrophoresis. Fractions from the preparative gel were collected and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The adhesin was eluted as a single band (Fig. 3). Usually about 150 μg of pure adhesin was isolated from 16 ml of a bacterial suspension of S. suis strain 628 with a hemagglutination titer of 1:32. The purified adhesin appeared in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single homogeneous band of an apparent size of 18 kDa (Fig. 4A). The mobility was not changed by the use of a reducing agent, which suggested the absence of disulfide bridges. This was also confirmed by amino acid analysis which revealed the absence of cysteine residues (Table 1). The amino acid composition indicated that the adhesin is rich in glutamic acid and glycine and also contains high concentrations of alanine and lysine. The adhesin contained somewhat more acidic (21.7%) than basic (16.0%) residues and a relatively high proportion of hybrofobic amino acids (40.3%). The isoelectric point of the purified adhesin was 6.4 (Fig. 4B). The N-terminal amino acid sequence Ala-Ser-Pro-Ala-Glu-Ile-Ala-Ser-Phe-Ser-Pro-Ala-Pro- was revealed by sequencing of the purified adhesin. The sequence had no apparent sequence similarity with other bacterial adhesins or surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria (The NCBI BLAST data base, 8/95).TABLE I Open table in a new tab The P adhesin activity of S. suis was previously shown to occur as two variant activities PN and PO differing in their Galα1-4Gal binding specificity(11Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Nilsson U. Magnusson G. Karlsson K.-A. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27466-27472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N termini of adhesins determined from electrophoretic blots of four other S. suis strains, two of type PN (TEW/2, R75/L1) and two of type PO (752, 825), were identical with the purified adhesin. In order to investigate whether the varying hemagglutination activities of different S. suis strains could be explained by the expression of variable amounts of the adhesin, sonicates of these strains were subjected to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and the presence of the adhesin was probed by blotting with radiolabeled pigeon ovomucoid (Fig. 5). One single band with a mobility corresponding to the purified adhesin was detected in all strains. There was no apparent difference in the band mobilities of PN (strains 628, TEW/2, and R75/L1) and PO (strains 836, 752, 825, and 3031) adhesins. The intensity of the band correlated with the hemagglutination titers of the corresponding strain. Like in many other bacteria(24Nowicki B. Vuopio-Varkila J. Viljanen P. Korhonen T.K. Mäkelä P.H. Microb. Pathog. 1986; 1: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the P hemagglutination of S. suis undergoes spontaneous phase variation. Also in bacteria extracted in the highly agglutinating or low agglutinating phases, the intensity of the adhesin bands correlated with the agglutinating titer (Fig. 5, strain 628). The purified adhesin expressed only weak hemagglutination activity, presumably due to its monovalent nature. In order to make the adhesin polyvalent, it was adsorbed onto latex particles. A strong hemagglutination reaction was achieved with sialidase-erythrocytes on a glass slide (Table 2). As compared to the free adhesin, 0.2 μg of which agglutinated sialidase-treated human erythrocytes on a microtiter plate weakly with a titer of 1:1, 0.2 μg of the adhesin adsorbed to latex particles hemagglutinated the erythrocytes with a titer of 1:16. No agglutination was achieved with latex particles coated with bovine serum albumin. On the other hand, the hemagglutination induced by the adhesin-bound latex particles was inhibited specifically with the same inhibitory compounds, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, and pigeon ovomucoid as hemagglutination induced by whole bacteria(10Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Liukkonen J. François-Gerard C. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4311-4317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Nilsson U. Magnusson G. Karlsson K.-A. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27466-27472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE II Open table in a new tab In previous studies, we found that pigeon ovomucoid, due to the presence of the Galα1-4Gal-containing blood group P1 active glycans, is an effective inhibitor of the P adhesins of S. suis(10Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Liukkonen J. François-Gerard C. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4311-4317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Nilsson U. Magnusson G. Karlsson K.-A. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27466-27472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This glycoprotein was therefore used as an indicator for the presence of the adhesin in S. suis cells by dot binding assay and for the identification of the adhesin protein during its purification. Different lines of observations suggest that the protein isolated was indeed the adhesin responsible for the hemagglutinating activity of the bacteria. The hemagglutination activity correlated with pigeon ovomucoid binding both in whole cells and in the sonication extracts of the cells. In the latter, only one pigeon ovomucoid-binding component was present and corresponded in mobility to the purified protein. Furthermore, the purified protein adsorbed to latex particles induced hemagglutination, which was inhibited by the same inhibitory compounds as agglutination induced by the intact bacteria. Two variant P adhesion specificities are present in Galα1-Gal-binding S. suis, the adhesion activity inhibitable by galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (type PN) or by galactose only (type PO)(11Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Nilsson U. Magnusson G. Karlsson K.-A. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27466-27472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the adhesin was isolated from strain 628 which is of type PN. However, pigeon ovomucoid also bound to whole bacteria and the adhesin band of type PO bacteria. Furthermore, the adhesin bands of PN and PO had similar mobilities in gel electrophoresis, and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were identical. These findings indicate that the two variant P adhesins are closely related. No homology to previously known adhesins was apparent. Recently, a 110-kDa protein of S. suis serotype 2 has been identified as a virulence marker(25Quessy S. Dubreuil J.D. Caya M. Higgins R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1975-1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, the capsular polysaccharides, occurring as at least 29 serotypes, have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of infections caused by S. suis(26Elliott S.D. Clifton-Hadley F. Tai J. J. Hyg. Camb. 1980; 85: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Sandford S.E. Higgins R. Taylor D.J. Diseases of Swine. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1992: 588-590Google Scholar). The contribution of these factors to the pathogenic mechanisms of S. suis are at present not known. Only few adhesins have been identified and isolated from Gram-positive bacteria. Some of these are oral strains and are related to the binding of the bacteria to hydroxyapatite(28LaPolla R.J. Haron J.A. Kelly C.G. Taylor W.R. Bohart C. Hendricks M. Pyati J. Graff R.T. Ma J.K.-C. Lehner T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), saliva(29Ganeshkumar N. Hannam P.M. Kolenbrander P.E. McBride B.C. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or other bacteria (30Andersen R.N. Ganeshkumar N. Kolenbrander P.E. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 981-987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or bind to extracellular components such as fibronectin (31Hanski E. Caparon M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6172-6176Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) or fibrinogen(32Berge A. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9862-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These adhesins differ in molecular properties from the P adhesin of S. suis, and their possible lectin and cell-surface binding activities are in most cases not known or have not been characterized in detail. In Gram-negative bacteria, adhesins from bacteria associated with meningitis include the S-fimbrial adhesin from Escherichia coli(33Parkkinen J. Rogers G.N. Korhonen T. Dahr W. Finne J. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 37-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hacker J. Kestler H. Hoschützky H. Jann K. Lottspeich F. Korhonen T.K. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 544-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an adhesin from Neisseria meningitidis(35Rudel T. Scheuerpflug I. Meyer T.F. Nature. 1995; 373: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an N-acetylglucosamine-specific adhesin of 17 kDa has been reported from type III group B streptococci associated with newborn meningitis (36Bagg J. Poxton I.R. Weir D.M. Ross P.W. J. Med. Microbiol. 1982; 15: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) but further details of the interaction and the molecules involved are missing. The present report represents the first isolation of Galα1-4Gal-binding adhesins from Gram-positive bacteria and from bacteria associated with meningitis. Among Gram-negative bacteria, extraintestinal E. coli strains that cause urinary tract infections frequently produce P-fimbrial adhesins as virulence factors (37Källenius G. Möllby R. Svenson S.B. Winberg J. Lundblad A. Svensson S. Cedergren B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 7: 297-302Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38Väisänen-Rhen V. Elo J. Väisänen E. Siitonen A. Ørskov I. Ørskov F. Svenson S.B. Mäkelä P.H. Korhonen T.K. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 149-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These adhesins interact with glycolipids containing the Galα1-4Gal structure. On the other hand, E. coli isolates associated with newborn meningitis contain S-fimbrial adhesins recognizing Siaα2-3Gal(33Parkkinen J. Rogers G.N. Korhonen T. Dahr W. Finne J. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 37-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Korhonen T.K. Valtonen M.V. Parkkinen J. Väisänen-Rhen V. Finne J. Ørskov F. Orskov I. Svenson S.B. Mäkelä P.H. Infect. Immun. 1985; 48: 486-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Siaα2-3Gal binding has also been described in S. suis, but the adhesion activity differs from that of E. coli in the recognition of the inner sugars in the receptor oligosaccharide(40Liukkonen J. Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Kelm S. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21105-21111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In pigs, many tissues express Galα1-4Gal-containing glycolipids(41Boyd B. Tyrrell G. Maloney M. Gyles C. Brunton J. Lingwood C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1745-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and these are able to serve as binding ligands for S. suis containing P adhesin to frozen sections of pig pharyngeal tissue(10Haataja S. Tikkanen K. Liukkonen J. François-Gerard C. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4311-4317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the in vivo roles of the different adhesion specificities remain so far unresolved. Identification and purification of the P adhesin of S. suis will now make possible the cloning of the corresponding gene and thus facilitate studies designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the binding interaction, the basis of the differential binding of the variant adhesins, and the pathogenic role of the adhesin.

https://openalex.org/W2057777692,"Reverse transcriptases from both human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and 2 are obligatory dimers. A tryptophan-rich repeat motif that is highly conserved between these proteins, as well as in the reverse transcriptase from simian immunodeficiency virus, has been postulated to be involved in hydrophobic subunit interactions. A synthetic 19-mer peptide covering part of this tryptophan repeat motif was recently shown to inhibit human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 reverse transcriptase subunit dimerization (Divita, G., Restle, T., Goody, R. S., Chermann, J.-C., and Baillon, J. G. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 13080-13083). In the present study, we show that the same peptide can also inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 2 reverse transcriptase subunit dimerization, suggesting that the same inhibitors might be used as agents against both viruses as well as against variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 that differ from the variant against which they were developed. Under appropriate experimental conditions, e.g. at acidic pH, this peptide is also able to induce the dissociation of the enzyme from human immunodeficiency virus type 1."

INTRODUCTIONThe ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (or the bc1 complex) is a key component of the energy-conserving electron transfer chains of mitochondria and many respiratory and photosynthetic bacteria. It catalyzes the oxidation of ubiquinol by cytochrome c and the coupled vectorial translocation of protons to generate a transmembrane pH gradient. Although many aspects of the structure and function of this enzyme complex have been elucidated(1Colson A.-M. J. Bioenerg.

The purified complex contains four protein subunits with five redox cofactors: two b-type cytochromes (b562 and b565), one c-type cytochrome (cytochrome c1), one high potential iron-sulfur cluster (the Rieske [2Fe-2S]), and at least one ubiquinone (Q). ( 1The abbreviations used are: QubiquinoneEPRelectron paramagnetic resonanceQoubiquinol-oxidizing centerPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) This bc1 complex is functionally analogous to mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, and the three largest subunits are homologous to their mammalian counterparts (14Hauska G. Nitschke W. Herrmann R.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1988; 20: 211-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The degree of sequence similarity is particularly striking among the cytochrome b polypeptides from a wide range of species (2degli Esposti M. de Vries S. Crimi M. Ghelli A. Patarnello T. Meyer A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 243-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar).The cytochrome b polypeptide contains the two b hemes and participates in the ubiquinol oxidation and ubiquinone reduction reactions of the Q cycle(6Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). He et al.(15He D.-Y. Yu L. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2292-2298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have identified two regions of the bovine cytochrome b subunit that may participate in quinone binding using specific labeling with photoreactive quinone analogs. We have created a number of relatively conservative amino acid replacements in the region of the R. sphaeroides protein that corresponds to the first of these putative quinone-binding regions in the bovine cytochrome b. While screening the chromatophore membranes isolated from photosynthetically grown R. sphaeroides cells expressing the various mutated forms of cytochrome b, we noted that the substitution of a serine for threonine at position 160 resulted in the loss of about two-thirds of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity in the membranes relative to membranes from control cells. Combined with the fact that this threonine residue is one of the most conserved amino acids in the primary structure of cytochrome b, this result may indicate that Thr160 is an important residue involved in the structure and function of the bc1 complex. Here we report the purification and further characterization of the complexes containing conservative substitutions at position 160 of cytochrome b, which affect the activity of the enzyme and the properties of redox centers residing in separate subunits. In general, the results are consistent with current models, placing this region of cytochrome b at or near the quinol-oxidizing center and the intersubunit interface with the iron-sulfur subunit. However, the substitution of serine for threonine 160 also has an effect on cytochrome b562, which is not generally thought to interact directly with the quinol-oxidizing center. Thr160 may also play a role in the proper interaction of subunit IV and cytochrome b.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDodecyl maltoside was purchased from Anatrace.

Wild-type R. sphaeroides NCIB8253 was generously provided by Dr. R. Niederman (Rutgers University).Growth of BacteriaE. coli were grown at 37°C on LB medium. Extra rich media, e.g. TYP(22Titus D.E. Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. 2nd Ed. Promega Corporation, Madison, WI1991: 105Google Scholar), were used in procedures for the rescue of single-stranded DNA or the purification of low copy number plasmids(23Khosravi M. Ryan W. Webster D.A. Stark B.C. Plasmid. 1990; 23: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Plasmid-bearing R. sphaeroides BC17 cells were grown at 30°C on an enriched Sistrom's medium (24Sistrom W.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1960; 22: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) containing 5 mM glutamate and 0.2% casamino acids. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.1 with a solution of 6 M NaOH and 2 M KOH to increase the sodium ion content of the medium to a more optimal level(24Sistrom W.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1960; 22: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Photosynthetic cultures of R. sphaeroides were grown essentially as described(25Feher G. Okamura M.Y. Clayton R.T. Sistrom W.R. The Photosynthetic Bacteria. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1978: 349-386Google Scholar). Cells harboring mutated fbc genes on the pRK415-derived plasmids described below were grown photosynthetically for one or two serial passages only to minimize any pressure for reversion. The inoculation volume used for photosynthetic cultures was always at least 5% of the total volume. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100-125 mg/liter; tetracyline, 10-15 mg/liter for E. coli and 0.75-1.0 mg/liter for R. sphaeroides; kanamycin sulfate, 30-50 mg/liter for E. coli and 20-25 mg/liter for R. sphaeroides; trimethoprim, 85-100 mg/liter for E. coli and 25-30 mg/liter for R. sphaeroides.Construction of Mutation(s)Mutations were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Altered-Sites system from Promega, and oligonucleotides were synthesized at the OSU Recombinant DNA/Protein Core Facility. The successfully employed oligonucleotides were CTGGGGCGCCAGCGTGATCAC for the Thr160 →Ser mutation and CCTTCTGGGGCGCCTACGTGATCACCGGCCT for the Thr160 →Tyr mutation. The template DNA fragment for mutagenesis was obtained from a previously cloned 6.7-kilobase pair BamHI fragment, which was isolated from R. sphaeroides NCIB 8253 ( 2S. Usui and L. Yu, unpublished results.) and contains the fbcFBC operon encoding the three largest subunits of the cytochrome bc1 complex. The 3.5-kilobase pair NcoI-BstXI DNA fragment containing the fbcFBC operon was subcloned from the BamHI clone into pALTER-1 (Promega; previously designated pSELECT-1). In order to facilitate sequence verification and transfer into the expression vector following mutagenesis, the template was modified to reduce the size of the DNA fragment containing the target sites for mutagenesis. For this purpose we introduced a silent mutation creating a PinAI site (at position 579 in the fbcB gene) and eliminated a BstEII site present outside of the coding regions in the cloned R. sphaeroides DNA fragment, so that the target region for mutagenesis is contained in a ∼200-base pair fragment flanked by unique BstEII and PinAI sites (Fig. 1). We also introduced a unique XbaI site between the fbcB and fbcC genes. The nucleotide sequence from just upstream of the BstEII site through the PinAI site was determined and found to be identical to the published sequence of the fbcB gene from R. sphaeroides Ga(21Yun C.-H. Beci R. Crofts A.R. Kaplan S. Gennis R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), except for the single base changed in creating the PinAI site. This engineered fbc operon was subcloned into the expression vector (see below), conjugated into R. sphaeroides BC17 (a strain from which most of the fbcFBC operon has been deleted(21Yun C.-H. Beci R. Crofts A.R. Kaplan S. Gennis R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), and found to support the same rate of photosynthetic growth as the original 3.5-kilobase pair fbc clone.Construction of Vectors for the Expression of Mutated Complexes in R. sphaeroidesThe gene encoding a trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase from R388 (26Ward J.M. Grinstead J. Plasmid. 1982; 7: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (excised from pSup5Tp) and the engineered fbc-containing insert from pSELNB3503 were combined into the multiple cloning site polylinker of pSL1180 by a series of in vitro manipulations. The resulting 4400-base pair fragment containing the dihydrofolate reductase gene and the R. sphaeroides fbc operon were subcloned together into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the broad host range vector pRK415, producing pRKDNB3503 (Fig. 1B). For the purpose of subcloning the 200-base pair BstEII-PinAI fragments from pSELNB3503 following mutagenesis, pRKDNB35KmBP (Fig. 1C) was constructed by inserting the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K between the BstEII and PinAI sites of pRKDNB3503. Using pRKDNB35KmBP to receive the mutated BstEII-PinAI fragments eliminates the possibility of retaining or recloning the wild-type fragment when attempting to subclone the mutated fragments into the expression vector (27Hacker B. Barquera B. Crofts A.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4403-4410Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Loss of kanamycin resistance was then used to screen for recombinant plasmids. pRKDNB3503 derivatives were conjugated into R. sphaeroides BC17 (21Yun C.-H. Beci R. Crofts A.R. Kaplan S. Gennis R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) from E. coli S17-1 (20Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5593) Google Scholar) using a plate mating procedure essentially as described(28Pemberton J.M. Bowen A.R.S.G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 110-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nano F.E. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 1094-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Other Recombinant DNA TechniquesGeneral molecular genetic methods were performed essentially as described in Sambrook et al.(30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA plasmids and restriction fragments were recovered from preparative agarose gels according to Qian and Wilkinson (31Qian L. Wilkinson M. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 736-738PubMed Google Scholar) after staining with methylene blue (this avoids exposure to ultraviolet light). Nucleoside sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems model 373 automatic DNA sequencer. Sequencing of mutagenized DNA templates was conducted by amplification of a DNA segment including the entire BstEII to PinAI sequence using polymerase chain reaction followed by conversion to single-stranded form by treatment with T7 gene 6 exonuclease as described(32Du Z. Hood L. Wilson R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 104-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The presence of engineered mutations and the absence of other changes in the template region was reconfirmed once for each mutant clone following transfer to and expression in R. sphaeroides BC17 by purifying the expression plasmid from an aliquot of a photosynthetic culture and determining the nucleotide sequence as described above.Isolation of Chromatophores and Purification of bc1 ComplexesChromatophores were prepared from frozen cell paste of photosynthetically grown R. sphaeroides BC17 complement and mutant strains by proportionally scaling down the previously described procedure (33Yu L. Yu C.-A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4934-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. To prepare chromatophores for preliminary characterization in situ, the initial clarification step by low speed centrifugation was modified by increasing the speed to 38,000 × g and the duration to 45 min (34Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in order to reduce the light scattering of the chromatophore suspensions.The cytochrome bc1 complexes were purified from chromatophores by a modification of the procedure of McCurley et al.(11McCurley J.P. Miki T. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Dodecyl maltoside was used to solubilize the bc1 complexes and 20% glycerol was included during the solubilization and loading of the first column (after Andrews et al.(12Andrews K.M. Crofts A.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)) to help stabilize mutated bc1 complexes in case they prove to be less stable to the extraction conditions. Chromatophore suspensions were adjusted to about 18 μM cytochrome b by addition of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 0°C) containing 20% glycerol, 1 mM MgSO4, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Dodecyl maltoside (10% solution in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 0°C) containing 20% glycerol and 1 mM MgSO4) was added to the chromatophore suspension to 0.525 mg/nmol cytochrome b, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at 0°C and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The hard precipitates at the bottom of the centrifuge tubes were discarded, and the loose pellets and supernatants were collected. 4 M NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.1 M, and the suspension was stirred for 1 h at 0°C. The mixture was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatants were collected and applied to a DEAE-Biogel A column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 0°C) containing 20% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 5 mM NaN3, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside (TMGD buffer containing 100 mM NaCl). The column was washed with, in sequence, 3.33 volumes of TMGD buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 2 volumes of TMD buffer (TMGD buffer without glycerol) containing 150 mM NaCl, and 2 volumes of TMD buffer containing 200 mM NaCl. The crude cytochrome bc1 complex was eluted from the column with TMD buffer containing 300 mM NaCl. The collected bc1 complex was diluted with one-half volume of TMD containing 40% glycerol and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated with TMD buffer containing 100 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 2 column volumes each of TMD buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 200 mM NaCl, and 250 mM NaCl. The nearly pure cytochrome bc1 complex was eluted with TMD buffer containing 375 mM NaCl and concentrated using a Centriprep-10 concentrator to a final concentration of 100 μM cytochrome b or greater. Glycerol was added to about 20%, and the purified complex was stored at -80°C. The purity of the bc1 preparations estimated by SDS-PAGE was 90-95%.Biochemical and Spectroscopic MethodsUbiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity was measured at 23°C by following the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm in a Shimadzu UV2101PC spectrophotometer. A millimolar extinction coefficient of 18.5 was used in calculating the reduced cytochrome c concentration. The nonenzymatic reduction of cytochrome c by ubiquinol was determined under the same conditions in the absence of enzyme. Chromatophore preparations were diluted to a concentration of 1.25-7.5 μM cytochrome b, depending on the expected specific activity of the sample, with a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 0°C), 1 mM MgCl2; bc1 preparations were diluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 0°C), 250 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.005% dodecyl maltoside. Chromatophores and bc1 preparations were assayed by addition of 2-5 μl of suitably diluted samples to a 1.0-ml assay mixture containing 100 mM sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 0.3 mM EDTA, 50 μM cytochrome c, and 10 μM 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinol; 30 μM potassium cyanide was added to assays of chromatophores to inhibit oxidase activity. Protein was determined by the Lowry method (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the inclusion of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in the samples and standards. For accurate measurement of the protein content of chromatophores, interfering pigments were removed by acetone/methanol extraction as described(36Cohen-Bazire G. Sistrom W.R. Stanier R.Y. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1957; 49: 25-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b(37Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1973; 75: 312-323Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar) were determined according to published methods.SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) and to Schägger and von Jagow (43Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean dual slab vertical cell. Disaggregation of the sample and resolution was best obtained using a freshly prepared solubilization buffer containing 5% SDS, 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol, followed by separation on a 16.5% polyacrylamide gel as described(43Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 1-2 h at 30-37°C immediately prior to loading onto the gel. Chromatophores were extracted with acetone/methanol (36Cohen-Bazire G. Sistrom W.R. Stanier R.Y. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1957; 49: 25-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar) before solubilization. Western blotting was carried out as described (44Twobin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar) using rabbit antibody raised against purified subunit IV (33Yu L. Yu C.-A.

Chem. 1986; 261: 14593-14599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polypeptides separated in the SDS-PAGE gel were transferred to a 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase or protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as the second antibody.Low temperature EPR spectra were obtained with a Bruker ER 200D spectrometer equipped with an Air Products flow cryostat. Some spectra were recorded at 77°K using a liquid N2 Dewar. Instrument setting details are provided in the legends of the relevant figures.RESULTSExpression and Purification of Cytochrome bc1Complexes Containing Altered Cytochrome bExpression of cytochrome b with the conservative substitution Thr160 → Ser (T160S) as part of an fbc operon contained on a low copy number plasmid in R. sphaeroides BC17 yields cells capable of photosynthetic growth at a retarded rate (maximal doubling rate about 50-60% of that obtained with the complement strain). The properties of chromatophore membranes isolated from these cells are summarized in Table 1 together with the properties of membranes from complement cells expressing the wild-type cytochrome b also encoded by a plasmid-borne gene. The specific ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity of membranes from the mutant cells is significantly reduced (25-40% of the activity found in complement membranes). On the other hand, these membranes also contain an apparently elevated level of the complex, as indicated by the elevated level of cytochrome b, relative to that found in membranes prepared from complement cells (membranes from complement cells already possess two to three times the amount of cytochrome b found in wild-type R. sphaeroides, presumably due to a gene dosage effect; data not shown, but see (21Yun C.-H. Beci R. Crofts A.R. Kaplan S. Gennis R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). This enhanced level of cytochrome b was found in the membranes of each of three independently isolated mutants containing the T160S alteration.TABLE I Open table in a new tab The mutation Thr 160 → Tyr (T160Y) was also subsequently prepared. R. sphaeroides cells expressing this variant of cytochrome b are also able to grow photosynthetically at a reduced rate. The cytochrome b content of membranes from these cells is also elevated relative to membranes from complement cells (Table 1) but to a slightly lesser extent than membranes containing the T160S complex. The specific ubiquinol-cytochrome reductase activity of these membranes was even lower than that of membranes containing the T160S complex, only 10-20% of that found in complement membranes.The bc1 complexes were extracted with dodecyl maltoside and purified by a modification of described methods (see “Experimental Procedures”) from chromatophore membranes of Rs BC17 cells expressing the Thr160 →Ser or Tyr mutations and from membranes of BC17 expressing the cloned wild-type complex (complement cells). The T160S complex is spectrally identical to the complement complex (Fig. 2) but retains the lower activity seen in the chromatophores. The absorbance spectrum of T160Y bc1 is also similar to that of the complement bc1, but the ratio of b to c1 is lower for T160Y. The biochemical properties of the purified enzymes are summarized in Table 2. SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) shows that the T160S and T160Y complexes contain the same four subunits as the wild-type and complement enzymes, but the T160S complex has a reduced level of subunit IV (estimated by densitometry to be about one half the level present in the complement bc1 complex). Indeed, addition of purified, recombinant subunit IV to the enzyme caused a 70% increase in the activity of the T160S bc1 complex (Fig. 4). Addition of subunit IV to the complement bc1 complex also produced some stimulation of the activity. By comparison, addition of exogenous subunit IV to purified three-subunit complex (completely lacking subunit IV(46Chen Y.-R. Usui S. Yu C.-A. Yu L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10207-10214Cross"

P., Wang, E., Kang, J., and Holland, M. J.(1989) Mol. Cell. Biol. 9, 1243-1254). We now report identification and analysis of transcriptional activities mediated by three cis-acting sites within a 90-bp portion of the rDNA enhancer designated the modulator region. In vivo, these sequences mediated termination of transcription by RNA polymerase I and potentiated the activity of the rDNA enhancer element. Two trans-acting factors, REB1 and REB2, bind independently to sites within the modulator region (Morrow, B. E., Johnson, S. P., and Warner, J. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9061-9068). We show that REB2 is identical to the ABF1 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of REB1 and ABF1 binding sites demonstrated uncoupling of RNA polymerase I-dependent termination from transcriptional activation in vivo. We conclude that REB1 and ABF1 are required for RNA polymerase I-dependent termination and enhancer function, respectively. Since REB1 and ABF1 proteins also regulate expression of class II genes and other nuclear functions, our results suggest further similarities between RNA polymerase I and II regulatory mechanisms. Two rDNA enhancers flanking a rDNA minigene stimulated RNA polymerase I transcription in a “multiplicative” fashion.

Several lines of evidence show that these latter enhancer elements are binding sites for basal transcription factors that interact with the gene promoter(11Reeder R.H. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Sollner-Webb B. Mougey E.B. Trends Biochem.

In yeast, initiation of rRNA synthesis from a 35S-rRNA gene promoter is activated about 20-fold by a 190-bp1 rDNA enhancer element which lies within the spacer region immediately downstream from the 25 S rRNA coding sequences of an upstream cistron and approximately 2.2 kilobase pairs upstream from the gene promoter of a downstream cistron(18Elion E.A. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The sequences essential for yeast rDNA enhancer activity overlap the 22-bp spacer promoter, previously shown to be sufficient to support RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription initiation in vitro(19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Swanson M.E. Yip M. Holland M.J. J. Biol.

Thus, as has been shown for enhancer elements in X. laevis, it is likely that the yeast rDNA enhancer element requires sequences that bind basal transcription factors. Interestingly, additional sequences upstream of the spacer promoter potentiate the activity of the yeast rDNA enhancer element. Although these upstream sequences by themselves do not activate RNA polymerase I transcription, maximal rDNA enhancer activity requires this modulator region in addition to the spacer promoter region(19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, sequences near the 5′ boundary of the enhancer element mediate RNA polymerase I-dependent termination of transcription(19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the 190-bp yeast rDNA enhancer element is a complex element that mediates both enhancement of rRNA synthesis and transcription termination. In this report, identification and characterization of the cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors that modulate rDNA enhancer activity, as well as RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription termination, are presented. Oligonucleotides were provided by the DNA Synthesis Group, Cetus Corp., Emeryville, CA; Dr. J. Bruenn, State University of New York; Dr. P. Luciw and the Protein Structure Laboratory, University of California, Davis. The sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study are presented in Table 1.

Monoclonal antibody (6C11G4) directed against ABF1 (23Rhode P. Seder K. Oegema K. Campbell J. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1926-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Judith Campbell, California Institute of Technology.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain S173-6B (aleu2-3 leu2-112 his3-1 trp1-289 ura3-52), provided by Dr. F. Sherman, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, was used for all of the in vivo analyses described here. Protein extracts were prepared from S. cerevisiae strain S173-6B-pep4, which is identical to strain S173-6B except that it carries a null mutation in the PEP4 structural gene with insertion of a functional HIS3 gene. Yeast strains were grown at 30°C in YP medium supplemented with 2% glucose. Yeast were transformed by the alkali cation procedure with the addition of denatured salmon sperm DNA(24Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were grown at 30°C in a minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco Laboratories), 2% glucose, and 1% casamino acids supplemented with 20 μg/ml each of leucine and histidine, as well as 40 μg/ml tryptophan. Transformants were selected by their ability to grow in the absence of uracil in the growth medium and screened for mitochondrial function. The construction of the low copy number CEN plasmid prib1 containing a yeast rDNA minigene was described previously(19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The prib1 rDNA minigene contains an rDNA enhancer element fused to the 35S-rRNA gene promoter, heterologous pBR322 reporter sequences, and the 35S-rRNA 3′ terminal processing site (Fig. 1B). Plasmid prib2 was derived from prib1 by replacement of the 35S-rRNA 3′ terminal processing site with a second copy of the rDNA enhancer element, designated the test enhancer (Fig. 1B). Plasmid prib2 was constructed as follows. Plasmid prib1 +29/+131 (19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI to remove the fragment containing the 35S-rRNA 3′ terminal processing site, repaired with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and religated with insertion of a PvuII linker (Collaborative Research). The unique EcoRI and SalI sites flanking the enhancer element upstream from the 35S-rRNA gene promoter were then destroyed by repair with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and mung bean nuclease, respectively, to generate plasmid pribPvuII. A functionally wild-type enhancer element was derived from plasmid prib1 +29/+131, which contains rDNA enhancer element sequences extending from an EcoRI site at position -161 to a SalI linker site at position +29 relative to the HindIII site (position +1) in the enhancer element (19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI and SalI, followed by repair with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The wild-type enhancer element fragment was blunt-end ligated into the test enhancer site at the unique PvuII site in plasmid pribPvuII. Unique EcoRI and SalI sites flanking the test enhancer were regenerated as a consequence of ligation in plasmids prib2 wild-type (WT) and prib2 wild-type reverse orientation (WT reverse). Derivatives of prib2 containing deletion mutations within the test enhancer element were generated by EcoRI/SalI enhancer fragment swaps between the test enhancer in prib2 WT and prib2 WT reverse and mutant enhancer elements previously isolated in prib1 (19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Test enhancer elements carrying base substitution mutations were prepared by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) as described below and used to replace the test enhancer in prib2. The rDNA minigene in plasmid prib3 was constructed by ligating an EcoRI fragment corresponding to the 35S-rRNA 3′ terminal processing site into the unique EcoRI site in plasmid prib2. Base substitution mutations were incorporated into the rDNA enhancer element by PCR using prib1 +29/+131 as template and are denoted by lowercase type and the “m” suffix (Fig. 1D). Mutations at Site 1 and Site 3 (Fig. 1D) were generated by PCR using clockwise mutagenic primers (muta1 and muta3, respectively) extending from the EcoRI site at the 5′ border of the enhancer element to sequences downstream from Site 1 or Site 3 and a counterclockwise primer complementary to heterologous pBR322 reporter sequences located downstream from the 35S-rRNA gene promoter (pBR322H3ccw, 24b). For the site2m mutation, the four primer method (25Higguchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar) was used (Ribo21; pBR322RIcw, 23b; pBR322H3ccw, 24b). PCR products were digested with EcoRI and SalI, and the mutant enhancer elements (EcoRI/SalI fragments) were used to replace the test enhancer elements in prib1 and prib2, respectively. In vivo expression of rDNA minigenes was monitored by Northern (RNA) blotting with 32P-labeled, single-stranded RNA probes complementary to pBR322 reporter sequences within the minigene transcripts. High specific activity RNA probes were prepared by SP6 RNA polymerase transcription according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Plasmid pSP-322HB containing the 346-bp HindIII/BamHI fragment from pBR322 was used to generate probe complementary to the reporter sequences within minigene transcripts(19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As an internal control, a second probe complementary to 790 bases of the coding sequences of the yeast GCR1 gene was hybridized simultaneously or in parallel to an identical panel. The template for GCR1 probe was PvuII-digested pSP-GCR1, which contains the 2193-bp EcoRI/SacI fragment from GCR1(26Holland M.J. Yokoi T. Holland J.P. Myambo K. Innis M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) cloned into pSP65 (Promega). Total cellular RNA from several independent yeast transformants carrying each plasmid was isolated, electrophoresed, and transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.) as described previously(19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nytran blots were prehybridized in buffer containing: 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.8 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 × Denhardt's solution, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide (0.1 ml/cm2) at 55°C for 2-5 h. For hybridization, fresh prehybridization solution was added (0.08 ml/cm2, 55°C), which contained 32P-labeled RNA probe (5-10 × 105 cpm/ml). After hybridization at 55°C for 18 h, blots were washed in buffer containing: 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% SDS (four changes at room temperature and three changes at 69°C, 20 min each). Whole cell extracts (S100) were prepared essentially as described previously (27Holland J.P. Brindle P.K. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) except that MgCl2 was omitted from the final dialysis buffer. S. cerevisiae strain S173-6B, pep4, was cultured in YP media containing 2% glucose to early log phase (A660 nm = 1.0-2.0). Cells from 12 liters of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm (5 min) in an HS-4 rotor (Sorvall) at 4°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in cold buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Me2SO, and 20% glycerol) to a final volume of 45 ml. The cell suspension was frozen by dripping into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. To prepare S100 extracts, 25-50 g of frozen cell suspension was broken in an Eaton press. All subsequent procedures are performed at 4°C. Disrupted cells were suspended in an equal volume of extract buffer containing: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 25% sucrose, and 20% glycerol. The suspension was adjusted to 10% of saturation by dropwise addition of saturated ammonium sulfate, stirred for 20 min, and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm in a Beckman Type 70Ti rotor for 3 h. Solid ammonium sulfate (0.4 g/ml) was added to the supernatant with adjustment to pH 7 by dropwise addition of 1 N NaOH and the precipitate collected by centrifugation at 48,000 rpm in a Beckman Type 70Ti rotor for 30 min. The precipitate was resuspended in 5-10 ml of buffer containing: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol. The suspension was dialyzed against two changes (1 liter each) over 12 h of the same buffer without MgCl2. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was quick-frozen by dripping into liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. No loss of DNA binding activity of any of the factors described here was detected in extracts stored up to 6 months. Protein concentration was determined by bichinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) using a bovine serum albumin standard. DNA binding activities in 10 mg of the S100 whole cell extract were fractionated by Mono S HR5/5 FPLC (Pharmacia) cation exchange chromatography as described previously (28Brindle P.K. Holland J.P. Willett C.E. Innis M.A. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4872-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a 50-500 mM KCl linear gradient followed by step elution with 1.0 M and 2.0 M KCl. While Mono S fractions (1 ml) stored at -80°C showed no loss of activity, binding activities were reduced when aliquots were left on ice. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotide probes were generated as follows; 2 pmol of single-stranded oligonucleotide was 5′ end-labeled in a 10 μl reaction containing: 80 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 12 mM MgCl2, 6 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp; >5000 Ci/mmol), and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Labeling reactions were performed at 37°C for 45 min. The reactions were terminated by heating to 68°C for 15 min. An excess (50%) of an unlabeled complementary oligonucleotide was annealed to generate a double-stranded probe, and free [γ-32P]ATP and single-stranded oligonucleotide were removed using a G-25 Quick-Spin columns (Boehringer Mannheim). The specific activity of the probe was determined by scintillation counting of an aliquot adsorbed on DE81 filters. DNA probes corresponding to the modulator region of the rDNA enhancer element (EcoRI/FokI probes) were prepared by 35 rounds of PCR using oligonucleotide primers complementary to pBR322 sequences that flank the rDNA enhancer element (pBR322RIcw, 23b; pBR322H3ccw, 24b) in appropriate prib1 templates. After phenol extraction, the PCR product was precipitated from 1.2 M ammonium acetate, 55% isopropanol. The PCR product was limit-digested with FokI and EcoRI and then treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. To inactivate calf intestinal phosphatase, the reaction was adjusted to 40 mM EDTA and 30 mM EGTA, heated to 85°C for 15 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature. Restriction fragments were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. EcoRI/FokI fragments corresponding to the modulator region of the rDNA enhancer were sliced from the gel, minced, and eluted from gel slices in a siliconized tube containing 0.5 M ammonium acetate, 10 mM EDTA at 37°C for 4 h. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and the gel slices were reextracted with 7.5 M ammonium acetate for 1 h at 55°C. Pooled eluate was adjusted to 0.2 M NaCl, and three volumes of 100% ethanol were added. The DNA was recovered by centrifugation in an SW60 rotor (Beckman) at 40,000 rpm 1 h at 4°C, resuspended, extracted with isoamyl alcohol:CHCl3 (1:24), and reprecipitated in sodium acetate to remove ammonium ion. The recovered DNA fragment (100-200 fmol) was 5′-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in a 6-μl reaction containing 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as above for oligonucleotide probes. Following heat inactivation of polynucleotide kinase, deoxynucleotides (25 μM final) and 3 units of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I were added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated for 20 min at 30°C to generate blunt end fragments. Reactions were then adjusted to 50 mM EDTA and heated to 75°C for 15 min to inactivate the DNA polymerase. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed, and the specific activity of the probe was determined as for oligonucleotide probes. Gel mobility shift assays were performed in 5-μl reactions containing: 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 ng/ml poly(dI-dC), 500 ng/ml M13mp10 single-stranded DNA, and 0.2 fmol of radiolabeled DNA probe (specific activity, 5 × 106 dpm/pmol). The poly(dI-dC)/M13 single-stranded DNA mixture was empirically determined to minimize nonspecific DNA binding and nuclease degradation. Reactions were mixed in prechilled, siliconized tubes or microtiter dishes and initiated by addition of 6 μg of S100 protein or 3 μl of Mono S fraction. Following a 15-min incubation on ice, 15 μl of gel loading buffer (containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 0.02% xylene cyanol, and 6% glycerol) was added to each binding reaction. For gel mobility supershift assays, varying dilutions of a REB1 polyclonal antibody or an ABF1 monoclonal antibody were added after a 15-min binding reaction and incubated on ice for an additional 15 min prior to addition of 15 μl of gel loading buffer. Binding reactions were immediately subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels at 4°C for 2 h at 5 V/cm gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (50 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA). Autoradiography of gels dried onto Whatman DE81 filters was performed using Kodak XAR5 film and a DuPont Lightning Plus intensifying screen at -80°C. The Genetics Computer Group (GCG) package was used for sequence analysis(29Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11534) Google Scholar). The Consensus program was used to calculate a degenerate ABF1 consensus binding site based on high affinity ABF1 sites previously characterized(28Brindle P.K. Holland J.P. Willett C.E. Innis M.A. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4872-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then, the FitConsensus program statistically ranked potential ABF1 sites within the rDNA enhancer. The Find program was used to identify possible binding sites for other yeast transcriptional regulatory proteins described previously(30Verdier J.M. Yeast. 1990; 6: 271-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To better understand how the rDNA enhancer stimulates transcription, we investigated the roles of protein factors which bind cis-acting sequences that modulate rDNA enhancer function, previously determined by deletion analysis(19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Morrow et al.(34Marczynski G.T. Jaehning J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8487-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that there are two DNA binding activities, designated REB1 and REB2, that bind to rDNA enhancer sequences between positions -161 and -93. Ju et al.(32Ju Q.D. Morrow B.E. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5226-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) subsequently cloned the gene encoding REB1. However, the protein(s) responsible for REB2 binding activity had not been conclusively identified. The REB1 and REB2 binding sites in the rDNA enhancer were designated Site 1 and Site 2, respectively (Fig. 1D). Prior deletion mapping analysis suggested that a third site, designated Site 3 (Fig. 1D), located between Site 1 and Site 2 is required for maximum enhancer activity in vivo(19Mestel R. Yip M. Holland J.P. Wang E. Kang J. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To identify protein factors that bind to these sites, gel mobility shift assays were performed with Mono S-fractionated yeast whole cell extracts and DNA probes corresponding to enhancer sequences between the EcoRI site at position -161 and the FokI site at position -93 (Fig. 1D and Fig. 2). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to Sites 1, 2, and 3, designated Ribo1, Ribo2, and Ribo3 (Fig. 1, Table 1) were synthesized and used in parallel gel mobility shift assays. Two previously described double-stranded oligonucleotide probes, HMRB and HMRE, which specifically bind the factors ABF1 and RAP1, respectively, were used to standardize Mono S chromatographic profiles ((28Brindle P.K. Holland J.P. Willett C.E. Innis M.A. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4872-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Fig. 2). REB1 binding activity detected with the Ribo1 oligonucleotide appeared as a major activity peak in fraction 42 (Fig. 2). A similar pattern of REB1 binding was observed using an EcoRI/FokI probe corresponding to wild-type rDNA enhancer sequences extending from position -161 to -93 (wild-type modulator region). An EcoRI/FokI probe containing a triple base substitution mutation within the REB1 consensus binding site, designated site1m (Fig. 1, Table 1), failed to bind REB1 (Fig. 2). To verify that the binding activity that interacts with Site 1 is REB1, gel mobility supershift assays were performed using the EcoRI/FokI probe, Mono S fraction 42, and a polyclonal antibody directed against REB1 (Fig. 3). The gel mobility shift complex was supershifted in the presence of the REB1 antibody, but not by preimmune sera (data not shown; (33Carmen A. Holland M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9790-9797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). These data confirm that REB1 binds to Site 1 sequences. A second DNA binding activity was detected with the wild-type modulator region and the Ribo2 oligonucleotide probe with a major activity peak in fraction 31 (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, this binding activity co-chromatographed with ABF1 protein detected by gel mobility shift assays with the HMRB oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 2). Cleavage of the EcoRI/FokI probe with MnlI at position -120 abolished binding, consistent with the published observations for REB2 (data not shown; (31Morrow B.E. Johnson S.P. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9061-9068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Although these data suggested that the REB2 binding activity corresponds to ABF1, no strong ABF1 consensus binding site was evident at Site 2. Utilizing a degenerate ABF1 consensus binding site (RTCRYKHHDDACG at 75% certainty) developed from strong ABF1 binding sites (28Brindle P.K. Holland J.P. Willett C.E. Innis M.A. Holland M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4872-4885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a table of nucleotide frequencies at all positions within known ABF1 binding sites, putative ABF1 binding sites in the vicinity of Site 2 were statistically ranked. This analysis revealed two poor overlapping matches to the degenerate consensus (o"

One of these, a lysosomal enzyme called proteinase I, contains a cluster of GlcNAc-α-1-P-Ser residues. We call this phosphoglycosylation. To study its function, a cDNA library from vegetative cells was screened, and two novel cysteine proteinase clones were characterized (cprD and cprE). Each of them has highly conserved regions expected for cysteine proteinases, but unlike any other, each has a serine-rich domain containing three distinct motifs, poly-S, SGSQ, and SGSG. cprD and cprE cDNAs were overexpressed in Dictyostelium and the active enzymes identified. cprD codes for a protein of approximately 36 kDa (CP4), which is recognized by monoclonal antibodies against GlcNAc-1-P and fucose. cprE corresponds to a 29-kDa protein, which is recognized by antibodies against GlcNAc-1-P. mRNA for both enzymes is present in the vegetative phase and increases during growth on bacteria but decreases throughout development. When the formation of the fruiting body is complete the mRNA for both messages is detected again but in very low levels.

INTRODUCTIONDictyostelium discoideum is an eukaryotic amoeba that grows as single cells, but when the bacterial food source is removed, the cells initiate a complex multicellular developmental program. Cells aggregate and differentiate into several different types and, in the end, 85% of them are converted into spores setting atop a cellular stalk(1Loomis W.F. The Development of Dictyostelium discoideum. Academic Press, New York1982Google Scholar). We are interested in studying the role of carbohydrate modifications in this organism(2Freeze H.H. Fukuda M. Cell Surface Carbohydrates and Cell Development. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 285-317Google Scholar). One of these is the addition of GlcNAc-1-P to serine residues, which has been well documented to occur on a cysteine proteinase called proteinase I found in vegetative cells (3Gustafson G.L. Thon L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 4Gustafson G.L. Milner L.A. J. Biol.

Although antibodies against GlcNAc-1-P recognize various proteins in the cells and in secretions of cells grown in axenic medium ( 1G. Souza and H. Freeze, unpublished results.) the identity of these proteins is unknown. To study the function of GlcNAc-1-P on a defined protein, we decided to clone members of the cysteine proteinase family expressed in vegetative cells.Previous studies in Dictyostelium identified two developmentally regulated members of this gene family, cprA (CP1) and cprB (CP2)(6Williams J.G.

Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1999-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but none have been identified in vegetative cells. Since cysteine proteinases are highly conserved in all eukaryotes, we used the active site consensus sequence of cysteine proteinases and the cprA and cprB cDNAs to clone two novel vegetative cysteine proteinases, cprD and cprE. They have the predicted conserved regions but also have an unusual serine-rich domain not previously found in any known cysteine proteinase that could be the site of GlcNAc-1-P addition. The cDNA clones were overexpressed and the active enzymes were shown to have GlcNAc-1-P.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRadionucleotides were purchased from DuPont NEN and ICN Biomedicals, Inc. The random primed labeling kit and quick spin Sephadex G-25 and G-50 columns were from Boehringer Mannheim. The messenger RNA isolation kit and the R408 interference-resistant helper phage was from Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA. The Sequenase DNA sequencing kit was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. The monoclonal antibody 83.5 against fucose was a kind gift from Dr. Christopher West (University of Florida College of Medicine). Goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was from Promega.

Geneticin (G418) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction and modifying enzymes were from New England Biochemicals and Boehringer Mannheim. Nitrocellulose filters and prefilters for development were from Millipore. All other chemicals were from Sigma.Cell Culture and Development ConditionsD. discoideum strains AX-4 and AX-2 were grown axenically in HL-5 or with Klebsiella aerogenes(9Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). After 50 h of growth, the bacteria are consumed and the plate appears cleared. This is referred to as the clearing plate stage and corresponds to late vegetative growth. Development of 5 × 107 cells from axenic cultures or from clearing plates was done on 47-mm black nitrocellulose filters resting on prefilters saturated with 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, and took 24 h to complete.cDNA Library Construction and ScreeningPoly(A+) mRNA was isolated from 5 × 108 AX-4 cells from clearing plates. The cells were collected only from plates where no morphological development was visually observed. Since the first few hours of development occur without obvious morphological changes, the library could also have very early development cDNAs represented. Cells were washed twice in cold water treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate, and poly(A+) mRNA was prepared using the messenger RNA isolation kit. A cDNA custom λphage library was prepared by Stratagene in the EcoRI/XhoI site of Uni-ZAP XR vector. For screening, the library was plated on SURE cells, blotted into nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized with the different probes following the conditions advised by the manufacturer. 1 × 106 phage plaques were screened using a 23-base mixed oligonucleotide corresponding to 8 conserved amino acids (IKNQGQCG) of cysteine proteinases as follows: 5′-AT(T/C/A)AA(A/G)AA(T/C)CA(A/G)GG(T/C/A/G)CA(A/G)TG(T/C)GG-3′ and 3′-TA(A/G/T)TT(T/C)TT(A/G)GT(T/C)CC(A/G/T/C)GT(T/C)AC(A/G)CC-5′. The oligonucleotide mixture was radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and purified by centrifugation through columns of Sephadex G-25. Thirty-six of 100 positive clones were reprobed using a 775-bp BglII/SpeI fragment of cprA (from bases 243 to 1018) and a 405-bp HincII fragment of cprB (from bases 338 to 743) as probes(6Williams J.G. North M.J. Mahbubani H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Pears C.J. Mahbubani H.M. Williams J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8853-8866Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These fragments exclude the 5′ end of the cDNAs, which correspond to unconserved regions of the precursor protein. The cDNA fragments were radiolabeled by random primed synthesis with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP and purified by centrifugation through columns of Sephadex G-50. Six positive clones were identified and sequenced. To sequence, the pBluescript plasmid from the phage vector was excised using the R408 interference resistant helper phage, plasmid preparations were performed(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and the double-stranded DNA was sequenced using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit. Three clones corresponded to the same cDNA, and one of them was a full length of 1.1 kb (cprE). The other three clones corresponded to another cDNA, but none had an initiating methionine. Three different probes derived from the largest cDNA of this second group (1.4 kb) were then used to isolate a full-length clone: the 1.4-kb fragment itself, a 373-bp NspI/StuI fragment corresponding to a serine-rich region not found in cprE, and a 206-bp EcoRI fragment corresponding to the 5′ end. 1 × 106 plaques were rescreened and 1% of these were positives. A polymerase chain reaction of phage particles from 200 plaques was then performed (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using as primers the first 18 bases of the 1.4-kb fragment (5′-AGCGAAAACATTTAAA-3′) and the T3 primer (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′). Larger polymerase chain reaction products were rescreened with the 1.4-kb probe and sequenced, and all of them corresponded to a full sized cDNA (cprD).DNA Preparation and Southern BlotD. discoideum DNA minipreparations were performed as described(11Nellen W. Datta S. Reymond C. Silvertsen A. Mann S. Crowley T. Firtel R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 87-100Google Scholar). 50 μg of DNA were digested with restriction enzymes according to the manufacturer's instructions, electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gels, transferred into nitrocellulose filters, and prehybridized for 2 h at 55°C in 5 × Denhardt's solution, 4 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filters were hybridized overnight at 55°C in the presence of 107 cpm of each probe (the complete cDNA of cprA, cprB, cprD, and cprE) and washed 3 times for 20 min with 1 × SSPE, 1% SDS and 3 times for 20 min in 0.1 × SSPE, 1% SDS at room temperature (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filters were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak X-Omat) overnight.Amino Acid Sequence AlignmentsAmino acid sequence alignments were done using the GENEWORKS program (Intelligenetics Inc.). Actinidin tertiary structure was displayed using Xfit Program (12McRee J. J. Mol. Graphics. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar).Subcloning and Transformation ProceduresThe 1.4-kb cDNA of cprD or the 1.1-kb cDNA of cprE was subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI and BamHI/KpnI sites, respectively, of pDNeo67(13da Silva A.M. Klein C. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which allows expression under control of the actin 6 promoter. Cloning and DNA preparations followed standard procedures as described(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Stable transformants overexpressing cprD and cprE were obtained using the calcium procedure of Nellen et al.(11Nellen W. Datta S. Reymond C. Silvertsen A. Mann S. Crowley T. Firtel R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 87-100Google Scholar). 2 × 107 cells of AX-4 (for cprD) or AX-2 (for cprE) were transfected with a calcium phosphate precipitate of 6, 12, or 25 μg of plasmid DNA. After 1 week of selection in 20 μg/ml G418, cells were transferred to flasks and grown under agitation in HL-5 containing 20 μg/ml G418.RNA Isolation and Northern TransferTotal RNA was isolated from 107 cells as described(14Juliani M.H. Souza G.M. Klein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9077-9082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 20 μg of RNA were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The filters were prehybridized overnight at 37°C in 50% formamide, 3 × SSC(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated 5% nonfat dry milk(15Siegel L.I. Bresnick E. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), 60 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.4% SDS and hybridized overnight with 107 cpm of the cprA, cprD, and cprE cDNAs radiolabeled as above. The mRNA levels on each lane were normalized by probing the same filters with 1G7, a constitutively expressed gene(16Early A.E. Williams J.G. Development. 1988; 103: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Analysis and Western BlotTotal cell lysates (40 μg of protein) or 1 μg of purified proteinase I were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels as described(17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The proteins were blotted into nitrocellulose filters (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 490-491Google Scholar) and incubated with monoclonal antibodies against GlcNAc-1-P (monoclonal antibody AD7.5, 1:20 of a culture supernatant) or fucose (monoclonal antibody 83.5, 1:1000 a culture supernatant). The primary antibody was detected with conjugated alkaline phosphatase goat anti-mouse secondary antibody(18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 490-491Google Scholar).Cysteine Proteinase Activity Assay10 μg of protein from total cell lysates was incubated in the presence of 0.3 mMH-D-Val-Leu-Lys-p-NA or N-Cbz-Lys-ON-p in 0.1 M phosphate/citrate, pH 5.0, 1 mM DTT for 20 min in a 96-well dish, and color development was detected at 405 nM using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. For inhibition studies, protein samples were preincubated for 30 min with 10 μM specific cysteine proteinase inhibitor E-64 prior to the addition of the substrates. Cysteine proteinase activity assay in 10% polyacrylamide gels was done with 40 μg of total cell lysate obtained by freeze-thaw of cells in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT without boiling. After electrophoresis, the gel was incubated in 0.1 M phosphate/citrate, pH 5.0, 20 mM cysteine buffer with or without 10 μM E-64 for 20 min, and then in the same buffer containing 20 μMN-t-Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-7-MCA. The gel was observed in a UV transilluminator and photographed using a Polaroid system with a Kodak yellow A filter.α-D-Mannosidase and β-D-Glucosidase Activity Assays10 μg of total cell lysates were assayed in phosphate/citrate buffer (0.05 M in respect to sodium phosphate) using 4-methylumbelliferyl substrates at concentrations of 0.003 M (pH 4.4) for α-D-mannosidase and 0.006 M (pH 4.1) for β-D-glucosidase as described(19Freeze H.H.

A cDNA library was probed with a 23-base mixed oligonucleotide based on the active site consensus sequence of cysteine proteinases. Positive clones were then rescreened with cDNA fragments of Dictyostelium cprA and cprB as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the full-length clones for two novel cDNAs, cprD (1.4 kb) and cprE (1.1 kb) were identified and analyzed as follows.Analysis of the cDNAs for cprD and cprEThe nucleotide sequence of cprD and cprE is depicted in Fig. 1, and from here the enzymes are referred to as cysteine proteinase 4 (CP4) and cysteine proteinase 5 (CP5), respectively. Sequence alignment of CP4 and CP5 (Fig. 2) with human cathepsins (B, H, L, and S)(20Ritonja A. Popovic T. Turk V. Wiedenmann K. Machleidt W.

Chem. 1970; 245: 3485-3492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and two cysteine proteinases from Dictyostelium (CP1 and CP2) show that CP4 and CP5 have all the expected conserved regions and critical active site residues. The first 17 amino acids of both enzymes probably constitute a signal peptide (pre-region) since it is consistent with other typical signal sequences(26Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Both CP4 and CP5 also contain the pro-region (amino acids 18-111) in the N-terminal domain, which is not found in the mature form of known cysteine proteinases. Two potential N-linked glycosylation sites are found in both CP4 and CP5.Figure 2:Sequence alignment of CP4 and CP5 to human, plant, and Dictyostelium cysteine proteinases. Shared sequences are boxed. Double underlines indicate putative N-glycosylation sites, and arrows show the active site cysteine and histidine. * indicates the beginning of the mature protein. In boldface are the serine-rich domains on CP4 and CP5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An unusual feature of these deduced amino acid sequences is the presence of a serine-rich domain near the C terminus of both proteins. In CP4 it is 115 amino acids long and contains 60 serine residues (52%), while in CP5 the same region contains 12 serine residues out of 24 amino acids (50%). Another Dictyostelium cysteine proteinase, CP2, also has an insert in this region (42 amino acids long), but its serine content is only 11%. Other cysteine proteinases typically have much shorter sequences (1-12 amino acids) in this region (Fig. 2). In CP4, the serine residues seem to be distributed in three distinct repeated motifs: poly-S, SGSQ, and SGSG. Serines in the insert from CP5 seem to follow the same pattern but in fewer repeats.The tertiary structures of cysteine proteinases actinidin, papain, and the human liver cathepsin B are known(27Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 141: 441-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 28Kamphuis I.G. Kalk K.H. Swart M.B. Drenth J. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The similarity in the conserved regions of CP4 and CP5 to these cysteine proteinases suggests that they may have the same overall structure. Fig. 3 shows the tertiary structure of actinidin and the location of the serine-rich insert of CP4 and CP5 based on the inferred amino acid sequence homology and crystal structures. The insertion occurs at Gly-170 (actinidin), and in CP4 it comprises nearly one-third of the predicted size of the mature protein. As seen in Fig. 3, the insert lies on the opposite side of the protein away from the active site.Figure 3:Location of the serine-rich inserts in relation to the active site of a cysteine proteinase. The relative size and location of the serine-rich insertions of CP4 (A) and CP5 (B) are depicted onto the α-carbon structure of actinidin. The active sites Cys-25 and His-162 are indicated. The insertion occurs at Gly-170 of the actinidin sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Southern Blot Analysis of cprD and cprESouthern blots of Dictyostelium DNA samples digested with different enzymes were probed with the cprA, cprB, cprD, and cprE cDNAs and washed at high stringency (Fig. 4). The results confirm that the cDNA clones described here are different from cprA and cprB and that they are from Dictyostelium and not from their bacterial food source. Some cross-reactivity occurs because there are common sequences among cprA, cprB, cprD, and cprE. This is shown by the alignment of faint bands of cprA and cprB when blots are probed with cprD and cprE. A clear example of this is the dark 5.3-kb band in the EcoRI/HindIII digestion of the blot probed with cprB. The blots probed with the other cDNAs show faint 5.3-kb bands.Figure 4:Southern blots of cprA, cprB, cprD, and cprE. Genomic DNA digested with BamHI, BglII, ClaI, and EcoRI/HindIII was electrophoresed in agarose gels and blotted into nylon. The blot was probed at high stringency (55°C) to the entire cDNAs of cprD and cprE. The same filters were reprobed with cprA and cprB. The molecular weight markers are indicated in kb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of cprD and cprE mRNA Levels during Growth and DevelopmentExpression of the mRNA corresponding to cprD and cprE was analyzed in cells grown in axenic cultures (HL-5) or with bacteria (Ka). AX-2 cells exponentially growing in HL-5 were plated on SM agar plates along with bacteria and collected after 44, 47, and 50 h of growth. These times correspond to log growth, beginning of clearing, and total clearing plates, respectively. Cells were then collected at 50 h and plated for synchronous development to analyze mRNA expression (Fig. 5A). Alternatively, cells were plated on the filters directly from axenic cultures (Fig. 5C). As seen, mRNA levels corresponding to cprD and cprE increase during growth on bacteria up to clearing plates and decrease once development starts. Densitometer scanning of the autoradiograms show that the mRNA levels increase from 2- to 4-fold between 44 and 50 h of growth in bacteria. Cells prepared from axenic culture also display a decrease in mRNA expression during development. As seen in Fig. 5C, the mRNAs are not detected after 4 h of development until the formation of the fruiting body is complete, when very low levels of mRNA for both messages are again detected. The same pattern of expression is observed when mRNAs from AX-4 strain are analyzed (not shown).Figure 5:Analysis of the mRNA levels corresponding to cprD and cprE during growth and development. A, cells were plated on SM agar plates with K. aerogenes, and 107 cells were collected after 44 h (growing cells), 47 h (beginning of clearing), or 50 h (clearing plates). Cells were then washed free of bacteria with 20 mM phosphate, pH 6.4, and plated for development on nitrocellulose filters. Samples of 107 cells were taken after 0, 2, 4, and 8 h of development. B, 107 cells were taken from AX-4, AX-2, CP4-25, CP4-6, and CP5-12 axenic cultures. C, exponentially growing cells from axenic (HL-5) cultures were washed with 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, and plated for development over nitrocellulose filters. Samples of 107 cells were taken after 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h of development. Total RNA was isolated, and 20 μg was submitted to electrophoresis in agarose-formaldehyde gels. The gels were blotted into nylon membranes and hybridized against radioactive probes corresponding to cprD, cprE and cprA (as an internal control of development) or 1G7 (a constitutively expressed gene) as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overexpression of cprD and cprE in D. discoideumWe decided to overexpress cprD and cprE in Dictyostelium to investigate whether it codes for active cysteine proteinases modified by GlcNAc-1-P. The cDNAs were subcloned into pDNeo67(13da Silva A.M. Klein C. Dev. Biol. 1990; 140: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), an expression vector that contains the G418 resistance marker and where the cDNA is under the control of the Dictyostelium actin 6 promoter. Transformants were isolated and analyzed for mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 5B, transformed clones (CP4-6, CP4-25, and CP5-12) overexpress the mRNAs 5-10-fold, compared with control cells. Cells transfected with the pDNeo67 plasmid alone show the same pattern as non-transfected control cells.Identification of the Overexpressed Proteins in the Transformed CellsCell lysates from control cells grown in HL-5 or on bacteria and from clones overexpressing cprD (CP4-25 and CP4-6) or cprE (CP5-12) were analyzed by Western blots using monoclonal antibodies against GlcNAc-1-P or fucose (30West C.M. Erdos G.W. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 72: 121-140PubMed Google Scholar) and detected by a secondary antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. As seen in Fig. 6, a protein band of approximately 36 kDa is enriched in the transformed cells (CP4-25 and CP4-6) as detected with antibodies against GlcNAc-1-P and fucose. A very faint 36-kDa band can also be seen in the control cells and in a preparation of a 38-kDa cysteine proteinase purified from cells grown on bacteria that is known to carry GlcNAc-1-P. It appears that CP4 in control cells is expressed in low amounts relative to the 38-kDa protein, which co-migrates with proteinase I(3Gustafson G.L. Thon L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 86: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 4Gustafson G.L. Milner L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7208-7210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gustafson G.L.

In cells overexpressing cprE (CP5-12) a 29-kDa band is increased as detected by the antibody against GlcNAc-1-P, but no increase was found with the antibody against fucose (not shown).Figure 6:Glycosylation pattern of cells that overexpress CP4 and CP5. 40 μg of protein from total cell lysates of control cells grown in HL-5 or Klebsiella (Ka) and transformants (CP4-25, CP4-6, and CP5-12) grown in HL-5 and 1 μg of purified proteinase I were submitted to SDS-PAGE. The proteins of the gel were then blotted into nitrocellulose filters and immunologically detected using a monoclonal antibody (ab) against GlcNAc-1-P (AD7.5) or against fucose (83.5). The primary antibody binding was detected using a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cysteine Proteinase Activity Assays on Transformed CellsTo investigate if cells overexpressing CP4 and CP5 had an increased cysteine proteinase activity, total cell lysates of control or transformed cells grown in HL-5 were assayed for activity as described under “Experimental Procedures” using N-Cbz-L-Lys-ON-p or H-D-Val-Leu-Lys-p-NA as substrates. As seen in Fig. 7, cells that overexpress CP4 and CP5 have 2.5-3.6 times more cysteine proteinase activity with the substrate H-D-Val-Leu-Lys-p-NA and 50% more activity with the substrate N-Cbz-L-Lys-ON-p. In the presence of E-64, a specific cysteine proteinase inhibitor, activity is reduced to 20% of control. As a control, activity levels of two lysosomal enzymes, α-D-mannosidase and β-D-glucosidase, were analyzed using 4-methylumbelliferyl substrates, and no difference in activity was detected in the transformed cells when compared with control cells (not shown). To verify that the increase in cysteine proteinase activity was due to the overexpressed 36- and 29-kDa proteins, we perf"
https://openalex.org/W2033850637,"Activin is a polypeptide growth factor which exerts endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine effects in a variety of tissues. In the pituitary somatotrope, activin represses proliferation and growth hormone (GH) biosynthesis and secretion. We previously demonstrated that decreases in GH biosynthesis in MtTW15 somatotrope cells are due at least in part to decreased binding of the tissue-specific transcription factor, Pit-1, to the GH promoter, resulting in decreased transcription of the GH gene. The objective of the current study was to determine the extent to which activin-mediated decreases in GH transcription were the result of decreased Pit-1 activity and/or decreased Pit-1 protein content in MtTW15 cells. Activin caused rapid increases in Pit-1 phosphorylation, which were temporally correlated with decreases in GH DNA binding. Pit-1 phosphorylation preceded marked decreases in steady-state levels of Pit-1 protein. The rate of Pit-1 synthesis was only moderately decreased by activin, with a time-course similar to that observed for decreases in GH biosynthesis. However, Pit-1 stability was markedly decreased after more than 4 h of activin treatment. These data demonstrate that activin decreases GH expression in MtTW15 cells through multilevel regulation of Pit-1, which may represent a more general mechanism whereby activin and other transforming growth factor β family members modulate gene expression through regulation of transcription factor activity as well as content.

These data demonstrate that activin decreases GH expression in MtTW15 cells through multilevel regulation of Pit-1, which may represent a more general mechanism whereby activin and other transforming growth factor β family members modulate gene expression through regulation of transcription factor activity as well as content."

The c-Myc protein is a transcriptional activator with a carboxyl-terminal basic region/helix-loop-helix (HLH)/leucine zipper (LZ) domain. It forms heterodimers with the HLH/LZ protein Max and transactivates gene expression after binding DNA E-box elements. We have studied the phenotype of dominant-negative mutants of c-Myc and Max in microinjection experiments. Max mutants with a deleted or mutated basic region inhibited DNA synthesis in serum-stimulated 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts. In contrast, mutants of c-Myc expressing only the basic region/HLH/LZ or HLH/LZ domains rapidly induced apoptosis at low and high serum levels. Co-expression of the HLH/LZ domains of c-Myc and Max failed to do so. We suggest that the c-Myc HLH/LZ domain induces apoptosis by specific interaction with cellular factors different to Max.

Programmed cell death is an intrinsic death program operating to eliminate unwanted cells during normal development. It also has been suggested to kill cells after aquirement of growth factor-independent growth properties due to genetic alterations (Ellis et al., 1991; Evan and Littlewood, 1993). Common morphological features of programmed cell death are blebbing of the cytoplasmic membrane, chromatin condensation, and breaking of the dead cell into apoptotic bodies (Wyllie, 1980, 1987). This kind of cell death, often termed apoptosis, does not elicit an inflammatory response in the tissue and can therefore clearly be distinguished from cell necrosis in which cells die as the result of acute injury (Kerr et al., 1972). The apoptotic program appears to be installed in all animal cells and can operate in the presence of inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis (Ellis et al., 1991). In some cellular systems it is even induced by these inhibitors, indicating that short-lived proteins or RNAs may negatively control the apoptotic machinery. Jacobson et al.(1994) recently proposed a model in which the process leading to apoptosis is divided into three phases: (i) an activation phase in which control systems of apoptosis are activated or derepressed (this phase can be sensitive to inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis), (ii) an effector phase in which the activated control system acts on multiple targets in the cell, and (iii) a degradation phase in which the dying cell is broken down. In the latter two phases, inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis are not effective to block the apoptotic program. The cellular proto-oncogene c-myc has been implicated in the control of proliferation and apoptosis. Expression of c-myc is tightly linked to mitogenic stimuli and is a prerequisite for cell growth (for reviews, see Lüscher and Eisenman(1990) and Marcu et al., 1992). Moreover, post-translational activation of a c-Myc estrogen receptor chimera in resting cells is sufficient to induce entry into the cell cycle (Eilers et al., 1989, 1991). Expression of an exogenous c-myc gene renders hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts unable to exit from the cell cycle upon withdrawal of growth factors or serum. Instead, these cells continue cycling and concomitantly undergo apoptosis (Askew et al., 1991; Evan et al., 1992; Hermeking and Eick, 1994). Expression of c-myc is also required for activation-induced apoptosis of T-cell hybridomas (Shi et al., 1992). These observations suggest a model in which proliferation and cell death are processes that are co-induced by c-Myc and which are subsequently modulated by cytokine action (Evan and Littlewood, 1993; Harrington et al., 1994). The c-Myc protein has features of a transcription factor with a transcriptional activation domain in the amino-terminal region (Kato et al., 1990). The carboxyl-terminal region contains a basic region (BR), ( 1The abbreviations used are: BRbasic regionHLHhelix-loop-helixLZleucine zipperFCSfetal calf serumCMVcytomegalovirusNLSnuclear localization signalBrdUrd5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridinePBSphosphate-buffered saline.) helix-loop-helix (HLH), and leucine zipper (LZ) domain (Murre et al., 1989; Landschulz et al., 1988) in a contiguous array essential for specific DNA binding (BR) and dimerization (HLH/LZ) of c-Myc with the BR/HLH/LZ protein Max (Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991; Blackwood et al., 1992; Kato et al., 1992). c-Myc•Max heterodimers and Max•Max homodimers bind specifically to the E-box motif CACGTG (Blackwell et al., 1990). Homodimers of c-Myc are not found in vivo. Since Max lacks a transcriptional activation domain, c-Myc•Max heterodimers have been suggested to act as transcriptional activator and Max•Max homodimers as repressors (Kretzner et al., 1992; Amati et al., 1992). The biological functions of c-Myc reported so far including cell transformation (Stone et al., 1987, Amati et al., 1993a), transcriptional activation (Kretzner et al., 1992; Amati et al., 1993b), and induction of proliferation and apoptosis in quiescent cells (Evan et al., 1992; Amati et al., 1993b) require dimerization of c-Myc with Max and sequence-specific binding of the heterodimer to DNA. Hopewell and Ziff (1995) recently reported proliferation of the nerve growth factor responsive PC12 cell line in the absence of a functional Max. Whether c-Myc can induce apoptosis in a Max-independent manner in these cells, however, is not yet known. basic region helix-loop-helix leucine zipper fetal calf serum cytomegalovirus nuclear localization signal 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine phosphate-buffered saline. Here we have studied the effect of dominant-negative mutants of c-Myc and Max on proliferation. Max mutants with a mutated or deleted basic region efficiently blocked serum-induced DNA synthesis. Unexpectedly, c-Myc mutants expressing only the BR/HLH/LZ or HLH/LZ domain rapidly induced apoptosis. 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts (Green et al., 1974) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) at 5% CO2 and 37°C. The plasmid pUHD10-1 (Deuschle et al., 1989) containing a cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/promoter was used to express different c-Myc and Max mutants. Upstream of the open reading frame, a T7-promoter and a sequence of a translation start site was inserted (pCMV-T7). A hemagglutinin epitope, which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Field et al., 1988), was added at the carboxyl terminus of the mutant Max proteins, MycHLH, and MycLZ. A poliovirus epitope, which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody C3 (Taylor et al., 1990) was added at the carboxyl terminus of ctMyc and ctMycBR-. All mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction-aided cloning techniques and were subsequently controlled by sequence analysis. Positions in the c-Myc proteins refer to the smaller, 439-amino acid c-Myc protein (64 kDa) (Gazin et al., 1984), in the Max protein to the larger, 159-amino acid-long protein (22 kDa) (Blackwood and Eisenman, 1991). The nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the c-Myc mutants corresponds to the authentic NLS M1 of c-Myc, which maps upstream of the basic region (Dang and Lee, 1988). Synthesis of full-length mutant proteins was confirmed by in vitro transcription/translation experiments. The plasmid expressing the β-galactosidase gene under the control of a CMV enhancer/promoter was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Plasmid DNA was purified from bacterial cultures using a commercial purification kit (Qiagen, Diagen, Düsseldorf, Germany). Mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips (Cellocate, Eppendorf, Hamburg) with a system of coordinates that facilitates the relocalization of microinjected cells. 1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes containing a coverslip and allowed to attach for 24 h. For serum starvation, the semiconfluent monolayers were washed with medium without serum and incubated for 48 h in 4.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with low FCS (0.5%). Plasmid DNA (150 ng/μl) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, was loaded into injection needles pulled from 1.2-mm diameter glass capillaries (Clark Electro Medical Instruments, Reading, UK) using a capillary puller (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Cells were microinjected using a semiautomatic microinjector 5242 (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and an inverse Axiovert-10 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Approximately 30% of microinjected cells did not survive the procedure of microinjection. Cell death immediately after microinjection was probably due to severe damage of the cell membrane. The damaged cells died within 5-10 min after microinjection. This cell death showed no characteristics of apoptosis. 30 min after microinjection, these dead cells were detached from the surface of the coverslip and did not interfere with the subsequent analysis of the apoptotic cells. The rate of cells damaged by microinjection was relatively constant and not reduced when TE or only vector DNA was injected. Microinjected cells were returned to the incubator within 30 min. 5 h after microinjection, cells were stimulated with 10% FCS, and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling solution (Cell-Proliferation Kit, Amersham Corp.) was added to each dish at a concentration of 1 μl/ml. The incubation was continued for further 20 h before the cells were fixed. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were then permeabilized by treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed, and blocked in a solution of PBS containing 10% FCS overnight at 4°C to reduce unspecific staining. Primary and secondary antibodies were appropriately diluted in PBS containing 10% FCS. Cells were incubated 45 min with primary and 30 min with the secondary antibodies at room temperature. Between and after these incubations, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS, each time for 5 min. As primary antibodies, the biotinylated monoclonal mouse antibody 12CA5 (hemagglutinin epitope) (Field et al., 1988), C3 (polio epitope) (Taylor et al., 1990), 9E10 (c-Myc) (Evan et al., 1985), and a monoclonal antibody directed against bacterial β-galactosidase (Boehringer, Mannheim) were used. Anti-IgG goat antibodies conjugated to rhodamine and streptavidine conjugated with aminomethylcoumarin (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used for indirect staining. For detection of incorporated BrdUrd, the cells were treated with 2 M hydrochloric acid for 15 min at 37°C. After washing in PBS, the cells were incubated with a fluoresceine-coupled mouse monoclonal antibody directed against BrdUrd (Boehringer Mannheim) for 30 min at 37°C. After washing, the cells were analyzed using an Axioscop fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). By switching the respective filters, the rate of BrdUrd incorporation in cells expressing the different proteins was determined. Photographs were made with a 456070 camera and MC100-regulatory unit (Zeiss) and Kodachrome 400 films (Eastman Kodak Co.). The CM1 probe (Blackwell et al., 1990) containing a c-Myc•Max binding site (boldface) was obtained by annealing two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-GATCCCCCCACCACGTGGTGCCTGA-3 and 3′-GGGGGTGGTGCAC-CACGGACTCTAG-5′) and was labeled by a fill reaction using Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. The binding reaction (20 μl) with reticulocyte lysate, binding mix (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dA-dT), 4% Ficoll), and 50,000 disintegrations/min of labeled CM1 probe was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were subjected to electrophoretic separation at room temperature on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE buffer (1 × TBE = 89 mM Tris borate; 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) at 250 V for 3 h. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak x-ray films between intensifying screens. For competition experiments a CM1mut oligonucleotide was used where the central nucleotides CG were exchanged by GC. We have used the approach of dominant-negative mutants to interfere with the function of c-Myc in vivo. Two types of mutants were constructed to inhibit the formation of functional c-Myc•Max heterodimers in vivo (Fig. 1). Dominant-negative mutants of Max lacking the BR (MaxBR-) or carrying point mutations in the BR (MaxBRmut) can still dimerize with c-Myc (Reddy et al., 1992; Billaud et al., 1993). Overexpression of the Max mutants under the control of the CMV enhancer/promoter should disrupt c-Myc•Max and other c-Myc- or Max-containing complexes and shift the equilibrium from DNA binding complexes to non-DNA binding complexes. As a consequence, the c-Myc•Max-specific E-box motifs remain unoccupied. A similar mode of action is expected for a dominant-negative c-Myc mutant lacking the transcriptional activation domain and BR (ctMycBR-). Overexpression of ctMycBR- should sequester Max protein, which is then no longer available for dimerization with wild-type c-Myc. A second c-Myc mutant, ctMyc, differs from the previous mutant by having an intact BR. Heterodimers of ctMyc•Max have lost their transactivation potential but should be able to bind specifically to DNA. To ensure nuclear transport of all mutant c-Myc proteins, the NLS M1 of c-Myc (Dang and Lee, 1988), which maps outside of the BR/HLH/LZ region, was cloned 3′ of the LZ. The Max mutants contain their NLS at the authentic position in the carboxyl terminus. All mutant proteins were tagged with epitopes of viral proteins of influenza virus (MaxBR-, MaxBRmut, MycHLH, MycLZ) or polio virus (ctMycBR-, ctMyc) in order to detect them by indirect immunofluorescence staining. For unknown reasons, the polio epitope did not work satisfactorily. Instead, we used the antibody 9E10 (Evan et al., 1985), which recognizes the LZ domain of c-Myc. A survey of all mutants used in this work is shown in Fig. 1. The mutants were expressed after in vitro transcription/translation, and correctly sized proteins were demonstrated (data not shown). The properties of the mutant proteins were examined in gelshift experiments. Two functions were tested: (i) formation of ctMyc•Max dimers and specific binding to an oligonucleotide that contains the E-box recognition motif and (ii) the ability of MaxBR-, MaxBRmut, ctMycBR-, MycHLH, and MycLZ mutants to compete for the formation of ctMyc•Max complexes. Unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate extract (translation reaction without addition of exogenous RNA) already revealed a binding activity (Fig. 2A, lane 2, marked with an asterisk). This shift was competed by oligonucleotides CM1 containing the CACGTG motif (Blackwell et al., 1990) and CM1mut with an inversion of the middle CG of the E-box motif (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that this activity is not specific for the CACGTG-binding motif. Additionally, this complex could not be disrupted or supershifted by the addition of antibodies directed against Max (Fig. 2B, lane 2) and c-Myc (data not shown) and therefore contains no Max•Max homodimers or c-Myc•Max heterodimers. The amount of this endogenous shift activity varied considerably depending on the batch of the reticulocyte lysate. When ctMyc was added to the binding reaction, an additional shift appeared that most likely is produced by a heterodimer of ctMyc and endogenous Max, which is already present in the extract (Fig. 2A, lane 3). This shift can be competed with the oligonucleotide CM1 but not with CM1mut (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5). We observed that the Max protein alone did not produce a specific shift (Fig. 2A, lane 6). This was not unexpected since phosphorylation of Max at an amino-terminal casein kinase II (CKII) site in the reticulocyte lysate inhibits DNA-binding of Max•Max homodimers but not c-Myc•Max heterodimers (Berberich and Cole, 1992). We could confirm this observation by using the mutant MaxCKII-, which has replaced Ser-11 by Ala (Fig. 2A, lanes 7-9). Mixing of ctMyc and Max generated a strong shift that can be explained by synergistic action of both proteins (Fig. 2A, lanes 10-12). The specificity of the observed shifts was also analyzed by using antibodies. The α-Max antibodies reduced and/or supershifted ctMyc•Max complexes (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-4). Antibodies specific for the c-Myc LZ domain or the viral tag of Max only inhibited formation of ctMyc•Max specific shifts (lanes 6 and 7). We next tested whether the presence of the mutant Max and c-Myc proteins in the binding reaction can compete for the formation of the ctMyc•Max shift. Addition of a 2-fold excess of MaxBR-, MaxBRmut, or ctMycBR- protein to the binding reaction resulted in a clear reduction of the ctMyc•Max-specific shift (Fig. 2C, lanes 2, 3, and 6), whereas addition of unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate (data not shown) or MycHLH and MycLZ had no effect (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). In summary, ctMycBR-, MaxBR-, and MaxBRmut were able to disrupt a ctMyc•Max complex in vitro and therefore act in a dominant-negative manner as expected. To test whether dominant-negative mutants of c-Myc and Max could inhibit c-Myc function in vivo, we used a combined microinjection/proliferation assay (Fig. 3a). Mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were serum-starved for 48 h and microinjected with expression plasmids (Graessmann and Graessmann, 1983) coding for MaxBR- and MaxBRmut. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum, and BrdUrd was added to visualize DNA synthesis. The cells were fixed 20 h after serum stimulation and stained with antibodies directed against the viral epitope and BrdUrd. Stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts with serum consistently induced DNA synthesis in about 70% of the uninjected cells. This induction was almost completely blocked in cells expressing MaxBR- (Fig. 3b). A similar but less strong block was observed in cells expressing MaxBRmut. Expression of MaxBR- and MaxBRmut differed in regard to their cellular distribution. MaxBRmut was almost exclusively demonstrable in the nucleus, whereas MaxBR- was also observed in the cytoplasm in a considerable portion of cells. As a control, an expression plasmid coding for β-galactosidase was injected. Expression of β-galactosidase had no significant effect on induction of DNA synthesis (Fig. 3b). A quantification of the proliferation assay is shown in Fig. 3c. Examination of the dominant-negative c-Myc mutants in the proliferation assay turned out to be impossible. 6 h after injection of the expression plasmids, many of the cells expressing ctMyc or ctMycBR- showed morphological changes with characteristic features of apoptosis. These changes included cytoplasmic blebbing, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 4). Nuclei of uninjected nonapoptotic cells exhibit a regular blue chromatin staining. Chromatin staining of nuclei of apoptotic cells is irregular with bright areas (Fig. 4, arrow). 20 h after microinjection, the microinjected fields on the coverslip were almost free of cells, and the few remaining cells staining positive for the c-Myc mutants were detached and stuck loosely at the surface. We performed kinetic experiments to determine the onset of apoptosis in cells expressing ctMyc and ctMycBR-. For this purpose, the injected cells were inspected and photographed in intervals of 2 h after microinjection (Fig. 5). Expression of mutant c-Myc proteins could be detected in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm 2 h after microinjection (data not shown). The rate of expressing cells was >70% of injected cells and thus in the range as observed for other proteins (MaxBR-, MaxBRmut, β-galactosidase). At this time, cells expressing ctMyc and ctMycBR- still showed a normal shape. However, after 4 h, the cells changed their morphology, and bright spots became apparent in the field of injected cells. The number of affected cells consistently increased between 6 to 10 h, while at the same time many of the affected cells disintegrated. After 12 h, cells with a normal shape expressing ctMyc or ctMycBR- were no longer detectable. Apoptosis was not observed in cells expressing β-galactosidase, MaxBRmut (see Fig. 3), and MaxBR- (Fig. 5). Dominant-negative mutants of c-Myc have been successfully used in earlier studies to inhibit transformation (Dang et al., 1989; Sawyers et al., 1992) and induction of DNA-synthesis (Hermeking et al., 1994). These c-Myc mutants carried deletions in the transactivation domain between amino acids 40 and 178 and therefore differ markedly from the mutants employed in this study, which have deleted the amino terminus up to amino acids 354 and 367. Notably, the mutant with the deletion in the transactivation domain did not induce apoptosis in quiescent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts in microinjection experiments (Hermeking et al., 1994; data not shown). Induction of apoptosis by wild-type c-Myc in serum-starved mouse fibroblasts can be inhibited by refeeding the cells with medium containing high serum levels (Evan et al., 1992). Therefore, similar kinetic experiments as carried out with serum-starved 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were performed with proliferating 3T3-L1 cells in the presence of 10% FCS. Since proliferating fibroblasts showed a high mobility on the surface of the coverslip with a permanent change of positions, a similar documentation of the results as shown for quiescent fibroblasts in Fig. 5 was impossible. Despite this problem, plasmids coding for ctMycBR- and ctMyc were microinjected in proliferating cells. Both mutants showed a normal expression rate of 70% after 2 h. Similar to quiescent cells, many of the ctMycBR- and ctMyc expressing cells showed an apoptotic morphology after 6-8 h. 12 h after microinjection, cells with a normal morphology expressing the c-Myc mutants were no longer detectable (data not shown). The mutant ctMycBR induces apoptosis without binding to DNA. However, this mutant can still dimerize with Max. Therefore, we tested whether co-expression of MaxBR- could modulate ctMycBR--induced apoptosis (Fig. 6). Plasmids encoding ctMycBR- or ctMyc were mixed with a plasmid coding for MaxBR- and injected in quiescent 3T3-L1 cells. 12 and 24 h after microinjection, the cells showed a normal morphology, and the rate of ctMycBR--expressing cells was in the range of 50-60% of injected cells. Thus, co-expression of MaxBR- suppressed ctMycBR--induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was also suppressed by MaxBRmut, but less efficiently (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab We next studied whether expression of either the HLH (MycHLH) or the LZ domain (MycLZ) of c-Myc is sufficient to induce apoptosis. Therefore, expression plasmids were constructed encoding either the HLH or LZ domain of c-Myc (Fig. 1). Both mutants separately or in combination could not compete for the formation of the ctMyc•Max complex in gel-shift experiments (Fig. 2c, lanes 4 and 5; data not shown). Despite high expression, each mutant failed to induce apoptosis in quiescent mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts after 12 h (Fig. 7). Cells expressing MycHLH showed an increased rate of vacuolization after 12 h, which might be an indicator of lack of cell health. However, the rate of apoptotic cells was not increased when these cells were examined after 24 h (data not shown). Interestingly, co-expression of MycHLH and MycLZ restored induction of apoptosis with similar kinetics as observed for ctMycBR- (Table 1). A survey of the apoptotic activity of all mutants used in this work is shown in Table 1. Expression of the c-myc gene in serum-starved mouse fibroblasts induces DNA synthesis and at the same time triggers apoptosis. Both events have been shown to require heterodimerization of c-Myc and Max. Here we have studied dominant-negative mutants inhibiting specifically DNA binding of c-Myc•Max heterodimers. The phenotypes of c-Myc and Max mutants after expression in 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts differed markedly. While Max mutants inhibited serum-induced DNA synthesis, c-Myc mutants rapidly induced apoptosis. The mutants MaxBR- and MaxBRmut specifically inhibited binding of ctMyc•Max heterodimers to DNA in gel-shift experiments. Both mutants also inhibited DNA synthesis in serum-stimulated 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts, indicating that they could act as dominant-negative mutants in vivo. This confirms earlier results showing that induction of cell cycle progression depends on binding of the c-Myc•Max heterodimers to DNA (Cogliati et al. 1993; Amati et al., 1993b). Several c-Myc target genes have been identified so far (Eilers et al., 1991; Benvenisty et al., 1992; Bello-Fernandez et al., 1993; Jansen-Dürr et al., 1993; Reisman et al. 1993; Yang et al., 1993; Gaubatz et al., 1994). Modulation of the activity of these and yet unidentified genes by the Max mutants may be responsible for the inhibition of cell cycle progression. Since Max mutants also affect homodimerization of wild-type Max and heterodimerization of Max with Mad and Mxi1 (Ayer et al., 1993; Zervos et al., 1993), the inhibitory effect of Max mutants could be even more complex and rely not only on the inhibition of DNA binding of c-Myc•Max heterodimers. The mutant ctMycBR- inhibited binding of the ctMyc•Max heterodimer to the cognate E-box to a similar extent as the mutants MaxBRmut and MaxBR- did. From this observation, we expected an inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis also for the mutant ctMycBR-. However, this mutant induced apoptosis in serum-stimulated cells before the onset of DNA synthesis could be measured. Apoptosis was induced by this mutant at low and high serum levels and also observed after expression of ctMyc. Induction of apoptosis by wild-type c-Myc requires dimerization of the HLH/LZ domains of c-Myc and Max (Amati et al. 1993b). The following reasons argue against dimerization of Max and the c-Myc mutants as requirement for induction of apoptosis. (i) The presence of Max does not confer DNA binding activity to the ctMycBR-•Max heterodimer. Alternatively, ctMycBR- may act by sequestering Max from other DNA binding complexes. However, Max is also sequestered by MaxBR- and MaxBRmut, which do not induce apoptosis. (ii) Instead, the mutants MaxBR- and MaxBRmut suppress ctMycBR--induced apoptosis, indicating that complexes of ctMycBR-• MaxBR- and ctMycBR-•MaxBRmut are unable to induce apoptosis. We therefore conclude that ctMycBR- and ctMyc interact probably with other factor(s) than Max to induce apoptosis in 3T3-L1 cells. Additional factors interacting with c-Myc have recently been identified including the transcription factors TFII-I (Roy et al., 1993), YY1 (Shrivastava et al., 1993), and AP2 (Gaubatz et al., 1995). The interaction with all three factors has been shown to involve the HLH/LZ domain of c-Myc. Ternary complexes of c-Myc•Max•TFII-I or c-Myc•Max•YY1 could not be demonstrated, indicating that binding of TFII-I or YY1 to c-Myc excludes Max binding. In an attempt to define the carboxyl-terminal domain of c-Myc responsible for inducing of apoptosis more precisely, the HLH and LZ domains were expressed separately. Both domains could be expressed at high levels in 3T3-L1 cells without any sign of apoptosis. However, co-expression of the HLH and LZ domains restored induction of apoptosis, indicating that both domains are important for induction of apoptosis in our system but that the contiguous arrangement of the HLH and LZ domains is not necessary. Additionally, the results indicate that apoptosis is induced by the specific expression of the c-Myc HLH/LZ domain and not by the experimental approach and expression of high levels of proteins. The data suggest that the c-Myc HLH/LZ domain induces apoptosis by its specific interaction with other cellular factors containing HLH and/or LZ motifs. Induction of apoptosis by wild-type c-Myc depends on the presence of the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain (Evan et al., 1992) and dimerization of c-Myc with Max (Amati et al., 1993b). This suggests specific gene-regulatory activity of the c-Myc•Max complex during induction of apoptosis. In this respect, induction of apoptosis by the c-Myc mutants differs markedly from wild-type c-Myc-induced apoptosis. It is very unlikely that the c-Myc mutants can still regulate target genes of wild-type c-Myc. However, since the mutants ctMycBR- and ctMyc probably can still interact with other transcription factors, both mutants may also induce apoptosis by altering gene expression. The changes in gene expression are probably severe and induce apoptosis even in the presence of high serum. Although we are far from understanding how the mutants ctMyc and ctMycBR- act, the presented data are of importance for our understanding of c-Myc protein function. A c-Myc mutant with a deleted transactivation domain (amino acids 40-178) is unable to induce apoptosis in quiescent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts but has been shown to inhibit serum-induced DNA synthesis (Hermeking et al., 1994). This implicates that the central part of the c-Myc protein (amino acids 179-354) either by itself or by binding of other proteins, controls the interaction of cellular proteins with the carboxyl-terminal HLH/LZ domain of c-Myc. Deletion of the central part of the c-Myc protein renders the HLH/LZ domain highly promiscuous for otherwise tightly controlled interactions with cellular factors.

INTRODUCTIONTargeted overexpression of the ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin to mouse pancreatic beta cells results in the generation of an early onset nonimmune hyperglycemic condition(1Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 1067-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This condition is manifested by the first postnatal day and progressively worsens with age(1Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 1067-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Epstein P.N. Ribar T.J. Decker G.L. Yaney G. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1387-1393PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of these transgenic mice revealed that the hyperglycemic condition is the result of a reduced first phase and virtually absent second phase insulin secretory response when glucose is the secretogogue(2Epstein P.N. Ribar T.J. Decker G.L. Yaney G. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1387-1393PubMed Google Scholar). These secretory defects are apparent even when pancreatic insulin reserves are at levels that should be sufficient to prevent the hyperglycemic condition(1Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 1067-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, insulin secretion in young animals can be restored to normal if agents that release Ca2+ from internal stores, such as muscarinic agonists or phorbol esters, are used together with glucose(2Epstein P.N. Ribar T.J. Decker G.L. Yaney G. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1387-1393PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to consider the presence of a Ca2+/CaM( 1The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinK+ATPATP-sensitive K+[Ca2+]icytosolic free Ca2+ concentrationpFpicofaradsnSnanosiemens.) -dependent pathway that might converge with the glucose-dependent stimulus-secretion coupling pathway in the transgenic cells.It is well known that glucose-mediated stimulus-secretion coupling in pancreatic beta cells is the result of a complex intracellular signal transduction pathway that is designed to efficiently release insulin in a biphasic manner(4Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ammala C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 5Misler S. Barnett D.W. Gillis K.D. Pressel D.M. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6McDermott A.M. Sharp G.W. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). During both phases of insulin secretion, the uptake and metabolism of glucose lead to signals that result in closure of a K+ channel located on the membrane that is regulated by ATP(7Misler S. Gee W.M. Gillis K.D. Scharp D.W. Falke L.C. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The closure of these K channels leads to depolarization of the membrane and the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels(8Rajan A.S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Yaney G.C. Hsu W.H. Kunze D.L. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 340-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The ensuing transient rise in [Ca2+]i leads to insulin secretion(9Grodsky G.M. Bennett L.L. Diabetes. 1966; 15: 910-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), but it is not clear exactly how the Ca2+ rise regulates the complex series of steps that culminate in hormone release. Evidence exists that implicates Ca2+-binding proteins as being important primary and secondary mediators of the stimulus-secretion response in beta cells following the rise in [Ca2+]i(10Wollheim C.B. Ullrich S. Meda P. Vallar L. Biosci. Rep. 1987; 7: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Howell S.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 973-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Since the primary response in beta cells to elevated levels of glucose is an increase in [Ca2+]i prior to the release of insulin and our transgenic mice did not respond to glucose, we have investigated the possibility that a defect in Ca2+ signaling is responsible. This was accomplished by systematically examining several key components of the glucose-induced secretion coupling pathway of beta cells. These components included glucose-induced changes in [Ca2+]i as well as beta cell ion channel properties and glucose metabolism. Our results suggest that the overexpression of CaM results in a metabolic defect that is distal to the membrane and apparently involves reduced metabolism of glucose, resulting in the inability to regulate the membrane potential via closure of the K+ATP channels and subsequent opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and Preparation of Islets and Cells6-8-Day old control and CaM animals were taken from a colony of transgenic mice. Islets used for perifusion and [Ca2+]i measurements were isolated by collagenase digestion, immediately placed in fully supplemented RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cultured for 24 h as described previously(2Epstein P.N. Ribar T.J. Decker G.L. Yaney G. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1387-1393PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain single beta cells, 10-20 acutely isolated islets were transferred into 1.5-ml sterile Eppendorf tubes and washed with 1.5 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 137 mM NaCl, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 5.3 mM KCl, 4 mM NaHCO3, and 5.5 mM glucose. The islets were pelleted at 600 rpm for 10 s and resuspended in 100 μl of the same Hanks' balanced salt solution. 100 μl of a 0.05% trypsin, 0.25 mM EDTA solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added, and the islets were mechanically triturated 100 times to disperse cell clumps. Trypsinization was stopped by addition of 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum albumin, 11.1 mM glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Isolated cells were plated into 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) containing a 12-mm round glass coverslip (Fisher) and a ceramic cloning ring to concentrate the cells. Cells were then incubated at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the same components as previously mentioned in a humidified chamber containing 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 24 h.Secretion and Glucose Utilization AssaysGeneral methods for measuring insulin secretion from intact islets have been previously described(2Epstein P.N. Ribar T.J. Decker G.L. Yaney G. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1387-1393PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ribar T.J. Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 106-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin radioimmunoassay measurements were done by the double antibody method as described previously (1Epstein P.N. Overbeek P.A. Means A.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 1067-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) using rat insulin (Linco, St. Louis, MO) as a standard. Tolbutamide came from Sigma. Glucose utilization assays were carried out as previously detailed (12Ashcroft S.J.H. Weerasinghe L.C.C. Bassett J.M. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1972; 126: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) by measuring the formation of 3H2O from D-[5-3H]glucose (Amersham Corp.).Optical Measurements of [Ca2+]i[Ca2+]i was measured fluorometrically using the membrane-permeant Ca2+ indicators (13Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) fura-2/AM (in whole islets) or indo-1/AM (in individual beta cells). Both dyes were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Junction City, OR). Dyes were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and mixed into 1 μM solutions in either fully supplemented RPMI 1640 medium for islets or fully supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for individual beta cells. Ester forms of the dye were loaded into the tissue by incubation at 20-22°C for 1 h and subsequent incubation in dye-free medium for an additional 30 min at 37°C. This loading procedure produced a uniform spatial distribution of dye, suggesting very little compartmentalization within intracellular organelles. Prior to each experiment, the islets or cells were allowed to equilibrate for 45 min at 30-37°C while perifusing with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (133 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, and 5 mM NaHCO3) containing 2.8 mM glucose and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and supplemented with 15 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and pregassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2.Fura-2 measurements were made on a Zeiss standard microscope utilizing the instrumentation described by Neher(14Neher E. Sellin L.C. Libelius R. Thesleff S. Neuromuscular Junction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1989: 65-76Google Scholar). In brief, a spinning wheel was used to alternately excite the dye at 360 and 390 nm, while a photomultiplier was used to measure resulting dye emission at wavelengths >510 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the ratio of the light emitted at the two excitation wavelengths (13Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Neher E. Sellin L.C. Libelius R. Thesleff S. Neuromuscular Junction. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1989: 65-76Google Scholar) using acquisition software written in AxoBasic language by Hui Qiu. Indo-1 fluorescence was measured on a Nikon Optiphot microscope coupled to an Odyssey real-time confocal microscope (Noran Instruments Inc., Middleton, WI). This system used a water-cooled argon ion laser to excite the dye at 350-360 nm, and fluorescence emission was measured at two emission wavelengths (400-450 and 450-500 nm). Images were acquired and analyzed utilizing Image-1 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Philadelphia, PA).Patch Clamp ExperimentsConventional whole-cell patch clamp methods were used to measure the transmembrane currents and to control the ionic composition of the interior of single beta cells. Patch pipettes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) and fire-polished at their tips. The pipette was connected to a patch clamp amplifier (EPC9, HEKA Elektronic, Lambrecht, Germany), and the pipette resistance was typically 3-5 megaohms after filling with intracellular solution. In experiments designed to avoid possible diffusional loss of intracellular constituents, perforated patch recordings (15Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) were obtained by adding into the pipette freshly prepared nystatin (final concentration of 500 μg/ml) that had been dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the pipette was <0.2%. The final access resistance typically ranged from 10 to 30 megaohms, and all recordings were made at 30-37°C.Ca2+ currents were measured in isolation by perifusion of cells with an external solution composed of 130 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 5.4 mM CaCl2, 24 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 2.8 mM glucose and pregassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to maintain a pH of 7.2. The internal pipette solution consisted of 145 mM CsCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 3 mM Na2ATP, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM Cs2EGTA, and O.3 mM GTP and was adjusted to pH 7.35 with CsOH.K+ currents were measured during perifusion with an external solution that contained 133 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 2.4 mM CaCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1.1 mM KH2PO4, 24 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 2.8 mM glucose. For the perforated patch recordings, the perifusion medium contained 16.8 mM glucose in order to measure the closure of the K+ATP channels. The internal pipette solution used for measuring delayed rectifier K+ currents consisted of 140 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM Na2ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM Na2EGTA and was adjusted to pH 7.35 with KOH. For whole-cell K channel currents, the internal pipette solution was modified by decreasing the Na2ATP concentration from 2 to 0.3 mM. The internal pipette solution for perforated patch experiments on the K channel consisted of 140 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, and 500 μg/ml nystatin and was adjusted to pH 7.35.Statistical AnalysisAll values are reported as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were determined utilizing the two-tailed Student's t test. Statistical significance was accepted when p was <0.05.RESULTSTransgenic mice overexpressing CaM in their pancreatic beta cells have a reduced secretory response to glucose at a very early age(2Epstein P.N. Ribar T.J. Decker G.L. Yaney G. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1387-1393PubMed Google Scholar). This reduced secretion is evident when the extracellular Ca2+ concentration is within the normal physiological range (2.5 mM). Neither increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration by 3-fold in the presence of 16.8 mM glucose nor the addition of Ca2+ channel agonists ( 2P. N. Epstein, T. J. Ribar, G. L. Decker, G. C. Yaney, and A. R. Means, unpublished results.) induced secretion in beta cells from CaM mice. Since Ca2+ is necessary for insulin secretion(9Grodsky G.M. Bennett L.L. Diabetes. 1966; 15: 910-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), this suggests that CaM overexpression produces a defect in some aspect of Ca2+ regulation of insulin secretion. We have systematically examined the possible sources of this beta cell defect in isolated islets and single cells from normal and transgenic mice.Defective [Ca2+]i Signaling in Beta Cells from CaM MiceWe began by using the fluorescent calcium indicator dye fura-2 (13Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to measure [Ca2+]i in beta cells within islets taken from normal and transgenic mice. Fig. 1 is a representative tracing that clearly demonstrates that when the extracellular glucose concentration was 2.8 mM, [Ca2+]i was similar in control and CaM islets. The average resting [Ca2+]i levels (Fig. 2A) measured in control islets (n = 8) and in CaM islets (n = 6) were not statistically different from each other (p > 0.10). Increasing the external glucose concentration to 16.8 mM leads to a rise in [Ca2+]i in both types of islets, although these rises were greatly reduced in the islets from CaM mice (Fig. 1). The rises in [Ca2+]i produced by the high glucose treatment were quantified by measuring the difference between the resting [Ca2+]i levels and the peak [Ca2+]i levels determined in the presence of 16.8 mM glucose (Fig. 2B). The glucose-induced rise in [Ca2+]i in islets from CaM mice (n = 6) was significantly smaller than that in islets from control mice (n = 7) (p < 0.05).Figure 2A, resting [Ca2+]i in control and CaM islets; B, net rise in [Ca2+]iproduced by stimulating islets from control and CaM mice with 16.8 mM glucose (*, p < 0.05); C, net rise in [Ca2+]iobtained when the same islets were exposed to 16.8 mM glucose plus 50 mM K+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because it has been suggested that the glucose-induced [Ca2+]i response of isolated beta cells differs from that of islets(16Smolen P. Rinzel J. Sherman A. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1668-1680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we also measured [Ca2+]i in single dissociated beta cells loaded with Indo-I. As was found for isolated islets, individual beta cells from either control or CaM animals that were treated with low glucose (2.8 mM) solution showed similar resting [Ca2+]i values, while exposure to solutions containing 16.8 mM glucose resulted in robust rises in [Ca2+]i in control cells, but much smaller responses in CaM cells. The peak rise in [Ca2+]i produced by 16.8 mM glucose was 428 ± 85 nM in 29 control cells and 50 ± 7 nM in 31 CaM cells (p < 0.05). Because this defect in [Ca2+]i signaling could be responsible for the attenuation of glucose-sensitive insulin secretion in the CaM mice, we performed additional experiments to identify the source of the defect in [Ca2+]i signaling and the role of this defect in the secretory phenotype of the mice.Ion Channels Are Normal in CaM Beta CellsGiven that voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are the primary source of [Ca2+]i that triggers insulin secretion(8Rajan A.S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Yaney G.C. Hsu W.H. Kunze D.L. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 340-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), the defective glucose-induced [Ca2+]i response in the CaM beta cells suggested that opening of these channels might be impaired. We therefore examined the properties of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels to determine whether or not they permitted Ca2+ to enter the beta cell. Our initial measure of entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels was to examine the [Ca2+]i changes resulting from depolarization of the beta cell membrane potential by treatment with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate containing an elevated (50 mM) K+ concentration. Treatment with high K+, in addition to glucose, should depolarize the membrane potential sufficiently to open voltage-gated Ca2+ channels(8Rajan A.S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Yaney G.C. Hsu W.H. Kunze D.L. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 340-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). K+-induced depolarization of control islets loaded with fura-2 produced a prompt elevation of [Ca2+]i, as shown in Fig. 1. The peak rise in [Ca2+]i attained in control islets during exposure to the high K+ solution was ∼400 nM above the resting level (Fig. 2C). Likewise, treatment of islets from CaM mice with solution containing 50 mM K+ produced comparable rises in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1), with no significant difference between the mean responses recorded from the two populations of islets (Fig. 2C). Additional experiments performed on isolated beta cells from normal and CaM mice also yielded similar [Ca2+]i rises in response to treatment with the high K+ solution (data not shown). Thus, measurements of depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i signals suggest that the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels of beta cells from CaM mice are able to open and admit Ca2+.A more direct measure of Ca2+ channel activity can be obtained from electrical measurements of beta cell Ca2+ currents(17Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 18Sakmann B. Neher E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1984; 46: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We therefore used whole-cell patch clamp recording methods (19Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15093) Google Scholar) to examine the currents resulting from Ca2+ channel gating. Cesium ions were added to the intracellular medium to block currents flowing through K+ channels and thereby allow measurement of Ca2+ channel currents in isolation. Families of Ca2+ currents recorded from both control and CaM beta cells are shown in Fig. 3A. These Ca2+ currents do not obviously differ between the two types of cells. In both cases, stepping the membrane potential from a holding level of -70 mV to potentials of -50 mV or more positive resulted in activation of an inward Ca2+ current. There were no consistent differences in the voltage dependence of these currents, as can been seen in the current-voltage curves shown in Fig. 3B. In both cases, peak current was attained at ∼0 mV, and the current reversed its polarity at approximately +50 mV. Peak current density, determined after dividing by the membrane capacitance to normalize for cell-to-cell variations in cell area, was not statistically different when comparing 23 control (18.1 ± 1.3 pA/pF) and 21 CaM (15.2 ± 1.43 pA/pF) beta cells (p > 0.10). Furthermore, there were no consistent differences in the kinetics of the Ca2+ currents between beta cells from normal and CaM mice (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that the deficit in glucose-induced [Ca2+]i signals in the CaM beta cells is not due to a change in the density or gating properties of Ca2+ channels.Figure 3Whole-cell Ca2+ currents in pancreatic beta cells.

We began our consideration of this possibility by characterizing delayed rectifier K+ currents. These currents were examined in isolation by including, in the intracellular patch pipette solution, EGTA (a Ca2+ buffer that blocks elevation of [Ca2+]i that would activate Ca2+-dependent K+ currents) and ATP to block ATP-sensitive K+ currents(20Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Smith P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 423: 327-342Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The currents measured under these conditions were blocked by extracellular application of tetraethylammonium ions (data not shown), a well known blocker of delayed rectifier K+ current in beta cells(20Bokvist K. Rorsman P. Smith P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 423: 327-342Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), providing pharmacological validation of the isolation procedure. Fig. 4A illustrates families of delayed rectifier K+ currents activated by depolarization under these conditions. The time course and magnitude of these outward currents were very similar in beta cells taken from the control and CaM lines. Membrane current density was calculated by dividing the current amplitude by the membrane capacitance, to take into account differences in membrane area. The voltage dependence of this parameter was very similar for delayed rectifier K+ currents from both control (n = 25) and CaM (n = 15) beta cells (Fig. 4B). In both cases, delayed rectifier currents appeared at membrane potentials of -60 mV and increased in magnitude at more positive potentials. The peak delayed rectifier conductance measured at +30 mV was calculated to be 1.21 ± 0.24 nS/pF in control cells and 0.90 ± 0.14 nS/pF in CaM cells, a difference that is not statistically significant (p > 0.20). These data indicate that the delayed rectifier K+ channels are functionally equivalent between control and CaM beta cells.Figure 4Delayed rectifier K+ currents in control and CaM beta cells.

Ashcroft F.M. Cell. Signalling. 1990; 2: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the defect in CaM cells was caused by changes in K channels. We first examined the actions of the sulfonylurea drug tolbutamide. This drug acts by blocking ATP-sensitive K+ channels; the resulting depolarization of the beta cell membrane potential normally results in an increase in [Ca2+]i and triggering of insulin secretion(8Rajan A.S. Aguilar-Bryan L. Nelson D.A. Yaney G.C. Hsu W.H. Kunze D.L. Boyd III, A.E. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 340-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We measured [Ca2+]i in islets loaded with fura-2 to determine whether tolbutamide causes an elevation of [Ca2+]i in CaM islets. Addition of tolbutamide (1 mM) to the perifusate of resting islets resulted in sustained and reversible increases in [Ca2+]i in both CaM and control mice (Fig. 5A). These increases in [Ca2+]i presumably are due to tolbutamide depolarizing the membrane by blocking ATP-sensitive K+ channels. The peak rises in [Ca2+]i produced by tolbutamide did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in control and CaM islets (Fig. 5B). Likewise, tolbutamide restored the ability of CaM islets to secrete insulin. At resting conditions (2.8 mM glucose), both the CaM and control islets secreted insulin at about the same rate (Fig. 6). Addition of 1 mM tolbutamide increased the sensitivity of the islets to 2.8 mM glucose in both the control and CaM islets, with secretion levels attaining a 4-fold increase over basal rates. Further addition of 16.8 mM glucose potentiated the tolbutamide response in both lines by ∼15-fold over low glucose alone and 3.5-fold over low glucose plus tolbutamide. These data indicate that the tolbutamide block of K+ATP channels bypasses the defects in [Ca2+]i signaling and insulin secretion characteristic of CaM islets.Figure 5Tolbutamide induced rises in [Ca2+]i. A, [Ca2+]i was measured in islets from control and CaM mice. Perifusion of the islets was done in 2.8 mM glucose for 45 min to establish a base line. Addition of 1 mM tolbutamide to the solution (bar) increased [Ca2+]i in both types of islets.

https://openalex.org/W1995997026,"TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene promoter binding factor (TPBF) is a transactivator which binds to the TBP promoter element (TPE) sequence of the Acanthamoeba TBP gene promoter and stimulates transcription in vitro. We have isolated a cDNA clone encoding TPBF. TPBF is a polypeptide of 327 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 37 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence of TPBF shows no significant homology to other proteins. TPBF has two potential coiled-coil regions, a basic region, a proline-rich region, a histidine-rich N terminus, and a nuclear targeting sequence. The recombinant protein has an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa, identical with that of TPBF purified from Acanthamoeba. Recombinant TPBF is able to bind DNA and activate transcription with the same specificity as natural Acanthamoeba TPBF, demonstrating the authenticity of the clone. Mobility shift assays of co-translated TPBF polypeptides and chemical cross-linking demonstrate that TPBF is tetrameric in solution and when bound to DNA. Analyses of TPBF mutants show that Coiled-coil II is essential for DNA binding, but Coiled-coil I and the basic region are also involved. TPBF is thus a novel DNA-binding protein with functional similarity to the tumor suppressor protein p53.

This TFIID-DNA complex then recruits other general transcription factors, such as TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase II to form a complete initiation complex(17Buratowski S. Cell. 1994; 77: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). An additional class of transcription factors, known as sequence-specific transcription activators, is involved in efficient transcription by RNA polymerase II. These activators bind specifically to promoter sequences and modulate levels of expression of the selected genes, providing a regulatory strategy for eukaryotic cells to control development, differentiation, and their responses to extracellular stimuli. Evidence obtained in recent years suggests that sequence-specific activators stimulate transcription through direct or indirect (via coactivators) communication with the general transcription factors.

Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) have been reported. However, the mechanism of transcription stimulation is not well understood. Typical eukaryotic transcription activators are composed of discrete structural domains that have specific functions(27Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), for example, in multimerization, DNA binding, and transcription activation or repression. Different structural motifs involved in DNA binding and activation have been identified and used to classify transcription activators. A fully functional activator can be constructed by combination of functional domains from different activators(28Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The Acanthamoeba TBP gene promoter contains two major elements that are necessary for efficient transcription. The TATA box at -30 functions by binding TFIID, which is necessary for basal transcription(29Wong J. Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4817-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Radebaugh C.A. Matthews J.L. Geiss G.K. Liu F. Wong J.-M. Bateman E. Camier S. Sentenac A. Paule M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The TPE is a 23-base pair element centered around -90, which stimulates basal transcription up to 10-fold in vitro. The TPE binds a regulatory factor called TPBF (31Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which was identified and purified previously in this laboratory (31Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TPBF is of interest because it regulates TBP gene transcription, but also because it is an apparently novel type of DNA-binding protein. Chemical interference assays demonstrated protein-DNA contacts on opposite faces of the DNA helix(32Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pattern, while reminiscent of the proposed model for p53 tetramer bound to DNA(33Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar), is distinct from that produced by other factors(32Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although TPBF was found by gel filtration to be oligomeric(32Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the resolution was not sufficient to distinguish trimeric and tetrameric forms of the protein. Finally, TPBF is phosphorylated, and removal of phosphate increased DNA binding, suggesting that phosphorylation could play a regulatory function in vivo. In order to determine the basis for these properties of TPBF and to permit further characterization of its role and mechanism in TBP gene expression, we isolated cDNA and genomic DNA clones encoding TPBF. Expression and analysis of cloned TPBF and mutant derivatives demonstrate that TPBF is a novel tetrameric DNA-binding protein. It contains a C-terminal coiled-coil domain necessary for tetramerization, as well as an apparently large central region involved in DNA binding. Other structural features of TPBF are discussed. Purification of TPBF essentially followed the scheme described elsewhere(32Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TPBF (~5 μg) was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel(34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. et al.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar), then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems), and visualized by Ponceau S staining(35Matsudaira P.

Academic Press, New York1993Google Scholar). The TPBF band was cut out and used for tryptic digestion and internal amino acid sequencing by the Harvard Microchemistry Laboratory(36Matsudaira P. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Three peptides were sequenced (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequences -AFQSNYR- in peptide II and -PYLTDDA- in peptide III were used to design two sets of degenerate oligonucleotides for PCR amplification of the target gene. Two pairs of degenerate primers were synthesized corresponding to amino acid sequences -AFQSNYR- and -PYLTDDA-. 1) GC(G/C)TTCCAGTC(G/C)AACTACCG; 2) CGGTAGTT(G/C)GACTGGAA(G/C)GC; 3) CC(G/C)TACCT(G/C)AC(G/C)GA(C/T)GA(C/T)GC; 4) GC(G/A)TC(G/A)TC(G/C)GT(G/C)AGGTA(G/C)CG. Amplification of Acanthamoeba castellanii genomic DNA (37Hammer J.A. Bowers B. Paterson B.M. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by PCR was performed under the following cycle conditions: the first cycle at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 48°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min, and the last cycle at 72°C for 10 min. Several PCR products were generated using either primer combination (data not shown). The products were subcloned into the pSK(-) vector (Stratagene) and sequenced. One subclone, encoding the TPBF peptides, was obtained. Using the subcloned PCR fragment as a probe, an A. castellanii cDNA library in λZAP (38Wong J. Liu F. Bateman E. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was screened. The cDNA library was plated out on twenty 15-cm plates, each containing approximately 50,000 plaques. The plaques were blotted onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell), and the DNA was denatured, neutralized, and immobilized(34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. et al.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). The filters were prehybridized at 65°C for 2 h in 500 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and denatured salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml), and then hybridized with a 32P-labeled TPBF probe for 12 h at 65°C. Filters were then washed twice for 10 min at room temperature with 500 ml of 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and once for 15 min at 65°C with 500 ml of 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Positive clones were rescued as double-stranded plasmids in the pSK(-) vector(39Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). To obtain a genomic clone of TPBF gene, an Acanthamoeba genomic DNA library, constructed in λEMBL3A (29Wong J. Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4817-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was screened using the cDNA-derived probe. One positive TPBF genomic clone was mapped to an 8-kilobase PstI fragment. The 8-kilobase fragment was subcloned into the pSK(-) vector and partially sequenced by primers derived from the cDNA sequence. Total cellular RNA was isolated using guanidine isothiocyanate(38Wong J. Liu F. Bateman E. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40MacDonald R.J. Swift G.H. Przybyla A.E. Chirgwin J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 219-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), and mRNA was selected by two rounds of chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Life Technologies, Inc.). Samples of 10 μg of mRNA were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel(34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. et al.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar), transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized with the 32P-labeled cDNA-derived probe as described above. Acanthamoeba genomic DNA was prepared as described elsewhere(37Hammer J.A. Bowers B. Paterson B.M. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 2-μg aliquots were digested with BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, MboI, HpaII, or MspI and separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Following depurination, the DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, DuPont NEN) and probed with 32P-labeled cDNA(34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. et al.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). 2 μg of mRNA was dissolved in 10 μl of annealing buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 0.4 M KCl and mixed with 50,000 to 100,000 cpm of labeled primer RT1 (GATGTGTGACAGATCATGGGTGCTGTT). The annealing reaction was incubated at 65°C for 10 min and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Primer extension (40 μl) was begun by adding 4 μl of 10 × reverse transcription buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 60 mM MgCl2, 25 mM DTT), 4 μl of dNTP mix (2.5 mM each), 1 unit of RNasin, and 20 units of Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.), followed by incubation for 1 h at 42°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Primer extension products were recovered by ethanol precipitation, dissolved in formamide loading buffer, and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel in TBE buffer (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. et al.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). Reverse transcription of mRNA was performed as described above except 5 ng of nonlabeled primer RT2 (TGGCCATGGGCACGCTCATCA) was used. The reaction was extracted with phenol-chloroform once, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 10 μl of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA) buffer. 1 μl of reverse transcription product was amplified by PCR using primer RT 2 and a primer designed from the TPBF genomic DNA sequence with an NdeI restriction site at its 5′ end (CATATGGAACATCAACAAGTTC). The PCR product was subsequently subcloned into pSK(-) vector and sequenced. To reconstruct a full-length TPBF cDNA, the 5′ one-third of the original cDNA clone was removed by digestion with KpnI and NcoI and replaced with the reverse transcription-PCR product. The full-length cDNA was then cut out from the pSK(-) vector with NdeI and BamHI, gel-purified, and ligated into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET3a expression vector (Novagen). The expression vector containing the full-length cDNA was digested with XhoI and religated to create a mutant TPBF missing amino acids 254 to 296, which encodes part of Coiled-coil II (Fig. 1B). To express full-length or mutant TPBF, Escherichia coli LE392 (Novagen) was freshly transformed with the expression vector and grown to an A600 of 0.8 in LB media supplemented with 0.2% maltose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. 1 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml of bacteriophage λCE6 (Novagen, (41Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendroff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar)) and 10 mM of MgSO4 were added to the culture to start infection. The culture was incubated at 30°C for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mM imidazole, and 500 mM NaCl, and sonicated three times for 30 s. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min to remove debris. Full-length or mutant TPBF was purified from cell lysates using immobilized Ni2+ (His•Bind resin, Novagen) according to the supplier's recommendations, except that recombinant TPBF was eluted with 300 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled, diluted 10-fold with the buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10% glycerol, and applied to a DEAE-cellulose (Whatman) column equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mM KCl. The bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 300 mM KCl. Fractions containing TPBF were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 100 mM KCl. Samples were stored at -80°C. 1.5 mg of TPBF was purified from E. coli cells as described above. The sample was purified further by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Polyclonal antibodies were produced by injecting a rabbit with gel slices containing TPBF (performed by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). The antisera were tested for specificity by immunoblotting of Acanthamoeba nuclear extracts using the conditions described below. To construct C-terminal and N-terminal deletion mutants, full-length TPBF cDNA in pSK(-) vector was used as a template for PCR amplification. Fragments for the N-terminal deletion series were generated by PCR using appropriate N-terminal primers and the reverse primer (Stratagene). The PCR products were subcloned into the EcoRV site of pSK(-) vector, downstream of the T7 polymerase promoter. The orientation of the inserts was confirmed by digestion with XhoI. The same strategy was employed to generate C-terminal deletions except the appropriate C-terminal primers were used in combination with the primer starting from the first methionine site (see above for sequence). Removal of an internal fragment from the full-length cDNA was achieved by digestion of the construct with SstI and religation, producing the internal deletion mutant of TPBF (Δ127-253). Junctions of all constructs for TPBF mutants were sequenced. In vitro protein syntheses from plasmids encoding full-length and mutant TPBF were carried out with the Single Tube Protein System 2 (Novagen) in which transcription driven by T7 RNA polymerase is coupled to translation by a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (42Craig D. Howell M.T. Gibbs C.L. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4987-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine (DuPont NEN) was incorporated into synthesized proteins. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The double-stranded 27-mer DNA fragment containing the Acanthamoeba TBP gene promoter sequence between -96 and -70 was used as the probe for EMS assays(32Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For protein-DNA binding reactions, end-labeled DNA probe was incubated with 5 ng of purified native Acanthamoeba TPBF or purified recombinant TPBF or with 1-2-μl aliquots of TPBF synthesized in the in vitro transcription-translation reaction mixtures. The reaction conditions were as described previously(31Liu F. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4321-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For the experiments shown in Fig. 4B and Fig. 8A, protein-DNA complexes were analyzed under the previously described conditions. For the experiments in Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8:B, the reactions were run on 6% native polyacrylamide gels at 10 V/cm for 5 h.Figure 8:DNA binding activity of TPBF deletion mutants. 5 ng of natural Acanthamoeba TPBF or 2 μl of in vitro synthesized TPBF polypeptides indicated in Fig. 7 were analyzed.

Glutaraldehyde or DTSSP (3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate), Pierce), a thiol-cleavable reagent, was used as cross-linker. 200 ng of purified recombinant TPBF or ~20 ng of partially purified natural Acanthamoeba TPBF was incubated in DNA binding buffer without DTT and without DNA(32Liu F. Bateman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18541-18548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed with a 25- to 50-fold molar excess of freshly prepared DTSSP solution or 0.001% glutaraldehyde. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and quenched with 50 mM lysine. In some experiments, DTSSP cross-linked proteins were cleaved by incubation with 50 mM DTT at 37°C for 30 min if necessary. Samples were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were either stained with silver (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. et al.Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar) or electroblotted for Western blotting analysis (see below). Proteins were transferred from a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to a nitrocellulose filter in a Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad) using the conditions specified by the supplier. The membrane was blocked using 5% dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min. It was then incubated with 1:200 diluted anti-TPBF sera for 30 min, followed by another 30-min incubation with 1:5000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham). The membrane was washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 after each incubation period. Signals were detected using a Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). Acanthamoeba TPBF was purified and subjected to internal sequencing as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amino acid sequences of three peptides were obtained (Fig. 1A) and were used to design degenerate oligonucleotides for use in amplification of genomic DNA. PCR yielded a specific 200-bp fragment, which was subcloned and sequenced. 1 × 106 plaques of an Acanthamoeba cDNA library were screened, and three positive cDNA clones were identified. All three clones contained sequences encoding peptides I, II, and III (Fig. 1A). Both strands of one of the cDNA clones were then completely sequenced. The 1060-bp cDNA contains an open reading frame of 280 amino acids, encoding a polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 30 kDa. The three clones had identical 5′ ends, but were not full-length based on the following observations: 1) there is a large discrepancy between the apparent size of natural Acanthamoeba TPBF (50-51 kDa) and the deduced size predicted from the cDNA; 2) the single open reading frame extends to the 5′ end of the cDNA; 3) primer extension of mRNA using a primer located 100 bp from the 5′ end of the cDNAs generated a product of 150 nucleotides (Fig. 2C and see below), which suggested that 50 bp was missing from the cDNA clone. We used “rapid amplification of cDNA ends” (43Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar) to obtain the missing 5′ end of the cDNA. In order to find a rapid amplification of cDNA ends primer, we isolated a genomic clone encoding TPBF and partially sequenced it. Two in-frame methionines were found in the 50-bp sequence preceding the 5′ end of the cDNA within the genomic copy of the TPBF gene. Using the primer starting from the first in-frame methionine in combination with primer RT2, we successfully obtained the missing part of the cDNA from mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR and reconstructed the full-length cDNA. The complete (both strands) sequence of the reconstructed TPBF cDNA is presented in Fig. 1A. The complete cDNA comprises 1088 bp and contains an open reading frame of 327 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 37 kDa (Fig. 1A). There are several sequence motifs of potential importance to the function of TPBF as a transcription activator. First, it bears a putative nuclear localization signal of 5 consecutive basic residues KKRRK (residues 132-136, Fig. 1), which appears in many transcription factors(44Boulikas T. J.

Although mammalian transport activity has been characterized by kinetic studies, the actual protein itself has yet to be identified, purified, or cloned. As one approach to this problem, we attempted photoaffinity labeling of plasma membrane proteins using two specifically designed and synthesized polyamine conjugates as photoprobes.

Cell proliferation is critically dependent on a constant supply of the intracellular polyamines: putrescine, spermidine (Spd), ( 1The abbreviations used are: SpdspermidineSpmspermineASAazidosalicylamidoethylBoctert-butyloxycarbonylCbzbenzyloxycarbonylDESpmN1,N12-diethylspermine (also known as BESPM, N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine)N1-ASA-nSpmN1-azidosalicylamido-norspermineN4-ASA-SpdN4-azidosalicylamidoethyl-spermidineNHS-ASAN-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acidp118predominant plasma membrane protein labeled with polyamine photoprobe at 118 kDap50plasma membrane protein labeled with polyamine photoprobe at 50 kDaTLCthin layer chromatographyMGBGmethylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone).) and spermine (Spm). Under in vivo conditions, this supply is thought to be maintained by sensitively regulated processes involving polyamine biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport. While the key enzymes responsible for biosynthesis and catabolism of polyamines have been biochemically purified, characterized, and cloned, the putative proteins responsible for polyamine transport in mammalian systems have, thus far, only been studied at the functional level. spermidine spermine azidosalicylamidoethyl tert-butyloxycarbonyl benzyloxycarbonyl N1,N12-diethylspermine (also known as BESPM, N1,N12-bis(ethyl)spermine) N1-azidosalicylamido-norspermine N4-azidosalicylamidoethyl-spermidine N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid predominant plasma membrane protein labeled with polyamine photoprobe at 118 kDa plasma membrane protein labeled with polyamine photoprobe at 50 kDa thin layer chromatography methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone). From kinetic studies, polyamine transport is known to be an active process that is energy- and temperature-dependent and adheres to Michaelis-Menten kinetics(1Gawel-Thompson K. Greene R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2Khan N.A. Quemener V. Moulinoux J-P. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Dave C. Caballes L. Fed. Proc. 1973; 32: 736Google Scholar). Although the transporter is highly specific for polyamines, various synthetic molecules such as polyamine analogs, methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG), and paraquat utilize the carrier as a primary means for gaining entry into cells(4Seiler N. Dezeure F. Int. J. Biochem. 1990; 22: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). By contributing to their intracellular accumulation, the transporter undoubtedly determines their in vitro and in vivo pharmacological behavior and hence their therapeutic potential. Like polyamine biosynthesis, polyamine transport is sensitively and negatively regulated by intracellular pools. Polyamine depletion results in increases in uptake, while polyamine excess causes decreases in transport(5Kankinuma Y. Hoshino K. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Byers T.L. Pegg A.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Kramer D.L. Miller J.M. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the absence of appropriate molecular probes, the basis for regulation of polyamine transport remains uncertain. Recent findings suggest that, like the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase, transport may be at least partially regulated by antizyme, which apparently contributes to the regulated degradation of these proteins(8Suzuki T. He Y. Kashiwagi K. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Mitchell J.L.A. Judd G.G. Bareyal-Leyser A. Ling S.Y. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In order to investigate such possibilities more directly, the mammalian transporter needs to be purified and/or cloned. Due to the relatively weak ionic interactions between polyamines and their receptors, standard means of isolation and purification such as affinity chromatography have not proved useful in such systems. Efforts to clone the protein have included cross-species transfection of DNA from transport-positive cells into transport-negative cells as has been done with the proteins involved in folate transport(10Williams F.M. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Efforts by Byers et al. (11Byers T.L. Wechter R. Nuttall M.E. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) led to the transferal of polyamine transport activity by this means but not to the isolation of gene sequences encoding the transporter. In contrast to studies in mammalian systems, Igarashi and co-workers (12Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kashiwagi K. Suzuki T. Suzuki F. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have used this approach in bacterial systems to isolate the genes encoding multiple polyamine transporters of Escherichia coli. In this study, photoaffinity labeling was attempted in an effort to identify and characterize cell surface proteins in mammalian systems that bind polyamines and may be involved in polyamine transport. The approach allows for the covalent modification of specific protein sites by the activation of a light-labile moiety affixed to a particular ligand. First proposed by Ji(15Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1566-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), photolabeling has proved useful in the identification of various plasma membrane transporters and surface receptors(16Shanahan M.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6487-6495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions designed to optimize selective interaction with plasma membrane proteins, custom-synthesized polyamine photoprobes (Fig. 1) were used to modify covalently putative polyamine binding sites. This approach led to the identification of a plasma membrane polyamine binding protein having a molecular mass of ~118 kDa and demonstrating high specific activity of labeling with the polyamine photoprobes; its relevance to polyamine transport is uncertain. These studies have been previously presented in abstract form(18Felschow D.M. MacDiarmid J. Bardos T. Wu R. Woster P.M. Porter C.W. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1995; 36: 507Google Scholar). MGBG and Spd were purchased as hydrochloride salts from Sigma. Dr. R. Bergeron (University of Florida, Gainesville) kindly supplied the polyamine analog N1,N12-diethylspermine (DESpm). The photoreactive reagent used in control studies, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid (NHS-ASA) was acquired through Pierce. All radioisotopes were purchased from Dupont NEN in the amount of 1 mCi. The radionuclide Na125I was obtained in nonreducing form with a pH range of 8-10. Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Parental L1210 murine lymphocytic leukemia cells and a subline (L1210/MG) made polyamine transport-deficient by chronic exposure to MGBG (19Persson L. Holm I. Ask A. Heby O. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4807-4811PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. O. Heby (University of Umea, Sweden). Human U937 lymphoma cells were acquired through American Type Cell Cultures (Rockville, MD). Murine L1210 cells and human U937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 60 units/ml penicillin, 60 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Mycoplasma tests (GenProbe Kit, GenProbe, San Diego, CA) were carried out periodically to ensure contamination-free cultures. For dose-response determinations with MGBG, cells were seeded in triplicate wells of a 24-well plate and treated with increasing concentrations of MGBG simultaneously. After 48 h, cell growth was analyzed with an automated cell counter (Coulter, Miami Lakes, FL). The mean of the control cell growth was used to calculate percentage control cell values. Spd uptake kinetics were performed on L1210 cells as described by Kramer et al.(7Kramer D.L. Miller J.M. Bergeron R.J. Porter C.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Michaelis-Menten values of transport velocity Vmax (pmol/min/cell number) and binding affinity Kt (μM) were generated. Competition kinetics with photoprobes at 100 μM were carried out, and results were expressed as Ki values (μM). Inhibition constants for DESpm and MGBG were generated at concentrations of 10 μM and 100 μM, respectively. Spd accumulation was evaluated by incubating L1210 cells in prewarmed medium containing 4 μM [3H]Spd. Triplicate samples were incubated in a 37°C water bath or at 4°C for up to 60 min. Samples were placed on ice and chased once with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing unlabeled 50 μM Spd and then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were solubilized with 1 N NaOH at 60°C for 30 min and neutralized with 1 N HCl, and the entire lysate plus scintillant was counted by a Beckman scintillation counter model LS1800. Synthesis of the photoprobe N4-ASA-Spd began with N1,N8-bis(Boc)-4-benzylspermidine prepared according to Bergeron and Garlich(20Bergeron R.J. Garlich J.R. Synthesis. 1984; : 782-785Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This was debenzylated to N1, N8-bis(Boc)spermidine hydrochloride by hydrogenation with 0.95 equivalents of 11 N HCl over a palladium/carbon catalyst until the calculated volume of H2 had been consumed. The hydrochloride was refluxed overnight with 5% molar excess of 2-bromoethyl phthalimide, 3 molar equivalents of sodium carbonate, and 0.25 molar equivalent of KI in mixed xylenes. Column chromatography of the crude reaction product on silica gel with ethyl ether yielded 44% of N1,N8-bis(Boc)-4-(2-phthalimidoethyl)spermidine. To remove the phthaloyl-protecting group, the compound was dissolved in ethanol and treated with 3.5 M excess of anhydrous hydrazine. The precipitated phthalhydrazide was filtered out, and the residue was concentrated. Under low light conditions, equimolar amounts of N1,N8-bis(Boc)-4-(2-aminoethyl)spermidine and the photoreactive donor, NHS-ASA (Pierce), were stirred overnight in acetonitrile. The concentrated reaction mixture was column-chromatographed on silica gel and eluted with 10% methanol/ethyl acetate, and the desired fractions were pooled and concentrated. The infrared spectrum featured a strong N3 band at 2115 cm-1. Removal of the Boc-protecting groups from the terminal amines was accomplished by redissolving the photoreagent in dioxane, stirring it with an equal volume of 8 N HCl/dioxane for 3 h, and then concentrating and evacuating it. In order to eliminate the residual dioxane, the product was dissolved in slightly warm anhydrous ethanol and precipitated by addition of ethyl ether. The solvents were decanted, and the residue was dried in vacuo. Purity was assessed by TLC on silica gel using 3:1:1 isopropyl alcohol/methanol/ammonium hydroxide. The one (well defined) spot had an RF value of 0.18. Elemental analysis showed trace impurities believed to be retained solvent traces; hence, the calculated purity was 89.7%. Because the azidosalicylic acid (ASA) moiety was affixed via an alkyl linkage, the Spd moiety retained charges at all three nitrogens (Fig. 1). The synthesis of N1-ASA-nSpm began with the commercially available intermediate 3-bromopropylamine hydrochloride, which was converted to the corresponding N-(p-NO2-Cbz) derivative (21Berse C. Boucher R. Piche L. J. Org. Chem. 1957; 22: 805-808Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) by treating it with 4-nitrobenzylchloroformate. The resulting bromopropylcarbamate was then condensed with the previously described intermediate 1-phthalimido-4-(N-benzyl)-7-{[(2-mesitylene)sulfonyl]amino}-4-azaheptane (22Saab N.H. West E.E. Bieszk N.C. Preuss C.V. Mank A.R. Casero R.A. Woster P.M. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 2998-3004Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) in the presence of sodium hydride to afford a heterogenously tetraprotected intermediate possessing the requisite norspermine backbone. In order to preserve the amide linkage in the immediate precursor to the target photoprobe, it was necessary to manipulate the nitrogen-protecting groups early in the synthesis to produce an intermediate that could be deprotected under mild conditions. Thus, the mesityl-protecting group was removed by treatment with 30% HBr in acetic acid(23Roemmele R.C. Rapoport H. J. Org. Chem. 1988; 53: 2367-2371Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the resulting secondary nitrogen was reprotected as the corresponding N-(p-NO2-Cbz) derivative (21Berse C. Boucher R. Piche L. J. Org. Chem. 1957; 22: 805-808Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The phthalimide was then removed by hydrazinolysis(24Jasys V.J. Kelbaugh P.R. Nason D.M. Phillips D. Rosnack K.J. Forman J.T. Saccomano N.A. Stroh J.G. Volkmann R.A. J. Org. Chem. 1992; 57: 1814-1820Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the resulting primary amine was converted to the corresponding N-Boc derivative(25Keller O. Keller W.E. van Look G. Wersin G. Org. Syn. 1985; 63: 160-171Crossref Google Scholar). The N-benzyl- and N-(p-NO2-Cbz)-protecting groups were simultaneously removed by hydrogenolysis (26Rylander P.N. Rylander P.N. Hydrogenation Methods. Academic Press, Inc., New York1985: 163-165Google Scholar) to afford a norspermine derivative in which one of the two primary nitrogens was protected. The primary nitrogen in this intermediate was then reacted regiospecifically with the commercially available reagent NHS-ASA(27Tae H. Inhae J. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 121: 286-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), yielding the penultimate precursor to the target photoprobe. This intermediate, as well as the target molecule, were protected from light at all times to avoid premature photolysis. Removal of the N-Boc-protecting group under mild conditions (trifluoroacetic acid, room temperature, 1 h) then afforded the target molecule N1-ASA-nSpm as the trifluoroacetate salt. All intermediates in the pathway including the target photoprobe were fully characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy, and all spectra were consistent with the assigned structures. Purity was assessed to be ~95%. Because the ASA moiety was affixed to a terminal amine via an acyl linkage, the recognizable polyamine moiety based on charge was that of norspermine (i.e. having three charged nitrogens). Radioiodination of the photoprobes was carried out with [125I]IODO-BEADS iodination reagent (Pierce) in the dark under a red safety light filter. The procedure followed the manufacturer's instructions, using 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in equivolume with the individual photoprobe(s) at 10 mM. The 125I-iodinated probe was cleaned of any free radionuclide by reverse phase column chromatography. Octadecyl columns obtained from J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ) were prepared as per the manufacturer's recommendations. The radioactive solution was added to the column by vacuum pressure, and the void volume was collected. The C18 column was rinsed twice with sodium phosphate buffer, and each wash was collected. The sample was eluted from the column by a methanol, 0.1 N HCl wash. Each wash and sample eluate was tested for the presence of the photoprobe by spotting 2 μl on fluorescent thin layer chromatography paper and viewing with a short wavelength lamp. The MeOH/HCl eluate was the only positively fluorescent spot. The sample was then dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen and redissolved in sodium phosphate buffer. Each of the eluates and the final redissolved sample was counted in a Beckman γ counter, model Gamma 5500. The concentration of the iodinated and the noniodinated photoprobe was calculated by using a previously determined extinction coefficient (data not shown) at the wavelength of 267 nm. The specific activity of the polyamine photoprobes generally ranged from 0.7 to 2 × 108 cpm/μmol, while the specific activity of the unconjugated photoprobe NHS-[125I]ASA was 7 × 108 cpm/μmol. Photolabeling followed a modification of the procedure used by Price and Freisheim (28Price E.M. Freisheim J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 198: 4757-4765Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in labeling plasma membrane folate binding proteins. Briefly, cells were suspended to a density of 2 × 108 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 g/liter CaCl2 and 2 g/liter glucose and treated with the 35-100 μM of the 125I-iodinated N4-ASA-Spd or N1-ASA-Spm photoprobe in the dark under a red safety light filter at 4°C to prevent internalization of probe. Samples were then rapidly transferred to one well of a six-well plate and incubated on ice for 5 min, after which cells were exposed to uv light for 3 min. The light source was a Mineralight (Gabriel, CA) 115 V, 50 c.cyc. The plate containing cells was positioned approximately 5 cm from the wide range (254-320 nm) filter. Immediately following uv cross-linking 100 μM dithiothreitol was added to scavenge unreacted probe(29Staros J.V. Bayley H. Standring D.N. Knowles J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Samples were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and suspended in a buffer comprising 0.05 M boric acid, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml of leupeptin, aprotinin, and 10 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma)). Following hand homogenization of labeled cells, plasma membranes were isolated by sucrose fractionation according to the procedure of Thom et al. (30Thom D. Powell A.J. Lloyd C.W. Rees D.A. Biochem J. 1977; 80: 649-654Google Scholar). Final membrane preparations were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline. Plasma membrane proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel according to the procedure of Laemmli(31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gels were fixed and stained with 0.25% Coomassie Blue in 50% methanol, 7% acetic acid. Destaining was carried out with 50% methanol, 7% acetic acid. The gel was then dried and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT-AR film with Dupont intensifying screen for 5-14 days. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted twice before resuspension in prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 g/liter CaCl2 and 2 g/liter glucose. Treatment with photoprobes at 2.5 μM was performed in the dark under a red safety light filter. Triplicate samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min while a fourth sample was left on ice as a subtraction control for passive accumulation of the photoprobe(s). After the incubation, cell samples were placed on ice and chased with 25 μM noniodinated photoprobe in cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were centrifuged and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then solubilized by the addition of 1 N NaOH at 60°C for 30 min and neutralized with 1 N HCl, and the lysate was counted in the Beckman γ counter. Earlier structure function studies involving polyamine uptake (32Porter C.W. Bergeron R.J. Stolowich N.J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4072-4078PubMed Google Scholar, 33Porter C.W. Cavanaugh P.F. Stolowich N. Ganis B. Kelly E. Bergeron R.J Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2050-2057PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that derivatization of Spd via an N4-alkyl linkage is better tolerated than derivatization at the N1 position. Thus, a Spd photoprobe was designed and synthesized in which the photoreactive group ASA was affixed to the N4 position of Spd via a 2-carbon alkyl bridge (Fig. 1). The purity of the compound was assessed via elemental analysis and thin layer chromatography and found to be 89.7%. The ability of N4-ASA-Spd photoprobe to compete with Spd for transport into murine L1210 leukemia cells was examined by Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters for uptake. With an apparent Ki of 52 μM, the photoprobe was found to be within the range of other compounds that utilize the polyamine transport system including MGBG, which competes in these cells with an apparent Ki of 71 μM (Table 1). Since photoaffinity probes with binding constants in the low micromolar range have been used successfully in the labeling of plasma membrane proteins such as a folate binding protein(28Price E.M. Freisheim J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 198: 4757-4765Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we presumed that the N4-Spd conjugate could be similarly useful in photocross-linking of polyamine binding proteins at the cell surface.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Previous plasma membrane labeling protocols (34Findlay J.B.C. Evans W.H. Findlay J.B.C. Evans W.H. Biological Membranes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 197-213Google Scholar) have established that membrane cross-linking should be carried out at 4°C in order to minimize probe internalization and restrict labeling to the cell surface. To confirm this strategy, accumulation studies using [3H]Spd were performed to demonstrate that while large amounts of radioactivity were taken up by intact cells at 37°C, virtually none was accumulated at 4°C (Fig. 2). In accordance with previous protocols, all photoaffinity labeling was done at 4°C. In preliminary studies, concentrations of photoprobe at 100 μM were found to be saturating (data not shown). In order to conserve photoprobe, labeling was conducted at 35 μM unless otherwise indicated. Separation of proteins contained in plasma membrane preparations of photolabeled cells was achieved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Labeled proteins were then identified by autoradiography following exposures of 5-14 days. By Coomassie Blue staining, >60 separate protein bands were visible (Fig. 3). Of these, several were found by autoradiography to be diffusely labeled to varying degrees of intensity. Two, however, demonstrated a high specific activity of labeling, and both were found by Coomassie staining to represent relatively minor membrane proteins. The first was a prominent well-defined band at 118 kDa, and the second was a broader, more diffuse band at 50 kDa (Fig. 3). We have designated the former of these proteins p118 and the latter p50. To examine the possible relevance of p118 to polyamine transport activity, the plasma membrane protein labeling pattern in polyamine transport-deficient L1210/MG cells (19Persson L. Holm I. Ask A. Heby O. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4807-4811PubMed Google Scholar) was compared with that of parental L1210 cells. In agreement with the original studies by Persson et al.(19Persson L. Holm I. Ask A. Heby O. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4807-4811PubMed Google Scholar), L1210/MG cells were found to be ~1000-fold resistant to MGBG and to accumulate much less radiolabeled Spd than the parental cells (data not shown). By Coomassie Blue staining, no obvious difference in stained protein pattern was apparent between L1210 and L1210/MG cells (data not shown). Following photoaffinity labeling with the radioiodinated N4-Spd photoprobe (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3), it was observed that the primary labeled protein, p118, consistently exhibited a slightly higher molecular mass form in the L1210/MG cells, and the labeling of a minor band (100 kDa) was more apparent. Even following prolonged autoradiographic exposure (data not shown), no other differences in labeled protein bands were apparent between the parent and transport-deficient lines. Neuraminidase pretreatment was used to examine whether negatively charged sialic acid residues contributed to p118 labeling and to compare the glycosylation status of labeled proteins in L1210 and L1210/MG cells (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 4). This treatment failed to diminish labeling intensity, suggesting that sialic acid was not responsible for photoprobe binding. It did, however, produce a clear increase in mobility of p118 in both L1210 and L1210/MG cells, indicating that the protein was similarly glycosylated in both cell types. The specificity of p118 as a possible polyamine binding protein was evaluated by first comparing labeling with the unconjugated photoaffinity reagent NHS-ASA. In uptake studies, NHS-ASA was ineffective in competing with [3H]Spd for uptake into L1210 cells (Ki >100 μM). When the unconjugated probe NHS-ASA-125I was used to photolabel cells, the protein banding patterns were significantly different from those obtained with N4-ASA-[125I]Spd (Fig. 5). In particular, neither p118 nor p50 were significantly labeled, thus suggesting that the polyamine ligand of the photoprobe strongly influenced targeting specificity to sites on the plasma membrane. The labeling pattern was also compared with another photoaffinity reagent, N1-ASA-[125I]nSpm, which was synthesized in order to further evaluate the binding specificity of p118. With this conjugate, the ASA moiety is affixed via an acyl bond to the N1 of the polyamine so that the remaining three charged nitrogens of nSpd presumably are available to act as the binding determinants (Fig. 1). In uptake studies, the N1-nSpm conjugate competed with [3H]Spd transport more effectively than N4-ASA-Spd, with an apparent Ki value of 23 μM (Table 1). Thus, N1-ASA-nSpm was a potentially more specific photoaffinity reagent than the N4-conjugate. Although we demonstrated that N4-ASA-Spd and"

By screening a randomly mutagenized NF1-GRD library in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we isolated two NF1-GRD mutants (NF201 and NF204) with single amino acid substitutions, which suppress the heat shock-sensitive phenotype of the RAS2(G19V) mutant. The NF1-GRD mutants also suppress the oncogenic Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (Nakafuku, M., Nagamine, M., Ohtoshi, A., Tanaka, K., Toh-e, A., and Kaziro, Y. (1993) Proc.

In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the mutant NF1-GRDs attenuated the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by Ras(G12V), but not by platelet-derived growth factor. In cell-free systems, purified recombinant NF1-GRD mutants showed an inhibitory effect on the association of Ras•guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) with Raf at several times lower concentrations than the wild type. Furthermore, it was revealed that the binding affinity of the mutant NF1-GRDs toward Ras•GTPγS is approximately 5-10 times higher than the wild type.

INTRODUCTIONMammalian Ras protein acts as a molecular switch regulating intracellular signal transduction. Ras is implicated in various kinds of signaling pathways including proliferation of fibroblast cells, differentiation of pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, T-cell activation, and lymphokine-induced cellular responses in various hematopoietic cell lines. Activity of Ras is controlled by two types of regulators, GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs), ( 1The abbreviations used are: GEFGDP/GTP exchange factorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseGAPGTPase-activating proteinGDPβSguanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate)GRDGTPase-activating protein-related domainGSTglutathione S-transferaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)HEKhuman embryonic kidneyMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKMAP kinase or ERK kinaseNF1neurofibromatosis type 1PDGFplatelet-derived growth factor.) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). GEFs stimulate the GDP/GTP exchange reaction that causes the formation of active GTP-bound form, while GAPs enhance the GTPase activity to turn off the signal from Ras. Recently, it has been clarified that mSos-1, a member of GEFs, is involved in a signaling cascade from a receptor tyrosine kinase to Ras. However, the role of GAPs in a signal-dependent modulation of Ras•GDP/GTP state remains unclear (see (1Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol.

Neurofibromin belongs to a family of Ras-GAPs; it contains GAP-related domain (GRD), which is found in all mammalian and yeast GAPs(10Xu G. O'Connell P. Viskochil D. Cawthon R. Robertson M. Culver M. Dunn D. Stevens J. Gesteland R. White R. Weiss R. Cell. 1990; 62: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). In addition, NF1-GRD by itself has an ability to bind Ras protein, and to stimulate its GTPase activity in a cell-free system (11Ballester R. Marchuk D. Boguski M. Saulino A. Letcher R. Wigler M.

Two GAP-related genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, IRA1 and IRA2, were isolated and characterized as genes encoding GTPase stimulators of yeast Ras proteins(14Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Satoh T.

Not only GRD itself, but also its flanking regions in Ira1 and Ira2 proteins, share homology with the mammalian NF1 gene product; actually, NF1 protein is capable of interacting with yeast Ras proteins(14Tanaka K.

Nature. 1990; 347: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).By screening a library of NF1-GRD cDNA to which random mutation was introduced by chemical treatment, we have isolated two mutant NF1-GRD clones (designated NF201 and NF204) that suppress the heat shock-sensitive phenotype characteristic of a S. cerevisiae strain carrying an activated mutation (G19V) of Ras, but show no inhibitory effect on the normal growth(17Nakafuku M.

In NF201 and NF204, single amino acid substitutions (F1434L for NF201, and K1436R for NF204, respectively) were identified at neighboring positions, suggesting that this surrounding region is important for NF1-GRD/Ras interaction. These mutants exhibit no reduction in their GTPase-stimulating activity, and thus, they are able to complement ira phenotypes of S. cerevisiae. In addition, the obtained NF1-GRD mutants are able to revert the transformation-specific morphology of NIH 3T3-derived Ki-ras-transformed fibroblasts.In the present paper, we examined the effects of the mutant NF1-GRDs on the interaction of Ras with its effector, Raf, in whole cell and cell-free systems to clarify the mechanism of the anti-oncogenic action of the mutant NF1-GRDs. We found that the affinity of NF1-GRD mutants to the GTP-bound form of Ras is increased by 5-10-fold, suggesting that the mutants tightly bind to Ras•GTP to form a stable complex and block the interaction of oncogenic Ras with its target.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids, Recombinant Proteins, and AntibodiesMammalian expression plasmids pEF-NF1, pEF-NF201, and pEF-204 have been described elsewhere(17Nakafuku M.

Anti-Ras antibody Has 6 was a generous gift from Dr. Takeo Tanaka (Kure National Hospital, Kure, Japan). Human PDGF-BB was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Corp.), horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham), anti-Ras antibody LA069 (Quality Biotechnology, Inc., Camden, NJ), anti-mouse IgG (Cappel), anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Kodak), and anti-ERK2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were commercially purchased.Preparation of Rat Brain LysateRat brain lysate was prepared essentially according to the method described previously(24Koide H.

Briefly, rat brain was homogenized on ice in buffer A (20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) supplemented with 250 mM sucrose. 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 150 mM KCl were then added to the homogenate, and the lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min.Transient Expression in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 CellsHEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNA was introduced into the cell by a standard calcium phosphate method, and the culture medium was replaced by DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin on the next day. After additional culture for 1 day, the cells were harvested and lysed into buffer A plus 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 150 mM KCl. Cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min.Preparation of Ras•Guanine Nucleotide ComplexesRas protein was incubated in exchange buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NH4Cl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mM EDTA) in the presence of 1 mM GDPβS or GTPγS at 30°C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 mM MgCl2 and chilling on ice(18Satoh T. Nakamura S. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys.

Rat brain lysate (1.25 mg/ml) was added to the mixture, followed by incubation at 4°C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl), once with kinase buffer without phosphatase inhibitors, and suspended in kinase buffer (20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM MnCl2, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4). GST-MAP kinase (K57D) (100 μg/ml), His-MAP kinase kinase (33.5 μg/ml), and [γ-32P]ATP (50 μM, 37 TBq/mol) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 30°C for 10 min. The samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Radioactivity of each band was quantitated by a BAS 2000 image analyzer (Fuji Film).Co-immunoprecipitation of Ras and c-RafΔC-FH6Ras protein complexed with GDPβS or GTPγS (300 nM) and NF1-GRD were mixed with anti-Ras antibody LA069, anti-mouse IgG, and protein A-Sepharose suspended within buffer A. c-RafΔC-FH6 (60 nM) and rat brain lysate (0.63 mg/ml) was added to the mixture, followed by incubation at 4°C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl), and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody M2, horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents.Measurement of GTPase-stimulating ActivityA competition assay of GAP activity was carried out essentially as described elsewhere(25Schaber M.D. Garsky V.M.

[γ-32P]GTP-bound Ras was prepared by nucleotide exchange reaction in the presence of [γ-32P]GTP (74 TBq/mol). [γ-32P]GTP-bound Ras (5 nM), NF1-GRD (0.7 nM), and various concentrations of Ras•GTPγS were mixed in GTPase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 15 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and incubated at 30°C for 5 min. Radioactivity bound to Ras was measured by a filter binding assay described previously(18Satoh T. Nakamura S. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 949: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).RESULTSTwo types of NF1-GRD mutants (NF201 and NF204) inhibit activated Ras-induced phenotypes, but not normal cell growth, in both S. cerevisiae and mouse cells. Since NF1-GRD directly binds to Ras protein and regulates its GTPase activity, it seems likely that the anti-oncogenic action of NF201 and NF204 can be explained by their specific interference with the interaction between oncogenic Ras and its direct effector molecules.Our previous results indicated that, in Ki-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, the NF1-GRD mutants reversed malignant morphology of the transformed cells without blocking the normal growth(17Nakafuku M. Nagamine M. Ohtoshi A. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6706-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized transient expression systems to examine whether the mutant NF1-GRDs were capable of inhibiting the function of oncogenic, but not endogenous normal Ras. In various types of mammalian cells, the MAP kinase cascade is known to function downstream of Ras protein, where the activation of MAP kinase depends on the phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinase (MEK), and the phosphorylation of specific residues is known to be sufficient for its activation (see (26Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) and (27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar) for reviews). Thus, we introduced expression vectors containing the wild-type and mutant NF1-GRD cDNAs into HEK 293 cells and tested the effects on Ras-mediated hyper-phosphorylation of an endogenous MAP kinase (ERK2) (Fig. 1). In these experiments, phosphorylated ERK2 was detected as a mobility-retarded band blotted by an ERK2-specific antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 1, an activated mutant Ras(G12V) induced the phosphorylation of ERK2, which was diminished by simultaneous transfection of NF201 or NF204, but not of the wild-type NF1-GRD. Immunoblotting using anti-NF1-GRD antibody showed that the amounts of NF1-GRD expressed within each transfectant were equal (data not shown). The results indicate that the mutant NF1-GRDs effectively block the signaling from transforming Ras to MAP kinase in mammalian cells. We also tested the effects of NF201 and NF204 on the PDGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK2 mediated by the endogenous Ras protein. Phosphorylation of ERK2 in HEK 293 cells transfected with an expression plasmid of the PDGF receptor was detected after PDGF treatment for 10 min. Neither NF201 nor NF204, when expressed with the PDGF receptor in HEK 293 cells, caused inhibition of PDGF-promoted MAP kinase phosphorylation, whereas the PDGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK2 disappeared when a dominant-negative mutant Ras (S17N) was expressed, suggesting that the endogenous Ras is implicated in the signaling pathway from the PDGF receptor to MAP kinase (data not shown).To further assess the hypothesis that the NF1 mutants suppress the function of Ras(G12V) by binding more strongly than the wild-type NF1-GRD, we next compared the ability of the wild-type and mutant NF1-GRDs to inhibit the interaction of Ras and its effector in cell-free systems. Specific association of GTP-bound Ras and Raf serine/threonine kinases has been shown by coprecipitation and affinity chromatography(24Koide H. Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These results strongly suggest that Raf is a direct target of Ras in the signal transduction of mammalian cells, although the regulatory mechanism of Raf kinase activity following the binding of Ras has not been fully understood (see (26Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) and (27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4220) Google Scholar) for reviews). On the other hand, Raf phosphorylates and subsequently activates MAP kinase kinase (MEK), the activator of MAP kinase, in various cell types. Thus, the interaction of Ras and the effector can be quantitated by measuring MEK kinase activity associated with Ras protein. Fig. 2 shows dose-dependent inhibition by the wild-type and mutant NF1-GRDs of co-immunoprecipitation of MEK kinase activity in rat brain lysate with recombinant GTPγS-bound Ras protein. In this experiment, MEK kinase activity within Ras immunoprecipitates was quantitated by incorporation of 32P into E. coli-produced kinase-negative MAP kinase as a substrate in the presence of recombinant MEK. MEK kinase activity in the immunoprecipitate of GDPβS-bound Ras as a control was almost undetectable compared to the activity associated with Ras•GTPγS, suggesting that the MEK kinase activity was precipitated through the interaction with the effector domain of Ras•GTP. Although there are several subtypes of Raf protein responsible for Ras-dependent MEK kinase activity, B-Raf seems predominant in terms of the activity in rat brain lysate ((33Moodie S.A. Paris M.J. Kolch W. Wolfman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7153-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 2, both NF201 and NF204 completely abolished the coprecipitation of MEK kinase activity at 10 nM, while the inhibitory effects were detected only at the concentrations more than 50 nM in the case of the wild-type NF1-GRD. Radioactivity incorporated into each band was quantitated, and IC50 values were calculated as 3.5 nM for NF201 and NF204, and 8 nM for the wild type, respectively, from the data of three independent experiments.Figure 2Inhibition of the association of MEK kinase activity with Ras•GTPγS by NF1-GRD mutants. The activity of MEK kinase immunoprecipitated with Ras•GTPγS or Ras•GDPβS (as a control) by anti-Ras antibody (LA069) was measured by in vitro kinase assay using GST-MAP kinase(K57D), His-MAP kinase kinase, and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. The wild-type and mutant NF1-GRDs were included during the immunoprecipitation at various concentrations. Bands corresponding to the phosphorylated GST-MAP kinase(K57D) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Association of Ras and Raf can be assessed also by Western blotting analysis following co-immunoprecipitation of Raf with Ras. We used recombinant Ha-Ras protein and the N-terminal fragment of c-Raf-1 consisting of 324 amino acids tagged with FLAG sequence (designated c-RafΔC-FH6) because the C-terminal catalytic region of c-Raf-1 protein is not required for the binding to Ras. Fig. 3 shows the inhibitory effect of NF1-GRD on the association of Ras and c-Raf-1. In this case also, the immunoprecipitate of Ras•GDPβS did not contain any detectable amount of c-RafΔC-FH6, whereas the GTPγS-bound Ras associated with the Raf fragment. At the concentration of 200 nM, both NF201 and NF204 were able to compete against the association of Ras and Raf, while the wild-type NF1-GRD could not diminish the interaction at this condition.Figure 3Inhibition of the association of c-RafΔC-FH6 with Ras•GTPγS by NF1-GRD mutants. c-RafΔC-FH6 immunoprecipitated with Ras•GTPγS, or Ras•GDPβS (as a control) by anti-Ras antibody (LA069) was measured by immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody M2. The wild-type and mutant NF1-GRDs were included during the immunoprecipitation at various concentrations. Bands corresponding to c-RafΔC-FH6 are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together with the above results, it is suggested that the affinity of the mutant NF1-GRDs toward Ras protein in its GTP-bound conformation is increased. Then, we measured the affinity between the wild-type and mutant NF1-GRDs and Ras•GTPγS by a competition assay of the GTPase-stimulating activity. Both the wild-type and mutant NF1-GRDs possess similar levels of GTPase-stimulating activity ((17Nakafuku M. Nagamine M. Ohtoshi A. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6706-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and data not shown). Suppression of the GTPase-stimulating activity occurs when excess amounts of GTPγS-bound Ras exist as competitive inhibitors against 32P-labeled Ras•GTP. As shown in Fig. 4, GTPase-stimulating activities of the mutant NF1-GRDs were decreased at lower concentrations of Ras•GTPγS compared with the wild type, indicating that the affinity of NF201 and NF204 to Ras•GTPγS was higher than that of the wild type. IC50 was calculated as 4 nM for NF201, 7 nM for NF204, and 35 nM for the wild-type NF1, respectively.Figure 4Competitive inhibition of GAP activity of NF1-GRD by Ras•GTPγS. GAP activities of the wild-type and mutant NF1-GRDs were measured by a filter binding assay using Ras•[γ-32P]GTP as a substrate. Various concentrations of Ras•GTPγS were added to the reaction as competitive inhibitors. Relative GAP activity in comparison with the value without Ras•GTPγS as 100% (wild type, ○; NF201, ▴; NF204, ▪) are shown as mean values of two or three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn a previous study(17Nakafuku M. Nagamine M. Ohtoshi A. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6706-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution can confer a strong anti-oncogenic activity specific to activated Ras protein on the NF1 gene product. Furthermore, the mutant NF1-GRDs exhibited no inhibitory effect on normal cell growth regulated by endogenous Ras proteins. In this study, we further analyzed the molecular mechanism of their anti-oncogenic action. We assumed that the mutant NF1-GRDs tightly bind to transforming Ras with higher affinity than the wild-type NF1-GRD blocking the interaction between Ras and its target molecules. In contrast, the signal transduction through endogenous normal Ras is not affected because the normal Ras is rapidly converted to an inactive GDP-bound form, to which the NF1-GRDs can no longer bind. This hypothesis is based on the following observations; 1) NF1-GRD directly binds to the effector domain of Ras, which is crucial also for association with an effector, for instance c-Raf-1; and 2) the NF1-GRD mutants suppressed the activity of transforming Ras mutants both in S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells although the direct targets of Ras are different between these organisms.First, we found that the NF1-GRDs inhibited Ras(G12V)-induced, but not PDGF receptor and endogenous normal Ras-mediated, MAP kinase phosphorylation in a transient expression system using HEK 293 cells. The results support the assumption that the mutant NF1-GRDs block the signaling by binding and sequestering oncogenic Ras because the MAP kinase cascade functions at immediate downstream of Ras. Then, we reconstituted the association of Ras and its effector, Raf, in cell-free systems and analyzed the effects of NF201 and NF204. MEK kinase activity as well as the amounts of recombinant c-RafΔC-FH6 co-immunoprecipitated with Ras•GTPγS were decreased in the presence of the mutant NF1-GRDs at lower concentrations than the wild type. Binding affinities of NF201 and NF204 to Ras calculated by a competition assay of the GAP activity were 5-9 times higher than the wild-type NF1-GRD. Initially, we attempted to measure the dissociation constants of Ras•NF1-GRD complex more directly using the purified recombinant proteins by biophysical procedures such as tryptophan fluorescent quenching. However, these attempts have not been successful.Neurofibromin has been postulated as a tumor suppressor gene product because Ras•GTP level is constitutively high in malignant Schwannoma cells from NF1 patients although Ras and GAP are functionally normal (34Basu T.N.

https://openalex.org/W1978174040,"In order to increase our knowledge about the mechanisms that regulate expression of human beta-like globin genes, we have used a novel technique to analyze the chromatin structure in living cells. This approach allowed us to detect specific DNA regions in vivo where nucleosome folding or unconstrained DNA supercoiling in erythroid cells differs from that in non-erythroid cells. In this method, we use 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (TMP) as a probe capable of detecting altered chromatin conformations. Our results show that TMP binds to DNA with a higher affinity over the regions in the locus that are actively expressed, including both the promoter and the transcribed region. This higher affinity detected when comparing erythroid cells with non-erythroid cells does not extend to other regions inside the beta-globin cluster. Our data suggest that the observed effect is likely due to nucleosome displacement. Alternatively, it could result from localized DNA supercoiling, but not from widespread torsional stress across the entire beta-like globin locus as hypothesized previously."
