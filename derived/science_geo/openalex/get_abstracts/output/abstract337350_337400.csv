https://openalex.org/W1984976112,"Intense hurricanes occurred much more frequently during the period spanning the late 1940s through the late 1960s than during the 1970s and 1980s, except for 1988 and 1989. Seasonal and multidecadal variations of intense hurricane activity are closely linked to seasonal and multidecadal variations of summer rainfall amounts in the Western Sahel region of West Africa. The multidecadal nature of West African precipitation variations and their association with variations of intense Atlantic hurricane activity can be observed in data going back nearly a century. The apparent recent breaking of the 18-year Sahel drought during 1988 and 1989 suggests that the incidence of intense hurricanes making landfall on the U.S. coast and in the Caribbean basin will likely increase during the 1990s and early years of the 21st century to levels of activity notably greater than were observed during the 1970s and 1980s."
https://openalex.org/W2002209630,"A new and sensitive differential drop solution calorimetric technique was developed for very small samples. A single experiment using one 5.18-milligram sample of perovskite, synthesized at 25 gigapascals and 1873 Kelvin, gave 110.1 ± 4.1 kilojoules per mole for the enthalpy of the ilmenite-perovskite transition in MgSiO3. The thermodynamics of the reaction of MgSiO3 (ilmenite) to MgSiO3 (perovskite) and of Mg2SiO4 (spinel) to MgSiO3 (perovskite) and MgO (periclase) were assessed. Despite uncertainties in heat capacity and molar volume at high pressure and temperature, both reactions clearly have negative pressure-temperature slopes, -0.005 ± 0.002 and -0.004 ± 0.002 gigapascals per Kelvin, respectively. The latter may be insufficiently negative to preclude whole-mantle convection."

However, if these films are very thin (of thickness in the range of tens of angstroms), they can be stabilized by long-range van der Waals forces. A simple method for making such wetting films consists of slowly drawing the fiber out of a bath of liquid; the thickness of the film is then measured using a method based on gas chromatography. If these liquid films are thick, and are forced to flow, they may then not break up: the instability becomes ""saturated."""
https://openalex.org/W1985784859,"The species-specific partnership between the sea anemone and anemone fish in many parts of the Indo-Pacific region is a well-known phenomenon. Chemicals secreted by the sea anemone to elicit symbiotic behavior of the fish have been studied for two host-guest pairs, Radianthus kuekenthali (sea anemone)-Amphiprion perideraion (anemone fish) and Stoichactis kenti-A. ocellaris. A new pyridinium compound, amphikuemin, which induces characteristic attracted swimming (toward the chemical stimulus) in A. perideraion, has been isolated from R. kuekenthali and characterized. Several other chemicals that elicit characteristic symbiotic movements have also been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2020336882,"It is now possible to start with a simple model of a solid composed of atomic cores and itinerant valence electrons and compute the total energy for a given structural arrangement of atoms with enough precision to predict the existence of new solids and their properties. The application of the model based on the pseudopotential method is described with silicon chosen as a prototype material. With only information about the constituent atoms, the electronic, structural, vibrational, and even superconducting properties of solids can be calculated from first principles. The successful predictions of superconductivity in highly condensed hexagonal silicon and the existence of new high-pressure semiconductor phases are highlighted. A discussion is presented of the use of the method to discover new stable or metastable solids at high pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2030232150,"Three ice-covered moons of Jupiter, in comparison with rocky planets and Earth's moon, produce radar echoes of astounding strengths and bizarre polarizations. Scattering from buried craters can explain these and other anomalous properties of the echoes. The role of such craters is analogous to that of the water droplets that create the apparition known as ""the glory,"" the optically bright region surrounding an observer's shadow on a cloud. Both situations involve the electromagnetic phenomenon of total internal reflection at a dielectric interface, operating in a geometry that strongly favors exact backscattering. Dim surface craters are transformed into bright glory holes by being buried under somewhat denser material, thereby increasing the intensity of their echoes by factors of hundreds. The dielectric interface thus formed at the crater walls nicely accounts for the unusual polarizations of the echoes."
https://openalex.org/W2000631882,"Several lines of evidence concerning the vertical abundance profile of water in the atmosphere of Venus lead to strikingly unusual distributions (the water vapor abundance decreases sharply in the immediately vicinity of the surface) or to serious conflicts in the profiles (different infrared bands suggest water abundances that are discrepant by a factor of 2.5 to 10). These data sets can be reconciled if (i) water molecules associate with carbon dioxide and sulfur trioxide to make gaseous carbonic acid and sulfuric acid in the lower atmosphere, and (ii) the discrepant 0.94-micrometer water measurements are due to gaseous sulfuric acid, requiring it to be a somewhat stronger absorber than water vapor inthis wavelength region. A mean total water abundance of 50 +/- 20 parts per million and a near-surface free water vapor abundance of 10 +/- 4 parts per million are derived."
https://openalex.org/W2065990539,"A newly studied interplanetary dust particle contains a unique set of minerals that closely resembles assemblages in the refractory, calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The set of minerals includes diopside, magnesium- aluminum spinel, anorthite, perovskite, and fassaite. Only fassaite has previously been identified in interplanetary dust particles. Diopside and spinel occur in complex symplectic intergrowths that may have formed by a reaction between condensed melilite and the solar nebula gas. The particle represents a new link between interplanetary dust particles and carbonaceous chondrites; however, the compositions of its two most abundant refractory phases, diopside and spinel, differ in detail from corresponding minerals in calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions."

https://openalex.org/W44423055,"Climate researchers are picking up a more or less regular 2-year beat to the global climate system - one that seems to be heard from every quarter. The most recently discovered example of this climatic ticking - and perhaps the most intriguing - comes from the very core of El Nino. Researchers have found that some aspects of this cycle of alternating warm and relatively cold waters along the equatorial Pacific have a tendency to repeat every 2 years. The overlying winds pulsate at the same pace, as do the globe-girdling effects of the El Nino cycle, from winter warmth in Alaska to heavy rains in Peru and drought in Australia. The climatic ticking in the tropical Pacific is hardly as reliable as the changing of the seasons. Sometimes it is muted, and occasionally it skips a beat. But some researchers nevertheless see hope of using it in the prediction of El Nino and its global effects. In any case, climate researchers are eager to determine what makes El Nino tick. The answer could be an underlying pacemaker of this crucial atmospheric cycle."
