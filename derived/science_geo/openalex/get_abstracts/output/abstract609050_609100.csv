Not only is this a difficult theoretical problem to solve, it is also a problem which has not hitherto been directly addressed experimentally. Here we report measurements on electron-doped calcium hexaboride (CaB6) which, we argue, show that—at a density of 7× 1019 electrons cm−3—the ground state is ferromagnetically polarized with a saturation moment of 0.07 µB per electron. Surprisingly, the magnetic ordering temperature of this itinerant ferromagnet is 600 K, of the order of the Fermi temperature of the electron gas."

https://openalex.org/W2801196856,"Background Routine Data Quality Assessments (RDQAs) were developed to measure and improve facility-level electronic medical record (EMR) data quality. We assessed if RDQAs were associated with improvements in data quality in KenyaEMR, an HIV care and treatment EMR used at 341 facilities in Kenya. Methods RDQAs assess data quality by comparing information recorded in paper records to KenyaEMR. RDQAs are conducted during a one-day site visit, where approximately 100 records are randomly selected and 24 data elements are reviewed to assess data completeness and concordance. Results are immediately provided to facility staff and action plans are developed for data quality improvement. For facilities that had received more than one RDQA (baseline and follow-up), we used generalized estimating equation models to determine if data completeness or concordance improved from the baseline to the follow-up RDQAs. Results 27 facilities received two RDQAs and were included in the analysis, with 2369 and 2355 records reviewed from baseline and follow-up RDQAs, respectively. The frequency of missing data in KenyaEMR declined from the baseline (31% missing) to the follow-up (13% missing) RDQAs. After adjusting for facility characteristics, records from follow-up RDQAs had 0.43-times the risk (95% CI: 0.32–0.58) of having at least one missing value among nine required data elements compared to records from baseline RDQAs. Using a scale with one point awarded for each of 20 data elements with concordant values in paper records and KenyaEMR, we found that data concordance improved from baseline (11.9/20) to follow-up (13.6/20) RDQAs, with the mean concordance score increasing by 1.79 (95% CI: 0.25–3.33). Conclusions This manuscript demonstrates that RDQAs can be implemented on a large scale and used to identify EMR data quality problems. RDQAs were associated with meaningful improvements in data quality and could be adapted for implementation in other settings."
https://openalex.org/W2802068887,"Objective To describe the overall sleep health of the Catalan population using data from the 2015 Catalan Health Survey and to compare the performance of two sleep health indicators: sleep duration and a 5-dimension sleep scale (SATED). Methods Multistage probability sampling representative of the non-institutionalized population aged 15 or more years, stratified by age, gender and municipality size, was used, excluding nightshift-workers. A total of 4385 surveys were included in the analyses. Associations between sleep health and the number of reported chronic diseases were assessed using non-parametric smoothed splines. Differences in the predictive ability of age-adjusted logistic regression models of self-rated health status were assessed. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess SATED determinants. Results Overall mean (SD) sleep duration was 7.18 (1.16) hours; and SATED score 7.91 (2.17) (range 0–10), lower (worse) scores were associated with increasing age and female sex. Alertness and efficiency were the most frequently impaired dimensions across age groups. SATED performed better than sleep duration when assessing self-rated health status (area under the curve = 0.856 vs. 0.798; p-value <0.001), and had a linear relationship with the number of reported chronic diseases, while the sleep duration relationship was u-shaped. Conclusions Sleep health in Catalonia is associated with age and gender. SATED has some advantaged compared to sleep duration assessment, as it relates linearly to health indicators, has a stronger association with self-rated health status, and provides a more comprehensive assessment of sleep health. Therefore, the inclusion of multi-dimensional sleep health assessment tools in national surveys should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2800822740,"Postpartum psychological functioning impacts both women’s health and outcomes in children. Lower income, ethnic minority women may be at particular risk for adverse postpartum mental health outcomes. Studies link ambient air pollution exposure with psychological dysfunction in adults although this association has not been examined among postpartum women.

Methods 
We studied associations between prenatal exposure to particulate matter with diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and postpartum psychological functioning in a lower income, ethnically mixed sample of urban US women enrolled in a pregnancy cohort study. Analyses included 557 mothers who delivered at ≥37 weeks gestation. Daily estimates of residential PM2.5 over gestation were derived using a satellite-based spatio-temporally resolved model. Outcomes included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score from 6 or 12 months postpartum and subscale scores for anhedonia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. Associations were also examined within racial/ethnic groups. Distributed lag models (DLMs) were implemented to identify windows of vulnerability during pregnancy.


Results 
Most mothers had less than a high school education (64%) and were primarily Hispanic (55%) and Black (29%). In the overall sample, a DLM adjusted for age, race, education, prenatal smoking, and season of delivery, we found significant associations between higher PM2.5 exposure in the second trimester and increased anhedonia subscale scores postpartum. In race stratified analyses, mid-pregnancy PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with increased total EPDS scores as well as higher anhedonia and depressive symptom subscale scores among Black women.


Conclusions 
Increased PM2.5 exposure in mid-pregnancy was associated with increased depressive and anhedonia symptoms, particularly in Black women."
https://openalex.org/W2801523157,"The aim of the current study was to investigate whether optimism and self-efficacy mediated the association between shyness and subjective well-being in a sample of Chinese working adults. Two hundred and eight participants completed the Revised Cheek and Buss Shyness Scale, Life Orientation Rest-Revised, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Positive and Negative Affect Scale. Structural equation modeling results showed that optimism mediated the relationship between shyness and measures of subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive and negative affect). Self-efficacy mediated the association between shyness and positive subjective well-being (life satisfaction and positive affect). These results suggest that optimism and self-efficacy play unique mediating roles in the relationship between shyness and subjective well-being. They also have important implications for the development of intervention programs aimed at promoting subjective well-being of Chinese working adults through enhancing self-efficacy and optimism."
https://openalex.org/W2800341938,"Perinatal asphyxia is an event affecting around four million newborns worldwide. The 0.5 to 2 per 1000 of full term asphyxiated newborns suffer from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), which is a frequent cause of death or severe disability and, as consequence, the most common birth injury claim for obstetrics, gynaecologists, and paediatricians. Perinatal asphyxia results from a compromised gas exchange that leads to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and metabolic acidosis. In this work, we applied a metabolomics approach to investigate the metabolic profiles of urine samples collected from full term asphyxiated newborns with HIE undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH), with the aim of identifying a pattern of metabolites associated with HIE and to follow their modifications over time. Urine samples were collected from 10 HIE newborns at birth, during hypothermia (48 hours), at the end of the therapeutic treatment (72 hours), at 1 month of life, and compared with a matched control population of 16 healthy full term newborns. The metabolic profiles were investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical methods such as principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis. Multivariate analysis indicated significant differences between the urine samples of HIE and healthy newborns at birth. The altered metabolic patterns, mainly originated from the depletion of cellular energy and homeostasis, seem to constitute a characteristic of perinatal asphyxia. The HIE urine metabolome changes over time reflected either the effects of TH and the physiological growth of the newborns. Of interest, the urine metabolic profiles of the HIE non-surviving babies, characterized by the increased excretion of lactate, resulted significantly different from the rest of HIE population."

The objective of study was to evaluate association between BMI and incident TB.The National Health Insurance database was used. Eligible participants were individuals aged 20-89 years without history of TB before 2007, and who underwent national health examinations between January 2002 and December 2006. The latest record of BMI was used as the exposure and categorized as follows: <18.5, 18.5-23, 23-25, 25-30, and ≥30 kg/m2. TB was defined as the first recorded diagnosis of TB, using ICD-10 between January 2007 and December 2013.Among 301,081 individuals, 3,772 (1.26%) incident TB cases were detected. The incidence rate of the event was 19.65 per 10,000 person-years. After adjusting age, sex, household income, smoking status, alcohol use, and diabetes, incident TB was decreased as BMI was increased in an inverse dose-response relationship. However, when stratified by age and sex, BMI >30 kg/m2 did not show protective effect of TB in female under 50 years. Additionally, BMI >30 kg/m2 did not decrease incident TB in diabetics.Our study suggests that high BMI might be associated with decreased risk of TB. However, very high BMI did not reduce the risk of TB in young females or diabetics participants with in Korean population."
https://openalex.org/W2802664853,"While dog owners ascribe different emotions to their pets, including jealousy, research on secondary emotions in nonhuman animals is very limited and, so far, only one study has investigated jealousy in dogs (Canis familiaris). This work explores jealousy in dogs one step further. We conducted two studies adapting a procedure devised to assess jealousy in human infants. In each study 36 adult dogs were exposed to a situation in which their owner and a stranger ignored them while directing positive attention towards three different objects: a book, a puppet and a fake dog (Study 1: furry; Study 2: plastic). Overall, the results of both studies do not provide evidence that the behavioral responses of our dogs were triggered by jealousy: we did not find a clear indication that the fake dogs were perceived as real social rivals, neither the furry nor the plastic one. Indeed, dogs exhibited a higher interest (i.e. look at, interact with) towards the fake dogs, but differences in the behavior towards the fake dog and the puppet only emerged in Study 2. In addition, many of the behaviors (protest, stress, attention seeking, aggression) that are considered distinctive features of jealousy were not expressed or were expressed to a limited extent, revealing that dogs did not actively try to regain their owner’s attention or interfere with the interaction between the owner and the faux rival. Finally, a differentiated response towards the attachment figure (the owner) and the unfamiliar person (the stranger) did not emerge. Differently from what reported in human infants, dogs’ behavior towards the attachment figure and the stranger interacting with the potential competitor (in this case, the fake dog) did not significantly differ: in both studies dogs paid attention to the owner and the stranger manipulating the fake dog to the same extent. In conclusion, we do not exclude that dogs could possess a rudimentary form of jealousy, but we suggest that research on this topic should require the use of a real social interloper (conspecific or human) and more naturalistic procedures."

https://openalex.org/W2801677295,"Amynodontidae is a family of Rhinocerotoidea (Mammalia, Perissodactyla) known from the late Early Eocene to the latest Oligocene, in North America and Eurasia. European Amynodontidae are very rare, and all remains belong almost exclusively to a single post—Grande Coupure genus from the Oligocene, Cadurcotherium. The “Grande Coupure” defines an extinctions and dispersal-generated originations event in Europe that is nearly contemporaneous with the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Perissodactyls are one of the major groups affected by this event: Palaeotheriidae went almost extinct during this crisis, whereas Rhinocerotidae appeared for the first time in Europe. Study of fossiliferous Eastern-European localities from this age is crucial for the understanding of this crisis. We report here three new localities of Amynodontidae in Eastern Europe. Two of them are dated from the Eocene (Morlaca, Romania; Dorog, Hungary), whereas the other is either Late Eocene or Early Oligocene (Dobârca, Romania). The skull from this latter locality belongs unexpectedly to the same individual as a previously described mandible attributed to “Cadurcodon” zimborensis. As a result, this specimen can be allocated to its proper locality, Dobârca, and is assigned to a new genus, Sellamynodon gen. nov. It is characterised by an extraordinary growth of the nuchal crest, a unique character among amynodontids. Along with this remarkable material from Dobârca, two specimens from another Romanian locality, Morlaca, have been recently discovered and are dated from the Late Eocene. They belong, as well as new material from Dorog (Middle Eocene, Hungary), to the genus Amynodontopsis, also found in North America. The new Hungarian material represents the earliest occurrence of Amynodontidae in Europe. New phylogenetic hypotheses of Rhinocerotoidea are proposed, including the new material presented here, and show that Amynodontidae may be closer to the polyphyletic family ʽHyracodontidaeʼ than to Rhinocerotidae. Amynodontidae, with their deep preorbital fossa and extremely reduced premolars, display in fact a very derived condition, compared to rhinocerotids."
https://openalex.org/W2799391618,"Sepsis is the syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from dysregulated host response to infection. Aspirin, an anti-inflammatory agent, may play a role in attenuating the inflammatory response during infection. We evaluated the association between aspirin use and long-term rates of sepsis as well as sepsis outcomes.We analyzed data from 30,239 adults ≥45 years old in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. The primary exposure was aspirin use, identified via patient interview. The primary outcome was sepsis hospitalization, defined as admission for infection with two or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. We fit Cox proportional hazards models assessing the association between aspirin use and rates of sepsis, adjusted for participant demographics, health behaviors, chronic medical conditions, medication adherence, and biomarkers. We used a propensity-matched analysis and a series of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our results. We also examined risk of organ dysfunction and hospital mortality during hospitalization for sepsis.Among 29,690 REGARDS participants with follow-up data available, 43% reported aspirin use (n = 12,869). Aspirin users had higher sepsis rates (hazard ratio 1.35; 95% CI: 1.22-1.49) but this association was attenuated following adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted HR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.88-1.12). We obtained similar results in propensity-matched and sensitivity analyses. Among sepsis hospitalizations, aspirin use was not associated with organ dysfunction or hospital death.In the REGARDS cohort, baseline aspirin use was not associated with long-term rates of sepsis."

https://openalex.org/W2802248042,"In nonlinear systems long term dynamics is governed by the attractors present in phase space. The presence of a chaotic saddle gives rise to basins of attraction with fractal boundaries and sometimes even to Wada boundaries. These two phenomena involve extreme difficulties in the prediction of the future state of the system. However, we show here that it is possible to make statistical predictions even if we do not have any previous knowledge of the initial conditions or the time series of the system until it reaches its final state. In this work, we develop a general method to make statistical predictions in systems with fractal basins. In particular, we have applied this new method to the Duffing oscillator for a choice of parameters where the system possesses the Wada property. We have computed the statistical properties of the Duffing oscillator for different phase space resolutions, to obtain information about the global dynamics of the system. The key idea is that the fraction of initial conditions that evolve towards each attractor is scale free—which we illustrate numerically. We have also shown numerically how having partial information about the initial conditions of the system does not improve in general the predictions in the Wada regions."
https://openalex.org/W2800573035,"The atom-bond connectivity index (or, for short, ABC index) is a molecular structure descriptor bridging chemistry to graph theory. It is probably the most studied topological index among all numerical parameters of a graph that characterize its topology. For a given graph G = (V, E), the ABC index of G is defined as , where di denotes the degree of the vertex i, and ij is the edge incident to the vertices i and j. A combination of physicochemical and the ABC index properties are commonly used to foresee the bioactivity of different chemical composites. Additionally, the applicability of the ABC index in chemical thermodynamics and other areas of chemistry, such as in dendrimer nanostars, benzenoid systems, fluoranthene congeners, and phenylenes is well studied in the literature. While finding of the graphs with the greatest ABC-value is a straightforward assignment, the characterization of the tree(s) with minimal ABC index is a problem largely open and has recently given rise to numerous studies and conjectures. A B1-branch of a graph is a pendent path of order 2. In this paper, we provide an important step forward to the full characterization of these minimal trees. Namely, we show that a minimal-ABC tree contains neither 4 nor 3 B1-branches. The case when the number of B1-branches is 2 is also considered."
https://openalex.org/W2803097310,"H2O2 was adopted to oxidize NO in simulated flue gas at 100-500°C. The effects of the H2O2 evaporation conditions, gas temperature, initial NO concentration, H2O2 concentration, and H2O2:NO molar ratio on the oxidation efficiency of NO were investigated. The reason for the narrow NO oxidation temperature range near 500°C was determined. The NO oxidation products were analyzed. The removal of NOx using NaOH solution at a moderate oxidation ratio was studied. It was proven that rapid evaporation of the H2O2 solution was critical to increase the NO oxidation efficiency and broaden the oxidation temperature range. the NO oxidation efficiency was above 50% at 300-500°C by contacting the outlet of the syringe needle and the stainless-steel gas pipe together to spread H2O2 solution into a thin film on the surface of the stainless-steel gas pipe, which greatly accelerated the evaporation of H2O2. The NO oxidation efficiency and the NO oxidation rate increased with increasing initial NO concentration. This method was more effective for the oxidation of NO at high concentrations. H2O2 solution with a concentration higher than 15% was more efficient in oxidizing NO. High temperatures decreased the influence of the H2O2 concentration on the NO oxidation efficiency. The oxidation efficiency of NO increased with an increase in the H2O2:NO molar ratio, but the ratio of H2O2 to oxidized NO decreased. Over 80% of the NO oxidation product was NO2, which indicated that the oxidation ratio of NO did not need to be very high. An 86.7% NO removal efficiency was obtained at an oxidation ratio of only 53.8% when combined with alkali absorption."
https://openalex.org/W2801246447,"Tumorous texture is a marker for tumor tissue inhomogeneity. Based on this assumption, this study aims to evaluate the value of computed tomography texture analysis for imaging-based prediction of perioperative complications during laparoscopic partial tumor nephrectomy.A total of 106 patients with histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma and pre-operative CT were included and volumetric texture analysis of the tumors was performed by two readers. Texture analysis parameter ratios and differences were calculated using the kidney parenchyma as reference (""reference-corrected""). Regression analysis was performed, regarding the value of the texture analysis parameters, for assessment of the tumor nuclear grade and the prediction of peri- and postoperative complications and approximated blood loss. Moreover, the inter-rater agreement in terms of the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated.Regarding the reference-corrected values, the predictive value of texture analysis parameters for severe perioperative complications was highest for the standard deviation of the mean attenuation (Area under curve/AUC, .615; sensitivity, 93.8%, specificity, 30.0%), followed by the uniformity (AUC, .599; sensitivity, 62.5%, specificity, 60.0%), and the uniformity of distribution of positive pixels (AUC, .597; sensitivity, 62.5%; specificity, 61.1%). Regarding the blood loss, the uniformity of positive pixel values (UPP; AUC, 0.638), uniformity (AUC, 0.635), and entropy (AUC, 0.633) yielded the best predictive values, whilst the tumor grade was a weaker predictor (AUC, 0.574). The applied texture analysis parameters did not correlate with the time of surgery or the warm ischemic time. All measured parameters were better predictors for complications than the tumor diameter alone. The inter-rater agreement was almost perfect (ICC, .982).CT and CT texture analysis parameters are valuable for prediction of perioperative outcome before laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in patients with renal cell carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2800224432,"Breast carcinogenesis is a multistep process accompanied by widespread molecular and genomic alterations, both in tumor and in surrounding microenvironment. It is known that tumors have altered metabolism, but the metabolic changes in normal or cancer-adjacent, nonmalignant normal tissues and how these changes relate to alterations in gene expression and histological composition are not well understood. Normal or cancer-adjacent normal breast tissues from 99 women of the Normal Breast Study (NBS) were evaluated. Data of metabolomics, gene expression and histological composition was collected by mass spectrometry, whole genome microarray, and digital image, respectively. Unsupervised clustering analysis determined metabolomics-derived subtypes. Their association with genomic and histological features, as well as other breast cancer risk factors, genomic and histological features were evaluated using logistic regression. Unsupervised clustering of metabolites resulted in two main clusters. The metabolite differences between the two clusters suggested enrichment of pathways involved in lipid metabolism, cell growth and proliferation, and migration. Compared with Cluster 1, subjects in Cluster 2 were more likely to be obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2, p<0.05), have increased adipose proportion (p<0.01) and associated with a previously defined Active genomic subtype (p<0.01). By the integrated analyses of histological, metabolomics and transcriptional data, we characterized two distinct subtypes of non-malignant breast tissue. Further research is needed to validate our findings, and understand the potential role of these alternations in breast cancer initiation, progression and recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2801290124,"Background Based on single cross-sectional data, prior research finds evidence of “transportation assimilation” among U.S. immigrants: the length of stay in the U.S. is negatively correlated with public transit use. This paper revisits this question by using repeated cross-sectional data, and examines the trend of transportation assimilation over time. Methods and results Using 1980, 1990, 2000 1% census and 2010 (1%) American Community Survey, I examine the relationship between the length of stay in the U.S. and public transit ridership among immigrants. I first run regressions separately in four data sets: I regress public transit ridership on the length of stay, controlling for other individual and geographic variables. I then compare the magnitudes of the relationship in four regressions. To study how the rate of transportation assimilation changes over time, I pool the data set and regress public transit ridership on the length of stay and its interactions with year dummies to compare the coefficients across surveys. Results confirm the conclusion of transportation assimilation: as the length of stay in the U.S. increases, an immigrant’s public transit use decreases. However, the repeated cross-section analysis suggests the assimilation rate has been decreasing in the past few decades. Conclusions This paper finds evidence of transportation assimilation: immigrants become less likely to ride public transit as the length of stay in the U.S. increases. The assimilation rate, however, has been decreasing over time. This paper finds that the rate of public transit ridership among new immigrants upon arrival, the geographic distribution of immigrants, and the changing demographics of the U.S. immigrants play roles in affecting the trend of transportation assimilation."
https://openalex.org/W2802877818,"The use of Swedish oral moist snuff, known as snus, has for a long time been limited to the Scandinavian countries. With declining cigarette sales in the western world, tobacco companies have looked to the development of alternative tobacco products. In 2006 snus products were launched in the US. Even though several studies have demonstrated negative health effects, snus is often depicted as harmless. The aim of the present study was to investigate acute vascular effects of snus as measured by arterial stiffness as well as blood pressure and heart rate.Two separate randomized double-blind crossover studies with the same study design were pooled for analysis. Twenty-nine healthy snus-users (17 females, 12 males) were included. Snus (Göteborgs Rapé) and tobacco free snus (Onico) were administered in a randomized order at two separate visits. Arterial stiffness, blood pressure and heart rate were measured at baseline as well as every five minutes for 40 minutes during exposure. Following snus removal, measurements continued for 30 minutes post exposure. Arterial stiffness was measured using pulse wave velocity (Vicorder) and pulse wave analysis (Sphygmocor).Compared to placebo, snus significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate, however, only in females (p = 0.004, p = 0.006 and p<0.001 respectively). No changes were seen in arterial stiffness measurements in either gender.We observed an increase in blood pressure and heart rate only in females, but not in males due to snus usage as compared to placebo. This novel finding was surprising and needs to be further investigated considering most of the earlier studies have mainly focused on male snus users and the increasing usage of snus among females."

This study was conducted at a non-governmental paediatric hospital and in nearby villages in Siem Reap province, Cambodia. A total of ten semi-structured interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted, involving 27 participants. Iterative data collection and analysis were performed concurrently. Data were analysed by thematic content analysis and the coding structure was developed using relevant literature. Results Participants did not have a clear understanding of what activities related to research compared with those for routine healthcare. Key attitudes towards research were responsibility and trust: personal (trust of the researcher directly) and institutional (trust of the institution as a whole). Villagers believe the village headman holds responsibility for community activities, while the village headman believes that this responsibility should be shared across all levels of the government system. Conclusions It is essential for researchers to understand the structure and relationship within the community they wish to work with in order to develop trust among community participants. This aids effective communication and understanding among all parties, enabling high quality ethical research to be conducted."

https://openalex.org/W2800808281,"Anti-community detection in networks can discover negative relations among objects. However, a few researches pay attention to detecting anti-community structure and they do not consider the node degree and most of them require high computational cost. Block models are promising methods for exploring modular regularities, but their results are highly dependent on the observed structure. In this paper, we first propose a Degree-based Block Model (DBM) for anti-community structure. DBM takes the node degree into consideration and evolves a new objective function Q(C) for evaluation. And then, a Local Expansion Optimization Algorithm (LEOA), which preferentially considers the nodes with high degree, is proposed for anti-community detection. LEOA consists of three stages: structural center detection, local anti-community expansion and group membership adjustment. Based on the formulation of DBM, we develop a synthetic benchmark DBM-Net for evaluating comparison algorithms in detecting known anti-community structures. Experiments on DBM-Net with up to 100000 nodes and 17 real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LEOA for anti-community detection in networks."
