https://openalex.org/W3022285953,"A newly described coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected over 2.3 million people, led to the death of more than 160,000 individuals and caused worldwide social and economic disruption1,2. There are no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19, nor are there any vaccines that prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2, and efforts to develop drugs and vaccines are hampered by the limited knowledge of the molecular details of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells. Here we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins that physically associated with each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins using affinity-purification mass spectrometry, identifying 332 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins. Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (of which, 29 drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 12 are in clinical trials and 28 are preclinical compounds). We screened a subset of these in multiple viral assays and found two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of mRNA translation and predicted regulators of the sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors. Further studies of these host-factor-targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat COVID-19."

Kane et al. show that the answer to that question is more complicated than particles simply settling from where they are found on the sea surface (see the Perspective by Mohrig). Using data that they collected off the coast of Corsica, the authors show that thermohaline-driven currents can control the distribution of microplastics by creating hotspots of accumulation, analogous to their role in causing focused areas of seafloor sediment deposition. Such currents also supply oxygen and nutrients to deep-sea benthos, so deepsea biodiversity hotspots are also likely to be microplastic hotspots. Science , this issue p. 1140 ; see also p. 1055"
https://openalex.org/W3016048690,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has highlighted the need for antiviral approaches that can target emerging viruses with no effective vaccines or pharmaceuticals. Here, we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade RNA from SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2. This approach effectively reduced H1N1 IAV load in respiratory epithelial cells. Our bioinformatic analysis showed that a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. With the development of a safe and effective system for respiratory tract delivery, PAC-MAN has the potential to become an important pan-coronavirus inhibition strategy."

Han et al. leveraged both of these strategies to develop a gelatin-based ionic thermoelectric device that uses alkali salts and an iron-based redox couple to generate a large thermopower. This device is capable of generating useful amounts of energy from body heat. Science , this issue p. 1091"

C. Wang et al. developed a new ceramic-sintering technique that uses resistive heating of thin carbon strips to ramp up and ramp down temperature quickly. This method allows for the quick synthesis of a wide variety of ceramics while mitigating the loss of volatile elements. Ultrafast sintering is ideal for synthesizing many compositions to screen for ideal properties for a variety of applications, including the development of new solid-state electrolytes.

Smith et al. estimated grounded and floating ice mass change for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets from 2003 to 2019 using satellite laser altimetry data from NASA's ICESat and ICESat-2 satellites. They show how changing ice flow, melting, and precipitation affect different regions of ice and estimate that grounded-ice loss averaged close to 320 gigatons per year over that period and contributed 14 millimeters to sea level rise.

https://openalex.org/W3021896152,"A water boost for methanol synthesis Model catalysts based on metals and metal oxides can dissociate methane (CH 4 ) at room temperature, converting it directly to methanol (CH 3 OH). Liu et al. show that for one of these catalysts, an “inverted” CeO x -Cu 2 O oxide on Cu(111), water tunes the selectivity from forming CO and CO 2 to forming surface CH 3 O groups, as revealed by ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Theoretical modeling showed that adsorbed water blocks O 2 dissociation and O 2 instead oxidizes the reduced catalyst. Hydroxyl groups from water generate the CH 3 O species from dissociated CH 4 , and water then goes on to form and displace CH 3 OH to the gas phase. Science , this issue p. 513"
https://openalex.org/W3021988909,"Androgen deprivation is the cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment. It results in involution of the normal gland to ~90% of its original size because of the loss of luminal cells. The prostate regenerates when androgen is restored, a process postulated to involve stem cells. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a rare luminal population in the mouse prostate that expresses stemlike genes (Sca1+ and Psca+) and a large population of differentiated cells (Nkx3.1+, Pbsn+). In organoids and in mice, both populations contribute equally to prostate regeneration, partly through androgen-driven expression of growth factors (Nrg2, Rspo3) by mesenchymal cells acting in a paracrine fashion on luminal cells. Analysis of human prostate tissue revealed similar differentiated and stemlike luminal subpopulations that likewise acquire enhanced regenerative potential after androgen ablation. We propose that prostate regeneration is driven by nearly all persisting luminal cells, not just by rare stem cells."

Similar activity on other stars may determine the habitability of any orbiting exoplanets. Reinhold et al. analyzed brightness variations of stars observed with the Kepler and Gaia space telescopes to infer their activity levels (see the Perspective by Santos and Mathur). They found that the Sun was less active than most of the 369 solar-type stars in their sample (those with the most similar physical properties). It remains unclear whether the Sun is permanently less active than other stars of its type or if its activity levels vary over many thousands or millions of years.

Non-ionizing and transparent to most fabrics, it is finding application in security screening and imaging but is also being developed for communication and chemical sensing. To date, most THz detectors have focused just on signal intensity, an effort that discards half the signal in terms of the full optical state, including polarization. Peng et al. developed a THz detector based on crossed nanowires (arranged in a hash structure) that is capable of resolving the full state of the THz light. The approach provides a nanophotonic platform for the further development of THz-based technologies. Science , this issue p. 510"
https://openalex.org/W3022206095,"IL-13 hits the gym Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a cytokine secreted by T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), and granulocytes. It acts as a central mediator in allergy and antihelminth defense with various effects. Knudsen et al. report a distinct role for IL-13 in exercise and metabolism (see the Perspective by Correia and Ruas). Mice subjected to endurance training showed increases in circulating IL-13, which correlated with ILC2 expansion in the muscles. By contrast, exercise-induced increases in muscle fatty acid utilization and mitochondrial biogenesis were erased when mice lacked IL-13. Activation of signaling pathways downstream of the muscle IL-13 receptor was key to this effect. Intramuscular injection of adenoviral IL-13 could recapitulate exercise-induced metabolic reprogramming. This signaling pathway may have evolved to combat the metabolic stresses of parasite infection. Science , this issue p. eaat3987 ; see also p. 470"
https://openalex.org/W3022183975,"Retinal ganglion cells that release GABA Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) communicate light signals from the retina to the brain and were previously considered to signal exclusively through release of excitatory neurotransmitters. There have been earlier hints of RGCs producing the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but the specific cells have never been identified and their function was entirely unknown. Sonoda et al. found that a subpopulation of intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs) releases GABA (see the Perspective by Ding and Wei). Removal of GABA signaling from ipRGCs led to an increased light sensitivity of the pupillary light reflex and of circadian photoentrainment. GABA release thus moved the dynamic range of these non–image-forming behaviors to bright light intensities. These results explain why these behaviors are so much less sensitive to environmental lighting conditions than conscious visual perception. Science , this issue p. 527 ; see also p. 471"

It is an open question whether a topological material that is also a superconductor can support an edge current that consists of paired excitations. W. Wang et al. studied the Weyl superconductor molybdenum ditelluride and, using systematic transport measurements in the presence of a magnetic field, revealed the signatures of an edge supercurrent.

https://openalex.org/W3023150734,"Heat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses that impair plant growth and crop productivity. Plant growth-promoting endophytic bacteria (PGPEB) and humic acid (HA) are used as bio-stimulants and ecofriendly approaches to improve agriculture crop production and counteract the negative effects of heat stress. Current study aimed to analyze the effect of thermotolerant SA1 an isolate of Bacillus cereus and HA on tomato seedlings. The results showed that combine application of SA1+HA significantly improved the biomass and chlorophyll fluorescence of tomato plants under normal and heat stress conditions. Heat stress increased abscisic acid (ABA) and reduced salicylic acid (SA) content; however, combined application of SA1+HA markedly reduced ABA and increased SA. Antioxidant enzymes activities revealed that SA1 and HA treated plants exhibited increased levels of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH). In addition, heat stress markedly reduced the amino acid contents; however, the amino acids were increased with co-application of SA1+HA. Similarly, inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry results showed that plants treated with SA1+HA exhibited significantly higher iron (Fe+), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K+) uptake during heat stress. Heat stress increased the relative expression of SlWRKY33b and autophagy-related (SlATG5) genes, whereas co-application of SA1+HA augmented the heat stress response and reduced SlWRKY33b and SlATG5 expression. The heat stress-responsive transcription factor (SlHsfA1a) and high-affinity potassium transporter (SlHKT1) were upregulated in SA1+HA-treated plants. In conclusion, current findings suggest that co-application with SA1+HA can be used for the mitigation of heat stress damage in tomato plants and can be commercialized as a biofertilizer."
https://openalex.org/W3022535660,"Background Technological advances in remote monitoring offer new opportunities to quantify body weight patterns in free-living populations. This paper describes body weight fluctuation patterns in response to weekly, holiday (Christmas) and seasonal time periods in a large group of individuals engaged in a weight loss maintenance intervention. Methods Data was collected as part The NoHoW Project which was a pan-European weight loss maintenance trial. Three eligible groups were defined for weekly, holiday and seasonal analyses, resulting in inclusion of 1,421, 1,062 and 1,242 participants, respectively. Relative weight patterns were modelled on a time series following removal of trends and grouped by gender, country, BMI and age. Results Within-week fluctuations of 0.35% were observed, characterised by weekend weight gain and weekday reduction which differed between all groups. Over the Christmas period, weight increased by a mean 1.35% and was not fully compensated for in following months, with some differences between countries observed. Seasonal patterns were primarily characterised by the effect of Christmas weight gain and generally not different between groups. Conclusions This evidence may improve current understanding of regular body weight fluctuation patterns and help target future weight management interventions towards periods, and in groups, where weight gain is anticipated."
https://openalex.org/W3023129297,"Introduced about a century ago, suramin remains a frontline drug for the management of early-stage East African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Cellular entry into the causative agent, the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, occurs through receptor-mediated endocytosis involving the parasite's invariant surface glycoprotein 75 (ISG75), followed by transport into the cytosol via a lysosomal transporter. The molecular basis of the trypanocidal activity of suramin remains unclear, but some evidence suggests broad, but specific, impacts on trypanosome metabolism (i.e. polypharmacology). Here we observed that suramin is rapidly accumulated in trypanosome cells proportionally to ISG75 abundance. Although we found little evidence that suramin disrupts glycolytic or glycosomal pathways, we noted increased mitochondrial ATP production, but a net decrease in cellular ATP levels. Metabolomics highlighted additional impacts on mitochondrial metabolism, including partial Krebs' cycle activation and significant accumulation of pyruvate, corroborated by increased expression of mitochondrial enzymes and transporters. Significantly, the vast majority of suramin-induced proteins were normally more abundant in the insect forms compared with the blood stage of the parasite, including several proteins associated with differentiation. We conclude that suramin has multiple and complex effects on trypanosomes, but unexpectedly partially activates mitochondrial ATP-generating activity. We propose that despite apparent compensatory mechanisms in drug-challenged cells, the suramin-induced collapse of cellular ATP ultimately leads to trypanosome cell death."
https://openalex.org/W3023995809,"The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of B-Mode ultrasound and Hepatorenal Index (HRI) by high-end devices for the detection and classification of hepatic steatosis in patients with various causes of chronic liver disease (CLD).We retrospectively enrolled patients with CLD who underwent liver biopsy and baseline ultrasound between March 2016 and May 2019. Sonographic graduation of steatosis (0°-III°) using B-Mode criteria and HRI were correlated with the histological graduation (S0 (<5% fat), S1 (≥5-33%), S2 (>33-66%) and S3 (>66%). Interobserver agreement was calculated.157 patients were evaluated. B-Mode ultrasound had a sensitivity of 75.6% and a specificity of 76.0% to differentiate between steatosis and no steatosis (AUROC 0.758). Using B-Mode criteria for advanced steatosis (≥II°), specificity for presence of histological steatosis was ≥98.7%. For detection of advanced steatosis (≥S2), sensitivity of B-mode criteria was 90.9%. In a subgroup of patients with advanced liver fibrosis, sensitivity of B-mode criteria was 95.0% for detection of advanced steatosis (S≥2). A HRI cut-off-value of 1.46 differentiates between patients with steatosis and patients without steatosis with a sensitivity of 42.7% and a specificity of 90.7% (AUROC 0.680). Interobserver agreement of both B-Mode and HRI was good to excellent.B-Mode ultrasound using high-end devices is an excellent method to detect advanced steatosis in patients with various CLD. For diagnosis of mild steatosis, modern ultrasound devices may have higher sensitivity but at the expense of specificity. Stage of fibrosis and etiology of CLD seem not to impact on diagnostic accuracy. The additional calculation of HRI seems to have no additional benefit with regard to detect or grade hepatic steatosis in our study population."
https://openalex.org/W3103743850,"The cuprate high-temperature superconductors (HTSC) have been the subject of intense study for more than 30 years with no consensus yet on the underlying mechanism of the superconductivity. Conventional wisdom dictates that the mysterious and extraordinary properties of the cuprates arise from doping a strongly correlated antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator (1,2). The highly overdoped cuprates$-$those beyond the dome of superconductivity (SC)--are considered to be conventional Fermi liquid metals (3). Here, we report the emergence of itinerant ferromagnetic order (FM) below 4K for doping beyond the SC dome in electron-doped La$_{2-x} $Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (LCCO). The existence of this FM order is evidenced by negative, anisotopic and hysteretic magnetoresistance, hysteretic magnetization, and the polar Kerr effect, all of which are standard signatures of itinerant FM in metals (4,5). This surprising new result suggests that the overdoped cuprates are also influenced by electron correlations and the physics is much richer than that of a conventional Fermi liquid metal."
https://openalex.org/W3022305939,"Noroviruses are the main causative agents of acute viral gastroenteritis, but the host factors that restrict their replication remain poorly identified. Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are interferon (IFN)-inducible GTPases that exert broad antiviral activity and are important mediators of host defenses against viral infections. Here, we show that both IFN-γ stimulation and murine norovirus (MNV) infection induce GBP2 expression in murine macrophages. Results from loss- and gain-of-function assays indicated that GBP2 is important for IFN-γ-dependent anti-MNV activity in murine macrophages. Ectopic expression of MNV receptor (CD300lf) in human HEK293T epithelial cells conferred susceptibility to MNV infection. Importantly, GBP2 potently inhibited MNV in these human epithelial cells. Results from mechanistic dissection experiments revealed that the N-terminal G domain of GBP2 mediates these anti-MNV effects. R48A and K51A substitutions in GBP2, associated with loss of GBP2 GTPase activity, attenuated the anti-MNV effects of GBP2. Finally, we found that nonstructural protein 7 (NS7) of MNV co-localizes with GBP2 and antagonizes the anti-MNV activity of GBP2. These findings reveal that GBP2 is an important mediator of host defenses against murine norovirus."
https://openalex.org/W3022149327,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in posttranscriptional regulation and may serve as targets for the diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of miRNAs profiles in gastric cancer progression is still lacking. Here, we report that miR-129-5p is downregulated in gastric cancer by analyzing TCGA database (n = 41) and clinical tumor samples (n = 60). MiR-129-5p transfection suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation through inducing G1 phase arrest in vitro and inhibit xenograft tumor growth in vivo. MiR-129-5p directly targeted the 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTR) of HOXC10 mRNA and downregulated its expression. Importantly, miR-129-5p could reverse the oncogenic effect induced by HOXC10. We systemically screened the downstream target of HOXC10 by ChIP sequencing, and found that HOXC10 could transcriptionally regulate the expression of Cyclin D1 and facilitate G1/S cell cycle transition. Notably, high levels of HOXC10 and Cyclin D1 were related with poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients (n = 90). These findings reveal a novel role of miR-129-5p/HOXC10/Cyclin D1 axis in modulating cell cycle and gastric tumorigenesis, which might provide potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for gastric cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3021957857,"Background A global epidemic of obesity has been documented, particularly among African countries. While central obesity and overweight have been reported for many countries, very limited information exists about the prevalence of these health problems in Sudan, and these data are nonexistent for Eastern Sudan. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of obesity and central obesity, as well as the factors associated with both, among adults in Gadarif, Eastern Sudan. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Gadarif, Eastern Sudan, during the period of January through May 2018. Sociodemographic and health characteristics data were collected through a questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were measured using the standard methods. Both descriptive and inferential statics were applied to analyze the data. Results A total of 594 adults participated in the study; 70.4% of them were female. The mean (standard deviation) age was 44.98 (16.64) years. Of the 594 enrolled participants, 33.7%, 7.4%, 26.8%, and 32.2% were normal weight, underweight, overweight, and obese, respectively. The prevalence of central obesity was (67.8%). Approximately, one-third of the participants (29.29%) were obese and had central obesity. In the multinomial regression, being married was the main risk factor associated with overweight, and older age, female sex, being married and hypertension were significantly associated with obesity. In the binary regression, the main risk factors associated with central obesity were female sex and being married. Conclusion The prevalence rates of both obesity and central obesity among the study participants were high. Older age and hypertension were only associated with obesity. Obesity and central obesity were significantly associated with female sex and being married. This study provided valuable baseline information to develop appropriate strategies for the prevention and control of obesity in Eastern Sudan."
https://openalex.org/W3023741141,"Testing the chiral anomaly Pi mesons, also known as pions, consist of a quark and an antiquark and are extremely unstable. Neutral pions have a lifetime of only ∼80 attoseconds, decaying into two photons. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of quarks and gluons, predicts this decay and the associated lifetime using the mechanism of broken chiral symmetry—the so-called chiral anomaly. Measuring the lifetime to high precision then provides a benchmark for theories that aim to improve on this original prediction. Larin et al. measured this lifetime with an uncertainty that was half that of the previous most precise result (see the Perspective by Meyer). The measured value was consistent with the original QCD prediction and less consistent with other theoretical approaches. Science , this issue p. 506 ; see also p. 469"
https://openalex.org/W3020907394,"Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common condition, often associated with high maternal and fetal morbidity. The use of new tools for early GDM screening can contribute to metabolic control to reduce maternal and fetal risk. This study aimed to ascertain whether maternal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) measurement by ultrasound during the first half of pregnancy can predict the occurrence of GDM during the third trimester. Methods A prospective cohort study of 133 pregnant women with gestational age ≤20 weeks in an outpatient setting. VAT depth was measured by ultrasound at the maternal periumbilical region. GDM status was obtained through hospital charts during hospitalization to delivery. A Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimum threshold to predict GDM. Results According to the ROC curve, a 45mm threshold was identified as the best cut-off value, with 66% of accuracy to predict GDM. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) for GDM were 13.4 (95%CI 2.9–61.1) and 8.9 (95%CI 1.9–42.2), respectively. A similar result was obtained among pre-gravid non-obese women, with crude and adjusted OR of 16.6 (95%CI 1.9–142.6) and 14.4 (95%CI 1.7–125.7), respectively. Among pre-gravid obese patients, a 45mm threshold did not reach statistical significance to predict GDM. Conclusion The high and significant OR found before and after adjustments provides additional evidence of a strong association between VAT and GDM. It appears that VAT measurement during the first half of pregnancy has great potential in identifying non-obese women at high risk for GDM. This evidence can assist obstetricians in correctly allocating resources among populations of pregnant women at risk, determined not only by pre-gravid body mass index (BMI)."
https://openalex.org/W3021367274,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) modulates gene expression by interacting with chromatin regions that are frequently distal from the promoters of estrogen-regulated genes. Active chromatin-enriched “super-enhancer” (SE) regions, mainly observed in in vitro culture systems, often control production of key cell type–determining transcription factors. Here, we defined super-enhancers that bind to ERα in vivo within hormone-responsive uterine tissue in mice. We found that SEs are already formed prior to estrogen exposure at the onset of puberty. The genes at SEs encoded critical developmental factors, including retinoic acid receptor α (RARA) and homeobox D (HOXD). Using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) along with DNA sequence analysis, we demonstrate that most SEs are located at a chromatin loop end and that most uterine genes in loop ends associated with these SEs are regulated by estrogen. Although the SEs were formed before puberty, SE-associated genes acquired optimal ERα-dependent expression after reproductive maturity, indicating that pubertal processes that occur after SE assembly and ERα binding are needed for gene responses. Genes associated with these SEs affected key estrogen-mediated uterine functions, including transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and LIF interleukin-6 family cytokine (LIF) signaling pathways.

In mice, prior to production of ovarian hormones, which begins with the onset of estrus cyclicity at puberty (postnatal day 28), the prepubertal uterus is hypoplastic, has ERα in all cells, and exhibits rapid transcriptional and growth responses of all uterine cell types to exogenous estradiol (E2) (15Binder A.K.

The molecular details of this important process have not been explored; therefore, we sought to define the estrogen-dependent enhancer landscape of the developing mouse uterus by analyzing uterine chromatin isolated from prepubertal (21-day-old) or from adult (10-week-old) mice that were ovariectomized (ovexed) to remove the source of endogenous E2 and then treated for 1 h with vehicle (V) or with E2 to gain insights into molecular components and responses impacted during development of a hormonally regulated tissue. We defined super-enhancers (SEs) that bind ERα-in prepubertal uterine samples from mice treated for 1 h with vehicle (V) or with E2, as well as in uterine samples from ovexed adult mice treated for 1 h with V or E2 as described under “Experimental procedures.” Briefly, ERα-binding enhancers were identified using ERα ChIP-Seq data by stitching together regions with more than one ERα peak within 12,500 bp in at least one of the samples. The 4634 enhancer stretches containing multiple ERα-binding sites were then classified as “typical” or “super” enhancers (TEs or SEs, respectively) by plotting ranked H3K27Ac signal of each; enhancers beyond the slope = 1 elbow of the curve (Fig. 1A) were considered SEs. Therefore, locations of ERα ChIP-Seq peaks from all four sample types were either classified as single peaks (Fig. 1B) or were within enhancer regions with multiple peaks (Fig. 1B). The multipeak enhancer regions were then classified as super-enhancers or typical enhancers (Fig. 1B). Several hundred SEs were identified in each sample type (Fig. 1A). Comparison of the enhancers called in each sample indicates that many SEs overlap across the sample types (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2), and most that are SEs, but not in all samples, are ranked in the top 25% of enhancers (Fig. 1A, red lines in the heatmap below each curve). The SEs in the prepubertal V-treated mice are present before the cells have been exposed to ovarian E2 beginning at puberty, whereas the SEs in the ovexed adult samples represent super-enhancers after the uterus has undergone pubertal maturation. For each super-enhancer curve, genes located at the top 10 SEs are listed. We noted that three of the genes at the SEs (Zmiz1, Ncor2, and Rara) were among the 10 highest ranked in all samples (Fig. 1C). Comparison of the SEs using heatmaps of ERα and H3K27Ac ChIP-Seq signals centered on each of the 2431 ERα-binding sites that is within a SE in at least one of the four samples (Fig. 2) indicates that the H3K27Ac signal intensities of the adult and the 21-day-old are similar in V- and E2-treated samples, respectively, showing that the SEs seen in prepubertal samples, prior to pubertal uterine development, are largely unchanged by pubertal development. E2 leads to increased ERα binding at each site, as well as increased H3K27Ac signal flanking SE ERα-binding locations. Interestingly, although E2 also increases ERα binding at the 21,894 non-SE ERα-binding sites (TE and single ERα-binding sites), H3K27Ac signal is more static (Fig. 2), with only the highest ranked ERα binding sites exhibiting E2-dependent H3K27Ac signal increase. Some researchers use H3K4Me1 ChIP-Seq signal intensity, also associated with active enhancers, to classify SEs. Using H3K4Me1 signal to classify uterine enhancers revealed that 65–87% of SEs by H3K4Me1 were also classified as SEs using H3K27Ac (Table S1). Additionally, >98% of SEs by H3K4Me1 signal were within the top quartile of the H3K27Ac signal. Locations of SEs called using H3K27Ac in the adult ovexed 1-h E2 uterus relative to genes and chromosomes are illustrated in Fig. S1.Figure 2Estrogen increases ERα and H3K27Ac enrichment at super-enhancers. Shown is a heatmap of ERα ChIP-Seq and H3K27Ac ChIP-Seq signal centered on 2431 ERα peaks that are at super-enhancers (top) or 21,894 ERα peaks that are not at super-enhancers but are at typical enhancers or are single ERα-binding sites (bottom) in uterine chromatin samples from adult ovexed or 21-day-old female mice treated with saline V or with E2 for 1 h. For each set, enhancers are in the order of ERα signal in the adult E2 sample. Each panel shows ChIP-Seq signal at ±1 kb relative to the ERα peak midpoint, with signal depth-normalized to 20 million uniquely mapped nonduplicate reads/sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Distal enhancers can exert transcriptional control by physically contacting gene promoters through “looping” mechanisms (10Rowley M.J. Corces V.G. Organizational principles of 3D genome architecture.Nat. Rev. 2018; 19 (30367165): 789-80010.1038/s41576-018-0060-8Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It is not known whether contacts are dynamically formed in order to exert regulatory signals between distal enhancers and promoters, whether loops are preformed and the activity of the promoters is mediated via dynamic transcription factor interactions, or whether a combination of mechanisms occurs (20Le Dily F. Beato M. Signaling by steroid hormones in the 3D nuclear space.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19 (29360755): E30610.3390/ijms19020306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Assigning ERα-interacting regions to regulated genes is important for understanding how ERα binding to distal enhancers regulates gene promoters; therefore, we analyzed ovariectomized adult mouse uterus 1 h after treatment with V, E2, or progesterone (P4) using Hi-C. We used the Juicer tool to call loops from the Hi-C data of each treatment as well as differential loops in pairwise comparisons (Fig. 3A). We observed little variability between replicates or between different treatments, suggesting that loops are not altered globally by the hormone treatments we administered (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we combined the loops from all WT samples into an “atlas” of uterine loops. Then we used cohesin subunit SMC1a ChIP-Seq to assess interactions and potential impacts of hormone treatment. Because cohesin slides along chromatin until it contacts a pair of converging CTCF sites (10Rowley M.J. Corces V.G. Organizational principles of 3D genome architecture.Nat.

We examined SMC1A signal intensity, both at selected loop anchors and at other locations, and compared V– and E2–treated samples (Fig. 3B). When we compared V versus E2 SMC1a signal intensity, we did not observe a notable impact of E2 treatment (Fig. 3B) at selected loop anchors or at other locations, suggesting once again that loops are preformed and not impacted by our hormone treatments. To assess whether specific transcription factors might be associated with V versus E2 loops, we analyzed the DNA motifs associated with SMC1a peaks that were located at both ends of loops. The CTCF motif is highly enriched in SMC1a peaks at loop anchors of both V and E2 samples (Table 1). The ERα motif estrogen response element and ERα “tethering” factor motif SP1 are both selectively enriched at SMC1a peaks of the E2 sample. These observations suggest E2-induced mechanisms in which ERα and associated transcription factors such as SP1 interact with preformed chromatin loops. Consistent with this mechanism, we note that Hi-C analysis of uterine tissue from mice lacking ERα shows that loops are present and do not differ from WT samples any more than the variation observed between replicates (Fig. 3A).Table 1HOMER analysis showing de novo motifs in SMC1a peaks that overlap with anchors of loops with SMC1a at both ends (Fig. 3B) in V-treated (top) or E2-treated (bottom) samplesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Next, we evaluated the relationships between SEs and chromatin loops and whether SE and uterine genes are brought into proximity in 3D space. For this part of our analysis, we focused on the adult ovexed E2-treated samples. First, we examined average H3K27Ac signal per loop at all loop ends or “anchors” (Fig. 4A), which indicated that this histone modification was centered on the ends of loops. By further comparing loop anchors overlapping TEs versus SEs, we observed significantly more H3K27Ac signal at TE-associated loop anchors than at all loop anchors (p < 0.0001; Fig. 4A). Signal was further enriched at SE-associated loop anchors relative to all or to TE-associated loop anchors (p < 0.0001), reflecting the more robust enhancer activity and confirming these regions as SEs. Of the 281 SEs identified in adult E2-treated tissue, 94% (263 SEs) were at the end of a loop, suggesting that they were likely to contact genes in distal regions (Fig. 4B). To get an indication of the gene regulation that might occur by looping between genes and SEs, we selected genes that either were at one of the SEs in a loop end or were at the other end of a loop that formed from a SE. Altogether, we found this entailed 1600 genes (Fig. 4C). Our previous studies have indicated that ERα interaction with chromatin occurs within 1 h and that resulting gene regulation occurs subsequently (9Hewitt S.C. Li L. Grimm S.A. Chen Y. Liu L. Li Y.

Therefore, we used RNA-Seq of uterine RNA from ovariectomized mice treated with V or treated with E2 for 2 or 6 h to determine whether these 1600 ERα-binding SE-associated genes were transcribed and E2-regulated in the uterus. Indeed, 963 of these 1600 SE-associated genes are expressed (transcripts per million (TPM) ≥ 1 in at least one treatment condition) in uterine cells (Fig. 4C). Overall, 9975 uterine genes are regulated by E2 (TPM ≥ 1, adjusted p value <0.01) in at least one treatment condition (Table S2). 569 of the 963 uterine SE-associated genes are regulated by estrogen (Fig. 4D and Table S3). This suggests that ERα-binding SEs may be involved in regulation of 5–6% of E2-responsive uterine genes. The remaining E2-regulated uterine genes are likely to be mediated by ERα interactions at TE or at single ERα-binding sites, as we have previously demonstrated that the ERα is required for uterine E2 genomic response (4Hewitt S.C.

The most prevalent disease-linked mutation is the I1061T variant of NPC1, which exhibits defective folding and trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the LE/Ly compartments. We now show that the FDA-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA) corrects the folding and trafficking defect associated with I1061T-NPC1 leading to restoration of cholesterol homeostasis, an effect that is largely driven by a reduction in HDAC7 expression. The VPA-mediated trafficking correction is in part associated with an increase in the acetylation of lysine residues in the cysteine-rich domain of NPC1. The HDACi-mediated correction is synergistically improved by combining it with the FDA-approved anti-malarial, chloroquine, a known lysosomotropic compound, which improved the stability of the LE/Ly-localized fraction of the I1061T variant. We posit that combining the activity of VPA, to modulate epigenetically the cellular acetylome, with chloroquine, to alter the lysosomal environment to favor stability of the trafficked I1061T variant protein can have a significant therapeutic benefit in patients carrying at least one copy of the I1061T variant of NPC1, the most common disease-associated mutation leading to NPC disease. Given its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, we posit VPA provides a potential mechanism to improve the response to 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, by restoring a functional NPC1 to the cholesterol managing compartment as an adjunct therapy.

https://openalex.org/W3022515652,"Chile has one of the highest life expectancies at 60 years in South America. This study was aimed to determine healthy life expectancies among Chilean older people, according to self-rated health and disability, and to explore gender differences.Data from the National Survey of Health (2009 and 2016) were used to estimate prevalence of less than good self-rated health and disability among people aged 60 years and above. Health expectancies were calculated with the Sullivan method.In both years, women expected to live a lower proportion of their life expectancy in good self-rated health (54.5% [95% CI 50.0-58.8] for men and 37.6% [95% CI 34.3-40.8] for women in 2009; 46.1% [95% CI 42.6-49.7] for men and 38.5% [95% CI 35.6-41.4] for women in 2016). Life expectancy in less than good self-rated health increased for men (9.4 years [95% CI 8.4-10.3] in 2009; 11.5 years [95% CI 10.7-12.2]). Women expected to live a lower proportion of their remaining life without disabilities (65.3% [95% CI 61.2-69.4] for men and 44.9% [95% CI 41.9-47.9] for women in 2009; 71.9% [95% CI 68.7-75.0] for men and 61.1% [95% CI 58.5-63.8] for women in 2016). In 2016, disability-free life expectancy increased among women, but they still had a higher life expectancy with mild disability (2.8 years [95% CI 2.3-3.4] for men and 6.0 years [95% CI 5.4-6.7] for women).Women expected to spend more years in less than good self-rated health and disabled. There was an expansion of life expectancy in less than good SRH among men and a compression of disability in both sexes. The high proportion of years expected to be lived in less than good self-rated health and gender differences in disability-free life expectancy of older adults should be addressed by public health policies in Chile."
https://openalex.org/W3023268610,"Thyroid hormones are essential for the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic processes. However, the relationship between thyroid function and host gut microbial communities is not properly understood. To determine whether and how gut microbiota is associated with thyroid function, metagenomics analysis of the bacterial population in fecal samples of rat models of hyperthyroidism (induced by levothyroxine) and hypothyroidism (induced by propylthiouracil or thyroidectomy) was conducted through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results revealed that all thyroid dysfunction models were definitely established and gut microbial composition varied according to different thyroid functional status. The relative abundance of Ruminococcus was significantly higher in the hyperthyroidism group (HE) vs both the normal and hypothyroidism groups (HO) while S24-7 was significantly higher in the HO group. The population of Prevotellaceae and Prevotella were significantly lower in the HO group vs the normal. Firmicutes and Oscillospira were significantly higher in the SHO (surgery-induced hypothyroidism) group, while Prevotellaceae and Prevotella showed lower abundance in the SHO group than the SHAM group. Present results suggest that thyroid functions may have the potential to influence the profile of gut microbiota and could be used as foundation to investigate interaction mechanism between thyroid and gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W3022019756,"Since its emergence in the early 2000s, livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clonal complex 398 (LA-MRSA CC398) has led to an increasing number of human infections in Denmark and other European countries with industrial pig production. LA-MRSA CC398 is primarily associated with skin infections among pig farm workers but is also increasingly recognized as a cause of life-threatening disease among elderly and immunocompromised people. Pig farm workers may serve as vehicles for the spread of LA-MRSA CC398 and other farm-origin bacteria between farms and into the general population. Yet, little is known about the bacterial community dynamics in pig farm workers and other persons with long- and short-term exposure to the pig farm environment. To gain insight into this, we investigated the nasal microbiomes in pig farm workers during a workweek on four LA-MRSA CC398-positive pig farms, as well as in short-term visitors two hours before, immediately after, and 48 hours after a 1-hour visit to another LA-MRSA CC398-positive pig farm. S. aureus and LA-MRSA CC398 carriage was quantified by means of culture, and the composition of the bacterial communities was investigated through sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Pig farm workers often carried LA-MRSA CC398 and other bacteria from the pig farm environment, both at work and at home, although at lower levels at home. In contrast, short-term visitors were subject to a less dramatic and rapidly reversible change in the nasal bacterial community composition. These results suggest that pig farm workers may be an important source of LA-MRSA CC398 and perhaps other pathogens of human and veterinary relevance."

In this report, using an Mtm1−/y disease model, we found that expression of the intragenic microRNA miR-199a-1 is up-regulated along with that of its host gene, dynamin 2 (Dnm2), in XLCNM skeletal muscle. To assess the role of miR-199a-1 in XLCNM, we crossed miR-199a-1−/− with Mtm1−/y mice and found that the resultant miR-199a-1-Mtm1 double-knockout mice display markers of improved health, as evidenced by lifespans prolonged by 30% and improved muscle strength and histology. Mechanistic analyses showed that miR-199a-1 directly targets nonmuscle myosin IIA (NM IIA) expression and, hence, inhibits muscle postnatal development as well as muscle maturation. Further analysis revealed that increased expression and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) up-regulates Dnm2/miR-199a-1 expression in XLCNM muscle.

Centronuclear myopathies (CNMs) are a series of fatal muscle diseases with muscular pathology characterized by atrophic muscle fibers, disordered sarcomere organization, and a large number of centronuclear myofibers (1Tasfaout H.

CNMs are caused by mutations in several genes, including myotubularin 1 (MTM1), dynamin 2 (DNM2), bridging integrator-1 (BIN1), ryanodine receptor (RYR1), and titin (TTN). Among these genes, MTM1 serves as a lipid phosphatase to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, which are essential for membrane formation/trafficking, endocytosis, and endosome formation (3Cowling B.S.

To address the model that miR-199a is a contributor to XLCNM, we used a mouse model with deletion of the Mtm1 gene (Mtm1−/y) as an XLCNM model and assessed the role of the intragenic miRNA miR-199a-1 in myopathy. We found that Dnm2 mRNA and miR-199a-1 were simultaneously elevated in Mtm1−/y skeletal muscle. Deletion of miR-199a-1 is suggested to attenuate the severity of myopathy in Mtm1−/y mice, as evidenced by increased muscle mass, improved muscle strength, and prolonged animal lifespan. Our analyses suggest that miR-199a-1 targeted nonmuscle myosin IIA (NM IIA) and thereby inhibited muscular postnatal development as well as muscle maturation. In addition, we found that the overexpression of DNM2/miR-199a-1 was regulated by ectopic Stat3 activation in XLCNM muscle. Our study revealed an important role for an intragenic microRNA in XLCNM pathological progression. Using CRISPR technology, we established two mouse lines with a 5-bp (Mtm1Δ5/y) and 7-bp (Mtm1Δ7/y) deletion within the Mtm1 gene (Fig. 1A). Note that Mtm1 is encoded in the X chromosome and the Y chromosome does not encode a Mtm1 allele, and the mutant male mice were referred to as Mtm1−/y. These mutant mice showed a retarded body growth and smaller muscle sizes (Fig. 1, B and C), which were comparable with those reported previously (26Buj-Bello A. Laugel V. Messaddeq N. Zahreddine H. Laporte J. Pellissier J.F. Mandel J.L. The lipid phosphatase myotubularin is essential for skeletal muscle maintenance but not for myogenesis in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The Western blotting assay showed a higher level of Dnm2 in Mtm1−/y tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in contrast to the control (Fig. 1D). As miR-199a is the intragenic microRNA of the Dnm2 gene and evolutionarily conserved across species (Fig. 1E), we measured miR-199a-1 expression level in the mutant TA muscles. Interestingly, the miR-199a-1 level was also significantly elevated (Fig. 1, F and G). These results indicated a simultaneous elevation of Dnm2 and miR-199a-1 expression in the myopathy muscle. To assess the role of miR-199a-1 in XLCNM pathogenesis, we first established miR-199a-1 deletion lines of mice (Fig. 2A). The birth of mutant pups followed an expected Mendelian ratio. The mice were fertile and reached adulthood without any obvious abnormalities (Fig. 2, B–D). Western blotting assays showed no apparent alteration of Dnm2 protein expression after miR-199a-1 deletion (Fig. 2, E and F). We then crossed Mtm1−/y mice with miR-199a-1 knockout mice and obtained offspring with four genotypes: Mtm1Δ5/y; miR-199a-1I8/+ (Hetero-1), Mtm1Δ7/y; miR-199a-1Δ3/+ (Hetero-2), Mtm1Δ5/y; miR-199a-1I8/I8 (Homo-1), and Mtm1Δ7/y; miR-199a-1Δ3/Δ3 (Homo-2). Real-time PCR showed a significant reduction of miR-199a-5p RNA expression, which is the processed product of miR-199a-1 transcription in the muscle of Homo-1 mice and a moderate inhibition for Hetero-1 muscle, compared with Mtm1Δ5/y muscle (Fig. 2G). Western blotting showed a similar level of Dnm2 protein in the muscle of miR-199a-1I8/I8 and Homo-1 mice (Fig. 2H). Most Mtm1Δ5/y mice died ∼6–7 weeks after birth, and the average survival time was 43 ± 1.5 days (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, most Homo-1 mice died ∼8–9 weeks after birth. The average survival time (57 ± 1.5 days) was significantly longer (∼30%) than that of Mtm1Δ5/y mice (p < 0.01). The Hetero-1 mice showed a moderately but significantly longer survival time than Mtm1Δ5/y (50 ± 2.1 days versus 43 ± 1.5 days, p < 0.05). This protective effect was also measured in Hetero-2 and Homo-2 mice (Fig. S1A). Thus, we concluded that reduction of intragenic miR-199a-1 expression inhibited the lethal phenotype of Mtm1−/y mice. Although the body weights among Mtm1−/y, Hetero-1/2 and Homo-1/2 mice showed no apparent difference (Fig. 3B and Fig. S1B), the ratio values of muscle mass/body weight of Homo-1 and Homo-2 mice were significantly larger than the controls (Fig. 3C and Fig. S1C). The ratio for the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was even comparable with the WT muscle (0.036 ± 0.002% (WT) versus 0.035 ± 0.003% (Homo-1) versus 0.032 ± 0.002% (Homo-2), p > 0.05). Histological examination showed that the Homo-1/2 muscles had a decreased percentage of myofibers with central nuclei (10.95 ± 1.63% (Mtm1Δ5/y) versus 6.08 ± 0.95% (Homo-1), p < 0.05; 11.44 ± 1.42% (Mtm1Δ7/y) versus 6.27 ± 0.84% (Homo-2), p < 0.05) and more myofibers with larger area (Fig. 3 (D–F) and Fig. S1 (D–F)). These results indicated that miR-199a-1 deletion improved the pathological feature of XLCNM, particularly in the fast-twitch muscles. We next measured the contractile response of the mutant EDL to electric stimulation (27Price F.D. von Maltzahn J. Bentzinger C.F. Dumont N.A. Yin H. Chang N.C. Wilson D.H. Frenette J. Rudnicki M.A. Inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling stimulates adult satellite cell function.Nat. Med. 2014; 20 (25194569): 1174-118110.1038/nm.3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mtm1Δ5/y muscle displayed a typical contraction action, but the maximal force was significantly less than that of WT muscle (3.44 ± 0.47 g versus 0.45 ± 0.06 g, p < 0.01). The Homo-1 muscle, in contrast to the Mtm1Δ5/y muscle, showed a significant increase in maximal force tension (0.99 ± 0.16 g versus 0.45 ± 0.07 g, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3G). Because the muscle masses were different among these muscles, we normalized the values and found that the maximal force of Homo-1 muscle was significantly higher than that of the Mtm1Δ5/y muscle (1.95 ± 0.25 N/cm2 versus 1.20 ± 0.14 N/cm2, p < 0.05), but still much lower than that of the WT control (1.95 ± 0.25 N/cm2 versus 3.73 ± 0.33 N/cm2, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3H). The phenotype was similar in Mtm1Δ7/y and Homo-2 muscle (Fig. S1, G and H). This result showed a functional improvement of the muscle after the deletion of miR-199a-1 in Mtm1−/y mice. Whereas XLCNM muscle has no apparent defect of myogenesis during embryonic development (26Buj-Bello A. Laugel V. Messaddeq N. Zahreddine H. Laporte J. Pellissier J.F. Mandel J.L. The lipid phosphatase myotubularin is essential for skeletal muscle maintenance but not for myogenesis in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99 (12391329): 15060-1506510.1073/pnas.212498399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), other reports suggested developmental defects for this muscle (28Bachmann C. Jungbluth H. Muntoni F. Manzur A.Y. Zorzato F. Treves S. Cellular, biochemical and molecular changes in muscles from patients with X-linked myotubular myopathy due to MTM1 mutations.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 (28007904): 320-33210.1093/hmg/ddw388PubMed Google Scholar). We isolated single myofiber from 3-week-old Mtm1−/y mice and observed fewer nuclei in the muscle also (Fig. 4 (A and B) and Fig. S2 (A and B)). Measurement by Western blotting showed decreased expression of myosin II, a marker of myoblast fusion, in early postnatal muscle (Fig. 4 (C and D) and Fig. S2 (C and D)). This result indicated a defect of myoblast fusion in early postnatal Mtm1−/y muscle (29White R.B. Biérinx A.S. Gnocchi V.F. Zammit P.S. Dynamics of muscle fibre growth during postnatal mouse development.BMC Dev. Biol. 2010; 10 (20175910): 2110.1186/1471-213X-10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 30Shin J.Y.

Lamina-associated polypeptide 1 is dispensable for embryonic myogenesis but required for postnatal skeletal muscle growth.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2017; 26 (27798115): 65-78PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether miR-199a-1 participates in this fusion process, we first measured the dynamic expression of miR-199a-5p during the fusion of C2C12 myoblasts. Before induction, C2C12 myoblasts exhibited a lower level of miR-199a-5p, which peaked at 1 day after induction and sustained thereafter (Fig. 5A). We next examined the fusion ability of C2C12 myoblasts after treatment with an oligonucleotide mimic (199-M) or inhibitor (199-I) of miR-199a-5p (Fig. 5B). Upon transfection with 199-M, myogenic fusion was inhibited, as illustrated by the 50% reduction in Myog and MyHC protein expression levels. Transfection with 199-I resulted in a significant increase in MyHC expression and a slight enhancement of Myog expression (Fig. 5, C–E). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that 199-M transfection led to a significant decrease in Myog-positive cells (12.69 ± 3.18% (199-M) versus 23.66 ± 2.90% (199-C), p < 0.05) and multinuclear myotube area, whereas 199-I transfection led to an increase in Myog-positive cells (32.35 ± 2.37% (199-I) versus 23.66 ± 2.90% (199-C), p < 0.05) and a larger multinuclear myotube area (Fig. 5, F–H). These results suggested that miR-199a-1 expression during C2C12 differentiation was targeted during myoblast fusion. To identify the target gene of miR-199a-1, we used the bioinformatics tools TargetScan (RRID:SCR_010845), PicTar (RRID:SCR_003343), and DIANA TOOLS (RRID:SCR_018425) to predict candidate target genes. Given that deletion of miR-199a-1 led to improvement of myopathic muscle, the function of its target gene was expected to promote myoblast fusion or similar processes. Following this rationale, we identified four candidate target genes, MYH9, SULF1, RAD23B, and PPARGC1A, for miR-199a-5p. We transfected miR-199a-5p into C2C12 cells and measured the target proteins by Western blotting. Among these proteins, only NM IIA expression, the product of Myh9 translation, was inhibited by overexpression of miR-199a-5p (Fig. 6 (A and B) and Fig. S3A). To verify direct interactions of miR-199a-5p with Myh9 mRNA, we constructed luciferase reporters with the WT and mutant 3′-UTRs of Myh9 and the miR-199a-5p expression vector (Fig. 6C). Co-transfection showed that miR-199a-5p targeted the 982–988 region of the Myh9 3′-UTR (Fig. 6D). To further test whether Myh9 is the target of miR-199a-5p, we used a Myh9-specific siRNA (si-Myh9) to impede the expression of endogenous NM IIA in C2C12 myoblasts (∼25%; Fig. 6, E and F). Down-regulation of endogenous NM IIA caused a reduction of myogenic markers in Myh9 knockdown myotubes (Myog, ∼30%; MyHC, ∼10%) (Fig. 6, E and F). Immunofluorescence analysis also confirmed a fusion defect in si-Myh9 myoblasts, as illustrated by a decrease in Myog-positive cells (∼60%) and a smaller multinuclear myotube area (∼60%) (Fig. 6, G–I). In addition, the introduction of 199-agomir (miR-199a-5p analog) into regenerative muscle resulted in a striking reduction in NM IIA and Myog levels, along with smaller regenerative myofibers, whereas 199-antagomir (miR-199a-5p antagonist) led to the opposite effect (Fig. 6, J and K). Collectively, these results suggested that miR-199–5p inhibited myoblast fusion by directly targeting NM IIA. To assess whether NM IIA was involved in the XLCNM, we first detected its expression in Mtm1−/y muscle. As we expected, a striking reduction in NM IIA was measured in these mice (Fig. 6L and Fig. S3B). As NM IIA participated in myofibrillogenesis that might reflect myotube fusion and muscle maturation (31Sanger J.W. Wang J. Fan Y. White J. Mi-Mi L. Dube D.K. Sanger J.M. Pruyne D. Assembly and maintenance of myofibrils in striated muscle.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2017; 235 (27832381): 39-7510.1007/164_2016_53Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we examined the muscle fibers by staining for α-actinin. The WT fibers showed clear and well-organized sarcomeres, whereas Mtm1Δ5/y sarcomeres showed misalignment of Z-lines, as reported previously (19Cowling B.S. Chevremont T. Prokic I. Kretz C. Ferry A. Coirault C. Koutsopoulos O. Laugel V. Romero N.B. Laporte J. Reducing dynamin 2 expression rescues X-linked centronuclear myopathy.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124 (24569376): 1350-136310.1172/JCI71206Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NM IIA was abundantly co-localized with α-actinin in WT muscle, but its abundance was greatly decreased in the Mtm1Δ5/y sarcomeres. However, in Homo-1 sarcomeres, there appeared to be an improvement of the Z-line arrangement, together with an increase in the amount of NM IIA (Fig. 6M). These results indicated that the impaired maturation of the mutant muscles was attributable to the down-regulation of NM IIA by miR-199a-1. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of overexpression of Dnm2/miR-199a-1 in XLCNM muscle, we analyzed the regulatory region of the Dnm2 gene with JASPAR (RRID:SCR_003030). We found conserved signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) binding sites upstream of the Dnm2 gene. Given the important role of Stat3 during myoblast fusion (32Sun L. Ma K. Wang H. Xiao F. Gao Y. Zhang W. Wang K. Gao X. Ip N. Wu Z. JAK1-STAT1-STAT3, a key pathway promoting proliferation and preventing premature differentiation of myoblasts.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179 (17908914): 129-13810.1083/jcb.200703184Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the abundant Stat3 cis-elements located within the region might contribute to the up-regulation of Dnm2/miR-199a-1 (Fig. 7A). To address the potential Stat3 regulation of the Dnm2/miR-199a-1 locus, we first measured Stat3 signaling in XLCNM muscle and found a significant elevation of the levels and phosphorylation of Stat3 (Pho-Stat3) compared with that of WT littermates (Fig. 7B). We then made a series of luciferase reporters containing Dnm2 promotor regions with either intact or mutant Stat3-binding sites (Fig. 7C). Upon transfecting HEK 293T cells with the reporters, we found that luciferase activity was significantly reduced in the Stat3-binding site mutant groups compared with the intact group (∼50%; Fig. 7C). Furthermore, we treated C2C12 myoblasts with Stat3 siRNA, measured the expression of Dnm2/miR-199a-1, and found that miR-199a-1 level was decreased by ∼50% with reduced Dnm2 expression (Fig. 7, D–F). Considering that phosphorylation is essential for Stat3 activation, we applied the specific inhibitor (5,15-DPP) of Pho-Stat3 to mice injured by BaCl2 and found a predicted reduction in Dnm2/miR-199a-1 level and an increase in NM IIA expression (Fig. 7, G–I). These results indicate that Stat3 activation drives Dnm2/miR-199a-1 expression in muscle. Collectively, aberrant activation of Stat3 in XLCNM muscle induced expression of the Dnm2 gene and intragenic miR-199a-1, which inhibited myoblast fusion and muscle maturation during early postnatal development via direct down-regulation of NM IIA (Fig. 8). Mutation of Mtm1 causes multiple skeletal muscle pathologies, including growth retardation, skeletal muscle wasting, and other severe complications (2Amburgey K. Tsuchiya E. de Chastonay S. Glueck M. Alverez R. Nguyen C.T. Rutkowski A. Hornyak J. Beggs A.H. Dowling J.J. A natural history study of X-linked myotubular myopathy.Neurology. 2017; 89 (28842446): 1355-136410.1212/WNL.0000000000004415Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As observed in previous studies, dysfunction of the Mtm1 gene is the leading cause of XLCNM (33Biancalana V. Beggs A.H. Das S. Jungbluth H. Kress W. Nishino I. North K. Romero N.B. Laporte J. Clinical utility gene card for: centronuclear and myotubular myopathies.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 20 (10.1038/ejhg.2012.91 22617344)10.1038/ejhg.2012.91Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this report, we found that, during the pathological process, the DNM2 gene, along with its intragenic miR-199a-1, was secondarily up-regulated in XLCNM muscle. Importantly, inhibition of miR-199a-1 expression attenuated the severity of the myopathy and, hence, prolonged lifespan significantly. As miR-199a-1 was able to apparently inhibit the process of myoblast fusion both in vitro and in vivo, we suggested that, during the process of myopathy, the elevated miR-199a-1 functioned as an inhibitor of myoblast fusion and myofiber maturation. In other words, the myopathy phenotype of XLCNM is partially attributable to the ectopic expression of miR-199a-1. Based on the collective results, we suggest a working model for XLCNM pathological progression, in which the Mtm1 mutation causes activation of Stat3 signaling and hence promotes Dnm2/miR-199a-1 expression, which inhibits myoblast fusion and muscle maturation.

Ca2+ was proposed to act as a ligand of P5 ATPases because it decreases the level of phosphoenzyme of the Spf1p P5A ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Repeating previous purification protocols, we obtained a purified preparation of Spf1p that was close to homogeneity and exhibited ATP hydrolytic activity that was stimulated by the addition of CaCl2. Strikingly, a preparation of a catalytically dead mutant Spf1p (D487N) also exhibited Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolytic activity. These results indicated that the Spf1p preparation contained a co-purifying protein capable of hydrolyzing ATP at a high rate. The activity was likely due to a phosphatase, since the protein i) was highly active when pNPP was used as substrate, ii) required Ca2+ or Zn2+ for activity, and iii) was strongly inhibited by molybdate, beryllium and other phosphatase substrates. Mass spectrometry identified the phosphatase Pho8p as a contaminant of the Spf1p preparation. Modification of the purification procedure led to a contaminant-free Spf1p preparation that was neither stimulated by Ca2+ nor inhibited by EGTA or molybdate. The phosphoenzyme levels of a contaminant-free Spf1p preparation were not affected by Ca2+. These results indicate that the reported effects of Ca2+ on Spf1p do not reflect the intrinsic properties of Spf1p but are mediated by the activity of the accompanying phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W3022057797,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an arbovirus of ruminants that has been circulating in Europe continuously for more than two decades and has become endemic in some countries such as Spain. Spain is ideal for BTV epidemiological studies since BTV outbreaks from different sources and serotypes have occurred continuously there since 2000; BTV-1 has been reported there from 2007 to 2017. Here we develop a model for BTV-1 endemic scenario to estimate the risk of an area becoming endemic, as well as to identify the most influential factors for BTV-1 persistence. We created abundance maps at 1-km2 spatial resolution for the main vectors in Spain, Culicoides imicola and Obsoletus and Pulicaris complexes, by combining environmental satellite data with occurrence models and a random forest machine learning algorithm. The endemic model included vector abundance and host-related variables (farm density). The three most relevant variables in the endemic model were the abundance of C. imicola and Obsoletus complex and density of goat farms (AUC 0.86); this model suggests that BTV-1 is more likely to become endemic in central and southwestern regions of Spain. It only requires host- and vector-related variables to identify areas at greater risk of becoming endemic for bluetongue. Our results highlight the importance of suitable Culicoides spp. prediction maps for bluetongue epidemiological studies and decision-making about control and eradication measures."
https://openalex.org/W3021467266,"According to a socio-functional perspective on emotions, displaying shame with averted gaze and a slumped posture following a norm violation signals that the person is ready to conform to the group’s moral standards, which in turn protects the person from social isolation and punishment. Although the assumption is intuitive, direct empirical evidence for it remains surprisingly limited and the mediating social-psychological mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, three experimental studies were conducted to investigate the social function of nonverbal displays of shame in the context of everyday norm violations. In Study 1, participants evaluated ten different expressions of emotion in regard to their affective valence, arousal, dominance, as well as social meaning in the context of norm violations. Displays of shame and sadness were seen as the most similar expressions with respect to the three affective dimensions and were perceived to communicate the perpetrator’s understanding of the group’s moral standards most effectively. In Study 2, participants read vignettes concerning norm violations and afterward saw a photograph of the perpetrator displaying nonverbal shame, sadness or a neutral expression. Perpetrators’ displays of shame and sadness increased perceived moral sense and amplified the observers’ willingness to cooperate with the perpetrators. However, neither display weakened the observer’s willingness to punish the perpetrator. In Study 3, the perpetrator was shown to display shame, sadness, anger or a neutral expression after getting caught at mild or severe norm violation. The results replicated previous findings but revealed also that the social effects of shame and sadness displays on punitive and cooperative intentions were mediated by different social appraisals. For example, display of shame uniquely reduced punitive intentions by increasing the perpetrator’s perceived moral sense, whereas expressions of both shame and sadness evoked empathy in the observers, which in turn reduced the punitive intentions. These results give support to the assumption that nonverbal shame displays serve a unique social function in preventing moral punishment and social exclusion. However, this support is only partial as the social functions of displaying shame are largely parallel to those of expressing sadness in the situation."

This was so even though the treatment resulted in decreased pain and increased mobility–both of which are associated with decreased mortality. It was decided to re-analyze the epidemiological data looking at all causes of death. The risk of leukaemia, solid cancer, death from non-cancer causes and from all causes in a study populations of men that received either the typical dose of 5.6 to 11.1 MBq of 224Ra, any dose of 224Ra or no radium were compared using the Cox proportional hazard model. For patients that received the typical dose of 224Ra agreed with the excess cancer was similar to that reported in previous studies. In contrast, these patients were less likely to die from non-cancer diseases and from all causes of death than the control patients. No excess mortality was also found in the population of all males that received the radionuclide. It is concluded that 224Ra treatment administered at low doses to patients with ankylosing spondylitis did not impact mortality from all causes. The study demonstrates the need to consider all causes of death and longevity when assessing health impacts following irradiation."

https://openalex.org/W3023821585,"Introduction Cholera is a highly infectious disease and remains a serious public health burden in Bangladesh. The objective of the study was to measure the private demand for oral cholera vaccines (OCV) in Bangladesh and to investigate the key determinants of this demand, reflected in the household’s willingness to pay (WTP) for oral cholera vaccine. Methods A contingent valuation method was employed in an urban setting of Bangladesh during December 2015 to January 2016. All respondents (N = 1051) received a description of World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified OCV, Shanchol™. Interviews were conducted with either the head of households or their spouse or a major economic contributor of the households. Respondents were asked about how much at maximum they were willing to pay for OCV for their own and their household members’ protection. Results are presented as the average and median of the reported maximum WTP of the respondents with standard deviations and 95% confidence interval. Natural log-linear regression model was employed to examine the factors influencing participants’ WTP for OCV. Results About 99% of the respondents expressed WTP for OCV with a maximum mean and median WTP per vaccination (2 doses) of US$ 2.23 and US$ 1.92 respectively. On the household level with an average number of 4.62 members, the estimated mean WTP was US$ 10 (median: US$ 7.69) which represents the perceived demand for OCV of a household to vaccinate against cholera. Conclusions The demand of vaccination further indicates that there is a potential scope for recovering a certain portion of the expenditure of immunization program by introducing direct user fees for future cholera vaccination in Bangladesh. Findings from this study will be useful for the policy-makers to make decision on cost-recovery in future oral cholera vaccination programs in Bangladesh and in similar countries."
https://openalex.org/W3021028105,"Systems biology applies concepts from engineering in order to understand biological networks. If such an understanding was complete, biologists would be able to design ad hoc biochemical components tailored for different purposes, which is the goal of synthetic biology. Needless to say that we are far away from creating biological subsystems as intricate and precise as those found in nature, but mathematical models and high throughput techniques have brought us a long way in this direction. One of the difficulties that still needs to be overcome is finding the right values for model parameters and dealing with uncertainty, which is proving to be an extremely difficult task. In this work, we take advantage of ensemble modeling techniques, where a large number of models with different parameter values are formulated and then tested according to some performance criteria. By finding features shared by successful models, the role of different components and the synergies between them can be better understood. We will address some of the difficulties often faced by ensemble modeling approaches, such as the need to sample a space whose size grows exponentially with the number of parameters, and establishing useful selection criteria. Some methods will be shown to reduce the predictions from many models into a set of understandable ""design principles"" that can guide us to improve or manufacture a biochemical network. Our proposed framework formulates models within standard formalisms in order to integrate information from different sources and minimize the dimension of the parameter space. Additionally, the mathematical properties of the formalism enable a partition of the parameter space into independent subspaces. Each of these subspaces can be paired with a set of criteria that depend exclusively on it, thus allowing a separate sampling/screening in spaces of lower dimension. By applying tests in a strict order where computationally cheaper tests are applied first to each subspace and applying computationally expensive tests to the remaining subset thereafter, the use of resources is optimized and a larger number of models can be examined. This can be compared to a complex database query where the order of the requests can make a huge difference in the processing time. The method will be illustrated by analyzing a classical model of a metabolic pathway with end-product inhibition. Even for such a simple model, the method provides novel insight."

Rhizome buds were subjected to various chilling temperatures for different duration and then transferred to warm conditions for germination and subsequent evaluation of their response to temperature and chilling requirements. A CUkingianum model was constructed to describe the contribution of low temperature to the chill unit, and it was suggested that 2.97°C was the optimum temperature and that 11.54°C was the upper limit for bud release. The CASkingianum model showed the relationship between chilling accumulation and sprouting percentage; therefore, rhizome bud development could be predicted through the model. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of transcriptomic data of endo-, eco- and nondormant rhizome buds generated 33 gene modules, 6 of which were significantly related to bud sprouting percentage. In addition, 7 significantly matched transcription factors (TFs) were identified from the promoters of 17 ""real"" hub genes, and DAG2 was the best matched TF that bound to AAAG element to regulate gene expression. The current study is valuable for developing a highly efficient strategy for seedling cultivation and provides strong candidates for key genes related to rhizome bud dormancy in P. kingianum."
https://openalex.org/W3023144338,"Mountain pine beetle (MPB) has become an invasive forest pest of mature pine in western North America as it spreads beyond its former endemic range. Management actions such as timber harvest can reduce the spread of MPB but may affect species of conservation concern like woodland caribou. Our goal was to inform MPB management within caribou ranges by exploring the impacts of MPB on caribou habitat-focusing on terrestrial lichens, an important winter food for caribou. We evaluated differences in lichen cover among four MPB management actions: timber harvest, wildfires, leaving MPB killed trees as-is, and single-tree cut-and-burn control. We found little evidence that leaving MPB killed trees as-is or controlling MPB using single-tree cut-and-burn impacted lichen cover. However, we found that lichen cover was lower in timber harvested and burned areas compared to intact undisturbed forest but only 10 to 20 years post-disturbance, respectively. Our results suggest that despite short-term reductions in lichen cover, using timber harvesting and prescribed burns to control MPB may balance management needs for MPB while maintaining lichen cover over time. However, using timber harvesting and prescribed burns to manage MPB is likely to have detrimental population-level effects on caribou by increasing the proportion of disturbed habitat and thus predators within caribou ranges. Among the four management actions that we evaluated, the cut-and-burn control program balances the need to limit the spread of MPB while also limiting negative impacts on caribou food. Our work addresses some of the challenges of managing competing forest and ecosystem values by evaluating the consequence of forest pest management actions on an important food resource for a species-at-risk."
https://openalex.org/W3021951266,"Mutations arising across the whole genome can hinder the emergence of evolutionary innovation required for adaptation because many mutations are deleterious. This trade-off is overcome by elevated mutagenesis to localized loci. Examples include phase variation and diversity-generating retroelements. However, these mechanisms are rare in nature; and all have narrow mutational spectra limiting evolutionary innovation. Here, we engineer a platform of Experimental Designed Genic Evolution (EDGE) to study the potential for evolutionary novelty at a single locus. Experimental evolution with EDGE shows that bacterial resistance to a novel antibiotic readily evolves, provided that elevated mutagenesis is focused on a relevant gene. A model is proposed to account for the cost and benefit of such single loci to adaptation in a changing environment and explains their high mutation rates, limited innovation, and the rarity of localized mutagenesis in nature. Overall, our results suggest that localized mutation systems can facilitate continuing adaptive evolution without necessarily restricting the spectrum of mutations. EDGE has utility in dissecting the complex process of adaptation with its localized, efficient evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3022897054,"The ability to modulate gene expression in response to changes in the host environment is essential for survival of the kinetoplastid parasite Leishmania. Unlike most eukaryotes, gene expression in kinetoplastids is predominately regulated posttranscriptionally. Consequently, RNA-binding proteins and mRNA-encoded sequence elements serve as primary determinants of gene regulation in these organisms; however, few have defined roles in specific stress response pathways. Leishmania species cannot synthesize purines de novo and must scavenge these essential nutrients from the host. Leishmania have evolved a robust stress response to withstand sustained periods of purine scarcity during their life cycle. The purine nucleobase transporter LdNT3 is among the most substantially up-regulated proteins in purine-starved Leishmania donovani parasites. Here we report that the posttranslational stability of the LdNT3 protein is unchanged in response to purine starvation. Instead, LdNT3 up-regulation is primarily mediated by a 33-nucleotide-long sequence in the LdNT3 mRNA 3′ UTR that is predicted to adopt a stem–loop structure. Although this sequence is highly conserved within the mRNAs of orthologous transporters in multiple kinetoplastid species, putative stem–loops from L. donovani and Trypanosoma brucei nucleobase transporter mRNAs were not functionally interchangeable for purine-responsive regulation. Through mutational analysis of the element, we demonstrate that species specificity is attributable to just three variant bases within the predicted loop. Finally, we provide evidence that the abundance of the trans-acting factor that binds the LdNT3 stem–loop in vivo is substantially higher than required for regulation of LdNT3 alone, implying a potential role in regulating other purine-responsive genes. The ability to modulate gene expression in response to changes in the host environment is essential for survival of the kinetoplastid parasite Leishmania. Unlike most eukaryotes, gene expression in kinetoplastids is predominately regulated posttranscriptionally. Consequently, RNA-binding proteins and mRNA-encoded sequence elements serve as primary determinants of gene regulation in these organisms; however, few have defined roles in specific stress response pathways. Leishmania species cannot synthesize purines de novo and must scavenge these essential nutrients from the host. Leishmania have evolved a robust stress response to withstand sustained periods of purine scarcity during their life cycle.

https://openalex.org/W3021113560,"Decorin is a member of small leucine-rich proteoglycan family, which is involved in multiple biological functions mainly as a structural and signaling molecule, and disturbances in its own metabolism plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthropathy. In this study, we aim to further explore the biological function of decorin and their role in human chondrocyte cell line, C28/I2. Lentivirus-mediated shRNA was applied to down-regulate decorin expression in C28/I2 chondrocytes. Effect of decorin knockdown on gene expression profiles was determined by RNA sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis. MTT, adhesion assays and flow cytometry were used to investigate the effect of decorin knockdown on cell proliferation, adhesion, and apoptosis. sGAG content in the culture medium was determined by DMMB assay. Stably transfected C28/I2 cells were seeded onto the cancellous bone matrix gelatin (BMG) to construct tissue-engineered cartilage. The histological patterns were evaluated by H&E and Toluidine blue staining. In this study, 1780 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including 864 up-regulated and 916 down-regulated genes were identified using RNA-Seq. The reliability of the gene expression was further verified by qRT-PCR. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed diverse cellular processes were affected by decorin silencing such as: cell adhesion, growth, and metabolism of extracellular matrix. In addition, we confirmed that down-regulation of decorin significantly suppressed cell proliferation and adhesion and induced apoptosis. The sGAG content in the media was significantly increased after decorin silencing. Engineered articular tissues in the decorin knockdown group exhibited cartilage destruction and proteoglycan loss as evidenced by H&E and Toluidine blue stains. Overall, this combined data helps to provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of decorin following its knockdown in C28/I2 cells."

This study explores OBGYNs' practices and difficulties in implementing MPL in the French-speaking part of Switzerland.An online survey was sent to 333 OBGYNs. Data analysis included: 1) descriptive and correlational statistics and 2) hierarchical cluster analysis to identify patterns of practices.OBGYNs evoked several problems in MPL implementation: absence of risk analysis in the companies, difficult collaboration with employers, lack of competencies in the field of occupational health. Preventive leave was underused, with sick leave being prescribed instead. Training had a positive effect on OBGYNs' knowledge and implementation of MPL. Hierarchical cluster analysis highlighted three main types of practices: 1) practice in line with legislation; 2) practice on a case-by-case basis; 3) limited practice. OBGYNs with good knowledge of MPL more consistently applied its provisions.The implementation of MPL appears challenging for OBGYNs. Collaboration with occupational physicians and training might help OBGYNs to better take on their role in maternity protection. MPL in itself could be improved."

Three-level growth curve models are used to analyze the association between exposure to grandparental wealth in early childhood and grandchildren's BMI growth trajectories, accounting for parental sociodemographic characteristics and maternal BMI levels.Children with less grandparental wealth in early childhood have higher initial BMI than children with more grandparental wealth. Further, increases in grandparental wealth in childhood are associated with a slower BMI growth rate. The wealth-body mass index associations are more evident among white children than black children.The study reveals a multigenerational social gradient to body mass index. Elevating the wealth levels of the grandparent generation could potentially reduce their grandchildren's obesity risk. The protective role of grandparental wealth seems to be more evident among white families than black families."
https://openalex.org/W3023922081,"Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 resulting from the binding with a negative regulator HDM2 is among the predominant defects in human cancers. p53-mimicking peptides whose conformational and proteolytic stability is enhanced by an all-hydrocarbon staple are being recognized as promising anticancer agents for disrupting the p53-HDM2 binding and reactivating p53. Herein, we conduct a computational modeling and thermodynamic characterization of stapled p53/HDM2 complex via molecular docking, simulations, and binding free energy analysis. The binding thermodynamics analysis is done based on the end-point calculation of the effective binding energy-a sum of the direct peptide-protein interaction energy and the dehydration penalty-and on its decomposition into contributions from specific groups constituting the complex. This allows us to investigate how individual amino acids in the stapled p53 and HDM2 contribute to the binding affinity. We find that not only the epitope residues (F19, W23 and L26), but also the hydrocarbon linker of the stapled p53 impart significant contributions. Our computational approach will be useful in designing new stapled peptides in which the staple location is also optimized to improve the binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W3021352892,"Four months into my second faculty job, I was shocked to discover that I had to record the hours I'd worked. I'd heard that others at the university were required to do that—but surely not faculty members, I thought. I was wrong. At the end of each month, I was expected to sign and submit a sheet that listed my start and end times each day. At first, I was annoyed that I had to waste my time on such a mundane task. But the practice of writing down my work hours was surprisingly illuminating, ultimately sending me down a path to better work-life balance.



> “The data have completely altered my view of work-life balance.” 

In my previous 16 years in academia, it had been up to me to judge whether I was working hard enough. Usually, I felt I needed to work harder.

During my Ph.D., I always believed I could make my dissertation better with extra effort. My research never felt finished, and I had no idea how many hours I was supposed to work. That made it easy to go down rabbit holes and work more hours than necessary.

After graduating, I continued to work long hours, even though my employment contracts spelled out shorter workweeks. During my postdoc years, I was supposed to work precisely 39.5 hours per week, according to the labor agreement for public servants in Germany. But nobody asked how long I actually spent in the office, and I probably exceeded that on a regular basis.

When I started my first faculty position, my contract stated that I work anywhere from 36 to 48 hours per week. At first, I appreciated the flexibility, hoping for the occasional guilt-free 36-hour workweek. But my teaching and administrative workloads were so high that I regularly reached the 48-hour mark.

I was conscious of my work hours. I kept track mentally and made a point of taking some time off when I felt as though I'd worked too hard. But there were stretches of time during my first faculty job when my children didn't see me enough, or when—between work and parental duties—I had no time to spend with my husband.

In my second faculty position, I expected that my work hours would again be my business. So when I was told to track them, I was surprised. My contract stated that I work 40 hours per week, and couldn't I be trusted to do so?

Grudgingly, I opened a spreadsheet and started to record my hours. It would have been easy to add standard start and end times for each day—for instance, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.—and be done with it. But my scientific tendencies kicked in, and I decided to keep careful track of my hours, even noting breaks.

I'm glad I did, because the data have completely altered my view of work-life balance. Recording my hours showed that I was racking up much longer workweeks than I realized. During the first month I started to track, for instance, I worked 15 hours more than was required of me—nearly two full workdays. That's far less than the insane hours that some academics work. But it was eye-opening for me.

With my tracking, I've found that I generally accumulate 1 week of overtime every 2 to 3 months. So now, every time I reach that milestone, I take a few days or even a whole week off. I spend that time at home with my family. Or I use the days to take a longer vacation, or to spend more time with relatives who visit. The breaks have improved my overall happiness and job satisfaction.

The data also help alleviate any guilt that I may have otherwise felt taking time off. I still have deadlines, tenure requirements, and the pressure to publish papers. And I still work a lot, sometimes even on weekends. But I now know how much I work—and that I deserve the time off.

When I am tenured, I won't have to submit my hours to my university any longer. But I'm going to continue to track them to help keep my work in bounds. To some academics, it may seem like a waste of time. But for me, it's been anything but.

I'd recommend opening a spreadsheet and tracking the hours that you spend at work. Even if you only do it for 1 or 2 weeks, you might be surprised what you'll discover."
https://openalex.org/W3023242322,"Objectives 
We extend the method of Significant Zero Crossings of Derivatives (SiZer) to address within-subject correlations of repeatedly collected longitudinal biomarker data and the computational aspects of the methodology when analyzing massive biomarker databases. SiZer is a powerful visualization tool for exploring structures in curves by mapping areas where the first derivative is increasing, decreasing or does not change (plateau) thus exploring changes and normalization of biomarkers in the presence of therapy.


Methods 
We propose a penalized spline SiZer (PS-SiZer) which can be expressed as a linear mixed model of the longitudinal biomarker process to account for irregularly collected data and within-subject correlations. Through simulations we show how sensitive PS-SiZer is in detecting existing features in longitudinal data versus existing versions of SiZer. In a real-world data analysis PS-SiZer maps are used to map areas where the first derivative of weight change after antiretroviral therapy (ART) start is significantly increasing, decreasing or does not change, thus exploring the durability of weight increase after the start of therapy. We use weight data repeatedly collected from persons living with HIV initiating ART in five regions in the International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) worldwide collaboration and compare the durability of weight gain between ART regimens containing and not containing the drug stavudine (d4T), which has been associated with shorter durability of weight gain.


Results 
Through simulations we show that the PS-SiZer is more accurate in detecting relevant features in longitudinal data than existing SiZer variants such as the local linear smoother (LL) SiZer and the SiZer with smoothing splines (SS-SiZer). In the illustration we include data from 185,010 persons living with HIV who started ART with a d4T (53.1%) versus non-d4T (46.9%) containing regimen. The largest difference in durability of weight gain identified by the SiZer maps was observed in Southern Africa where weight gain in patients treated with d4T-containing regimens lasted 59.9 weeks compared to 133.8 weeks for those with non-d4T-containing regimens. In the other regions, persons receiving d4T-containing regimens experienced weight gains lasting 38–62 weeks versus 55–93 weeks in those receiving non-d4T-based regimens.


Discussion 
PS-SiZer, a SiZer variant, can handle irregularly collected longitudinal data and within-subject correlations and is sensitive in detecting even subtle features in biomarker curves."
https://openalex.org/W3023518678,"Philip Anderson, groundbreaking physicist, died on 29 March at the age of 96. During his prolific career, Anderson launched many major branches of condensed matter physics. He excelled in extracting deep, foundational principles from raw experimental data and designed models that elegantly captured the essence of seemingly intractable quantum phenomena.

Anderson was born on 13 December 1923 in Indianapolis, Indiana. After obtaining his Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 1949 under the guidance of John H. Van Vleck, Anderson joined Bell Labs (where P.A.L. met him). In 1975, he joined the faculty at Princeton University (where he met N.P.O.) and remained there until his retirement in 1996.

Anderson had an uncanny ability to sniff out the deep questions raised by experimental data. In the late 1950s, experiments on silicon had found that the diffusion of a spin wave packet became anomalously slow at a temperature of 4 K. Anderson theorized that this “localization” (which he initially called “cisport,” a wordplay on “transport”) resulted from coherent interference of multiple reflections of the wave packet in a disordered crystalline environment. This 1958 prediction, dubbed “Anderson localization,” was cited in his 1977 Nobel Prize. In the 1980s, Anderson localization blossomed into a major experimental industry, and it has since been applied to optics, astronomy, ultracold atoms, and tumor detection in mammography.

Anderson's work in the 1950s also laid the foundation for the modern theory of magnetism by explaining how electron spins form local magnetic moments. This is an example of broken symmetry, where a system has less symmetry than suggested by basic physical laws. In a 1972 article in Science titled “More is different,” Anderson expanded on this concept, emphasizing that knowing the laws of physics at the microscopic level is not sufficient for understanding nature on a macroscopic scale. Anderson resolved another fundamental problem soon after physicists John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Robert Schrieffer published the theory of superconductivity in 1957. The symmetry breaking that was identified was expected to lead to a zero-mass mode, which was not seen in a superconductor. Anderson resolved this puzzle by pointing out that, in a superconductor, the wave function is coupled to the electromagnetic field, which merges with the zero-mass mode to become the familiar plasma oscillations. The photon has acquired a mass inside the superconductor. Anderson recognized that this mechanism solved the important problem of unwanted massless particles in theories hotly pursued at the time to unify quantum electrodynamics and weak interactions. Physicist Peter Higgs and others carried out the fully relativistic formulation, but Higgs gave Anderson credit in his paper and Nobel lecture. The Anderson-Higgs mechanism is now a cornerstone of particle and condensed matter physics.



Shortly after the discovery in 1986 of high-temperature (high- T c) superconductivity in cuprates, Anderson proposed a radical theory. He suggested that the parent state of the high- T c superconductor is a magnetic insulator driven by strong electron repulsion. Removing some of the electrons by chemical substitution allows the vacancies (“holes”) to move freely and conduct current. Anderson's identification of the parent state is now universally accepted. To explain why the mobile holes pair up to realize superconductivity, Anderson invoked the physics of spin liquids, which he pioneered in 1973. In a spin liquid, spins fail to attain the antiferromagnetic state because of conflicting lattice constraints and quantum fluctuations. Anderson called this the resonating valence bond (RVB) state. He proposed that when carriers are introduced into this state, it becomes a superconductor. These revolutionary ideas encountered considerable resistance. Today, although Anderson's specific mechanism remains controversial, many of the ideas in his 1987 paper, such as superconductivity arising from strong repulsion, have gained wide acceptance. The RVB state is the archetypal example of a quantum spin liquid, currently a topic of intense interest. Another idea of great importance is that the excitations of the spin liquid behave as electrons that have lost their charge but retain their spin. This early example of the notion of fractionalization is supported by exactly soluble models as well as by recent experiments. In time, Anderson's spin liquid RVB theory may well be remembered as his most profound and prescient.

Despite being a self-professed curmudgeon, Anderson was compassionate and amazingly loyal to friends and colleagues. Former students who had hit a rough patch often moved back to Princeton to work with him until they regained their footing. After learning that a collaborator had suffered a stroke, Anderson flew to stay with him for a week. He had a puckish sense of humor. During dinners that he and his wife, Joyce, regularly hosted, Anderson, offering coffee, would ask each guest “caffeine or non?” He would then prepare a single pot mixed with the correct proportions of each. To our amusement, he and Joyce took great pleasure in belting out songs by Tom Lehrer (a friend from college). Both held strong antiestablishment convictions. At the height of the Vietnam War, Anderson was once detained by security for posting “Stop the Bombing” pamphlets at Bell Labs. He was a vocal opponent of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Well into his 90s, Anderson retained a vibrant curiosity. He wanted to know who Dr. Dre was (a frequent clue in the New York Times crossword puzzle) and wanted to hear “Desolation Row” after Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize win.

Anderson's expansive intellect, his passion, and the special insights he brought to everything he touched will be sorely missed. His passing marks the loss of the last of the intellectual giants who shaped the field of quantum matter."
