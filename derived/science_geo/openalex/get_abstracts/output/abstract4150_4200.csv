https://openalex.org/W2070547356,"Embryonal carcinoma cells, the stem cells of teratocarcinomas, usually undergo extensive differentiation in vivo and in vitro to a wide variety of cell types. There exist, however, several embryonal carcinoma cell lines that have almost completely lost the capacity to differentiate, so that the cells are propagated primarily as the stem cells. Using one such cell line, F9, we have found that retinoic acid at concentrations as low as 10(-9) M induces multiple phenotypic changes in the cultures in vitro. These changes include morphological alteration at the resolution of the light microscope, elevated levels of plasminogen activator production, sensitivity to cyclic AMP compounds and increased synthesis of collagen-like proteins. The nature of these changes, as well as their independence of the continued presence of retinoic acid, are consistent with the proposition that retinoic acid induces differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells into endoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2047070443,"Avian sarcoma virus (ASV) induces sarcomas in animals and transforms fibroblasts to a neoplastic state in cell culture. A single viral gene (src) is responsible for both the induction and maintenance of neoplastic transformation. Recent work has identified a protein with a molecular weight of 60,000 daltons that is apparently encoded in src and may be the effector molecule for the gene (Brugge and Erikson, 1977; Purchio et al, 1978). The putative product of src can be immunoprecipitated by antisera obtained from rabbits bearing tumors induced by ASV. We have used this approach to isolate the protein to characterize further its genetic origins and possible function. Our rabbit tumor antisera precipitated a protein with a molecular weight of 60,000 daltons; according to serological, biochemical and genetic criteria, this protein is encoded in src. We found that this protein is phosphorylated and therefore denoted it pp60. Phosphorylation of pp60 could be accomplished in vitro with extracts of ASV-infected cells. A temperature-sensitive conditional mutation in src had no demonstrable effect on either the production or stability of pp60 in the infected cell, but phosphorylation of the protein was temperature-sensitive. Since the mutant src is not expressed at the restrictive temperature, our findings raise the possibility that phosphorylation of pp60 is required for its function as the putative effector of src. Immunoprecipitates prepared with extracts of ASV-infected cells and the rabbit tumor antisera contained a protein kinase activity that catalyzed phosphorylation of the heavy chains of immunoglobulin molecules, using either ATP or GTP as phosphate donor. The kinase activity immunoprecipitated in parallel with pp60 was obtained only from cells that contained a functioning product of src and could not be precipitated with antisera directed against structural proteins of ASV. A temperature-sensitive conditional mutation in src caused the kinase activity to be thermally inactivated in vitro far more rapidly than the activity from cells infected with wild-type virus. We conclude that both the protein kinase and pp60 are encoded in src, and that the enzymatic activity may be an intrinsic property of pp60. Phosphorylation of pp60 in cellular extracts was inhibited by calcium ion, whereas the immunoprecipitable kinase activity was not, suggesting that the kinase responsible for pp60 phosphorylation may be distinct from that encoded in src. Collett and Erikson (1978) have also identified a protein kinase activity associated with pp60. These findings raise the possibility that phosphorylation of specific cellular targets might account for transformation of the host cell by src."

https://openalex.org/W1487164341,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) cell surface receptors on human fibroblasts grown in culture bind specific plasma lipoproteins, initiating a series of events which regulate intracellular cholesterol metabolism. Specificity for the interaction with the receptors resides with the protein moieties of the lipoproteins, specifically with the B and E apoproteins of LDL and certain high density lipoproteins (HDLc HDLl), respectively. It was previously established that the amino acid arginine is a functionally significant residue in or near the recognition sites on the B and E apoproteins and that modification of this residue abolishes the ability of these apolipoproteins to bind to the receptor. The present study indicates that lysine residues are also involved in the lipoprotein-receptor interaction. Chemical modification of 15% of the lysine residues of LDL by carbamylation with cyanate or 20% by acetoacetylation with diketene prevents the LDL from competitively displacing unmodified 125I-LDL from the high affinity receptor sites or from binding directly to the receptor. Moreover, quantitative reversal of the aceto-acetylation of the lysine residues of LDL by hydroxylamine treatment regenerates the lysyl residues and reestablishes greater than 90% of the original binding activity of the LDL. The reversibility of this reaction establishes that the loss of binding activity which follows lysine modification is not due to an irreversible alteration of the LDL or HDLc but is probably due to an alteration of a property of the recognition site associated with specific lysine residues. While acetoacetylation and carbamylation neutralize the positive charge on the epsilon-amino group of lysine, reductive methylation selectively modifies lysine residues of LDL and HDLc without altering the positive charge, yet abolishes their ability to bind to the receptor. Preservation of the charge but loss of binding activity following reductive methylation of the lipoproteins suggests that the specificity of the recognition site does not reside simply with the presence of positive charges but depends on other more specific properties of the site determined by the presence of a limited number of the lysine (and arginine) residues. The precise role of lysine remains to be defined, but its function may be to establish and maintain the conformation of the recognition site or the alignment of reactive residues, or both, or to chemically react, through its epsilon-amino group, with the receptor (hydrogen bond formation would be such a possibility)."

https://openalex.org/W1532757302,"The biosynthesis of a secretory protein and a transmembrane viral glycoprotein are compared by two different experimental approaches. (a) NH2-terminal analysis has been performed on various forms of the transmembrane glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus synthesized in cell-free systems. The data presented demonstrate that the nascent precursor of the glycoprotein contains a sequence of 16 amino acids at the NH2 terminus, whose is Met-Lys-Cys-Leu-Leu-Tyr-Leu-Ala-Phe-Leu-Phe-Ile-(His-Val-Asn)-Cys. This signal is proteolytically cleaved during the process of insertion into microsomal membranes prior to chain completion. The new NH2 terminus of the inserted, cleaved, and glycosylated membrane protein is located within the lumen of the microsomal vesicles and is identical to that of the authentic glycoprotein from virions. (b) Nascent chain competition experiments were performed between this glycoprotein, bovine pituitary prolactin (a secretory protein), and rabbit globin (a cytosolic protein). It was found that the nascent membrane glycoprotein, but not nascent globin, competed with nascent prolactin for membrane sites involved in the early biosynthetic event of transfer across membranes. These data suggest that an initially common pathway is involved in the biogenesis of secretory proteins and at least one class of integral membrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1537427170,"Treatment of demembranated sea urchin sperm axonemes with an extraction solution containing 0.6 M NaCl, pH 7.0 for 10 min at 4 degrees C yields a solution of dynein 1 having a low, latent specific ATPase activity of about 0.25 mumol of Pi mg(-1) min(-1). Exposure of this dynein solution to 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 10 min at 25 degrees C causes an increase in its ATPase activity to about 3 mumol of Pi mg(-1) min(-1). A similar activation can be obtained by treating at 42 degrees C or by reacting with 60 mol of p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate/10(6) g of protein. The effects of these activating procedures are not additive, suggesting that they lead to a common activated state. Purification of the latent activity dynein 1 by sucrose density gradient centrifugation yields a monodisperse preparation sedimenting at 21 S, and having a molecular weight of 1,250,000 as determined by sedimentation diffusion and sedimentation equilibrium. Activation of the latent dynein 1 with Triton X-100 converts it to a form sedimenting at 10 to 14 S. The 21 S dynein is also converted to a 10 S form by dialysis against 5 mM imidazole/NaOH buffer, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7, although in this case, the ATPase activity is increased only about 3-fold, with another 3-fold activation being obtainable upon subsequent treatment with Triton X-100. The 21 S latent form of dynein 1 may represent the intact dynein arms that form moving cross-bridges and generate active sliding between adjacent doublet tubules of the flagellar axoneme. Electrophoretic analysis on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate suggests a model in which the 21 S dynein 1 particle is composed of three subunits of about 330,000 daltons and one of each of three medium weight subunits of 126,000, 95,000, and 77,000 daltons. When latent dynein 1 is added back to NaCl-extracted axonemes in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl, it recombines stoichiometrically and restores the arms on the doublet tubules with a 6-fold activation of its ATPase activity measured in the absence of KCl."

https://openalex.org/W2062519193,"Long-term habituation training in Aplysia californica produces a profound depression in the efficacy of synaptic transmission between mechanoreceptor neurons and gill motor neurons. This depression persists for more than 3 weeks. Thus a critical synaptic site for plasticity underlying long-term habituation is the same as that for short-term habituation. For this simple form of learning, short- and long-term memory share a common locus and aspects of a common mechanism: synaptic depression."
https://openalex.org/W2013026098,"Repetitive stimulation (100 pulses per second for 1 second) of the Schaffer collateral-commissural system of the rat hippocampus induces long-term potentiation of synaptic strength and produces significant changes in the subsequent endogenous phosphorylation of a 40,000-dalton protein from synaptic plasma membranes. This effect is not observed after stimulation in calcium-deficient media or after simulation at the rate of one pulse per second for 100 seconds. These findings provide evidence that repetitive synaptic activation can alter the phosphorylation machinery of the synaptic region and suggest a biochemical process which may be involved in the production of neuronal plasticity."

The relative potency of octopamine and various other amines in stimulating this enzyme, and effects of antagonists in blocking octopamine activation, correlate well with the known effects of these agents in affecting light production. In addition to suggesting a role for adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (or pyrophosphate) in the neural control of firefly flashing, identification of this potent enzyme should facilitate the characterization of phenylethylamine receptors in excitable tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2001285899,"We have studied the tumor (T) antigens induced by wild-type polyoma virus and several nontransforming mutants using immunoprecipitation with antisera from animals bearing polyomya-induced tumors followed by sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In a variety of mouse cells, wild-type virus induces a major T antigen species with apparent molecular weight of 100,000 daltons, and four minor T antigen species with apparent molecular weights of 63,000, 56,000, 36,000 and 22,000 daltons. Hr-t mutants, which have an absolute defect in transformation, induce a normal 100,000 dalton T antigen but are altered in the minor T antigen species. Hr-t deletion mutants induce none of the minor T antigen species seen in wild-type virus. In their place, these mutants induce T antigen species with molecular weights in the range of 6,000--9,000 daltons. The size of the very small T antigen products does not correlate in any simple way with the size or location of the deletions in the viral DNA. Point hr-t mutants induce two of the four minor T antigen species; they make apparently normal amounts of the 56,000 dalton product and reduced amounts of the 22,000 dalton product, but none of the 63,000 or 36,000 dalton species. Ts-a mutants, which have a temperature-sensitive defect in the ability to induce stable transformation, and which complement hr-t mutants, induce T antigens with the same mobility as wild-type; however, the 100,000 dalton T antigen of ts-a mutants is thermolabile compared to wild-type. A double mutant virus carrying both a ts-a mutation and a deletion hr-t mutation induces a thermolabile 100,000 dalton product and none of the minor T antigen species. Cell fractionation studies with productively infected cells have been carried out to localize the T antigen species."
https://openalex.org/W1484637220,"Incubation of human astrocytoma cells (1321N1) with low concentrations of isoproterenol results in a specific loss of responsiveness to catecholamines as evidenced by a decreased accumulation of cAMP in intact cells, a reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, and a decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor density, as measured by the specific binding of 125I-hydroxybenzylpindolol. The kinetics of desensitization suggest the involvement of two different reactions. The initial reaction involves a rapid loss of adenylate cyclase activity with little loss of beta-adrenergic receptors. Subsequently, a slower reaction results in the loss of measurable beta-adrenergic receptors. The degree of loss of both parameters was similar after 24 h of desensitization. It is concluded that the loss of beta-adrenergic receptors is an event that occurs as a result of the initial uncoupling of the beta-receptor-linked adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W2002001183,"This paper reports the effect of vitamin A and its derivatives, the retinoids, on plasminogen activator (PA) synthesis in chick embryo fibroblast cultures (CEF). Low concentrations of retinoic acid (RA) (10−6-10−10 M) and the retinoids stimulated PA synthesis in CEF; the maximal stimulation achieved, 9–10 fold, was somewhat lower than that obtained with optimal concentrations of the potent tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). This action of RA required protein and mRNA synthesis but, in contrast to enzyme induction by PMA and/or sarcoma virus transformation, retinoid effects were not significantly inhibited by elevated concentrations of cAMP. In inducing and/or stimulating PA production, the effects of RA and sarcoma virus transformation were synergistic rather than additive. Analogous synergism was observed between RA and PMA, but only at suboptimal concentrations of the latter. RA did not affect PA production in normal or transformed cultures maximally stimulated by PMA. These findings may help to elucidate the role of retinoids in promoting tumor growth, tissue remodeling and teratogenesis."

All these early functions were detected in cells supplied with complete early viral information. Cells microinjected with DNA fragments containing about 80, 70 or 60% of the early SV40 genome were still stained positively when challenged with antibody against T antigen, and the same cells were stimulated for cellular DNA synthesis when about 70% or more of the early viral information was available.

https://openalex.org/W2024812640,"Transfection experiments with HSV 1 in which one uses herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (TK) as a selectable prototrophic marker yield two classes of transformed cells: stable and unstable. In this report, we test the hypothesis that the stability phenotype can be explained by virus genome integration into a recipient cell chromosome. The method of analysis is by means of somatic cell genetics. We have isolated a series of microcell hybrids between a TK- Chinese hamster cell line and a transformed mouse cell line expressing the TK encoded by HSV 1. Several of the hybrid lines contain a single murine chromosome and express only the viral TK. Karyotypic analysis of these hybrids and of TK- derivatives generated by BrdUrd counterselection reveals that the TK+ phenotype is correlated with the presence of the terminal portion of the long arm of a specific murine chromosome. Results of extensive isozyme analyses of the hybrids and their TK- segregants fully corroborate the karyologic data. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the viral tk gene is covalently integrated into this chromosomal region which itself does not appear to carry the endogenous murine tk locus. Other more complicated models are discussed. Our findings also show that somatic cell genetics can be used to localize viral integration sites in host chromosomes with high resolution."

Amino acid analysis of the enzyme revealed that it was devoid of tryptophan. The enzyme contained 9 mol of cysteine/mol of enzyme but no disulfide linkage. The turnover number of the enzyme for the NADH-dependent reduction of cytochrome c was 17,100 at 24 degrees C. Although NADPH also acted as an electron donor, NADH was highly superior to NADPH.

Inhibition was also competitive with respect to mixed histone as determined in experiments utilizing one of the analogues. Acetylation of the terminal amino group of Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly lowered the Km for this substrate from 16 micrometer to 3 micrometer, but a similar modification of the inhibitory analogue Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ala-Leu-Gly resulted in no major change in the Ki value. An amount of inhibitory peptide sufficient to inhibit the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase by 90% caused less than 10% inhibition of several cyclic AMP-independent protein kinases indicating a high degree of specificity of inhibition by the peptide analogues.

Under these conditions, GTP is decreased by 80%, ATP is only 10 to 15% decreased, and UTP and CTP are slightly increased. Normal GTP levels and the responses to prostaglandin E1 and isoproterenol are restored if guanosine, but not inosine, is added with the inhibitor. The response to isoproterenol is recovered within 5 min after removal of mycophenolic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2118541996,"Abstract Conditional host range mutants of VSV New Jersey (designated td CE mutants), which multiplied at 31° and 39°C in BHK-21 cells but only at 31° C in chick embryo (CE) cells, were isolated at a higher frequency than conventional ts mutants after 5-fluorouracil mutagenesis. Three types of td CE mutant could be distinguished by their degree of temperature-sensitivity in other avian cells. Non-conditional host range mutants ( hr CE), which failed to multiply in CE cells at both 31° and 39°C, were isolated rarely. The hrCE mutants also failed to produce plaques on MDBK cells. Temperature-shift experiments showed that the host restriction operated early in the viral growth cycle. Nevertheless, pseudotypes of Chandipura virus with envelopes supplied by td CE or hr CE mutants were not restricted in CE cells, indicating that restriction did not occur at the cell surface. This was consistent with the observation of the in vitro temperature-sensitivity of the virion polymerase of two of the three types of td CE mutant and the hypothesis that the host range phenotype was determined by host factors which interacted with the virion polymerase (Szilagyi and Pringle, 1975). Comparison of td CE and hr CE mutants in other cultured cells did not reveal any association of conditional temperature-sensitivity with species of origin, degree of transformation, time in culture, chronic infection with cytoplasmic (RS virus) or nuclear (ALV) RNA viruses, or morphological type. The td CE mutants, however, tended to be temperature-sensitive in the embryonic cells of some species. The differentiation of pluripotent murine embryonal carcinoma cells to embryoid bodies was accompanied by a decrease in restrictiveness. These results suggest that several host factors may interact with the VSV polymerase, and that the absence of these factors at certain stages of differentiation may have a protective effect."
https://openalex.org/W1990849144,"Abstract The RNA genome of avian sarcoma virus (ASV) and 38S polyadenylated RNA from cells producing ASV directed the cell-free synthesis of two viral gene products: Pr76 gag , the precursor to structural proteins of the virion core, and P180 gag/pol , a joint product of two viral genes that is the putative precursor of viral reverse transcriptase. To test the hypothesis that P180 gag/pol is synthesized by read-through of the termination codon for gag, we determined the effect of purified yeast suppressor tRNAs on cell-free translation from gag and pol . Although the synthesis of P180 gag/pol was not enhanced by the suppressor tRNAs, the use of amber suppressor tRNA reduced the synthesis of Pr76 gag and resulted in the synthesis of a new 80, 000 dalton polypeptide (P80) that contained the antigenic determinants of gag. Studies using chemical inhibitors of initiation of translation demonstrated that P80 was generated by the addition of amino acids to the carboxy terminus of Pr76 gag . We conclude that the gag gene of ASV is terminated by an amber codon (UAG), and that a second termination signal occurs ∼120 nucleotides downstream. Our data indicate that suppression of a single termination codon does not suffice for the production of P180 gag/pol . Thus it is doubtful that suppression by tRNA is responsible for the synthesis of this protein. The mechanism by which P180 gag/pol is synthesized in infected cells remains uncertain."

We now report that DNA of uninfected V+ cells is infectious at a low level when sheared to the approximate size of the virus genome. These results suggest that the endogenous virus genome of uninfected V+ chicken cells can be converted to an infectious form by separating it from adjacent cellular DNA sequences, as predicted by the cis-acting control element model."

Neither the oxidized coenzyme nor the reduced coenzyme appears to be involved in the formation of this complex. These results suggest that the mechanism of substrate inhibition that occurs with the pig heart malate dehydrogenases is different from that observed with the lactate dehydrogenases from chicken hearts. The inhibition constants for oxalacetate are 2.0 mM with the mitochondrial enzyme and 4.5 mM with the cytoplasmic enzyme. Since the in vivo concentration of oxalacetate is reported to be about 10 micrometer, these data suggest that the substrate inhibition that is exhibited by the malate dehydrogenases may not be of any significance in vivo."

The membrane effects of calcium and of PTH appear to be independently regulated as PTH-induced desensitization can be initiated in the absence of calcium. In addition, calcium effects on PTH-sensitive adenylate cyclase follow a different calcium dose-response than PTH-like metabolic changes. These results suggest that the effect of calcium on the membrane is not directly related to its induction of PTH-like metabolic changes. A possible role of calcium as an in vivo regulator of bone cell sensitivity to PTH is discussed."

The phosphorylated intermediate formed from the N-ethylmaleimide-treatedenzyme was less sensitive to decomposition by KC1 and more sensitive to ADP when measured at either 0” or 22”C, compared to a native enzyme. The ouabain-binding capacity of native enzyme at 0” and 30°C in the presence of either magnesium plus inorganic phosphate or magnesium plus ATP plus sodium was the same. The ouabain-binding capacity of the N-ethylmaleimidetreated enzyme in the presence of magnesium plus inorganic phosphate was the same at 0°C as it was at 30°C. However, in the presence of magnesium plus ATP plus sodium, the treated enzyme bound only half as much ouabain at 0°C as it did at 3O”C, even when the reaction was extended to several hours. The rates of ouabain binding were approximately equal for the native and N-ethylmaleimide-treated enzyme when measured in the presence of magnesium alone or magnesium plus ATP.

Potassium and sodium ions at 55 mM had no effect on the calcium-independent phosphodiesterase from rat cerebrum. The results indicate that at normal intracellular concentrations of potassium ions the activity of the calcium-dependent phosphodiesterase is virtually completely dependent on the presence of calcium plus activator protein."
https://openalex.org/W2012623264,"RECENT studies (for review see ref. 1) have indicated the existence of endogenous opiate-related peptides and opiate receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (the caudal-most component of the trigeminal spinal tract nucleus in the brain stem). Both structures have marginal and substantia gelatinosa layers, receive the terminals of Aδ and C nociceptive afferents, and constitute essential components of spinal or trigeminal nociceptive pathways2,3. It has been suggested1,4–7 that endogenous opiate-related peptides located in presynaptic endings play an important part in nociceptive transmission by inhibiting the presynaptic input to neurones in nociceptive pathways; presynaptic inhibition is thought8 to result from primary afferent depolarisation (PAD). It has previously been found that jaw-opening reflex activity9–11 and the responses of trigeminal brain stem neurones10,11 to noxious orofacial stimuli can be suppressed by stimulation of the periaqueductal grey matter (PGM) and that this descending control is at least partially narcotic-related in the cat, as it can often be reversed by administering the opiate antagonist naloxone. Furthermore, the iontophoretic application of the opiate-related peptide enkephalin also depresses the activity of these neurones12,13. If the opiate-related peptides are in fact involved in this suppression at a presynaptic level, then by stimulating PGM and related structures one should be able to produce PAD in nociceptive afferents and then abolish the PAD by naloxone administration. We describe here the first test of this proposition, using the tooth pulp (TP) as the source of nociceptive afferents14,15. We have found that these afferents are subject to PAD which, however, cannot be abolished by naloxone."
https://openalex.org/W1965914008,"C6 glioma cells and B104 neuroblastoma cells both possess adenylate cyclase activity, but only C6 cells have beta-adrenergic receptors. However, when cocultured with B104 cells, C6 cells show a marked decrease in their ability to accumulate adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate upon stimulation with beta receptor agonists. Since both beta receptors and cholera toxin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities are present in C6/B104 cocultures, we conclude that the beta receptor/adenylate cyclase transduction mechanism in cocultured C6 cells is uncoupled."
