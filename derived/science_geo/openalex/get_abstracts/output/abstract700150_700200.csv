https://openalex.org/W4294884160,"Microbial colonization of the mammalian intestine elicits inflammatory or tolerogenic T cell responses, but the mechanisms controlling these distinct outcomes remain poorly understood, and accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant immunity to intestinal microbiota is causally associated with infectious, inflammatory and malignant diseases1–8. Here we define a critical pathway controlling the fate of inflammatory versus tolerogenic T cells that respond to the microbiota and express the transcription factor RORγt. We profiled all RORγt+ immune cells at single-cell resolution from the intestine-draining lymph nodes of mice and reveal a dominant presence of T regulatory (Treg) cells and lymphoid tissue inducer-like group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), which co-localize at interfollicular regions. These ILC3s are distinct from extrathymic AIRE-expressing cells, abundantly express major histocompatibility complex class II, and are necessary and sufficient to promote microbiota-specific RORγt+ Treg cells and prevent their expansion as inflammatory T helper 17 cells. This occurs through ILC3-mediated antigen presentation, αV integrin and competition for interleukin-2. Finally, single-cell analyses suggest that interactions between ILC3s and RORγt+ Treg cells are impaired in inflammatory bowel disease. Our results define a paradigm whereby ILC3s select for antigen-specific RORγt+ Treg cells, and against T helper 17 cells, to establish immune tolerance to the microbiota and intestinal health. ILC3s expressing MHC class II control the fate of inflammatory versus tolerogenic T cells that respond to the microbiota by selecting for antigen-specific RORγt+ Treg cells and against TH17 cells, establishing intestinal homoeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W4294904414,"Lysosomal dysfunction has been increasingly linked to disease and normal ageing1,2. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), a hallmark of lysosome-related diseases, can be triggered by diverse cellular stressors3. Given the damaging contents of lysosomes, LMP must be rapidly resolved, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using an unbiased proteomic approach, we show that LMP stimulates a phosphoinositide-initiated membrane tethering and lipid transport (PITT) pathway for rapid lysosomal repair. Upon LMP, phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase type 2α (PI4K2A) accumulates rapidly on damaged lysosomes, generating high levels of the lipid messenger phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Lysosomal phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in turn recruits multiple oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein (ORP) family members, including ORP9, ORP10, ORP11 and OSBP, to orchestrate extensive new membrane contact sites between damaged lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum. The ORPs subsequently catalyse robust endoplasmic reticulum-to-lysosome transfer of phosphatidylserine and cholesterol to support rapid lysosomal repair. Finally, the lipid transfer protein ATG2 is also recruited to damaged lysosomes where its activity is potently stimulated by phosphatidylserine. Independent of macroautophagy, ATG2 mediates rapid membrane repair through direct lysosomal lipid transfer. Together, our findings identify that the PITT pathway maintains lysosomal membrane integrity, with important implications for numerous age-related diseases characterized by impaired lysosomal function."

https://openalex.org/W4294782938,"Efforts to model the human gut microbiome in mice have led to important insights into the mechanisms of host-microbe interactions. However, the model communities studied to date have been defined or complex, but not both, limiting their utility. Here, we construct and characterize in vitro a defined community of 104 bacterial species composed of the most common taxa from the human gut microbiota (hCom1). We then used an iterative experimental process to fill open niches: germ-free mice were colonized with hCom1 and then challenged with a human fecal sample. We identified new species that engrafted following fecal challenge and added them to hCom1, yielding hCom2. In gnotobiotic mice, hCom2 exhibited increased stability to fecal challenge and robust colonization resistance against pathogenic Escherichia coli. Mice colonized by either hCom2 or a human fecal community are phenotypically similar, suggesting that this consortium will enable a mechanistic interrogation of species and genes on microbiome-associated phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W4294904731,"Abstract Establishing and maintaining tolerance to self-antigens or innocuous foreign antigens is vital for the preservation of organismal health. Within the thymus, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) expressing autoimmune regulator (AIRE) have a critical role in self-tolerance through deletion of autoreactive T cells and promotion of thymic regulatory T (T reg ) cell development 1–4 . Within weeks of birth, a separate wave of T reg cell differentiation occurs in the periphery upon exposure to antigens derived from the diet and commensal microbiota 5–8 , yet the cell types responsible for the generation of peripheral T reg (pT reg ) cells have not been identified. Here we describe the identification of a class of RORγt + antigen-presenting cells called Thetis cells, with transcriptional features of both mTECs and dendritic cells, comprising four major sub-groups (TC I–TC IV). We uncover a developmental wave of Thetis cells within intestinal lymph nodes during a critical window in early life, coinciding with the wave of pT reg cell differentiation. Whereas TC I and TC III expressed the signature mTEC nuclear factor AIRE, TC IV lacked AIRE expression and was enriched for molecules required for pT reg generation, including the TGF-β-activating integrin αvβ8. Loss of either major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) or ITGB8 by Thetis cells led to a profound impairment in intestinal pT reg differentiation, with ensuing colitis. By contrast, MHCII expression by RORγt + group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and classical dendritic cells was neither sufficient nor required for pT reg generation, further implicating TC IV as the tolerogenic RORγt + antigen-presenting cell with an essential function in early life. Our studies reveal parallel pathways for the establishment of tolerance to self and foreign antigens in the thymus and periphery, respectively, marked by the involvement of shared cellular and transcriptional programmes."
https://openalex.org/W4294904774,"The mutualistic relationship of gut-resident microbiota and the host immune system promotes homeostasis that ensures maintenance of the microbial community and of a largely non-aggressive immune cell compartment1,2. The consequences of disturbing this balance include proximal inflammatory conditions, such as Crohn’s disease, and systemic illnesses. This equilibrium is achieved in part through the induction of both effector and suppressor arms of the adaptive immune system. Helicobacter species induce T regulatory (Treg) and T follicular helper (TFH) cells under homeostatic conditions, but induce inflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells when induced Treg (iTreg) cells are compromised3,4. How Helicobacter and other gut bacteria direct T cells to adopt distinct functions remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the cells and molecular components required for iTreg cell differentiation. We found that antigen presentation by cells expressing RORγt, rather than by classical dendritic cells, was required and sufficient for induction of Treg cells. These RORγt+ cells—probably type 3 innate lymphoid cells and/or Janus cells5—require the antigen-presentation machinery, the chemokine receptor CCR7 and the TGFβ activator αv integrin. In the absence of any of these factors, there was expansion of pathogenic TH17 cells instead of iTreg cells, induced by CCR7-independent antigen-presenting cells. Thus, intestinal commensal microbes and their products target multiple antigen-presenting cells with pre-determined features suited to directing appropriate T cell differentiation programmes, rather than a common antigen-presenting cell that they endow with appropriate functions. Induction of T regulatory cells by gut microbes is mediated by antigen-presenting RORγt+ cells, unlike that of T follicular helper and T helper 17 cells, which requires different cell types."

https://openalex.org/W4225133058,"Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors feature both tightly-bound excitons with large oscillator strength and potentially long-lived coherent magnons due to the presence of bandgap and spatial confinement. While magnons and excitons are energetically mismatched by orders of magnitude, their coupling can lead to efficient optical access to spin information. Here we report strong magnon-exciton coupling in the 2D van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor CrSBr. Coherent magnons launched by above-gap excitation modulate the interlayer hybridization, which leads to dynamic modulation of excitonic energies. Time-resolved exciton sensing reveals magnons that can coherently travel beyond 7 micrometer, with coherence time above 5 ns. We observe this exciton-coupled coherent magnons in both even and odd number of layers, with and without compensated magnetization, down to the bilayer limit. Given the versatility of vdW heterostructures, these coherent 2D magnons may be basis for optically accessible magnonics and quantum interconnects."

https://openalex.org/W4294904949,"Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule motor that is activated by its cofactor dynactin and a coiled-coil cargo adaptor1-3. Up to two dynein dimers can be recruited per dynactin, and interactions between them affect their combined motile behaviour4-6. Different coiled-coil adaptors are linked to different cargos7,8, and some share motifs known to contact sites on dynein and dynactin4,9-13. There is limited structural information on how the resulting complex interacts with microtubules and how adaptors are recruited. Here we develop a cryo-electron microscopy processing pipeline to solve the high-resolution structure of dynein-dynactin and the adaptor BICDR1 bound to microtubules. This reveals the asymmetric interactions between neighbouring dynein motor domains and how they relate to motile behaviour. We found that two adaptors occupy the complex. Both adaptors make similar interactions with the dyneins but diverge in their contacts with each other and dynactin. Our structure has implications for the stability and stoichiometry of motor recruitment by cargos."
https://openalex.org/W4294904545,"Abstract The perception of fat evokes strong appetitive and consummatory responses 1 . Here we show that fat stimuli can induce behavioural attraction even in the absence of a functional taste system 2,3 . We demonstrate that fat acts after ingestion via the gut–brain axis to drive preference for fat. Using single-cell data, we identified the vagal neurons responding to intestinal delivery of fat, and showed that genetic silencing of this gut-to-brain circuit abolished the development of fat preference. Next, we compared the gut-to-brain pathways driving preference for fat versus sugar 4 , and uncovered two parallel systems, one functioning as a general sensor of essential nutrients, responding to intestinal stimulation with sugar, fat and amino acids, whereas the other is activated only by fat stimuli. Finally, we engineered mice lacking candidate receptors to detect the presence of intestinal fat, and validated their role as the mediators of gut-to-brain fat-evoked responses. Together, these findings reveal distinct cells and receptors that use the gut–brain axis as a fundamental conduit for the development of fat preference."

https://openalex.org/W4294904953,"Infections induce a set of pleiotropic responses in animals, including anorexia, adipsia, lethargy and changes in temperature, collectively termed sickness behaviours1. Although these responses have been shown to be adaptive, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been elucidated2-4. Here we use of a set of unbiased methodologies to show that a specific subpopulation of neurons in the brainstem can control the diverse responses to a bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) that potently induces sickness behaviour. Whole-brain activity mapping revealed that subsets of neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the area postrema (AP) acutely express FOS after LPS treatment, and we found that subsequent reactivation of these specific neurons in FOS2A-iCreERT2 (also known as TRAP2) mice replicates the behavioural and thermal component of sickness. In addition, inhibition of LPS-activated neurons diminished all of the behavioural responses to LPS. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the NTS-AP was used to identify LPS-activated neural populations, and we found that activation of ADCYAP1+ neurons in the NTS-AP fully recapitulates the responses elicited by LPS. Furthermore, inhibition of these neurons significantly diminished the anorexia, adipsia and locomotor cessation seen after LPS injection. Together these studies map the pleiotropic effects of LPS to a neural population that is both necessary and sufficient for canonical elements of the sickness response, thus establishing a critical link between the brain and the response to infection."
https://openalex.org/W4294904148,"Optical atomic clocks are our most precise tools to measure time and frequency. They enable precision frequency comparisons between atoms in separate locations to probe the space-time variation of fundamental constants, the properties of dark matter, and for geodesy. Measurements on independent systems are limited by the standard quantum limit (SQL); measurements on entangled systems, in contrast, can surpass the SQL to reach the ultimate precision allowed by quantum theory - the so-called Heisenberg limit. While local entangling operations have been used to demonstrate this enhancement at microscopic distances, frequency comparisons between remote atomic clocks require rapid high-fidelity entanglement between separate systems that have no intrinsic interactions. We demonstrate the first quantum network of entangled optical clocks using two $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions separated by a macroscopic distance (2 m), that are entangled using a photonic link. We characterise the entanglement enhancement for frequency comparisons between the ions. We find that entanglement reduces the measurement uncertainty by a factor close to $\sqrt{2}$, as predicted for the Heisenberg limit, thus halving the number of measurements required to reach a given precision. Practically, today's optical clocks are typically limited by laser dephasing; in this regime, we find that using entangled clocks confers an even greater benefit, yielding a factor 4 reduction in the number of measurements compared to conventional correlation spectroscopy techniques. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate this enhancement for measuring a frequency shift applied to one of the clocks. Our results show that quantum networks have now attained sufficient maturity for enhanced metrology. This two-node network could be extended to additional nodes, to other species of trapped particles, or to larger entangled systems via local operations."

https://openalex.org/W4294904531,"Many genetic variants affect disease risk by altering context-dependent gene regulation. Such variants are difficult to study mechanistically using current methods that link genetic variation to steady-state gene expression levels, such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To address this challenge, we developed the cistrome-wide association study (CWAS), a framework for identifying genotypic and allele-specific effects on chromatin that are also associated with disease. In prostate cancer, CWAS identified regulatory elements and androgen receptor-binding sites that explained the association at 52 of 98 known prostate cancer risk loci and discovered 17 additional risk loci. CWAS implicated key developmental transcription factors in prostate cancer risk that are overlooked by eQTL-based approaches due to context-dependent gene regulation. We experimentally validated associations and demonstrated the extensibility of CWAS to additional epigenomic datasets and phenotypes, including response to prostate cancer treatment. CWAS is a powerful and biologically interpretable paradigm for studying variants that influence traits by affecting transcriptional regulation. Cistrome-wide association study (CWAS) is an approach for nominating variants that impact traits through effects on chromatin state. CWAS performed on 307 prostate cistromes identifies candidate loci for prostate cancer and androgen-related traits."

https://openalex.org/W4294904968,"Folates are essential nutrients with important roles as cofactors in one-carbon transfer reactions, being heavily utilized in the synthesis of nucleic acids and the metabolism of amino acids during cell division1,2. Mammals lack de novo folate synthesis pathways and thus rely on folate uptake from the extracellular milieu3. The human reduced folate carrier (hRFC, also known as SLC19A1) is the major importer of folates into the cell1,3, as well as chemotherapeutic agents such as methotrexate4–6. As an anion exchanger, RFC couples the import of folates and antifolates to anion export across the cell membrane and it is a major determinant in methotrexate (antifolate) sensitivity, as genetic variants and its depletion result in drug resistance4–8. Despite its importance, the molecular basis of substrate specificity by hRFC remains unclear. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of hRFC in the apo state and captured in complex with methotrexate. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations and functional experiments, our study uncovers key determinants of hRFC transport selectivity among folates and antifolate drugs while shedding light on important features of anion recognition by hRFC. Cryo-EM structures provide insight into how the antifolate methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug, is recognized by the reduced folate carrier."

https://openalex.org/W4294783023,"Dysregulation of long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1, L1), a dominant class of transposable elements in the human genome, has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, but whether elevated L1 expression is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration has not been directly tested. Here, we show that the cerebellar expression of L1 is significantly elevated in ataxia telangiectasia patients and strongly anti-correlated with the expression of epigenetic silencers. To examine the role of L1 in the disease etiology, we developed an approach for direct targeting of the L1 promoter for overexpression in mice. We demonstrated that L1 activation in the cerebellum led to Purkinje cell dysfunctions and degeneration and was sufficient to cause ataxia. Treatment with a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor blunted ataxia progression by reducing DNA damage, attenuating gliosis, and reversing deficits of molecular regulators for calcium homeostasis in Purkinje cells. Our study provides the first direct evidence that L1 activation can drive neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4294783794,"The use of body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) is conceptualized as a means of coping with stress. However, the neurological mechanism by which repetitive behaviors affect anxiety regulation is unclear. Here, we identify that the excitatory somatostatin-positive neurons in the medial paralemniscal nucleus (MPLSST neurons) in mice promote self-grooming and encode reward. MPLSST neurons display prominent grooming-related neuronal activity. Loss of function of MPLSST neurons impairs both self-grooming and post-stress anxiety alleviation. Activation of MPLSST neurons is rewarding and sufficient to drive reinforcement by activating dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and eliciting dopamine release. The neuropeptide SST facilitates the rewarding impact of MPLSST neurons. MPLSST neuron-mediated self-grooming is triggered by the input from the central amygdala (CeA). Our study reveals a dual role of CeA-MPLSST-VTADA circuit in self-grooming and post-stress anxiety regulation and conceptualizes MPLSST neurons as an interface linking the stress and reward systems in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4294783022,"For many cancer patients, chemotherapy produces untreatable life-long neurologic effects termed chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). We discovered that the chemotherapy methotrexate (MTX) adversely affects oxidative metabolism of non-cancerous choroid plexus (ChP) cells and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We used a ChP-targeted adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector approach in mice to augment CSF levels of the secreted antioxidant SOD3. AAV-SOD3 gene therapy increased oxidative defense capacity of the CSF and prevented MTX-induced lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. Furthermore, this gene therapy prevented anxiety and deficits in short-term learning and memory caused by MTX. MTX-induced oxidative damage to cultured human cortical neurons and analyses of CSF samples from MTX-treated lymphoma patients demonstrated that MTX diminishes antioxidant capacity of patient CSF. Collectively, our findings motivate the advancement of ChP- and CSF-targeted anti-oxidative prophylactic measures to relieve CRCI."
https://openalex.org/W4294884668,"Interoception is a collection of different representations of signals originating within the body. The way of perceiving these signals seems to be related to both emotion regulation and dysregulation, and its dysfunction is implicated across a variety of affective disorders. There is a growing body of research investigating the relationship between mindfulness meditation practices and interoception showing an increase in interoceptive processes with regular training. In this study, we assessed the effects of a three-day mindfulness training on interoceptive accuracy and sensibility in a young healthy adult sample. Moreover, we also performed a mediation analysis on interoceptive sensibility and anxiety. Healthy participants (n = 40) naive to mindfulness practices were randomized to a brief mindfulness training (MT) (n = 20, females = 10) or to an active control group (n = 20, females = 10). Participants were assessed before and after the 3-days intervention for both groups on measures of interoception and anxiety in a modified intention-to-treat approach. The brief mindfulness training group increased interoceptive sensibility while active control had no effects on this variable. Five out of eight subdomains of interoceptive sensibility were significantly improved after mindfulness training. There was no significant difference in interoceptive accuracy after training. The effect of a brief mindfulness training on interoceptive sensibility mediated changes in the anxiety state. To date, this is the first study showing a plausible mechanism of a brief mindfulness training to explain the anxiolytic effects of meditation practices.

https://openalex.org/W4294904666,"Increased levels of proteases, such as trypsin, in the distal intestine have been implicated in intestinal pathological conditions1-3. However, the players and mechanisms that underlie protease regulation in the intestinal lumen have remained unclear. Here we show that Paraprevotella strains isolated from the faecal microbiome of healthy human donors are potent trypsin-degrading commensals. Mechanistically, Paraprevotella recruit trypsin to the bacterial surface through type IX secretion system-dependent polysaccharide-anchoring proteins to promote trypsin autolysis. Paraprevotella colonization protects IgA from trypsin degradation and enhances the effectiveness of oral vaccines against Citrobacter rodentium. Moreover, Paraprevotella colonization inhibits lethal infection with murine hepatitis virus-2, a mouse coronavirus that is dependent on trypsin and trypsin-like proteases for entry into host cells4,5. Consistently, carriage of putative genes involved in trypsin degradation in the gut microbiome was associated with reduced severity of diarrhoea in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, trypsin-degrading commensal colonization may contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and protection from pathogen infection."
https://openalex.org/W4294904999,"Monoterpenes (C10H16) are emitted in large quantities by vegetation to the atmosphere (>100 TgC year-1), where they readily react with hydroxyl radicals and ozone to form new particles and, hence, clouds, affecting the Earth's radiative budget and, thereby, climate change1-3. Although most monoterpenes exist in two chiral mirror-image forms termed enantiomers, these (+) and (-) forms are rarely distinguished in measurement or modelling studies4-6. Therefore, the individual formation pathways of monoterpene enantiomers in plants and their ecological functions are poorly understood. Here we present enantiomerically separated atmospheric monoterpene and isoprene data from an enclosed tropical rainforest ecosystem in the absence of ultraviolet light and atmospheric oxidation chemistry, during a four-month controlled drought and rewetting experiment7. Surprisingly, the emitted enantiomers showed distinct diel emission peaks, which responded differently to progressive drying. Isotopic labelling established that vegetation emitted mainly de novo-synthesized (-)-α-pinene, whereas (+)-α-pinene was emitted from storage pools. As drought progressed, the source of (-)-α-pinene emissions shifted to storage pools, favouring cloud formation. Pre-drought mixing ratios of both α-pinene enantiomers correlated better with other monoterpenes than with each other, indicating different enzymatic controls. These results show that enantiomeric distribution is key to understanding the underlying processes driving monoterpene emissions from forest ecosystems and predicting atmospheric feedbacks in response to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W4294884566,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to noninvasively monitor aquatic animals in freshwater and coastal areas. However, the use of eDNA in the open ocean (hereafter referred to OceanDNA) is still limited because of the sparse distribution of eDNA in the open ocean. Small pelagic fish have a large biomass and are widely distributed in the open ocean. We tested the performance of two OceanDNA analysis methods-species-specific qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and MiFish metabarcoding using universal primers-to determine the distribution of small pelagic fish in the open ocean. We focused on six small pelagic fish species (Sardinops melanostictus, Engraulis japonicus, Scomber japonicus, Scomber australasicus, Trachurus japonicus, and Cololabis saira) and selected the Kuroshio Extension area as a testbed, because distribution of the selected species is known to be influenced by the strong frontal structure. The results from OceanDNA methods were compared to those of net sampling to test for consistency. Then, we compared the detection performance in each target fish between the using of qPCR and MiFish methods. A positive correlation was evident between the qPCR and MiFish detection results. In the ranking of the species detection rates and spatial distribution estimations, comparable similarity was observed between results derived from the qPCR and MiFish methods. In contrast, the detection rate using the qPCR method was always higher than that of the MiFish method. Amplification bias on non-target DNA and low sample DNA quantity seemed to partially result in a lower detection rate for the MiFish method; the reason is still unclear. Considering the ability of MiFish to detect large numbers of species and the quantitative nature of qPCR, the combined usage of the two methods to monitor quantitative distribution of small pelagic fish species with information of fish community structures was recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4294884624,"The COVID-19 pandemic abruptly changed the classroom context and presented enormous challenges for all actors in the educational process, who had to overcome multiple difficulties and incorporate new strategies and tools to construct new knowledge. In this work we analyze how student performance was affected, for a particular case of higher education in La Plata, Argentina. We developed an analytical model for the knowledge acquisition process, based on a series of surveys and information on academic performance in both contexts: face-to-face (before the onset of the pandemic) and virtual (during confinement) with 173 students during 2019 and 2020. The information collected allowed us to construct an adequate representation of the process that takes into account the main contributions common to all individuals. We analyzed the significance of the model by means of Artificial Neural Networks and a Multiple Linear Regression Method. We found that the virtual context produced a decrease in motivation to learn. Moreover, the emerging network of contacts built from the interaction between peers reveals different structures in both contexts. In all cases, interaction with teachers turned out to be of the utmost importance in the process of acquiring knowledge. Our results indicate that this process was also strongly influenced by the availability of resources of each student. This reflects the reality of a developing country, which experienced prolonged isolation, giving way to a particular learning context in which we were able to identify key factors that could guide the design of strategies in similar scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4294782829,"Homeostatic plasticity (HP) encompasses a suite of compensatory physiological processes that counteract neuronal perturbations, enabling brain resilience. Currently, we lack a complete description of the homeostatic processes that operate within the mammalian brain. Here, we demonstrate that acute, partial AMPAR-specific antagonism induces potentiation of presynaptic neurotransmitter release in adult hippocampus, a form of compensatory plasticity that is consistent with the expression of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) documented at peripheral synapses. We show that this compensatory plasticity can be induced within minutes, requires postsynaptic NMDARs, and is expressed via correlated increases in dendritic spine volume, active zone area, and docked vesicle number. Further, simultaneous postsynaptic genetic reduction of GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3 in triple heterozygous knockouts induces potentiation of presynaptic release. Finally, induction of compensatory plasticity at excitatory synapses induces a parallel, NMDAR-dependent potentiation of inhibitory transmission, a cross-modal effect consistent with the anti-epileptic activity of AMPAR-specific antagonists used in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4294884149,"Reallocations of time between daily activities such as sleep, sedentary behavior and physical activity are differentially associated with markers of physical, mental and social health. An individual's most desirable allocation of time may differ depending on which outcomes they value most, with these outcomes potentially competing with each other for reallocations. We aimed to develop an interactive app that translates how self-selected time reallocations are associated with multiple health measures. We used data from the Australian Child Health CheckPoint study (n = 1685, 48% female, 11-12 y), with time spent in daily activities derived from a validated 24-h recall instrument, %body fat from bioelectric impedance, psychosocial health from the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and academic performance (writing) from national standardized tests. We created a user-interface to the compositional isotemporal substitution model with interactive sliders that can be manipulated to self-select time reallocations between activities. The time-use composition was significantly associated with body fat percentage (F = 2.66, P < .001), psychosocial health (F = 4.02, P < .001), and academic performance (F = 2.76, P < .001). Dragging the sliders on the app shows how self-selected time reallocations are associated with the health measures. For example, reallocating 60 minutes from screen time to physical activity was associated with -0.8 [95% CI -1.0 to -0.5] %body fat, +1.9 [1.4 to 2.5] psychosocial score and +4.5 [1.8 to 7.2] academic performance. Our app allows the health associations of time reallocations to be compared against each other. Interactive interfaces provide flexibility in selecting which time reallocations to investigate, and may transform how research findings are disseminated."
https://openalex.org/W4294883966,"The domestication of plants and the origin of agricultural societies has been the focus of much theoretical discussion on why, how, when, and where these happened. The 'when' and 'where' have been substantially addressed by different branches of archaeology, thanks to advances in methodology and the broadening of the geographical and chronological scope of evidence. However, the 'why' and 'how' have lagged behind, holding on to relatively old models with limited explanatory power. Armed with the evidence now available, we can return to theory by revisiting the mechanisms allegedly involved, disentangling their connection to the diversity of trajectories, and identifying the weight and role of the parameters involved. We present the Human-Plant Coevolution (HPC) model, which represents the dynamics of coevolution between a human and a plant population. The model consists of an ecological positive feedback system (mutualism), which can be reinforced by positive evolutionary feedback (coevolution). The model formulation is the result of wiring together relatively simple simulation models of population ecology and evolution, through a computational implementation in R. The HPC model captures a variety of potential scenarios, though which conditions are linked to the degree and timing of population change and the intensity of selective pressures. Our results confirm that the possible trajectories leading to neolithisation are diverse and involve multiple factors. However, simulations also show how some of those factors are entangled, what are their effects on human and plant populations under different conditions, and what might be the main causes fostering agriculture and domestication."
https://openalex.org/W4294884552,"A growing number of studies suggest that climate may impact the spread of COVID-19. This hypothesis is supported by data from similar viral contagions, such as SARS and the 1918 Flu Pandemic, and corroborated by US influenza data. However, the extent to which climate may affect COVID-19 transmission rates and help modeling COVID-19 risk is still not well understood. This study demonstrates that such an understanding is attainable through the development of regression models that verify how climate contributes to modeling COVID-19 transmission, and the use of feature importance techniques that assess the relative weight of meteorological variables compared to epidemiological, socioeconomic, environmental, and global health factors. The ensuing results show that meteorological factors play a key role in regression models of COVID-19 risk, with ultraviolet radiation (UV) as the main driver. These results are corroborated by statistical correlation analyses and a panel data fixed-effect model confirming that UV radiation coefficients are significantly negatively correlated with COVID-19 transmission rates."
https://openalex.org/W4294884585,"An important task for the law enforcement is to assess the accuracy of eyewitness testimonies. Recent research show that indicators of effortful memory retrieval, such as pausing and hedging (e.g. ""I think"", ""maybe""), are more common in incorrect recall. However, a limitation in these studies is that participants are interviewed shortly after witnessing an event, as opposed to after greater retention intervals. We set out to mitigate this shortcoming by investigating the retrieval effort-accuracy relationship over time. In this study, participants watched a staged crime and were interviewed directly afterwards, and two weeks later. Half the participants also carried out a repetition task during the two-week retention interval. Results showed that the retrieval-effort cues Delays and Hedges predicted accuracy at both sessions, including after repetition. We also measured confidence, and found that confidence also predicted accuracy over time, although repetition led to increased confidence for incorrect memories. Moreover, retrieval-effort cues partially mediated between accuracy and confidence."

Methods We enrolled ischemic stroke patients with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale of ≤5. END was defined as worsening of ≥1 point in motor power or ≥2 points in total score. BPV was calculated with BP measured during the first 5 days and presented as standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CoV). Renal function was classified using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification of CKD. Variables were compared between those with (KDIGO classification: moderate- to very-high-risk) and without renal impairment (KDIGO classification: low-risk) and factors associated with END were investigated. Results Among the 290 patients (136 [46.9%] renal impairment), END was observed in 59 (20.3%) patients. BPV parameters and the risk of END increased as renal function was impaired. Renal function and systolic BP (SBP) mean, SD, CoV, and diastolic BP (DBP) mean, SD were independently associated with END. We found no association between BPV parameters and END in normal renal function patients; however, among impaired renal function patients, SBP SD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09–1.32, P &lt;0.001) and CoV (1.30 [1.12–1.50], P &lt;0.001) were associated with END. Conclusions The association between END and BPV parameters differs according to renal function in minor ischemic stroke; BPV was associated with END in patients with renal impairment, but less in those with normal renal function."
https://openalex.org/W4294883989,"Background Data Sharing is widely recognised as crucial for accelerating scientific research and improving its quality. However, data sharing is still not a common practice. Funding agencies tend to facilitate the sharing of research data by both providing incentives and requiring data sharing as part of their policies and conditions for awarding grants. The goal of our article is to answer the following question: What challenges do international funding agencies see when it comes to their own efforts to foster and implement data sharing through their policies? Methods We conducted a series of sixteen guideline-based expert interviews with representatives of leading international funding agencies. As contact persons for open science at their respective agencies, they offered their perspectives and experiences concerning their organisations’ data sharing policies. We performed a qualitative content analysis of the interviews and categorised the challenges perceived by funding agencies. Results We identify and illustrate six challenges surrounding data sharing policies as perceived by leading funding agencies: The design of clear policies, monitoring of compliance, sanctions for non-compliance, incentives, support, and limitations for funders’ own capabilities. However, our interviews also show how funders approach potential solutions to overcome these challenges, for example by coordinating with other agencies or adjusting grant evaluation metrics to incentivise data sharing. Discussion and conclusion Our interviews point to existing flaws in funders’ data sharing policies, such as a lack of clarity, a lack of monitoring of funded researchers’ data sharing behaviour, and a lack of incentives. A number of agencies could suggest potential solutions but often struggle with the overall complexity of data sharing and the implementation of these measures. Funders cannot solve each challenge by themselves, but they can play an active role and lead joint efforts towards a culture of data sharing."
https://openalex.org/W4294884311,"More substantial information on recovery after Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission is urgently needed. In a previous retrospective study, the proportion of non-recovery patients was 44%. The aim of this prospective follow-up study was to evaluate changes in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in the first year after ICU-admission.Long-stay adult ICU-patients (≥ 48 hours) were included. HRQoL was evaluated with the Dutch translation of the RAND-36 item Health Survey (RAND-36) at baseline via proxy measurement, and at three, six, and twelve months after ICU admission. Subsequently, the relation between physical functioning, healthcare utilisation, and work activities was explored.A total of 81 patients were included in this study. Fifty-five percent of patients did not meet criteria for full recovery and were allocated to the Non Recovery (NR)-group (Physical Functioning domain-score: 35 [15-55]). Baseline physical HRQoL differed significantly between the Recovery (R) and NR-group. Patients in the NR-group received home care more often and had higher healthcare utilisation (44 versus 17% in the first three months post-ICU, p = 0.013). Only fourteen percent of NR-patients were able to participate in work activities. Moreover, NR-patients persistently showed impaired overall HRQoL throughout the year after critical illness.Limited recovery in ICU survivors is reflected in overall impaired HRQoL, as well as in far-reaching consequences for patients' healthcare needs and their ability to reintegrate into society. In our study, baseline HRQoL appeared to be an important predictor of long-term outcomes, but not Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score. And, (proxy-derived) HRQoL may help to identify patients at risk of long-term non-recovery."
https://openalex.org/W4294884591,"Circular RNA (circRNA) is a noncoding RNA class with important implications for gene expression regulation, mostly by interaction with other RNA species or RNA-binding proteins. While the commonly applied short-read Illumina RNA-sequencing techniques can be used to detect circRNAs, their full sequence is not revealed. However, the complete sequence information is needed to analyze potential interactions and thus the mechanism of action of circRNAs. Here, we present an improved protocol to enrich and sequence full-length circRNAs by using the Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing platform. The protocol involves an enrichment of lowly abundant circRNAs by exonuclease treatment and negative selection of linear RNAs. Then, a cDNA library is created and amplified by PCR. This protocol provides enough material for several sequencing runs. The library is used as input for ligation-based sequencing together with native barcoding. Stringent quality control of the libraries is ensured by a combination of Qubit, Fragment Analyzer and qRT-PCR. Multiplexing of up to 4 libraries yields in total more than 1–2 Million reads per library, of which 1–2% are circRNA-specific reads with &gt;99% of them full-length. The protocol works well with human cancer cell lines. We further provide suggestions for the bioinformatic analysis of the created data, as well as the limitations of our approach together with recommendations for troubleshooting and interpretation. Taken together, this protocol enables reliable full-length analysis of circRNAs, a noncoding RNA type involved in a growing number of physiologic and pathologic conditions.

https://openalex.org/W4294884635,"The selection of dialysate calcium concentration (D-Ca) is still controversial among chronic hemodialysis (HD) regimens. We examined the trajectories of CKD MBD parameters among the J-DAVID trial participants to see the effect of D-Ca and alfacalcidol. The trial was an open-label randomized clinical trial including 976 HD patients with intact PTH of 180 pg/mL or lower which compared the users of vitamin D receptor activator (oral alfacalcidol) and non-users over a median of 4 years. The main D-Ca used at baseline were 3.0 mEq/L in 70% and 2.5 mEq/L in 25%, respectively. The primary endpoint was the composite of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events and the secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses in which D-Ca was included as a possible effect modifier and serum laboratory data as time-varying covariates showed no significant effect modification for composite cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality. This post hoc analysis showed that the effects of alfacalcidol on cardiovascular outcomes were not significantly modified by D-Ca."
https://openalex.org/W4294884695,"Disease activity status described at fixed time points does not accurately reflect disease course in chronic and relapsing diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We described longitudinal disease activity trajectories in early and established RA.Patients with available 28-Joint Disease Activity Score-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) over two years were included. Using latent growth curve modelling (LCGM), subgroups of patients following distinct patterns were identified.1920 patients were included with 34.4% in early RA (< 2 years' disease duration). Three subgroups were identified using DAS28-ESR in early RA: 1) low disease activity to remission (LDA-REM: 19.1%); 2) moderate disease to remission (MD-REM: 54%); 3) high to moderate disease (HD-MD: 26.9%). The HD-MD group had a significantly higher number of comorbidities, biologic and steroid use and lower post-secondary education. Using CDAI, we identified seven subgroups with only 1.9% remission in early RA. In established RA, seven subgroups were identified using either DAS28-ESR or CDAI. Using DAS28-ESR 27.8% with HD showed improvement in disease status (14.2% HD-REM, 10.3% HD-LDA and 3.3% HD-MD) while using CDAI 17.9% showed improvement.Disease course was different in early and established RA. Only 14.2% of established RA reached DAS28-ESR remission compared to 73.1% of early RA. Using CDAI only 1.9% of early RA and none of the established RA achieved remission, likely reflecting the impact of the patient global assessment on this score. Findings also illustrate the impact of sociodemographic characteristics and early treatment on disease course."
https://openalex.org/W4294883980,"The fully aquatic African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, has an unusual and highly adapted nose that allows it to separately sample both airborne and waterborne stimuli. The function of the adult water nose has received little study, despite the fact that it is quite likely to receive information about conspecifics through secretions released into the water and could aid the frog in making decisions about social and reproductive behaviors. To assess the potential for chemical communication in this species, we developed an in situ electroolfactogram preparation and tested the olfactory responses of adult males to cloacal fluids and skin secretions from male and female conspecifics. We found robust olfactory responses to all conspecific stimuli, with greatest sensitivity to female cloacal fluids. These results open the door to further testing to identify compounds within cloacal fluids and skin secretions that are driving these responses and examine behavioral responses to those compounds. Understanding the role of chemical communication in social and reproductive behaviors may add to our rich understanding of vocal communication to create a more complete picture of social behavior in this species."

Risk factors for overweight and obesity have been studied but there is a lack of information regarding risk factors for abdominal obesity, especially in the preschool population. The aim of the present study was to examine early life risk factors for an increased waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in children at five years of age and, in addition, to investigate if these risk factors also were associated with overweight or obesity. Subjects/Methods The study population comprised 1,540 children from a population-based longitudinal birth cohort study that included 2,666 Swedish children. The children were included if they had complete growth data for the analyses used in this study. Children were classified as having WHtR standard deviation scores (SDS) ≥ 1 or &lt; 1 at five years of age, according to Swedish reference values, and as having body mass index standard deviation scores (BMI SDS ) for overweight/obesity, or normal weight/underweight according to the International Obesity Task Force criteria. Associations between child-related, socioeconomic status-related, parental health-related and nutrition- and feeding practice-related factors during the first two years and a WHtR SDS ≥ 1 or a BMI SDS for overweight/obesity at five years were investigated with logistic regression analyses. Results At five years of age, 15% of the children had WHtR SDS ≥ 1 and 11% had overweight or obesity. In multivariable analyses, rapid weight gain (RWG) during 0–6 months (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.23–2.95, p = 0.004), maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (1.06, 1.01–1.11, p = 0.019) and paternal BMI (1.11, 1.01–1.21, p = 0.028) were associated with WHtR SDS ≥ 1. RWG during 0–6 months (2.53, 1.53–4.20, p&lt;0.001), 6–12 months (2.82, 1.37–5.79, p = 0.005), and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (1.11, 1.06–1.17, p&lt;0.001) were associated with overweight or obesity. Conclusions Early risk factors, including rapid weight gain, are associated with increased WHtR SDS and overweight or obesity at 5 years of age. Preventive interventions should target early RWG and parental overweight and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4294884464,"Sri Lanka is a biologically diverse South Asian island, and together with the Western Ghats (Southern India) is one of the 36 world's most biologically diverse areas. Here, we investigated the origin and diversification of Rhomphaea and Neospintharus of Sri Lanka using sequences of three genes: mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and 16S rRNA (16S); and nuclear 28S rRNA (28S). Our phylogeny included 32 taxa (30 ingroup and 2 outgroup). We used Bayesian Inference and maximum likelihood methods to reconstruct the placement of species, divergence time estimations and their foraging behavior with an emphasis on species from Sri Lanka. Our phylogenetic hypothesis support the monophyly of Argyrodinae as well as the monophyly of Rhomphaea, where Rhomphaea is a sister group of Neospintharus. Further, our analysis also suggests that Sri Lanka was colonized by Argyrodinae several times. Additionally, the following new species are described: Rhomphaea shanthi sp. nov., Rhomphaea jacko sp. nov., Rhomphaea martini sp. nov., Rhomphaea marani sp. nov., Neospintharus kandelensis sp. nov. and Neospintharus ohiyiaensis sp. nov."
https://openalex.org/W4294884507,"The disruptive potentials of drones are rapidly growing including for the delivery of blood samples in healthcare. Maintenance of the quality of blood samples is important to ascertain that the drone is a safe mode of transportation, particularly during emergencies and in critical cases. The influence of the drone carriage material on blood samples transportation was investigated in this study. Two phases of drone simulation flights were conducted in Cyberjaya, Malaysia. In Phase 1, the effect of drone carriage material on the internal storage temperature during blood samples transportation was determined. Three types of carriage materials were compared: aluminium, expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam, and polypropylene (PP) plastic. In Phase 2, the quality of drone-transported blood samples was assessed, using the best material from Phase 1 as the drone carriage material. Biochemical and hematological analyses of 60 blood samples were conducted using five parameters. In Phase 1, EPS foam was found to be the best material to maintain a stable and favorable internal storage temperature at mean kinetic temperature ±SD of 4.70 ±1.14°C. Much higher and unfavorable mean kinetic temperatures were recorded for aluminium (11.46 ±0.35°C) and plastic (14.17 ±0.05°C). In Phase 2, laboratory tests show that the quality of blood samples was well maintained, and the mean biochemical and hematological parameters of drone-transported blood samples showed no significant alteration compared to ground controls. Drone carriage material is an important determinant of the quality of blood samples transported by drone, particularly in hot equatorial climates as in Malaysia. The blood storage temperature was best maintained using EPS foam, as evidenced by the favorable average temperature and preservation of hematological and biochemical parameters of the blood samples."
https://openalex.org/W4294884553,"This paper analyses the interaction between the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), unemployment rate, stock market, consumer confidence index (CCI), and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index in China within a time-frequency framework. We compare the changes in economic indicators during the global financial crisis (GFC) and study the different impacts of the two events on China’s economy. An unprecedented impact of COVID-19 shocks on the unemployment rate, CCI, EPU index, and stock market volatility over the low frequency bands is uncovered by applying the coherence wavelet method to China monthly data. The COVID-19 effect on the stock market volatility and the EPU index is substantially higher than on the unemployment rate and the CCI. On the contrary, the GFC’s impact on the unemployment rate is much greater than that on the EPU index and CCI. Additionally, the impact of the GFC on the economy is more cyclical in the long-term, while the COVID-19 pandemic is a short-term shock with a relatively short oscillation cycle. This study concludes that the economic impact of COVID-19 will not spread into a financial crisis for China and believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is more of a health event than an economic crisis for Chinese economy."
https://openalex.org/W4294884631,"When studying financial markets, we often look at estimating a correlation matrix from asset returns. These tend to be noisy, with many more dimensions than samples, so often the resulting correlation matrix is filtered. Popular methods to do this include the minimum spanning tree, planar maximally filtered graph and the triangulated maximally filtered graph, which involve using the correlation network as the adjacency matrix of a graph and then using tools from graph theory. These assume the data fits some form of shape. We do not necessarily have a reason to believe that the data does fit into this shape, and there have been few empirical investigations comparing how the methods perform. In this paper we look at how the filtered networks are changed from the original networks using stock returns from the US, UK, German, Indian and Chinese markets, and at how these methods affect our ability to distinguish between datasets created from different correlation matrices using a graph embedding algorithm. We find that the relationship between the full and filtered networks depends on the data and the state of the market, and decreases as we increase the size of networks, and that the filtered networks do not provide an improvement in classification accuracy compared to the full networks."
https://openalex.org/W4294884655,"The continued urbanization poses several challenges for law enforcement agencies to ensure a safe and secure environment. Countries are spending a substantial amount of their budgets to control and prevent crime. However, limited efforts have been made in the crime prediction area due to the deficiency of spatiotemporal crime data. Several machine learning, deep learning, and time series analysis techniques are exploited, but accuracy issues prevail. Thus, this study proposed a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Exponential Smoothing (ES) hybrid for crime forecasting. The proposed technique is evaluated using New York City crime data from 2010-2017. The proposed approach outperformed as compared to state-of-the-art Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) with low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) (0.3738, 0.3891, 0.3433,0.3964), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)(13.146, 13.669, 13.104, 13.77), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (9.837, 10.896, 10.598, 10.721). Therefore, the proposed technique can help law enforcement agencies to prevent and control crime by forecasting crime patterns."

https://openalex.org/W4294884661,"Prostate cancer diagnosis and focal laser ablation treatment both require the insertion of a needle for biopsy and optical fibre positioning. Needle insertion in soft tissues may cause tissue motion and deformation, which can, in turn, result in tissue damage and needle positioning errors. In this study, we present a prototype system making use of a wasp-inspired (bioinspired) self-propelled needle, which is able to move forward with zero external push force, thereby avoiding large tissue motion and deformation. Additionally, the actuation system solely consists of 3D printed parts and is therefore safe to use inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The needle consists of six parallel 0.25-mm diameter Nitinol rods driven by the actuation system. In the prototype, the self-propelled motion is achieved by advancing one needle segment while retracting the others. The advancing needle segment has to overcome a cutting and friction force while the retracting needle segments experience a friction force in the opposite direction. The needle self-propels through the tissue when the friction force of the five retracting needle segments overcomes the sum of the friction and cutting forces of the advancing needle segment. We tested the performance of the prototype in ex vivo human prostate tissue inside a preclinical MRI system in terms of the slip ratio of the needle with respect to the prostate tissue. The results showed that the needle was visible in MR images and that the needle was able to self-propel through the tissue with a slip ratio in the range of 0.78-0.95. The prototype is a step toward self-propelled needles for MRI-guided transperineal laser ablation as a method to treat prostate cancer."

In the ageing population, health problems, and health care utilization should be assessed carefully and addressed. This study aimed to identify chronic morbidities, health problems, health care seeking behaviour and health care utilization among the elderly.We conducted a community based, cross-sectional study in urban areas of the Sunsari district using face-to-face interviews. A total of 530 elderly participants were interviewed and selected by a simple proportionate random sampling technique.About half, 48.3%, elderly were suffering from pre-existing chronic morbidities, of which, 30.9% had single morbidity, and 17.4% had multi-morbidities. This study unfurled more than 50.0% prevalence of health ailments like circulatory, digestive, eye, musculoskeletal and psychological problems each representing the burden of 68.7%, 68.3%, 66.2%, 65.8% and 55.7% respectively. Our study also found that 58.7% preferred hospitals as their first contact facility. Despite the preferences, 46.0% reported visiting traditional healers for treatment of their ailments. About 68.1% reported having difficulty seeking health care and 51.1% reported visits to a health care facility within the last 6 months period. The participants with pre-existing morbidity, health insurance, and an economic status above the poverty line were more likely to visit health care facilities.Elderly people had a higher prevalence of health ailments, but unsatisfactory health care seeking and health care utilization behaviour. These need further investigation and attention by the public health system in order to provide appropriate curative and preventive health care to the elderly. There is an urgent need to promote geriatric health services and make them available at the primary health care level, the first level of contact with a national health system."
