https://openalex.org/W2604650781,"Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. The mechanism(s) by which mutant HTT (mHTT) causes disease is unclear. Nucleocytoplasmic transport, the trafficking of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, is tightly regulated by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) made up of nucleoporins (NUPs). Previous studies offered clues that mHTT may disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport and a mutation of an NUP can cause HD-like pathology. Therefore, we evaluated the NPC and nucleocytoplasmic transport in multiple models of HD, including mouse and fly models, neurons transfected with mHTT, HD iPSC-derived neurons, and human HD brain regions. These studies revealed severe mislocalization and aggregation of NUPs and defective nucleocytoplasmic transport. HD repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation proteins also disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport. Additionally, overexpression of NUPs and treatment with drugs that prevent aberrant NUP biology also mitigated this transport defect and neurotoxicity, providing future novel therapy targets."
https://openalex.org/W2604515236,"The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic reactions. Generally, these reactions are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (~284 electron volts) on a tabletop apparatus to directly reveal the valence electronic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence orbital energy levels. We show that this transient valence electronic structure arises within 60 ± 20 fs after ultraviolet photoexcitation and decays with a time constant of 110 ± 60 fs."

https://openalex.org/W2605313567,"New tungsten isotope data for modern ocean island basalts (OIB) from Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland reveal variable 182W/184W, ranging from that of the ambient upper mantle to ratios as much as 18 parts per million lower. The tungsten isotopic data negatively correlate with 3He/4He. These data indicate that each OIB system accesses domains within Earth that formed within the first 60 million years of solar system history. Combined isotopic and chemical characteristics projected for these ancient domains indicate that they contain metal and are repositories of noble gases. We suggest that the most likely source candidates are mega-ultralow-velocity zones, which lie beneath Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland but not beneath hot spots whose OIB yield normal 182W and homogeneously low 3He/4He."
https://openalex.org/W2605115788,"In schizophrenia, brain-wide alterations have been identified at the molecular and cellular levels, yet how these phenomena affect cortical circuit activity remains unclear. We studied two mouse models of schizophrenia-relevant disease processes: chronic ketamine (KET) administration and Df(16)A+/-, modeling 22q11.2 microdeletions, a genetic variant highly penetrant for schizophrenia. Local field potential recordings in visual cortex confirmed gamma-band abnormalities similar to patient studies. Two-photon calcium imaging of local cortical populations revealed in both models a deficit in the reliability of neuronal coactivity patterns (ensembles), which was not a simple consequence of altered single-neuron activity. This effect was present in ongoing and sensory-evoked activity and was not replicated by acute ketamine administration or pharmacogenetic parvalbumin-interneuron suppression. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that schizophrenia is an ""attractor"" disease and demonstrate that degraded neuronal ensembles are a common consequence of diverse genetic, cellular, and synaptic alterations seen in chronic schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2604170318,"The basal ganglia (BG) integrate inputs from diverse sensorimotor, limbic, and associative regions to guide action-selection and goal-directed behaviors. The entopeduncular nucleus (EP) is a major BG output nucleus and has been suggested to channel signals from distinct BG nuclei to target regions involved in diverse functions. Here we use single-cell transcriptional and molecular analyses to demonstrate that the EP contains at least three classes of projection neurons-glutamate/GABA co-releasing somatostatin neurons, glutamatergic parvalbumin neurons, and GABAergic parvalbumin neurons. These classes comprise functionally and anatomically distinct output pathways that differentially affect EP target regions, such as the lateral habenula (LHb) and thalamus. Furthermore, LHb- and thalamic-projecting EP neurons are differentially innervated by subclasses of striatal and pallidal neurons. Therefore, we identify previously unknown subdivisions within the EP and reveal the existence of cascading, molecularly distinct projections through striatum and globus pallidus to EP targets within epithalamus and thalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2605052627,"The perception of visual motion is critical for animal navigation, and flies are a prominent model system for exploring this neural computation. In Drosophila, the T4 cells of the medulla are directionally selective and necessary for ON motion behavioral responses. To examine the emergence of directional selectivity, we developed genetic driver lines for the neuron types with the most synapses onto T4 cells. Using calcium imaging, we found that these neuron types are not directionally selective and that selectivity arises in the T4 dendrites. By silencing each input neuron type, we identified which neurons are necessary for T4 directional selectivity and ON motion behavioral responses. We then determined the sign of the connections between these neurons and T4 cells using neuronal photoactivation. Our results indicate a computational architecture for motion detection that is a hybrid of classic theoretical models."

When well-ordered crystals are not available for x-ray analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most common structure-elucidation method. However, sometimes it is hard to distinguish isomers with similar spectra. Liu et al. showcase a protocol that combines computer modeling with anisotropic NMR data acquired using gel-aligned samples. Because of its uniform sensitivity to relative bond orientations across the whole molecular framework, the method overcomes common pitfalls that can lead to invalid structure assignments.

https://openalex.org/W2604969293,"A tailored look at behavioral pharmacology It is important to understand how animal behavior is mediated by molecular, cellular, and circuit components of the brain. However, it has been difficult to link the activity of specific molecules in defined cells to behavioral roles. Shields et al. developed an approach to deconstruct behavioral neuropharmacology with cellular specificity. The technique, termed DART (drugs acutely restricted by tethering), uses enzymatic capture to restrict standard drugs to the surface of genetically specified cells without prior modification of the native pharmacological target. The method provides cell-type specificity, endogenous-protein specificity, acute onset, and utility in behaving animals. This enables the activity of specific molecules in defined circuit elements to be causally linked to behavior. Science , this issue p. eaaj2161"
https://openalex.org/W2604354579,"Olfactory oscillations are pervasive throughout vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Such observations have long implied that rhythmic activity patterns play a fundamental role in odor coding. Using intracranial EEG recordings from rare patients with medically resistant epilepsy, we find that theta oscillations are a distinct electrophysiological signature of olfactory processing in the human brain. Across seven patients, odor stimulation enhanced theta power in human piriform cortex, with robust effects at the level of single trials. Importantly, classification analysis revealed that piriform oscillatory activity conveys olfactory-specific information that can be decoded within 110-518 ms of a sniff, and maximally within the theta frequency band. This temporal window was also associated with increased theta-specific phase coupling between piriform cortex and hippocampus. Together these findings suggest that human piriform cortex has access to olfactory content in the time-frequency domain and can utilize these signals to rapidly differentiate odor stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2950857505,"The growth factor and cytokine regulated transcription factor STAT3 is required for the self-renewal of several stem cell types including tumor stem cells from glioblastoma. Here we show that STAT3 inhibition leads to the upregulation of the histone H3K27me2/3 demethylase Jmjd3 (KDM6B), which can reverse polycomb complex-mediated repression of tissue specific genes. STAT3 binds to the Jmjd3 promoter, suggesting that Jmjd3 is a direct target of STAT3. Overexpression of Jmjd3 slows glioblastoma stem cell growth and neurosphere formation, whereas knockdown of Jmjd3 rescues the STAT3 inhibitor-induced neurosphere formation defect. Consistent with this observation, STAT3 inhibition leads to histone H3K27 demethylation of neural differentiation genes, such as Myt1, FGF21, and GDF15. These results demonstrate that the regulation of Jmjd3 by STAT3 maintains repression of differentiation specific genes and is therefore important for the maintenance of self-renewal of normal neural and glioblastoma stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2604542316,"During development of the central nervous system, there is a shift in the subunit composition of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) resulting in a dramatic acceleration of NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents. This shift coincides with upregulation of the GluN2A subunit and triheteromeric GluN1/2A/2B receptors with fast deactivation kinetics, whereas expression of diheteromeric GluN1/2B receptors with slower deactivation kinetics is decreased. Here, we show that allosteric interactions occur between the glutamate-binding GluN2 subunits in triheteromeric GluN1/2A/2B NMDARs. This allosterism is dominated by the GluN2A subunit and results in functional properties not predicted by those of diheteromeric GluN1/2A and GluN1/2B NMDARs. These findings suggest that GluN1/2A/2B NMDARs may maintain some signaling properties of the GluN2B subunit while having the kinetic properties of GluN1/2A NMDARs and highlight the complexity in NMDAR signaling created by diversity in subunit composition."

Questionnaires were applied at the beginning of the semester aimed to outline the demographic profile of the students. Their grade in the course was evaluated to determine their performance. The Module 1 (Information on Medication) average on the campus-based was 7.1225 and on DE was 7.5519, (p = 0.117). The Module 2 (Pharmaceutical Services) average on the campus-based was 7.1595 and on distance education was 7.7025, (p = 0.027*). There was a difference in learning outcomes in the Pharmaceutical Care Course between face-to-face and distant education. Therefore, the student performance was better in the distance education module, indicating distance education can be satisfactorily used in Pharmacy Programs."
https://openalex.org/W2604324079,"Although being one of the few drought-tolerant plants, mango trees are irrigated to ensure optimum and consistent productivity in China. In order to better understand the effects of soil water content on mango yield and fruit quality at fruit growth stage, irrigation experiments were investigated and the object was to determine the soil water content criteria at which growth and quality of mango would be optimal based on soil water measured by RHD-JS water-saving irrigation system through micro-sprinkling irrigation. Five soil water content treatments (relative to the percentage of field water capacity) for irrigation (T1:79%-82%, T2:75%-78%, T3:71%-74%, T4: 65%-70%, T5:63%-66%) were compared in 2013. Amount of applied irrigation water for different treatments varied from 2.93m3 to 1.08 m3. The results showed that mango fruit production and quality at fruit growth stage were significantly affected under different irrigation water amounts. Variation in soil water content not only had effects on fruit size, but also on fruit yield. The highest fruit yield and irrigation water use efficiency were obtained from the T4 treatment. Irrigation water amount also affected fruit quality parameters like fruit total soluble solids, soluble sugar, starch, titratable acid and vitamin C content. Comprehensive evaluation of the effect of indexs of correlation on irrigation treatment by subordinate function showed that when the soil moisture content were controlled at about 65-70% of the field water moisture capacity, water demand in the growth and development of mango could be ensured, and maximum production efficiency of irrigation and the best quality of fruit could be achieved. In conclusion, treatment T4 was the optimum irrigation schedule for growing mango, thus achieving efficient production of mango in consideration of the compromise among mango yield, fruit quality and water use efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2604152636,"Drip irrigation is a means of distributing the exact amount of water a plant needs by dripping water directly onto the root zone. It can produce up to 90% more crops than rain-fed irrigation, and reduce water consumption by 70% compared to conventional flood irrigation. Drip irrigation may enable millions of poor farmers to rise out of poverty by growing more and higher value crops, while not contributing to overconsumption of water. Achieving this impact will require broadening the engineering knowledge required to design new, low-cost, low-power drip irrigation technology, particularly for poor, off-grid communities in developing countries. For more than 50 years, pressure compensating (PC) drip emitters-which can maintain a constant flow rate under variations in pressure, to ensure uniform water distribution on a field-have been designed and optimized empirically. This study presents a parametric model that describes the fluid and solid mechanics that govern the behavior of a common PC emitter architecture, which uses a flexible diaphragm to limit flow. The model was validated by testing nine prototypes with geometric variations, all of which matched predicted performance to within R2 = 0.85. This parametric model will enable irrigation engineers to design new drip emitters with attributes that improve performance and lower cost, which will promote the use of drip irrigation throughout the world."
https://openalex.org/W2604830661,"Purpose The rising incidence and life expectancy associated with prostate cancer (PCa) has led to increasing interest in predicting the risk of second primary malignancies (SPMs) among PCa survivors, although data regarding SPMs after PCa are controversial. Methods We identified 30,964 patients from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan who had newly diagnosed PCa between 2000 and 2010. Each patient was randomly frequency-matched with an individual without PCa, based on age, comorbidity, and index year. Competing-risks regression models were used to estimate subhazard ratios (SHRs) of SPMs development associated with PCa. The Bonferroni adjustment was used in multiple comparisons. Results Men with PCa had a trend of lower risk of developing overall SPMs compared to those without PCa (adjusted SHR = 0.94, 99.72% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89–1.00, p = 0.06). The risks of lung and liver cancer were significantly lower. In contrast, these patients had a significantly higher risk of thyroid cancer. There is a trend for a higher risk of developing SPMs in the urinary bladder and rectum/anus. Further analyses indicated that PCa patients who received radiation therapy (RT) had an increased risk of overall SPMs, hematologic malignancies, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, and urinary bladder cancer compared with those who did not receive RT. Conclusion Men with PCa tended to have a lower risk of SPMs, but a significantly higher risk of subsequent thyroid cancer. Continued cancer surveillance is required among PCa survivors, especially in specific sites and in individuals who received RT."

Many enzymes, molecular chaperones, and post-translational modifiers facilitate collagen biosynthesis. Collagen contains a large number of proline residues, so the cis/trans isomerization of proline peptide bonds is the rate-limiting step during triple-helix formation.

We previously described this process as “Ziploc-ing the structure” and now provide additional information on the activity of individual rER PPIases. We investigated the substrate preferences of these PPIases in vitro using type III collagen, the unhydroxylated quarter fragment of type III collagen, and synthetic peptides as substrates. We observed changes in activity of six rER-resident PPIases, cyclophilin B (encoded by the PPIB gene), FKBP13 (FKBP2), FKBP19 (FKBP11), FKBP22 (FKBP14), FKBP23 (FKBP7), and FKBP65 (FKBP10), due to posttranslational modifications of proline residues in the substrate. Cyclophilin B and FKBP13 exhibited much lower activity toward post-translationally modified substrates. In contrast, FKBP19, FKBP22, and FKBP65 showed increased activity toward hydroxyproline-containing peptide substrates. Moreover, FKBP22 showed a hydroxyproline-dependent effect by increasing the amount of refolded type III collagen in vitro and FKBP19 seems to interact with triple helical type I collagen.

Protein folding is a fundamental process in the cells, and a precisely folded protein is required to maintain homeostasis and physiological function in organisms. A large number of various types of molecular chaperones and enzymes exist to actively facilitate folding inside the cell (1Szabadkai G. Rizzuto R. Chaperones as parts of organelle networks.Adv. Exp.

Enzymes recognize a certain amino acid or sequence to transform and bind to folding intermediates, which are termed isomerases and post-translational modifiers, respectively (4Braakman I.

Collagen contains multiple GXY repeats, where X and Y are frequently occupied by proline and 4-hydroxyproline, respectively (8Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. Amino acid propensities for the collagen triple-helix.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14960-14967Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar).

Three chains associate together to form an elongated helix with glycine residues in the inner core, called a triple helix. Formation of the triple helix is initiated at the carboxyl-terminal end in most types of collagen and proceeds toward the amino-terminal end in a zipper-like fashion wherein all proline peptide bonds have to turn into a trans state (10Bächinger H.P.

However, there are no data available to quantitatively compare the levels of enzymatic activities for individual rER-resident PPIases with a particular substrate. Especially, no reports exist on how PPIases behave when the proline-containing peptide substrates are hydroxylated. The FK506-binding protein (FKBP) family proteins contain at least one FKBP domain and have PPIase activity and/or chaperone activity (17Ishikawa Y. Boudko S. Bächinger H.P.

However, the structure-function relationship of this domain is not well established. In this report we measured the circular dichroism (CD) spectra to investigate the structural comparison between FKBPs composed of similar domains and performed in vitro enzyme assays to evaluate the chaperone and isomerase activities of six rER-resident PPIases: cyclophilin B (CypB), FKBP13, FKBP19 (only the FKBP domain), FKBP22, FKBP23, and FKBP65. We also show the PPIase activities toward hydroxyproline-containing substrates and compare differences observed between proline- and hydroxyproline- containing substrates. Fig. 1 shows an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of purified rER-resident PPIases under reducing conditions. The purified FKBP13 (123 amino acids and 13444.5 Da) and FKBP domain of FKBP19 (121 amino acids and 13054.9 Da) are expected to have a similar migration on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel; however, FKBP13 (second lane in Fig. 1) migrates slightly faster than the FKBP domain of FKBP19 (third lane in Fig. 1). This might be caused by the difference in the theoretical pI between 8.93 for FKBP13 and 4.80 for the FKBP domain of FKBP19 (theoretical pIs were calculated using the ProtParam tool provided from ExPASy. In contrast, FKBP22 (200 amino acids, 22845.9 Da, pI 5.28) and FKBP23 (208 amino acids, 23820.7 Da and pI 5.27) migrate similarly (fourth and fifth lanes in Fig. 1). A sequence comparison and alignment between FKBP13 and the FKBP domain of FKBP19 and FKBP22 and FKBP23 are shown in Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1. Fig. 2 shows the CD spectra, and Table 2 describes the predicted secondary structure contents calculated from the CD spectra. To ensure whether the purified proteins folded properly, thermal transition curves were monitored by CD as a function of temperature. The thermal transitions in Fig. 2D show very sharp transitions around 65 °C for FKBP13 and FKBP19, indicating highly cooperative unfolding of the single domain. The transition of FKBP23 shows a broader transition at 60 °C. This could be due to the presence of the EF-hands in addition to the FKBP domain, a lower enthalpy change or folding intermediates. The transition of FKBP22 is even broader, probably due to the same reasons. Fig. 2, D and E, show that these proteins fold into a stable structure around physiological temperatures and the temperatures used in these experiments.Table 1The sequence comparison between FKBPs consisting of similar structural compositionView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Figure 2Circular dichroism measurements of FKBPs.

Open table in a new tab Both FKBP13 and the FKBP domain of FKBP19 consist of a single FKBP domain. Clear differences were shown in both the CD spectra and the predicted secondary structure (Fig. 2A and Table 2). Although the content of α-helix is similar, the FKBP domain of FKBP19 has more β-sheets and turns than FKBP13 (Table 2). The secondary structure of the FKBP domain of FKBP19 is similar to that of FKBP65 (Table 2). This could be reflected in the similarity of the CD spectra of the FKBP domain of FKBP19 that of FKBP65 reported previously (18Ishikawa Y. Vranka J. Wirz J. Nagata K. Bächinger H.P. The rough endoplasmic reticulum-resident FK506-binding protein FKBP65 is a molecular chaperone that interacts with collagens.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31584-31590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both FKBP22 and FKBP23 are composed of one FKBP domain and two EF-hand motifs that bind to a calcium ion. Despite this common structure, they showed slightly different secondary structure contents (Table 2) and CD spectra (Fig. 2B). Some of the EF-hand motifs require a calcium ion to maintain the α-helical structure (19Denessiouk K. Permyakov S. Denesyuk A. Permyakov E. Johnson M.S. Two structural motifs within canonical EF-hand calcium-binding domains identify five different classes of calcium buffers and sensors.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9e109287Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The structure of FKBP23 changes after removing calcium (Fig. 2C), as was shown for FKBP22 previously (20Ishikawa Y. Bächinger H.P.

Chem. 2014; 289: 18189-18201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This suggests that the EF-hand motifs of FKBP22 and FKBP23 are calcium-sensitive structures in the rER. These CD analyses indicate that the FKBP domains can have different structures, which could influence their catalytic activity and substrate specificity. To assess the molecular chaperone activity of FKBP13, the FKBP domain of FKBP19, and FKBP23, we performed two biochemical assays in vitro. Because molecular chaperone activities have been already measured for CypB, FKBP65, and FKBP22 (18Ishikawa Y. Vranka J. Wirz J. Nagata K. Bächinger H.P.

First, we tested a classical molecular chaperone assay, the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase. Only the FKBP domain of FKBP19 prevented aggregation of citrate synthase (Fig. 3A) and showed concentration-dependent inhibition (Fig. 3B). However, this chaperone activity was smaller compared with the positive control PDI (Fig. 3, A and B). Next, to evaluate whether these three FKBPs are involved in collagen quality control, we measured the effect on collagen fibril formation. When collagens are folded into a triple helix in the rER the stability of this newly formed structure is stabilized by the chaperones Hsp47 and FKBP65. This interaction also helps to prevent premature aggregation of these molecules. FKBP13 and FKBP23 did not affect the fibril formation of type I collagen (Fig. 3C). In contrast, in the presence of the FKBP domain of FKBP19 fibril formation of type I collagen was delayed (Fig. 3C), and this delay became larger with increasing concentrations of the FKBP domain of FKBP19 (Fig. 3D). Likewise, the activity was not only much weaker than the positive control decorin (22Islam M. Gor J. Perkins S.J. Ishikawa Y. Bächinger H.P. Hohenester E. The concave face of decorin mediates reversible dimerization and collagen binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 35526-35533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but also FKBP65, as previously reported (18Ishikawa Y. Vranka J. Wirz J. Nagata K. Bächinger H.P.

Chem. 2008; 283: 31584-31590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As we described above, FKBP65 and FKBP19 showed similar CD spectra (Fig. 2A, Table 2, and Ref. 18Ishikawa Y. Vranka J. Wirz J. Nagata K. Bächinger H.P. The rough endoplasmic reticulum-resident FK506-binding protein FKBP65 is a molecular chaperone that interacts with collagens.J. Biol.

The collagen triple helix is formed in a zipper-like fashion, and this folding is accelerated by PPIases. Three rER-resident PPIases, CypB, FKBP65, and FKBP22, were shown to influence the rate of type III collagen refolding in vitro (18Ishikawa Y. Vranka J. Wirz J. Nagata K. Bächinger H.P.

However, it is difficult to compare the level of their activities directly because different experimental conditions were used. Other rER-resident PPIases like FKBP13, FKBP19, and FKBP23 could possibly be involved in collagen folding. Therefore, we tested two enzyme assays using type III collagen and short peptides as substrates to address the effect on collagen folding and the individual level of PPIase activity among six rER-resident PPIases. We prepared two different collagen substrates with and without prolyl 4-hydroxylation and measured type III collagen refolding using CD. The CD signal reflects the rate of collagen refolding from a denatured state because PPIases are stable around physiological temperatures (Fig. 2, D and E), and the CD signals of the PPIases are not changed during the measurements. Two PPIases, the FKBP domains of FKBP19 and FKBP23, did not affect the rate of refolding for either substrate, whereas the other two PPIases, CypB and FKBP65, increased the rate of folding for both (Fig. 4, B and D). CypB had the highest activity for both substrates but did not enhance the amounts of refolded type III collagen (Fig. 4, B and D). On the other hand, FKBP22 clearly improved formation of folded molecules (Fig. 4C), and this observation was reported before (20Ishikawa Y. Bächinger H.P. A substrate preference for the rough endoplasmic reticulum resident protein FKBP22 during collagen biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 18189-18201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The reason for this increase is not currently understood but could be due to specific sequences in type III collagen, and we will investigate this further in the near future. Higher concentrations of FKBP65 were required to detect activity (Fig. 4B), which corresponds to the marginal effect on type III collagen refolding shown previously (24Zeng B. MacDonald J.R. Bann J.G. Beck K. Gambee J.E. Boswell B.A. Bächinger H.P. Chicken FK506-binding protein, FKBP65, a member of the FKBP family of peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases, is only partially inhibited by FK506.Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One interesting observation is the prolyl 4-hydroxylation-dependent difference in substrate recognition between FKBP13 and FKBP22 (Fig. 4). FKBP13 recognizes the unhydroxylated type III collagen but not the hydroxylated collagen, whereas the opposite is true for FKBP22. The increase in the rate of folding of unhydroxylated type III collagen in Fig. 4B is with a lower concentration of CypB (0.5 μm) compared with the concentration of other PPIases (3–6 μm). The concentration of CypB in Fig. 4D is 1.0 μm compared with 1–2 μm for the other PPIases. This shows that CypB prefers unhydroxylated type III collagen as a substrate. Next, we quantitated the level of activity using peptide substrates in a stopped-flow system with an established procedure (25Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C.

We prepared not only short peptides containing proline residues but also peptides containing prolyl 3- and 4-hydroxylation. The general trends in this assay corresponded to the result of type III collagen refolding, and the calculated kcat/Km values are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5. CypB has the highest catalytic activity, and FKBP65 shows decent activities among the six PPIases toward all seven peptide substrates. CypB shows a decreased activity for hydroxyproline-containing peptides; however, CypB still has the highest activity among the six PPIases (see Table 3). The substrate recognition of FKBP13 and FKBP22 depends on the prolyl 4-hydroxylation as found in the type III collagen refolding assay. It is interesting to note that AMC peptides showed larger kcat/Km values than p-nitroanilide (pNa) peptides despite that the concentration of pNa peptides were higher than that of AMC. Additionally, the order of level of activity was slightly altered between AMC and pNa. These compounds may affect the efficiency of the association and the dissociation with the substrate and also of the chymotrypsin activity. However, overall trends of level of PPIase activities are comparable.Table 3The PPIase activities of rER resident PPIases with Suc-AXYF-pNa /AMC peptides as substratesPPleasekcat/KmSuc-AXYF-pNaSuc-AXPF-AMC-AP--AO--LP--LO--GP--GO--GZ--AP--LP-(mm−1·s−1)(mm−1·s−1)Human FKBP1341.0 ± 3.71.47 ± 0.85620 ± 4677.6 ± 23.12.7 ± 1.69.68 ± 4.413.68 ± 2.88383.5 ± 78.41711 ± 340Human FKBP19aHuman FKBP19 is the FKBP domain of FKBP19 in this table.0.23 ± 0.188.41 ± 2.790.59 ± 0.1264.5 ± 36.10.36 ± 0.179.48 ± 4.419.66 ± 2.621.35 ± 0.6235.9 ± 19.1Human FKBP221.13 ± 0.7514.7 ± 3.20.45 ± 0.0917.6 ± 7.30.23 ± 0.1421.8 ± 13.481.1 ± 31.51.3 ± 0.8bFrom Ref. 20.30.7 ± 12.5bFrom Ref. 20.Human FKBP231.36 ± 0.912.31 ± 1.20.87 ± 0.419.75 ± 4.81.44 ± 0.120.87 ± 0.418.3 ± 4.414.5 ± 6.063.0 ± 14.8Chicken FKBP6515.6 ± 1.638.1 ± 5.58.17 ± 2.5930.7 ± 8.67.24 ± 4.624.4 ± 9.620.4 ± 12.3232cFrom Ref. 24.370 ± 66Chicken CypB10839 ± 699217 ± 242516 ± 74117 ± 603178 ± 39349.6 ± 36111 ± 3623,270 ± 5000bFrom Ref. 20.7900 ± 400bFrom Ref. 20.a Human FKBP19 is the FKBP domain of FKBP19 in this table.b From Ref. 20Ishikawa Y.

https://openalex.org/W2604986703,"Neuroendocrine control of reproduction by brain-secreted pulses of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) represents a longstanding puzzle about extracellular signal decoding mechanisms. GnRH regulates the pituitary gonadotropin's follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), both of which are heterodimers specified by unique β subunits (FSHβ/LHβ). Contrary to Lhb, Fshb gene induction has a preference for low-frequency GnRH pulses. To clarify the underlying regulatory mechanisms, we developed three biologically anchored mathematical models: 1) parallel activation of Fshb inhibitory factors (e.g. inhibin α and VGF nerve growth factor-inducible), 2) activation of a signaling component with a refractory period (e.g. G protein), and 3) inactivation of a factor needed for Fshb induction (e.g. growth differentiation factor 9). Simulations with all three models recapitulated the Fshb expression levels obtained in pituitary gonadotrope cells perifused with varying GnRH pulse frequencies. Notably, simulations altering average concentration, pulse duration, and pulse frequency revealed that the apparent frequency-dependent pattern of Fshb expression in model 1 actually resulted from variations in average GnRH concentration. In contrast, models 2 and 3 showed “true” pulse frequency sensing. To resolve which components of this GnRH signal induce Fshb, we developed a high-throughput parallel experimental system. We analyzed over 4,000 samples in experiments with varying near-physiological GnRH concentrations and pulse patterns.

The evolution and function of the multicellular organism depends on intracellular and intercellular communication mediated by biological chemicals. One form of biological information transfer relies on sensing and responding to signaling chemical concentration. The mammalian endocrine system predominantly encodes intercellular communication as chemical concentrations (e.g. in the control of metabolic rate by thyroid hormone). Frequency- and pattern-encoded communication supports much higher-fidelity and -capacity information transfer. The specialized, high-capacity information transfer of the nervous system is associated with stimulus pattern-based electrochemical biological information transfer protocols, such as neurochemically regulated synaptic potentials and the all-or-none action potential. Although the mechanisms of information coding and decoding of many concentration-based biological chemical signals are well understood, the frequency and pulse pattern-signal information transfer protocols are largely unknown. At one key interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system, the hypothalamus controls the reproductive system largely via the release of gonadotropin-release hormone (GnRH) 5The abbreviations used are: GnRHgonadotropin-releasing hormoneLHluteinizing hormoneqPCRquantitative real-time PCRIFinhibitory factor(s)DFdesensitizing stimulatory factorAUarbitrary units. in short discrete pulses that vary in frequency during the reproductive cycle (1Burger L.L.

Pulsatile release of GnRH from specialized hypothalamic neurons orchestrates the biosynthesis and secretion of the pituitary gonadotropin hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which in turn regulate gonadal development and steroidogenesis (1Burger L.L. Haisenleder D.J. Dalkin A.C. Marshall J.C. Regulation of gonadotropin subunit gene transcription.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 33: 559-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Reproductive disorders such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia (Kallmann syndrome) show impaired GnRH pulse secretion and subsequent abnormal FSH and LH levels; treatment with either pulsatile GnRH or gonadotropins restores fertility in those patients (for a review, see Ref. 2Dodé C. Hardelin J.P. Kallmann syndrome.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2009; 17: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Differential regulation of FSH and LH secretion by GnRH during puberty and throughout the female menstrual cycle is characteristic of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (3Marshall J.C.

Res. 1991; 47 (discussion 188–159): 155-187PubMed Google Scholar). Higher GnRH pulse frequencies result in preferential LH secretion, whereas relatively lower GnRH pulse frequencies favor FSH production. The control of FSH and LH synthesis is linked to the transcription of their specific β subunits, Fshb and Lhb. Moreover, FSH secretion is mainly constitutive, and its synthesis and release are highly correlated (4Farnworth P.G. Gonadotrophin secretion revisited. How many ways can FSH leave a gonadotroph?.J.

Thus, elucidating how the pituitary gonadotrope decodes the GnRH pulse signal into an Fshb transcriptional response is important due to its central role in reproductive function and dysfunction and as a paradigm for pulse-encoded signaling. One barrier to achieving a mechanistic understanding of this regulatory system is that the specific features of the GnRH stimulus responsible for differential gene induction have not been fully considered. The importance of this aspect in studying frequency-dependent phenomena has recently been emphasized (8Fletcher P.A. Clément F. Vidal A. Tabak J. Bertram R. Interpreting frequency responses to dose-conserved pulsatile input signals in simple cell signaling motifs.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e95613Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment or simulation, changing the GnRH pulse frequency with other stimulus parameters held constant also alters the average GnRH concentration. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, high-frequency pulses (30-min cycle period) represent 4 times the average GnRH concentration per cycle period relative to lower-frequency pulses (120-min cycle period) of the same pulse duration (or width) and pulse amplitude (or height; concentration). Thus, whether the gonadotrope is responding to a specific pulse frequency or to a specific average GnRH concentration cannot be determined by only varying pulse frequency. Previous mathematical studies of GnRH signaling have largely neglected the effects of changes in average concentration delivered via altered pulse frequency on differential induction of Fshb. The various characteristics of the signal (pulse width, shape, height, and frequency) responsible for downstream responses may be complex and have non-linear relationships (9Purvis J.E. Lahav G. Encoding and decoding cellular information through signaling dynamics.Cell. 2013; 152: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The limited published experimental data relevant to this question about GnRH signal features (10Dalkin A.C. Haisenleder D.J. Ortolano G.A. Ellis T.R. Marshall J.C.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test the effects of altered pulse frequency at constant average concentration, the pulse duration or the pulse amplitude can be altered (Fig. 1, B and C). However, to compensate by concentration, the concentration of the stimulus has to be in the near-linear regime of the concentration-response curve. Compensating by altering pulse duration requires testing stimulus patterns unrelated to normal physiology that may elicit complex short-term signaling regulation responses. Furthermore, the gonadotropin gene response may vary over time, and sampling that is beyond the capacity of the experimental protocols used to study these responses is needed to obtain reliable mapping of this complex parameter space. We have addressed the question of which components of GnRH pulse stimulation are responsible for Fshb induction using simple, biologically inspired mathematical models of the gonadotrope and the development of a new high-throughput experimental system. We previously reported that Gαs activation by GnRH promoted Lhb but suppressed Fshb gene expression in LβT2 cells and found that this differential effect was mediated, at least in part, via the secretion of autocrine factors including inhibin α (13Choi S.G. Jia J. Pfeffer R.L. Sealfon S.C. G proteins and autocrine signaling differentially regulate gonadotropin subunit expression in pituitary gonadotrope.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 21550-21560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and VGF nerve growth factor-inducible (VGF)/neuroendocrine regulatory peptide-1 (NERP-1) (14Choi S.G.

Chem. 2016; 291: 21322-21334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In contrast with Fshb gene expression, Inha and Vgf were preferentially induced by high GnRH pulse frequency. Thus, we hypothesized that secreted inhibitory factors might contribute to the lower GnRH pulse frequency preference of Fshb induction. To explore this possibility, we constructed a simple mathematical model that recreated the dependence of Fshb expression on GnRH pulsatile signal and its negative regulation by inhibitory factor(s). Model 1 comprised the GnRH stimulus, Fshb, and inhibitory factor(s) (IF), with IF exerting a negative feedback on Fshb synthesis rate (Fig. 2i); see model 1 equations under “Experimental procedures”). Although this reduced model was not a complete description of the gonadotrope network, it isolated the role of inhibitory autocrine or intracellular factors to investigate minimal requirements for the Fshb gene response to low GnRH pulse frequency. To model the conditions of the standard experiment protocol (Fig. 1A), we set pulse duration at 5 min and varied the pulse period without compensating for average concentration changes, which occur when altering frequency in this protocol. Cooperativity among the inhibitory factor(s) was required for the GnRH low-frequency (long cycle period) preference of the Fshb gene (n > 1; see Equation 4). As shown in Fig. 3, when n = 1, Fshb expression increases monotonically with decreasing GnRH period. By contrast, when n = 2 or n = 3, Fshb gene expression shows a U-shaped GnRH frequency-response relationship with a maximum at a period of roughly 120 min. Both the GnRH stimulus for Fshb production and the inhibitory factor level increase with increasing frequency. Without cooperativity, the effect of this inhibitory factor remains proportional to the Fshb-stimulating GnRH stimulus, and a monotonic curve results. With cooperativity, the inhibitory effect increases more than the stimulatory effect at increasing frequency, generating a U-shaped response curve. n = 3 was used as the cooperativity parameter in the fitting of model 1 to experimental data. Consistent with experimental data on the inhibitory factor VGF (14Choi S.G. Wang Q. Jia J. Chikina M. Pincas H. Dolios G. Sasaki K. Wang R. Minamino N. Salton S.R. Sealfon S.C.

The model simulations showed good agreement with experimental data for Vgf and Fshb obtained using the same protocol (14Choi S.G. Wang Q. Jia J. Chikina M. Pincas H. Dolios G. Sasaki K. Wang R.

At the end of each simulation, the total accumulated concentrations of IF (A) and Fshb (B) were plotted in AU. ii, modeling the effects of GnRH on average IF and Fshb mRNA expression at varied cycle periods. Average levels of IF (A) and Fshb (B) mRNAs were calculated over a single cycle at steady state and expressed in AU.

Error bars represent S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As noted above, changing GnRH pulse frequency in the standard protocol also alters the average GnRH concentration stimulus. To determine whether model 1 was a true frequency decoder, we carried out simulations where cycle period was varied while keeping average GnRH concentration constant by adjusting pulse duration. This compensated simulation completely eliminated the apparent frequency sensitivity seen in the standard protocol (Fig. 4). Conversely, when average GnRH concentration was varied while holding cycle period constant, a concentration sensitivity was observed (data not shown) that paralleled the results obtained with the standard protocol (Fig. 4B (ii)). Thus, in model 1, Fshb gene activity is actually dependent on the average GnRH concentration, with the standard uncompensated protocol using GnRH pulse frequency changes as a mechanism for delivering different average GnRH concentrations. These effects can be seen more clearly in the contour plots shown in Fig. 4, A and B (iv), which summarize the results of many simulations performed at finely varied pulse durations and cycle periods. For instance, in the Fshb contour plot (Fig. 4B (iv)) the color, from dark blue to dark red, represents the level of Fshb expression. The result of simulation under any conditions can be determined from this plot. For example, the dotted horizontal line reflects a standard experiment (shown in Fig. 4B (ii)) with pulse duration held constant. The solid black lines represent coordinate variation of pulse duration and period, such that average GnRH concentration is held constant (constant τ/T) while the pulse frequency is changed. The level of Fshb can be seen to depend entirely on average GnRH concentration, because Fshb is unchanging along any constant average GnRH concentration (constant τ/T). Fshb induction has an optimum average concentration that corresponds to the concentration delivered by the 120-min GnRH pulse period in the standard 5-min pulse duration protocol. A pulse frequency-sensitive model has been proposed by the Goldbeter group (15Li Y. Goldbeter A. Frequency specificity in intercellular communication: influence of patterns of periodic signaling on target cell responsiveness.Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 125-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to explain the effect of periodic stimuli on cellular response. The model included a receptor system capable of desensitization toward its ligand. According to this desensitization paradigm, a fast process of desensitization and a slower resensitization process were required for optimal stimulus frequency. Desensitization schemes were suggested to play a role in the GnRH system as well as in other systems (16Bertram R. Li Y.X.

Moreover, recent experimental studies showed that the Gαq pathway, unlike Gαs, is subject to rapid desensitization in response to pulse stimulation (19Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M.

Offermanns S. Gadella Jr., T.W. Real-time visualization of heterotrimeric G protein Gq activation in living cells.BMC Biol. 2011; 9: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated a model in which, in response to GnRH stimulus, a desensitizing stimulatory factor (DF) rapidly moves from a resting state (DFr) to an active state (DFa) and then rapidly inactivates into an inactive state (DFi); in the absence of GnRH, DFi slowly resensitizes to the resting state. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (ii), Fshb production depends on active DF (DFa). Model 2 equations are provided under “Experimental procedures.” Computer simulations of this model were carried out at two different cycle periods of GnRH stimulus: 30 and 120 min. Pulse duration (5 min) was unchanged from model 1. As in model 1, simulations showed that Fshb expression was optimal at the long cycle period (120 min). DFa also showed maximal expression at the 120-min cycle period (Fig. 5, A and B (i)); at the long cycle period, DFa first desensitized and then was able to resensitize between pulses, whereas at the short cycle period (30 min), DFa desensitized quickly and then did not have time to resensitize. Fshb reached steady state levels after ∼13 h. We fitted the model to previously reported experimental data (14Choi S.G. Wang Q. Jia J. Chikina M. Pincas H. Dolios G. Sasaki K. Wang R. Minamino N. Salton S.R. Sealfon S.C. Characterization of gonadotrope secretoproteome identifies neurosecretory protein VGF-derived peptide suppression of follicle-stimulating hormone gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 21322-21334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B (ii), this produced a cycle period-Fshb response curve with a maximum at the 120-min cycle period, which was consistent with the data. In contrast, the cycle period-response plot for mean DFi decreased monotonically as cycle period increased (Fig. 5A (ii)). To determine whether model 2 was a true frequency decoder, we carried out further simulations where cycle period was varied while keeping average GnRH concentration constant, by adjusting pulse duration. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B (iii), the plots for DFi and Fshb exhibited similar shapes as in Fig. 5A (ii), with the characteristic cycle period-Fshb response curve peaking at the 120-min cycle period. This indicated that model 2 was a true frequency decoder. As for model 1, we examined the effects of variations in the stimulus parameters, namely cycle period and pulse duration, on Fshb and DFi steady state values. As illustrated in Fig. 5, A and B (iv), mean DFi decreased monotonically as pulse duration and cycle period increased. By contrast, mean Fshb was maximal in a specific region of cycle period values of 100–200 min and low pulse duration and decreased as both cycle period and pulse duration decreased. These results corroborated that Fshb gene response in model 2 was contingent upon frequency of the GnRH stimulus. We previously identified GDF9 as a secreted autocrine factor, which induces the Fshb gene but is preferentially decreased by high-frequency GnRH pulses (22Choi S.G. Wang Q. Jia J. Pincas H. Turgeon J.L. Sealfon S.C. Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) forms an incoherent feed-forward loop modulating follicle-stimulating hormone β-subunit (FSHβ) gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 16164-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Knockdown experiments also suggested that GDF9 contributes to the regulation of GnRH pulse frequency preference of the Fshb gene. We studied a model where GnRH initiates rapid inactivation of a DF (e.g. GDF9); in the absence of GnRH stimulation, the inactive form of DF slowly resensitizes, and DF then activates Fshb gene expression. As illustrated in Fig. 2 (iii), Fshb production depends on both DF and the GnRH stimulus. Model 3 equations are provided under “Experimental procedures.” Computer simulations of this model were carried out at two different cycle periods of GnRH stimulus: 30 and 120 min. Pulse duration (5 min) was unchanged from model 1. As in model 1, simulations showed that Fshb expression was optimal at the long cycle period (120 min). DF also showed maximal expression at the 120-min cycle period (Fig. 6, A and B (i)); at the long cycle period, DF was able to resensitize between pulses, whereas at the short cycle period (30 min), DF desensitized quickly and then did not have time to resensitize. Fshb reached steady state levels after ∼13 h. This model also was consistent with experimental data, as represented in Fig. 6B (ii). The cycle period-response plot for mean DF increased monotonically as cycle period increased (Fig. 6A (ii)). To determine whether model 3 was a true frequency decoder, we carried out further simulations where cycle period was varied while keeping average GnRH concentration constant, by adjusting pulse duration. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B (iii), the plots for DF and Fshb exhibited similar shapes as in Fig. 6A (ii), with the characteristic cycle period-Fshb response curve peaking at the 120-min cycle period. This demonstrated that model 3 showed true frequency decoding. As in model 1, we examined the effects of variations in the stimulus parameters, namely cycle period and pulse duration, on Fshb and DF steady-state values. As illustrated in Fig. 6, A and B (iv), mean DF increased monotonically as pulse duration and cycle period increased. By contrast, mean Fshb was maximal in a specific region of cycle period values of 100–200 min and low pulse duration and decreased as both cycle period and pulse duration increased. These results corroborated that Fshb gene response in model 3 was contingent upon frequency of the GnRH stimulus. The model simulations revealed that experimental data obtained using the standard protocol, which does not compensate for average concentration changes that occur when GnRH pulse frequency is altered, were consistent with mechanistically distinct models. In the case of the inhibitory factor model 1, changes in GnRH pulse frequency alter Fshb levels only because they alter the average GnRH concentration to which the cells are exposed. The research community has accepted for decades the view that Fshb is GnRH frequency-controlled. Nonetheless, the modeling results led us to the question of what components of the GnRH signal were in fact being sensed by the gonadotrope and the gene control mechanisms underlying Fshb induction. Previous attempts to evaluate GnRH frequency sensing by compensating for changes in average concentration are inconclusive due to the assumption of linearity of compensation effects, limited assays, and lack of non-gonadotropin gene response controls (11Bédécarrats G.Y.

All patients underwent high-resolution, peripheral, quantitative, computed tomography (HR-pQCT) imaging of the ultradistal radius (UR) and tibia (UT). Local bone geometry, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone microarchitecture were obtained by quantitative analysis of HR-pQCT images. To reduce the amount of data and avoid multi-collinearity, we performed a factor-analysis of HR-pQCT parameters. Based on factor weight, trabecular BMD, trabecular number, cortical thickness, cortical BMD, and total area were chosen for post-hoc analyses. At the radius and tibia, diabetic men and women exhibited trabecular hypertrophy, with a significant positive main effect of T2DM on trabecular number. At the radius, cortical thickness was higher in diabetic subjects (+20.1%, p = 0.003). Interestingly, there was a statistical trend that suggested attenuation of tibial cortical hypertrophy in diabetic men (cortical thickness, pinteraction = 0.052). Moreover, we found an expected sexual dichotomy, with higher trabecular BMD, Tb.N, cortical BMD, Ct.Th, and total area in men than in women (p≤ 0.003) at both measurement sites. Our results suggest that skeletal hypertrophy associated with T2DM is present in men and women, but appears attenuated at the tibial cortex in men."

The model features the uptake of monocytes into the arterial wall, their proliferation and transition into foam cells. The number of foam cells is assumed to determine the health risk for clinically relevant events such as stroke. In a simulation study, the model was checked against the age-dependent prevalence of atherosclerotic lesions. Next, the model was applied to incidence of atherosclerotic stroke in the cohort of male workers from the Mayak nuclear facility in the Southern Urals. It describes the data as well as standard epidemiological models. Based on goodness-of-fit criteria the risk factors smoking, hypertension and radiation exposure were tested for their effect on disease development. Hypertension was identified to affect disease progression mainly in the late stage of atherosclerosis. Fitting mechanistic models to incidence data allows to integrate biological evidence on disease progression into epidemiological studies. The mechanistic approach adds to an understanding of pathogenic processes, whereas standard epidemiological methods mainly explore the statistical association between risk factors and disease outcome. Due to a more comprehensive scientific foundation, risk estimates from mechanistic models can be deemed more reliable. To the best of our knowledge, such models are applied to epidemiological data on cardiovascular diseases for the first time."

The findings suggest that erosion of nuclear gatekeeping function, which is found in normal brain aging, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including HD. In the mammalian neuron, the nucleus is a membrane-bound sanctuary that safeguards genomic DNA and gene transcription by shielding them from the bustling and sometime perilous molecular events in the cytoplasm. Since the majority of neurons in the brain are destined to live as long as the organism itself, there is a paramount demand for the lifelong maintenance of the integrity of the nuclear envelope and its embedded proteinaceous communication channels, called nuclear pores. Emerging evidence shows molecular links between defects in the nuclear envelope and nuclear pores in neuronal aging (López-Otín et al., 2013López-Otín C. Blasco M.A. Partridge L. Serrano M.

HD is one of the most prevalent dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders. HD patients suffer from a clinical triad of movement disorder, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive impairment. The age of HD onset can be variable, but the progression of the disease is inexorable, and the patient often dies about 15 to 20 years after the onset (Bates et al., 2015Bates G.P. Dorsey R. Gusella J.F. Hayden M.R. Kay C. Leavitt B.R. Nance M. Ross C.A. Scahill R.I. Wetzel R. et al.Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2015; 1: 15005Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion encoding an elongated polyglutamine stretch near the N terminus of Huntingtin (HTT). Ever since the landmark discovery of HD’s causal gene, the field has been studying molecular pathogenic cascades linking the simple polyglutamine repeat expansion to the plethora of HD pathogenic phenotypes, including but not limited to the selective death of striatal and cortical projection neurons. Despite the challenge of studying the very large, ubiquitously expressed mHTT gene and protein, steady progress has been made in uncovering disease mechanisms downstream of mHTT expression. For example, there is some consensus that polyglutamine-expanded mHTT elicits gain-of-function proteinopathy that may affect both nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular function (Bates et al., 2015Bates G.P. Dorsey R. Gusella J.F. Hayden M.R. Kay C. Leavitt B.R. Nance M. Ross C.A. Scahill R.I. Wetzel R. et al.Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2015; 1: 15005Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Although the precise toxic species derived from the mHTT gene remains to be unequivocally established, one such species, small N-terminal polyglutamine fragments of mHTT (e.g., generated by proteolysis or alternative splicing), appear to be particularly neurotoxic (Bates et al., 2015Bates G.P. Dorsey R. Gusella J.F. Hayden M.R. Kay C. Leavitt B.R. Nance M. Ross C.A. Scahill R.I. Wetzel R. et al.Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2015; 1: 15005Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). These fragments can misfold and form aggregates in the nucleus and cytoplasm of HD neurons that are hallmarks of HD neuropathology. Genetic manipulations that accelerate the nuclear translocation of mHTT exacerbate disease pathogenesis in mouse models (Gu et al., 2015Gu X. Cantle J.P. Greiner E.R. Lee C.Y. Barth A.M. Gao F. Park C.S. Zhang Z. Sandoval-Miller S. Zhang R.L. et al.Neuron. 2015; 85: 726-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Out of the many unanswered questions surrounding HD pathogenesis, the two new studies here shed light on the molecular pathogenic link between the nuclear and cytoplasmic disease processes in HD. The communication between nucleus and cytoplasm is gated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which consists of over 30 different nucleoporin (NUP) proteins (Strambio-De-Castillia et al., 2010Strambio-De-Castillia C. Niepel M. Rout M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 490-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The NPC traverses the double-membrane nuclear envelope and has a central aqueous channel that gates the passive diffusion of proteins of less than 40 kilodaltons. Moreover, the NPC permits selective, directional transport of larger cargoes across the nuclear pore. Bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic transport is regulated by a subset of the NUPs lining the aqueous tunnel of the NPC. These NUPs, interacting with a variety of soluble transport factors, dictate the selectivity and direction of active macromolecular transport across the nuclear pore. One important cytosolic factor is the small GTPase Ran, which maintains a gradient of Ran-GTP that is high in the nucleus and low in the cytoplasm; such a gradient, along with its binding to transporters (i.e., karyopherins), drives many types of nuclear import and export. Importantly, the conversion of Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP by a factor called RanGAP1 on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC is a pivotal event to maintain the Ran-GTP gradient for nucleocytoplasmic transport (Figure 1). Prior reports suggest nuclear envelope distortion or individual nuclear pore protein abnormalities in HD; however, comprehensive analyses of NPC pathology, particularly in models expressing full-length mHTT, was lacking until now.

Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 48-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar perform an in-depth, longitudinal analysis of nuclear membrane shape and of selected nuclear transport proteins in a knockin mouse model (zQ175) expressing one or two copies of endogenous mHTT with ∼190 CAG repeats, and they complement their findings with another mouse model (R6/2) expressing mHTT-exon1 and with HD-patient iPSC neurons and postmortem brains. Impressively, they found several nuclear membrane or NPC defects, including altered nuclear membrane shape, mislocalization, and aggregation of RanGAP1 and Gle1, an mRNA export factor. These aggregated nuclear pore factors appear to colocalize with mHTT aggregates in the nucleus, suggesting at least a partial sequestration and functional depletion mechanism. The latter idea is supported by the evidence that mRNA, a cargo of RanGAP1- and Gle1-mediated nuclear export, is aberrantly and progressively accumulated in the nuclei of HD mouse brains, HD patient iPSC neurons, and postmortem brains. Moreover, the study also reveals an elevated double-strand DNA break in HD mouse models. Based on the striking parallels between their findings in aging wild-type neurons and in exacerbated, aging-like phenotypes in HD neurons, Gassett-Rosa and colleagues propose the idea that mHTT may accelerate neuronal aging during disease pathogenesis. The study by Grima et al., 2017Grima J.C. Daigle J.G. Arbez N. Cunningham K.C. Zhang K. Ochabe J. Geater C. Morozko E. Stocksdale J. Glatzer J.C. et al.Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 93-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar focuses on the NPC protein complex to test the hypothesis that mHTT may selectively impair specific NPC proteins and soluble transporters, which may play a causal role in mHTT toxicities. Using the R6/2 mouse model at an age with severe disease, they performed an exhaustive screen of nearly all the nucleoporins and NUP-associated proteins, and they found several with mislocalization. Consistent with the Gasset-Rosa work, one of the mislocalized proteins was RanGAP1; the others were Nup62 and Nup88. Importantly, the aberrant localization of these proteins—especially their partial colocalization with mHTT aggregates—is confirmed by studies in zQ175 mice and HD postmortem brains, and some aspects are confirmed in iPSC neurons with more modest CAG repeat expansion. The Grima study provides several mechanistic insights as well. First, Grima and colleagues show that reduction of mHTT aggregation appears to normalize RanGAP1 levels. Second, they establish a primary neuron model in which transient expression of full-length mHTT recapitulates the nuclear pore leakiness, the deficiency in active nuclear transport, and the mislocalization of RanGAP1. Using such a model, they showed that newly discovered HD repeat-associated non-ATG translation (RAN) (Bañez-Coronel et al., 2015Bañez-Coronel M. Ayhan F. Tarabochia A.D. Zu T. Perez B.A. Tusi S.K.

Margolis R.L. et al.Neuron. 2015; 88: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) products are sufficient to induce nuclear import defects, reminiscent of the findings in ALS and FTD models with similar toxic RAN translation products (Taylor et al., 2016Taylor J.P. Brown Jr., R.H. Cleveland D.W. Nature. 2016; 539: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). More importantly, they showed that overexpression of Ran or RanGAP1 in the primary neuron model and a fly model expressing a mHTT fragment can suppress mHTT cytotoxicity, reduce neurodegeneration, and improve survival. One caveat, however, is that the study did not evaluate whether such perturbation can normalize the nuclear transport deficits in the HD cells. Finally, Grima et al., 2017Grima J.C. Daigle J.G. Arbez N. Cunningham K.C. Zhang K. Ochabe J. Geater C. Morozko E. Stocksdale J. Glatzer J.C. et al.Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 93-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar provide a hopeful glimpse of how targeting nucleocytoplasmic transport with small molecules can improve diseased neuron survival. How efficacious such compounds are in mammalian models of HD in vivo remains unknown. Together, the two studies provide firm evidence that compromised nuclear pore function is a consistent finding in a wide range of HD models. The molecular defects in the nuclear envelope, NPC, and nucleocytoplasmic transport are reminiscent of those found in ALS and FTD caused by hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 (Taylor et al., 2016Taylor J.P. Brown Jr., R.H. Cleveland D.W. Nature. 2016; 539: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). The transcribed C9ORF72 repeat displays both RNA and protein toxicities that impair nuclear integrity and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Importantly, genetic mutations in multiple nuclear pore proteins, including Nups and RanGAP1, can suppress mutant C9ORF72 toxicities in Drosophila (Taylor et al., 2016Taylor J.P. Brown Jr., R.H. Cleveland D.W. Nature. 2016; 539: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). The study by Gasset-Rosa et al., 2017Gasset-Rosa F. Chillon-Marinas C. Goginashvili A. Atwal R.S. Artates J.W. Tabet R. Wheeler V.C. Bang A.G. Cleveland D.W. Lagier-Tourenne C. Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 48-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar also reveals a tantalizing parallel between HD neurons and aging neurons (Figure 1). Neurons in HD knockin mice show the NPC and nuclear trafficking phenotypes and nuclear DNA breaks that are a subset of the known hallmarks of aging (López-Otín et al., 2013López-Otín C. Blasco M.A. Partridge L. Serrano M. Kroemer G. Cell. 2013; 153: 1194-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7828) Google Scholar). Since most of the aging-related molecular defects in heterozygous zQ175 mice are not apparent until 24 months of age, future studies are needed to assess whether all the hallmarks of aging can appear in HD neurons at an accelerated pace and whether such a phenotypic correlate is reflecting some fundamental role of mHTT in interfering with the core neuronal aging programs. Despite the lack of direct causal evidence, the role of aging as a factor in HD is gaining traction. First, studies of HD patients show that the product of CAG length and age (called the CAP score) is one of the best clinical predictors of disease progression (Bates et al., 2015Bates G.P. Dorsey R. Gusella J.F. Hayden M.R. Kay C. Leavitt B.R. Nance M. Ross C.A. Scahill R.I. Wetzel R. et al.Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2015; 1: 15005Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study of an epigenetic aging clock showed that HD patient brains exhibit an accelerated aging phenotype (Horvath et al., 2016Horvath S. Langfelder P. Kwak S. Aaronson J. Rosinski J. Vogt T.F. Eszes M. Faull R.L. Curtis M.A. Waldvogel H.J. et al.Aging (Albany, N.Y.). 2016; 8: 1485-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, further studies on the detailed molecular interactions between mHTT and neuronal aging are clearly warranted. Another critical unresolved question is how mHTT may trigger nuclear pore protein mislocalization and nuclear transport deficits. A consistent finding in the two studies is the partial colocalization of RanGAP1 and other factors (e.g., Gle1 and Nup62) with nuclear mHTT aggregates, as well as concomitant reduction of normal RanGAP1 levels. The sequestration and depletion model is supported by two lines of evidence. First, HD cells show defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport that depend on the functional Ran/RanGAP1 gradient and the failure to maintain NPC permeability barriers for cytoplasmic proteins >40 kDa, a function dependent on intact Nups. Second, overexpression of RanGAP1 suppresses mHTT toxicities in the primary neurons and the Drosophila model. However, the available data thus far are insufficient to reach incontrovertible mechanistic conclusions. For example, the formation of nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates in the striatum of zQ175 mice occurs at a relatively early age (i.e., 4 to 6 months in the nucleus and 8 months in the cytoplasm) (Carty et al., 2015Carty N. Berson N. Tillack K. Thiede C. Scholz D. Kottig K. Sedaghat Y. Gabrysiak C. Yohrling G. von der Kammer H. et al.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0123527Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the appearance of NPC protein mislocalization occurs much later (8 to 12 months). Moreover, HD iPSC neurons do not show visible aggregates but still show altered distribution of several NPC proteins. Therefore, a simple aggregate sequestration model cannot fully account for the HD NPC deficits in some instances; alternative mechanisms, such as direct interactions of mHTT with nuclear transport proteins (e.g., Shirasaki et al., 2012Shirasaki D.I. Greiner E.R. Al-Ramahi I. Gray M. Boontheung P. Geschwind D.H. Botas J. Coppola G. Horvath S. Loo J.A. et al.Neuron. 2012; 75: 41-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) or transcriptional dysregulation of NPC proteins (Langfelder et al., 2016Langfelder P. Cantle J.P. Chatzopoulou D. Wang N. Gao F. Al-Ramahi I. Lu X.H. Ramos E.M. El-Zein K. Zhao Y. et al.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), should be explored. The consequence of nuclear pore leakage can be devastating in the context of HD pathogenesis. Besides the general deterioration of cellular health with NPC compromise, there may be more direct consequences on the nuclear pathogenesis of mHTT itself. Recent studies reveal the N-terminal 17 amino acids (N17) of mHTT as a key signal that confers predominant cytoplasmic localization of mHTT. Deletion of this domain in the context of a fragment (Veldman et al., 2015Veldman M.B. Rios-Galdamez Y. Lu X.H. Gu X. Qin W. Li S. Yang X.W. Lin S. Mol. Neurodegener. 2015; 10: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or full-length mHTT (Gu et al., 2015Gu X. Cantle J.P. Greiner E.R. Lee C.Y. Barth A.M. Gao F. Park C.S. Zhang Z. Sandoval-Miller S. Zhang R.L. et al.Neuron. 2015; 85: 726-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) greatly accelerates its nuclear aggregation and triggers severe HD-like disease phenotypes in vivo. Importantly, N17 is shown to be a nuclear export signal that is dependent on an intact Ran-GTP gradient for its proper function (e.g., Maiuri et al., 2013Maiuri T. Woloshansky T. Xia J. Truant R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2013; 22: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Previous studies could not pinpoint how N17 function becomes compromised in HD neurons, leading to progressive nuclear translocation and aggregation of mHTT. The current studies provide a testable model that impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport could enhance nuclear mHTT pathogenesis through increased passive leakage or diminished nuclear export, hence overcoming N17 function. Finally, any excitement over the new insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as the ones discussed here, has to be tempered by the sobering fact that no disease-modifying therapies are yet available for these devastating disorders. It is encouraging that small molecules indirectly targeting the nuclear transport mechanisms are shown to ameliorate mHTT toxicities in transfected primary neurons (Grima et al., 2017Grima J.C. Daigle J.G. Arbez N. Cunningham K.C. Zhang K. Ochabe J. Geater C. Morozko E. Stocksdale J. Glatzer J.C. et al.Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 93-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, more studies are needed to precisely delineate the nuclear transport mechanism that is optimal to target—not only to restore the nuclear transport function, but also to improve the overall disease outcome in preclinical HD models. With growing interest in protecting the nuclear gatekeepers against assaults from aging and neurodegenerative diseases, one can anticipate with confidence that the pace of discovery will be accelerating.

Global alarm about the fate of tropical coastal coral reefs has recently been heightened by bleaching events brought about by El Nino. Altieri et al. focus on a potential additional source of mortality: “dead zones” resulting from hypoxic conditions. These zones of low dissolved oxygen are well known along temperate coasts but are now a potential threat in tropical coastal waters, too. The hypoxic event recorded by the authors on the Panamanian coast led to coral bleaching and mortality of reef organisms. Corals in tropical waters elsewhere may be at risk from similar events.

https://openalex.org/W2604824860,"Numerous developmental genes have been linked to schizophrenia (SZ) by case-control and genome-wide association studies, suggesting that neurodevelopmental disturbances are major pathogenic mechanisms. However, no neurodevelopmental deficit has been definitively linked to SZ occurrence, likely due to disease heterogeneity and the differential effects of various gene variants across ethnicities. Hence, it is critical to examine linkages in specific ethnic populations, such as Han Chinese. The newly identified RhoGAP ARHGAP18 is likely involved in neurodevelopment through regulation of RhoA/C. Here we describe four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ARHGAP18 associated with SZ across a cohort of >2000 cases and controls from the Han population. Two SNPs, rs7758025 and rs9483050, displayed significant differences between case and control groups both in genotype (P = 0.0002 and P = 7.54×10-6) and allelic frequencies (P = 4.36×10-5 and P = 5.98×10-7), respectively. The AG haplotype in rs7758025-rs9385502 was strongly associated with the occurrence of SZ (P = 0.0012, OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.48-0.93), an association that still held following a 1000-times random permutation test (P = 0.022). In an independently collected validation cohort, rs9483050 was the SNP most strongly associated with SZ. In addition, the allelic frequencies of rs12197901 remained associated with SZ in the combined cohort (P = 0.021), although not in the validation cohort alone (P = 0.251). Collectively, our data suggest the ARHGAP18 may confer vulnerability to SZ in the Chinese Han population, providing additional evidence for the involvement of neurodevelopmental dysfunction in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."

Collecting real data for sediment-dynamics analysis from conventional field survey methods is both tedious and expensive. Therefore, for most rivers, the historical record of data is either missing or not very detailed. Available data and existing tools have much potential and may be used for qualitative prediction of future bathymetric change trend. This study shows that proxy approaches may be used to increase the spatiotemporal resolution of flow data, and hypothesize the river cross-sections and sediment data. Sediment-dynamics analysis of the reach of the Tenryu River upstream of Sakuma Dam in Japan was performed to predict its future bathymetric changes using a 1D numerical model (HEC-RAS). In this case study, only annually-averaged flow data and the river's longitudinal bed profile at 5-year intervals were available. Therefore, the other required data, including river cross-section and geometry and sediment inflow grain sizes, had to be hypothesized or assimilated indirectly. The model yielded a good qualitative agreement, with an R2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.8 for the observed and simulated bed profiles. A predictive simulation demonstrated that the useful life of the dam would end after the year 2035 (±5 years), which is in conformity with initial detailed estimates. The study indicates that a sediment-dynamic analysis can be performed even with a limited amount of data. However, such studies may only assess the qualitative trends of sediment dynamics."

During neurulation in vertebrate embryos, a topologically flat surface pinches off a tube to form the central nervous system. Deficiencies in folate can cause failure to close that tube, leading to birth defects such as spina bifida. Balashova et al. used the amphibian Xenopus laevis , in which neurulation is externally visible on developing embryos, to parse what goes wrong. The analysis points to a key role of folate receptor-a, found at the right time and place—at the apical surface of the neural plate—where it interacts with cytoskeletal and adherens junction components. The changes in tissue shape that signify neurulation follow from changes in the shape of the constituent cells: As cellular apices constrict, the tissue folds. Folate seems to function here not in its metabolic capacity, but as a signal modifying cellular shape.

Quantum entanglement produces correlations between particles that cannot be described classically, and it is a resource sought out in many applications to leverage the quantum advantage over classical operation. However, determining whether particles are entangled is a complex process that can require a set of measurements (the witness) to establish the extent of the correlations between them. Shanhandeh et al. describe a protocol that should simplify the job of the witness somewhat. Using already known information about the systems, they demonstrate that entangled and unentangled states can be distinguished using fewer measurements. Extendable to larger systems, the simplified but enhanced witness should prove useful in quantum devices for which verifying entanglement is required.

Kendrick et al. turned to a suite of geochemical data to look at the impact of recycling on volatile outgassing, which turns out to dominate the volatile budget. Their results point to a heavily processed mantle in which volatiles are introduced by subduction and released as crust dehydrates. This discovery implies an early Earth in which surface water was recycled into the mantle and outgassed back onto the surface, without the need to invoke deep mantle reservoirs.
