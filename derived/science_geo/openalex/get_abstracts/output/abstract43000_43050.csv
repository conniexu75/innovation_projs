https://openalex.org/W2058601367,"The proto-oncogene c-fos is expressed in neurons in response to direct stimulation by growth factors and neurotransmitters. In order to determine whether the c-fos protein (Fos) and Fos-related proteins can be induced in response to polysynaptic activation, rat hindlimb motor/sensory cortex was stimulated electrically and Fos expression examined immunohistochemically. Three hours after the onset of stimulation, focal nuclear Fos staining was seen in motor and sensory thalamus, pontine nuclei, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. Moreover, 24-hour water deprivation resulted in Fos expression in paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Fos immunohistochemistry therefore provides a cellular method to label polysynaptically activated neurons and thereby map functional pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1544750576,"Three model, unrelated enzymes (yeast alcohol oxidase, mushroom polyphenol oxidase, and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase) were found to be catalytically active in a variety of organic solvents. For all enzymes and solvents tested, the enzymatic activity greatly increased upon an increase in the water content in the solvents (which always remained below the solubility limit). Much less water was required to reach the maximal activity in hydrophobic solvents than in their hydrophilic counterparts. However, when the catalytic activity was plotted versus the amount of water bound to the enzymes, a common pattern emerged for different solvents. These data suggest that the effect of organic solvents on an enzyme is primarily due to interactions with the enzyme-bound, essential layer of water rather than with the enzyme itself. At optimal water contents, enzymatic activities in organic solvents were in the range from 20 to 40% of those in aqueous solutions. From experiments on (i) replacement of water with other hydrogen bond-forming additives and (ii) titration of enzyme amino groups in an organic medium, as well as the literature data on dehydrated enzymes, it is concluded that the water required by enzymes in nonaqueous solvents provides them with sufficient conformational flexibility needed for catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2013026243,"SEC4, one of the 10 genes involved in the final stage of the yeast secretory pathway, encodes a ras-like, GTP-binding protein. In wild-type cells, Sec4 protein is located on the cytoplasmic face of both the plasma membrane and the secretory vesicles in transit to the cell surface. In all post-Golgi blocked sec mutants, Sec4p is predominantly associated with the secretory vesicles that accumulate as a result of the secretory block. Sec4p is synthesized as a soluble protein that rapidly (t1/2 less than or equal to 1 min) and tightly associates with secretory vesicles and the plasma membrane by virtue of a conformational change of a covalent modification. These data suggest that Sec4p may function as a ""G"" protein on the vesicle surface to transduce an intracellular signal needed to regulate transport between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2079712794,"The expression of MHC class II genes is tightly regulated. One form of congenital severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized by a regulatory defect that precludes expression of HLA class II genes. B lymphocyte cell lines from such SCID patients provide a tool for identifying putative regulatory proteins that bind to class II gene promoters. We have identified three proteins binding to specific segments of the HLA-DRA promoter, two of which interact to form the predominant DNA-protein complex observed. One of these proteins, defined as an X box binding protein (RF-X), is specifically missing in cells from class II deficient SCID patients. We propose that the molecular defect in this congenital HLA class II regulatory deficiency is a lack of RF-X and that this factor plays an important role in the normal regulation of MHC class II gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1595805439,"The cDNA for human beta 2-interferon (IFN-beta 2)/B-cell differentiation factor 2/hepatocyte-stimulating factor was expressed in Escherichia coli to yield a fusion protein which contains the 182 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of IFN-beta 2 fused to a 34-amino acid prokaryotic leader peptide (rIFN-beta 2). When added to cultures of human hepatoma cell line Hep3B2, rIFN-beta 2 as well as preparations of natural IFN-beta 2 enhance secretion of positive acute phase reactants such as alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, complement C3, fibrinogen, and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and inhibit secretion of albumin, confirming that a protein derived from the IFN-beta 2 gene can have hepatocyte-stimulating factor activity. We have prepared a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to the E. coli-derived human IFN-beta 2 fusion protein. This polyclonal antiserum inhibits the hepatocyte-stimulating and B-cell differentiation activities of appropriate IFN-beta 2 preparations. The anti-rIFN-beta 2 antiserum has been used in immunoprecipitation experiments and in Western blots to help define the secretory proteins derived from the IFN-beta 2 gene in fibroblasts and monocytes. Uninduced human FS-4 fibroblasts as well as those induced with interleukin-1 alpha, tumor necrosis factor, or bacterial lipopolysaccharide secrete at least five forms of IFN-beta 2 of apparent molecular mass in the range from 23 to 30 kDa which can be resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions. The three higher molecular mass forms are not observed when FS-4 cells are induced in the presence of tunicamycin, suggesting that these forms are N-glycosylated (gp28, gp29, and gp30). Although secretion of the two lower molecular mass forms is resistant to tunicamycin, they are labeled by [3H]glucosamine (gp23-gp25). The inclusion of cycloheximide during the [35S]methionine labeling of induced FS-4 cells results in the preferential synthesis and secretion of the 29-kDa triplet. Human monocytes induced with bacterial lipopolysaccharide also secrete several distinct forms of IFN-beta 2 in the size range from 23 to 30 kDa which co-migrate in polyacrylamide gels with those obtained from FS-4 cells. Our observations help relate previous descriptions of multiple forms of hepatocyte-stimulating factor to specific proteins derived from the IFN-beta 2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1573232618,"We have examined the kinetics of 1,2-diacylglycerol production in quiescent IIC9 fibroblasts. alpha-Thrombin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) both stimulate an increase in the mass of cellular 1,2-diacylglycerol. The generation of 1,2-diacylglycerol is biphasic when stimulated by a high concentration of alpha-thrombin (500 ng/ml), with an early phase peaking at 15 s and a late phase peaking at 5 min. Production of 1,2-diacylglycerol is monophasic when stimulated by: (a) a low concentration of alpha-thrombin (100 pg/ml); (b) a high concentration of alpha-thrombin added to cultures which had been pretreated with chymotrypsin; or (c) EGF. In all cases the stimulation of 1,2-diacylglycerol was sustained for at least 30 min. In a previous report (Raben, D. M., Yasuda, K., and Cunningham, D. D. (1987) Biochemistry 26, 2759-2765), it was demonstrated that alpha-thrombin stimulates lipid metabolism in fibroblasts via two coupling mechanisms designated R1 and R2. We now present evidence that the early phase of alpha-thrombin-stimulated 1,2-diacylglycerol production is related to R1, which is characterized by: 1) increased release of arachidonic acid, 2) hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides, and 3) inhibition by pretreating cultures with chymotrypsin. The late phase is related to R2 which is characterized by 1,2-diacylglycerol production in the absence of stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and arachidonic acid release. In addition, EGF activates an R2-like mechanism in that it does not stimulate the release of arachidonic acid or hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides but does stimulate a 2-fold increase in 1,2-diacylglycerol mass."
https://openalex.org/W1596829407,"The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) is a 21-kDa GTP-binding protein cofactor in the cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the stimulatory regulatory subunit of adenylate cyclase. Purified bovine brain ARF was digested with cyanogen bromide, and peptides were purified and sequenced. Approximately 25-30% of the protein was sequenced in this manner. Peptides contained consensus sequences for GTP-binding proteins but were distinct from any of the previously published GTP-binding proteins. Antibodies were raised in rabbits against both protein and synthetic peptide fragments of ARF. Specific ARF immunoreactivity was detected in every eukaryotic tissue or cell examined, including yeast, slime mold, and man. No ARF immunoreactivity was observed when Escherichia coli proteins were tested. Immunoblotting revealed the majority of ARF to be present in the 100,000 x g supernatant. Immunological cross-reactivity with the cytosolic factor indicate that it and ARF are likely to be the same protein. ARF is shown to be myristylated at the amino terminus. The potential role of myristylation in cellular localization is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1494589143,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene and significant stretches of DNA which extend into its 5'- and 3'-flanking DNA regions; a total sequence of 15,867 base pairs (bp) is presented. The sequenced 5'-flanking DNA (1,520 bp) contains the essential eukaryotic cis-type proximal regulatory elements CCAAT and TATAA; the more distal 5'-flanking DNA region, as well as some introns, contain sequence elements which share identities with known eukaryotic enhancer elements. A major finding is the identification of a large region of shared nucleotides (comprising of about 520 bp) between the 5'-flanking DNAs of PAI-1 and tissue-type plasminogen activator genes. The length of the PAI-1 5'-untranslated region was found to be 145 bp as determined by nuclease analysis. The remaining PAI-1 structural gene consists of amino acid coding regions (containing a total of 1,206 bp, coding for the 23 amino acids of the signal peptide and 379 amino acids of the mature PAI-1 protein), 8 intron regions (a total of 8,978 bp), and a long 3'-untranslated region of about 1,800 bp which contains several polyadenylation sites. Two types of repetitive DNA elements are located within the PAI-1 structural gene and flanking DNAs: we have found 12 Alu elements and 5 repeats of a long poly (Pur) element. These Alu-Pur elements may represent a subset of the more abundant Alu family of repetitive sequence elements.

https://openalex.org/W1501954650,"A minor species of isoleucine tRNA (tRNA(minor Ile)) specific to the codon AUA has been isolated from Escherichia coli B and a modified nucleoside N+ has been found in the first position of the anticodon (Harada, F., and Nishimura, S. (1974) Biochemistry 13, 300-307). In the present study, tRNA(minor Ile)) was purified from E. coli A19, and nucleoside N+ was prepared, by high-performance liquid chromatography, in an amount (0.6) A260 units) sufficient for the determination of chemical structures. By 400 MHz 1H NMR analysis, nucleoside N+ was found to have a pyrimidine moiety and a lysine moiety, the epsilon amino group of which was involved in the linkage between these two moieties. From the NMR analysis together with mass spectrometry, the structure of nucleoside N+ was determined as 4-amino-2-(N6-lysino)-1-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)pyrimidinium (lysidine), which was confirmed by chemical synthesis. Lysidine is a novel type of modified cytidine with a lysine moiety and has one positive charge. Probably because of such a unique structure, lysidine in the first position of anticodon recognizes adenosine but not guanosine in the third position of codon."
https://openalex.org/W2156783211,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) contains three domains whose functions are cell recognition, membrane translocation, and ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2. PE40 is a form of PE which is missing the cell recognition domain. To study the properties of PE40, it was expressed in Escherichia coli using a vector which contains a T7 phage promoter, an OmpA signal sequence, and that portion of the PE gene encoding PE40. Upon induction with isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside, large amounts of PE40 were secreted, and highly purified PE40 was prepared from the culture medium. PE40 was chemically coupled to different monoclonal antibodies, and protein synthesis inhibition activities of these immunotoxins was assessed on various cell lines. These activities were compared with the activities of the corresponding immunotoxins made with native PE. These data indicate that PE40 may be useful in the construction of certain immunotoxins."
https://openalex.org/W1538793513,"Amnion is believed to be a tissue of signal importance, anatomically and functionally, in the maintenance of pregnancy and during the initiation of parturition. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like agents cause a striking increase in the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in human amnion cells but only if arachidonic acid is present in the culture medium. To investigate the regulation of arachidonic acid metabolism by EGF-like agents in amnion, we used mEGF and human amnion cells in primary monolayer culture as a model system. The amount of PGE2 secreted into the culture medium was quantified by radioimmunoassay and the rate of conversion of [14C]arachidonic acid to [14C]PGE2 (PGH2 synthase activity) in cell sonicates was determined under optimal in vitro conditions. Treatment of amnion cells with mEGF led to a marked increase in the rate of production of PGE2. The specific activity of PGH2 synthase (viz. the combined activities of prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH2) synthase and PGH2-PGE isomerase) was increased by 2-5-fold in cells treated with mEGF. Treatment of amnion cells with mEGF for 4 h did not affect the specific activities of phospholipase A2 or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. By immunoisolation of newly synthesized, [35S]methionine-labeled PGH2 synthase, we found that mEGF stimulated de novo synthesis of the enzyme. Thus, mEGF acts in human amnion cells in primary monolayer culture to increase the rate of PGE2 biosynthesis by a mechanism that involves induction of PGH2 synthase; the manifestation of EGF action on PGE2 biosynthesis is dependent on the presence of nonesterified arachidonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1549257577,"The endothelium may contribute to fibrinolysis through the binding of plasminogen activators or plasminogen activator inhibitors to the cell surface. Using a solid-phase radioimmunoassay, we observed that antibodies to recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) bound to the surface of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC also specifically bound added radiolabeled rt-PA with apparent steady-state binding being reached by 1 h at 4 degrees C. When added at low concentrations (less than 5 nM), rt-PA bound with high affinity mainly via the catalytic site, forming a sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable 105-kDa complex which dissociates from the cell surface over time and which could be immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody to PAI-1. rt-PA bound to this high affinity site retained less than 5% of its expected plasminogen activator activity. At higher concentrations, binding did not require the catalytic site and was rapidly reversible. rt-PA initially bound to this site retained plasminogen activator activity. These studies suggest that tissue-type plasminogen activator and PAI-1 are expressed on the surface of cultured HUVEC. HUVEC also express unoccupied binding sites for exogenous tissue-type plasminogen activator. The balance between the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitors and these unoccupied binding sites for plasminogen activators on the endothelial surface may contribute to the regulation of fibrinolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1535763642,"Microtubule-associated protein tau from bovine brain reacted on immunoblots and on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a monoclonal antibody, Alz 50, which has previously been found to bind to an Alzheimer disease-specific antigen. The apparent affinity of binding of Alz 50 to tau was 2.1 X 10(-9) M on competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and it was in the same range as for Tau-1 (0.5 X 10(-9) M), an antibody raised against purified bovine tau proteins. Immunoblotting of trypsin-digested tau revealed differences between Alz 50 and Tau-1 binding sites. The binding of both antibodies to tau was not affected by prior treatment with phosphatase, indicating that the cross-reactivity of Alz 50 with tau is due to the presence of phosphate-independent epitope. This epitope then differs from phosphate-dependent tau epitopes often shared with other cytoskeletal proteins. Alz 50 and Tau-1 binding sites were present in all isoelectric (pI 6-8) and molecular weight variants of tau. In contrast, phosphate-dependent epitopes recognized by another tau-reactive antibody (NP14) were found mostly in acidic tau variants. Similarly to tau proteins from bovine brain, tau-enriched preparations from normal human brain contained Alz 50 and Tau-1 reactive sites in all isoelectric (pI 6.5-8.5) and molecular weight variants. Our observation of Alz 50 cross-reactivity with tau suggests a relationship between tau and the novel protein identified recently in Alzheimer brains."
https://openalex.org/W1889813890,"The guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which transduce hormonal and light signals across the plasma membrane, are heterotrimers composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. Activation of G proteins by guanine nucleotides is accompanied by dissociation of the heterotrimer: G + alpha.beta.gamma in equilibrium alpha G + beta.gamma. Brain contains several G proteins of which the most abundant are alpha 39.beta.gamma and alpha 41.beta.gamma. We have used proteolysis by trypsin to study the functional domains of the alpha subunits. In the presence of guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, trypsin removes a 2-kDa peptide from the amino terminus of these proteins (Hurley, J. B., Simon, M. I., Teplow, D. B., Robishaw, J. D., and Gilman, A. G. (1984) Science 226, 860-862; Winslow, J. W., Van Amsterdam, J. R., and Neer, E. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7571-7579). Tryptic cleavage does not affect the GTPase activity of the truncated molecule nor the apparent Km for GTP. However, removal of the 2-kDa amino-terminal peptide prevents association of the alpha subunits with beta.gamma. Since the apparent substrate for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation is the alpha.beta.gamma heterotrimer, the trypsin-cleaved alpha subunit is not a substrate for the toxin. Digestion of the carboxyl terminus of alpha 39 with carboxypeptidase A prevents ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin but does not interfere with the formation of alpha 39.beta.gamma heterotrimers. We do not yet know whether the amino-terminal region of alpha 39 interacts with beta gamma directly or whether it is necessary to maintain a conformation of alpha 39 which is required for heterotrimer formation. Further studies are needed to define the nature of the contracts between alpha and beta gamma subunits since understanding the structural basis for their reversible interaction is fundamental to understanding their function."
https://openalex.org/W1596414504,"Because free long-chain bases have been recently found to have potent pharmacological effects when added to neutrophils (Wilson, E., Olcott, M. C., Bell, R. M., Merrill, A. H., Jr., and Lambeth, J. D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12616-12623) and other cell types, the levels in human neutrophils were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Sphingosine was the major free long-chain base in freshly isolated cells and ranged from 13 to 101 pmol/10(7) cells for different donors (mean +/- S.E. of 50 +/- 5, n = 17). Upon incubation at 37 degrees C, there was a time-dependent increase in free sphingosine (57 +/- 8% in 1 h, n = 17), but no change was seen at 4 or 25 degrees C. The sphingosine was apparently derived from more complex sphingolipids because little (less than 1%) could be accounted for by new synthesis from [14C]serine. Greater increases in free sphingosine were obtained when neutrophils were incubated with serum, plasma, or serum lipoproteins (about 2-fold higher than for cells incubated alone). In contrast, agonists such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, A23187, arachidonic acid, low concentrations (10 nM) of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, and opsonized zymosan either decreased the amount of free sphingosine or blunted the time-dependent increase. This may be due to enhanced removal of free sphingosine because phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated cells exhibited an increased conversion of exogenously added [3H]sphinganine to ceramides. Endogenous sphingosine was approximately one-tenth the level found in neutrophils when exogenous long-chain bases were added to inhibit protein kinase C. Hence, depending on the subcellular localization of the endogenous versus exogenous long-chain bases, the amounts of free sphingosine in neutrophils might be sufficient to affect the function of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1479724237,"Abstract The chemistry of Maillard or browning reactions of glycated proteins is being studied in model systems in vitro in order to characterize potential reaction pathways and products in biological systems. In previous work with the Amadori rearrangement product N alpha-formyl-N epsilon-fructoselysine (fFL), an analog of glycated lysine residues in proteins, we showed that fFL was oxidatively cleaved between C-2 and C-3 of the carbohydrate chain to yield N epsilon-carboxymethyllysine (CML) and D-erythronic acid. We then detected CML in proteins glycated in vitro, as well as in human lens proteins and collagen in vivo (Ahmed, M. U., Thorpe, S. R., and Baynes, J. W. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 4889-4894). This work provided an explanation for the origin of CML in human urine and evidence for non-browning pathways of the Maillard reaction in vivo. In this report we describe the identification of a second set of products resulting from oxidative cleavage of fFL between C-3 and C-4 of the sugar chain, i.e. 3-(N epsilon-lysino)-lactic acid (LL) and D-glyceric acid. The formation of LL from fFL was increased at slightly acid pH, representing about 30% of the yield of CML at pH 6.4, compared with 4% at pH 7.4 in phosphate buffer. By gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, LL was detected in proteins glycated in vitro and then identified as a natural product in human lens proteins and urine. Our results indicate that oxidative degradation of Amadori adducts to proteins occurs in vivo, leading to formation and excretion of CML and LL. These non-browning pathways for reaction of Amadori compounds may be physiologically relevant mechanisms for averting potentially damaging consequences of the Maillard reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1509178893,"Microtubule-associated protein tau was characterized in 5 Alzheimer and 5 control brains using two monoclonal antibodies, Alz 50 and Tau-1. Quantitative analysis of immunoblots with the antibodies showed that both homogenate and supernatant fractions (12,000 x g) from Alzheimer brains contained 38-65% less tau immunoreactivity compared to normal brains. The reduction was found in all brain regions studied (frontal and temporal lobes and thalamus) and in both gray and white matter. In partially purified tau preparations, the yield of protein was lower in Alzheimer (by 35%) than in control brain. Incubation of brain proteins, transferred onto nitrocellulose paper, with alkaline phosphatase had either no effect or slightly increased the antibody binding to tau proteins from both brain tissues. Immunoblots of tau-enriched preparations subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed no major changes in the staining pattern of tau isoforms in Alzheimer samples except for a weaker reactivity of the basic isovariants as compared to non-Alzheimer samples. The elution volume of tau from Alzheimer brain supernatant on a Sepharose CL-6B column was similar to that from non-Alzheimer brain and equal to that of aldolase (Mr = 158,000). Our data suggest that most of tau proteins from both types of brain have similar biochemical properties. The reduction in tau reactivity in Alzheimer tissue may be due to a reduction in neuronal cell population or incorporation of soluble tau into stable structures such as neurofibrillary tangles, since the tangles have been shown to react with anti-tau antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1597623702,"The of the Ca2+-dependent, alkaline pH optimum, membrane-bound phospholipase A2 from the P388D1 macrophage-like cell line were studied using various phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) substrates. This enzyme exhibits surface dilution kinetics toward PC in Triton X-100 mixed micelles, and the phospholipid was found to adequately describe its kinetic behavior. With substrate in the form of sonicated vesicles, the dual phospholipid model should give rise to Michaelis-Menten type kinetics. However, the hydrolysis of dipalmitoyl-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-PC, and 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-PC vesicles exhibited two distinct activities. Below 10 microM, the data appeared to follow Michaelis-Menten behavior, while at higher concentrations, the data could best be fit to a Hill equation with a Hill coefficient of 2. These PCs had Vmax values for the low substrate concentration range of 0.2-0.6 nmol min-1 mg-1 and Km values of 1-2 microM. At the high substrate concentration range, the Vmax values were between 5 and 7 nmol min-1 mg-1. PC containing unsaturated fatty acids had an apparent Km, determined from the Hill equation, of about 15 microM, while the apparent Km of dipalmitoyl-PC was 0.6 microM. When 70% glycerol was included in the assays, a single Michaelis-Menten curve was obtained for both dipalmitoyl-PC and 1-stearoyl,2-arachidonoyl-PC. Possible explanations for these kinetic results include reconstitution of the membrane-bound phospholipase A2 in the phospholipid vesicle or the enzyme has tow distinct phospholipid binding function. The for both dipalmitoyl-PC and dipalmitoyl-PE hydrolysis in vesicles was very similar, indicating that the enzyme does not greatly prefer one of these head groups over the other. The enzyme also showed no preference for arachidonoyl containing phospholipid. Enzymatic activity toward PC containing saturated fatty acids was linear to about 15% hydrolysis while the hydrolysis of PC containing unsaturated fatty acids was linear to only about 5%. This loss of linearity was due to inhibition by released unsaturated fatty acids. Arachidonic acid was found to be a competitive inhibitor of dipalmitoyl PC hydrolysis with a K1 of 5 microM. This tight binding suggests a possible in vivo regulatory role for arachidonic acid. Three compounds of the arachidonic acid cascade, prostaglandin F2 alpha, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and thromboxane B2, showed no inhibition of enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1513187638,"We have shown that interleukin 1 (IL 1) suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced progesterone secretion and 125I-labeled human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) binding (a measurement of LH receptors) in cultured rat granulosa cells. The present study was designed to examine if the reduction of FSH-stimulated 125I-labeled hCG binding by IL 1 was caused by a decline in the binding capacity or by an alteration in the affinity of the LH receptor and, further, to determine the minimum period of exposure of the granulosa cells to IL 1 necessary to suppress 125I-labeled hCG binding. IL 1 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of 125I-labeled hCG binding in FSH-stimulated granulosa cells. Scatchard analysis revealed that this effect resulted from a reduction of the binding capacity of the LH receptor with no change in affinity. Also, a minimum of 12-24 h of exposure to IL 1 is necessary to significantly inhibit FSH-induced LH receptor formation. These results suggest that IL 1 decreases the number of LH receptors and that protein synthesis may be necessary for IL 1's action. However, a physiological/pathological role for IL 1 in ovarian regulation has yet to be established.—Gottschall, P. E.; Katsuura, G.; Hoffmann, S. T; Arimura, A.

https://openalex.org/W2069592391,"To study the function of the proto-oncogene c-fos in hematopoietic tissues, transgenic mice were generated that express c-fos from the H2-Kb promoter in several organs. These H2-c-fos mice have enlarged spleens and hyperplastic thymuses containing an increased number of thymic epithelial cells. The exogenous c-fos expression specifically affects T cell development in the thymus, thereby increasing the fraction of mature thymocytes. Results obtained with bone marrow radiation chimeras suggest that the altered distribution of T cell subsets is not a direct effect of c-fos expression within the T cell lineage. No changes in the proportion of hematopoietic cell lineages are seen in the spleen, and these mice do not develop lymphoid malignancies. B and T cell function, however, is impaired, and H2-c-fos mice are immune deficient. It appears that c-fos specifically stimulates the proliferation of thymic epithelial cells, and may thus indirectly affect T cell development."
https://openalex.org/W1533294856,"When icosanoid-producing cells are stimulated by an agonist, 2-10% of total cellular arachidonate is released from phospholipids, and a variable percentage of the released arachidonate is subsequently converted into icosanoids. We used a mouse fibrosarcoma cell line (HSDM1C1) which synthesizes prostaglandin E2 in response to bradykinin stimulation to address the following questions: 1) upon cell stimulation is newly incorporated arachidonate preferentially released from phospholipids over previously incorporated arachidonate and 2) is there a corresponding change in phospholipid or membrane compartmentation of arachidonate to explain preferential release of newly incorporated arachidonate? To study changes in the availability of arachidonate for release from phospholipids, we incubated HSDM1C1 cells with 0.67 microM [14C]arachidonate for 15 min and chased the pulse of radiolabeled arachidonate with normal serum fatty acids. We found that of the [14C]arachidonate incorporated into phospholipids during the 15-min pulse, the percent released upon stimulation decreased nearly 3-fold from 8.9 +/- 0.5% at 5 min of chase to 3.6 +/- 0.2% (mean +/- S.E., n = 6, P less than 0.001) after only 60 min of chase. Percent release of arachidonate from nonpulsed controls was 3-4%. Although arachidonate release from phospholipids decreased significantly after 60 min of chase, the arachidonate which was released always originated predominantly from phosphatidylinositol. There was no decrease in the activities of enzymes required for arachidonate release during this time period. We also observed that throughout the period of the chase, the radiolabeled arachidonate remained esterified to the same phospholipid class into which it was initially incorporated (approximately 40% of [14C]arachidonate in diacyl phosphatidylcholine, 40% in phosphatidylinositol, and 15% in diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine. In cell fractionation experiments, we found that after 1-3 h of chase, [14C]arachidonate decreased in subcellular fractions containing nuclei, as it became progressively unavailable for release from phospholipids. Thus, our results indicate that 1) upon cell stimulation, the most recently incorporated pool of arachidonate, which is in high concentration in the nuclear membrane, is preferentially released and that 2) arachidonate rapidly moves out of the nuclear membrane into a less releasable pool while remaining esterified to the phospholipid moiety into which it was initially incorporated. This study indicates that the subcellular compartmentation of arachidonate has a marked influence on the cellular metabolism of arachidonate."
https://openalex.org/W1589871776,"The expression of cytochromes P450b and P450e genes was studied in the small intestinal mucosa of rats using a cDNA which recognizes the mRNAs of both cytochromes as well as oligonucleotide probes which are able to differentiate between the two gene products. Animals were treated with oral and intraperitoneal doses of phenobarbital, gamma-chlordane, trans-non-achlor, and polychlorinated and polybrominated biphenyls. RNA was extracted from small intestinal mucosa and liver. After treatment with each of the compounds, P450b mRNA was markedly induced in small intestinal mucosa and in liver. The greatest degree of induction was found in mucosa of the proximal small intestine where P450b mRNA levels were 4-6-fold higher than levels found in the distal small intestine. This distribution of P450b mRNA was not dependent on the route of administration of inducers. In contrast, although P450e mRNA was induced in the liver after treatment, P450e mRNA in the small intestine did not increase in response to any of the administered inducers. The location of the P450b mRNA within the intestinal mucosa following treatment with inducers was studied by in situ hybridization; the message was induced predominantly in enterocytes located in intestinal villi. These data indicate that the P450b gene is induced in the small intestine following treatment with various xenobiotics and that this induction may be secondary to either transcriptional activation of the gene or to mRNA stabilization in enterocytes located in the villi of the intestinal mucosa. The differential induction of P450b versus P450e genes in the small intestine and liver indicates that the regulation of these closely linked genes is tissue-specific. Furthermore, the marked induction of P450b mRNA in response to the administered xenobiotics indicates that this isoenzyme may have an important biological role in the small intestinal metabolism of environmental toxicants and drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1588661090,"Tumor-promoting phorbol esters and histamine induce tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) release from human endothelial cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) increased tPA concentration in the culture medium by eight to 12 times after 24 h with half-maximal stimulation at 13 and 55 nM, respectively. Maximum release by histamine was only half that of the phorbol esters and required 18 microM for half-maximal response. Kinetics of enhanced release was similar with both types of agonists: a 4-h lag period followed by a period of rapid release (4 h in PMA-treated and 10 h in histamine-treated cultures) followed by a decline toward pretreatment rates. The PMA and histamine effects were additive while histamine and thrombin, which also stimulates tPA release in human endothelial cells, were no more effective together than they were alone. Exposure of the cells to PMA, PDBu, or phorbol 12,13-didecanoate caused a loss of responsiveness to second treatment of the homologous agent that was time- and dose-dependent, sustained, and specific to active tumor promoters (half-maximal desensitization = 52 nM PDBu). A partial desensitized state was also established by histamine which resulted in a 60% lower response to a second challenge dose. Histamine-induced desensitization did not interfere with the PMA response. However, PMA-induced desensitization caused a 75% loss of the histamine and a 67% loss of the thrombin effects. These studies indicate that tumor promoters are potent agonists of tPA release from human endothelial cells and establish a desensitized state to further stimulation. Treatment of these cells with histamine has similar effects which may be mediated at least in part by pathways common to phorbol ester stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2055986145,"Larvae of the treehole mosquito, Aedes sierrensis, release a waterborne factor that induces morphogenesis of one of their prey, the tetrahymenid ciliate Lambornella clarki. Induced free-living trophonts of L. clarki undergo a synchronous response in which cells divide and transform into parasitic cells (theronts) that encyst on larval predators. Parasitic ciliates penetrate the cuticle, enter the hemocoel, and ultimately kill their predator-host. In nature, this trophic shift can lead to predator extinction and dramatic changes in microbial populations. Facultative parasitism by this polymorphic ciliate may have evolved as an antipredator strategy. The experimentally inducible parasitic response of L. clarki provides a novel model for studying cellular morphogenesis of ciliated protozoa."

This fragment was also found to persist in microtubules when microtubules consisting of tau proteins and tubulin were digested by chymotrypsin. Analysis of amino acid composition revealed that CT14 was rich in lysine and proline residues, suggesting unique structure of microtubule-binding domain of tau proteins. Amino-terminal sequence of CT14 was determined to be Ser-Ser-Pro-Gly-Ser-Pro-Gly-Thr-Pro-Gly-Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-X-Pro-Ser-Leu-Pr o. No heterogeneity was detected in this amino-terminal sequence of 19 residues. Five species of polypeptides consisting of tau proteins were separated from each other by gel electrophoresis and subjected to chymotryptic digestion. CT14 was produced from each of the tau polypeptides by chymotryptic digestion, indicating that all tau polypeptides have a common microtubule-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1541934122,"We have studied the biosynthesis of mucin glycoproteins recognized by monoclonal antibody W1 in MCF7 cells. Proteins of Mr 170,000, 185,000, 260,000, and 275,000 were immunoprecipitated from cells pulse-labeled with [3H]threonine and [3H]proline. Evidence suggesting that these proteins were precursors of high molecular weight mucin(s) included: 1) their kinetics of disappearance corresponded with appearance of mature mucin(s) (t1/2 = 30 min); 2) their processing into mature mucin(s) was not blocked by cycloheximide, but was disrupted by monensin, which impairs glycoprotein processing in the Golgi; 3) they were inaccessible to antibody added outside the cells, whereas mature mucin(s) was accessible and appeared at the cell surface with a t1/2 = 45 min; and 4) their mobilities of precursors varied between different cell lines, but generally correlated with mobilities of mature mucin(s). The precursors were sensitive to endoglycosidase H, indicating that they contained high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides. Less than 3% of threonine residues in the precursors, but more than 75% in mature mucin(s), were substituted with O-linked oligosaccharides. Therefore, initiation of N-linked oligosaccharides occurred soon after initiation of core protein synthesis, but initiation of O-linked oligosaccharides occurred much later, just prior to appearance of mature mucin(s) at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1527058097,"1-Monooleoylglycerol (MOG), a recently reported diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor (Bishop, W. R., Ganong, B. R., and Bell, R. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6993-7000), exerts potent stimulatory effects on [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and glucose transport in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. MOG induces a rapid and sustained 2.5-fold increase in the cellular 1,2-diacylglycerol (1,2-DG) content, and phosphorylation of an acidic 80-kDa protein, a putative substrate for the protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase). The effect of MOG is additive to that of bombesin in terms of both an increase in tissue diacylglycerol content and phosphorylation of the 80-kDa proteins. In addition to these effects, MOG potently stimulates release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids. Inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase have little effect, if any, on MOG-induced stimulation of glucose transport and DNA synthesis, while exogenously applied arachidonic readily stimulates both of these cellular responses. Furthermore, arachidonic acid, at its biologically active concentrations, is found to induce a rapid and sustained increase in cellular 1,2-DG content and stimulate the phosphorylation of the 80-kDa protein, although to a lesser extent than MOG. Prolonged pretreatment of the cells with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, which reduces the cellular protein kinase C content, markedly attenuates the effects of both MOG and arachidonic acid on glucose transport and DNA synthesis. These data indicate that MOG increases endogenous 1,2-DG content and thereby acts as a potent activator of protein kinase C, and that activation of protein kinase C is a crucial step in MOG-induced stimulation of mitogenesis and glucose transport."

The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if this novel mechanism of regulation is universal for the regulation of nitrate respiration in other widely divergent species of bacteria. Nitrate transport by whole cell suspensions was completely and reversibly inhibited in 11 out of 12 species tested, whereas nitrate reduction by cell-free extracts was not affected by oxygen or was only partially inhibited in some cases. These results indicate that oxygen inhibition of nitrate uptake is a general regulatory phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1496676768,"Proteoglycan (PG) metabolism by aortic smooth muscle cell cultures derived from atherosclerosis-susceptible White Carneau (WC) and -resistant Show Racer (SR) pigeons was compared using [35S]sodium sulfate and [3H]serine or [3H]glucosamine as labeling precursors. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) PG and dermatan sulfate (DS) PG were the major PG secreted into the medium by both cell types. Total PG production, whether measured by incorporation of radiolabel into either core protein or glycosaminoglycan chains, was consistently lower in WC compared to SR cultures at several time points. This difference was due in part to lower (30-37%) PG synthesis in WC cells, but degradation of newly synthesized PG was an important contributor. A pulse-chase study indicated that of the total radiolabeled PG present at time O, only 47% was present at 24 h in WC cultures compared to 88% in SR cultures. The large CS-PG appeared to be the primary target for degradation in WC cells, and this selective processing resulted in a higher DS-PG:CS-PG ratio in these cultures. Structural studies indicated similar core protein and glycosaminoglycan chain sizes within a PG type for both cell types. PG monomer composition differed, however, by a higher sulfation of WC CS-PG compared to SR CS-PG and by a disaccharide sulfation position favoring 6-sulfation in WC PG and 4-sulfation in SR PG."
https://openalex.org/W1575596796,"DNase I and 1,10-phenanthroline-copper are two nucleolytic activities which are sequence-dependent in their scission reaction yet are not nucleotide-specific at their site of cutting. When these two nucleases are used to digest identical sequences in 18-base pair oligonucleotides and in restriction fragments 10-fold longer, the digestion patterns are similar at sequence positions in the interior of the fragment. Changes in reactivity to 1,10-phenanthroline-copper associated with mutational changes in the lac promoter in biochemically functional restriction fragments are duplicated in 18-base pair oligonucleotides. The structural variability of a given DNA sequence detected by these conformationally sensitive nucleolytic activities is therefore encoded in local sequence and not sensitive to fragment length. Digestion patterns of a repeated 7-base pair sequence within a longer sequence have the same characteristic except for the two nucleotides at the 5' periphery of the direct repeat. This conclusion is based on the digestion pattern of a restriction fragment which contains the polyadenylation site of the mouse immunoglobulin mu heavy chain gene. Two pairs of different 7-base pair sequences repeated in this fragment retain their distinctive digestion patterns. DNA sequences which comprise the binding sites of regulatory proteins, retain a characteristic structure only influenced at their peripheries by two to three bases of the flanking sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1581959763,"In Rhodospirillum rubrum, the genes coding for the alpha and beta polypeptides of the B880 antenna (pufA,B) and the L and M polypeptides of the photoreaction center (pufL,M) are clustered on operon puf. In oxygen-limited cells, the puf mRNA is present as species of 2561, 640, and 617 nucleotides. Aerated cells contain only traces of these mRNAs. The large mRNA encodes the alpha,beta, L, and M polypeptides, whereas the small mRNAs encode only alpha and beta. S1 nuclease protection mapping showed these transcripts to have a common 5' end, immediately downstream of a region of dyad symmetry and at 166 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon of pufB. The 3' termini of the small transcripts are located in the intercistronic region between pufA and pufL, downstream of another region of dyad symmetry. This region is highly conserved in Rhodospirillum rubrum, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides and shares 61% sequence similarity with the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences of Escherichia coli. The slightly heterogeneous 3' termini of the large transcript are downstream of a region of dyad symmetry characteristic of rho-independent transcription termination. Following a shift from oxygen-limited to aerated conditions, the pufL,M and the pufA,B mRNAs decayed with respective half-lives of 9 and 20 min. These high relative stabilities, attributed to secondary structure, are in accord with the mole ratio (2:1) of the pufA,B/pufL,M messages. While the differential expression of alpha,beta/L,M congruent to 15 is thought to be due, in part, to this relative stability, the main factor may be a more efficient translation initiation for pufA,B than for pufL,M."
https://openalex.org/W1515470270,"Abstract During aging there is a decrease in activity of the malic enzyme in rat liver. The malic enzyme is about 36% less active than the enzyme. Some properties and modifications of amino acid residues are studied here (--SH, arginine, methionine, histidine, lysine) to try and check on the existence of any relationship between them and the loss of enzymatic activity during aging. Diethyl pyrocarbonate measurements indicate that the old enzyme has 1 histidine residue less than the young enzyme. Moreover, the treatment of the young enzyme with ascorbate for 15 min produces the loss of 36% of the enzymatic activity and the loss of 1.2 histidine residues. These results suggest that during aging the modification of the histidine residue could be involved in the loss of its enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1586559331,"Abstract Monkey kidney cells (COS-1), transfected with full-length human von Willebrand factor (vWF) cDNA encoding the precursor of vWF (pro-vWF), mimic the characteristics of the biosynthesis and of the constitutive secretory pathway, displayed by cultured vascular endothelial cells. Such heterologous transfected cells are able to cleave pro-vWF, generating the propolypeptide and mature vWF, and to assemble pro-vWF dimers into a series of multimers, similarly to endothelial cells. Evidence is presented showing that proteolytic processing of pro-vWF by COS-1 cells occurs at the peptide bond between arginine and serine in the sequence Lys762-Arg763-Ser764, identical to endothelial cell-associated proteolysis. This conclusion stems from the observation that substitution of Arg763 by a glycine residue completely abolishes proteolytic processing. As a result, transfection of COS-1 with the mutant vWF-Gly763 cDNA does not significantly affect the multimeric organization of secreted vWF molecules. Consequently, we conclude that proteolytic processing of pro-vWF is not required for multimer formation. Pulse-chase labeling of COS-1 cells transfected with full-length vWF cDNA reveals pro-vWF exclusively in cell lysates, whereas both pro-vWF and mature vWF are encountered in the conditioned medium. These observations indicate that proteolytic processing of pro-vWF is a late event during intracellular routing of these molecules or may occur extracellularly."
https://openalex.org/W1594207700,"Glucose metabolism and its hormonal regulation have been investigated in isolated enterocytes from rat small intestine. About 70% of the glucose consumed by the cells was transformed into lactate, 5% into pyruvate, and 4% into alanine. The remaining 20% was oxidized. Among several tested gastrointestinal peptides and hormones, only vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was found to affect the metabolic fate of glucose. VIP (10(-7) M) induced a 40% inhibition of glucose oxidation without significant modification of either glucose uptake or production of lactate, pyruvate, and alanine. This acute inhibition was dose-dependent (Ki = 3.10(-11) M) and appeared to be dependent on the stimulation of cAMP production (K0.5 = 3.10(-9) M) since dibutyryl-cAMP and forskolin reproduced all the effects of VIP. Similar inhibition of cell respiration by VIP was observed when pyruvate, fructose, and dihydroxyacetone were used as substrates, while the oxidation of glutamine, ketone bodies, and octanoate was unaffected, suggesting that the peptide acts on pyruvate metabolism. The suppression of VIP effects by dichloroacetate (5 mM) and pyruvate (10 mM) and the significant decrease (18%) of the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex after incubation of the cells with the neuropeptide, support the hypothesis that the effects of VIP on glucose oxidation may occur through an inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The total suppression of the inhibitory effects of VIP by sodium 2-[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate, a potent inhibitor of long-chain fatty acid oxidation, suggests that VIP did not affect the pyruvate dehydrogenase directly, but more probably acted through modifications of fatty acid oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1491995000,"When Chinese hamster ovary cells are incubated with [terminal methylenes-3H]spermidine, radioactivity is incorporated into a single cellular protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4D (eIF-4D), through posttranslational synthesis of the amino acid hypusine (N epsilon-(4-amino-2-hydroxybuyly)lysine). The effect of spermidine depletion on this protein modification reaction was studied by high resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Factor eIF-4D containing both [3H]lysine and [3H]hypusine was detected as one of the major labeled cellular proteins on the fluorographic map of the proteins from Chinese hamster ovary cells that had been incubated with [3H]lysine. When these cells were depleted of spermidine by the use of DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine before addition of [3H]lysine, no radiolabeling of this mature eIF-4D (hypusine form, Mr approximately 18,000; pI approximately 5.3) occurred. Instead, a new radiolabeled protein (Mr 18,000; pI 5.1) that contained [3H]lysine but no [3H]hypusine or [3H]deoxyhypusine was seen. This protein was identified as an eIF-4D precursor by comparison of the two-dimensional map of its tryptic peptides with that of the tryptic peptides from [3H]lysine-labeled eIF-4D. Further comparisons also suggest that additional post-translational modification processes are involved in the biogenesis of eIF-4D."
https://openalex.org/W1567755706,"Chymosin C, an autolysis product of chymosin A, is not formed from chymosin B (Foltmann, B. (1966) C. R. Trav. Lab. Carlsberg 35, 143-231) even though chymosins A and B differ in only a single residue (residue 286 is Asp in chymosin A but is Gly in chymosin B). Autolysis of recombinant-derived chymosin A yielded chymosin C for structural analysis. N-terminal sequencing revealed two peptide chains in chymosin C, one of which begins with Gly43, the N terminus of chymosin A; the other begins with Asp289. C-terminal sequencing, peptide mapping, and amino acid analysis showed that chymosin A undergoes autolytic excision of Asp286–Glu287–Phe288 in yielding chymosin C. As predicted from the established disulfide pattern and verified by size-exclusion chromatography under denaturing conditions, no disulfide bond cross-links the two chymosin A fragments which comprise chymosin C. The N-terminal fragment (243 residues) is termed the C-protein, and the C-terminal fragment (77 residues) is termed the C-peptide. Studies with synthetic peptide analogues of relevant regions of the chymosin sequences suggested that Tyr285–Asp286 is the first chymosin A peptide bond hydrolyzed during chymosin C formation and that Tyr285–Gly286 in chymosin B is not cleaved. Cleavage of Phe288–Asp289, a bond which is present in both chymosins A and B, most likely occurs in the A form as a secondary event following nicking at Tyr285–Asp286. This explains why chymosin A gives rise to chymosin C, but chymosin B does not. Examination of the sequence of a prochymosin gene (Hidaka, M., Sasaki, K., Uozumi, T., and Beppu, T. (1986) Gene (Amst.) 43, 197-203) showed that the autolysis-sensitive region of the polypeptide is encoded by genomic DNA located at the end of one exon and at the beginning of the next. Thus, chymosin C illustrates the correlation of protease-sensitive regions of protein sequences with genomic splice junctions."

This sequence is highly conserved in all the biotin enzymes that have been sequenced (with the exception of acetyl-CoA carboxylase from chicken liver, which has Val in place of Ala). The role of Met-88 and Met-90 in specifying Lys-89 for biotination by synthetase was examined by site-directed mutagenesis. Genes of the 1.3S subunit coding for Thr-88, Leu-88, or Leu-90 were generated by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis and expressed in Escherichia coli. The mutated apo 1.3S subunits were isolated and the biotination by homogeneous synthetase from Propionibacterium shermanii was compared with that of the apo wild-type subunit. The Vmax for the apo mutants was the same as that for the apo wild type, but when Leu was substituted for Met-88 or Met-90, the Km for the mutant was lower than that of the wild-type or mutant Thr-88. The activity of the synthetase of E. coli was determined by an in vivo assay. During the early log phase of growth, a smaller portion of mutants Thr-88 and Leu-90 was biotinated than with the wild-type or mutant Leu-88. When the cultures progressed to stationary phase, mutants and the wild type were biotinated to the same extent.

https://openalex.org/W1580219650,"We have examined the membrane topography of cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured human fibroblasts. We fed the cells with radioacetate and then interrupted the biosynthetic pathway so as to trap labeled intermediates in their subcellular locations. We analyzed homogenates of human fibroblasts labeled biosynthetically from radioacetate by centrifugation to equilibrium on sucrose gradients. The following two methods were used to interrupt cholesterol biosynthesis: incubation at 10 degrees C and treatment with 4,4,10 beta-trimethyl-trans-decal-3 beta-ol, a specific inhibitor of oxidosqualene cyclase. Incubation at 10 degrees C caused the accumulation of radiolanosterol at the expense of cholesterol. The lanosterol appeared predominantly at an unusually buoyant density (20% (w/w) sucrose; d = 1.08 g/cm3) as well as at the density normally labeled at 37 degrees C (30% sucrose; d = 1.13 g/cm3). 4,4,10 beta-Trimethyl-trans-decal-3 beta-ol treatment caused the accumulation of labeled squalene and squalene 2,3-oxide. Reversal of the block permitted the label to progress rapidly as a wave into lanosterol and ultimately into cholesterol. The profiles of the three precursors did not coincide, suggesting that they were mostly in different membranes. Squalene was uniquely confined to a density of 1.18 g/cm3 (40% sucrose) while squalene 2,3-oxide appeared in peaks of density 1.08 g/cm3 and 1.13 g/cm3 (20% and 30% sucrose). Lanosterol was in a peak of density 1.13 g/cm3. Pulse-chase experiments showed that lanosterol synthesized in the membranes at 20% sucrose moved rapidly to the membranes at 30% sucrose where it was converted to cholesterol. The density gradient profiles of the following organelle markers also were monitored: plasma membrane, cholesterol mass; Golgi apparatus, galactosyltransferase; endoplasmic reticulum, RNA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and cytochrome c reductase; peroxisomes, catalase. None of these markers appeared at the buoyant density of 1.08 g/cm3. We conclude that 1) cholesterol biosynthesis may be topographically heterogeneous and 2) newly synthesized squalene 2,3-oxide resides in a buoyant membrane fraction distinct from markers for the major organelles."

Evidence that the analog binds specifically at the ATP binding site includes the demonstration that glucose binding enhances PLP-AMP binding and that PLP-AMP and ATP bind competitively with an apparent Ki(PLP-AMP) = 23 microM. In addition, from the relationship between the degree of inhibition and extent of modification, it is estimated that the incorporation of 1 mol of PLP-AMP/mol of subunit is required for complete inhibition. Borohydride reduction of the Schiff's base complex formed between hexokinase and [3H]PLP-AMP gives a stable product. The reduced derivative was digested with trypsin and a single radioactive peptide was isolated by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequence analysis identified Lys-111 as the modified residue. Taking into account the known structures of the binary complexes (Shoham, M., and Steitz, T. A. (1980) J. Mol. Biol. 140, 1-14), the results suggest that Lys-111, located in the smaller of the two lobes of hexokinase, moves into the active site upon formation of the ternary complex."

This treatment had a minimal effect on enzyme activity; the turnover number with potassium ferricyanide was 45,300 in the native reductase and 39,200 in the derivative. Subsequent reaction with [3H]acetic anhydride after the removal of NADH resulted in the loss of 91% of the enzyme activity and the incorporation of 1.9 eq of acetyl groups into the protein. Treatment with 1 M hydroxylamine at pH 13 indicated that only lysine residues were acetylated, and fragmentation of the derivative with cyanogen bromide and subfragmentation with trypsin and chymotrypsin demonstrated that only Lys110 was labeled at high specific activity, with a stoichiometry of 0.83 acetyl groups/mol, in good agreement with the loss of enzyme activity observed. The remaining label was distributed at low levels among four or more additional lysine residues. These results demonstrate that only Lys110 is specifically protected by NADH and is therefore the residue which provides the epsilon-amino group implicated in NADH binding in cytochrome b5 reductase."

Purified SC polypeptides were subjected to mild periodate oxidation of terminal nonreducing sugars followed by selective reduction with [3H]sodium borohydride, SC polypeptides were further proteolytically cleaved, and the 3H-labeled peptides were isolated and characterized. Both high and low Mr SCs of the three allotypes possess a common glycosylation site at the asparagine residue position 400, whereas the second site, in the amino-terminal domain of SC, was found to be variable: the t61 and t63 allotypes contained a glycosylation site at positions 70 and 90, respectively. Moreover, although the t62 allotype was found to contain a triplet acceptor site (N-X-S) at positions 90-92, analyses showed that less than 30% of the t62 allotype peptides encompassing this region were glycosylated at residue 90. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of the t61 SC in the region of residues 69-90 varies by 8 and 10 amino acid substitutions when compared with the t62 and t63 allotype sequences, respectively. However, neither the variation in amino acid sequence nor the variation in degree or site of glycosylation measurably affected the non-covalent binding of domain 1 to dimeric IgA."

The modified protein bound the same number of Ca2+ ions as the native protein (six to seven), exhibited 28Mg2+-binding properties identical to native fragment 1 (five Mg2+ ions bound), exhibited the metal ion-promoted quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence in a manner similar to the native protein, but did not bind to phosphatidylserine (PS)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Modification of the bovine protein using [14C]formaldehyde-morpholine provided a 14C-labeled 3-gamma-MGlu-fragment 1 suitable for sequence analysis. Edman sequencing of the peptides released by a tryptic digest of the reduced and carboxymethylated bovine [14C]3-gamma-MGlu-fragment 1 indicated that Gla residues at positions 7, 8, and 33 had been converted to [14C]gamma-methyleneglutamyl residues. In addition Lys97 was found to contain a 14C label. Similar analysis of the human [14C]3-gamma-MGlu-fragment 1 indicated that Gla residues at positions 7 and 32 were major modification sites and that Gla residues at positions 6 and 14 were partially modified. Lysine 96 was also modified in the human protein. The incorporation of a 14C label at Lys97 in bovine 3-gamma-MGlu-fragment 1 protein is not responsible for the loss of Ca2+-promoted binding to PS/PC vesicles. We suggest that Gla residues 7, 8, and 33 are elements of the first Ca2+-binding site; occupancy of this site establishes the Ca2+-specific conformation which is essential for the Ca2+-promoted interaction of the bovine protein with PS/PC vesicles. These studies also suggest that the loss of Gla residues at positions 7 and 32 prevents the formation of the initial Ca2+-binding site in the human protein."

Crystals shaped as rectangular plates demonstrate 4/mmm Laue symmetry and systematic absences consistent with the space group I422. They have cell dimensions of a = b = 153 A and c = 181 A. Octahedrally shaped crystals of mandelate racemase display 4/m Laue symmetry and systematic absences consistent with the space group 14. Cell dimensions for these crystals are a = b = 113 A and c = 124 A. Based on estimates of Vm and on the measured density of the 1422 form, we suggest that two subunits of mandelate racemase (38,570 daltons/subunit) occupy the asymmetric unit in both crystal forms. Crystals of both forms diffract to beyond 3.0-A resolution. We are currently screening for isomorphous heavy-atom derivatives."

The gene designed for mutagenesis codes for a receptor protein where all 10 methionines are substituted by alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. In addition, aspartate at position 6 is substituted by glutamate. This desmethionine IL-2R alpha and the wild-type IL-2R alpha genes were integrated into a eukaryotic expression vector and transferred into different cell lines. The recipient cell lines express both wild-type and mutant receptor proteins on their cell surfaces which are recognized equally by different monoclonal antibodies. It was possible to establish cell lines with high level IL-2R alpha chain expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The wild-type IL-2R alpha expressed in LTK- cells is a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular size of about 60 kDa and a typical low interleukin-2 binding affinity of KD = 12 nM. Despite the fact that 11 amino acids are altered, no significant difference in the mutant IL-2R alpha is observed, exhibiting the same molecular size and a low interleukin-2 binding affinity of KD = 26 nM."

https://openalex.org/W1549096626,"Pepsin-catalyzed transpeptidation was studied by high resolution 75 MHz 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Enrichment with 13C at the carbonyl carbons of the substrates Leu-Tyr-NH2 and Leu-Leu-NH2 facilitated detection and identification of the transpeptidation and hydrolysis products of enzymic action. Porcine pepsin was found in each case to synthesize and release the tetrapeptide Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu as the primary product of transpeptidation, the longest oligomeric product of transpeptidation observed to date. Productive binding of the dipeptide substrates into the active site groove of pepsin required an induction period of several minutes. Quenching experiments suggested the presence of strongly bound intermediate forms of Leu and Leu-Leu prior to observation of any enzyme-free products. The finding of the tetrapeptide as a primary product is discussed as an instance where transpeptidation of the tripeptide competes successfully with the action of pepsin subsite S3 as a trigger for product release."
https://openalex.org/W2159004200,"A reagent and a derivatization procedure have been developed which result in trimesylation of all -OH and -NH2 groups on proteins: serine, threonine, tyrosine, and lysine side chains are all completely derivatized. The parameters affecting the kinetics of trimesylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine peptides were studied using dinitrophenylated peptides as model systems. Conditions for solubilization of proteins in anhydrous organic solvents for the derivatization are described; removal of blocking groups results in the polar, highly water-soluble protein derivative which behaves as a monomer during gel permeation chromatography in simple aqueous buffers even in the absence of detergents. Synthesis of the tritiated reagent is described, and this reagent was used to monitor the protein derivatization."
