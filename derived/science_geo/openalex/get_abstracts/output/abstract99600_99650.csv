https://openalex.org/W2040838085,"CD4 T helper precursor cells mature along two alternative pathways, Th1 and Th2. Here we show that these pathways are differentially activated by two costimulatory molecules, B7-1 and B7-2. Using anti-B7 antibodies, this developmental step was manipulated both in vitro and in vivo in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Anti-B7-1 reduced the incidence of disease while anti-B7-2 increased disease severity. Neither antibody affected overall T cell induction but rather altered cytokine profile. Administration of anti-B7-1 at immunization resulted in predominant generation of Th2 clones whose transfer both prevented induction of EAE and abrogated established disease. Since co-treatment with anti-IL-4 antibody prevented disease amelioration, costimulatory molecules may directly affect initial cytokine secretion. Thus, interaction of B7-1 and B7-2 with shared counterreceptors CD28 and CTLA-4 results in very different outcomes in clinical disease by influencing commitment of precursors to a Th1 or Th2 lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2018027744,"Abstract Structural similarity between viral T cell epitopes and self-peptides could lead to the induction of an autoaggressive T cell response. Based on the structural requirements for both MHC class 11 binding and TCR recognition of an immunodominant myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide, criteria for a data base search were developed in which the degeneracy of amino acid side chains required for MHC class 11 binding and the conservation of those required for T cell activation were considered. A panel of 129 peptides that matched the molecular mimicry motif was tested on seven MBP-specific T cell clones from multiple sclerosis patients. Seven viral and one bacterial peptide efficiently activated three of these clones. Only one peptide could have been identified as a molecular mimic by sequence alignment. The observation that a single T cell receptor can recognize quite distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2128509983,"Of the several families of adhesion receptors involved in leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions, only the selectins have been shown to initiate leukocyte interaction under physiologic shear; indeed, beta 2 (CD18) intergrins responsible for neutrophil arrest are unable to engage without prior selectin-mediated rolling. In contrast, alpha 4 (CD49d) integrins are shown here to initiate lymphocyte contract (""tethering"") in vitro under shear and in the absence of a selectin contribution. The alpha 4 integrin ligands MAdCAM-1 and VCAM-1 support loose reversible interactions including rolling, as well as rapid sticking and arrest that is favored following integrin activation. Moreover, alpha 4 beta 7 mediates L-selectin (CD62L)-independent attachment of blood-borne lymphocytes to lamina propria venules in situ. Scanning electron microscopy of alpha 4 beta 7hi lymphoid cells reveals that, like L-selectin, alpha 4 beta 7 is highly concentrated on microvillous sites of initial cellular contact, whereas the beta 2 integrin LFA-1 is excluded from villi. Thus, alpha 4 but not beta 2 integrins can initiate leukocyte adhesion under flow, a capacity that may be in part a function of topographic presentation on microvilli."
https://openalex.org/W2037261940,"In rat neostriatal neurons, D1 dopamine receptors regulate the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). The influence of these signaling elements on high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents was studied using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. The application of D1 agonists or cyclic AMP analogs reversibly reduced N- and P-type Ca2+ currents. Inhibition of PKA antagonized this modulation, as did inhibition of PP1, suggesting that the D1 effect was mediated by a PKA enhancement of PP1 activity directed toward Ca2+ channels. In a subset of neurons, D1 receptor-mediated activation of PKA enhanced L-type currents. The differential regulation of HVA currents by the D1 pathway helps to explain the diversity of effects this pathway has on synaptic integration and plasticity in medium spiny neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2084702672,"The mechanism of inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by three nonnucleoside inhibitors is described. Nevirapine, O-TIBO, and CI-TIBO each bind to a hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme-DNA complex close to the active site catalytic residues. Pre-steady-state kinetic analysis was used to establish the mechanism of inhibition by these noncompetitive inhibitors. Analysis of the pre-steady-state burst of DNA polymerization indicated that inhibitors blocked the chemical reaction, but did not interfere with nucleotide binding or the nucleotide-induced conformational change. Rather, in the presence of saturating concentrations of the inhibitors, the nucleoside triphosphate bound tightly (Kd, 100 nM), but nonproductively. The data suggest that an inhibitor combining the functionalities of a nonnucleoside inhibitor and a nucleotide analog could bind very tightly and specifically to reverse transcriptase and could be effective in the treatment of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2027998343,"CD40 is a receptor on the surface of B lymphocytes, the activation of which leads to B cell survival, growth, and differentiation. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a gene, CRAF1, encoding a protein that interacts directly with the CD40 cytoplasmic tail through a region of similarity to the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor-associated factors. Overexpression of a truncated CRAF1 gene inhibited CD40-mediated up-regulation of CD23. A region of CRAF1 was similar to the TNF-alpha receptor-associated factors TRAF1 and TRAF2 and so defined a shared TRAF-C domain that was necessary and sufficient for CD40 binding and homodimerization. The CRAF1 sequence also predicted a long amphipathic helix, a pattern of five zinc fingers, and a zinc ring finger. It is likely that other members of the TNF receptor superfamily use CRAF-related proteins in their signal transduction processes."

https://openalex.org/W2065810182,"c-Mpl is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, expressed primarily on hematopoietic cells. Recently, the c-Mpl ligand was cloned and found to have thrombopoietic activity. In this paper we report that ligand binding induced tyrosine phosphorylation in BaF3 cells engineered to express the murine Mpl receptor (BaF3/mMpl). Phosphorylation occurred within 1 min at cytokine concentrations sufficient for proliferation of receptor-bearing cells. Using specific antibodies for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, several of these phosphorylated proteins were identified. Shc and Jak2, known cytokine signaling molecules, and the c-Mpl receptor were shown to be major substrates for tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, phospholipase C-γ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase displayed little and no tyrosine phosphorylation, respectively, after thrombopoietin stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that Jak2 became physically associated with c-Mpl relatively late in the observed time course (20-60 min), significantly later than tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 (1-5 min). These results suggest that c-Mpl induces signal transduction pathways similar to those of other known cytokines. Additionally, in light of its late physical association with c-Mpl following ligand binding, Jak2 may not be the initiating tyrosine kinase in the thrombopoietin-induced signaling cascade. c-Mpl is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily, expressed primarily on hematopoietic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2023424326,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor with sequence-specific DNA binding activity that is thought to be important for the growth-inhibitory function of p53. DNA binding appears to require activation of a cryptic form of p53 by allosteric mechanisms involving a negative regulatory domain at the carboxyl terminus of p53. The latent form of p53, reactive to the carboxyl-terminal antibody PAb421, is produced in a variety of eukaryotic cells, suggesting that activation of p53 is an important rate-limiting step in vivo. In this report we provide evidence that phosphorylation of serine 378 within the carboxyl-terminal negative regulatory domain of the human p53 protein by protein kinase C correlates with loss of PAb421 reactivity and a concomitant activation of sequence-specific DNA binding. These effects are reversed by subsequent dephosphorylation of the protein kinase C-reactive site by protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), which restore the reactivity of p53 to PAb421 and regenerate the latent form of p53 lacking significant DNA binding activity.

Inactivation or loss of p53 is a common event associated with the development of human cancers. Inactivation of p53, resulting from mutations within the p53 gene, or interaction of the p53 protein with viral and cellular oncogenes, is intimately associated with tumorigenesis(1Levine A.J.

At the cellular level, loss or inactivation of wild type p53 leads to deregulation of the cell cycle and DNA replication, inefficient DNA repair, loss of cellular apoptotic responses, selective growth advantage, and, consequently, tumor formation.

Its ability to act as a transcription factor has been particularly well studied, both as a transactivator and repressor of gene expression. Transactivation by p53 is sequence-specific and correlates with its binding to DNA sequences that are similar to or identical with the recently reported consensus binding site(16El-Deiry W.S.

Most oncogenic mutants of p53 have lost their ability to function effectively as transcription regulators, suggesting that these activities of p53 may be critical to its tumor suppressor function. Alternatively, chimeric p53 proteins with foreign transactivation and/or dimerization domains inhibit cell growth, indicating that conservation of the central region of p53, mediating sequence-specific DNA binding, is sufficient and necessary to confer growth-suppressive function to such hybrid proteins(30Pietenpol J.A.

This suggests that DNA binding and activation of p53 target genes is an important step in p53-mediated tumor suppression. The DNA binding domain of p53 is located in the core region of the molecule(31Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 32Wang Y. Reed M. Wang P. Stenger J.E. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P.

Regulation of DNA binding activity is mediated by the dimerization and tetramerization domains within the carboxyl terminus of p53 and by a regulatory domain within the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids that has been implicated in negative autoregulation of sequence-specific DNA binding(35Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 45Chung, R., 1992, A Bifunctional Transcriptional Regulatory Protein Inactivated in Human Astrocyte Tumors. Ph.D. thesis, Harvard University, Boston, MA.Google Scholar). Cellular p53 is phosphorylated at amino- and carboxyl-terminal sites(36Meek D.W. Street A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggesting that kinases and phosphatases may be involved in the regulation of p53 tumor suppressor function. A role for serine 389, a target site for casein kinase II, in murine p53-mediated growth suppression has been proposed(46Milne D.M. Palmer R.H. Meek D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5565-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of human p53 by casein kinase II has been shown to unmask the cryptic DNA binding activity of bacterial expressed p53(35Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), indicating that p53 is subject to positive regulation by post-translational modification and raising the possibility that such activation may be important for p53 growth suppressor function. In contrast, substitution of Ser-389 in murine p53 with aspartic acid has been reported to have no apparent effect on the DNA binding activity of in vitro translated p53 protein (47Rolley N. Milner J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3067-3070PubMed Google Scholar) and raised the question of whether phosphorylation of serine 389 by casein kinase II is important for murine p53 growth suppressor function via a mechanism which, however, is ancillary to sequence-specific DNA binding(47Rolley N. Milner J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3067-3070PubMed Google Scholar). More detailed studies appear required to clarify this issue. Most recently, murine p53 has been shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C(37Baudier J. Delphin C. Grimwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the site of phosphorylation and the functional consequences of such a modification are not known. Potential consensus target sites are located within the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids. Studying potential modifications at the carboxyl terminus of p53 are of particular interest, since loss of p53 reactivity to the carboxyl-terminal antibody PAb421 occurs in vivo upon growth arrest of glioblastoma cells as a result of overexpression of p53 (38Ullrich S.J. Mercer W.E. Appella E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1635-1643PubMed Google Scholar) and in resting lymphocytes(39Milner J. Nature. 1984; 310: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a correlation between loss of PAb421 reactivity and the growth suppressor function of p53. In this report we show that protein kinase C targets a serine(s) in the negative regulatory domain within the carboxyl-terminal basic region of the human p53 protein. Phosphorylation of this site is associated with the unmasking of cryptic p53, and, strikingly, loss of PAb421 reactivity occurs concurrently with activation of sequence-specific DNA binding. These effects are reversible, and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) 1The abbreviations used are: PPprotein phosphatasePKCprotein kinase CDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. or 2A (PP2A) restores PAb421 reactivity and regenerates the latent form of p53.

Human WTp53 or His-human WTp53-fusion proteins were generated by cloning of p53 cDNAs into the pBlueBac III or pBlueBacHis vectors (Invitrogen), respectively, and subsequent selection of recombinant baculoviruses. 48 h postinfection, extracts of infected Sf9 insect cells were prepared by sonication in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin at 5 μg/ml each). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, 4°C. Supernatant was chromatographed through a Q-Sepharose fast flow FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and eluted with a linear salt gradient in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50-500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT. Immunoblot analysis revealed the fractions containing p53. The Q-Sepharose p53 eluate, and, in certain cases, the cell lysate directly, was bound to an affinity column of Protein A-Sepharose beads, coupled to the monoclonal antibody PAb421, in a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 15% glycerol, 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM Na2S2O5, protease inhibitors (pepstatin A, aprotinin, and leupeptin) at 5 μ/ml each, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Bound p53 was eluted with a synthetic peptide encompassing the PAb421 epitope (NH2LKTKKGQSTSRHKK-COOH) at 0.1 mg/ml in the same buffer. Fractions containing p53 were pooled, separated from the peptide by chromatography through a gel filtration column (G-50), and dialyzed against 200 mM NaCl, 50% glycerol, 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors at 5 μg/ml, as above. p53 protein was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, whether or not the initial Q-Sepharose step was introduced. Thus, lysates were directly added to the PAb421 column in subsequent purifications. Baculovirus His-p53 fusion protein, or bacterial His-p53 protein generated by expression of p53 from a recombinant pET19 (Novagen) expression vector (kindly provided by N. Horikoshi, R. Zandomeni, and R. Weinmann), was purified by nickel affinity chromatography, essentially as described previously(32Wang Y. Reed M. Wang P. Stenger J.E. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). p53 proteins were >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Purified p53 protein was phosphorylated in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing: reaction buffer PK (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP, 0.8 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 0.28 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, Triton X-100 mixed micelles). Where indicated, peptides at 1 mM final concentration or monoclonal antibodies (100 ng) were present. Reactions were incubated at 30°C with purified (>97%) protein kinase C (a mixture of α, β, and γ isoforms; UBI). Where indicated, PKC peptide inhibitor was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 15 min at 30°C, in the absence or presence of purified protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A (UBI; 0.02 unit/reaction). Products were subsequently separated by electrophoresis in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Reactions containing peptides were separated through a step gradient polyacrylamide gel (up to 20%). Radioactivity incorporated into p53 was subsequently determined and expressed as moles of phosphate incorporated per mol of p53 protein. PAb421 peptide or purified His-p53 (2 μg) were phosphorylated with PKC, resolved by 10% or 25% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon membranes. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed essentially as described previously(40Boyle N.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Labeled peptide or p53 was hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl for 1 h at 110°C. Dried hydrolysates were resuspended in running buffer (pH 2.5) (5.9% glacial acetic acid, 0.8% formic acid (88%), 0.3% pyridine, and 0.3 mM EDTA) containing phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine standards. 32P-Amino acids were resolved by phosphocellulose-TLC using running buffer (pH 2.5)(41Jelinek T. Weber M. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 629-630Google Scholar). In these experiments, the consequence of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on the reactivity of p53 with monoclonal antibodies PAb421 and PAb1801, and the DNA binding activity of p53, were determined for one and the same p53 protein sample. p53 protein (1 μg) was incubated in 10 μl of kinase reaction buffer PK (see above), supplemented with 1 mM ATP, in the presence or absence of protein kinase C (0-20 ng) at 30°C for the indicated time periods (0-20 min) or 30 min in all subsequent experiments. Reactions were stopped by the addition of a peptide PKC inhibitor (Life Technologies, Inc.), and reaction volume was brought to 15 μl by the addition of phosphatase reaction buffer (10% glycerol, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 40 mM MgCl2). Reactions were further incubated at 30°C for 30 min in the presence or absence of phosphatases (purified PP1 (0.02 unit) or PP2A (0.02 unit, UBI)). Subsequently, 15 μl of ice cold Buffer BB (20% glycerol, 50 mM KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM DTT) were added (30 μl final), and samples were put on ice. Separate aliquots were then analyzed by immunoblotting (10 μl) or tested for DNA binding activity by electromobility gel shift assay (2 μl). p53 protein (1 μg) was incubated in 10 μl of phosphatase reaction buffer in the presence or absence of purified PP1 or PP2A (0.02 unit, UBI), for 30 min at 30°C. Ice cold buffer BB was added to the reaction (10 μl), and an aliquot (2 μl) of the samples was tested for DNA binding activity. Equal amounts of p53 protein (10 μl of reaction sample) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting, using as probes the monoclonal antibodies PAb421 or PAb1801. Approximately 60 ng of p53 protein (2 μl of reaction sample) were incubated in a final reaction volume of 20 μl containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 210 ng of poly(dI•dC) competitor, and 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded p53 DNA recognition sequence 5′-GGACATGCCCGGGCATGTC-3′(17Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE = 50 mM Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mM EDTA). Mutant oligonucleotide used for competition studies to confirm specificity of binding was altered in the second consensus sequence box to 5′-GGACATGCCCGGGCTTTTC-3′. In vitro translated proteins were expressed using SP6 transcribed RNA (0.1-1 μg) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Plasmid proSp53, encoding full-length wild type p53, was used as a template for in vitro transcription of full-length p53, and truncated versions of p53 were generated using DraII (p53 1-389) and StuI (p53 1-347) linearized p53 recombinant plasmids. Proteins were immunoprecipitated in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, using immobilized monoclonal antibody DO1 (agarose conjugate, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Monoclonal antibodies PAb1801 and PAb421 (Oncogene Science) and polyclonal antibody CM1 (Novocastra Laboratories) were used for Western blotting. Human p53 protein produced in Sf9 insect cells or bacteria was purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1A) and used in phosphorylation studies. Fig. 1B shows that p53 protein from either source is an effective substrate for protein kinase C (panels a and b) that is rapidly modified upon addition of the enzyme (panel c). Phosphorylation was reduced in the absence of Ca2+ and cofactors (data not shown). However, consistently, a low level of 32P-labeled p53 was detected even in the absence of added PKC (Fig. 1B, 0 ng PKC, panels a and b), when baculovirus produced p53, as opposed to bacterially produced p53, was used. This observation is similar to results previously reported for purified baculovirus-mouse p53 protein (37Baudier J. Delphin C. Grimwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and could be due to partial co-purification of a p53-associated kinase activity from insect cells. If so, however, the site of phosphorylation would be different from the site targeted by protein kinase C, as suggested by its relative insensitivity to protein phosphatases (see below, Fig. 3A).Figure 3:Protein kinase C and protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) modulate p53 reactivity to PAb421.

Lanes 5 and 6, effects of phosphatases on untreated p53 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At a molar ratio of p53/PKC of ∼250, more than 80% of the total incorporated phosphate is transferred within 3 min of the start of the reaction, indicating that p53 is an effective PKC substrate (Fig. 1B, panel c). PKC phosphorylation of unphosphorylated p53 produced in bacteria results in the incorporation of up to 0.9 mol of phosphate per mol of p53 and a ratio of ∼0.7 mol of phosphate per mol of p53 was calculated for p53 produced in insect cells. Similarly, incorporation of ∼0.65 mol of phosphate/mol of p53 was measured for the purified baculovirus His-p53 fusion protein. The presumed consensus target site for PKC phosphorylation in p53 is located at the carboxyl terminus and encompasses the PAb421 epitope (37Baudier J. Delphin C. Grimwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Several observations are consistent with a serine(s) in this region being targeted by PKC. Initial studies using monoclonal antibody DO1-immunoprecipitated in vitro translated full-length p53, or carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of the p53 protein (p53(1-389) and p53(1-347)), as substrates, indicated that phosphorylation occurs within the carboxyl-terminal 46 amino acids (relative 32P incorporation: wild type p53, 1.0; p53(1-389), 1.0; p53(1-147), <0.1. Equal amounts of p53 protein were used, as determined by Western blot analysis, not shown). Subsequently, purified p53 protein was used. Phosphorylation of purified baculovirus-p53 is inhibited by prior inclusion of the monoclonal antibody PAb421, which targets the carboxyl terminus of p53 (residues 370-378), but not PAb1801, which targets the amino terminus of p53 or PAb1620 (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation of purified p53 is also inhibited by co-incubation with a PAb421 epitope containing peptide (residues 369-382, NH2-LKTKKGQSTSRHKKCOOH) which is also effectively phosphorylated (Fig. 2A, lane 3), directly implicating this region as the potential target for phosphorylation by PKC (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, other carboxyl-terminal peptides covering residues 340-357, 369-382, and 389-393 (includes the casein kinase II site) do not compete as PKC substrates. Further analysis of the targeted region indicates that peptide NH2-TSRHKKL-COOH (residues 377-383) is still effectively phosphorylated by PKC (Fig. 2B). Site-specific mutations, including changes in residues 377 and 378 from threonine or serine to glycine, respectively, indicate that it is serine 378 that is phosphorylated (Fig. 2B), consistent with phosphoamino acid analysis of the phospho-PAb421 peptide which demonstrates that a serine is phosphorylated (Fig. 2C). Another p53 synthetic peptide (residues 372-379) encompassing serine 376 and containing glycine at positions 377 and 378, NH2-KKGQSGGR, was reproducibly not phosphorylated by PKC (data not shown). Importantly, as evidenced by phospho-p53 phosphoamino acid analysis, PKC also phosphorylates wild type p53 at a serine (Fig. 2C). Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that serine 378 within the PAb421 epitope of p53 is the predominant site phosphorylated by PKC. Concurrently to the analysis of the effects of PKC, we tested the effects of two protein phosphatases: protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Both enzymes target the serine in p53 which is phosphorylated by PKC; as shown in Fig. 3A, either purified phosphatase effectively dephosphorylates PKC-labeled phospho-p53 (lane 2 versus lanes 4 and 6). Neither phosphatase, however, significantly decreased the level of 32P incorporation associated with the incubation of p53 with labeled ATP in the absence of added protein kinase C (lane 1 versus lanes 3 and 5), an effect possibly mediated by a co-purified kinase activity other than protein kinase C. Since phosphorylation of p53 by PKC appears to occur within the PAb421 epitope, we tested as to whether this would affect the reactivity of p53 to PAb421. In light of the findings that the PAb421 epitope is targeted by PKC, we continued to use His-p53 protein purified by nickel affinity chromatography, rather than p53 purified by PAb421 affinity chromatography. Equal amounts of protein kinase C-treated p53 protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis using as probes either antibody PAb421 or PAb1801. Strikingly, phosphorylation of p53 by protein kinase C reduces the reactivity of p53 to PAb421 but not to PAb1801, a monoclonal antibody that targets the amino terminus of p53 (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus 2). That such a change in PAb421 reactivity is detected using denatured and immobilized p53 indicates that the specific loss in the ability of p53 to interact with PAb421 antibody can be attributed to a direct steric effect of the added phosphate. Prior incubation of the PKC-treated p53 protein with phosphatases PP1 or PP2A effectively restores subsequent PAb421 reactivity (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, treatment of non-PKC-treated purified p53 protein with PP1 or PP2A does not significantly increase the levels of PAb421-reactive p53 species (Fig. 3B, lane 5 versus lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that the major form of the isolated protein is nonphosphorylated at the PKC-reactive site. This is consistent with the observation that comparable levels of phosphate are incorporated into bacterial and baculovirus p53 proteins (Fig. 1). Previous reports suggested that bacterial, baculovirus, or in vitro translated p53 protein exists in tetrameric form and binds DNA predominantly as a tetramer or in forms of higher molecular weight complexes(34Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1994; 12: 5057-5064Crossref Google Scholar, 42Friedman P. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 43Hainaut P. Hall A. Milner J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 299-303PubMed Google Scholar, 48Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Activation of DNA binding by allosteric mechanisms involves the carboxyl terminus of p53 and can be triggered by the binding of the carboxyl-terminal antibody PAb421(35Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). First, we wished to determine how many molecules of monoclonal antibody PAb421 per presumed p53 tetramer are present in activated p53-DNA complexes, which would allow us to interpret the nature of possible PKC-modified phospho-p53-DNA complexes. Fig. 4A shows that purified p53, pretreated with PP1, binds DNA predominantly in the form of two or three complexes (similar to the non-PP1-treated p53); a fast migrating complex consisting of a p53 tetramer bound to DNA (p53t, see lane 2) and slower migrating complexes consisting of oligomeric forms of p53 bound to DNA (p53°, lane 2, e.g. associated tetramers?), consistent with previous reports (e.g.(42Friedman P. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) ). Inclusion of PAb421 leads to supershift of the p53t complex and an apparent disruption of oligomeric p53 complexes. In addition, PAb421 produces a pronounced activation of cryptic p53, as indicated by the increase in the levels of a PAb421-activated p53-DNA complex, p53t/Ab (lanes 3-9, see also, for example, Fig. 4C, lane 3), as previously reported for p53 protein produced in bacteria(35Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Interestingly, throughout a PAb421 titration (Fig. 4A, lanes 3-9), the p53t/Ab complex represents the apparent single predominant PAb421-p53-DNA complex that is formed. Only weak formation of a faster migrating apparent intermediate is detected. This suggests that the activated protein-DNA complex has a defined ratio of p53, DNA, and antibody molecules. Fig. 4A (lanes 10-16) shows the effects of adding PAb1801 on the formation of p53-DNA intermediates. In contrast to the effects observed with PAb421, addition of PAb1801 does not activate latent p53, but instead supershifts the p53t and p53o complexes and produces the formation of multiple p53-DNA intermediates. Only one intermediate (p53t/Ab1m) is formed upon supershift of the p53t complex with PAb1801. This is consistent with the PAb1801-saturated complex containing two bivalent molecules of antibody bound per p53 tetramer (p53t/Ab2m). Three intermediate complexes are formed upon supershift of the oligomeric p53-DNA complex p53o, consistent with it representing two associated p53 tetramers and the PAb1801-saturated complex having two molecules of bivalent antibody bound per p53 tetramer (p53o/Ab4m). The findings that PAb1801, unlike PAb421, does not prevent or disrupt the formation of oligomeric p53 bound to DNA is consistent with oligomerization being mediated by the basic carboxyl terminus of p53(44Sturzbecher H.-W. Brain R. Addison C. Rudge K. Remm M. Grimaldi M. Keenan E. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the migration of the PAb1801-induced p53t/Ab2m complex with that of the predominantly formed PAb421-p53-DNA complex, is consistent with two molecules of bivalent PAb421 being bound to p53 in the activated complex p53t/Ab. This is in agreement with the recent findings by Hupp and Lane(48Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), reported after submission of this manuscript, and is further supported by experiments using PKC-activated p53, as described below. In the light of recent findings implicating the carboxyl-terminal 30 (35Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) or carboxyl-terminal 18 residues (45Chung, R., 1992, A Bifunctional Transcriptional Regulatory Protein Inactivated in Human Astrocyte Tumors. Ph.D. thesis, Harvard University, Boston, MA.Google Scholar), 2R. Chung and N. Kley, unpublished observations. in the basic region of the p53 molecule as a negative autoregulatory domain, and, having established that PKC specifically phosphorylates p53 in this region, we tested as to whether phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of p53 are associated with a change in sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Purified p53 protein was subjected to phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation reactions as performed for antibody reactivity studies (see Fig. 3) and subsequently assayed for DNA binding. PKC effectively activates DNA binding of either the tetrameric or oligomeric forms of p53, although the increase in the levels of p53 tetramer bound to DNA is more pronounced (Fig. 4, B and C). This activation is dose-dependent (Fig. 4B); however, it does not exactly mirror the profile of the dose-dependent phosphorylation of p53 by PKC (see Fig. 1). This could reflect the requirement of a minimum number of p53 molecules in a p53 tetramer to be phosphorylated in order for the activation to occur, i.e. activation of DNA binding is not directly proportional to phosphorylation and may be regulated in a concerted manner, similar to activation of p53 by PAb421 which requires binding of more than one molecule of antibody. Addition of PAb421 (lanes 7-11), reveals a parallel decrease in the supershifted p53t/Ab2m complex, as well as an increase in the appearance of one novel PAb421-p53-DNA complex (p53t/Ab1m). The formation of this novel complex can be explained by the partial phosphorylation of a p53 tetramer and the resulting loss in PAb421 reactivity. The apparent formation of only one such intermediate complex is consistent with one molecule of bivalent antibody binding to the partially phosphorylated p53 tetramer and two molecules of PAb421 bound to nonphosphorylated p53, as previously suggested by experiments described above. The absence of the significant formation of the p53t/Ab1m complex upon addition of PAb421 to untreated p53 protein (lane 7, see also Fig. 4C, lane 3, and Fig. 4D) is further consistent with the p53 protein produced in insect cells not being significantly phosphorylated at the PKC reactive site. Phosphorylation at this site would be expected to reduce PAb421 reactivity. Additional observations can be made from multiple experiments of this type: the p53t/Ab1m complex can be generated from distinct phosphorylated p53 species. In most binding reactions, a significant fraction of the novel PAb421-p53 complex (p53t/Ab1m) appears to derive from the PKC-activated p53-DNA complex (p53t), which is partially supershifted by PAb421 (see Fig. 4C, lane 8 versus 9). However, a significant fraction of the novel PAb421-p53-DNA complex may also be generated by activation of a partially phosphorylated, but latent and PAb421-responsive p53 protein (similar to nonphosphorylated p53). This is indicated by the increase in p53t/Ab1m complex formation in the absence of a comparable loss of supershiftable p53t (see Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate that a partially phosphorylated p53 tetramer can be active in DNA binding, but that activation only occurs when more than one molecule of p53 in a p53 tetramer is phosphorylated. Alternatively, partial phosphorylation and binding of one molecule of pAb421 may induce a concerted transition to the activated state. The apparent existence of distinct phosphorylated forms of p53 tetramers with differing DNA binding activities is likely to reflect a difference in the degree of phosphorylation of such complexes. PKC-induced activation of DNA binding and loss of PAb421 reactivity are reversible upon subsequent treatment with protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Remarkably, dephosphorylation of p53 is associated with a decrease in DNA binding, and the latent, PAb421-responsive form of p53 is restored (Fig. 4C, lanes 11-16). Thus, once activated, p53 does not remain activated unless it is phosphorylated. In contrast, incubation of untreated p53 with PP1 and PP2A has no significant effect on p53 binding to DNA (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 and 3), demonstrating that inhibition of DNA binding by dephosphorylation is specific to the PKC-activated form of p53. This is consistent with the absence of a significant increase in p53 immunoreactivity to PAb421 upon treatment with phosphatases (see Fig. 3) and the lack of a significant formation of PAb421-p53-DNA intermediates upon addition of PAb421 to untreated p53 (Fig. 4, C and D), which also indicate that the untreated purified p53 protein is not significantly phosphorylated at the PKC reactive site in Sf9 insect cells. We show in this report that protein kinase C, and the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, can modulate the negative autoregulatory function of the carboxyl terminus of p53 and, consequently, the sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53. Taken together, several observations point to serine 378 being the predominantly targeted residue in human p53 involved in such regulation. 1) Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrates that protein kinase C phosphorylates p53 and the p53-421 peptide at a serine(s). 2) Phosphorylation of p53 results in a direct, conformation independent, loss in PAb421 reactivity. 3) The p53-421 peptide competes effectively with p53 for phosphorylation by protein kinase C. 4) Peptide deletion and site-specific mutation analyses show that serine 378 is phosphorylated. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of p53 can be associated with the formation of multiple distinct p53 tetramer species that are either latent or active in DNA binding. These are: 1) activated PAb421-negative p53, 2) activated PAb421-reactive p53, 3) latent PAb421-reactive p53, which appear to reflect differences in the degree of phosphorylation of a p53 tetramer. Existence of a PKC-activated/PAb421-reactive form of p53 indicates that partial phosphorylation of a p53 tetramer can be sufficient to activate DNA binding. Phosphorylation of more than one p53 molecule per tetramer is, however, required for the concerted transition to an activated state. Such modulation of the sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53 represents an apparent novel mechanism for transcription factor activation by PKC. Such regulation of p53 is of particular interest in light of recent findings that loss of PAb421 reactivity of p53 occurs in vivo upon growth arrest of glioblastoma cells as a result of overexpression of p53(38Ullrich S.J. Mercer W.E. Appella E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1635-1643PubMed Google Scholar), in resting lymphocytes(39Milner J. Nature. 1984; 310: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and apoptotic cells, 3S. Velasco-Miguel and N. Kley, unpublished observations. implicating the PAb421-negative form of p53 as a possible active tumor suppressor form of p53. Phosphorylation of human p53 by casein kinase II does not generate a PAb421-negative form of p53 in vitro. 4F. Morin and N. Kley, unpublished observation. Similarly, mutation of serine 389 in murine p53 to aspartic acid does not change pAb421 reactivity(47Rolley N. Milner J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3067-3070PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, results presented here suggest that PKC and protein phosphatases PP1 or PP2A, or cellular enzymes with the specificity of these, may provide a mechanism to regulate the transition of p53 from a latent (PAb421-reactive) to active (PAb421-negative) (or vice versa) DNA binding transcription factor. The monoclonal antibody PAb421 could be used as a molecular probe to distinguish various forms of p53, monitor potential post-translational modification in vivo, and establish the functional significance of modification of the PKC-reactive site in the activation of cellular p53. Which type of protein kinase might be a functionally relevant regulator of p53 is not yet known, and identification of a presumed active kinase will constitute an area of considerable interest.

These functional units, which are about 1000 amino acids in length, are believed to be essential for amino acid activation and thioester formation. To delineate the minimal extension of such a domain, we have amplified and cloned truncated fragments of the grsA gene, encoding the 1098-amino acid multifunctional gramicidin S synthetase 1, GrsA. The overexpressed His6-tagged GrsA derivatives were affinity-purified, and the catalytic properties of the deletion mutants were examined by biochemical studies including ATPdependent amino acid activation, carboxyl thioester formation, and the ability to racemize the covalently bound phenylalanine from L- to the D-isomer. These studies revealed a core fragment (PheAT-His) that comprises the first 656 amino acid residues of GrsA, which restored all activities of the native protein, except racemization of phenylalanine. A further deletion of about 100 amino acids at the C-terminal end of the GrsA core fragment (PheAT-His), including the putative thioester binding motif LGGHSL, produced a 556-amino acid fragment (PheA-His) that shows a phenylalanine-dependent aminoacyl adenylation, but almost no thioester formation.

Recent biochemical and genetic studies suggested a model for the elongation reaction that assumes the involvement of multiple cofactors of the 4′-phosphopantetheine type. One cofactor for each amino acid activating domain was suggested, rather than the presence of a centrally located sole cofactor(5Schlumbohm W. Stein T. Ullrich C. Vater J. Krause M.

These cofactors may facilitate the ordered shift of the carboxyl thioester-activated amino acids between the domains that assemble the multienzyme, resulting in the formation of a peptide chain with a defined sequence(7Turgay K.

Protein chemical studies have identified proteolytic fragments with molecular masses of about 110-120 kDa able to activate an individual amino acid(10Krause M. Marahiel M.A. von Döhren H.

These fragments seemed to correspond with the characterized activating spots, defined by Lipmann (18Lipmann F. Gevers W. Kleinkauf H. Roskoski R. Adv. Enzymol. 1971; 35: 1-33PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, sequence comparisons revealed for a diverse number of multifunctional peptide synthetases the presence of homologous domains of about 600 amino acids in length(2Marahiel M.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Turgay K. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These regions contain six highly conserved motifs, designated core sequences (see Fig. 1b), which are typical for a superfamily of adenylate- and thioester-forming enzymes(7Turgay K. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Previous studies, including site-directed mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling with ATP analogous, have shown the involvement of the core sequences 2-5 in ATP binding and hydrolysis(19Tokita K. Hori K. Kurotsu T. Kanda M. Saito Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Gocht M. Marahiel M.A. J.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6276-6283Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). They also suggested the association of core 6 in covalent binding of the substrate amino acid(5Schlumbohm W. Stein T. Ullrich C. Vater J. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Kruft V. Wittmann-Liebold B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23135-23141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gocht M. Marahiel M.A. J.

These results hint that only a conserved domain, rather than a complete peptide synthetase, performed the specific activation of a cognate amino acid. However, although core motifs were suggested to be essential for this activity, it was never shown biochemically that only the conserved domain could activate an individual amino acid. Based on sequence alignments and a limited number of biochemical studies, two types of domains have been characterized within bacterial and fungal peptide synthetases. Type I comprises about 1100 amino acids and bears the functions of amino acid activation and thioester formation(1Zuber P. Nakano M.M. Marahiel M.A. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1993: 897-916Google Scholar, 2Marahiel M.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), whereas type II carries in addition an insertion of about 430 amino acids, which may function as a N-methyltransferase module(12Haese A. Schubert M. Herrmann M. Zocher R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Weber G. Schörgendorfer K. Schneider-Scherzer E. Leitner E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The latter type of domain was only found in fungal peptide synthetases involved in the synthesis of the cyclic peptides enniatin and cyclosporin. Both synthetases catalyze the incorporation of N-methylated amino acids. Furthermore, the sequence analysis revealed a conserved region located to the C-terminal end of type I domains that activate D-configurated amino acids. Therefore, this region was designated as a putative racemization module(8Fuma S. Fujishima Y. Corbell N. D'Souza C. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Yamane K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In order to understand the structure/function relationship of peptide synthetases and to determine the arrangement of putative modules facilitating substrate adenylation, thioester formation and racemization, we used GrsA as a model enzyme. The grsA gene encodes the 1098-amino acid residue gramicidin S synthetase 1 (GrsA), which catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of the cyclic decapeptide gramicidin S(4Lipmann F. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1980; 21: 227-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Krätzschmar J. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5422-5429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It activates L-phenylalanine and racemizes it to the D-isomer. Therefore, GrsA represents a model for a type I domain that contains all integrated functions within a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of 126.7 kDa. We define in this work, by deletion studies, the minimal size of an amino acid activating domain and determine the locations of integrated modules involved in ATP-dependent acyladenylation, thioester formation, and epimerization. We used the pQE60 His6 tag fusion vector, purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), for cloning of the truncated grsA fragments. pQE60 is a derivative of pDS described by Bujard et al.(25Bujard H. Gentz R. Lanzer M. Stüber D. Müller M. Ibrahim I. Häuple M.T. Dobberstein B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 416-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and contains information required for replication as described for pACYC184 (26Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the T5 promotor, a ribosome binding site, a His6 tag, a small multiple cloning site, and a transcriptional terminator(27Hochuli E. Bannwarth W. Döbeli H. Gentz R. Stüber D. Bio/Technology. 1988; 11: 1321-1325Google Scholar). The vector allowed the expression of the genes from the authentic ATG codon, but required the modification of the sequences around that codon to form a NcoI restriction site. It was also necessary to create a BamHI site at the 3′ end, because the inserts had to be ligated in-frame with the His6 tag included in the vector. To fit these requirements, the insert sequences could be modified using 5′-modified PCR primers to generate the terminal restriction sites needed. The sequences of the oligonucleotides, which were synthesized by Dr. Michael Krause (Mikrochemische Einheit, FB20, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany), were as follows (underlined, modified sequences; bold, restriction sites): oligo 5′-Phe-NcoI: 5′-ATA TCC ATG GTA AAC AGT TCT AAA AG-3′; oligo 3′-PheA-BamHI: 5′-TCT CGG ATC CTA ATA CAT CCT GCC AG-3′; oligo 3′-PheAT-BamHI: 5′-ATC GGA TCC ATT TGG TCT ATA CAA C-3′; and oligo 3′-PheATS-BamHI: 5′-ATA GGA TCC TAA TTC AAT AGA CCA GTC C-3′. The amplification of the grsA fragments was performed using Deep VentR® DNA polymerase, 10 × reaction buffer from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany), and different pairs of primers. The reaction conditions were: 0.2-20 ng of chromosomal DNA from Bacillus brevis ATCC 9999, 1-10 pmol of primers (equimolar), 300 μM deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 10 mM potassium chloride, 10 mM ammonium sulfate, 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.8 at 25°C), 6 mM magnesium sulfate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 unit of Deep VentR® DNA polymerase in a total volume of 100 μl(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick-spin PCR purification kit as described by the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Standard procedures were used for the digestion with restriction enzymes, the cloning of the DNA fragments, and the preparation of the transformed plasmid DNA(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We also inspected both the ATG and the His6 tag fusion sites between vector and truncated grsA fragments by sequencing using the chain termination method of Sanger et al.(29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52063) Google Scholar). The sequences of the primers used, which were also synthesized by Dr. M. Krause, were as follows: oligo 5′-promotor: 5′-GGC GTA TCA CGA GGC CC-3′; 3′-His tag: 5′-ACG CCC GGC GGC AAC CG-3′. Modified expression plasmids containing the amplified grsA fragments were transformed in Escherichia coli M15(pREP4)(30Zamenhof P.J. Villarejo M. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 107: 171-178Crossref Google Scholar). The transformants were used to inoculate 2 × YT medium (31Brown T.A. Molecular Biology, Labfax. BIOS Scientific Publishers Ltd., Manchester, United Kingdom1991Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (25 μg/ml), and magnesium chloride (10 mM). Cells were grown at 30°C with moderate shaking until A600 nm reached 1.5-1.8. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mM, and cultures were grown for an additional 3 h. The extent of expression was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using the method of Laemmli(32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204747) Google Scholar). All operations were carried out at 4°C except the chromatography, which was performed at room temperature. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 6,000 × g, and resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 at 23°C, 300 mM sodium chloride) at 3 volumes/g of wet weight. Subsequently, the samples were lysed by freezing, thawing, and sonication using a Branson Sonifier at middle output. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant obtained was directly applied to a Ni2+-charged chelating Superose HR 10/2 column, previously equilibrated with sonication buffer. Both the immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography column and the fast performance liquid chromatography system were purchased from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc. (Freiburg, Germany). The proteins were eluted by applying imidazole gradients ranging over 0-250 mM in sonication buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%), pooled, dialyzed against assay buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.8 at 4°C, 10 mM magnesium chloride, 2 mM dithioerythritol, and 1 mM EDTA), and measured using the procedure of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (209612) Google Scholar). Essentially, ATP-PPi exchange of the GrsA derivatives was measured as described by Lee and Lipmann(34Lee S.G. Lipmann F. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The label, tetrasodium [32P]pyrophophate (16.06 Ci/mmol), was purchased from DuPont NEN (Bad Homburg, Germany). An assay mix contained 20 pmol of enzyme, 0.02-0.2 mM ATP, 0.02-0.2 mMD-Phe, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 at 23°C, 1 mM dithioerythritol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 0.15 μCi of [32P]pyrophosphate in a total volume of 100 μl. Determination of the substrate specificity was performed under saturating conditions with 0.2 mM of the cognate and non-cognate amino acids, respectively. Covalent binding of the substrate amino acid phenylalanine was tested as described previously by Gocht et al.(20Gocht M. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L-[U-14C]Phe (474 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham/Buchler (Braunschweig, Germany). Each assay mix contained 0.1 nmol of enzyme, 0 or 2 mM ATP, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 at 23°C, 1 mM dithioerythritol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM magnesium chloride, and 2 μCi of [14C]Phe in a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37°C. They were stopped by addition of 2 ml of ice-cold 7% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and further incubated on ice for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were collected on glass fiber filters (GF-92; Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), and washed with an excess of trichloroacetic acid. After addition of 5 ml of scintillation mixture (Rotiszint Eco Plus; Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) retarded enzyme-bound [14C]Phe was counted in a 1900CA Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard). The cleavage of the enzyme-phenylalanine complexes was done as described by Ullrich et al.(35Ullrich C. Kluge B. Palacz Z. Vater J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6503-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated complexes were washed five times with trichloroacetic acid and two times with ethanol to remove any traces of unbound label. The vacuum-dried pellets were suspended in 100 μl of cleavage solution (80% formic acid and 6% hydrogen peroxide) and incubated at 56°C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were dried again, extracted with 50% ethanol several times, and subjected to thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for analysis. Analysis of protein-[14C]Phe cleavage products was done by chiral plate high performance thin-layer chromatography (2.5 cm × 10-cm chiral high performance thin layer chromatography plates; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with solvent system A (methanol-water-acetonitrile; 1:1:4)(23D'Souza C. Nakano M.M. Corbell N. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3502-3510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The label was identified by autoradiography and by scanning on a Berthold LB2723 thin-layer scanner II. To delineate the minimal extension of an amino acid activating domain, we have amplified truncated fragments of the grsA gene. As shown in Fig. 1, we chose the 3′ end oligonucleotides for the PCR in consideration of structural conservations found in peptide synthetases. The first fragment amplified comprises 2421 base pairs and encoded the 92.5-kDa mutant PheATS-His (Fig. 1c). It carries a deletion of 291 aa at the C-terminal end of the native peptide synthetase GrsA (1098 aa). This protein is devoid of a putative racemization module. The second amplified grsA fragment of 1968 base pairs encoded the 76.2-kDa deletion mutant PheAT-His. This construct, comprising 656 aa, reduced the primary structure of the intact GrsA protein to a conserved region, typical for adenylate- and thioester-forming enzymes. Also constructed was a third GrsA deletion. Here an additional 100 aa from the C-terminal end of PheAT-His was removed, resulting in the 556-aa (64.3-kDa) fragment PheA-His. This GrsA mutant is devoid of a putative thioester binding site and possesses the primary structure of a superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes(7Turgay K. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fig. 1c summarizes the extent of the GrsA deletion mutants derived. Amplification of the grsA fragments encoding the multienzyme derivatives, was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DNA fragments obtained were purified and cloned as described. In addition, each mutant plasmid was confirmed by sequencing the junctions between vector and inserted grsA fragments. High level expression of the GrsA derivatives was obtained, using freshly transformed E. coli cells containing pREP4 and pQE60 derivatives. Optimization of the fermentation parameters of E. coli strain M15 with respect to the culture medium, the production time, and the concentration of IPTG revealed the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” A very important factor in the solubility of the expressed recombinant GrsA derivatives was the addition of magnesium chloride. We found that a concentration of 10 mM Mg2+ in the culture medium increased the yield of soluble protein from 10% to more than 75%, constituting magnesium as a cofactor of peptide synthetases during ATP hydrolysis. Using optimized conditions, we found high level expression with a predominant soluble cytoplasmic location of the GrsA derivatives (Fig. 2a). The purification of the expressed proteins was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using these optimized conditions, we obtained the recombinant proteins to near homogeneity. Fig. 2b shows the SDS-PAGE of the purified protein pools. The gel revealed molecular masses of 91, 70, and 62 kDa for the truncated GrsA deletion mutants PheATS-His, PheAT-His, and PheA-His, respectively. These data correspond to the values deduced from the DNA sequences. The protein pools were dialyzed against assay buffer, and protein concentration was determined. The first step of amino acid activation during non-ribosomal peptide biosynthesis is the ATP-dependent substrate activation as acyladenylate(36Vater J. Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Biochemistry of Peptide Antibiotics. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1990: 33-35Crossref Google Scholar). We determined the influence of the introduced C-terminal deletions in GrsA on Phe-dependent ATP-PPi exchange. As shown in Table 1, only slight alteration in exchange activities were observed for the GrsA deletions, when compared with the native GrsA protein. The deletion of a putative racemase module in mutant PheATS-His induced the activity to nearly 120% of the wild type level for L-Phe-dependent ATP-PPi exchange. The deletions in GrsA derivatives PheAT-His and PheA-His caused no reduction in exchange activities and revealed normal levels for the L-Phe-dependent reaction. Interestingly, even the 556-aa construct PheA-His, possessing nearly half the size of GrsA (1098 aa), restored the same adenylation activity as the wild type protein (Table 1). The substrate specificity of GrsA deletions was investigated with respect of the cognate amino acid phenylalanine, as well as of the non-cognate amino acids that comprise the peptide antibiotic gramicidin S and the Phe analogue 3-phenylpropionic acid. These studies were performed using saturating concentrations for all amino acids tested. As shown in Fig. 3, the amino acid-dependent activation revealed for all deletion mutants high exchange activities for D- and L-phenylalanine and almost no activation in the case of the Phe-carboxyl acid analogue 3-phenylpropionic acid, proline, valine, ornithine, and leucine. The highest nonspecific exchange activities obtained for the non-cognate hydrophobic amino acids L-Val and L-Leu were achieved for the mutant PheAT-His. This construct also revealed a slight reduction in D-Phe-dependent exchange activity. The slightly reduced specificity of the GrsA mutant PheAT-His was significant, although the reason for remains unclear, because the smaller fragment, PheA-His, restored high specificity for the cognate amino acids D- and L-phenylalanine. Nevertheless, this is the first clear indication that the core activities involving amino acid recognition and the ATP-dependent activation are located within the first 556 aa residues of the multifunctional peptide synthetase GrsA. We investigated the binding affinities of the mutant GrsA proteins and the substrates ATP and phenylalanine, respectively. The kinetic constants (Kmapparent) were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots in dependence on the concentration of both reaction partners (37Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975: 273-283Google Scholar) (data not shown). Plots obtained at different substrate concentrations intersect at abscissa values of −1/Kmapparent. The kinetic constants determined for wild type GrsA and mutants are summarized in Table 1. All deletion mutants bind the substrates ATP and phenylalanine with nearly the same affinity as the wild type protein. The Kmapparent values obtained also correspond to those determined previously for the four GrsB domains and TycA(20Gocht M. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kittelberger R. Altmann M. von Döhren H. Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Peptide Antibiotics, Biosynthesis and Functions. Walt"

https://openalex.org/W2041939573,"More than 70% of the RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase during run-off transcription in vitro can be incorrect products, up to twice as long as the expected transcripts. Transcriptions with model templates indicate that false transcription is mainly observed when the correct product cannot form stable secondary structures at the 3′-end. Therefore, the following hypothesis is tested: after leaving the DNA template, the polymerase can bind a transcript to the template site and the 3′-end of the transcript to the product site and extend it, if the 3′-end is not part of a stable secondary structure. Indeed, incubation of purified transcripts with the polymerase in transcription conditions triggers a 3′-end prolongation of the RNA. When two RNAs of different lengths are added to the transcription mix, both generate distinct and specific patterns of prolonged RNA products without any interference, demonstrating the self-coding nature of the prolongation process. Furthermore, sequencing of the high molecular weight transcripts demonstrates that their 5′-ends are precisely defined in sequence, whereas the 3′-ends contain size-variable extensions which show complementarity to the correct transcript. Surprisingly, a reduction of the UTP concentration to 0.2-1.0 mM in the presence of 3.5-4.0 mM of the other NTPs leads to faithful transcription and good yields, irrespective of the nucleotide composition of the template. More than 70% of the RNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase during run-off transcription in vitro can be incorrect products, up to twice as long as the expected transcripts. Transcriptions with model templates indicate that false transcription is mainly observed when the correct product cannot form stable secondary structures at the 3′-end. Therefore, the following hypothesis is tested: after leaving the DNA template, the polymerase can bind a transcript to the template site and the 3′-end of the transcript to the product site and extend it, if the 3′-end is not part of a stable secondary structure. Indeed, incubation of purified transcripts with the polymerase in transcription conditions triggers a 3′-end prolongation of the RNA. When two RNAs of different lengths are added to the transcription mix, both generate distinct and specific patterns of prolonged RNA products without any interference, demonstrating the self-coding nature of the prolongation process. Furthermore, sequencing of the high molecular weight transcripts demonstrates that their 5′-ends are precisely defined in sequence, whereas the 3′-ends contain size-variable extensions which show complementarity to the correct transcript. Surprisingly, a reduction of the UTP concentration to 0.2-1.0 mM in the presence of 3.5-4.0 mM of the other NTPs leads to faithful transcription and good yields, irrespective of the nucleotide composition of the template. Run-off transcription in vitro using bacteriophage RNA polymerases (Chamberlin and Ryan, 1982) was developed during the last decade as an efficient method for the synthesis of biologically active RNA (Melton et al., 1984; Krieg and Melton, 1984). Among the known variants of this technique the systems based on T7 RNA polymerase are the most widely used. This enzyme can be isolated in large amounts from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain (Davanloo et al., 1984), and a number of suitable plasmid vectors containing the strong class III T7 promoters (Dunn and Studier, 1983) or synthetic DNA (Milligan et al., 1987) can be used as templates. The transition from small scale transcription assays as described in the early reports (Chamberlin et al., 1970; Chamberlin and Ring, 1973) to large scale synthesis of RNA requires an increase in the input of nucleoside triphosphates to the millimolar level (Milligan and Uhlenbeck, 1989; Weitzmann et al., 1990). The optimal concentration of nucleotides can depend on the particular template in use (Milligan and Uhlenbeck, 1989), and it has been shown that an excess of nucleotides (more than 4 mM each) can inhibit the polymerization (Draper et al., 1988). In general, an upper value of 2-4 mM for all four NTPs combined with a magnesium concentration of 14-22 mM gives satisfactory yields. The fidelity of the in vitro transcription process is usually sufficient for low scale synthesis. However, non-coded 3′ prolongation of run-off transcripts has been reported as one or two extra nucleotides in the case of synthetic DNA templates (Milligan et al., 1987), or as very long RNA chains in the case of linearized plasmid templates with 3′ overhanging ends (“snap back” effect; Schenborn and Mierendorf, 1985, Weitzmann et al., 1993). Using in vitro run-off transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, we found that more than 70% of the products could be aberrant transcripts which were longer than the coded RNA (>15 additional nucleotides). We analyzed the reasons for this dramatic mis-synthesis and observed that the processivity of the T7 RNA polymerase is specifically very sensitive to the UTP concentration. Under conditions where the initial concentrations of all four NTPs were the same, a new phenomenon was revealed: after a faithful run-off transcription, the T7 RNA polymerase can accept a former transcript as second template and extend this RNA at the 3′-end in a self-coded fashion, if the 3′-end is not folded into a stable secondary structure. Reduction exclusively of the UTP concentration enables an efficient synthesis of correct products but effectively prevents that of false products. Deoxynucleoside triphosphates as well as all the restriction enzymes (except SspI), calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, poly(U)- and oligo(dT)-cellulose were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. SspI and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs and mung bean nuclease from U. S. Biochemicals. The ribonucleoside triphosphates and the inorganic pyrophosphatase were from Sigma. Plasmid pSP65 and RNasin (40 units/μl) were obtained from Promega Biotec, [32P]UTP, [32P]CTP, [32P]ATP, and [32P]GTP from Amersham. The oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer and purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Hypersil ODS 5-C18 column. Chemical synthesis of RNA was performed on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite chemistry (Scaringe et al., 1990). The plasmid pTZDec-m, a derivative form pTZ18R (Pharmacia) coding for the decacodon O-mRNA (see Table 1), was a kind gift from Drs. H.-J. Rheinberger and B. Lewicki, MPI Berlin. The T7 RNA polymerase was isolated from the E. coli strain BL21 containing the plasmid pAR1219, according to published procedures (Davanloo et al., 1984).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized containing the sequence to be cloned (50-60 nucleotides, see corresponding RNA sequences in Table 1). A short complementary oligo(DNA) served as a primer for double-stranded DNA synthesis (Cobianchi and Wilson, 1987). The sequence corresponding to the O-mRNA (Table 1) was deleted by successive digestions of pTZDec-m plasmid with EcoRI, mung bean nuclease, and HpaI, respectively; and the 5′-phosphorylated double-stranded sDNAs were inserted into the pTZDec-m plasmid by blunt-end ligation. The sequence of a tRNAPhe gene from E. coli together with a T7 promoter sequence was cloned at the SmaI site of the plasmid pSP65. The double-stranded sDNA insert was obtained in the following way. Two oligo(DNA)s were synthesized, the first contained the sequence of the T7 promoter and the sequence corresponding to that of tRNAPhe from nucleotide 1 to 40, the second contained the sequence complementary to that of tRNAPhe from position 22 to 76 (18 nucleotides are complementary to the first oligo) plus a BstNI site for linearization. The recombinant plasmids were used for transformations of E. coli DH5 according to standard procedures. The positive clones were sequenced in both directions in the region of the insert. Large scale preparation of plasmid was done by means of a protocol combining alkaline lysis (Birnboim, 1983) and polyethylene glycol precipitation (Lis, 1980), followed by anion-exchange chromatography purification on QIAGEN columns. This combination of methods yields about the same amount and quality of plasmid DNA as the standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989) and has the advantage of not requiring the use of RNase A during the preparation, thus avoiding the risk of contamination of the transcription templates. The run-off transcription templates were then prepared by incubation of the purified plasmids with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The assays were performed using a set of conditions optimized according to previous reports (Milligan and Uhlenbeck, 1989; Weitzmann et al., 1990). The standard analytical assays were performed in 25 μl of a transcription mix containing 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (37°C), 22 mM MgCl2, 1 mM spermidine, 5 mM dithioerythitol, 100 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin (RNase and DNase free), 1 unit/μl ribonuclease inhibitor (RNasin), 5 units/ml of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 0.5 pmol (∼1 μg) of linearized plasmid DNA template (or 1 pmol of synthetic DNA templates), 3.75 mM (or the indicated values) each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, and 40 μg/ml (or the indicated amount) of purified T7 RNA polymerase. The components were mixed at room temperature and incubated at 37°C for the times indicated (3 h standard). The transcription products were analyzed by cold trichloroacetic acid precipitation in order to estimate the extent of reaction (when a 32P label was included), and by electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gels to determine the quality of the RNA synthesized. The electrophoretical patterns were visualized by autoradiography and/or via staining with ethidium bromide or toluidine blue. The synthetic DNA templates were assembled by annealing a 17-mer oligodeoxynucleotide with the sequence of the region −17 to −1 of the consensus class III T7 promoter to a template DNA strand containing complementary sequence of the promoter followed by that of the RNA to be synthesized. In assays where purified RNA was used as sole template, it was added in amounts ranging from 0.25 to 20-fold molar excess over polymerase. The transcription products of the plasmids pTZDec-m, pTDMS, and pTDLS (linearized with BamHI) were purified after phenol-chloroform extraction of the transcription mix by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Sambrook et al., 1989) followed by ion-exchange chromatography on QIAGEN columns. Transcripts obtained from the pTMF template (linearized with SspI) or synthetic DNA templates were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The run-off transcript of the plasmid pTZDec-m was sequenced with the chain termination method (Hahn et al., 1989) using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (from Pharmacia-PL Biochemicals) and a synthetic DNA primer. The transcripts derived from the pTMF template were directly labeled at the 5′-end by including [γ32P]GTP in the in vitro transcription reaction. The sequences were determined with the enzymatic sequencing method using the RNA Sequencing Kit from Pharmacia-PL Biochemicals. The sequencing of the 27-mer product obtained from transcription of MF-mRNA was performed using the phosphorothioate method of Gish and Eckstein(1988) with slight modifications as described in Schatz et al.(1991). Five transcription reactions were performed in parallel, in four of which 20% of one nucleotide was replaced by the corresponding [αS]NTP. The fifth reaction was lacking [αS]NTPs, and the corresponding product was used as control for detecting spontaneous chain disruptions. The transcription reactions were performed under standard conditions (see above) in a total volume of 50 μl containing 200 pmol of MF-mRNA as template and 20 pmol of T7 polymerase. The transcription products were separated on a polyacrylamide gel, the bands visualized by UV shadowing, and the transcripts corresponding to the “27-mer” band were extracted. After 5′-labeling, 10 μl (∼200,000 disintegrations/min) were treated with 1 μl of a 10 mM J2 solution in ethanol, incubated for 1 min at room temperature, precipitated with ethanol, and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The secondary structure of minimum free energy for the synthetic RNA molecules was determined with the program FOLD (Zuker and Stiegler, 1981) using the energy parameters defined by Turner and co-workers (Freier et al., 1986), and/or the program MFOLD (Zuker, M., 1989). The startling observation was derived from analytical in vitro transcription assays performed with templates designed for the synthesis of small model mRNAs devoid of strong secondary structure (see Table 1). Under standard conditions (all NTPs at 3.75 mM), the products obtained with the plasmid templates revealed a surprising phenomenon. In the cases of pTZDec-m, pTDMS and pTDLS (decacodon template series) the calculated transcription efficiency (RNA copies synthesized per template) suggested more than quantitative utilization of the ATP added to the assay, if one assumes exclusive synthesis of the expected transcript; the calculated ATP consumption was 12-15% higher than the total input of non-labeled ATP (the label was incorporated as an [32P]NTP different from ATP in these cases). The gel analysis of these transcripts showed a second anomaly which might be the reason for the mis-estimate. The RNA synthesized ran in the sequencing gel as a smear starting at the position of the full-length transcript and going to higher molecular weights (Fig. 1A, lanes 4-6). The track corresponding to the MF-mRNA transcript (Fig. 1A, lane 7) also showed a smear ranging from the expected 46-mer to the region corresponding to about 75 nucleotides. The RNA obtained from the synthetic DNA templates similarly showed a non-homogeneous electrophoretic pattern (Fig. 1C, lane 2). It is clear that the assumption of exact transcription was not justified. Since the nucleotide composition of the longer transcripts is not known, the transcription efficiency calculation based on one radioactive nucleotide is not reliable. In contrast, the unmodified tRNAPhe transcript consisted of a single product of the right size (Fig. 1C, lane 4). At first glance it appeared that the partial homopolymeric nature of the model mRNAs could be the cause of the aberrant transcription as indicated in previous reports of “slippage” of T7 RNA polymerase on poly(A) tracks (Milligan and Uhlenbeck, 1989). However, a second series of templates with balanced base composition and lacking homopolymeric tracks gave similar results (data not shown). Kinetics of the MF-mRNA synthesis were performed by subjecting the samples withdrawn from the transcription assay at various times to gel electrophoresis and analyzing the resulting autoradiogram by densitometry (Fig. 1B). At the onset of incubation predominantly correct products were synthesized, as evidenced by the main band product with the expected 46 nucleotides. However, the longer the incubation for transcription lasts the more false, overlong products are produced, reaching a comparable level with the expected product after 180 min of incubation (Fig. 1B). The apparent lag period between the incubation start and the efficient synthesis of high molecular weight products indicates that the synthesis of longer RNA is a secondary process which needs an induction time. This induction time appears to be inversely related to the speed of RNA synthesis (i.e. with more enzyme the lag period is smaller, data not shown) and seems to be different for every template. These observations suggest that a minimal concentration of transcripts is required for the onset of aberrant transcription. The observation that some templates reproducibly yielded exact products whereas others provided large amounts of overlong products was a surprise. A possible reason could be seen in the fact that the transcripts systematically differed in their capability to form secondary structure at the 3′-end region. For example, unmodified tRNAPhe is obviously able to form the known secondary structures of the wild type tRNA since the transcript was functional in aminoacylation assays and in poly(Phe) synthesis with poly(U) programmed 70 S ribosomes from E. coli (data not shown). It follows that the 3′-end of the tRNAPhe transcript should have only four nucleotides which are not involved in secondary structure. In contrast, the other transcripts listed in Table 1(except the short form of the decacodon LS-mRNA) show a low overall tendency to form double helices and their 3′-end regions are not involved in stable secondary structures (as predicted with the programs FOLD and MFOLD; data not shown). The template for the decacodon LS-mRNA offered a convenient system to test the importance of secondary structure at the 3′-end of the correct transcript with regard to the quality of transcription. Upon restriction with BamHI, this plasmid serves as a template for the synthesis of the long form of the decacodon LS-mRNA, which contains a poly(A) tail of 59 adenyl residues and is thus free of secondary structure at the 3′-end (Fig. 2A). When restricted with BglII the plasmid codes a short form of the mRNA which lacks the poly(A) tail and carries a secondary structure motif at the 3′-end (Fig. 2B). The results of parallel transcription assays with both forms of the template were striking: products with 3′-end secondary structure show one main product corresponding to the expected length practically free of longer transcripts (Fig. 2B), whereas large amounts (∼60% of the toluidine blue-stainable material) of prolonged false transcripts were found with the RNA containing the poly(A) tail (Fig. 2A). One possible explanation for the appearance of high molecular weight products is that after running off the T7 RNA polymerase can rebind the previously synthesized RNA and continue the RNA synthesis thus making longer transcripts. A prerequisite for an RNA to function in that way is a loose 3′-end free of secondary structure. It is not yet clear at this point whether one RNA molecule can serve as template for the prolongation of another RNA molecule or the template RNA is prolonged at its own 3′-end (self-coding; Fig. 3C). The possibility of using RNA as template for the DNA dependent T7 RNA polymerase has in fact already been described by Chamberlin and Ring(1973) and Kornaska and Sharp (1989), among others. We confirmed that poly(U) could indeed be used as template, yielding a rate of polymerization of 0.3-0.5 nucleotides/s and enzyme (at saturation; data not shown), which is about 100-fold slower than in the presence of a DNA template under the conditions used. Furthermore, the fact that for detectable transcription the concentration of RNA template must be approximately 20 times higher than that of DNA templates indicates a higher affinity of the enzyme for DNA templates. When a small RNA practically lacking predictable secondary structure was used as template (MF-mRNA, for sequence see Table 1) the polymerization was also efficient (up to 1600 nt ( 1The abbreviations used are: ntnucleotide(s)cpmcounts/min. )polymerized/μg of T7 RNA polymerase in standard conditions, data not shown). The products of a transcription incubation including [32P]UTP as label were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The corresponding autoradiogram (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-3) showed no products with the length of the starting template (46 nt) but rather a group of short aberrant products 5-26 nucleotides long (about 20% of the synthesized RNA); a strong band corresponding to a 27-28-mer (∼40% of the total RNA) is also present, suggesting that the RNA is mainly used as template at about the middle of the sequence, and relatively large amounts of long transcripts (∼40%) also appear which are longer than the starting template. Similar results with respect to nucleotide incorporation and size distribution of the transcripts were obtained using chemically synthesized RNAs having totally unrelated sequences but preserving the size and the lack of predictable secondary structure as common features (data not shown). nucleotide(s) counts/min. In order to determine the sequence of the strong band with about 27 nt, the transcription was repeated, but now allowing for random incorporation of a few phosphorothioated nucleotides at either A, G, C, or U positions. The oligonucleotides corresponding to the 27-mer were isolated, labeled at their 3′-ends with 32P, and then cleaved with iodine at the phosphorothioated positions and separated on a sequence gel (Gish and Eckstein, 1988). Fig. 4 demonstrates that the oligonucleotides were complementary to the 5′-end of the MF-mRNA. The prolongation of the transcripts exceeded the 23 nt identified on the sequence gel, since the last one (3′-C, see Fig. 4) and the first 2-3 nucleotides (AAG-5′) could not be detected for technical reasons. For convenience we call the respective band the “27-nt” product. The fact that a clean sequence pattern is obtained indicates that the 27 nt band contains one defined transcript. It is therefore clear that the 27-nt oligomer is the product of a defined de novo synthesis starting at a position which is about 19 nucleotides from the 3′-end of the template MF-mRNA. The fact that the addition of the non-labeled MF-mRNA yields two more or less defined product families (Fig. 3A), one shorter (about 27 nt) and one longer (50-80 nt) than the added MF-mRNA with 46 nt, could be explained as follows. The MF-mRNA binds around its 27th nucleotide to the template site of the T7 RNA polymerase. Then either de novo synthesis (Fig. 3C, left) occurs yielding the 27-nt long products; in other cases the polymerase prolongs added MF-mRNAs for about 27 nucleotides yielding the 75-nt products. It is possible that a template mRNA serves to prolong its own 3′-end at the later process. In the next experiment we wanted to analyze the fate of the input MF-mRNA, which therefore carries a 32P label at the 5′-end. The transcription was performed with non-labeled NTPs (Fig. 3A, lanes 5-9). The radioactivity was distributed between the original mRNA band (see lane 5) and a smear of overlong products of up to 80 nt comprising about 60% of the original input (determined by densitometry of the autoradiogram and by direct counting of gel slices) and showing a pattern of the main products (Fig. 3A, lane 6) very similar to that observed when a pTMF DNA template is used. These results again indicate that the T7 RNA polymerase uses the RNA as transcription template and is also able to prolong this RNA at the 3′-end. Interestingly, the input of RNA template, which varied from 10- to 0.5-fold molar excess over polymerase, had practically no effect on the pattern of 3′-end prolonged products (Fig. 3A, lanes 6-9). The fact that the same pattern is seen even at the lowest input of MF-mRNA is in favor of the view that the prolongation process is a self-coding mechanism (Fig. 3C, right). A rigorous test of this view is made in the next experiment. [32P]MF-mRNA (46 nt) is mixed with various amounts of non-labeled decacodon O-mRNA (143 nt). Both mRNAs can trigger different patterns of overlong products in a transcription assay. A self-coding mechanism (Fig. 3C, right) will show in the mixture experiment the two distinct patterns without any interference, whereas the possibility that “one RNA molecule serves as template for the prolongation of a second RNA molecule” (intermolecular mechanism; Fig. 3C, center) implies a significant change in the pattern of radioactive prolonged RNAs. Fig. 3B, lanes 1-4, shows that increasing amounts of decacodon O-mRNA do not at all interfere or disturb the distribution of the overlong products derived from MF-mRNA. Ethidium bromide staining of a second sequencing gel reveals that the decacodon O-mRNA also triggered its distinct pattern of prolonged RNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 7-10) independently of the presence of MF-mRNA. It follows that the 3′-end prolongation is most probably an intramolecularly coded, i.e. a self-coded process. According to the conclusions of the preceding section the extended transcripts must all have a defined 5′-end but various 3′ extensions, which should be complementary to the RNA template. This expectation was checked by sequencing the transcripts produced in a preparative assay (3.75 mM NTPs were used in these cases) and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DNA template for the MF-mRNA was selected for this purpose. After transcription under standard conditions, using [32P]GTP as label and pTMF (SspI restricted) as template, the full-length transcript and one sample from the area containing products with a higher molecular weight were isolated after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5A) and sequenced using enzymatic techniques. The sequencing patterns (Fig. 5, B and C) confirmed the expected sequence of the full-length transcript and revealed that the secondary bands (in a range of 50-70 nucleotides) contain a 5′-end with a sequence identical to the correct transcript (Fig. 5B) and 3′ prolongations with apparent complementarity to the correct transcript (Fig. 5, C and D). It follows that the aberrant transcripts are not the result of false transcription initiation or errors in the elongation process but rather of an extended synthesis (Fig. 5D). Sequencing of the heterogeneous transcripts from the template for the O-mRNA (Table 1 and Fig. 1A, lane 4) also revealed defined 5′-ends expected for the correct transcript (data not shown). We have identified three parameters which influence the extent of false transcription. One parameter already mentioned is the time of transcription incubation. At the beginning predominantly correct products are produced, whereas false transcripts accumulate at the end of long incubations (Fig. 1B). A second parameter is the concentration of T7 RNA polymerase. With the template for the decacodon LS-mRNA used in the experiment shown in Fig. 6, one should perform the reaction with an enzyme concentration of less than 10 μg/ml to avoid most of the smear of higher molecular weight products. However, adjusting the enzyme concentration for every individual template in order to achieve precise transcription is not always advisable, since for a number of templates the enzyme concentration had to be reduced below 4 μg/ml, which is too low for preparative purposes. The third parameter was a surprise. A strong and specific effect of the UTP concentration on the accuracy of transcription was found. Fig. 7A shows the transcription of the MF-mRNA (46 nucleotides) under conditions where the concentration of the nucleotides was systematically changed (one by one) in a range covering preparative and analytical conditions (3.75 mM to 188 μM). The autoradiogram reveals that a reduction of ATP or GTP lowers the efficiency of transcription with apparently no effect on the proportion of correct/incorrect products. The reduction of CTP seems to have no effect in the range of concentrations used, probably due to the fact that the transcript has only 1 cytosine. In sharp contrast, reduction of UTP predominantly reduces the synthesis of incorrect products. When we evaluated the gels quantitatively (Fig. 7B), the following results were obtained. At the lowest UTP concentration applied (188 μM) the most accurate transcription was observed and the correct transcripts amounted to about 80% of the total transcribed products, whereas the maximal amount of correct products (100%) was found at 0.7 mM UTP. Variation of the CTP concentration did not affect the accuracy of transcription; only 25% of the total transcripts were correct, whereas the yield of correct transcripts showed a shallow maximum at 0.7 mM CTP reaching 86% of the best yields found in the UTP series. Reduction of the ATP or GTP had a disastrous effect. The yield of correct transcripts went down to 3%, whereas the synthesis of incorrect transcripts increased to over 90%. Qualitatively, the same results were observed with various plasmid templates and synthetic DNA templates coding for transcripts with weak secondary structure at the 3′-end and with different nucleotide compositions For example, the oligo(DNA) containing the fragment of a tRNA gene corresponding to positions 1-40 of tRNAPhe plus the T7 promoter was transcribed. The transcription yielded mainly overlong products of about 60 nt. The prolongation complementary to the first 20 nucleotides of tRNAPhe contained only 3 U residues. Nevertheless, a reduction of the UTP concentration during transcription grossly prevented the synthesis of overlong transcripts (data not shown). It follows that the strong and specific effect observed with decreasing the UTP concentration is not related to the uridine content or nucleotide composition of the transcripts. The run-off in vitro transcription system with T7 RNA polymerase has been used for the synthesis of short (less than 100 nucleotides; Groebe and Uhlenbeck, 1988; Sampson and Uhlenbeck, 1988; Milligan and Uhlenbeck, 1989) and long RNAs (e.g. 16 S and 23 S rRNA; Nègre et al., 1989; Weitzmann et al., 1990). The transition from small scale to large scale assays required some changes of the transcription systems to improve the yield of synthetic RNA. Major changes are the inclusions of ribonuclease inhibitor and inorganic pyrophosphatase, which significantly improve the quality and the yield of products (Cunningham and Ofengand, 1990); minor improvements are the additions of polyethyleneglycol and Triton X-100 (Milligan and Uhlenbeck, 1987). Furthermore, the concentrations of nucleotides have to be increased, and it is normally assumed that an increase in the nucleotide concentration has no major effect on the quality of the RNA synthesized. However, it is frequently seen that the synthesis of full-length transcript is accompanied by production of higher and lower molecular weight products during large scale transcription assays using T7 and also other bacteriophage RNA polymerases (Milligan et al., 1987, Ling et al., 1989, Paddock, 1989). The transcription system previously optimized by us for the synthesis of a model mRNA coding for a decapeptide (see “Experimental Procedures”) was used to test the templates for different heteropolymeric mRNAs. The system works efficiently with respect to the incorporation of ribonucleotides in RNA, but the fidelity of the synthesis is far from optimal. In all cases presented in Fig. 1, the synthesis of the expected transcripts was accompanied by a significant production of RNA with higher molecular weights than expected, the only exception being the transcription with the tRNAPhe template. Since all the plasmid templates used in this experiment had 5′-protruding or blunt ends, the observed phenomenon is different from the snap back effect observed with DNA templates having 3′-protruding ends. This term describes the fact that an RNA polymerase engaged in transcription can, upon reaching the 5′-end of the template strand, turn to use the 3′-protruding end as a second template (a DNA to DNA jump) continuing the synthesis toward plasmid-sized transcripts (Schenborn and Mierendorf, 1985). Furthermore, the RNA extensions described in this paper were also produced with single-stranded DNA templates, which cannot trigger a snap back event. The template-independent addition of a few nucleotides at the 3′-end of small transcripts observed by Uhlenbeck and colleagues (Milligan et al., 1987) can also not explain the results, since the additions found in the cases reported here are much longer. Several observations reported in the literature as well as the results presented here led to a possible explanation for the aberrant transcription. First, it is known that the T7 RNA polymerase (as well as many other RNA polymerases) can accept RNA as template (Chamberlin and Ring, 1973; Kornaska and Sharp, 1989, 1990). Second, as shown in Fig. 1B, the production of high molecular weight RNA appears to be a late event during the transcription incubation. Third, in all cases where the phenomenon is visible the expected transcript has a 3′-end region which appears to be free from stable secondary structure (Fig. 2). Fourth, the presence of two different RNAs both with 3′-ends lacking stable secondary structures triggers a pattern of overlong products independently from each other. And finally, sequencing of the high molecular weight RNA revealed that it consists of a 5′ portion identical to the expected transcript plus a variable 3′ prolongation, which shows apparent complementarity with the transcript itself (Fig. 3D). It follows that the synthesis of aberrant transcripts is not related to abnormal transcription initiation. The problem starts when the “run-off” process is completed. The data suggest the following. During the run-off transcription and after the production of a certain amount of transcript, the RNA can serve as substrate for a self-coded 3′-end prolongation. A certain amount of transcript is required because the RNA has to compete with the DNA for the template site, which has a higher affinity for DNA. This explains the lag of appearance of false transcripts in the kinetics shown in Fig. 1B. In order to be fully efficient in this process, the RNA must have a 3′-end free of secondary structures. This means that at sufficient concentrations of RNA the T7 RNA polymerase swap from a DNA to an RNA template. A stable secondary structure at the 3′-end of a transcript obviously prevents the binding to the product site and possibly also to the template site of the polymerase (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3C). Since a secondary structure involving the 3′-end will form only after the release of the respective transcript, the RNA has probably to be released before it can occupy the template site and with its 3′-end the product site of the T7 RNA polymerase. After the self-coding process, the overlong products have now 3′-ends which are self complementary, are therefore involved in stable secondary structures, and thus cannot serve as template again preventing a further prolongation. This explains why overlong products have a length of less than twice that of the correct transcript. Our observations concerning the importance of a secondary structure at the 3′-end of a transcript agree well to what is known about the requirements for termination. T7 RNA polymerase terminates efficiently in vitro at a G:C rich hairpin/U stretch structure (Dunn and Studier, 1983). The hairpin formation is important for disrupting DNA (template)-RNA (transcript) interactions as well as interactions between RNA and polymerase (Sousa et al., 1992, and references therein). Three parameters of the transcription assay were shown to affect the relative amount of aberrant transcription: the time of transcription incubation (Fig. 1B), the stoichiometry of T7 RNA polymerase used relative to the DNA template (Fig. 6), and the concentrations of nucleotides. Fig. 6 demonstrates that, when the amount of enzyme surpasses a critical level, the synthesis of “smeared” products with a high molecular weight is exacerbated. It follows that an adjustment of the enzyme amount could be sufficient for a synthesis with tolerable amounts of secondary products. However, the enzyme reduction is not a practical solution in general, since the enzyme concentration must be reduced to inefficient low levels for many templates. Since higher concentration of polymerase leads to enhanced synthesis resulting in high concentration of RNA in the transcription assay, a transcript-coded transcription is favored under these conditions. Thus, lowering the polymerase concentration improves the transcription quality not by influencing the mode of action of the polymerase, but rather by lowering the synthesis of a possible RNA template and therefore does not provide a real improvement. According to the results in Fig. 7, manipulation of the nucleotide concentrations dramatically affects the production of high molecular weight RNA. The reduction of purine nucleotides and CTP caused a decrease in the yield of transcripts without improving the fidelity of transcription. In contrast, when the UTP concentration was decreased, a strong reduction in the synthesis of high molecular weight RNA was observed without a severe effect on the yield of the expected transcript. The same phenomenon was observed with different templates coding for RNAs with unrelated sequences and nucleotide composition (with or without homopolymeric tracks) but all preserving the lack of secondary structure at the 3′-end. Since there is no clear correlation between the composition of the transcripts and the effects of UTP, the data suggest that at high concentrations the UTP is an allosteric effector of the T7 RNA polymerase inducing a conformation which facilitates the acceptance of RNA as a template. This hypothesis is still speculative but has some support from the following observations. In analytical assays using micromolar concentrations of all four nucleotides, it has been shown that a reduction of the pyrimidines, especially the UTP, triggers an increased production of abortive transcripts (Ling et al., 1989) indicating loose enzyme-RNA complexes, i.e. the processivity of the enzyme is reduced when the UTP concentration is lower than that of the other nucleotides. A reduced processivity at decreased UTP conditions would certainly counteract the tendency to self-coded transcript prolongation. It is not clear whether RNA-coded de novo synthesis or self-coded 3′-end extension events occur in vivo. However, the intracellular molar ratio of ATP/UTP in E. coli is similar to that which we found optimal for an accurate run-off transcription (the ATP concentration in vivo is about 3 mM, while that of UTP is about 0.8 mM; Neuhard and Nygaard, 1987), suggesting that these types of activities of the T7 RNA polymerase are not common events (or constitute part of well controlled processes) inside the living cell. In vitro, a reduction of the UTP concentration to 0.2-1.0 mM while keeping the other nucleotides in the range of 3.5-4 mM (here the base composition of the expected transcript should be taken into account) is generally applicable and improves the fidelity of transcription, as well as giving a high yield of correct RNA synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase.

To specifically assess the importance of this region with respect to LPS binding, we constructed a mutant sCD14 (sCD14Δ56-64) lacking amino acids 57-64. sCD14Δ56-64 was isolated from the serum-free conditioned medium of this cell line, and, in all assays, the purified protein failed to recognize LPS or enable LPS-dependent responses in cells. We also demonstrated that the region between amino acids 57 and 64 is required for binding of a neutralizing CD14 mAb, MEM-18. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assays were used to demonstrate that MEM-18 and LPS compete for the same binding site on CD14.

Adaptor proteins (AP), initially identified based upon their ability to promote the formation of coat structures from clathrin(23Pearse B.M.F. Robinson M.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 151-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), are a major component of coated pits. They consist of two ∼100-kDa polypeptides (adaptins) and two smaller polypeptides. Adaptor complex 1 (AP1) is restricted to the Golgi region, and AP2 is localized to plasma membrane coated pits; each has a distinct subunit composition(24Keen J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The specific binding of liganddependent as well as constitutively internalized receptors to AP may thus be essential for endocytosis of these receptors. One mechanism by which EGFR associates with cellular proteins involves binding of SH2 domains to sites of tyrosine autophosphorylation that are located in the regulatory carboxyl terminus(25Carpenter G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3283-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). However, adaptor proteins lack SH2 domains, so the mechanisms for their association with EGFR are likely to be different. In this study, we demonstrate that autophosphorylation of EGFR is required for binding adaptor complexes via a mechanism that is distinct from binding to phosphotyrosine residues. Once formed, EGFR•AP complex stability is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, adaptor complexes and individual α- and β-subunits of AP2 bind to the regulatory carboxyl terminus of EGFR expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-EGFR-CT). In vivo ligand- and temperature-dependent interaction of EGFR with AP2 requires the regulatory carboxyl terminus previously shown to be necessary for ligand-dependent endocytosis of EGFR(8Chen W.S.

Mutant F5 EGFR contains Phe substitutions for all five known tyrosine autophosphorylation sites, i.e. Tyr-992, Tyr-1068, Tyr-1086, Tyr-1148, and Tyr-1173. This mutant was constructed using F3 EGFR as template(8Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.-P. Walton G.W. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

Additional changes of Tyr to Phe at residues 992 and 1086 in F3 EGFR were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis(37Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 468-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides were used: residue 992, 5′-GTGGGATGAGGAATTCGTCGGCAT-3′; and residue 1086, 5′-GGCTGATTGTGAAAGCTTGGATTCTGCACAG-3′. All constructions were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing.

A431 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. The medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 18 h before experiments. Cells grown on 10-cm dishes were incubated for 1 h in ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, without or with 200 ng/ml EGF. Cultures were then placed in a 37°C water bath for 12 min and, at the end of the incubation, were placed back on ice. Dishes were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were solubilized in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 10 min at 4°C. EGFR was immunoprecipitated with 10 μg of Ab 13A9 immobilized on protein G-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4°C. Immunobeads were washed three times with IP buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. To dephosphorylate immobilized EGFR, immunobeads were washed twice with dephosphorylation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Beads were then resuspended in 0.2 ml of dephosphorylation buffer, and 50 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was added for 15 min at 37°C. Beads were then washed twice with IP buffer and processed for electrophoresis. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with one of the following: rabbit polyclonal Ab 4516-8 or mouse monoclonal Ab PY20, 100/2, or AC1-M11. Both 100/2 and AC1-M11 recognized α-adaptins with approximately the same efficiency. Immunoreactive bands were detected using peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulins and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. To reprobe the same filter with a different antibody, it was then stripped for 30 min at 50°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence of 2% SDS and 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. All experiments were performed using sensor chips CM5, research-grade (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 25°C. The BIAcore running buffer used was 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.005% P-20 (Pharmacia). To immobilize EGFR, the sensor chip was activated by injection of 70 μl of a 1:1 mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (Pharmacia); 100 μl of Ab 13A9 at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, was injected over the surface of the activated chip, and excess reactive groups were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine HCl, pH 8.5. Purified EGFR (50 μl) at 50-200 μg/ml was injected onto the covalently linked antibody. Enzymatically active EGFR was injected in 50 μl of preservation buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 130 mM NaCl); urea-denatured receptor was injected in 50 μl of BIAcore running buffer. To autophosphorylate immobilized EGFR, 25 μl of 1 mM ATP in BIAcore running buffer containing 5 mM MnCl2 was injected. To dephosphorylate EGFR, 25 μl of dephosphorylation buffer containing 250 units/ml calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was injected. Efficiency of both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of EGFR was estimated by injection of Ab PY20 in BIAcore running buffer at a concentration of 75 μg/ml. In some experiments, 10 mM Tyr(P) in BIAcore running buffer was used as a competitor. AP complexes were exchanged into BIAcore running buffer by gel filtration and were spun for 15 min in a microcentrifuge prior to use. AP complexes (35 μl) were injected at a concentration 0.3 mg/ml in BIAcore running buffer. Although the highly purified adaptor preparations used contained predominantly AP2(31Smythe E. Carter L.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the specific AP bound to EGFR on the biosensor surface was not identified. Residues 975-1186 of EGFR was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase. For isolation of proteins, 100 ml of overnight culture was inoculated into 1 liter of 2 × yeast tryptone medium and induced with isopropylthiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in buffer containing 0.2% lauroyl sarcosine. Glutathione-agarose was used to purify proteins from the lysates. Glutathione-agarose beads (1 ml) were incubated with lysates for 1 h at 4°C and then washed three times with 50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C. Mouse αC-adaptin (residues 2-938) and rat β-adaptin (residues 2-951) were expressed as fusion proteins with a 12-kDa leader sequence containing the HA-1 epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) using the expression vector pJG4-5(34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). The 5′-fragment of αC-adaptin cDNA was amplified from pBluescript SK using Pfu polymerase and two primers (5′-AGTCATCTAGAGAATTCGTATCCAAAGGGGACGGGATGCGAG-3′ and 5′-CATGGTGGATGATCAGGCTGATGGC-3′) to create an XbaI site and an additional EcoRI site at the 5′-end of the cDNA and to remove the first methionine. The XbaI/BclI fragment of the original cDNA was then replaced with the corresponding product of the polymerase chain reaction. The EcoRI fragment containing the whole coding region was then cloned into the EcoRI site of pJG4-5. The same two-step strategy was applied to clone β-adaptin cDNA into the same expression vector. Modified cDNA for β-adaptin in pBluescript SK with NdeI and EcoRI sites flanking the coding region (38Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used as template for the polymerase chain reaction. The oligonucleotides 5′-AGTCATCATATGGAATTCACTGAGTCCAAGTACTTCACAACC-3′ and 5′-AGTCATCCGAGGCGTCACTCGCTCACAGAT-3′ were used to amplify the 5′-fragment of the cDNA, to remove the first methionine, and to create an additional EcoRI site between the NdeI site and the beginning of the coding region. The NdeI/NsiI fragment of cDNA was replaced with the corresponding fragment of the amplified 5′-region, and the whole coding region of the cDNA was excised with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of pJG4-5. All constructions were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Both expression constructs were transformed into S. cerevisiae strain EGY48 and selected on Trp− medium. Expression of fusion proteins was induced by growth in 2% galactose. Cells were then spun down, washed with water, and resuspended in 50 ml of 100 mM Tris/SO4, pH 9.4, containing 20 mM dithiothreitol. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 5 ml of sorbitol buffer (1 MD-sorbitol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base). 1 mg (100 lytic units) of zymolyase was then added, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 30°C with continuous shaking. Spheroplasts were gently washed to remove zymolyase by two centrifugations using 50 ml of ice-cold sorbitol buffer containing 10 mM benzamidine and 1 mM EDTA. Spheroplasts were solubilized in 1 ml of IP buffer for 20 min at 4°C, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation. The observation that tyrosine kinase activity (6Honegger A.M. Dull T.J.

Therefore, we first analyzed the ability of two mutant EGFR with impaired autophosphorylation to form complexes with adaptors in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. One mutant EGFR (M721) contained a lysine-to-methionine change in the ATP-binding site of the catalytic domain, making it functionally and enzymatically inactive (5Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Another receptor (F5) lacking all known autophosphorylation sites was shown to retain signaling activity, but its autophosphorylation ability was dramatically reduced(43Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9176-9179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR were immunoprecipitated from mouse B82 cells treated without or with EGF, and bound material was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Consecutive reprobing of the same filter with antibody to EGFR, antibody to phosphotyrosine, and antibody to α-adaptin, which distinguishes plasma membrane adaptor AP2 from the AP1 adaptor complex of the Golgi apparatus, revealed that inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation dramatically reduced its ability to bind the AP2 adaptor complex in an EGF-dependent fashion. AP2 was detected in anti-EGFR Ab immunoprecipitates from EGF-treated M721 and F5 EGFR expressor cells, but the amount was much less than that associated with wild-type EGFR. To confirm that the observed EGFR/AP2 association took place in vivo and not after solubilization of cells, we confirmed the temperature dependence of complex formation reported by Sorkin and Carpenter(18Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to EGF at low temperature did not result in increased EGFR/AP2 association, presumably due to the increased viscosity of the lipid bilayer preventing receptors from reaching coated pits, but the ability of EGFR to autophosphorylate was not impaired. As shown in Fig. 1B, EGFR formed complexes with AP2 only after the cells exposed to EGF at 4°C were placed at physiological temperature. Association was detected at 5 min and was maximum after 10-15 min at 37°C. To directly investigate the role of EGFR autophosphorylation in ligand-dependent association with coated pit adaptors, a biosensor approach was used that allows study of interactions between molecules in real time. In this procedure, one of the molecules is immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip while a second is injected over the surface at a continuous flow rate. If the soluble molecule binds to the immobilized one, the refractive index of the medium at the surface of the sensor is changed in direct proportion to the bound mass. This change is detected using the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore™ instrument and is expressed as resonance units(44Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindqvist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 45Jonsson U. Fagerstam L. Roos H. Ronnberg J. Sjolander S. Stenberg E. Stahlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Ostlin H. Malmqvist M. Biotechniques. 1991; 11: 520-527PubMed Google Scholar, 46Jonsson U. Malmqvist M. Adv. Biosens. 1992; 2: 291-336Google Scholar). We first established that we could immobilize EGFR on the sensor surface, that tyrosine kinase activity was retained, and that EGFR could be reversibly autophosphorylated and dephosphorylated. Active EGFR was immunoisolated from A431 cells using Ab 528, which competes with EGF for receptor binding(47Gill G.N. Kawamoto T. Cochet C. Le A. Sato J.D. Masui H. McLeod A. Mendelsohn J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7755-7760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR was eluted from the 528 IgG column with excess EGF and injected over the biosensor surface containing immobilized Ab 13A9, which binds to the ectodomain of EGFR but does not compete with EGF(27Winkler M.E. O'Connor L. Winget M. Fendly B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Due to the high affinity of interaction, dissociation of EGFR from Ab 13A9 was negligible (Fig. 2). At the end of the EGFR injection, a base line was established, and monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY20 was injected before and after injection of ATP/Mn2+. As shown in Fig. 2, Ab PY20 bound the biosensor only after injection of ATP, demonstrating the ability of captured EGFR to autophosphorylate. Injection of Tyr(P) as a competitor completely eluted bound Ab PY20, confirming the specificity of the interaction. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was then injected to dephosphorylate immobilized EGFR. Phosphatase treatment abolished the ability of subsequently injected Ab PY20 to bind to EGFR. Failure of Ab PY20 to bind to EGFR was due to receptor dephosphorylation and not to proteolysis or other reasons because a second injection of ATP/Mn2+ restored binding of Ab PY20. The binding of the adaptor complex isolated from bovine brain to unphosphorylated and autophosphorylated EGFR was compared (Fig. 3). When AP was injected over the surface of the biosensor after immobilization of Ab 13A9 but prior to injection of EGFR, no significant binding was detected. EGFR was then captured on the biosensor, and AP was injected before and after ATP. The amount of AP bound to EGFR was significantly increased following injection of ATP/Mn2+, which allowed autophosphorylation of immobilized EGFR. The gradually decreasing base line reproducibly observed during injection of AP presumably reflects dissociation of a substance weakly associated with AP. Because Mn2+ is reported to cause aggregation of the intracellular domain of EGFR, implying a conformational change(48Mohammadi M. Honegger A. Sorokin A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hurwitz D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8742-8748Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), Mn2+ was also tested for effects on AP binding to EGFR. Mn2+ (5 mM) injection without ATP"

During development, TN-C displays a time- and a space-dependent tissue distribution with morphogenically significant boundaries. Each human TN-C subunit includes three types of structural modules: 14.5 epidermal growth factor-like repeats, 16 type III homology repeats, and a COOH-terminal knob made up of a sequence with homology to the globular domain of the β and γ chains of human fibrinogen (Fig. 1A). TN-C is coded for by a single gene, and its expression is regulated by a single promoter. Structurally and functionally different human TN-C isoforms are generated by the alternative splicing of the TN-C transcript, eight type III repeats being included or omitted in the mRNA (Fig. 1A)(5Gulcher J.R.

Although it is generally held that the pattern of alternative RNA splicing is only cell type-specific or developmentally regulated, its reversibility suggests that it might be tuned by extracellular cues, which enable cells to generate proteins with activities adequate to respond to mutated environmental conditions. Here we report that in cultured normal human fibroblasts, small pH variations of the culture medium (from 7.2 to 6.9) strikingly modify the alternative splicing pattern of the human TN-C primary transcript. Since such extracellular pH variations occur in many normal and pathological conditions, microenvironmental pH may be important for the regulation of RNA alternative splicing in vivo. Lung (GM-5387, GM-6114, WI-38, IMR-90, and MRC-5) and skin fibroblasts (GM-5757, GM-3440, GM-6113, and GM-5386) were obtained from NIGMS, Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). All the cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS, Boehringer Mannheim) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were utilized at passages 15-24, at least 7 days after seeding. In all the experiments described here, the different pH of the medium was obtained using different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate (from 5.0 to 60 mM). Identical results were obtained also modifying medium pH by HCl, NaOH, NH3, or HEPES, or growing the cells at different CO2 concentrations. Total RNA and poly(A)+ RNA were isolated from cultured cells using the procedure reported by Borsi et al.(14Borsi L. Carnemolla B. Nicolò G. Spina B. Tanara G. Zardi L. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses of 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were carried out using a human TN-C cDNA probe (HT-11) covering a DNA sequence common to all TN molecules(14Borsi L. Carnemolla B. Nicolò G. Spina B. Tanara G. Zardi L. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was used to normalize Northern blots. The cDNA probes were 32P-labeled using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Mono- and bidimensional analyses of the autoradiographic films (Trimax-XD, 3M, Savona, Italy) were carried out using an LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer (Pharmacia/LKB, Uppsala, Sweden). Cultured human skin and lung fibroblasts, at confluence, showed very different steady-state levels of the two TN-C mRNAs and corresponding proteins. In fact, while skin fibroblasts showed almost exclusively the 8-kb mRNA, lung fibroblasts accumulated mainly the 6-kb mRNA (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes C). However, lung fibroblasts have a much higher ability to acidify the medium with respect to skin fibroblasts, since they produce much higher quantities of lactate(15Harris C.C. Trump B.F. Stoner G.D. Methods in Cell Biology, Vol. 21. Academic Press, New York1980Google Scholar). Indeed, 7-8 days after plating, skin fibroblasts induce minimal pH variations in the culture medium while lung fibroblasts induce significant acidification. Identical results were obtained using the different cell lines indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Substitution of the media of confluent cultures of both lung and skin fibroblasts with media at different pH, followed by Northern analysis of the TN-C mRNAs, demonstrated that the environmental pH controls the steady-state levels of the two TN-C mRNAs. At a pH slightly above 7.0, fibroblasts from both skin and lung preferentially accumulate the 8-kb TN-C mRNA, while at pH below 7.0, they preferentially accumulate the 6-kb TN-C mRNA, irrespective of the chemicals used to modify the pH of the media. The presence or absence of 20% FCS or cytokines did not modify this behavior (Fig. 1, B and C). These results may be due either to modification of the RNA alternative splicing pattern or to a different instability of the two TN-C mRNAs in cells cultured in media with different pH. The results of the experiments shown in Fig. 2A demonstrated that the two TN-C mRNAs have equal instability at either pH 7.6 or 6.6. In skin fibroblasts kept in FCS-free media at pH 7.4 for 4 days, the 6-kb TN-C mRNA represented about 2% of the total mRNA, while at pH 6.7 it amounted to 98%. However, the total amount of TN-C mRNA (6 + 8 kb) did not show significant changes (Fig. 2, B and C). This finding rules out the hypothesis that the observed variation in the alternative splicing pattern may be due to an increase of the total amount of the TN-C primary transcript, with a possible saturation of some limiting factor(s) involved in the regulation of alternative splicing. In these experiments cells were incubated in FCS-free medium to isolate the effect of environmental pH from the effects of cytokines that are known to stimulate TN synthesis(16Pearson C.A. Pearson D. Shibahara S. Hofsteenge J. ChiquetEhrismann R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2977-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The present findings demonstrate that RNA alternative splicing may be considered not only cell type-specific or developmentally regulated but also, at least in the case of TN-C, controlled by microenvironmental pH variations. Considering that similar pH variations occur in vivo in many normal and pathological conditions and that it is very unlikely that such a control mechanism is evolved only for the TN-C transcript, environmental pH may be important for the in vivo regulation of RNA alternative splicing. This notion assumes even greater importance in light of the recent observation that organs in the human body are not homogeneous in terms of pH and that specific organ systems maintain a pH that is significantly different from the systemic pH(17Carlin K. Carlin S. Med. Hypotheses. 1993; 41: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Several reports have shown that the large TN-C isoform is expressed at the onset of important cellular processes that entail active cell migration, proliferation or tissue remodeling such as in neoplasia, in wound healing, and during development(8Borsi L.

These observations suggest that the extracellular pH, regulating the expression of the different TN-C isoforms, may be important in the regulation of cellular migration and proliferation. The intracellular events leading to pH-dependent alternative RNA splicing are for the moment only a matter of speculation. However, it is well established that modification of the microenvironmental pH induces, in normal cells, parallel modification of the steady-state intracellular pH(23Austin C. Wrai S. J.

The modulation of the alternative splicing of different primary transcripts induced by extracellular pH, as well as the molecular events which lead to such regulation, are presently under investigation.

INTRODUCTIONThe human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1human immunodeficiency virus, type 1dNTPdeoxynucleoside triphosphateRTreverse transcriptase. is the major etiologic agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 has been demonstrated to be important for viral replication (Goff, 1990; Fauci, 1988). The enzyme has been shown to possess three catalytic activities that are involved in the synthesis of double-stranded proviral DNA from the single-stranded RNA genome: RNA- and DNA-directed DNA synthesis and RNase H. The native enzyme is a heterodimer composed of a 66- and a 51-kDa polypeptide. The larger subunit has been shown to possess a DNA polymerase domain and an RNase H domain. The smaller subunit lacks the RNase H domain and is a maturation product of proteolysis of the 66-kDa subunit. The native enzyme utilizes its RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity for the formation of minus strand DNA synthesis. The RNase H digestion occurs during and after minus strong stop DNA synthesis (DeStefano et al., 1991; Gopalakrishnan et al., 1992; Furfine and Reardon, 1991; Fu and Taylor, 1992; Schatz et al., 1990; Wöhrl and Moelling, 1990). The DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT catalyzes the synthesis of plus strand DNA. Viral replication requires an orderly degradation of the RNA template during the formation of proviral DNA. Because of the multifunctional nature of HIV-1 RT and its absolute requirement for viral replication, the enzyme has been the subject of kinetic characterization and an attractive target for antiviral strategies. Any compound that inhibits the polymerase activity of the RT or causes an alteration of RNase H activity is likely to interfere with viral replication.So far, two classes of such inhibitors have been developed, distinguished by different inhibitory mechanisms. The nucleoside analogs 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine, 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine and 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine act by chain termination and are known to inhibit competitively with respect to dNTPs. Although currently in use for treatment of patients with AIDS, emergence of resistant viral isolates to these compounds and their cellular toxicity limit the success of continued therapy (for review, see Larder(1993, 1994)). On the other hand, the second class of chemicals, the nonnucleoside inhibitors, act at a site distinct from the polymerase active site (De Clercq, 1993). Kinetic characterization of HIV-1 RT inhibition by several members of this class has been performed. These include compounds such as nevirapine (Merluzzi et al., 1990; Kopp et al., 1991), calanolide (Kashman et al., 1992), derivatives of coumarin (Taylor et al., 1994), derivatives of benzodiazepines (Debyser et al., 1991; Gopalakrishnan and Benkovic, 1994; Pauwels et al., 1990), pyridinone (Carroll et al., 1993; Goldman, et al., 1991; Olsen et al., 1994), catechin derivatives (Nakane and Ono, 1990), and psychotrine (Tan et al., 1991). Nonnucleoside inhibitors have been reported to exert low levels of cytotoxicity. They are selective for inhibition of HIV-1 RT and in general are inactive against HIV-2 RT. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of HIV-1 RT complexed with nevirapine has revealed binding of the compound to a hydrophobic site adjacent to, but distinct from, the polymerase active site (Kohlstaedt et al., 1992). Moreover, the binding of nevirapine to two tyrosine residues at positions 181 and 188 in the conserved region has been demonstrated (Cohen et al., 1991; De Vresse et al., 1992). Interestingly a number of nonnucleoside inhibitors seem to share this region for their binding. Mutation at residues 181 and 188 has been shown to develop cross-resistance to a number of nonnucleoside inhibitors (for a review, see Larder(1993)).Detailed studies on the mechanism of inhibition of DNA polymerase activity of RT by nevirapine have been carried out (Kopp et al., 1991; Merluzzi et al., 1990; Shih, et al., 1991; Tramontano and Cheng, 1992; Wu et al., 1991). Their results indicated that the binding of nevirapine to RT is noncompetitive with respect to template-primer and dNTPs. However, studies to date have not addressed the mechanism of inhibition during a single round of RT binding to a heteropolymeric substrate. Furthermore, the action of nevirapine on RNase H activity of RT has not been characterized in detail.Several previous reports have suggested that when the RT is bound to a primer-template, the polymerase and RNase H active site contacts are separated by a fixed distance (DeStefano et al., 1991; Gopalakrishnan et al., 1992; Furfine and Reardon, 1991; Fu and Taylor, 1992; Schatz et al., 1990; Wöhrl and Moelling, 1990). When the RT was bound to a DNA primer recessed on a RNA template, the RT bound such that the polymerase active site contacted the 3′ region of the primer terminus. Under those circumstances, the primary position of RNA cleavage was 14-20 nucleotides upstream of the primer terminus. This is slightly smaller than the 20-nucleotide separation between polymerase and RNase H active sites predicted from the crystal structure of HIV-RT (Jacobo-Molina et al., 1993; Kohlstaedt et al., 1992). RNase H activity that is coupled to binding of the DNA polymerase active site was termed DNA polymerase-dependent RNase H activity (Furfine and Reardon, 1991; Gopalakrishnan et al., 1992). Minor cleavages are also observed after the first that are the result of a processive action of the RNase H carrying out endonucleolytic cuts that appear on either side of the initial cut (DeStefano et al., 1993). An alternate mode of cleavage, polymerase-independent RNase H activity, is less structure-specific and is the prevalent means of degrading RNA-DNA hybrids with RNA segments less than 19-20 bases long (Peliska and Benkovic, 1992). Hence, an alteration of RNase H activity or specificity by any compound is likely to affect the viral replication.We have extended the previous studies to investigate the effect of nevirapine on the kinetics of RNase H and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of RT. We have employed model primer-templates of defined length and measured the action of the RT during a single round of synthesis and cleavage on the substrate. Results show that nevirapine alters the cleavage specificity of the RNase H and also stimulates cleavage activity. Features of the inhibition of polymerase activity have also been elucidated.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRecombinant HIV-RT, having native primary structure, was graciously provided to us by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). This enzyme had a specific activity of approximately 21,000 units/mg. One unit of RT is defined as the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into nucleic acid product in 10 min at 37°C using poly(rA)•oligo(dT) as template-primer. Aliquots of HIV-RT were stored frozen at −70°C, and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. T4 polynucleotide kinase and T7 RNA polymerase were obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. RNase T1, bovine pancreatic DNase (RNase free), dNTPs, and rNTPs were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Radiolabeled ATP and rCTP were from DuPont NEN. Nevirapine (BI-RG-587) was obtained from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. The preparation of plasmid pBSM13+(Δ) has been previously described (DeStefano et al., 1992).Methods Run-off TranscriptPlasmid pBSM13+(Δ) was digested with BstNI, and 142-nucleotide-long run-off transcript was prepared using T7 RNA polymerase according to the procedure described in the Promega Protocols and Applications Guide(1991). The transcript was internally labeled using [α-32P]CTP. The DNA template was digested at the end of the reaction with RNase-free bovine pancreatic DNase I (1 unit/mg of DNA). The sample was passed through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Boehringer Mannheim) to remove free nucleotides. The sample was then mixed with an equal volume of 2 × gel loading buffer, heated at 90°C for 4 min, and then subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. The full-length transcript was located by autoradiography, excised from gel, and then eluted using the crush and soak method (Sambrook et al., 1989).To prepare 5′-labeled RNA transcript, run-off transcription was performed using unlabeled rNTPs. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed at the end of the reaction using a Sephadex G-50 spin column. The sample was then dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the 5′-phosphate. The enzyme was heat-inactivated and removed by phenol extraction. The dephosphorylated RNA was concentrated using ethanol precipitation and then 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase, according to the protocol described by the manufacturer. The free nucleotides were removed by spin chromatography, and the full-length transcript was gel purified as outlined above.RNA-DNA HybridizationAnnealing of the RNA and DNA was performed in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 80 mM KCl. The components were mixed together, heated to 65°C for 10 min, and then slow cooled to room temperature over a period of 90 min. Excess primer was removed by spin chromatography.Quantitation of Nucleic AcidsBoth 5′-end-labeled and internally labeled RNA samples as well as single-stranded DNAs were quantitated by a native gel hybridization “shift-up” assay procedure as described previously (DeStefano et al., 1993). In this assay, a labeled synthetic DNA oligomer (20-mer) of known concentration was allowed to hybridize with varying dilutions of RNA or DNA samples. After hybridization, the product was subjected to native gel electrophoresis. The concentration of the nucleic acid being quantitated was evaluated from the amount required to shift-up approximately 50% of labeled synthetic oligomer.Preparation of Single-stranded Circular DNAThe single-stranded pBSM13+(Δ) was obtained by following the procedure from the Promega Applications guide(1991).RNase H AssaysFinal reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1.0 mM EDTA, 34 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 2 nM substrate, and HIV-1 RT (2 units). The enzyme was preincubated with or without nevirapine at 4°C for 3 min. All other components except MgCl2 were added and incubated for 5 min at 37°C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 in a volume of 3.75 μl. Reactions were carried out for 15 min at 37°C, unless specified otherwise, and then terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 2 × gel electrophoresis buffer (90% formamide (v/v), 10 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 0.1% (w/v) each of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue). Products were visualized by autoradiography following separation on urea-polyacrylamide gels.RNase H Assays in Reactions Challenged with a Heparin TrapThe reaction conditions were the same as for the standard RNase H assays except that 8 μg of heparin trap was included along with MgCl2 at the start of the reaction. This modification limits the RNase H activity to preformed complexes of RT and the substrate (DeStefano et al., 1991). Any dissociating RT molecule is statistically much more likely to bind to the excess trap polymer present in the reaction mixture. This effectively prevents RTs from returning to the substrate to which they were originally bound. Assays challenged with the heparin trap allowed us to measure products formed during a single binding event of the RT to the substrate. A control reaction always was included to ensure the presence of adequate trap. In this reaction, enzyme was allowed to preincubate for 5 min with trap and substrate with the rest of the components of reaction prior to the initiation by the addition of MgCl2. This was used to establish the minimum concentration of trap necessary to eliminate synthesis in the control reaction. This level of trap was then used in the experimental reaction, since it can sequester essentially all dissociated RTs.Assays performed in the absence of heparin trap are referred to as standard RNase H reactions in the text. Assays carried out in the presence of the heparin trap are referred to as challenged RNase H reactions.RNA-dependent DNA Polymerase AssayThe final reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1.0 mM EDTA, 80 mM KCl, 2 nM substrate, 50 μM each of dNTPs, 6 mM MgCl2, and HIV-1 RT (2 units). The enzyme was preincubated with or without the nevirapine at 4°C for 3 min. All other components except MgCl2 and dNTPs were then added, with further incubation for 5 min at 37°C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a mixture of dNTPs and MgCl2 in a 3.75-μl volume. Reactions were carried out for 15 min at 37°C and terminated by the addition of 25 μl of 2 × gel electrophoresis buffer, as defined above. Products were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and analyzed.Reactions with trapping polymer were performed by including heparin (8 μg) at the start of the reaction. An appropriate trap control reaction wherein the trap was included in the preincubation mixture was always carried out. As with the RNase H assays, when heparin was included in the reaction, the reaction was referred to as a challenged polymerase assay.Preparation of RNA G-ladder and Base Hydrolysis LadderThe RNA G-ladder and base hydrolysis ladder were prepared by employing protocols supplied with the Pharmacia RNA sequencing kit.Substrate SequencesThe nucleotide sequence of the BstNI-digested pBSM13+(Δ) run-off transcript is 5′-GGGCGAAUUAGCUUUUGUUUAGUGAGGGUUAAUUCCGAGCUUGGCGUAAUCAUGGUCAUAGCUGUUUCCUGUGUUUCCUGUGUGAAAUUGUUGUUGUUAUCCGCUCACAAUUCCACAC-3′. The nucleotide sequences of the synthetic primers are as follows: primer 1, 5′-GTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGAT-3′; primer 2, 5′-CTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGAT-3′; primer 3, 5′-GAACAAAAGCTAATTCGCCC-3′.RESULTSEffect of Nevirapine on the RNA-dependent DNA Polymerase Activity of HIV-1 RTThe substrate to assay DNA synthesis consisted of a heteropolymeric RNA template primed with a 5′-labeled 20-nucleotide-long DNA oligomer (template-primer A) such that the product of full-length synthesis was 108 nucleotides long (Fig. 1). The effect of nevirapine on the length of products made by a single round of synthesis by the RT was examined. This measurement required use of a challenged polymerization assay as described under “Methods.” In this assay, the RT is prebound to the primer-template. Synthesis is then initiated in the presence of a trapping polymer, which sequesters the RT as soon as it dissociates. Fig. 2 shows results of an experiment testing the effect of increasing concentrations of the inhibitor on DNA synthesis. There is a dose-dependent effect of the inhibitor on the amount of synthesis. Titration of the inhibitor at lower concentrations does not significantly alter the profile of extension products. At higher concentrations, the average length of extension is clearly shortened. This suggests that the primary mode of action of the inhibitor at the lower concentrations is to prevent the RT from either binding the primer-template or initiating synthesis. At higher concentrations, the inhibitor also interferes with the actual process of primer elongation, decreasing the processivity of RTs that initiate synthesis. Interestingly, even at the highest inhibitor concentration, RTs that initiate synthesis proceed about 15 nucleotides before termination or dissociation.Figure 2:Effect of nevirapine on the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT. Template-primer A was employed as the substrate. The primer was 32P-5′-end labeled 20-mer DNA. HIV-1 RT was preincubated with or without nevirapine at various concentrations for 3 min at 4°C and subsequently preincubated with the substrate (2 nM) for 5 min at 37°C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2, trapping polymer heparin and dNTPs as indicated in the assay procedure. All reactions were carried out with excess trapping polymer heparin (see “Methods”) except the reaction that is shown in lane11, in which trap was omitted. Lane10 is a trap control reaction to demonstrate that the presence of excess trap in the preincubation mixture completely sequesters the RT. Products of the reaction were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel and visualized by autoradiography. Lanes1-9 show products of reactions in which the enzyme was preincubated with 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.5, and 0 μM nevirapine, respectively. The presence (+) or absence(-) of the trap in the reactions is indicated above each lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The above experiments were performed at 80 mM KCl concentration. In order to determine the action of nevirapine on RT polymerization reaction at lower salt concentration, we performed identical reactions at 34 mM KCl (data not shown). There was no noticeable difference in the level of inhibition by nevirapine at either salt concentration, indicating that the observed results are independent of salt concentration in the range we have employed.Effect of Nevirapine on the RNase H Activity of HIV-1 RT on Template-Primer AA challenged assay was also employed to evaluate the products made by the RNase H activity of the RT. As described in the Introduction, the primary site of RNA cleavage is expected at a distance of 14-20 nucleotides from the 3′ terminus of the primer. Using 5′-end labeled or internally labeled RNA templates, the products formed by the action of RNase H activity were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The 5′ labeled RNA template permitted us to positively identify products spanning the region from the 5′-end to the first cleavage site. The internally labeled substrate enabled us to simultaneously follow the pattern of products resulting from 5′, 3′, and internal regions. The substrate was chosen such that the smallest 5′-end product generated will be bigger than the largest 3′-end-derived products. Much smaller products result from the hybrid region, which we refer to as the internally derived products. By separation on denaturing gels, the origin of each of these labeled products can be easily identified.In the absence of nevirapine, a 5′ labeled product about 102 nucleotides long was observed (Fig. 3A, lane3). However, in the presence of nevirapine, there was an additional cleavage product about 98 nucleotides long (lanes1 and 2). Evidently, nevirapine facilitated movement of the RT in the 3′ to 5′ direction on the RNA, shifting the primary position of cleavage closer to the 5′-end of the RNA (compare lane3 with lanes1 and 2).Figure 3:Effect of nevirapine cleavage of template-primer A by the HIV-RT RNase H. PanelA is an autoradiogram of an experiment in which the RNA portion of the substrate is 5′-end labeled with 32P. In panelB, the RNA is labeled internally. Lanes1-5 are from reactions performed in the presence the trap, and lanes6 and 7 are from reactions without trap. Nevirapine concentrations 100 μM (lane1), 50 μM (lane2), and 0 μM (lane3) were used for trap reactions. Lane4 is a substrate control reaction that lacks the enzyme; lane5 represents a trap control reaction. Lane6 has no trap and no nevirapine and contains only the RT (2 units) and the substrate. Lane7 is same as lane6 except that the RT (2 units) was preincubated with 400 μM nevirapine. G-ladder and B-ladder were prepared using 5′32P-labeled template RNA by limited digestion with T1 RNase or base hydrolysis according to Pharmacia RNA sequencing protocol. The numbers in the left designate the length of the RNA (in nucleotides).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A standard reaction was also carried out in the absence of the heparin trap. In this case, the RT could interact multiple times with the primer-template. The difference in products made can be seen by comparing lanes6 and 7. It is clear that exposure of the substrate to repeated interaction with RTs ultimately leads to RNA cleavage products similar to those made by a single RT in the presence of nevirapine.Products made during cleavage of the internally labeled RNA are shown in Fig. 3B. When nevirapine was added to challenged reactions, distinctly more short internal products were produced. Compare lane3 with lanes1 and 2 in panelB. An increase in these products is also indicative of movement of RT on the substrate. A nevirapine-induced rise in the amount of this class of products is also observed in the standard reaction (compare lanes6 and 7, panel B).Effect of Nevirapine on the RNase H Activity of HIV-1 RT on Template-Primer BThe results with template-primer A showed that nevirapine facilitates movement of the RT toward the 5′-end of the RNA. This suggested that movement toward the 3′-end of the RNA may also be promoted. However, such movement may be restricted by the short hybrid region. To examine this possibility, a longer primer was employed. We used template-primer B, wherein the primer 2 binds the template such that its 3′-end is in the same position as the 3′-end of primer 1, but its 5′-end extends 10 nucleotides further (Fig. 1). Results of cleavage performed during a single interaction of RT with the 5′ labeled substrate are shown in Fig. 4A. The presence of nevirapine results in the expected formation of additional smaller 5′-end cleavage products (compare lane3 with lanes1 and 2). Interestingly, results using internally labeled RNA (Fig. 4B) show the nevirapine-induced formation of additional 3′-derived products (compare lane3 with lanes1 and 2). This indicates that nevirapine also enhances the movement of RT in the 3′ direction on the RNA template.Figure 4:Effect of nevirapine on the cleavage of template-primer B by the HIV-RT RNase H. PanelA is an autoradiogram of an experiment in which the RNA portion of the substrate is 5′-end labeled with 32P. In panelB, the RNA is labeled internally. Labels are as described in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As with template-primer A, nevirapine induced internally derived products can be seen (Fig. 4B, compare lane3 with lanes1 and 2). Again, these are indicative of an increase in the movement of the RT over the hybrid region. Also evident from the autoradiogram is a change in the pattern of products caused by the action of nevirapine in the reaction without trap (Fig. 4B, compare lanes6 and 7).Overall, these results show that nevirapine alters the cleavage specificity of the RNase H of HIV-RT. The apparent requirement for the primary cleavage site to be a fixed distance from the 3′-end of the DNA primer is relaxed. This results in prominent cleavages both 5′ and 3′ of the original primary cleavage site.Effect of Nevirapine on the RNase H Activity of HIV-1 RT on Template-Primer CThe substrates used to this point resemble the structure of the virus during the course of minus strand synthesis. At the completion of synthesis of the strong stop DNA and prior to the first primer strand transfer, the primer is extended to the 5′-end of the RNA template. To examine the effects of nevirapine on RNase H cleavage specificity at the end of the RNA template, template-primer C was employed (Fig. 1). A 20-nucleotide long primer (primer 3), which anneals to the 5′-most nucleotides of the RNA template was used. The products resulting from RNase H cleavage reactions performed in the presence and absence of nevirapine are presented in Fig. 5. When a 5′ labeled RNA template was used in the absence of nevirapine, cleavage products 16 and 17 nucleotides long were generated (Fig. 5, lane3). This result shows that the absence of a template extension ahead of the primer does not alter the positioning of the RT. Consequently, points of primary cleavage are the expected distance from the primer terminus. When nevirapine was added, additional products 13 and 14 nucleotides long predominated (Fig. 5, lanes1 and 2). Again nevirapine enhanced the movement of the RT in the 5′ direction and resulted in the additional cleavage products (Fig. 5, compare lane3 with lanes1 and 2). As with the previous substrates, smaller cleavage products were observed when the RT was allowed multiple interactions with the primer-template (compare lanes6 and 7). We also observed a slight decrease in the overall efficiency of RNase H cleavage on this substrate (template-primer C) compared with the previous substrates (template-primers A and B).Figure 5:Effect of nevirapine on the cleavage of template-primer C by the HIV-RT RNase H.

Products generated in the presence and absence of nevirapine are shown in panelsA and B respectively. It is evident that the nevirapine-induced change in cleavage position is essentially complete by the earliest time point of 15 s. A much less efficient secondary cleavage process, as described earlier (DeStefano et al., 1993), also occurs in the absence of nevirapine. Although the cleavage position appears to be the same as in the presence of nevirapine, the process is much slower, with product still continuing to accrue at 960 s.Figure 6:Time course of the effect of nevirapine on RNase H activity on template-primer B in challenged assays. Reactions were performed as described for the RNase H assay procedure. PanelsA and B show experiments using 5′ labeled RNA. PanelsC and D show experiments using internally labeled RNA. Reactions were conducted in the presence (50 μM) (panelsA and C) or the absence of nevirapine (panelsB and D) at varying time periods as indicated above the lanes. Aliquots of 25 μl were drawn at the indicated time periods.

In the case of the thrombin receptor, cleavage induces activation and irreversible receptor modification followed by rapid (T1/2 = 3 min) and extensive desensitization of the receptor's ability to modulate phospholipase C (Gq). 5-HT-induced desensitization of its receptor is markedly slower (T1/2 = 10 min) and by 60 min only 50% of the phospholipase C response is lost. This effect occurs with a parallel disappearance of 5-HT receptors from the cell surface. Whole cell phosphorylation studies showed that the thrombin receptor is rapidly phosphorylated upon activation. In contrast, the 5-HT2 receptor displays a low basal level of phosphorylation which is not increased upon agonist treatment. The cytoplasmic tail of the 5-HT2 receptor which contains several protein kinase consensus sequences was found not to be involved in receptor activation or desensitization. However, a chimeric receptor having the core of the 5-HT2 receptor and the cytoplasmic tail of the thrombin receptor was able to undergo 5-HT-induced desensitization and phosphorylation. These results indicate that (i) both 5-HT2 and thrombin receptors have unique shut-off mechanisms, and (ii) that sequences in the carboxyl terminus of the thrombin receptor are sufficient to trigger rapid uncoupling of the receptor from its G protein(s) and downstream effector(s).

Prompted by our observation that bone-seeking steroids regulate the β3 integrin subunit and cell surface appearance of αvβ3, we asked if cytokines effect expression, by murine osteoclast precursors, of the same heterodimer. We find that a number of cytokines augment β3 mRNA steady state levels, the most potent being IL-4. Transactivation of the β3 gene by IL-4 is followed by increased plasma membrane appearance of αvβ3 and specific enhancement of binding, by treated cells, of the αvβ3 ligand, vitronectin.

Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense cRNA were transcribed in vitro using Riboprobe → Gemini II transcription system (Promega) and digoxigenin-UTP (Boehringer Mannheim) and used as hybridization probes. Treated BMMs cultured in chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were washed three times with 100 mM phosphate buffer (PB,pH 7.4), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB for 30 min at 4°C. Slides were washed in 100 mM PB for 10 min and treated with proteinase K (5 mg/ml) for 10 min at 37°C, followed by refixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM PB for 10 min at 27°C, and acetylation by 100 mM triethanolamine, pH 8.0, with 0.25% glacial acetic acid. After washing twice with 100 mM PB for 1 min each, specimens were dehydrated through graded ethanol and air-dried. Each specimen was hybridized with 100 ml of hybridization solution (50% formamide, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 600 mM NaCl, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.25% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and labeled probe) and incubated at 50°C for 16-20 h in a moist chamber saturated with 50% formamide 4 × SSC. After hybridization, the specimens were washed with 50% formamide 2 × SSC for 30 min at 50°C, twice with 2 × SSC for 15 min each at 50°C, and twice with 0.2 × SSC for 15 min at 50°C. After washing briefly with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl (TS) with 1.5% non-fat dry milk for 30 min at 27°C, the specimens were incubated with 1:1000-fold dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) for 45 min at 27°C, washed twice with TS for 15 min at 27°C, and briefly with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2 (TSM). Development was carried out using Nitro-blue tetrazolium (175 ng/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (340 ng/ml) in TSM for 3 h at 27°C in the dark. After the reaction was stopped with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, the specimens were mounted with GEL/MOUNT mount (Biomedia, Foster City, CA). Treated BMMs were rinsed free of culture medium with PBS and surface labeled by 125I-lactoperoxidase (19Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M.

Each lysate, containing equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts, was precleared with protein G-Sepharose, (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-β3 integrin subunit antibody raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic portion of β3 integrin-specific amino acid sequence (kindly donated by Dr. L.

Preliminary studies were performed to determine antibody excess (10 mg/sample) which was used to quantitatively immunoprecipitate cell surface αvβ3. The precipitate, recovered with excess protein G-Sepharose, was boiled in electrophoresis sample buffer and subjected to 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions. The gels were dried and exposed at −80°C to Kodak X-OMAT film for 2 days and band intensity determined by photospectrometry. 96-well flat bottom plates (ICN Titertek →, Costa Mesa, CA) were coated with 100 ml of either mouse fibronectin (10 mg/ml, Telios, San Diego, CA) or vitronectin (10 mg/ml, Telios) for 16 h at 4°C. After washing twice with PBS and blocking with 100 ml of 10 mg/ml of heat denatured bovine serum albumin fraction V (Sigma) for 30 min at 27°C, 100 ml of suspended BMMs, containing 4 × 106 cell/ml, previously maintained in Teflon-coated plates, were preincubated with either non-immunized rabbit serum or polyclonal antihuman αvβ3 antiserum 2The antibody, raised against vitronectin receptor isolated from human placenta recognizes αvβ3 and αvβ5. We find, however, that IL-4 does not increase β5 mRNA expression by mouse BMMs (M. Inoue, unpublished observations). Hence, inhibition of IL-4-induced vitronectin binding reflects, in this circumstance, blocking of up-regulated αvβ3. (catalog no. 12119-012, Life Technologies, Inc.) (dilution 1:200) for 30 min and added to either vitronectin- or fibronectin-coated wells. Attached cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 20 min, rinsed twice with 10 mM borate buffer, pH 8.4, and stained with 1% methylene blue for 10 min. After washing three times with tap water, 100 ml of 0.1 M HCl were added to each well which was incubated for 1 h at 27°C. Absorbance at 650 nm was determined, which, as established in our laboratory, serves as a function of attached cell number(3Ross F.P. Chappel J. Alvarez J.I. Sander D. Butler W.T. Farach-Carson M.C.

As shown in Fig. 1, β3 integrin mRNA, extracted from M-CSF-dependent murine macrophages maintained in that cytokine (500 units/ml) for 24 h (control), migrates as a major 3.6 kb and minor 4.4 kb species. IL-4 increases steady state β3 message expression 5-fold. IL-6, GM-CSF, and TNFα also up-regulate β3 integrin subunit mRNA levels but are less effective, enhancing expression no more than 2-fold. IL-1β, IL-3, IFNγ, and hTGF-β2 on the other hand do not alter β3 message. Because IL-4 is the most potent of the agents tested, we further characterized its β3 inductive properties. We find the phenomenon is both dose- (Fig. 2) and time- (Fig. 3) dependent. β3 mRNA is enhanced after 6 h of treatment at a concentration of IL-4 as low as 10 units/ml. The effect maximizes (5-fold induction) 24 h after a single addition of 50 units/ml cytokine followed by a decline to basal levels at 72 h. In contrast to β3, IL-4 does not alter αv mRNA expression (Figure 2:, Figure 3:).Figure 3:IL-4 increases β3, but not αv, integrin mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. BMMs were exposed to a single dose of IL-4 (50 units/ml) or vehicle at time 0, and after various periods of culture equal amounts of total RNA analyzed by Northern blotting. IL-4 increases steady state levels of β3 integrin expression within 6 h of treatment. Maximal induction occurs by 24 h, followed by a decline to basal levels at 72 h. In contrast, the cytokine does not impact on αv mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results presented thus far do not distinguish between accelerated β3 gene transcription and message stabilization prompting us to perform nuclear run-on experiments. As shown in Fig. 4, IL-4 treatment of murine marrow macrophages specifically transactivates the β3 integrin gene. We have previously shown that our population of marrow cells consists exclusively of those dependent on M-CSF(16Clohisy D.R. Bar-Shavit Z. Chappel J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15922-15929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reflecting previous reports(20McInnes A. Rennick D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we also find IL-4 treatment of these cells promotes their multinucleation. This observation raised the possibility that β3 mRNA expression may vary between mono- and multinucleated cells, respectively. To address this issue, we performed in situ hybridization on control and IL-4-treated cells. As seen in Fig. 5, control cultures, containing only M-CSF, do not form polykaryons and express relatively low levels of β3 mRNA. While all IL-4-treated macrophages contain more β3 mRNA than do their untreated counterparts, the mononuclear population is particularly rich in the message. Having documented an agonistic effect of the IL-4 on β3 subunit mRNA expression, we asked if this event is paralleled by surface expression of αvβ3 integrin. As seen in Fig. 6, IL-4 up-regulates plasma membrane expression of αvβ3 dose dependently with maximal induction (3-fold) seen with 50 units/ml. Similarly, IL-4 augments surface expressed αvβ3 after 12 h of treatment with peak induction occurring by 36 h (Fig. 7). Because of apparent molecular mass and, more importantly, the fact that except in platelets, β3 associates only with αv, we reason that the β3-associated band migrating at 145 kDa is, in fact, αv. The greater intensity of the αv as compared to the β3 band (Fig. 6 and 7) reflects the fact that the former is more abundant in tyrosine residues(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar).Figure 7:IL-4 induces plasma membrane expression of αvβ3 in a time-dependent manner. BMMs were exposed to IL-4 (50 units/ml) at time 0 and β3 immunoprecipitates prepared as described in Fig. 6 with time. IL-4 augments surface-expressed αvβ3 after 12 h of treatment. Maximal induction occurs by 36 h. Mr, molecular weight marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next asked if enhanced expression of αvβ3 integrin under the influence of IL-4 is functionally significant. To this end, we compared the capacity of IL-4-treated and -untreated cells cultured in Teflon-coated plates to attach to immobilized vitronectin. Albeit less effectively than in adherent macrophages, IL-4 profoundly up-regulates β3 subunit mRNA levels and surface expression of αvβ3 in cells maintained in Teflon-coated plates (i.e. non-adherent) (Fig. 8). Mirroring the increase in αvβ3, IL-4 enhances vitronectin binding by previously non-adherent cells up to 5-fold, while not effecting attachment to fibronectin (Fig. 9). Importantly, anti-αvβ3 antiserum specifically blocks IL-4-induced vitronectin binding.Figure 9:IL-4 specifically enhances macrophage attachment to vitronectin. Murine BMMs maintained in Teflon-coated plates were treated with IL-4 (50 units/ml) or vehicle for 24 h and added to each well coated with either vitronectin (VN) or fibronectin (FN). IL-4 enhances vitronectin binding up to 5-fold, while not effecting attachment to fibronectin. Polyclonal anti-human αvβ3 antiserum completely blocks IL-4-induced vitronectin binding while non-immune serum has no effect. All values represent the mean ± S.D. of the ratio of binding of IL-4-treated cells/binding of the control cells from triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The advent of techniques whereby osteoclasts may be isolated or generated and maintained in culture has yielded insights into the mechanisms whereby these cells degrade bone. The resorptive process apparently requires formation, at the cell-bone interface, of an isolated microenvironment into which protons and acidic proteases are secreted(21Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Ghiselli R. Gluck S. Science. 1989; 245: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 22Blair H.C. Teitelbaum S.L. Schimke P.A. Konsek J.D. Koziol C.M. Schlesinger P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the means by which osteoclasts recognize and bind to bone are central to their degradative activity. The integrin αvβ3 is expressed on mature osteoclasts (23Zambonin-Zallone A. Teti A. Grano M. Rubinacci A. Abbadini M. Gaboli M. Marchisio P.C. Exp.

Recently, these observations have been extended to the whole animal as Fisher et al.(4Fisher J.E. Caulfield M.P. Sato M. Quartuccio H.A. Gould R.J. Garsky V.M. Rodan G.A. Rosenblatt M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1411-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) find that administration of echistatin, an RGD-containing protein recognized by αvβ3, inhibits bone loss in the oophorectomized rat. Interestingly, αvβ3 also serves, in avian osteoclasts, to transmit matrix-derived signals to the cells' interior, an event which may also impact on the rate of bone degradation(26Miyauchi A. Alvarez J. Greenfield E.M. Teti A. Grano M. Colucci S. Zambonin-Zallone A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. Hruska K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 266: 20369-20374Google Scholar). The importance of αvβ3 as a mediator of osteoclastic bone resorption underscores the rationale for exploring the means by which the heterodimer is regulated. We recently found that the bone-seeking osteoclastogenic steroids, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(6Mimura H. Cao X. Ross F.P. Chiba M. Teitelbaum S.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and retinoic acid(7Chiba M. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: S144Google Scholar), enhance surface expression of αvβ3 by marrow-derived, avian osteoclast precursors. Osteoclast precursors are hematopoietic and of monocyte/macrophage lineage(27Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Tanaka H. Sasaki H. Nishihara T. Koga T. Martin T.J. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7260-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). These cells acquire calcitonin receptors and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity as they mature and diminish expression of the vitamin D3 receptor(28Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Sasaki T. Nicholson G.C. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the latter being essential to osteoclast commitment(29Biskobing D.M. Rubin J Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 862-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With these observations in mind, and the demonstration that marrow-derived macrophage progenitors differentiate, in culture, into osteoclasts (28Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Sasaki T. Nicholson G.C. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), attention has turned to regulated expression, by these mononuclear cells, of osteoclast-associated markers. It is now clear that in addition to steroids cytokines such as IL-1 (8Akatsu T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Imamura K. Yamaguchi A. Sato K. Nagata N. Suda T. J. Bone Miner.

These observations prompted us to ask if, similar to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and retinoic acid, resorption-modulating cytokines impact on αvβ3 expression by osteoclast precursors. Because our steroid-based studies were performed on cells derived from chicken(6Mimura H. Cao X. Ross F.P. Chiba M. Teitelbaum S.L.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), a species for which few cytokines are available, we turned to M-CSF-dependent murine marrow-residing osteoclast precursors, cells we have previously shown can be isolated in homogeneity(16Clohisy D.R. Bar-Shavit Z. Chappel J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15922-15929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In light of our data that β3 mRNA expression parallels, and may regulate, αvβ3 plasma membrane capacity (6Mimura H. Cao X. Ross F.P. Chiba M. Teitelbaum S.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Chiba M. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: S144Google Scholar), we performed Northern analysis on these mouse marrow-derived cells. We used in these experiments a rat β3 cDNA, highly homologous to its human counterpart, reasoning that its homology would extend to the mouse. In fact, during these studies we cloned a mouse β3 cDNA which is more than 90% homologous to the rat probe. 3S. Kitazawa, F. P. Ross, K. McHugh, and S. L. Teitelbaum, unpublished data. Northern analysis of IL-4-treated macrophages is identical whether one uses the murine or rat β3 probe (data not shown). We find that IL-6, TNFα, and GM-CSF, each of which have been implicated in osteoclast precursor differentiation(9Jilka R.L. Hangoc G. Girasole G. Passeri G. Williams D.C. Abrams J.S. Boyce B. Broxmeyer H. Manolagas S.C. Science. 1992; 257: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 10Tamura T. Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Miyaura C. Tanaka S. Yamada Y. Koishihara Y. Ohsugi Y. Kumaki K.

Invest. 1987; 80: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), up-regulate expression of the β3 integrin subunit. Of the cytokines tested, however, IL-4 through transactivation of the β3 gene, most effectively increases steady state levels of the message, an event confirmed by in situ hybridization. In contrast, IL-4 has no effect on αv mRNA levels. β3 mRNA induction by IL-4 is paralleled by surface expression of αvβ3, suggesting the event may be functionally significant. To explore this issue, we developed a cell-matrix attachment assay using as a substrate, vitronectin, an RGD-containing protein and established αvβ3 ligand(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar, 2Larson R.S. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Reflecting plasma membrane αvβ3 capacity, IL-4 enhances anti-αvβ3 antibody inhibitable macrophage binding to vitronectin as much as 5-fold while not altering attachment to fibronectin, a circumstance mediated through β1 integrins(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the fact that exposure of murine peritoneal macrophages to IL-4 enhances their adhesive properties to plastic(32Stein M. Keshav S. Harris N. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). While this latter study offers no insight into the underlying mechanisms by which the cytokine promotes adherence, the experiments were performed in serum-containing medium, assuring an abundance of the αvβ3 ligand, vitronectin. IL-4 is an immunoregulatory cytokine produced by T-lymphocytes and mast cells, exerting a panoply of effects on mononuclear phagocytes(33Paul W.E. Blood. 1991; 77: 1859-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While reports are inconsistent, the body of evidence indicates the cytokine blunts macrophage proliferation(34Akashi K. Shibuya T. Harada M. Takamatsu Y. Uike N. Eto T. Niho Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, we were not surprised to discover that IL-4 is anti-osteoclastogenic in vitro(12Shioi A. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Welgus H.G. Suzuki H. Ohara J. Lacey D.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In keeping with this observation, we recently reported that overexpression of the cytokine in transgenic mice induces osteoporosis histologically similar to that often appearing in post-menopausal patients(14Lewis D.B. Liggitt H.D. Effmann E.L. Motley S.T. Teitelbaum S.L. Jepsen K.J. Goldstein S.A. Bonadio J. Carpenter J. Perlmutter R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11618-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this circumstance bone remodeling, a process initiated by osteoclastic activity, is markedly reduced. While being clearly anti-osteoclastogenic, IL-4 provokes macrophage precursor differentiation along an immunoregulatory pathway into cells primed to participate in an inflammatory response. For example, IL-4 induces major histocompatibility complex antigen (35Asano Y. Nakayama T. Kubo M. Fujisawa I. Karasuyama H. Singer A. Hodes R.J. Tada T. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 419-426PubMed Google Scholar) and mannose receptor expression (32Stein M. Keshav S. Harris N. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar) by murine macrophages, and as seen in this and another study(20McInnes A. Rennick D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), prompts their multinucleation. In this regard, IL-4 overexpression in transgenic mice induces a mononuclear inflammatory ocular lesion(36Tepper R.I. Levinson D.A. Stanger B.Z. Campos-Torres J. Abbas A.K. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 62: 457-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Given the fact that IL-4 is not expressed by murine marrow cells(14Lewis D.B. Liggitt H.D. Effmann E.L. Motley S.T. Teitelbaum S.L. Jepsen K.J. Goldstein S.A. Bonadio J. Carpenter J. Perlmutter R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11618-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that the cytokine plays a significant role in differentiation of resident macrophage precursors. On the other hand, inflammation is characteristically associated with profound cytokine expression, and it is in this milieu that IL-4 may exert its macrophage differentiating effect, prompting these cells along an antigen-presenting phagocytotic pathway and away from the osteoclast phenotype."

The TcR is a hetero-oligomeric complex assembled from the protein products of at least six different genes (reviewed in (3Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 487-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The polymorphic Ti-α and Ti-β chains form disulfide-linked heterodimers (Ti) and define the antigen specificity of the TcR. The Ti is noncovalently associated with the monomorphic CD3-γ, CD3-δ, and CD3-∊ chains and a disulfide-linked homodimer or heterodimer of chains belonging to the ζ family of proteins. The intracellular (IC) domain of each of the CD3 chains encompasses a YXXL-containing motif, first noticed by Reth(4Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), which consists of 6 mostly conserved amino acids (D/E-X7-D/E-X2-Y-X2-L/I-X7-Y-X2-L/I, in the single-letter code for amino acids, where X is any amino acid). It has been suggested that this motif is involved in activating signaling pathways operated by cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases(5Weiss A. Littman D. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). The CD3 and ζ family chains are thought to interact with cytoplasmic components, including protein-tyrosine kinases, that are directly involved in signal transduction. The IC domain of ζ and of CD3-∊ can induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation(6Irving B.A. Weiss A. Cell. 1991; 64: 891-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 7Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Science. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Google Scholar), and the IC domain of CD3-γ is involved in protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated down-regulation of TcR(8Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether CD3-γ and CD3-δ contribute to the protein tyrosine phosphorylation following TcR-mediated activation of T cells.

Interestingly, the Ti-α and Ti-β transmembrane (TM) domains contain 2 and 1 basic amino acids, respectively, whereas the TM domain of each of the monomorphic chains of the TcR contains a single acidic amino acid. Mutations affecting the charge of both basic residues in the Ti-α or the single basic residue in the Ti-β TM domain(9Morley B.J. Chin K.N. Newton M.E. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10John S. Banting G.S. Goodfellow P.N. Owen M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) prevent proper assembly and surface expression of the TcR in spite of the intracellular formation of disulfide-linked Ti-α•β dimers (11Alcover A. Mariuzza R.A. Ermonval M. Acuto O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4131-4135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Manolios N. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Science. 1990; 249: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Likewise, the charged residues of the TM domain of the CD3 chains have been found to be critical for CD3-Ti association but not for the formation of CD3-γ•∊ and CD3-δ•∊ dimers (13Hall C. Berkhout B. Alarcón B. Sancho J. Wileman T. Terhorst C. Int. Immunol. 1991; 3: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Manolios N. Letourneur F. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D.

These studies demonstrate the critical role of the charged amino acids in the TM domain of the TcR components and further indicate that domains other than the TM domain are involved in TcR assembly. The exact stoichiometry of the TcR is still not known; however, the CD3 chains are thought to be expressed within the TcR as noncovalently associated γ∊ and δ∊ dimers(16Blumberg R.S. Ley S. Sancho J. Lonberg N. Lacy E. McDermott F. Schad V. Greenstein J.L. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Koning F. Maloy W.L.

Med. 1991; 173: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Contradictory results concerning the requirement of CD3-γ and CD3-δ for TcR expression have been presented. Some studies have indicated that CD3-γ and CD3-δ may substitute for each other and that TcR containing either CD3-γ or CD3-δ are expressed at the T cell surface(19Alarcón B. Ley S.C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Kappes D.J. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In contrast to these observations, the TcR was not expressed at the cell surface in a murine T cell line lacking the expression of endogenous CD3-δ, although all other components of the TcR were present in these cells(21Bufferne M. Luton F. Letourneur F. Hoeveler A. Couez D. Barad M. Malissen M. Schmitt-Verhulst A.-M. Boyer C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 657-664PubMed Google Scholar). Surface expression of the TcR could be reconstituted by the introduction of exogenous CD3-δ or mutated CD3-δ lacking most of the IC domain into this CD3-δ-deficient T cell variant. Likewise, in a human T cell line lacking the expression of endogenous CD3-γ, the TcR was not expressed at the cell surface(22Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar). Partial complexes of Ti-α•β-CD3-δ•∊ were detected within the cells, but these complexes were not normally processed through the Golgi apparatus and did not associate with the ζ chains. When this CD3-γ negative T cell variant was reconstituted with exogenous CD3-γ, the TcR surface expression was restored. These two studies demonstrate that despite the high level of amino acid homology between CD3-γ and CD3-δ, these chains cannot substitute for each other in TcR expression. The aim of this study was to define domains of CD3-γ that account for the uniqueness of this chain, as compared with CD3-δ, in TcR surface expression and function. JGN cells, a TCR surface-negative variant of the human T cell line Jurkat lacking synthesis of the CD3-γ chain (22Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar) and cells of the original Jurkat cell line J76 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK) supplemented with 0.5 IU/liter penicillin (Leo, Ballerup, Denmark), 500 mg/liter streptomycin (NOVO, Bagsvzrd, Denmark), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sera-Lab Ltd., Sussex, UK) at 37°C in 5% CO2. UCHT1 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human CD3-∊ was obtained purified and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated from Dakopatts A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). HMT-3.2 hamster mAb against an epitope in the IC domain of human CD3γ was kindly donated by Dr. Ralph Kubo (Cytel Corp., San Diego, CA). F101.01 mouse mAb against a conformational epitope on the TcR was produced in our own laboratory(23Geisler C. Plesner T. Pallesen G. Skj⊘dt K. Ødum N. Larsen J.K. Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 27: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 4G10 mAb against phosphotyrosine was obtained purified and conjugated to agarose from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). The phorbol ester phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) was from Sigma. Chimeric CD3-γ/δs were constructed by fusing appropriate cDNA segments as described previously (24Wegener A.-M.K. Letourneur F. Hoeveler A. Brocker T. Luton F. Malissen B. Cell. 1992; 68: 83-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Wild type human CD3-γ chain and CD3-δ chain cDNA containing plasmids pJ6T3-γ-2 (25Krissansen G.W. Owen M.J. Verbi W. Crumpton M.J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and pPGBC9(26van den Elsen P. Shepley B.-A. Borst J. Coligan J.E. Markham A.F. Orkin S. Terhorst C. Nature. 1984; 312: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), respectively, were used as templates in a set of polymerase chain reactions together with the appropriate primers to generate the three CD3-γ/δ chimeric constructs shown in Fig. 1A. The primers flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends of each cDNA construct were designed to encompass a XbaI and a NcoI site, respectively. Chimeric polymerase chain reaction products were digested with XbaI and NcoI, subcloned into the 4.1- kilobase pair XbaI-NcoI fragment of pBluescript-βWT(27Geisler C. Rubin B. Bauguil S.C. Champagne E. Vangsted A. Hou X. Gajhede M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3469-3477PubMed Google Scholar), and sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method. The 1.8-kilobase pair XbaI-BamHI fragment of each of the pBluescript clonings were subsequently subcloned into the 5.9-kilobase pair XbaI-BamHI fragment of the expression vector pTβFneo (28Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. van den Elsen P. Yanagi Y. Yoshikai Y. Calman A.F. Terhorst C. Stobo J.D. Weiss A. Nature. 1985; 316: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and used for transfection. The different plasmid constructs were separately transfected into JGN cells by electroporation (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) at 270 V and 960 microfarads using 40 μg of plasmid and 2 × 107 cells. After 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium, cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/ml in 96-well tissue culture plates (Greiner GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418-sulfate (Geneticin) (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 3-4 weeks of selection, clones were expanded and maintained in medium without G418. Cytofluorometric analyses of cells stained with PE-conjugated UCHT1 were performed on a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) as described previously(22Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling studies were performed as described previously (22Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar).[35S]Methionine-labeled cells were lysed in 1% digitonin lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 mM iodoacetamide, and 1% digitonin), precipitated with the indicated mAbs, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cells were adjusted to 1 × 105 cells/ml of medium and incubated at 37°C with various concentrations of the phorbol ester PDB for 1 h and then transferred to ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum and 0.1% NaN3 and washed twice. Cells were subsequently stained directly with PE-conjugated UCHT1 and subjected to fluorescence-activates cell sorter analysis. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was recorded and used in the calculation of the percentage of anti-CD3 binding, (MFI of PDB treated cells divided by MFI of untreated cells × 100). 1.5 × 107 cells in 1 ml of RPMI medium were stimulated with 2 μg of anti-TcR antibody (F101.01) at 37°C for 30 s or 1, 5, or 20 min or left unstimulated. Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5) containing phosphatase inhibitors (2 mM EDTA and 1 mM vanadate) and protease inhibitor (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The postnuclear fractions were precleared with protein A-Sepharose, and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins immunoprecipitated with 4G10 mAb coupled to agarose beads (UBI). The beads were washed three times in modified RIPA buffer without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by one wash in TN buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl). For immunoblotting analysis, immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel under non-reducing conditions. The proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL from Amersham Corp.) at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 1 h and 10 min, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% dry skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline, and blotted with 4G10 mAb followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit-anti-mouse antibody (Dakopatts A/S). Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were visualized using the ECL enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.). To assess the role of the extracellular (EC), TM, and IC domains of CD3-γ in cell surface expression and function of the TcR, three chimeric CD3-γ/CD3-δ cDNA constructs were engineered (Fig. 1A). The CD3-γγδ construct corresponds to the EC and TM regions of the human CD3-γ protein fused with the IC region of the human CD3-δ protein. The CD3-γδδ construct corresponds to the EC region of the CD3-γ protein fused to the TM and IC regions of the CD3-δ protein, and the CD3-δγγ construct corresponds to the EC region of the CD3-δ protein fused with the TM and IC region of the CD3-γ protein. The EC domain of CD3-δ is 10 amino acids shorter than the EC domain of CD3-γ, whereas the CD3-γ and CD3-δ TM and IC domains contain an equal number of amino acids, in agreement with the relatively faster migration of CD3-δ protein in SDS-PAGE, compared with CD3-γ. The predicted CD3-δγγ chimeric protein was therefore expected to show a mobility in SDS-PAGE similar to that of CD3-δ, and the CD3-γδδ and the CD3-γγδ chimeric proteins were expected to show a mobility similar to that of CD3-γ. The different constructs, including a CD3-γ wild type (wt) cDNA, were subcloned into the pTβFneo expression vector (28Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. van den Elsen P. Yanagi Y. Yoshikai Y. Calman A.F. Terhorst C. Stobo J.D. Weiss A. Nature. 1985; 316: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and separately transfected into the CD3-γ negative human T cell variant JGN(22Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were isolated and the resulting cell lines were designated JGN-γγδ, JGN-γδδ, JGN-δγγ, and JGN-γwt, respectively. To determine whether introduction of the chimeric cDNA constructs directed the synthesis of corresponding chimeric proteins, each transfectant was metabolically labeled and lysed in digitonin. Aliquots of the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD3-γ and anti-CD3-∊ mAb. The precipitates were treated with or without endoglycosidase H (Endo H) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The anti-CD3-γ mAb used in this study is directed against an epitope in the IC region of CD3-γ and was expected to precipitate chimeric CD3-δγγ protein, but not CD3-γδδ nor CD3-γγδ (Fig. 1A). As expected, anti-CD3-γ did not precipitate any protein migrating at the size of CD3-γ from lysates of JGN-γγδ or JGN-γδδ (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6), whereas it precipitated a protein migrating at the size of CD3-δ from lysates of JGN-δγγ (Fig. 2, lanes 9 and 10). The anti-CD3-∊ antibody coprecipitated proteins migrating at the size of CD3-γ from lysates of both JGN-γγδ and JGN-γδδ (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) and a protein migrating close to the size of CD3-δ from lysates of JGN-δγγ (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 12). Based on these results, it was concluded that each transfectant expressed a protein in agreement with the cDNA introduced. Furthermore, each of the chimeric molecules associated with a protein complex containing CD3-∊. These results also established that none of the transfected chimeric molecules induced the expression of endogenous CD3-γ protein. To investigate whether the presence of any of the chimeric proteins induced surface expression of TcR, each transfectant was stained with anti-CD3-∊ mAb and analyzed by flow cytometry. CD3-γγδ and CD3-γδδ did restore surface expression of TcR, and clones expressing the TcR at a level similar to JGN-γ wt could be isolated (Fig. 1B). In contrast, CD3-δγγ did not lead to detectable surface expression of TcR (Fig. 1 B). These results demonstrated that the EC domain of CD3-γ plays a unique role in the cell surface expression of TcR. We have recently demonstrated the presence of partial Ti-α•β, CD3-δ•∊ complexes within the ER of JGN cells. These partial TcR complexes did not transit the Golgi apparatus as judged by the processing of the oligosaccharide side chains but were most probably degraded in the ER(22Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar). Because the introduction of CD3-δγγ into JGN cells did not restore TcR surface expression, we questioned whether the chimeric CD3-δγγ formed partial complexes encompassing Ti in JGN-δγγ cells and, if this was the case, whether such complexes matured further than the partial complexes found in non-transfected JGN cells. Cells were pulse-chase labeled with [35S]methionine, lysed in digitonin, and immunoprecipitated with anti-CD3-γ mAb. The immunoprecipitates were treated with and without Endo H and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Ti dimers could be precipitated from the JGN-δγγ lysate, as from J76 after a 30-min pulse (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 5 and lanes 3 and 6, respectively). As expected, no Ti chains were precipitated from JGN cells by anti-CD3-γ mAb, because no CD3-γ protein is synthesized in these cells, and the bands observed may be taken as nonspecific (Fig. 3, lane 1). After a 4-h chase period, very little or no Ti dimer was precipitated from JGN-δγγ lysate with anti-CD3-γ mAb (Fig. 3, lanes 8 and 11) and only immature Ti was precipitated from JGN-δγγ lysate with anti-CD3-∊ mAb (data not shown), as seen in non-transfected JGN cells(22Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the partial Ti-CD3 complexes encompassing chimeric CD3-δγγ chain detected after the pulse period had dissociated and/or degraded during the chase period, whereas other partial Ti-CD3 complexes encompassing CD3-∊ had not matured. We have recently shown that the IC domain of CD3-γ contains a motif that is involved in TcR down-regulation following PKC activation(8Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the IC domain of CD3-δ could replace the IC domain of CD3-γ with respect to this aspect of TcR function, the ability of JGN-γγδ and JGN-γδδ cells to down regulate the TcR following activation of PKC was analyzed. Both JGN-γγδ and JGN-γδδ cells showed strongly impaired PKC mediated TcR down-regulation as compared with JGN-γ wt (Fig. 4). To assess a possible role of the TM and/or the IC domain of CD3-γ in the protein-tyrosine kinase pathway activated through TcR, we analyzed the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation detected following TcR-mediated activation of J76, JGN-γδδ, and JGN-γγδ cells. The three cell lines showed phosphotyrosine proteins of similar size with comparable kinetics (Fig. 5). This analysis showed that neither the IC nor the TM domain of CD3-γ contributes to distinct phosphotyrosine proteins upon TcR-mediated activation. The four dimers (Ti-αβ, CD3-γ∊, CD3-δ∊, and ζ2) defining a minimal model of the TcR have to be coordinately assembled in the ER for efficient transport to and expression at the cell surface. Partially assembled complexes and unassembled subunits are not expressed at the cell surface but undergo degradation either within the ER or in lysosomes, a phenomenon termed architectural editing (reviewed in (29Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwarts J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 403-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Conflicting data concerning the role of CD3-γ and CD3-δ in TcR surface expression have been presented. Recent studies have demonstrated that endogenous CD3-γ cannot substitute for CD3-δ in a CD3-δ negative T cell line (21Bufferne M. Luton F. Letourneur F. Hoeveler A. Couez D. Barad M. Malissen M. Schmitt-Verhulst A.-M. Boyer C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 657-664PubMed Google Scholar) and that endogenous CD3-δ cannot substitute for CD3-γ in a CD3-γ negative T cell line (22Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar) in order to obtain surface expression of TcR. Furthermore, the lack of surface expression of the TcR on a HIV-1-infected T cell line has been correlated with a specific defect of the CD3-γ gene(30Willard-Gallo K.E. Van de Keere F. Kettmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6713-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These studies support a TcR model where both CD3-γ and CD3-δ are required for TcR surface expression. This is in agreement with a TcR model proposed by Manolios and co-workers (14Manolios N. Letourneur F. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) in which CD3-γ and CD3-δ pair in an obligatory fashion with Ti-β and Ti-α, respectively. In contrast, other studies of both T cells (19Alarcón B. Ley S.C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and non-T cells (20Kappes D.J. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have led to a TcR model where CD3-γ and CD3-δ may substitute for each other. In this model the TcR is expressed as two different isotypes containing either CD3-γ or CD3-δ. This model is supported by the description of a human T cell line isolated from an immunodeficient patient. Although this T cell line is deficient in the synthesis of CD3-γ, it expresses the TcR at the cell surface(31Pérez-Aciego P. Alarcón B. Arnaiz-Villena A. Terhorst C. Timón M. Segurado O.G. Reguerio J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These apparently conflicting models may reflect that the constraints controlling surface expression of the TcR are not the same in different cell types (T cells versus non-T cells) and are not the same in different T cells (e.g. immature versus mature T cells and certain malignant T cells versus others). One example of developmentally specific expression is the ability of pre-T cells to express the Ti-β chain at the cell surface in the absence of the Ti-α chain (32Punt J.A. Kubo R.T. Saito T. Finkel T.H. Kathiresan S. Blank K.J. Hashimoto Y. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Groettrup M. Ungewiss K. Azogui O. Palacios R. Owen M.J. Hayday A.C. von Boehmer H. Cell. 1993; 75: 283-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and the inability of mature T cells to do so (34Saito T. Weiss A. Gunter K.C. Shevach E.M. Germain R.N. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 625-628PubMed Google Scholar, 35Letourneur F. Malissen B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 2269-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A pre-T cell-specific glycoprotein, provisionally named gp33, was shown to be disulfide linked to the Ti-β chain on the surface of a pre-T cell line(33Groettrup M. Ungewiss K. Azogui O. Palacios R. Owen M.J. Hayday A.C. von Boehmer H. Cell. 1993; 75: 283-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). gp33 thus represents a developmentally regulated means of rescuing Ti-β from intracellular degradation and allowing surface expression. Likewise, certain T cell lines may have acquired means of rescuing TcR surface expression in the absence of one or more of the TcR subunits. The present study examines the structural and functional role of distinct domains of CD3-γ in the TcR of the human T cell leukemia Jurkat. Both the TM and the IC domains of CD3-γ could be substituted by the corresponding domains of CD3-δ without any detectable loss of TcR surface expression. JGN-γγδ and JGN-γδδ cells expressed comparable levels of TcR at the cell surface, showing that the efficiency of TcR surface expression was not affected by the substitution of the TM domain of CD3-γ with the corresponding domain of CD3-δ despite the limited amino acid homology (37%) between these domains. This observation is consistent with a requirement of the TM domain for conservation of hydrophobicity and a correctly located charged residue (a glutamic acid in CD3-γ and an aspartic acid in CD3-δ), rather than amino acid identity(36Cosson P. Lankford S.P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In contrast to JGN-γγδ and JGN-γδδ cells, JGN-δγγ cells did not show detectable surface TcR. These results demonstrate that the EC domain of CD3-γ possesses a unique role in TcR surface expression, as compared with CD3-δ, whereas the TM and IC domains do not. In studies of pairwise interactions between single TcR chains, only Ti-β and not Ti-α appeared to interact directly with CD3-γ(14Manolios N. Letourneur F. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 15Manolios N. Kemp O. Li Z.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Together with the present results, the specific interaction between Ti-β and CD3-γ is suggested to occur via the EC domain of CD3-γ when these chains are expressed in the context of the full TcR. Ti, CD3-∊, and CD3-δγγ formed partial complexes within JGN-δγγ cells. Due to the similar migration of endogenous CD3-δ and CD3-δγγ proteins, it was not possible to distinguish whether CD3-δ was also part of CD3-δγγ containing partial complexes. From previous studies we know that CD3-δ does form partial complexes with Ti and CD3-∊ in non-transfected JGN cells(22Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445PubMed Google Scholar). Partial complexes within JGN-δγγ may thus be composed of a minimum of either two dimers (Ti and CD3-δγγ•∊, or Ti and CD3-δ•∊), suggesting that CD3-δγγ is alternative to CD3-δ at this level, or three dimers (Ti, CD3-δγγ•∊, and CD3-δ•∊) suggesting that CD3-δγγ is in addition to CD3-δ. Irrespective of the composition of the partial complexes, the fate of the Ti dimer in JGN and JGN-δγγ could not be distinguished. In both cells partial complexes were formed in a pre-Golgi compartment, probably the ER, but no maturation of Ti could be detected. The study of the fate of partial complexes in a ζ negative variant of a murine T cell line demonstrated that partial Ti-CD3 complexes may reach the lysosomes in the absence of ζ (reviewed in ref. 29). This implies that partial hexameric complexes can mature in the Golgi apparatus before being sorted to the lysosomes. If this is also true in the Jurkat system, supposing that Ti, CD3-δγγ•∊, and CD3-δ•∊ do form partial hexameric complexes, it may be speculated that the substitution of the EC domain of CD3-γ with that of CD3-δ results in the loss of a signal patch that otherwise allows such partial complexes to mature in the Golgi apparatus or that such complexes have a short half-life. Alternatively, it may be suggested that the substitution of the EC domain hinders the association of ζ to the partial TcR complexes and that the absence of this association prevents the maturation in the Golgi apparatus. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CD3-γ has been suggested to act as a negative feedback signal that controls the level of surface TcR and/or the function of TcR(37Cantrell D. Davies A.A. Londei M. Feldman M. Crumpton M.J. Nature. 1987; 325: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Among other substrates, PKC phosphorylates CD3-γ at serine 126 (γS126) and possibly also γS123(38Alexander D.R. Brown M.H. Tutt A.L. Crumpton M.J. Shivnan E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) positioned 10 and 7 amino acids COOH-terminal from the TM domain, respectively (numbering according to (25Krissansen G.W. Owen M.J. Verbi W. Crumpton M.J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the IC domain of CD3-γ contains a phosphoserine-dependent di-leucine motif involved in down-regulation of the TcR(8Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). PKC-mediated down-regulation of the TcR expressed on JGN cells reconstituted with a S126V point-mutated CD3-γ chain (JGN-γS126V) was strongly inhibited as compared with JGN-γS123V and JGN-γ wt cells(8Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and it was concluded that γS126, but not γS123, is required for efficient PKC-mediated TcR down-regulation. The IC domain of CD3-δ also displays a di-leucine motif and has serine (δS113) at a position corresponding to γS123, but has alanine (δA116) at a position corresponding to γS126. Although CD3-δ may also be a substrate for PKC(39Cantrell D. Davies A.A. Crumpton M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8158-8162Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), endogenous CD3-δ does not contribute significantly to PKC-mediated TcR down-regulation(8Dietrich J. Hou X. Wegener A.-M.K. Geisler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2156-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This may be because CD3-δ differs in amino acid sequence from CD3-γ, notably by the “lack” of δS116. Alternatively, the geometrical position of CD3-δ within the TcR may have an impact on the function of the IC domain of CD3-δ. In the present study, the geometrical positions of the CD3-γγδ and the CD3-γδδ chimers within the TcR on JGN-γγδ and JGN-γδδ cells, respectively, are imagined to be similar to that of CD3-γ within the TcR on JGN-γ wt cells, as this position is assumed to be directed by the CD3-γ EC domain. By inference, the CD3-δ IC domain of either chimer may be positioned within the TcR similar to the CD3-γ IC domain of a normal TcR. However, JGN-γγδ and JGN-γδδ cells were functionally similar to JGN-γS126V cells, because they showed impaired PKC-mediated down-regulation of TcR. This result suggests that this specialized function of the IC domain of CD3-γ, as compared with that of CD3-δ, is a consequence of its specific amino acid sequence and not of its geometrical position within the TcR. The qualitative pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins following anti-TcR stimulation of J76, JGN-γδδ, and JGN-γγδ cells was similar and may reflect one of three underlying situations; the IC domain of CD3-γ and CD3-δ serve similar functions and either connect to protein-tyrosine kinases with similar substrate specificity or do not connect to protein-tyrosine kinases at all, or CD3-δ, but not CD3-γ, connects to protein-tyrosine kinases. Assuming that the YXXL-containing motif in both chains is involved in signal transduction, this would mean that the YXXL motif is redundant or that the YXXL motif may connect to a non-protein-tyrosine kinase signal-transducing pathway (e.g. through association with serine/threonine kinase Raf(40Loh C. Romeo C. Seed B. Bruder J.T. Rapp U. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8817-8825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the CD3 chains may be divided in two. First, they play a structural role in controlling the assembly and intracellular transport of the TcR, and second, once expressed on the cell surface, they are involved in ligand-triggered signal transfer across the membrane and in regulating the TcR density at the cell surface. It has been suggested that the CD3-γ and CD3-δ arose from a duplicated gene and that these chains have adopted separate functions(25Krissansen G.W. Owen M.J. Verbi W. Crumpton M.J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with our findings with regard to their respective structural role in TcR assembly. With regard to function, their respective TM and IC domains seem to have adopted both distinct and overlapping functions.

https://openalex.org/W1970489275,"Two sites on tenascin mediate interactions with glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. One is situated on the fibrinogen-like domain, whereas the other lies within the fibronectin type III homology region (Aukhil, I., Joshi, P., Yan, Y. Z., and Erickson, H. P.(1993) J. Biol.

This is confirmed in solid phase assays by incubation of fusion proteins with biotin-labeled heparin. In addition, we demonstrate the binding of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate to domain five. Molecular modelling of this domain reveals a conserved heparin-binding motif that we propose as the putative binding site.

Tenascin-C is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein implicated in pattern formation during development and in malignant progression. It commonly occurs as a homohexamer, each polypeptide chain disulfide linked at its amino terminus to give the characteristic hexabrachions observed in electron microgaphs(1Erickson H.P. Iglesias J.L. Nature. 1984; 311: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 2Vaughan L. Huber S. Chiquet M. Winterhalter K.H.

Each tenascin polypeptide is composed of colinear domains, similar to epidermal growth factor, fibronectin type III domains (TNfn) 1The abbreviations used are: TNfnfibronectin type III homology domain of tenascinECMextracellular matrixTNfbgfibrinogen like domain of tenascinHSheparan sulfateGAGglycosaminoglycanTBSTris-buffered saline. or fibrinogen (TNfbg)(4Spring J.

In chick, for example, three major tenascin variants exist with either one (TN200) or three (TN220) additional TNfn domains inserted between TNfn5 and TNfn6 of the TN190 variant (Fig. 1). fibronectin type III homology domain of tenascin extracellular matrix fibrinogen like domain of tenascin heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan Tris-buffered saline. The alternatively spliced region has been linked to ligand binding of tenascin. Contactin/F11, a neuronal cell receptor anchored in the membrane by glycosyl phosphatidylinositol, is a ligand for tenascin-C and binds specifically to the TN190 isoform(6Zisch A.H. D'Alessandri L. Ranscht B. Falchetto R. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the recent isolation and identification of a 35-kDa cell surface tenascin-C receptor as annexin II, which binds specifically to the alternatively spliced region itself(7Chung C.Y. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As annexin II binds within the alternatively spliced region and contactin/F11 is specific for the TN190 variant, missing these domains, alternative signaling may be mediated by different tenascin-C isoforms, underlining the functional importance of this region. Consistent with a functional role, the expression of these variants is closely regulated during development. For example, embryonic cartilage contains only the TN190 isoform(2Vaughan L. Huber S. Chiquet M. Winterhalter K.H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Tucker R.P. Development. 1993; 117: 347-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the TN220 isoform expression is timed to pave the migration of neural crest cells in the cornea(3Kaplony A. Zimmermann D.R. Fischer R.W. Imhof B.A. Odermatt B.F. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. Development. 1991; 112: 605-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another prominent group of ligands are proteoglycans, some of which interact with tenascin-C through their glycosaminoglycan moieties. This includes the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans cytotactin-binding proteoglycan(9Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2523-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and receptor tyrosine phosphatase β (10Barnea G. Grumet M. Milev P. Silvennoinen O. Levy J.B. Sap J. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14349-14352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the heparan sulfate proteoglycans syndecan (11Salmivirta M. Elenius K. Vainio S. Hofer U. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7733-7739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glypican(12Vaughan L. Zisch A.H. Weber P. D'Alessandri L. Ferber P. David G. Zimmermann D.R. Winterhalter K.H. Contrib. Nephrol. 1994; 107: 80-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the latter two, binding occurs in part through the heparan sulfate chains. In contrast to contactin/F11 and annexin II, the binding sites of these proteoglycans have yet to be established. As a first step in this direction, the binding of tenascin to heparin has been investigated. Tenascin-C can be isolated over heparin-Sepharose(13Marton L.S. Gulcher J.R. Stefansson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13145-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an interaction that may be due to one of two putative heparin-binding regions(14Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that one of these sites lies within the TNfn region and may be adjacent to the functionally important alternatively spliced domains, we prepared recombinant protein fragments covering this region of chick tenascin-C. Here we demonstrate that this heparin-binding site is located on TNfn5. With molecular modelling, we show that the Tnfn5 domain contains a cluster of basic amino acids that forms a conserved heparin binding motif. Chondroitin sulfates A and C (chondroitin sulfate A from bovine trachea and chondroitin sulfate C from shark cartilage), dermatan sulfate (DS from bovine mucosa), heparan sulfate (HS from bovine kidney) and heparin (from porcine intestinal mucosa), avidin, and 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid (HABA) reagent from Pierce, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and protamine sulfate was from Eli Lilly & Co.

The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis broad range molecular weight standards are from Bio-Rad. Ni-NTA resin was from Qiagen (Germany), and factor Xa was from New England Biolabs, Inc. Rabbit anti-tenascin antibodies have been described previously (3Kaplony A. Zimmermann D.R. Fischer R.W. Imhof B.A. Odermatt B.F. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. Development. 1991; 112: 605-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Caltag Laboratories. TNfbg (14Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Harold P. Erickson. The chicken tenascin cDNA clone pCTN230 was generously provided by Ruth Chiquet-Ehrismann. All other chemicals were from Fluka (Switzerland). The alternatively spliced fibronectin type III domains TNfn56, TNfn5D, TNfnD6, and TNfn5ABD6 were expressed as fusion proteins in a bacterial expression system(15Stüber D. Matile H. Garotta G. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 4: 121-152Crossref Google Scholar). Expression constructs were prepared essentially according to (16Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments encoding the TNfn domains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the full-length construct pCTN230 (donated by Dr. R. Chiquet-Ehrismann). The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into the multiple cloning site of pDS9 (16Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) yielding in the constructs pDS9/56, pDS9/5D, and pDS9/D6. The multiple cloning site is located at the 3′ end of the translation initiation codon and a sequence coding for 6 histidines. To obtain the construct pDS9/5ABD6, we digested the construct pDS9/56 with BstXI and ligated into the remaining plasmid the appropriate fragment of a BstXI digestion of pCTN230. All constructs were controlled by DNA sequencing. The amino and carboxyl termini of the resultant fusion proteins are presented in Table 1.Tabled 1 Recombinant proteins containing a stretch of 6 histidines amino-terminal of the factor Xa cleavage site were prepared from M15 (pREP4), transformed with the constructs pDS9/56, pDS9/5D, pDS9/D6, or pDS9/5ABD6, respectively. Transformed bacteria were grown at 37°C overnight in a rotary shaker (250 rpm) in 2 × YT medium containing ampicillin and kanamycin. The production of the fusion proteins was initiated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside as described(15Stüber D. Matile H. Garotta G. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 4: 121-152Crossref Google Scholar). After 5 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in one-thirtieth of the original volume in ice-cold sonification buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl; 150 mM NaCl; 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 2 mM iodacetamide; pH 8.0) and lysed in aliquots of 15 ml with a sonifier (cell disrupter, SKAN; setting 4, 6 min, 75%). During the sonification, the suspension was cooled with ice-water. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C (Sorvall, SS34). The fusion protein containing supernatant was diluted with 1.5 volumes of loading buffer (67 mM sodium phosphate; 300 mM NaCl; 0.02% NaN3; pH 8.0) and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column. Under these conditions, fusion proteins containing the 6-His tag bound tightly to the column, whereas other bacterial proteins were eluted with washing buffer (67 mM sodium phosphate; 300 mM NaCl; 0.02% NaN3; pH 6.0). The fusion proteins were subsequently eluted with 100 mM sodium acetate; 300 mM NaCl; 0.02% NaN3; pH 3.8. The pH of the collected fractions was adjusted to 7.5 with 1 M Tris/HCl, pH10, and subjected to analysis on 10-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The affinity chromatography with the fusion proteins on heparin-Sepharose was carried out as follows. The fusion protein concentration was adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml in Tris buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl; 20 mM NaCl; 0.02% NaN3; pH 7.5), and 1 ml was applied to the heparin-Sepharose column. The column was washed with the Tris buffer and subsequently eluted with a linear salt gradient from 20 mM to 1.5 M NaCl. The fractions were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal rabbit anti-tenascin antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. The glycosaminoglycans were labeled with biotin as described(17Debbage P.L. Lange W. Hellmann T. Gabius H.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The amount of biotin/unit of glycosaminoglycan was estimated using the HABA-avidin reagent. To avoid precipitation during the color reaction, the biotin-labeled glycosaminoglycans were first digested at 37°C overnight by the addition of chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) or heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8). The concentrations of biotin in these solutions were then determined as described by the supplier. The labeled glycosaminoglycans were used in solid phase assays for which 96-well plates were coated at room temperature overnight with 100 μl/well of fusion protein diluted to final concentration of 1 μM in TBS. Protamine sulfate coated at a concentration of 100 μg/ml was used as a positive control; 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS was used as negative control. Where bacterial proteins were used as negative control, dilutions with an OD (1 cm; 280 nm) of 0.1 in TBS were applied. The wells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 200 μl of 1% heat denatured bovine serum albumin in TBS (5 min, 85°C). The binding of glycosaminoglycans was performed for 2 h at room temperature. Bound biotin labeled glycosaminoglycans were detected with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to streptavidin (1:2500) in TBS and p-nitrophenyl phosphate-Na2 as substrate. Between each step, the wells were washed 3 times with 200 μl of TBS. Chicken TNfn5 was modelled based on the known structure of human TNfn3(18Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The structure of TNfn3 was obtained as file “pdb1ten.ent” from the Protein Data Bank at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The human TNfn3 contains two additional amino acids (Ile-838 and Glu-852 in TNfn3) compared with chicken TNfn5. To model the chicken TNfn5, we deleted first these 2 amino acids with the program RIMINI (molecular mechanics program for rings; M. Dobler, ETH Zürich, 1989). In a first step, we deleted the Ile at the end of the β-strand C. The β-strands C and C′ were held in place, and 2 amino acids amino-terminal and 6 amino acids carboxyl-terminal of the deleted Ile were moved by changing their torsion angles to close the nick. With the same procedure, the Glu between the β-strands C′ and E was deleted. These two β-strands were held in place, and 3 amino acids on either side of the deleted Glu were moved to close the gap. The calculations with RIMINI were performed on a VAX 9000-420. In a second step, the amino acids were mutated with the program QUANTA version 3.3 from Molecular Simulations running on a personal IRIS 4D25G. After mutating the amino acids, their side chains were orientated using the rotamer tool. A CHARMm minimization of this structure resulted only in small changes, suggesting that the model obtained of chicken TNfn5 is reasonable. Comparing the sequences of our constructs with the published sequence ((5Jones F.S. Hoffman S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), M23121) revealed a point mutation in the domain five (nucleotide 3200: C→A), changing the amino acid 989 in the published sequence from a Thr to an Asn. The latter corresponding to the human (M55618, X56160) and mouse (D90343, X56304) sequence. Sequencing showed the mutation was already present in the pCTN230 construct. A second mutation was observed in domain D (nucleotide 3915: A→C) of the construct 5D but not D6. The nucleotide substitution changes the amino acid 1227 from a Glu to an Asp. This mutation close to the priming site of DL2 was introduced by polymerase chain reaction and could not be avoided by repeating the polymerase chain 1 reaction with the same or other primers. After sonification and centrifugation of the bacteria, about 95% of fusion protein can be recovered from the supernatant, whereas 5% remains in the pellet. The fusion proteins are soluble in isotonic buffer and do not require additional agents for solubilization. The highest yield of fusion protein is obtained with the bacteria expressing TNfnD6, where from 1 liter of bacteria culture, 160 mg of TNfnD6 is isolated. The recoveries of the fusion proteins TNfn56, TNfn5D, and TNfn5ABD6 are approximately 3-5 mg of fusion protein/liter of bacterial culture. The one-step purification over a Ni-NTA column yields fusion proteins free of contaminants and soluble in isotonic solution (Fig. 2). The amino-terminal fusion sequence is readily removed by factor Xa. The resulting polypeptide includes the correct amino-terminal sequence and covers only sequences specific for tenascin. TNfn5ABD6, the fusion protein containing all domains of the variably spliced region of chicken tenascin, displays moderate affinity to heparin-Sepharose, being eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in a major peak at about 0.6 M NaCl (Fig. 3). To examine whether binding is due to a site within the alternatively spliced region itself or on the neighboring domains TNfn5 or TNfn6, fusion proteins TNfn56 and TNfnD6 were applied to the column. TNfnD6 elutes in the break-through without binding. In contrast, TNfn56 is retained by the heparin-Sepharose and elutes with 0.6 M NaCl, indicating that TNfn5 carries the heparin-binding site. Nonspecific interactions resulting from the net charge of the fusion proteins (Table 2) is unlikely, as TNfn5ABD6 with pI 5.01 binds just as well to the heparin column as TNfn56 with a pI of 10.08. Although TNfnD6 has pI 6.1 and is therefore similarly charged at pH 7.5 as TNfn5ABD6, it is not retained by the heparin column.Tabled 1 To further investigate the heparin binding of different fusion proteins directly, a solid phase assay was established using biotin-labeled heparin and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. On average, 25 biotins (range 16-36) were introduced per 1000 disaccharide units of glycosaminoglycan, as estimated using the HABA-avidin reagent. This permitted ready detection, without unduly influencing the properties of the glycosaminoglycans themselves. First, we examined the effect of increasing NaCl concentrations on the binding of heparin to fusion proteins. Protamine sulfate, TNfn56, TNfn5D, TNfnD6, and TNfn5ABD6 were coated in TBS, and, after incubating heparin at 150 mM NaCl with these substrates, washing was performed under increasing NaCl concentrations (Fig. 4). Heparin binds to all fusion proteins carrying the TNfn5 domain (TNfn56, TNfn5D, or TNfn5ABD6) but not to TNfnD6. The binding to TNfn5 decreases with increasing NaCl concentrations and is fully abolished between 450 and 600 mM NaCl, similar to the concentration required to elute TNfn56 from heparin-Sepharose. The binding of heparin to protamine sulfate is not influenced by the NaCl concentrations tested. In a separate set of experiments (not shown), the binding of heparin to TNfn56 was found to be saturable. The binding to TNfn56 was also similar to that between heparin and the fibrinogen-like domain of tenascin, consistent with previously published data(14Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As heparin itself is unlikely to be the physiological ligand for tenascin-C, we incubated various biotin-labeled glycosaminoglycans in the solid phase assay with TNfn56 as substrate. Both heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate bind to TNfn5 with a similar half-maximal concentration of around 50 μg/ml (Fig. 5). Half-maximal binding of heparin occurs at 0.8 μg/ml, indicating a 50-100 fold greater affinity. Neither chondroitin sulfate A nor chondroitin sulfate C bind to TNfn56 under these conditions. Here we present evidence for a conserved heparin binding site in tenascin-C on the TNfn5 domain. This conclusion is based on the binding of heparin at physiological NaCl concentrations to fusion proteins containing TNfn5. This is true for the fusion proteins derived from chicken tenascin, shown here, and for fusion proteins derived from human tenascin(14Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin binds most strongly of the glycosaminoglycans tested, likely due to its higher level of modification. Heparin and heparan sulfate differ in their degree of sulfation and extent of epimerization of D-glucuronic to L-iduronic acid(19Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). The lower affinity of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate may not only be explained by their lower degree of sulfation, but also by their reduced content of L-iduronic acid. The latter may be essential for the binding to TNfn5, as glycosaminoglycans lacking L-iduronic acid (chondroitin sulfates A and C) did not bind to TNfn5. Involvement of L-iduronic acid has also been observed for the binding of heparin or heparan sulfate to basic fibroblast growth factor(20Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U.. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functional conservation of heparin binding between chicken and human TNfn5 implies that the binding site itself must also be conserved. To identify this binding site within domain five, we modeled chicken TNfn5 (Fig. 6), based on the known structure of human TNfn3(18Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The fibronectin type III repeats are formed from two β-sheets, giving rise to a minor face of three β-strands (designated A, B, and E) and a major face of four β-strands (C, C′, F, and G). The β-strands F and G, shown facing the viewer in Fig. 6, contain a consensus heparin-binding motif (BXBXBXXXXB)(22Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is highly conserved in tenascin-C between different species ranging from chick, mouse, human, and pig(23Vaughan L. Weber P. D'Alessandri L. Zisch A. Winterhalter K.H. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 43-52PubMed Google Scholar). The spacing between residues Lys-1032 and Lys-1039 (Table 3), which are separated by 21 Å in the model (Fig. 6), is likely to be critical here. In both apolipoprotein E and antithrombin III, a heparin-binding motif is formed from similarly conserved basic amino acids, which are spaced about 23 Å apart along β-strands (Table 3). This is consistent with that predicted for efficient binding to a pentasaccharide sequence(22Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thought to be the minimal functional unit of heparin(24Sinay P. Jacquinet J.-C. Petitou M. Duchchaussoy P. Lederman I. Choay J. Torri G. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 132: C5-C9Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The conservation of the consensus heparin-binding motif stands in contrast to the poor conservation of domain five as a whole(25Erickson H.P. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1994; 2: 9-19PubMed Google Scholar), providing further evidence for a likely functional importance. However, other basic residues may also be involved in heparin binding. Inspection of the TNfn5 model reveals that other pairs of conserved basic amino acids lie within a radius of 20-23 Å on the major face of TNfn5. In particular Arg-985 and Arg-987 on the C-strand are possible candidates in combination with Lys-1034 and Lys-1039, respectively. Which combination of amino acids are involved in binding to heparin can now be studied using site-directed mutagenesis or by x-ray diffraction methods should crystallization of the fusion protein-glycosaminoglycan complex prove to be possible.Tabled 1 Presumably the correct conformation of the binding region is critical for the specificity of interaction with glycosaminoglycan chains(22Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An advantage of fusion proteins compared with peptides is that a correct folding of the domains should lead to the binding site being presented to the glycosaminoglycan in a close to native form. With this in mind, the strategy for preparation of the fusion proteins was chosen to maximize the likelihood of producing native proteins that are correctly folded and soluble under nondenaturing conditions. To this end, the constructs begin 4-5 amino acids amino- and carboxyl-terminal outside the theoretical domains. The length of the extraneous sequence at the amino termini (polyhistidine tail for purification and factor Xa cleavage site) was kept to a minimum to reduce the influence on folding of the type III homology domains. This approach appears to be successful, as the fusion proteins were released in soluble form from the Escherichia coli merely by sonification in isotonic buffer. A further indication of the native structure comes from the ready cleavage by factor Xa. Incorrect folding of fusion proteins would lead to the factor Xa recognition sequence being buried, which then only becomes exposed to the proteinase after denaturation/renaturation cycles. Both our fusion proteins 2P. Weber and L. Vaughan, unpublished observations. and those produced by a similar protocol (14Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) can be crystallized for structural analysis. This further strengthens the case for native folding. The proposed heparin-binding site is likely to be available in the intact tenascin-C as fusion protein TNfn1-5 from human (14Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and TNfn56 (shown here), both encompassing TNfn5, are active. A number of candidate proteoglycan ligands have been reported for tenascin-C(9Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nephrol. 1994; 107: 80-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, evidence for binding via the glycosaminoglycans has been presented for syndecan (11Salmivirta M. Elenius K. Vainio S. Hofer U.

David G. Zimmermann D.R. Winterhalter K.H. Contrib. Nephrol. 1994; 107: 80-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of modification of the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan and glypican is likely to be tissue-dependent. Whether a particular sequence of charged residues is necessary for optimal binding to TNfn5, such as the heparin pentasaccharide specific for antithrombin or the dermatan sulfate heptasaccharide binding to heparin cofactor(19Kjellen L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar), is the subject of further investigations. The assignment of glycosaminoglycan binding activity to TNfn5 and the availability of the recombinant fragments should stimulate the search for further in vivo proteoglycan ligands and lead to a better understanding of the role of tenascin-C in development and disease. We thank Dr. H. P. Erickson for the donation of fusion protein TNfbg corresponding to the fibrinogen-like domain derived from human tenascin and Dr. R. Chiquet-Ehrismann for providing pCTN230. The calculations to estimate the structure of cTNfn5 was possible through the friendly help and encouragement of Prof. M. Dobler, ETH Zürich."

If left unrepaired, the bypass of AP sites during DNA replication can result in mutations and loss of genetic integrity (Loeb and Preston, 1986). For example, yeast strains deficient in Apn1 (the major AP endonuclease of Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have a substantially elevated frequency of spontaneous mutations (Ramotar et al., 1991). The extra mutations arising in these repair-deficient yeast strains include all classes of single-base pair substitutions, but most dramatically transversions prompted by the loss of purines (Kunz et al., 1994). apurinic/apyrimidinic kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate phosphate-buffered saline upstream factor. Molecular studies of prokaryotic and eukaryotic AP endonucleases have revealed two families of proteins: those related to Escherichia coli endonuclease IV and yeast Apn1, or those related to E. coli exonuclease III and the major human AP endonuclease, Ape (Demple and Harrison, 1994). Both enzyme families are “class II” AP endonucleases, which hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond on the 5′ of AP sites (Levin and Demple, 1990) to allow excision and repair DNA synthesis (Demple and Harrison, 1994). These AP endonucleases also remove 3′-phosphoglycolate esters and 3′-phosphates from oxidative strand breaks (Chen et al., 1991; Demple et al., 1986; Henner et al., 1983; Johnson and Demple, 1988; Winters et al., 1992, 1994). Although E. coli exonuclease III has a robust 3′-repair diesterase function (Demple et al., 1986), this is a minor activity of the homologous human Ape protein (Chen et al., 1991). The cDNA (Demple et al., 1991; Robson and Hickson, 1991; Seki et al., 1992) and the gene (Harrison et al., 1992) encoding the major human AP endonuclease have been isolated. The APE gene has five exons, one untranslated, and four introns, and is contained within a 3-kb segment of DNA located on chromosome 14q at position 11.2-12 (Harrison et al., 1992). The same gene was identified in independent cloning efforts as HAP1 (Robson et al., 1992; Zhao et al., 1992) and as APEX (Akiyama et al., 1994), and assigned to the same chromosomal site. No disease related to DNA repair has been directly linked to this genome locus. However, the importance of this repair enzyme is suggested by the increased sensitivity to H2O2 or alkylating agents of rat glioma cells expressing of an antisense APE transcript (Ono et al., 1994). APE and its protein product were also isolated in a screen for an activity that restores DNA binding activity to oxidized c-Fos and c-Jun proteins in vitro (Xanthoudakis et al., 1992). This “Ref1” activity was also found for a larger, related protein from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Babiychuk et al., 1994). The in vitro Ref1 activity seems to reside in a short segment of Ape outside the region homologous to exonuclease III and independent of the AP endonuclease function (Walker et al., 1993; Xanthoudakis et al., 1994). Hypoxic conditions in colon cancer cells increased APE expression (Yao et al., 1994). Expression of APE is also transcriptionally modulated during regeneration of the epithelium after physical injury. 2L. Harrison, T. Galonopoulos, A. G. Ascione, H. N. Antoniades, and B. Demple, manuscript in preparation. We have therefore attempted to identify the cellular components that regulate expression of the APE gene. The work presented here identifies promoter elements and DNA-binding activities that mediate basal APE expression in cultured cells. HeLa-S3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. K562 and HepG2 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and modified Eagle's medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Treatment of cells was carried out at 37°C in tissue culture flasks for treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), paraquat, or dexamethasone. HeLa cells were grown in roller bottle cultures for treatment with bleomycin sulfate or heat shock. TPA (Life Technologies, Inc.) was dissolved in Me2SO (Sigma) at a concentration of 1.62 mM and stored at −20°C. Bleomycin sulfate (Sigma) was dissolved in double distilled water at 5 mg/ml and stored at −20°C. Paraquat (methyl viologen; Sigma) was prepared in double distilled water as a 50 mM stock and used immediately. Dexamethasone was prepared at 20 μg/ml in 2% (v/v) ethanol in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Total cellular RNA was isolated using a procedure described by Chomczynski and Sacchi(1987). For Northern blot analysis, 10 μg of RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 M formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim) by capillary action and incubated at 42°C with 32P-labeled, heat-denatured APE cDNA, according to standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989). To determine the level of Ape activity, cells were harvested after washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and extracts prepared according to Chen et al.(1991). After treatment of HeLa cells with bleomycin sulfate or heat shock, S100 extracts were used to partially purify Ape using DE52 and Bio-Rex 70 chromatography, as described previously (Chen et al., 1991). Assays for 3′-repair diesterase were carried out according to Chen et al.(1990). To identify the transcriptional start site for APE, an oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′ portion of the first exon (5′-CGAGATCTGCCCTCCAGCCAATT-3′; Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA) was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Sambrook et al., 1989). The kinase was heatinactivated at 90°C for 2 min and the end-labeled primer stored at −20°C until required. For primer extension reactions, 5 μg of total RNA and 12.5 pmol of end-labeled primer were mixed and denatured by heating to 70°C for 10 min in a final volume of 12.5 μl. Samples were placed on ice for 1 min before resuspension in reaction buffer for avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), or Superscript II from Life Technologies, Inc. The samples were warmed to 42°C for 2 min, and 1 μl of reverse transcriptase was added to the mixture. Synthesis of cDNA was performed at 42°C for 30 min, and the samples were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Plasmid pLHBS1 (Harrison et al., 1992) was digested with HindIII, and the 4.1-kb APE promoter fragment (Fig. 1B) ligated into the HindIII site of pCATBASIC (Promega) in both orientations to produce plasmids pCB1 (antisense) and pCB2 (sense). Plasmid pAPE2 (Harrison et al., 1992) was digested with SmaI and the 5.4-kb human genomic fragment containing the APE gene ligated into the SmaI site of pBluescript-SK to produce pLHBS3. After digestion of pLHBS3 with SmaI and NruI, a 2-kb APE promoter fragment was isolated and ligated into the SalI site of pCATBASIC to produce pCB9. Digestion of pCB9 with SphI and SpeI and re-ligation removed a 1-kb fragment to produce pCB10. Digestion of pCB9 with PstI and re-ligation removed a 1.5-kb fragment to produce pCB11. Plasmid pCB9 was digested with SphI, together with DraIII, BssHII, or AvaI to produce pCB18, pCB19, and pCB23, respectively. To produce pCB21, pCB9 was digested with HindIII to remove 1.95 kb of the upstream region of APE and re-ligated. Digestion of pCB11 with HindIII and PstI allowed the isolation of a 500-bp fragment that was then ligated into the SalI site of pCATBASIC to produce pCB22. To produce pCB26, pCB27, pCB29, and pCB30, pCB22 was digested with SacII, digested with Bal-31 nuclease for 1-1.5 min and re-ligated. pCB15 was isolated following AvaI digestion of pCB10 to remove a 184-bp segment of the APE promoter, and re-ligation. Plasmid pCB22 was digested with DraIII together with BssHII or BanII to produce pCB33 and pCB34, respectively. Plasmid pCB20 was produced by the removal of a 43-bp fragment from pCB11 by digestion with BssHII and BanII. All the plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The amounts of DNA used for transfection corresponded to the number of molecules in 15 μg of pCB1 or pCB2. The total amount of test plasmid DNA in each transfection was made up to 15 μg by the addition of pCATBASIC DNA and then mixed with 10 μg of pSVβgal (Promega) in 200 μl of PBS. 5 × 106 HeLa-S3 cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in the DNA solution. The cells were electroporated at 240 V, 200 ohms, and 960 microfarads, resuspended in 30 ml of DMEM and 10% bovine calf serum, and placed in two 100-mm Petri dishes. After 48 h at 37°C, the cells were harvested, resuspended in 200 μl of 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 8), and extracted by three freeze-thaw cycles. After centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm and 4°C, the cell-free extracts were stored at −80°C. β-Galactosidase assays were carried out according to Sambrook et al.(1989). The extracts were then heated at 60°C for 10 min to inactivate mammalian acetylases and centrifuged at 4°C. The resulting supernatants were assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity (Promega Technical Bulletin 084). Digestion of pCB18 or pCB19 with HindIII released APE promoter fragments of 208 and 165 bp, respectively, while AvaI digestion of pCB11 or pCB20 produced fragments of 191 and 148 bp, respectively. The isolated fragments were end-labeled by incubation with Klenow DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), 167 μM each of unlabeled dNTPs, and 50 μCi of [α-32P]dGTP or [α-32P]dCTP at room temperature for 15 min. End-labeled DNA (0.5-4 fmol) was incubated with HeLa nuclear extract (prepared according to Dignam et al., 1983) or with 50-150 ng of purified recombinant human Sp1 protein (Promega) in 10 μl of binding buffer (4% glycerol (v/v), 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) for 20 min at room temperature. For reactions with purified Sp1, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin (molecular biology grade; Boehringer Mannheim) was added to the binding reaction. In some cases a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide, containing a consensus Sp1 recognition site, was incubated with the protein for 5 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the labeled probe. Where indicated, polyclonal antiserum against the USF transcription factor (a generous gift from Dr. M. Sawadogo, Houston, TX) 3M. Sawadogo, personal communication. was added after 5 min to a final dilution of 10−3 to 10−4 and the incubation continued for another 15 min. After electrophoresis at 100 V in a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (Sambrook et al., 1989) and drying, the gels were autoradiographed. Plasmid pCB29 was digested with AvaI and end-labeled as for the protein binding probes. The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in HaeII reaction buffer, and digested with HaeII. After polyacrylamide electrophoresis, the gel containing the end-labeled 239-bp fragment was incubated in 0.5 ml of elution buffer (0.5 M ammonium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) for ∼12 h. The DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 30 μl 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. End-labeled probe (∼4 fmol) was incubated with 0-30 μg of HeLa nuclear extract or 0-50 ng of recombinant human Sp1 protein, in 10-μl binding reactions (poly(dI-dC) omitted from Sp1 reactions). After 20 min at room temperature, 40 μl of binding buffer and 50 μl of 5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2 were added. RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) was diluted in cold 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) to 0.05 units/μl, and 1-3 μl added to the reaction. After 75 s, 90 μl of stop solution (200 mM NaCl, 30 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA) was added. Protein was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and the DNA precipitated with ethanol. After washing with 70% ethanol and drying, the DNA pellet was resuspended in 4 μl of loading solution (0.1 M NaOH:formamide (1:2, v/v), 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated to 95°C for 2 min, and subjected to electrophoresis in a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. Significant regulation of the APE gene in response to DNA-damaging agents has not been reported. In our hands, the amount of Ape protein or APE mRNA was not altered after treatment of HeLa cells with various DNA damaging agents: bleomycin sulfate, paraquat (a free radical generator), or heat shock (summarized in Table 1). However, our own recent work indicates possible transcriptional regulation of APE during epithelial wound healing,2 and the recently reported hypoxic response of APE (Yao et al., 1994) shows that APE transcription is regulated under some circumstances. We therefore analyzed the functional elements of the APE promoter.Table I Open table in a new tab Analysis of the 2-kb region upstream of APE (data not shown) for possible regulatory sequences (using the GenBank transcription factor data base) revealed several potential recognition sites for transcription factors within the 600 bp upstream of the start point of APE cDNA (GenBank accession no. M99703). These sites included potential binding sequences for Sp1, glucocorticord receptor, c-Myc-like proteins (Faisst and Meyer, 1992) such as upstream factor (USF; Sawadogo et al., 1988; Gregor et al., 1990), and AP1 (Fig. 1). In order to determine whether the AP1 or glucocorticoid receptor binding sites were biologically functional in the APE promoter, K562 or HeLa cells were treated with a phorbol ester (TPA) or dexamethasone. Although Northern analyses demonstrated strong induction of the 2.4-kb c-Fos mRNA after a 6-h TPA treatment, the level of the 1.5-kb APE message was not detectably altered during a 24-h exposure to TPA (Table 1). The APE mRNA also did not vary significantly following dexamethasone treatment (Table 1). Despite the response of APE to hypoxic conditions, incubation of K562 cells with the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide (1.2% final concentration) did not change APE transcription (Table 1). For understanding the significance of the transcription factor binding sites, the transcriptional start site of APE was determined. Total RNA was isolated from three different cell types: K562 myeloid leukemic cells, HepG2 derived from hepatoma cells, and HeLa cells derived from a cervical carcinoma, and analyzed by primer extension. Although multiple start sites were found in all the cell types, three major start sites were identified consistently. These sites were clustered within a 7-bp region, ∼130 bp downstream of the putative CCAAT box in all three cell types (Fig. 2). Such clusters of multiple start sites are common for genes lacking a TATA box (e.g. phenylalanine hydroxylase, Konecki et al.(1992); cystic fibrosis gene, Yoshimura et al.(1991); macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor gene, Yue et al.(1993)). The transcriptional start sites reported for the human lymphoblastoid cell line WIL2-NS (Zhao et al., 1992) and for HeLa cells (Robson et al., 1992), located approximately 75 bp upstream of the sites observed here, were not detected in our experiments. To identify functional regions of the APE promoter, a series of DNA fragments upstream of the APE coding region was ligated into pCATBASIC, which contains the reporter gene encoding CAT. The resulting series of reporter plasmids was analyzed in transient transfection experiments in HeLa cells. Transfection of pCATBASIC alone resulted in negligible CAT activity in the cell extracts. A 500-bp insert (in pCB22) had equivalent basal promoter activity to a 4-kb insert (in pCB2, Fig. 3A). Ligation of the 4-kb insert in the reverse orientation (pCB1) or deletion of 775 bp 5′ to the transcriptional start site (pCB17) resulted in negligible CAT activity. No significant difference was detected between pCB22 and pCB11 (the latter plasmid containing a putative recognition sequence for AP1), which suggests that the segment downstream of the transcription start sites (+65 to +118) is not necessary for basal promoter activity.Figure 3:Reporter gene constructs for the APE promoter. Individual plasmids (see text for construction) were transfected into HeLa cells together with pSVβgal. After 48 h cells were harvested, extracted and assayed for β-galactosidase and CAT activities. The ratio of CAT activity to β-galactosidase was calculated and is expressed as a percentage of the ratio obtained for pCB22 in the same experiment. Each plasmid was transfected at least four independent times, using two different passages of HeLa cells. Symbols are as for Fig. 1. A, activity of promoter segments of 0.5-4.1 kb. B, activity of promoter segments deleted from −462 to −138. C, activity of promoter segments deleted from −138 to +65. D, effect of internal deletions on APE promoter activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Deletion of the region between −462 and −412, which contains a putative Sp1 recognition site, also did not alter basal promoter activity (Fig. 3B). In order to detect a significant decrease in basal promoter activity, it was necessary to delete the 5′ terminus of the genomic insert to −138 (in pCB18), which expressed approximately half the CAT activity of pCB22 (Fig. 3B). The end point in pCB18 lies only 10 bp upstream of the CCAAT box. The region between −173 (pCB29) and −138 (pCB18) contains two overlapping Sp1 consensus recognition sequences (Fig. 4A) that may contribute to basal expression. As this paper was being finished, a report (Akiyama et al., 1994) appeared that confirms the results of Fig. 3(A and B). The deletion experiments showed that the basal APE promoter for HeLa cells is contained in a relatively small region of DNA. Therefore additional reporter gene constructs were prepared to determine the minimum region required for full promoter activity of APE. Little or no CAT activity was expressed with inserts of 53 or 87 bp of the APE upstream region (in pCB21 and pCB23, respectively, Fig. 3C). However, a fragment lacking the putative CCAAT box (−95 to +118) conferred ∼80% promoter activity relative to pCB22 in four independent transfections (Fig. 3C). Addition of the CCAAT box segment to pCB19 actually decreased the promoter activity consistently 2-fold. It seemed possible that the residual fragment in pCB19 might not accurately represent the APE promoter. Therefore, various internal deletions of pCB22, pCB11 and pCB10 were prepared (Fig. 3D). All promoter activity was lost by deleting a segment between −210 and −25 (yielding pCB15), which contains the putative CCAAT box, the Sp1 site and a 64-bp segment that conferred promoter activity in pCB19 (Fig. 3C). Promoter activity was reduced 11-fold by deleting the CCAAT box and the Sp1 site (yielding pCB33). When another 43 bp were deleted from pCB22 (to generate pCB34), negligible amounts of CAT activity were expressed (Fig. 3D). This confirmed that promoter activity could be conferred by the region −98 to −55 within a larger genomic fragment. To test the role of this sequence in the context of the CCAAT box, plasmid pCB20 was constructed (Fig. 3D). Six independent transfections of each of the constructs shown in Fig. 3D, using three different passages of HeLa cells, consistently showed pCB20 to express higher levels of CAT activity than pCB22. These results can be contrasted with those for pCB18 and pCB19, which indicated significant promoter activity for the region downstream of the CCAAT box (Fig. 3C). The functional significance of the putative protein binding sites in the APE promoter was assessed in a series of protein-DNA binding experiments. For this purpose four different APE promoter fragments (Fig. 4) were isolated by restriction digestion of plasmids pCB19 (probe I), pCB18 (probe II), pCB11 (probe III), and pCB20 (probe IV). After labeling and incubation with HeLa nuclear extracts, gel electrophoresis resolved distinct protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 5A). Probe I yielded two complexes, one of which electrophoresed with a similar mobility to the single complex observed with probe II (Fig. 5). Probes I and II both contained the 43-bp region that conferred promoter activity in pCB19 (Fig. 3C), but probe II contained the CCAAT box in addition (Fig. 4). Probes III and IV also yielded single protein-DNA complexes that contained a significant fraction of the total DNA at the highest protein levels (Fig. 5A). The complexes with probes II, III, and IV were not eliminated by increasing in the binding reactions the concentration of poly(dI-dC) up to 200 μg/ml (Fig. 5B). In contrast, such competition was effective in reducing the amounts of protein-DNA complexes containing probe I (Fig. 5B). In order to determine the contribution of USF and of Sp1 protein to the formation of these complexes, additional binding studies were carried out. The 64-bp region that conferred promoter activity in pCB19 (absent from pCB23; Fig. 3C), contains two consensus binding sites (CACGTG) for c-Myc-like proteins (Prendergast and Ziff, 1991), such as the human upstream factor (USF, Gregor et al., 1990; Fig. 4A). One site (TCACGTGA) is the sequence recognized by the major late transcription factor of adenovirus, of which USF is the human counterpart (Sawadogo et al., 1985; Carthew et al., 1985; Miyamoto et al., 1985). To test for the binding of this protein, we employed specific antibodies.3 Labeled probe I was incubated with HeLa nuclear extract and polyclonal anti-USF antiserum added to the reactions. Of the two complexes formed, one (the upper complex; Fig. 6A) decreased in intensity with increasing antibody concentration as a series of complexes of slower mobility appeared (Fig. 6A). Neither the second complex formed with probe I nor those formed with probes III and IV were affected by the anti-USF antibody (Fig. 6A). Although it is possible that the binding of other proteins to probe III may have masked the crucial epitopes in bound USF, the formation of a similar mobility complex with probe IV (lacking the USF site; Fig. 4) argues against this interpretation. Incubation of pure Sp1 protein with probe III yielded two complexes, one of which was less intense and had slower mobility (Fig. 6B). Since this Sp1 site consists of two overlapping recognition sites, the upper band in Fig. 6B may correspond to the binding of a second Sp1 molecule to this second site. The binding by pure Sp1 was competed by a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing the Sp1 consensus sequence; a ∼20-fold molar excess diminished probe III binding significantly, and a ∼2000-fold excess eliminated it (Fig. 6B). Such competition was not observed for binding of HeLa nuclear extract protein(s) to probe III, although those extracts contain Sp1 that binds the synthetic oligonucleotide (data not shown). Pure Sp1 formed a distinct footprint spanning the base pairs −169 to −148 in the APE promoter, as revealed in DNase protection experiments (Fig. 7A; for sequence see Fig. 4A). However, such a distinct footprint was not observed after incubation with HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 7B), which instead had strongest binding activity for a ∼40-bp region containing the CCAAT box (Fig. 7B; for the sequence, see Fig. 4A). A partial protection of the USF site and adjacent 3′ sequences may also occur (Fig. 7B). Addition of 50 ng of Sp1 protein to 30 μg of nuclear extract still did not result in a distinct Sp1 footprint (data not shown). Thus, although both USF and Sp1 are available in our nuclear extract, and the respective DNA sites are capable of binding these proteins, the binding of one or more other nuclear proteins over the CCAAT box region prevents USF and Sp1 from efficiently binding their DNA targets. The APE gene product is expressed constitutively at relatively high levels in the nuclei (Demple et al., 1991) of transformed cells such as HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, or HPB-ALL T-lymphoblasts (∼7 × 106 molecules/cell; Chen et al., 1991). Conversely, attempts to modulate the expression of this probable DNA repair protein by DNA-damaging treatments have yielded consistently negative results (Table 1). Such experiments have not been reported for untransformed human fibroblasts, in which the Ape levels are 10-20 times lower (Chen et al., 1991). A rather small upstream region (∼140 bp) of APE seems to be required for the high basal expression in HeLa cells, as shown here by deletion analysis of the APE promoter linked to a reporter gene. Within this basal APE promoter lie several potential regulatory sites. Surprisingly, deletion of the putative CCAAT box of the APE promoter failed to obliterate transcriptional activity (in pCB19 and pCB33). This expression could result from promoter elements that remain silent when the CCAAT box is present, as may be the case with the USF-binding site (see below). It is not known whether the altered constructs direct the use of the same transcriptional starts employed for basal expression by the intact APE promoter in HeLa, HepG2, or K562 cells. Like many TATA-less genes (Konecki, et al., 1992; Yoshimura et al., 1991; Yue at al., 1993), APE displays multiple transcription start sites, with those identified here clustered ∼130 bp upstream from the first splice junction (Harrison et al., 1992). Additional initiation sites for APE mRNA in HeLa cells were seen in some of our experiments (data not shown), and still other sites have been reported from other laboratories (Zhao et al., 1992; Robson et al., 1992; Akiyama et al., 1994). It remains to be seen whether these same sites are used during the induction of APE transcription in hypoxic cells (Yao et al., 1994) or possibly during epithelial regeneration.2 Potential binding sites for transcription factors are present in the APE promoter (e.g. Sp1 and USF) and within the structural gene (e.g. AP1; Fig. 1). The AP1 site in exon 1 seems not to exert an effect in K562 cells, as suggested by the lack of response of APE transcription to TPA (Table 1). Similarly expression of the rat homolog of APE was not altered with c-fos induction in the hypothalamus after light exposure (Rivkees and Kelley, 1994). Sp1 sites located −420 bp and −168 bp 5′ of APE may make modest contributions to the basal expression, although at least one of these sites was evidently not strongly bound by Sp1 in HeLa nuclear extracts, even though the site ∼30 bp 5′ of the CCAAT box is bound by pure Sp1 protein in vitro. The nuclear extracts also contained functional USF protein that could bind a cognate site in a DNA fragment lacking the CCAAT box, as judged by the “supershifting” effect of polyclonal anti-USF antiserum. Some binding was detected overlapping the USF site (∼40 bp 3′ to the CCAAT box) with HeLa nuclear extracts and a hypersensitive site is situated at −69, just 3′ to this region (Fig. 7B, and data not shown), but the lack of “supershifting” by anti-USF antiserum suggests that this binding does not involve USF itself. The CCAAT-containing fragments exhibited strong and specific binding of nuclear protein(s) and the protection of a 40-bp region, including the CCAAT box itself. It seems possible that the latter binding represents recognition by basal transcription factor(s) in HeLa extracts, such as CP1 (Chodosh et al., 1988), NF-Y (Dorn et al., 1987), and CP2 or NF-1 (Chodosh et al., 1988). If so, such binding evidently precludes interaction with either USF or Sp1 at their nearby sites. In the absence of the CCAAT box, USF can bind its site and may contribute to the promoter activity of pCB19 and pCB33 (Sawadogo and Roeder, 1985; Sawadogo et al., 1988; Roy et al., 1991). The APE promoter bears some features in common with so-called “housekeeping” genes: lack of a TATA box, multiple transcription start sites (Konecki et al., 1992; Yoshimura et al., 1991; Yue et al., 1993), and similar expression in a variety of tissues 4L. Hughes-Davies, T. Galonopoulos, L. Harrison, M. Maxwell, H. N. Antoniades, and B. Demple, submitted for publication. (Akiyama et al., 1994). Such widespread expression suggests the action of transcription factors present in many cell types and active under a variety of conditions. Nonetheless, APE transcription does increase in response to hypoxia in cultured carcinoma cells (Yao et al., 1994) and may be modulated during epithelial wound healing.2 It will be of interest to determine whether and how the protein binding sites observed here and the functional regions of the APE promoter might be employed during these regulated responses. We thank members of our laboratory for helpful discussions, and S. Phelan and Dr. K. Call for RNA samples from TPA-treated K562 cells. We are grateful to Dr. M. Sawadogo for the generous gift of anti-USF antiserum."

In both instances, it is believed that the effects of these agents are related to a sensitization of the IP3R to endogenous levels of IP3.

The exact mode of action of thiol reagents on the IP3R has not been delineated, and it is not known if all of these agents have a common site of action. We have attempted to address this question by comparing the effects of several different thiol-reactive agents on [3H]IP3 binding and IP3-gated channel activity. In the present study we report that mersalyl and thimerosal, two structurally related organomercurial thiol-reactive agents, have different effects on the function of the isoforms of the IP3R in brain and liver. The data suggest the presence of several distinct reactive thiols that are important in regulating IP3R function. Mersalyl, thimerosal, N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercurophenylsulfonate were from Sigma. GSSG was from Boehringer Mannheim. Unlabeled IP3 was from Calbiochem. [3H]IP3 was from DuPont NEN. Isolated hepatocytes were prepared by collagenase digestion of perfused rat livers and were washed and stored on ice at 20-30 mg of protein/ml in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hank's buffer as described previously(25Joseph S.K. Coll K.E. Thomas A.P. Rubin R. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12508-12515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For incubation with thiol-reactive agents, the cells were centrifuged (150 × g, 15 s) and resuspended in hepatocyte resuspension buffer which contained 120 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-Hepes (pH 7.2), 2 mM HEDTA, 0.1 mM vanadate, 5 mM NaF, 4 nM okadaic acid, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. The cells were permeabilized by addition of 40 μg of saponin/mg of cell protein. Complete permeabilization (<5 min) was monitored by trypan blue staining. The cell concentration was adjusted to 5 mg of protein/ml and 0.8 ml were incubated for 5 min at 4°C with 0.8 ml of label medium containing 120 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 nM [3H]IP3 (DuPont NEN; 20 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of thiol-reactive agents. Triplicate 0.5-ml samples were vacuum filtered through glass-fiber filters (Gelman A/E), and the filters were washed twice with 5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The filters were counted in scintillation fluid (Budget Solve, RPI Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). Permeabilized hepatocytes were solubilized at 4°C for 30 min in hepatocyte solubilization buffer, which contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and leupeptin. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 25,000 × g. Binding to hepatocyte extracts was measured using a polyethylene glycol precipitation assay as described(26Joseph S.K. Ryan S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23059-23065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intact hepatocytes (4 mg of protein/ml) were loaded with 5 μM Fura-2/AM for 35 min at 37°C in a buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM Na+/Hepes, 120 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 5 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 2% bovine serum albumin. After loading, the cells were washed and stored at 4°C in Na+/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris/Hepes, 1 mM KH2PO4, and 0.2 mM MgCl2. Prior to use, the cells were washed once in Na+/Hepes buffer containing 100 μM EGTA. The cells were then permeabilized at 4°C in a buffer (pH 7.2) containing 120 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/Hepes, 1 mM KH2PO4, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 40 μg/ml digitonin, 5 μM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 5 μM oligomycin, 1 μM rotenone, 2 mM ATP, 5 mM phosphocreatine, 0.5 unit/ml creatine kinase, 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin, and 2 μM thapsigargin. Incubations were performed in the cuvette of a fluorimeter (Photon Technology Deltascan) maintained at 4°C with continuous stirring. The excitation wavelength was 360 nM with emission at 510 nM. The quenching of the Fura-2 trapped into the organelles was monitored after addition of 40 μM MnCl2. WB cells, a clonal cell line derived from rat liver(27Tsao M.S. Smith J.D. Nelson K.G. Grisham J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 154: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), were cultured in Richter's modified MEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to confluence and were used between passages 25 and 30. The plates were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 4°C for 20 min in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.2), 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin. The cells from all the plates were scraped, pooled, and homogenized 15 times in a Dounce homogenizer with a tight fitting pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100 × g for 1 min to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The crude WB cell membrane fraction was resuspended in 320 mM sucrose, 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM EDTA and stored at −80°C. Microsomal membranes were prepared from rat cerebellum homogenates by differential centrifugation as described previously (28Joseph S.K. Rice H.L. Williamson J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and stored at −80°C in the same buffer as WB cell membranes. WB cell membranes or rat cerebellum microsomal membranes were incubated at 1 mg of protein/ml in buffer A containing 120 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 mM EDTA in the presence and absence of 200 μM mersalyl for 10 min on ice. The membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in buffer A at 1 mg of protein/ml. Proteinase K was added at a ratio of 10 μg/mg membrane protein and incubated at room temperature for different periods of time. The reaction was terminated by addition of 3 mM PMSF and the membranes reisolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The membrane pellet was solubilized and denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose sheets were immunoblotted with antibodies raised to amino acids 401-414 in the N-terminal domain (KEEK-Ab), or to the C-terminal 19 amino acids of the rat type-I IP3R. The recognition properties of the antibodies and conditions for immunoblotting have been previously described(29Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Nature. 1989; 342: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 30Joseph S. Samanta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6477-6486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5673-5679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.) The effect of several thiol-reactive agents on [3H]IP3 binding to saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes is shown in Fig. 1. The incubation period with thiol reagent and [3H]IP3 was 5 min and was performed at 4°C in a Mg2+-free medium to minimize hydrolysis of [3H]IP3. Under these conditions, a marked stimulation (4-5-fold) of [3H]IP3 binding was observed in the presence of mersalyl, an organomercurial thiol-reactive agent. Two structurally related molecules, thimerosal and p-chloromercurophenylsulfonate, also stimulated [3H]IP3 binding, but the degree of stimulation was much lower than observed with mersalyl. Increasing the concentration or incubation time did not enhance the stimulatory effect of thimerosal (data not shown). Oxidized glutathione or the thiol-alkylating agent, N-ethylmaleimide, were without effect on [3H]IP3 binding at 4°C. Ca2+ has been shown to stimulate IP3 binding to the hepatic IP3R(32Mauger J.P. Claret M. Pietri F. Hilly M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8821-8826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Ca2+ mediates a conversion of receptors from a low affinity (active) form to a high affinity (inactive) form(33Pietri F. Hilly M. Mauger J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17478-17485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rouxel F.P. Hilly M. Mauger J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20017-20023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hilly et al.(20Hilly M. Pietri-Rouxel F. Coquil J.F. Guy M. Mauger J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16488-16494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown previously that the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ and thimerosal on IP3 binding to permeabilized hepatocytes are not additive. Fig. 2A demonstrates that the stimulation of [3H]IP3 binding by mersalyl is dose-dependent with maximal effects being observed at 100-200 μM mersalyl. Ca2+ (buffered at 10 μM concentration) stimulated IP3 binding to a lesser extent than a maximal concentration of mersalyl and the effect of both agents were not additive. Scatchard analysis of the binding data (Fig. 2B), indicated that mersalyl stimulated [3H]IP3 binding by increasing the affinity of the IP3 receptor without altering the maximal number of binding sites. In three experiments the respective apparent Kd and Bmax values were 27 ± 3 nM and 125 ± 6 fmol/mg protein under control conditions, and 4.7 ± 0.3 nM and 98 ± 3 fmol/mg protein in the presence of 100 μM mersalyl. The effect of mersalyl is qualitatively similar to the effect of Ca2+ on the binding affinity of the hepatic IP3R(33Pietri F. Hilly M. Mauger J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17478-17485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the stimulatory effect of Ca2+ on IP3 binding in permeabilized hepatocytes is lost after detergent solubilization of membranes(26Joseph S.K. Ryan S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23059-23065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiment in Fig. 3 was carried out to determine if this was also the case with mersalyl. Permeabilized hepatocytes were treated with mersalyl and then washed. The washed mersalyl-treated hepatocytes retained an enhanced IP3 binding activity (Fig. 3A). These hepatocytes were then solubilized with Triton X-100, and binding activity was measured in extracts exposed to increasing concentrations of mersalyl (Fig. 3B). The addition of mersalyl to Triton X-100 extracts prepared from control hepatocytes had no significant effect on [3H]IP3 binding. Binding activity in Triton X-100 extracts of mersalyl pretreated membranes was only slightly higher than control extracts and the further addition of mersalyl produced a dose-dependent inhibition of binding. These results indicate that, as with Ca2+, the stimulatory effect of mersalyl cannot be observed after detergent solubilization. The reason why mersalyl pretreatment of membranes causes mersalyl to inhibit [3H]IP3 binding in detergent extracts is presently not clear. A possibility is that mersalyl binding to the receptor in membranes alters the conformation of the protein (see below) in a manner that exposes an additional mersalyl-reactive thiol group after detergent solubilization that is inhibitory to ligand binding. We have examined the functional effect of mersalyl and thimerosal on IP3-mediated Ca2+ channel function in Figure 4:, Figure 5:. In order to avoid the known inhibitory effect of thiol-reactive agents on Ca2+-ATPase (16Bootman M.D. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25113-25119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sayers L.G. Brown G.R. Michell R.H. Michelangeli F. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 35Missiaen L. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we have utilized an assay method based on the ability of Mn2+ to traverse the IP3-activated Ca2+ channel in a retrograde manner and quench the fluorescence of Fura-2 compartmentalized in intracellular stores(36Renard-Rooney D.C. Hajnoczky G. Seitz M.B. Schneider T. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23601-23610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All the fluorescence measurements were carried out at 4°C in order to permit comparison to the ligand binding data. The addition of Mn2+ to permeabilized Fura-2-loaded hepatocytes, pretreated with the Ca2+ pump inhibitor thapsigargin, produced a rapid quenching of cytosolic Fura-2 released from the permeabilized cells. The subsequent addition of 1 μM IP3 (a maximal dose) produced an additional quench corresponding to the entry of Mn2+ into the IP3-sensitive compartment (Fig. 4). Further entry of Mn2+ into the IP3-insensitive compartment could be observed after addition of ionomycin. When the permeabilized hepatocytes were pretreated with mersalyl a complete inhibition of the IP3-mediated quench was observed (Fig. 4). The total pool size of the intracellular stores was not altered by mersalyl pretreatment. Greater than 95% inhibition of IP3-mediated Mn2+ quench was observed with IP3 concentrations in the range 0.1-10 μM (data not shown). The inhibitory effects of mersalyl were also noted at 37°C, although the effects were less marked than at 4°C. 2The initial rate of IP3 (1 μM) induced Fura-2 quenching at 37°C expressed as percentage of total fluorescence/s was 2.02 ± 0.35 in control cells and 0.35 ± 0.07 in mersalyl-treated cells. Under these conditions, the total quench mediated by IP3 expressed as a percentage of the ionomycin quenchable pool was 37.5 ± 2.7% in control cells and 19.4 ± 3.4% in mersalyl-treated cells (mean ± S.E., n = 4). Previous studies have shown that the potentiating effect of thimerosal on IP3-induced Ca2+ release is seen only at suboptimal IP3 concentrations(22Sayers L.G. Brown G.R. Michell R.H. Michelangeli F. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Parys J. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 424: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, thimerosal at 4°C markedly potentiated the Mn2+ quench mediated by 10 nM IP3 (Fig. 5, lower panel) with a much smaller effect on the responsiveness to 500 nM IP3 (Fig. 5, upper panel).Figure 5:The effect of thimerosal on IP3-mediated Mn2+ quenching of compartmentalized Fura-2 in intracellular stores. Hepatocytes were loaded with Fura-2/AM, washed, and permeabilized at 4°C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The permeabilized cells were pretreated with thimerosal (100 μM) for 5 min before addition of Mn2+. All recordings were made at 4°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A possible mechanism of action of mersalyl is that binding of this agent to a free thiol group on the IP3R alters the conformation of the protein, resulting in a form of the receptor with an inactive Ca2+ channel and a high affinity for ligand. To try to detect a conformational change in the protein in its native membrane environment, we have looked for changes in the pattern of immunoreactive fragments generated after addition of proteases. Such experiments are facilitated by using membranes that contain higher levels of immunoreactive IP3R than found in hepatocytes. Fig. 6 shows the effect of mersalyl on [3H]IP3 binding to membranes prepared from WB rat liver epithelial cells and rat cerebellum. Both membranes are known to contain relatively high levels of immunoreactive type-I IP3R(31Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5673-5679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Only the receptor in WB membranes showed a stimulation of [3H]IP3 binding by mersalyl, and these were used in subsequent studies. Fig. 7A shows the pattern of fragments observed after proteinase K digestion of WB cell membranes, as visualized with an antibody raised to amino acids 401-414 in the N-terminal region of the type-I IP3R. In addition to several intermediate digestion products, a prominent proteolytic product of 37.1 ± 2.2 kDa (n = 4) was formed with progressive proteinase K digestion under control conditions. This band was not observed after proteinase K treatment of WB cell membranes that had first been treated with mersalyl and reisolated by centrifugation. The protease fragmentation pattern of cerebellum IP3R was substantially different from that observed with WB cell membranes, although a 35.4 ± 0.4 kDa (n = 3) polypeptide was also formed in cerebellar membranes (Fig. 7B). In agreement with the results of binding data, pretreatment of cerebellum membranes with mersalyl had no effect on the protease cleavage pattern. Fig. 8A shows that thimerosal, at an equivalent concentration, does not mimic the action of mersalyl. The effect of mersalyl on the protease cleavage pattern of the WB IP3R was completely prevented by inclusion of an excess of dithiothreitol. The 37-kDa immunoreactive fragment in both WB cell and cerebellum was associated with the membrane fraction. This reflected a peripheral association with the membrane, since we were able to remove this fragment by washing the membranes with 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 11.0 (data not shown). The supernatant fractions obtained after proteinase K digestion of control and mersalyl-treated WB membranes were analyzed for the presence of the 37-kDa KEEK-reactive fragment (Fig. 8B). The absence of the 37-kDa cleavage product in WB membranes after mersalyl pretreatment was not the result of a selective loss of this fragment into the soluble fraction. The combination of mersalyl and thimerosal together produces a pattern of protease digestion which is the same as obtained with mersalyl alone (Fig. 8C). This observation supports the conclusion that the two sulfydryl reagents interact with different thiol groups. Several recent studies have examined the effect of thimerosal on IP3 binding and IP3-dependent Ca2+ release. Low concentrations of thimerosal were found to potentiate IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from adrenal cortex microsomes(21Poitras M. Bernier S. Servant M. Richard D.E. Boulay G. Guillemette G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24078-24082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), permeabilized hepatocytes(20Hilly M. Pietri-Rouxel F. Coquil J.F. Guy M. Mauger J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16488-16494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cerebellum microsomes (20Hilly M. Pietri-Rouxel F. Coquil J.F. Guy M. Mauger J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16488-16494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sayers L.G. Brown G.R. Michell R.H. Michelangeli F. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and permeabilized A7r5 smooth-muscle cells(23Parys J. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 424: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In adrenal cortex and hepatocytes, the potentiation by thimerosal was accompanied by a large stimulation of IP3 binding reflecting an increased affinity of the IP3R. On the basis of these data, it has been concluded that the high affinity form of the receptor induced by thimerosal is functionally active and is distinct from the high affinity form of the receptor induced by Ca2+, which is functionally less active as a Ca2+ channel(33Pietri F. Hilly M. Mauger J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17478-17485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that the related thiol-reagent, mersalyl, has a marked stimulatory effect on IP3 binding and behaves more like Ca2+, in that it generates a high affinity form of the receptor that is functionally inactive. These studies reinforce the idea that the IP3R can exist in several non-equivalent high affinity states that may have high or low Ca2+ conductance (20Hilly M. Pietri-Rouxel F. Coquil J.F. Guy M. Mauger J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16488-16494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Marshall I.C.B. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13214-13220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that the stimulatory effect of thimerosal on IP3 binding has not been observed in all studies (e.g.(22Sayers L.G. Brown G.R. Michell R.H. Michelangeli F. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and (23Parys J. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 424: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and only a modest stimulation of binding was observed in permeabilized hepatocytes under our assay conditions at 4°C. We attribute this difference to reaction of the sulfydryl reagents with separate thiol groups on the receptor rather than to differences of reactivity with the same thiol group for several reasons. First, incubation of permeabilized hepatocytes at 4°C for longer periods with higher concentrations of thimerosal did not enhance the effect on [3H]IP3 binding. Second, the effects of mersalyl and thimerosal on channel function and protease digestion of the receptor are clearly different. Third, the combination of mersalyl and thimerosal together produces a pattern of protease digestion which is the same as obtained with mersalyl alone (Fig. 8C). Other factors, such as temperature, may modify the reactivity of individual thiol groups. For example, we have found that the effect of thimerosal on ligand binding could be enhanced, and the effect of mersalyl diminished, by preincubating the permeabilized hepatocytes at 37°C with the thiol agents prior to measurement of binding at 4°C. 3D. Renard-Rooney, S. K. Joseph, M. Seitz, and A. P. Thomas, unpublished observations. The elevation of temperature does not, however, qualitatively modify the effect of the sulfydryl agents on channel function (Footnote 2 and data not shown). A temperature-dependent alteration in the accessibility of N-ethylmaleimide-reactive thiol groups on the hepatic IP3R has also been documented previously(39Pruijn F.B. Sibeijn J.P. Bast A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whereas low concentrations of thimerosal stimulate IP3-mediated Ca2+ release, higher concentrations (>10 μM) have been found to inhibit the release process in some systems(22Sayers L.G. Brown G.R. Michell R.H. Michelangeli F. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Parys J. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 424: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In part, this is due to an inhibition of the Ca2+ pump and to an increase in the passive Ca2+ permeability of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane(22Sayers L.G. Brown G.R. Michell R.H. Michelangeli F. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Parys J. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Droogmans G. Casteels R. Pflugers Arch. 1993; 424: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using the Mn2+ quench assay, a biphasic dependence on thimerosal concentrations up to 100 μM was not observed in the present study. Mersalyl stimulates IP3 binding to liver and WB cell membranes but is without effect on cerebellum microsomes. The full spectrum of IP3R isoforms in each of these tissues has not been established unequivocally. However, it is known that the cerebellum contains predominantly type-I IP3R (3Sudhof T.C. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Mignery G.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 40Ross C.A. Danoff S.K. Schell M.J. Snyder S.H. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4265-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and that non-neuronal cells contain an alternative transcript of the type-I isoform that has a 40-amino acid deletion(41Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2951-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 42Nakagawa T. Okano H. Furuichi T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6244-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These “long” and “short” forms of the type-I IP3R have been shown to differ in their regulation by Ca2+ and cAMP-dependent phosphorylation(41Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2951-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that the liver expresses low amounts of type-III IP3R mRNA and much higher amounts of type-I and type-II IP3R mRNA(43De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Bootman M.D. Mertens L. Van Den Bosch L. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21691-21698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the WB cell contains predominantly types I and III IP3R and very little of any other isoform, as judged by the 90% immunodepletion of [3H]IP3 binding sites from WB cell extracts by a combination of type-I and type-III specific antibodies. 4S. K. Joseph, S. Pierson, and A. P. Maranto, unpublished observations. Thus the difference in reactivity toward mersalyl of the hepatocyte/WB cell and cerebellum IP3R could be accounted for by the selective insensitivity of the type-I (long form) to the sulfydryl agent or alternatively, to tissue-specific differences in ancillary sulfydryl reagent-sensitive regulatory proteins. It is somewhat surprising that two such closely related organomercurial agents should have different effects on the hepatic IP3R. Both molecules are anionic and, in the case of mersalyl, known not to penetrate mitochondrial membranes(44Fonyo A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1978; 10: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of mersalyl are believed to be the result of the formation of a mercaptide bond with free thiol groups in a protein(45van Iwaarden P.R. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). With thimerosal, the mercury is already linked to sulfur, and it is therefore possible that reaction with protein thiols may generate mixed disulfides. In studies on the rate of reaction of the free thiols of ovalbumin with several mercaptide forming agents, it was observed that mersalyl was more reactive than other agents such as p-chloromercurobenzoate (46Taketera K. Watanabe T. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 3644-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These variations in reactivity were attributed to differences in the degree of steric hindrance around the reactive mercury in these molecules(46Taketera K. Watanabe T. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 3644-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, differences in the chemistry of reaction and/or accessibility to reactive thiol groups may underlie the distinctive effects of the two agents. The current model of IP3 gating of the Ca2+ channel in the IP3R proposes that ligand binding is associated with a large conformational change in the protein(6Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that mersalyl pretreatment of WB cell membranes effectively eliminates the appearance of a 37-kDa immunoreactive receptor fragment generated by proteinase K cleavage. We interpret these data to indicate that reaction of a thiol group on the receptor induced a conformational change in the protein that exposed the region of the receptor containing the antibody epitope (amino acids 401-414) to cleavage by proteinase K. Two findings suggest that this conformational change is linked to the effect of mersalyl on [3H]IP3 binding. First, mersalyl does not affect [3H]IP3 binding in cerebellum microsomes and also does not alter the formation of any of the proteolytic fragments in this system. Second, thimerosal does not mimic the effect of mersalyl on [3H]IP3 binding or the appearance of 37-kDa proteinase K fragment. The antibody epitope falls within the region thought to be involved in ligand binding(2Mikoshiba K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 86-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, IP3 itself had no effect on the pattern of proteinase K digestion fragments and did not prevent the effect of mersalyl (data not shown). [3H]IP3 binding to Triton X-100 solubilized extracts (Fig. 3B) or heparin-agarose column eluates (data not shown) are not affected by mersalyl (data not shown). Mersalyl may continue to react with thiol groups on the receptor under these conditions and still have no effect on binding, since removal of the protein from its membrane environment may grossly alter regulation of the binding site(26Joseph S.K. Ryan S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23059-23065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present data do not exclude the possibility that mersalyl or other sulfydryl agents interact with ancillary regulatory proteins rather than reacting directly with the receptor. Despite this, it is clear that reaction of specific thiol groups on the receptor, or a regulatory protein, has profound consequences on the function of the IP3 receptor/ion channel. These thiols have varied sensitivity to sulfydryl reagents, and reactivity is also different between different IP3R isoforms. Identification of these functionally important cysteine residues and characterization of their role in ligand binding/ion channel function of the receptor remains a challenging objective."

Transfection of VCAM-1 gene promoter constructs into P19 cells revealed that the VCAM-1 gene is controlled sequentially by negative and positive elements during differentiation. We present evidence that early during differentiation, POU proteins block VCAM-1 gene activity; however, later in differentiation coincident with the appearance of VCAM-1 the pattern of POU proteins changes and the VCAM-1 gene promoter is activated.

Classically, in response to inflammatory cytokines VCAM-1 appears on the surface of endothelial cells, and through interaction with integrin receptors α4β1 and α4β7 on leukocytes it mediates cell-cell interactions that are important for targeting subsets of leukocytes to sites of inflammation (Elices et al., 1990; Rice et al., 1990; Erle et al., 1991; Freedman et al., 1991, Miyake et al., 1991; Scheeren et al., 1991, Shimizu et al., 1991; Ruegg et al., 1992). Recently, we have found that VCAM-1 and α4β1 are also expressed during development where they have a role mediating cell-cell interactions that are important for skeletal myogenesis (Rosen et al., 1992; Sheppard et al., 1994). vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 central nervous system phosphate-buffered saline chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activating transcription factor glial fibrillary protein kilobase(s) base pair(s). Here, we show that VCAM-1 is expressed in the developing brain and spinal cord, again in the absence of α4 integrins. VCAM-1 is confined to the ventricular zone of the central nervous system (CNS), which contains a dividing population of stem cells that will give rise to neurons and glia (Gilbert, 1988). As these neuroepithelial cells differentiate, VCAM-1 is restricted to a subset of the glial population; no expression was detected on the neuronal lineage. Thus, VCAM-1 appears to be a lineage-specific marker of neural differentiation. The glial population on which VCAM-1 persists is known as radial glia. The body of these cells is located in the ventricular zone; however, they send projections across the developing CNS, and differentiating neurons are thought to use these projections as tracts for migration out of the ventricular zone (Rakic, 1972). VCAM-1(-) mice appear to die before it can be determined whether there is normal CNS development. 2M. Labow, personal communication. Therefore, the role of VCAM-1 in the developing CNS is uncertain. Despite the as yet unestablished role of VCAM-1 in the developing CNS, its selective expression on a subset of the glial lineage during CNS differentiation indicates that it could be a useful lineagespecific marker of neural differentiation. A central question in neurobiology is how the different lineages arise from neuroepithelial cells and how their phenotypes are maintained. Studies of mechanisms controlling the pattern of VCAM-1 during neural differentiation could provide insight into how gene expression is controlled as neuroepithelial cells differentiate into radial glia. Previously, we have cloned the VCAM-1 gene promoter and characterized its activity in endothelial and skeletal muscle cells (Iademarco et al., 1992, 1993). In endothelial cells VCAM-1 gene expression is dependent upon inflammatory cytokines for expression. We found that a series of octamers, which bind the POU family of transcription factors (Rosenfeld et al., 1991; Ruvkun and Finney, 1991; Wegner et al., 1993), are negative elements that prevent VCAM-1 gene activity in unstimulated endothelial cells. In response to tumor necrosis factor-α, κB-like sites (Lenardo, 1989; Kieran et al., 1990; Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1991; Schmid et al., 1991; Urban et al., 1991; Perkins et al., 1992; Ryseck et al., 1992; Lernbecher et al. 1993; Wasserman, 1993) in the promoter were activated. These sites overcame the negative effect of the octamers resulting in transcription of the VCAM-1 gene. Interestingly, the VCAM-1 gene κB sites were tissue-specific; they were not active in lymphocytes, where such elements have classically been studied (Iademarco et al., 1992). In skeletal muscle cells we identified an enhancer located between the TATA box and transcriptional initiation site that is responsible for a high level of constitutive VCAM-1 expression in skeletal muscle; this enhancer did not bind nuclear protein from endothelial cells, and it had no activity in transfection assays in endothelial cells (Iademarco et al., 1993). To study VCAM-1 gene expression during neural differentiation, we turned to the embryonic carcinoma cell line, P19, which in response to retinoic acid will differentiate along a neural pathway (Jones-Villeneuve at al., 1982). We show that the pattern of VCAM-1 during P19 cell differentiation resembles that in the differentiating CNS. Transfection of VCAM-1 gene promoter constructs into P19 cells revealed that the gene is controlled sequentially by negative elements and positive elements during differentiation. We identify these elements as octamers and κB sites; however, we show that their pattern of activity in P19 cells is quite distinct from that in endothelial cells. This is the first example that NFκB/rel proteins could have a role in neural differentiation, and we suggest that the combination of POU proteins and NFκB/rel proteins could be important for regulating expression of genes that determine lineage specificity. M/K-1 (Miyake, et al., 1991a; diluted 1:1) and anti-NCAM-110 (Pharmigen; diluted 1:5) are rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies to VCAM-1. Rat.401 (anti-nestin) (Hockfield and McKay, 1985; diluted 1:100), TuJ1 (Easter et al., 1993; diluted 1:1000), and RC2 (Misson et al., 1987; undiluted hybridoma supernatant) are mouse monoclonal antibodies. Anti-fibronectin (Collaborative Research; diluted 1:75), anti-GFAP (Eng et al., 1971; undiluted sera), and antibodies to NFκB/rel family members p50, p65, c-rel, and relB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; diluted 1:500) are rabbit antisera. Fluorescein or rhodamine goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rat (Boehinger Mannheim; diluted 1:200) and rhodamine donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunochemicals; diluted 1:200) were used as secondary antibodies. Timed pregnant mice and adult mice were obtained from a colony maintained by the laboratory. The presence of a vaginal plug was used to define embryonic day 0; birth occurred early on embryonic day 19. Whole embryos were frozen in isopentane that had been chilled in liquid nitrogen. Ten-μm sections were cut on a cryostat, mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher), and stored at −70°C until needed. Sections were fixed in methanol at −20°C and incubated with primary antibodies (either separately or in combination) diluted in PBS containing 2% fish gel (Sigma) at 4°C overnight. Then, sections were washed with PBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies, diluted in PBS containing 2% fish gel, for 1 h at room temperature. After further washing, sections were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed with epifluorescent illumination. Similar patterns of immunostaining were seen with each of the anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibodies. For immunostaining of primary cultures and P19 populations, cells were plated on LabTek microslides and fixed and incubated with antibodies as described above. Primary cultures were immunostained 2 days after plating, whereas undifferentiated and differentiated P19 cells were immunostained at various times up to 14 days after plating. P19 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 2.5% fetal calf serum and 7.5% calf serum. For differentiation, cells were trypsinized and placed in non-tissue culture-treated Petri dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum and 3 × 10-7M retinoic acid. After 4 days, the resulting aggregates of cells were trypsinized and plated on tissue culture dishes or on LabTek microslides for immunostaining. Cerebral hemispheres of mouse embryos were dissected at embryonic day 13 and subjected to dissociation as described previously (Huettner and Baughman, 1986). The isolated cells were plated on matrigel (Collaborative Research)-coated LabTek microslides and maintained in α-minimal essential medium with 10% Nu-serum (Collaborative Research), 2 mM glutamine, and 1 mg/ml glucose. VCAM-1 gene promoter constructs fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) have been described previously (Iademarco et al., 1992). For stable transfections, 30 μg of reporter plasmid was cotransfected with 1 μg of pRSVNeo, which contains the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat driving the neomycin resistance gene (Gorman et al., 1982), using the calcium phosphate technique as described previously (Iademarco et al., 1992). Forty-eight h after transfection, 400 μg/ml of G418 was added to the media. After 10 days, the resulting G418-resistant colonies were pooled. CAT activity was analyzed as described previously (Iademarco et al., 1992). Total RNA was isolated as described previously (Rosen et al., 1992) from undifferentiated P19 cells and from P19 cells at different times after treatment with retinoic acid. RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis for VCAM-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs as described (Rosen et al., 1992). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from undifferentiated and retinoic acid-treated P19 cells using a modified Dignam protocol (Dignam et al., 1983). Briefly, 1 × 109 cells were harvested and rinsed with PBS. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 15 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 6.8, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mM dithiothreitol). Cells were lysed using a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclear proteins were extracted in a solution of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.35 M KCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.01% aprotinin, 0.01% leupeptin, and 4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed in 10 mM KCl then purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel-purified, double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled on their 5′ ends with 32P using polynucleotide kinase and used as probes in gel retardation assays. For gel retardation assays, nuclear extract was incubated with 32P-labeled probe for 30 min on ice in 4% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). Oligonucleotide probes containing VCAM-1 gene κB sites and octamers, IgH gene octamers, and the activating transcription factor (ATF)-binding site from the human fibronectin gene promoter have been described previously (Iademarco et al., 1993). Sections of embryonic mouse brain were immunostained with rat anti-mouse antibodies to VCAM-1. Adjacent sections were immunostained with Rat.401, an antibody to the intermediate filament protein nestin, which is a recognized marker of progenitor cells and radial glia cells in the developing CNS (Hockfield and McKay, 1985). Fig. 1, A and B, shows that VCAM-1 is expressed in the ventricular zone of embryonic brain. VCAM-1 is concentrated on the surface of cell bodies in this region. However, there is additional immunostaining for VCAM-1 on cellular projections extending from the ventricular region; these projections are indicative of radial glia whose somata also reside in the ventricular zone. Cells in the ventricular zone also expressed nestin, and nestin is evident on radial glial projections extending out of the ventricular zone (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that VCAM-1 and nestin are coexpressed on progenitor cells and radial glia in the ventricular zone. In an effort to confirm that radial glia express VCAM-1, primary cultures of embryonic telencephalon were doubleimmunostained for VCAM-1 and RC2, a marker of radial glia (Misson et al., 1987). Fig. 1, D and E, show that VCAM-1 is present on RC2-positive cells with characteristic radial glial morphology. As in the brain, VCAM-1 appears to be concentrated on the somata of these radial glia with lower levels apparent on the primary projection. Only a subset of the VCAM-1-positive cells expressed RC2. The VCAM-1-positive, RC2-negative cells probably represent progenitor cells that have yet to differentiate into neurons or glia. Neither VCAM-1 nor nestin was present on neurons that immunostained with TuJ1, an antibody to class III β-tubulin that is expressed early during neuronal differentiation (Easter et al., 1993), nor were they detected on cells expressing a second neuronal marker, neurofilament (results not shown). VCAM-1 was also found in the ventricular zone of the embryonic spinal cord (Fig. 2, D and E). As in the brain, VCAM-1 appeared to be concentrated on the surface of cell bodies, with lower concentrations on radial projections extending out of the ventricular zone. There was no overlap in immunostaining for VCAM-1 and TuJ1 (Fig. 2A), indicating that VCAM-1 is not expressed on neurons in the spinal cord. Cells in the ventricular zone of the spinal cord also immunostained for nestin, and nestin-positive projections were evident extending from the ventricular zone across the spinal cord (Fig. 2, B and C). As in the brain, we conclude that VCAM-1 is expressed on neural progenitor and radial glial cells in the spinal cord. Expression of VCAM-1 in the CNS is developmentally regulated, and no immunostaining was evident in the adult mouse CNS (results not shown). Radial glial cells are transient during development and eventually give rise to astrocytes (Hirano and Goldman, 1988). VCAM-1 was not found on cells that were positive for glial fibrillary protein (GFAP), which is a marker for astrocytes (results not shown), suggesting that VCAM-1 expression diminishes as radial glia take on properties of astrocytes. Factors responsible for the restricted pattern of VCAM-1 during neural differentiation could also control the activity of other genes that are important for lineage fate determination. In an effort to determine how expression of VCAM-1 may be controlled in the developing CNS, we turned to the embryonic carcinoma cell line P19 which can be induced by treatment with retinoic acid to differentiate along a neural pathway (Jones-Villeneuve et al., 1982). Little or no fibronectin matrix was detected in undifferentiated P19 cells (Fig. 3A); however, an extensive matrix was evident 9 days after treatment with retinoic acid (Fig. 3A′). There was little or no immunostaining for VCAM-1 or nestin in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 3, B and C); however, a significant number of cells expressed these proteins by 9 days after treatment with retinoic acid (Fig. 3, B′ and C′). Immunostaining with TuJ1 demonstrated that a neuronal population of cells appears as a result of P19 cell differentiation; however, these cells do not express VCAM-1 or nestin (Fig. 3, D and D′). As in the primary cultures of embryonic brain (Fig. 1, D and E), there was overlap in the expression of VCAM-1 and RC2 (Fig. 3, E and E′, respectively), indicating that a portion of the VCAM-1-positive cells are radial glial-like. Since nestin is expressed by progenitor cells and radial glia, we conclude that the VCAM-1/nestin-positive population of cells, which are RC2-negative, are progenitor-like cells that have yet to differentiate into neurons and glia. Immunostaining for VCAM-1 and nestin decreased by day 14 after treatment with retinoic acid (Fig. 3, F and G, and results not shown). The disappearance (Fig. 3, F and G) coincided with the appearance of the astrocyte marker GFAP (JonesVilleneuve et al., 1982); GFAP was not detected at day 9 (F′ and G′, and results not shown). These results suggest that VCAM-1 expression diminishes as radial glia take on astrocyte-like properties, which is consistent with the pattern of expression observed in the CNS. The pattern of VCAM-1 during P19 cell differentiation then appears to resemble that observed in the developing CNS. To determine whether VCAM-1 expression is controlled at the level of mRNA during P19 cell differentiation, RNA was isolated from P19 cells at various times after treatment with retinoic acid, and VCAM-1 mRNA levels were analyzed by Northern blot (Fig. 4B). As with the protein, no VCAM-1 mRNA was detected in undifferentiated cells. VCAM-1 mRNA first appeared at day 6 after treatment with retinoic acid, and the level of the message increased at day 9. However, there was a subsequent decrease in message level at day 12 and again at day 14. This pattern of VCAM-1 mRNA then mirrors that of the protein, which is not evident until after day 4 and which dissipates by day 14 as GFAP-positive astrocytes appear (Fig. 3, B, B′, F, and G, and results not shown). The level of VCAM-1 mRNA at day 9 was as high or higher than that in the C2C12 myoblast cell line (Fig. 4), which we have shown previously expresses VCAM-1 mRNA (Rosen et al., 1992). Retinoic acid-induced differentiation of P19 cells involves a 4-day exposure of the cells to retinoic acid followed by the subsequent removal of the morphogen. Thus, the fact that VCAM-1 mRNA was not detected until day 6, which is well after the removal of retinoic acid suggests that the effect of retinoic acid is indirect and involves a retinoic acid-triggered differentiation process. A VCAM-1 gene promoter-CAT construct, 2.1VCAMCAT, which contains 2.1 kb of VCAM-1 gene 5′-flanking sequence driving the CAT gene (Iademarco et al., 1992), was transfected into P19 cells to determine if the increase in VCAM-1 mRNA that occurs upon P19 cell differentiation is a result of an increase in VCAM-1 gene promoter activity. Little CAT activity was detected in undifferentiated cells; however, as with endogenous VCAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA, CAT activity increased at day 7 after treatment with retinoic acid (Fig. 5A). Thus, the increase in VCAM-1 expression that occurs during P19 cell differentiation is due at least in part to an increase in VCAM-1 gene promoter activity. The activity of VCAM-1 gene 5′ deletion mutants was compared to that of the full-length promoter (2.1VCAMCAT) in a series of transfection assays. None of the constructs showed activity in undifferentiated P19 cells (Fig. 5A). However, deletion from position −2.1 kb to position −288 bp (288VCAMCAT) altered the time course of promoter activation: instead of promoter activity rising at day 7 after retinoic acid treatment, as occurs with 2.1VCAMCAT and the endogenous VCAM-1 mRNA and protein, 288VCAMCAT activity increased after only 2 days of treatment with retinoic acid and remained constant until day 11 (Fig. 6). One explanation for such results is that an element or elements in the first 288 bp of the VCAM-1 gene promoter is activated 2 days after treatment with retinoic acid, but sequences between positions −2.1 kb and −288 bp act as a negative element, delaying transcription until day 6-7. Therefore, the pattern of VCAM-1 expression during P19 cell differentiation could be a composite of opposing activities that are mediated by two separate regions of the VCAM-1 gene promoter. To test this possibility, the experiments described below were preformed. First, we addressed the mechanism through which sequences in the first 288 bp of the VCAM-1 gene promoter activate transcription during P19 cell differentiation. To identify promoter elements that are responsible for the activation of 288VCAMCAT, VCAM-1 gene promoter constructs with additional 5′ deletions were tested in transfection assays in P19 cells. Deletion from position −288 to −130 bp had no effect on the activation that occurred in response to retinoic acid treatment (Fig. 5A). There are two κB sites in the VCAM-1 gene promoter located at positions −77 and −63 bp (Iademarco et al., 1992). Both of these sites are required for the activation of VCAM-1 gene expression by tumor necrosis factor-α in endothelial cells. A subsequent deletion to position −68 bp, which removes the upstream site, blocked activation during P19 cell differentiation. The κB sites are the only detectable elements located between position −130 and −68 bp in P19 cells, thus they are sufficient for activation of the VCAM-1 gene promoter during P19 cell differentiation. The lack of activity of 32VCAMCAT, which contains only the first 32 bp of VCAM-1 gene 5′-flanking sequence, suggests that the position-specific enhancer located between the TATA box and transcriptional start site, which is critical for VCAM-1 gene expression in skeletal muscle cells (Iademarco et al., 1993), is not active in P19 cells. These results demonstrate that κB sites are sufficient for activation of the VCAM-1 gene promoter during P19 cell differentiation, and they suggest that the κB sites are also responsible for the activation of −288VCAMCAT at day 2 of treatment with retinoic acid. However, it is conceivable that another element located between position −288 and the κB sites could mediate the early activation of −288VCAMCAT; nevertheless, by the time the intact promoter and the endogenous gene are activated, the κB sites are sufficient for promoter activation. Unlike endothelial cells where the activity of the VCAM-1 gene κB sites is dependent upon cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, the κB sites were not activated in undifferentiated P19 cells by tumor necrosis factor-α, nor did tumor necrosis factor-α affect the constitutive activity of the κB sites in differentiated cells (results not shown). Likewise, the pattern of endogenous VCAM-1 mRNA was unaffected by tumor necrosis factor-α in undifferentiated or differentiated P19 cells. VCAM-1 gene κB sites were used in gel retardation assays with nuclear extracts from undifferentiated P19 cells and from cells either 2 or 9 days after treatment with retinoic acid. No binding to the κB sites was observed with extracts from undifferentiated cells; however, binding was apparent 2 days after treatment with retinoic acid, and it persisted and appeared to increase at day 9 (Fig. 7A). The more slowly migrating complex with extracts from cells treated for either 2 or 9 days with retinoic acid was observed reproducibility; however, the more rapidly migrating complexes were variable with both extracts (they could represent partially degraded products or partial occupancy of the κB sites within the probe). There was a reproducible slight increase in the more slowly migrating complex from day 2 to 9. Most importantly, it should be emphasized that no binding to the κB sites was ever detected with extracts from undifferentiated cells where the sites are inactive, and protein binding correlates with the activation of the sites that occurs during differentiation. As a control, binding of nuclear protein to an ATF site, which interacts with a ubiquitous family of proteins (Brindle and Montminy, 1992), was compared in the different extracts. Similar ATF site binding activity was seen with extracts from undifferentiated cells and day 2 cells; slightly less binding activity was seen with the day 9 extract (Fig. 7A). To determine which NFκB/rel family members are expressed during P19 cell differentiation, undifferentiated and retinoic acid-treated P19 cells were immunostained with antibodies to p50, p65, relB, and c-rel. p50 was found in the nucleus of both undifferentiated and retinoic acid-treated cells (Fig. 8, A and B, respectively). Neither p65 nor relB was evident in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 8, C and E, respectively); however, both proteins were present in a punctate pattern in the nucleus of cells after treatment with retinoic acid (Fig. 8, D and F, respectively). A low level of immunostaining for c-rel was detected in the cytoplasm of both undifferentiated and retinoic acid-treated cells (Fig. 8, G and H). Since no nuclear staining was evident and the cytoplasmic staining was near the limit of detection, it appears that functional c-rel is not present in P19 cells. The patterns of immunostaining in Fig. 8 are at day 2 after treatment with retinoic acid; similar results were also seen at day 9 (results not shown). It has been shown previously in mouse tissues that expression of p50 alone is not sufficient for activation of κB sites (Lernbecher et al., 1993). Thus, it is likely that the complexes of p50/65 and/or p50/relB are responsible for activation of the VCAM-1 gene κB sites during P19 cell differentiation. Both of these complexes have been shown previously to be involved in transcriptional activation through κB sites (Lenardo, 1989; Baeuerle and Baltimore, 1991; Ryseck et al., 1992; Lernbecher et al., 1993). In endothelial cells p65 is present constitutively in the cytoplasm, and in response to inflammatory cytokines it is translocated to the nucleus. In contrast, once p65 and relB appear during P19 cell differentiation, they are present constitutively in the nucleus. Thus, inflammatory cytokines are not required for translocation of the proteins to the nucleus in p19 cells. To determine which NFκB/rel proteins bind the VCAM-1 gene promoter in P19 cells, antibodies to NFκB/rel proteins were included in gel retardation assays with VCAM-1 gene κB sites and nuclear extract from retinoic acid-differentiated P19 cells. A supershift was observed with anti-p50, and the loss of a complex was evident with anti-p65-no effect was seen with anti-RelB or anti c-rel (Fig. 7B and results not shown). These results suggest that it is the p50/p65 complex that binds to the VCAM-1 gene κB sites, resulting in activation of the VCAM-1 gene during P19 cell differentiation. The region of the VCAM-1 gene 5′-flanking region between position −2.1 kb and −288 bp contains multiple octamer consensus sequences. We have shown that these octamers act as silencers in endothelial cells (Iademarco et al., 1993). To determine if these octamers are responsible for the negative activity that prevents VCAM-1 gene expression in undifferentiated cells, we examined the activity of VCAM-1 gene octamers in the context of a heterologous promoter as described (Iademarco et al., 1993). Undifferentiated cells were transfected with pTA-ATF-CAT, which contains a TATA box and an ATF-binding site driving the CAT gene, and pTA-ATF-OCT-CAT and pTA-ATF-IgH-CAT, which contain a VCAM-1 gene octamer and a control octamer from the Ig heavy chain gene enhancer (IgH), respectively. The VCAM-1 gene octamer silenced transcription in undifferentiated P19 cells; however, the IgH octamer had no effect (Fig. 5B). In differentiated cells neither octamer had an effect on promoter activity. These results suggest that octamers in the VCAM-1 gene promoter are responsible for the negative activity of the region between position −2.1 kb and −288 bp in undifferentiated P19 cells, and they demonstrate that there is a difference in the activity of the VCAM-1 gene octamer and the IgH octamer. It should be emphasized that there are at least 10 consensus octamer-binding sites between position −2.1 kb and −288 bp making it difficult to assess the function of the octamers in the context of the VCAM-1 gene promoter directly by mutation analysis. However, the octamers do show the corresponding negative activity when they are placed on a heterologous promoter, suggesting that they are responsible for the negative activity of this region. Nevertheless, even though the octamers show the same activity as the −2.1 kb to −288 bp region during P19 cell differentiation, our experiments do not formally prove that the octamer sites are responsive for the negative activity of this region. Next, we compared the VCAM-1 and IgH octamers in gel retardation assays with nuclear extracts from undifferentiated and differentiated P19 cells. Using nuclear extract from undifferentiated P19 cells, two minor complexes labeled “1” and “2” and a major complex labeled “4” were observed with the VCAM-1 gene octamer (Fig. 9A). Complexes of similar mobility were apparent with the IgH octamer; however, an additional major complex labeled “3” was also apparent. Competition assays with unlabeled octamers demonstrated that the IgH octamer is a higher affinity site than the VCAM-1 octamer: the IgH octamer competed for formation of each of the VCAM-1 and IgH octamer complexes more effectively than the unlabeled VCAM-1 octamer (Fig. 9B). As expected, competition with the VCAM-1 octamer had relatively little effect on formation of complex 3 with the IgH octamer. Complex 3 then appears to correlate with a lack of octamer activity in undifferentiated cells. The pattern of VCAM-1 octamer complexes changed during P19 cell differentiation: 9 days after retinoic acid treatment a complex comigrating with complex 1 was apparent; however, complex 4 had disappeared and new complex migrating with complex 3 had formed (Fig. 9A). By this time, complexes with the IgH octamer were similar in mobility to those observed with the VCAM-1 octamer, and competition assays using unlabeled octamers suggest that the same complexes are formed with the two octamers, but, as with extract from undifferentiated cells, the IgH octamer is a higher affinity site than the VCAM-1 octamer with extract from differentiated cells (Fig. 9, B and C). The finding that, with extract from differentiated cells, the VCAM-1 octamer forms a complex that comigrates with complex 3 further supports the notion that formation of complex 3 correlates with a lack of octamer activity. Next, the pattern of protein binding to the VCAM-1 gene octamers was examined in nuclear extracts at day 2 after treatment with retinoic acid. By this time, the level of complex 4 had decreased relative to that found with extract from undifferentiated cells, whereas complex 3 had appeared, but its level was much lower than with the day 9 extract (Fig. 9A). Therefore, the pattern of binding to the VCAM-1 gene octamer at day 2 appears to be in transition between that seen in undifferentiated cells and cells at day 9. This is in contrast to results with the κB sites where nuclear protein binding increases either at or before day 2 (Fig. 7A). Therefore, the increase in NFκB/rel protein binding and the activation of κB sites appears to be a relatively early event during P19 cells differentiation, whereas the change in the pattern of POU protein binding and the loss of negative octamer activity seems to occur relatively late. Expression of VCAM-1 in the developing nervous system is quite restricted: it is confined to the ventricular zone of the embryonic brain and spinal cord where it is expressed on CNS progenitor cells and radial glia. This pattern of expression suggests that VCAM-1 could be a useful marker to follow neural differentiation. VCAM-1 has the added advantage over some of the other markers such as nestin that have been used to follow similar stages of neural differentiation in that it is a cell surface protein, and as such, it could be utilized to isolate uncommitted CNS cells and follow their differentiation in culture. As a lineage-specific marker of neural differentiation, VCAM-1 could provide insights into molecular events that dictate lineage fates of progenitor cells. The embryonic carcinoma cell line P19 has been widely used as a model of neural differentiation. It has been shown previously that the neuroepithelial marker, nestin, is expressed in P19 cells that have been induced to differentiated along a neural pathway (Shimazaki et al., 1993), suggesting that differentiation of P19 cells into neurons and glia proceeds through neuroepithelial-like progenitor cells, as occurs in the CNS. Our results support this conclusion. We find a number of cells that are positive for VCAM-1 and nestin after differentiation of P19 cells with retinoic acid. With time, these proteins disappear from the differentiated P19 cell cultures, and this occurs with the onset of expression of GFAP, a marker for astrocytes in the adult CNS. Therefore, it appears that VCAM-1 and nestin are present on progenitor cells and radial glia and that their expression subsides as radial glia give rise to astrocytes. We have found previously that κB sites are responsible for cytokine-dependent activation of the VCAM-1 gene promoter in endothelial cells (Iademarco et al., 1992). Here we show that these same sites are also important for expression of VCAM-1 during P19 cell differentiation; however, their pattern of activity is quite different in P19 cells. This is the first evidence that NFκB/rel proteins could have a role in neural differentiation. Activation of the VCAM-1 gene κB sites is a relatively early event during P19 cell differentiation occurring well before the VCAM-1 gene is actually expressed. In contrast to endothelial cells, the κB sites are constitutively active in the P19 cells. We found that three members of the NFκB/rel family are present in the nucleus of P19 cells during differentiation. p50 was present in both undifferentiated and differentiating cells, whereas p65 and relB were only evident in the differentiating cells. p50 alone is not sufficient to activate κB sites in vivo; however, both p50/p65 and p50/RelB are potent activators (Lernbecher et al., 1993). p50 and p65 interact with the VCAM-1 κB sites in gel retardation assays, whereas RelB and c-rel do not, suggesting that the p50/p65 complex is responsible for activation of the VCAM-1 gene during P19 cell differentiation. Interestingly, when p65 appears during P19 cell differentiation, it is concentrated in the nucleus. This is in contrast to endothelial cells where it is present in the cytoplasm and only translocated to the nucleus when cells are exposed to inflammatory cytokines. In endothelial cells IκB binds to p65 retaining it in the cytoplasm, inflammatory cytokines cause disruption of this interaction allowing p65 to be translocated to the nucleus. Thus, IκB-like proteins could be absent from or inactive in P19 cells leading to the constitutive localization of p65 in the nucleus. As noted above, activation of κB sites is an early event that precedes expression of VCAM-1. Although activation of these sites is critical for the subsequent expression of VCAM-1, it appears that the timing of VCAM-1 gene expression is ultimately controlled by the pattern of octamer-binding POU proteins. We show that the pattern of POU protein binding to the VCAM-1 gene octamers changes during P19 cell differentiation and that this change is coincident with a loss of octamer activity. We show that the lack of octamer activity correlates with formation of a specific nuclear protein complex which we designated 3: this complex is not apparent with extract from undifferentiated P19 cells where the VCAM-1 octamer is active; however, it is evident with a control IgH octamer that is inactive (other complexes formed with the VCAM-1 and IgH octamers appear the same), and a comigrating complex appears with the VCAM-1 octamer as it becomes inactive during P19 cell differentiation. If these are all the same complex, then why does the POU protein in this complex only bind to the VCAM-1 octamer in differentiated P19 cells (it obviously binds to the IgH octamer in undifferentiated cells)? One possible explanation focuses on the difference in affinity between the VCAM-1 and IgH octamers. The POU protein that forms complex 3 could have a relatively higher affinity for the IgH octamer (the sequence of the two octamers is slightly different) or the protein may not be in high enough concentration in undifferentiated cells to bind efficiently to the VCAM-1 octamer, which is clearly a lower affinity site than the IgH octamer (nevertheless, it clearly binds the IgH octamer and not the VCAM-1 octamer). During P19 cell differentiation, the level of this POU protein could increase to the point where it binds efficiently to the VCAM-1 octamer. It should be emphasized that although it is an attractive hypothesis that complex 3 is the same in undifferentiated and differentiated cells, this is not essential to explain how VCAM-1 octamers lose repressor activity during P19 cell differentiation (i.e. the POU protein responsible for repressor activity could simply dissipate during differentiation; there is a clear change in the pattern of protein complexes during P19 cell differentiation). Several POU proteins have been shown to be expressed selectively in the CNS where they are thought to have roles in neural differentiation (Rosenfeld, 1991; Ruvkun and Finney, 1991; Wegner et al., 1993). As a model of neural differentiation, expression of POU proteins has been examined during P19 cell differentiation. One of these proteins, Oct-6 (also known as SCIP and Tst-1), is expressed in undifferentiated P19 cells, and its level of expression subsequently decreases during P19 cell differentiation (Meijer et al., 1990; He et al., 1991; Collarini et al., 1992). This decrease is gradual and is not complete until well after treatment with retinoic acid. Thus, the pattern of Oct-6 expression shows an inverse relationship to that of VCAM-1 during P19 cell differentiation, suggesting that it could negatively regulate VCAM-1 gene expression. In support of this possibility Oct-6 has been shown to be a transcriptional repressor in neural cells (He et al., 1991). Furthermore, it is thought to have a role in glial differentiation (Collarini et al., 1992), where VCAM-1 expression is developmentally regulated. Another POU protein that is expressed in a pattern similar to that of Oct-6 during P19 cell differentiation is Oct-3 (Okamoto et al., 1990; Rosner et al., 1990, 1991; Shimazaki et al., 1993). It has been demonstrated that the pattern of Oct-3 expression inversely correlates with that of nestin (which parallels that of VCAM-1) in differentiating P19 cells and that forced expression of Oct-3 results in a loss of nestin expression (Shimazaki et al., 1993). These properties suggest that Oct-3 and/or Oct-6 could be responsible for the negative activity of the VCAM-1 gene octamers during neural differentiation. However, other neural-specific POU proteins with repressor activity have also been described (Dent et al., 1991; Stoykova et al., 1992), indicating that several different POU proteins could mediate the inhibitory activity of the octamers in the VCAM-1 gene promoter observed in P19 cells.

Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedures were set up for screening hybridomas producing specific antibodies. Four mAbs (81-23, 146-40, 315-25, and 320-24) of the IgG1 isotype were found to react with HPL in both simple sandwich and double sandwich ELISAs, while mAb 248-31, of the IgG2b isotype, reacted only with HPL in a double sandwich ELISA. The results of Western blot analysis carried out with native and SDS-denatured HPLs indicated that mAb 248-31 recognized only native HPL, while all the other mAbs recognized both forms of HPL. Since mAb 248-31 did not recognize SDS-denatured HPL, it was not possible to localize its epitope. To carry out epitope mapping along the primary sequence of HPL, four fragments (14, 26, 30, and 36 kDa) resulting from a limited chymotryptic cleavage of HPL were characterized by Western blotting as well as N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis.Of the above five anti-HPL mAbs, four (81-23, 248-31, 315-25, and 320-24) were found to inhibit the lipolytic activity of HPL (in both the presence and absence of bile salts and colipase), while mAb 146-40 had no inhibitory effects. The epitope recognized by mAb 146-40 was found to be located in the N-terminal domain (Lys1-Phe335). Combined immunoinactivation and epitope mapping studies showed that three inhibitory mAbs (81-23, 315-25, and 320-24) recognize overlapping epitopes from the hinge region between the N- and C-terminal domains of HPL, belonging to the 26-kDa fragment.In the presence of lipids, a significant decrease has been observed in the bending angle between the N- and C-terminal domains of the HPL tertiary structure (van Tilbeurgh, H., Egloff, M.

From the present immunochemical data, we further propose that locking the hinge movement with mAbs may induce lipase immunoinactivation. In mammals, the digestion of dietary triacylglycerols is mediated by two main enzymes, a preduodenal lipase that is secreted in the upper part of the digestive system and acts along the whole gastrointestinal tract and a pancreatic lipase that contributes to lipid digestion only in the duodenum(1Gargouri Y.

Unlike serine esterases, digestive lipases develop their full activity only on emulsified substrates. Lipase catalysis therefore involves an interfacial activation step occurring at water/lipid interfaces. Moreover, to overcome the inhibitory effects of the bile salts present in the intestinal lumen, pancreatic lipase specifically requires the presence of a small pancreatic cofactor (colipase) that anchors the pancreatic lipase to the bile salt-coated lipid interfaces(4Erlanson-Albertsson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1125: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has been established using biochemical methods that human pancreatic lipase (HPL) 1The abbreviations used are: HPLhuman pancreatic lipasemAbmonoclonal antibodypAbpolyclonal antibodyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPVCpolyvinyl chloridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. consists of an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain, which are connected together by a hinge region(5Bousset-Risso M.

Crystallographic data have shown that Ser152, which is essential for the lipase activity to occur on emulsified substrates, forms with Asp176 and His263 the enzyme's catalytic triad(7Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). It has also been established that the catalytic site is covered by a loop (the lid) on the surface of the molecule and that it is therefore not accessible to solvent or substrate molecules ((7Winkler F.K. D'Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar); see Fig. 1). The recently elucidated three-dimensional structures of the complexes formed between lipase and procolipase on the one hand (8van Tilbeurgh H. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1992; 359: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and lipase-procolipase-bile salts-phospholipid on the other hand (9van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar) indicate first that procolipase interacts with the C-terminal domain of lipase. In the presence of mixed bile salt-phospholipid micelles, the lid covering the catalytic site of lipase undergoes a conformational change that leads to the binding of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme(9van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In this new “open” conformation of the enzyme, the two lipase domains slightly rotate around the hinge region, and the N-terminal domain of the lipase then interacts with the procolipase via the open lid. human pancreatic lipase monoclonal antibody polyclonal antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay polyvinyl chloride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography. Using the monolayer technique, it has been established that HPL, in the absence of bile salt and colipase, can efficiently hydrolyze water-insoluble monomolecular films of diacylglycerols(10Verger R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 64: 340-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This means that in the presence of an interface, the opening of the lid (interfacial activation) in HPL does not require the presence of colipase or bile salts. Monoclonal antibodies provide useful tools for investigating the structure-function relationships of proteins. This approach was previously found to be particularly fruitful in the case of colipase and human gastric lipase(11Bosc-Bierne I. de La Fournière L. Rathelot J. Hirn M. Sarda L. Biochim. Biophys.

We have now produced five mAbs against HPL and examined the effects of these antibodies on the catalytic activity in the presence and absence of bile salts and colipase. By combining immunoinactivation with epitope mapping techniques, we identified the structural regions of HPL that are responsible for catalysis and interfacial binding. HPL devoid of colipase was purified from human pancreatic juice as described by De Caro et al.(15De Caro A. Figarella C. Amic J. Michel R. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Porcine pancreatic colipase (in the form of procolipase) was a gift from Prof. L. Sarda (Laboratoire de Chimie Biologique, Marseille, France). The specific activities of pancreatic lipase and colipase were measured titrimetrically using standard assays previously described by Gargouri et al.(16Gargouri Y. Julien A. Bois A.G. Verger R. Sarda L. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1336-1342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Rathelot et al.(17Rathelot J. Julien R. Canioni P. Coeroli C. Sarda L. Biochimie (Paris). 1975; 57: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and were estimated to be 8000 and 10,000 units mg-1, respectively. Bovine serum albumin and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G conjugated to peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase were from Sigma. The concentrations of solutions of purified HPL, porcine colipase, and antibodies (IgG isotype) were estimated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using absorbance coefficients (A1 cm1%) of 13.3, 3.6, and 14, respectively. Rabbits were injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly every 3 weeks with 0.5-1 mg of HPL. The first injection included complete Freund's adjuvant, while the last three injections contained incomplete adjuvant. The sera were tested to detect any anti-HPL reactivities by performing ELISA and immunoblotting assays. Finally, the rabbit anti-HPL pAbs were purified on a column of immobilized HPL. For this purpose, 13 mg of HPL were bound to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) using the same procedure as that described by Aoubala et al.(18Aoubala M. Douchet I. Laugier R. Hirn M. Verger R. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Three young female BALB/c mice were immunized by performing subcutaneous injections of pure native HPL. The first two injections were carried out with 50 μg of HPL emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and the third with 120 μg of HPL in 10 mM Na2HPO4/KH2PO4 (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM NaCl (PBS). The immunizations were carried out at 3-week intervals. Two weeks after the last injection, the anti-HPL specificity of the sera was tested by performing a simple sandwich ELISA. Three days before the fusion, the selected mouse was given a boost immunization with 50 μg of HPL. Fusion was performed as described by Köhler and Milstein(19Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12802) Google Scholar). The spleen cells from immunized mouse were fused with X63-Ag8.653 myeloma cells, and cloning of selected hybridomas was achieved by means of the limited dilution technique. The culture supernatants were screened using the ELISA and Western blotting methods described below. For ascites production, 2.5 × 106 hybridoma cells were injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice. mAbs were purified from mouse ascitic fluids by precipitation with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate followed by affinity chromatography using either immobilized HPL bound to Affi-Gel 10 or protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Isotyping of selected mAbs was carried out with a culture supernatant of each clone using the Amersham isotyping kit. The protocol was set up according to the manufacturer's instructions. The hybridomas producing specific anti-HPL antibodies were screened by performing solid-phase immunoassays using microtiter polyvinyl chloride plates (Maxisorb, Nunc). Two ELISA methods were developed for this study. First, a simple sandwich ELISA was carried out by coating the plates with 500 ng of pure HPL/well using an identical procedure to that previously described by Aoubala et al.(13Aoubala M. Daniel C. De Caro A. Ivanova M.G. Hirn M. Sarda L. Verger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Second, a double sandwich ELISA was performed by coating the plates with 500 ng of pure anti-HPL pAb/well (captor antibody). After saturation of the remaining free sites with bovine serum albumin, HPL was added to the PVC-coated pAb (500 ng/well), which, unlike the simple sandwich ELISA, results in random orientation of the various epitopic regions of the antigen. Electrophoresis in the presence and absence of SDS was carried out in a Bio-Rad Mini Protein II dual vertical slab gel electrophoresis cell on 10-12% polyacrylamide as described by Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The immunoreactivity of each mAb with HPL was also studied using the Western blotting technique. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane either electrophoretically from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel or by passive diffusion from native polyacrylamide gels using the procedure described by Gershoni and Palade(21Gershoni J.M. Palade G.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 124: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). After the transfer, nitrocellulose membranes were rinsed three times with PBS. To block the remaining free sites, the blots were incubated with a solution of PBS containing 3% skimmed milk (commercial grade) for 1 h at room temperature. Thereafter, culture hybridoma supernatants or purified mAbs in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 were incubated individually for 1 h at room temperature. The strips were rinsed three times with PBS/Tween-20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:2000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase conjugated with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Sigma). The blots were washed three times with PBS/Tween-20 and two times with 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) containing 0.1 M NaCl, and the specific immunoreactivity was revealed with the substrate solution of the alkaline phosphatase (0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.5) containing 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, and 3.5 mM nitro blue tetrazolium). The measurement of the dissociation constants of each HPL•mAb complex was carried out with an ELISA as described by Friguet et al.(22Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Briefly, various concentrations of HPL (ranging from 2.10-5 to 3.10-10M) were first incubated in solution with a constant concentration of each mAb (2.10-9M) until equilibrium was reached. The concentration of free antibody was then determined by performing a simple sandwich ELISA as described above. To study the ability of each mAb to inhibit HPL lipolytic activity, a fixed amount of enzyme (10-20 μg) was incubated with each mAb at various molar ratios. Incubations were performed in PBS (70-μl final volume) for 1 h at 37°C. The residual activity of the HPL•mAb complexes was measured titrimetrically at pH 8 and 37°C using the pH-stat method in two different assays. In the first assay (see Fig. 3A), the lipase activity was measured using trioctanoin as substrate without any bile salts or colipase. 0.5 ml of pure trioctanoin (Sigma) was emulsified in 150 mM NaCl to give a final volume of 15 ml. In the second assay (see Fig. 3B), the lipolytic activity of HPL was colipase-dependent in the presence of bile salts. 0.5 ml of pure trioctanoin was emulsified in a solution of 0.3 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 150 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate (Sigma) to give a final volume of 15 ml. Colipase was added in a 2-fold molar excess. Another immunoinactivation assay was carried out by preincubating HPL and colipase (1:2 molar ratio) in the presence of sodium taurodeoxycholate (2 mM) and egg phosphatidylcholine (1 mM). After 2 h of incubation at 37°C, mAbs were added (mAb/HPL molar ratio of 1:1) for an additional 1 h of incubation. The residual activity was measured on trioctanoin in the presence of bile salts as described above. Epitope mapping studies with native and SDS-denatured HPLs were performed using three different methods. In the first experiment, the epitope specificity of anti-HPL mAbs was first established using the ELISA additivity method described by Friguet et al.(23Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Pagès J. Bussard A. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 60: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with 2.5 ng of native HPL/well, and mAbs were cotitrated in pairs at a molar ratio of 1:1. The ELISA procedure was performed as described previously by Aoubala et al.(13Aoubala M. Daniel C. De Caro A. Ivanova M.G. Hirn M. Sarda L. Verger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the second experiment, anti-HPL Fab fragments were prepared from each mAb as described by Parham(24Parham P. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2895-2902PubMed Google Scholar), and Fab•HPL complexes were formed by incubating HPL and Fab at a 1:1 molar ratio for 1 h at 37°C in PBS. Fab•HPL ternary complexes were formed by mixing HPL with pairs of Fab fragments (HPL/Fab1/Fab2 molar ratio of 1:1:1). The binary and ternary complexes were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography as described by Rugani et al.(25Rugani N. Dezan C. Bellon B. Sarda L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of the binary complex (Fab•HPL) mixture (0.1 nmol/0.1 nmol) and ternary complex (Fab1•HPL•Fab2) mixture (0.1 nmol/0.1 nmol/0.1 nmol) were applied to a Beckman Spherogel column (7.5 × 600 mm) equilibrated with 0.2 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.8) and coupled to a Beckman TSK precolumn (7.5 × 7.5 mm). Protein elution was carried out with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and monitored at 230 nm. The retention times (in minutes) of the binary and ternary complexes were determined from the separation chromatographic profile as described by Rugani et al.(25Rugani N. Dezan C. Bellon B. Sarda L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In the third experiment, an epitope mapping study was also performed using the peptide mapping method described by Wilson and Smith(26Wilson J.E. Smith A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12838-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The epitopes within specific HPL fragments obtained by limited chymotryptic cleavage were located by Western blotting as described above. Briefly, HPL was subjected to limited digestion with chymotrypsin as described by Abousalham et al.(6Abousalham A. Chaillan C. Kerfelec B. Foglizzo E. Chapus C. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the products were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose or Glassybond membranes for Western blotting and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis(27Vandekerckhove J. Bauw G. Puype M. Van Damme J. Van Montagu M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), respectively. Automated Edman degradation of the protein was performed using an Applied Biosystems Model 470A gas-phase sequencer. The phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified by HPLC on a Brownlee PTH-C18 column (2.1 × 220 mm; Beckman Instruments) and were quantified by means of an integration program on a Waters 840 data control station. To produce mAbs against functional regions of HPL, the native enzyme was used as antigen. One successful fusion was required to obtain the five anti-HPL producing cell lines of interest. Hybridoma cells secreting specific mAbs were screened by performing two different ELISAs with native HPL and by Western blotting with native and SDS-denatured enzymes. The clones selected and the class of antibodies secreted were as follows: 81-23, 146-40, 315-25, and 320-24, which are of the IgG1 isotype, and 248-31, which is of the IgG2b isotype. The double sandwich ELISA procedure was used to select clone 248-31, while the other clones were selected by performing a simple sandwich ELISA. The results of the Western blot analysis showed that mAbs 81-23, 146-40, 315-25, and 320-24, reacting with the HPL directly adsorbed to the PVC plates, recognized both native and SDS-denatured HPLs, whereas mAb 248-31, which did not react with the HPL adsorbed to the PVC plates, recognized only native HPL. The titration curves given in Fig. 2 indicate that all five mAbs showed different reactivities with HPL, whether it was directly adsorbed to the PVC plate (Fig. 2A) or indirectly fixed through the pAb previously adsorbed to the same plate (Fig. 2B). In all the cases studied, the maximal signal obtained with increasing mAb concentrations occurred at concentrations above 0.3 μg/ml (15 ng/well), which corresponds to the saturation of all the accessible epitopes. Fig. 2A also shows that mAb 248-31 does not recognize PVC-adsorbed HPL, as previously observed during the screening procedure. The reactivity of each mAb was also studied in a double sandwich ELISA in which a specific pAb was first adsorbed to the PVC plates. The latter procedure results in the random orientation of HPL. As expected (Fig. 2B), the reactivity of each mAb was higher than previously observed on the basis of the simple sandwich ELISA (Fig. 2A). It is worth noting that mAb 248-31 reacted with HPL only under these conditions. Furthermore, the optical density signals observed with mAb 248-31 were proportional to the amount of HPL added (up to 10 ng/well) in the double sandwich ELISA, whereas no significant signal was detected with the simple sandwich ELISA (data not shown). The interactions of each mAb with native and SDS-denatured HPLs were also studied using the Western blotting technique. Table 1 shows that four mAbs (81-23, 146-40, 315-25, and 320-24) reacted with both native and SDS-denatured HPLs, while mAb 248-31 recognized only native HPL. The values of the dissociation constants determined with the native HPL•mAb complexes in solution, using the ELISA procedure described by Friguet et al.(22Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), are also given in Table 1.Table I Open table in a new tab The potentially inhibitory effects of the five mAbs on the lipolytic activity of HPL were tested. The results given in Fig. 3 show that four mAbs (81-23, 248-31, 315-25, and 320-24) reduced the hydrolysis of trioctanoin by HPL, while mAb 146-40 had no effect. It is worth noting that comparable inhibition levels were observed in both the presence (Fig. 3B) and absence (Fig. 3A) of colipase and bile salts. We also observed similar inhibitory levels using mAbs or their respective Fab fragments (data not shown). To investigate the effects of the conformational changes induced by an interface (lid opening) upon the immunoreactivity of HPL with inhibitory mAbs, experiments were carried out to test various mAbs, or their corresponding Fab fragments, with HPL and colipase previously incubated in the presence of mixed bile salt-phospholipid micelles. Under these conditions, identical levels of HPL immunoinactivation were observed (data not shown). To test whether the anti-HPL mAbs each recognized different epitopes on HPL, the ELISA double antibody binding test (ELISA additivity test) developed by Friguet et al.(23Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Pagès J. Bussard A. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 60: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) was used. Competition between two antibodies for the HPL adsorbed to the PVC plate was expressed by means of ELISA additivity indexes (AIe) using the following formula: AIe = ((2A1+2/(A1+ A2)) - 1) × 100, where A1+2 is the absorbance obtained in the ELISA with the mixture of two mAbs at a 1:1 molar ratio, and A1 and A2 are the absorbances obtained with each mAb, respectively. This index (expressed as a percentage) makes it possible to evaluate the simultaneous binding of two mAbs to the antigen. Four mAbs (81-23, 146-40, 315-25, and 320-24) were studied in all the possible pairs, and the AIe values are given in Table 2. Unfortunately, mAb 248-31 could not be tested because of its lack of immunoreactivity with HPL adsorbed to PVC plates (Fig. 2A). Based on the values of the additivity index given by the ELISA (see above the diagonal in Table 2), these mAbs can be classified into two groups of antibodies directed against two different antigenic determinants: Group I (AIe < 50%) includes three mAbs (81-23, 315-25, and 320-24), and Group II (AIe > 50%) consists of mAb 146-40.Table II Open table in a new tab Another strategy employed recently in epitope mapping studies by Rugani et al.(25Rugani N. Dezan C. Bellon B. Sarda L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) involved incubating the antigen with all the possible pairs of Fab fragments prepared from each mAb. The Fab-antigen complexes were then separated by gel filtration chromatography, and the retention times of binary and ternary complexes were characterized (see below the diagonal in Table 2). In practical terms, this amounts to assessing the molecular size of the Fab-antigen complexes formed. To normalize the results of the gel filtration chromatography, a new additivity index (AIc) has been defined for a pair of Fab fragments as follows: AIc = ((T1 - Tx)/(T1 - T2)) × 100, where Tx is the retention time for a given pair of Fab fragments, T2 is the minimal retention time of a ternary complex (HPL and two Fab fragments), and T1 is the maximal retention time of a binary complex (HPL and one Fab fragment). If the two Fab fragments bind to the same site, Tx will be equal to T1, and AIc will be equal to zero. If, on the contrary, the two Fab fragments bind independently at separate sites, Tx will be equal to T2, and AIc will be equal to 100%. Using this new index (see data below the diagonal in Table 2), we confirmed the previous classification of four mAbs into two groups (I and II) based on the ELISA additivity test of Friguet et al.(23Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Pagès J. Bussard A. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 60: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, with this separate chromatographic method, it was possible to identify mAb 248-31 as constituting a distinct group (III) since it forms ternary complexes (AIc > 50) with HPL and Fab fragments belonging to either Group I (mAbs 81-23, 315-25, and 320-24) or Group II (mAb 146-40). To carry out epitope mapping along the primary sequence of HPL, four fragments resulting from the limited chymotryptic cleavage of HPL (14, 26, 30, and 36 kDa) were characterized by Western blotting (Fig. 4) and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Based on the latter analysis, these fragments were located along the primary amino acid sequence of HPL (Fig. 5). However, from the known amino acid sequence of HPL, as shown in Fig. 5, a fifth peptide of ~12 kDa (Pro288-Phe335) is expected to be generated by the chymotryptic cleavage of the lipase at the two cleavage sites (Phe227 and Phe335). In fact, this peptide contains 13 other potential chymotryptic cleavage sites (Phe and Tyr). This suggests that this peptide (Pro288-Phe335) is highly sensitive to chymotryptic proteolysis, which might explain why we did not detect it using either SDS-PAGE or the Western blotting technique.Figure 5:Diagram of the primary sequence of HPL. The arrows show the chymotryptic cleavage sites (ChT). The N-terminal domain (emptyframe) as well as the C-terminal domain (dottedframe) are indicated. The various HPL fragments are labeled with their corresponding experimental molecular masses (14, 26, 30, and 36 kDa). The dashedline indicates the undetermined C-terminal end of the 36-kDa fragment. Sequenced peptides, determined using the Edman degradation technique, are indicated in boldfaceletters, and those deduced from the cDNA sequence are indicated in italicletters. Numbering in parentheses has been used to indicate the mAbs that recognized their corresponding fragments. The approximate location of the hinge region is indicated. CHO is the carbohydrate moiety linked to Asn166.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 4, the anti-HPL pAbs reacted with the four HPL fragments (lane2), while individual mAbs exhibited differential staining patterns. mAb 146-40 reacted with the 30- and 36-kDa fragments (lane3). These two fragments did not include the C-terminal domain of HPL (14-kDa fragment from Ala336 to Cys449; see Fig. 5). These results indicate that the epitope recognized by mAb 146-40 is present in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme (Lys1-Phe335). On the other hand, mAbs 81-23, 315-25, and 320-24 react only with the 26-kDa fragment (Fig. 4, lanes 4-6), which includes the entire C-terminal domain of HPL (Ala336-Cys449) and part of the N-terminal domain of HPL (Pro288-Phe335) (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:). The latter mAbs do not immunoreact, however, with either the C-terminal domain generated by the chymotryptic cleavage at Phe335-Ala336 or the chymotryptic fragments of the N-terminal domain of HPL (30 and 36 kDa). An obvious advantage of mAbs as compared with polyclonal antisera is the selectivity with which they interact with the antigen. When the antigen is a multifunctional protein such as a lipase, mAbs provide a useful approach for correlating specific structural characteristics with functional features of the protein. The aim of this study was to produce mAbs that specifically recognize native HPL. These antibodies are of special interest since they can be used to identify the various regions of the lipase molecule involved in the hydrolysis of lipid substrates and are complementary to the three-dimensional structure of HPL. Five mAbs against native HPL were produced, and their interactions with the native and SDS-denatured enzymes as well as their effects on the lipolytic activity of HPL were investigated. Four mAbs (81-23, 146-40, 315-25, and 320-24) were found to react with the HPL adsorbed to the PVC plate (simple sandwich ELISA), while mAb 248-31 did not react. All five antibodies interacted, however, with HPL in the double sandwich ELISA. These results can be explained by the fact that the epitope recognized by mAb 248-31 is in a hydrophobic region adsorbed to the PVC plate and is therefore not accessible to the antibody. An alternative explanation might be that a conformational change (denaturation) may have occurred during HPL adsorption to the PVC plate, resulting in the loss of the recognition site. In the case of proteins with functional hydrophobic regions such as lipolytic enzymes, the double sandwich ELISA involving specific polyclonal antibodies adsorbed as the first layer on PVC plates therefore yields randomly oriented antigenic regions and preserves the second antibody recognition. As regards the effects of the five mAbs on the lipolytic activity of HPL, it was observed that four mAbs (81-23, 248-31, 315-25, and 320-24) had inhibitory effects on the activity of the enzyme under standard assay conditions in both the presence and absence of bile salts and colipase (Fig. 3). It is worth noting that the presence of bile salts and phospholipid did not significantly affect the antigenic recognition, probably because the affinity of HPL for mAb is higher than that of lipids. This situation is highly favorable for ELISA determination of HPL under in vivo conditions(3Carrière F. Barrowman J.A. Verger R. Laugier R. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 876-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Aoubala M. Douchet I. Laugier R. Hirn M. Verger R. De Caro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To localize epitopes within the structure of the lipase, three epitope mapping procedures were carried out. From the two additivity tests, it was concluded that the five mAbs can be assigned to three different groups of antibodies that are directed against three different antigenic regions on HPL. Group I contains three mAbs (81-23, 315-25, and 320-24) that recognize closely overlapping epitopes in the same antigenic region; Group II contains mAb 146-40; and Group III contains mAb 248-31. These results were complemented with peptide mapping data and served to localize two antigenic regions in the primary sequence of HPL that are recognized by two of the three groups of antibodies. mAb 146-40, which does not inhibit HPL, recognized the N-terminal domain of HPL, and its epitope is located between the N-terminal residue and residue 227. Since this region contains the catalytic Ser152, which is covered by the lid, this mAb is probably directed toward a site that is distinct from the active center of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 5, the three mAbs (81-23, 315-25, and 320-24) that inhibit lipolytic activity reacted only with the 26-kDa HPL fragment containing part of the N-terminal domain (Pro288-Phe335) and the entire C-terminal domain (Ala336-Cys449). The lack of immunoreactivity of the above antibodies against the C-terminal domain (14 kDa) and against the 36-kDa peptide suggests two possibilities. (i) The antigenic region of HPL, which was recognized by the three inhibitory mAbs, might be cleaved by chymotrypsin at the bond between Phe335 and Ala336, inducing a loss of these antibodies' immunoreactivity against the two separated domains of HPL; or (ii) the 36-kDa peptide might result from a chymotryptic cleavage at the C-terminal end of the N-terminal domain of HPL (Lys1-Phe335). Since HPL is a glycoprotein having a carbohydrate moiety with a molecular mass of ~3 kDa (15De Caro A. Figarella C. Amic J. Michel R. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that is linked to Asn166(28Fournet B. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. De Caro J. Rovery M. van Kuik J.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), it is likely that the N-terminal domain of HPL may be truncated at its C-terminal end, to the extent of ~20-30 amino acid residues. This truncation is located at the hinge region and probably contains the epitopes recognized by the three inhibitory mAbs (Fig. 5). In both cases, the above results clearly indicate that these mAbs recognized closely overlapping epitopes that were included in the hinge region between the N- and C-terminal domains of HPL. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the three-dimensional structure of HPL indicating the location of the two chymotryptic cleavage sites. From this schematic three-dimensional structure, the accessibility of the two cleavage sites (Phe227 and Phe335) might explain the loss of immunoreactivity of the three inhibitory mAbs toward the three characterized proteolytic fragments of HPL (36, 30, and 14 kDa). The results of the immunoinactivation and epitope mapping studies support the hypothesis that the binding of mAbs 81-23, 315-25, and 320-24 to native HPL, in both the presence and absence of a substrate, affects the essential rearrangement of the enzyme recently described in the context of studies on the three-dimensional structure of the HPL-procolipase-phospholipid complex(9van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the open lid is stabilized by many new hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, partly with the core of the protein and partly with the N-terminal region of procolipase. When mAbs, or their respective Fab fragments, interact with the hinge region in the absence of the substrate, they may inhibit all the conformational changes in the lid that are essential for the interfacial activation to occur. It is worth noting that in the case of inhibitory Fab fragments that are as large as the HPL molecule, steric hindrance may be a critical step in the expression of lipase activity when the Fab•HPL complexes are formed. Previously published results of in vitro studies have shown, however, that HPL can hydrolyze acylglycerides in the absence of bile salts and colipase. This fact supports the idea that the movement of the lid also occurs without any colipase. The present immunoinactivation and epitope mapping data suggest that the movement around the hinge region between the N- and C-terminal domains of HPL is indeed important for the proper locking of the lid, which is necessary to the positioning of the functional catalytic machinery. This conclusion is in good agreement with crystallographic data showing that a rigid body rotation occurs around the hinge region, resulting in a shift of the lipase C-terminal domain toward the catalytic N-terminal domain(9van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1993; 362: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The three mAbs 81-23, 315-25, and 320-24 provide potentially useful tools for future studies on the essential rearrangement occurring during the interfacial activation and the movement of the lid upon the adsorption of the enzyme to the water/lipid interface.

It is considered that in the absence of normal Rb function unsequestered E2F activity goes unchecked and, therefore, allows unrestricted activation of many genes required for cell proliferation. This includes many putative protooncogene products and cytokines responsible for cell transformation (i.e. c-myc, c-myb, transforming growth factor β1(17Hiebert S.W. Blake M. Azizkhan J. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3547-3552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a mechanism for the deregulated activity of E2F apparently contributes to the oncogenic potential associated with many DNA tumor viruses(18Chellappan S. Kraus V.B. Kroger B. Munger K.

Gene products of many DNA tumor viruses can actively compete for the same binding domain of the Rb gene product as E2F. Therefore, this inhibition of E2F binding to Rb results in free E2F and subsequent activation of many genes responsible for cell growth(5Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Recently, specific E2F activity has been cloned by the ability of the recombinant expression of cDNAs to interact with the Rb protein (21DeFeo-Jones D. Huang P.S. Jones R.E. Haskell K.M.

The identification of the E2F-1 gene has made available an approach to study the activation of suspect target genes by E2F-1. Despite the identification of one E2F-specific gene product, recent evidence to suggest that E2F exists as a multiple heteromeric complex has been established by the cloning and characterization of additional members of the E2F family of cellular transcription factors (25Ivey-Hoyle M.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1850-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Here we take advantage of the cloned E2F-1 protein to examine the role E2F has in transactivating the transcription of a novel cell cycle-regulated DNA repair enzyme. We demonstrate that putative E2F sites, localized within the UDG promoter, contribute to the transactivation of UDG gene transcription and that the major site for E2F transactivation is localized in an E2F consensus sequence within the first exon. In addition, we have identified this sequence as a specific target for E2F-1/DP1 binding in vitro. Because of the closest relative homology of this nuclear species of UDG to the cyclin A protein, we tested the possibility that this UDG gene product modulates E2F-1 activity through an E2F-responsive target. Although the precise cellular connection of cyclin A-cdk 2 and E2F is still not clearly established, the interaction between cyclin A-cdk2 and E2F has been recently shown to have a negative role on E2F-mediated function (29Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 161-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This is likely an important component for the progression of mitotic events. We have demonstrated here the ability of this nuclear “cyclin-like” species of UDG to repress the activity of E2F-mediated transcription in a cotransfection assay. The likelihood of cellular factors involved in DNA repair, possibly analogous to the role cyclins may have in mediating the transcriptional activity of E2F, may represent alternative pathways regulating E2F function, thereby competing for the control of cell cycle events necessary for the restoration of damaged DNA. A major focus in several recent genetic and biochemical studies is the intersecting relationship between DNA repair and transcriptional control. Many proposed mechanisms have suggested that common factors associated with both DNA repair and gene transcription are functionally related(30Cleaver J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, the role that the tumor suppressor gene product p53 has in both transcriptional control and response to damaged DNA (31Dutta A. Ruppert J.M. Aster J.C. Winchester E. Nature. 1993; 365: 49-53Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar) is unique in our understanding of the complex pathways that integrate gene transcription with specific factors necessary for DNA repair. We suggest one mechanism that implicates E2F-mediated transcription in modulating a cellular factor involved in DNA repair. The 5′-flanking region of the human UDG gene from −1389 to +81, relative to the site of transcriptional initiation, was obtained through cloning of the DNA fragment from normal human liver genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with VentR® DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Oligonucleotide primer sequences were obtained from previously published sequences(4Muller S.J. Caradonna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1310-1319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which included restriction adaptor sequences to facilitate subcloning of the DNA fragments. The DNA fragments containing the 1.4 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region of the UDG gene and series of deletions were generated and cloned directly upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in the XbaI site of plasmid vector pCAT (Promega, Inc.). Progressive deletions from the 5′ end of the UDG gene promoter were engineered by the same PCR-based method using specific oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to selected end points of the UDG gene promoter region. The 5′ deletion mutants designated UDG construct-A, UDG construct-B, UDG construct-C, UDG construct-D/wt, and UDG construct-F were designed to remove specific E2F and Sp1 cognate elements from the UDG promoter by this method. Deletion mutant UDG construct-E was engineered by digesting plasmid minigene UDG construct-D/wt with XbaI, treated with Escherichia coli Exonuclease III (New England Biolabs, Inc.), then blunt ended with mung bean nuclease and E. coli DNA polymerase I (large fragment) enzyme all according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The DNA was recircularized with T4 DNA ligase enzyme to produce circular plasmid DNA. Plasmid expression vectors for E2F-1 and UDG were generated by subcloning cDNA coding region fragments into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen®). The E2F-1 and UDG plasmid cDNAs were generously provided by William Kaelin (Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Boston, MA) and Sal Caradonna (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Stratford, NJ), respectively. The plasmids provided appropriate DNA fragments to subclone both the E2F-1 and UDG cDNAs into pcDNA3. Expression vector pCMV/E2F-1 was generated by digesting the E2F cDNA with BamHI and EcoRI subcloned unidirectionally into the BamHI/EcoRI-treated pcDNA3 plasmid. The expression vector pCMV/UDGα was similarly subcloned by insertion of the UDG cDNA EcoRI fragment into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3. The orientation and complete promoter sequence of the reporter minigene constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis using Sequenase® II kit (United States Biochemicals Corp., Cleveland, OH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cloning of E2F-1 and UDG cDNA inserts into expression vector pcDNA3 were also verified the complete cDNA sequence by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of DNA sequencing also using Sequenase® II kit. Mutation of the wild type promoter sequence to generate plasmid minigene UDG construct-D/mut was directed by a PCR-based method(32Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. Second Ed. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1992: 8.18-8.25Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers to generate point mutations, indicated by underlined nucleotide bases, in the E2F recognition sequence were synthesized and the sequences are shown as follows: A, 5′-CCTCTAGACTCAGGGGTGTAAATAACTT-GCCCGAGTTCGGTAGGAGTCCAGACTCAACCGGGAGACGCTCGCGAA-3′; B, 5′-GCCCGGGCCCGCGACAGCCCAGGT-3′. The template for the PCR was plasmid UDG-construct-D/wt. The 239-base pair PCR product was digested with ApaI and XbaI and subcloned back into the backbone fragment to replace the wild type ApaI/XbaI fragment of UDG construct-D/wt with the mutation to generate minigene UDG construct-D/mut. All the mutations were confirmed by chain termination method of DNA sequencing using Sequenase® II according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human Saos 2 (osteosarcoma) cells were maintained in McCoy's 5a medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and gentamicin (100 μg/ml). Transfection assays were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described in detail(33Walsh M.J. Sanchez-Pozo A. LeLeiko N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All plasmid DNAs were purified by two repetitive CsCl gradient centrifugations to obtain supercoiled DNA. Each transfection was carried out in parallel using at least two separate plasmid DNA preparations. To maintain equivalent total amounts of DNA in each transfection assay some plates were supplemented with vector plasmid pGEM-7Zf+ (Promega, Inc.) to bring the total amount to 20 μg plasmid DNA. The DNA-CaPO4 precipitates (1 ml) were added to each plate containing 2.5 ml of medium in 10-cm2 plates. Seven h after transfections were performed, cells were washed throughly with phosphate-buffered saline and they were refed with normal growth medium at 24 and 48 h following transfections. The uptake of DNA was internally standardized by adding 1 μg of control vector pSV-hGH, encoding secreted human growth hormone directed by the SV40 early promoter promoter, for each transfection(34Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested 72 h after transfections and lysed with a transfection lysis reagent (Promega, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Protein concentrations were quantitated by the dye-binding procedure (Bio-Rad). CAT assays were performed essentially as described (33Walsh M.J. Sanchez-Pozo A. LeLeiko N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and CAT activities were determined by acetylation of radiolabeled chloramphenicol. Acetylated chloramphenicol products were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Semi-confluent Saos 2 cells were cotransfected with either 15 μg of expression plasmid pCMV/UDGα or pCMV/0 along with 5 μg of the B-cell surface antigen CD19 cDNA (35Tedder T.F. Isaacs C.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 712-717PubMed Google Scholar) expression plasmid, pcd19-hcr, which were all directed by the CMV early gene promoter. The cotransfected cells were cultured for 48 h in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Immunocytochemical rosettes were formed of cells transiently expressing the B cell-specific CD19 cell surface antigen using an anti-CD19 antibody conjugated to a magnetic bead according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal, Inc., Lake Success, NY). Cotransfected Saos2 cells were enriched for the CD19+ phenotype using the magnetically susceptable beads and detached from the beads according to manufacturer's directions. Cotransfected Saos 2 cells, positively selected for CD19, were then analyzed by flow cytometric procedures. A nucleotide sequence of the protein coding fragment (Thr91 to Ile243) within the UDG gene product was generated by the PCR method using VentR® DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations from a previously cloned cDNA template provided (S. Caradonna, UMDNJ). This was accomplished using synthetic oligonucleotide primers 5′-AAGGGAATTCACGGCGGAATCCCGCTGTAAGCTG-3′ and 5′-AAGGGAATTCCTACGCCAGGAGGGAAGGGGAGTA-3′ containing EcoRI adaptor ends. The PCR product generated was digested with EcoRI and gel purified using a GeneClean™ II kit (Bio101, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified DNA fragment was cloned into the bacterial, pMAL-p2, expression vector (New England Biolabs, Inc.) at the EcoRI site using T4 DNA ligase. Ligated DNA products were used to transform commercially available competent bacteria, DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.). Several colonies were screened for the correctly inserted PCR fragment by inducible protein expression of the correct MalE/UDG fusion gene product. Plasmids containing the protein coding inserts were sequenced using Sequenase II® DNA sequencing kit to verify correct nucleotide sequence and orientation. Expression and affinity purification of the recombinant MBP fusion protein, extending through the cyclin-like domain (Thr91 to Ile243) of the UDG protein, were both essentially performed as described by the manufacturer of MalE protein fusion kit purchased (New England Biolabs, Inc.). One-hundred μg of affinity-purified fusion protein was used to immunize mice over a period of 12 weeks for the production of monoclonal antibodies specific for the detection of human UDG using procedures previously described (Harlow and Lane, 1989). Hybridomas were made, and individual clones were screened for the production of anti-UDG antibodies using the uracil-DNA glycosylase antigen derived from an in vitro translation product using the TNT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate kit purchased (Promega, Inc.). Specific mRNA transcripts were generated from a cDNA template of UDG previously obtained. Monoclonal antibody mAb-u(91-243) was obtained from a hybridoma clone and IgG purified by affinity chromatography. Using approximately 2 × 106 Saos 2 (CD19+ phenotype) cells, cotransfected with either pCMV/UDGα or control pCMV/0, cellular lysates were prepared by sonication at 4°C in the presence of NETN (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl) containing 0.5 mM DTT, 10 mM NaF, 2 mm of sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, TLCK, and TPCK prepared from fresh stocks. Lysates were cleared of debris by microcentrifugation (14,000 × g) at 4°C for 15 min, and proteins were quantitated by the Bradford assay using a commercial kit purchased (Bio-Rad). Twenty-five μg of protein sample were prepared in SDS-sample buffer and fractionated by 8.5% PAGE under denaturing conditions. The polyacrylamide gel was electrophoresed for approximately 4 h under constant voltage (150 V) in running buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS. Proteins resolved by PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinlyidene difluoride membranes (Westran™, Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.) in running buffer under constant current (200 mA) for 30 min at 4°C. Blocking of nonspecific binding by the primary antibody was performed with 5% non-fat dry milk in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoblotting with the monoclonal antibody mAb-u(91-243) diluted 1:1000 was accomplished using the ECL chemiluminescence reagent system (Amersham Corp.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblot was exposed to film XAR5 for 10 s and developed. Saos 2 cultures transfected with either pCMV/UDGα or pCMV/0 identical to those cultures described above were used in flow cytofluorimetry. Flow cytofluorimetry was performed essentially as described (36Dolbreare F. Gratzner H. Pallavicini M.G. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5573-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) using CD19+ population of Saos 2 cells cotransfected with either pCMV/UDGα or pCMV/0. Cell cultures were taken at 36, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively, after each cotransfection and were treated with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 60 min and nuclei were then isolated. Isolated nuclei were incubated with fluoroscein-conjugated IgG antibody, specific for BrdU incorporation (BectonDickinson, Inc.), for 1 h at 4°C. Propidium iodide was subsequently added to the nuclei and incubated. Both BrdUrd incorporation and propidium iodide fluorescence were analyzed to measure, respectively, DNA synthesis and DNA content/nucleus in a FACScan™ (Becton- Dickinson, Inc.) using the Lysis II™ (Hewlett-Packard, Inc.) software program to analyze data. [3H]Thymidine incorporation studies were performed on parallel Saos 2 cell cultures as described previously(37Walsh M.J. Tsao K.-L. LeLeiko N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7026-7035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) bacterial expression plasmid pGEX2TK-E2F-1 containing the E2F-1 cDNA to produce a bacterially expressed recombinant GST/E2F-1 fusion protein was a kindly provided by William Kaelin (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Bacterial strain BL-21 was transformed with the pGEX2TK-E2F-1, cultured in Luria broth (L-broth), and induced with 0.4 mM isoproyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Lysates of the transformed bacteria were generated by sonication in a suspension buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 μg each of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 2 μM each TLCK and TPCK), added immediately prior to preparation of lysates. Glutathione affinity chromatography of fusion protein GST/E2F-1 was performed as described previously(23Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek K. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The DP1 cDNA was generously provided by Rowena Girling and Nicholas La Thangue (Medical Research Council, London, United Kingdom). The DP1 cDNA fragment, necessary to generate a DP1 fusion with the maltose-binding protein MBP (malE) gene, was synthesized by PCR with appropriate adaptor sequences and subcloned into pMAL-c2 vector in frame with the malE gene. The expression and affinity purification of the DP1 fusion gene product was performed according to directions recommended by the manufacturer of pMAL-c2. Affinity-purified gene products of E2F-1 and DP1 were then dialyzed in 1000 volumes of DNA binding buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 40 mM KCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE prior to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). All oligonucleotide DNA fragments were synthesized with a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Complimentary double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild type UDG promoter sequence expressed as UDG construct-D/wt and mutated sequences characterized by UDG construct-D/mut were synthesized and designated as oligonucleotide UDG/wt1 (5′-GGTAGAGAGAAAATTCGCGAAAGCTTTCCCGGTTGAGTC-3′) and UDG/M3 (5′-GGTAGAGAGAAAATTCGCGAGAGC GCTCCCGGTTGAGTC-3′), respectively, were used in the EMSA experiments. Oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed. EMSA reactions were performed as described previously by this laboratory(37Walsh M.J. Tsao K.-L. LeLeiko N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7026-7035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out with nuclear extract from Saos 2 cells or with 25 ng each of purified E2F-1 and DP1 in a 17-μl preincubation mixture with DNA binding buffer for 30 min at 4°C. Then the 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were added and incubated for an additional 30 min in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in DNA binding buffer. Gel electrophoresis was performed on a 4% polyacrylamide (80:1 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide mixture) gel in a Tris acetate buffer as described previously(37Walsh M.J. Tsao K.-L. LeLeiko N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7026-7035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For competition analysis with the mutant UDG promoter E2F consensus oligonucleotide and adenovirus E2F targets, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled competitor (relative to the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide) was added prior to the binding reaction with the wild type 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. Independent cloning of the human UDG promoter from previously published sequences (4Muller S.J. Caradonna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1310-1319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have allowed us to reexamine the sequence of the UDG promoter, which reveals several potential targets for E2F activity. In our attempt to determine if this UDG gene is regulated by E2F-1, cotransfection experiments were conducted using the UDG promoter as a target for E2F-1. Transient expression of the recombinant E2F-1 protein, directed by the cytomegalovirus early gene promoter, allowed us to test the expression of E2F-1 on the transcriptional response given by 1390 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the human UDG gene promoter (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, transient expression of E2F-1 can stimulate the expression of CAT activity when driven by the UDG promoter. Levels of CAT activity were evaluated by phosphoimaging and quantitated the stimulation of approximately 7.8-fold"

Unlike the β-globin gene, the rabbit α-globin gene is transiently expressed at a high level without an added enhancer in transfected erythroid and non-erythroid cells. By examining a series of α/β fusion genes, we show that internal sequences of the rabbit α-globin gene (within the first two exons and introns) are required along with the 5′ flank for this enhancer-independent expression. Furthermore, deletion of the introns of the α-globin gene, or replacement by introns of the β-globin gene, results in severely decreased expression of the transfecting genes. Hybrid constructs between segments of the α-globin gene and a luciferase gene confirm that internal α-globin sequences are needed for high level production of RNA in transfected cells.

In the present work, it was demonstrated that the α1I3•α1-m complex has no inhibitory activity, the bait region was not cleaved by low amounts of proteinases, and it was unable to covalently incorporate proteinases. The results also indicated that the thiolester bond of the α1I3•α1-m complex was broken. The α1I3•α1-m complex was cleared from the circulation much faster than native α1I3, with a half-life of approximately 7 min. Structurally, however, the α1I3•α1-m complex was similar to native α1I3 rather than α1I3 cleaved by proteinases. It is speculated that the role of α1-m is to destroy the function of α1I3 by blocking the bait region and breaking the thiolester and causing its physical elimination by rapid clearing from the blood circulation. It is also possible that the formation of complexes between α1-m and α1I3 may serve as a mean to regulate the function of α1-m since its complex with α1I3 is taken up rapidly by cellular receptors for α-macroglobulins.

The α1I3•α1-m complex was cleared from the circulation much faster than native α1I3, with a half-life of approximately 7 min. Structurally, however, the α1I3•α1-m complex was similar to native α1I3 rather than α1I3 cleaved by proteinases. It is speculated that the role of α1-m is to destroy the function of α1I3 by blocking the bait region and breaking the thiolester and causing its physical elimination by rapid clearing from the blood circulation. It is also possible that the formation of complexes between α1-m and α1I3 may serve as a mean to regulate the function of α1-m since its complex with α1I3 is taken up rapidly by cellular receptors for α-macroglobulins. α1-microglobulin (α1-m), 1The abbreviations used are: α1-mα1-microglobulinα1I3α1-inhibitor-3α2Mα2-macroglobulinPPEporcine pancreatic elastaseDCI3,4-dichloroisocoumarinE-64trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butaneDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. also known as protein HC, is a low molecular weight plasma glycoprotein with various immunoregulatory properties (reviewed in Åkerström and Lögdberg, 1990 and Åkerström, 1992). α1-m is translated in the liver together with bikunin (Kaumeyer et al., 1986; Salier, 1990) as a precursor protein, which is cleaved late in the trans-Golgi network previous to secretion of free α1-m (Bratt et al., 1993). Part of the secreted α1-m is linked covalently to other plasma proteins, and circulating complexes with human IgA (Grubb et al., 1986), rat α1-inhibitor-3 (α1I3) (Falkenberg et al., 1990), and rat fibronectin (Falkenberg et al., 1994) have been isolated and characterized. α1-microglobulin α1-inhibitor-3 α2-macroglobulin porcine pancreatic elastase 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. α1I3•α1-m is a 220-kDa 1:1 covalent complex circulating at a concentration of approximately 40 μg/ml (Falkenberg et al., 1994). Both α1-m and α1I3 are produced by rat hepatocytes, but the site of formation of the complex is not known (Pierzchalski et al., 1992). α1I3 is a 180-kDa proteinase inhibitor belonging to the same superfamily as human α2-macroglobulin (α2M), the α-macroglobulins (Sottrup-Jensen, 1987). Its binding and inhibition of proteinases is dependent on the ability to form covalent cross-links to the proteinases (Enghild et al., 1989a). During the reaction, α1I3 is cleaved in the bait region by a variety of proteinases, leading to a change in conformation and a subsequent activation of an internal thiolester bond. A highly reactive glutamyl residue of the thiolester forms a covalent cross-link with a lysyl residue in the attacking proteinase. The thiolester, which is a common property of many of the α-macroglobulins, can also be broken by a small nucleophilic reagent such as methylamine (Barrett and Starkey, 1973). The conformational shift of α1I3 leads to exposure of a domain with high affinity for receptors on hepatocytes and macrophages, resulting in a rapid clearance of the α1I3-proteinase complex, a property shared by many α-macroglobulins (Debanne et al., 1976; Van Leuven et al., 1979; Gliemann and Sottrup-Jensen, 1987). The complex formation between α1-m and α1I3 raised the question whether α1-m could influence the proteinase inhibitory activity or receptor recognition of α1I3. In this work, the complex was isolated and compared with the native proteinase inhibitor, α1I3. Rat plasma was drawn from Sprague-Dawley rats (B& Universal AB, Sweden) or obtained from Pel-Freez Biologicals. Female CD-1 mice (20 weeks) were bought from Charles River Laboratories (Raleigh, NC). Monoclonal mouse anti α1-m BN 11.3 and BN 11.10, both binding to rat and human α1-m, were prepared as described (Babiker-Mohamed et al., 1991). The IgG fractions of rabbit antisera against rat α1I3 and rat α1-m were prepared as described (Nilson et al., 1986). Hide powder azure, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine trypsin, porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), bovine chymotrypsin, papain, the serine proteinase inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI), the cysteine proteinase inhibitor trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), dithiothreitol (DTT), and methylamine hydrochloride were all from Sigma. Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Cathepsin G was a kind gift from Dr. James Travis (University of Georgia). [14C]Methylamine hydrochloride (59.4 mCi/mmol) was from DuPont NEN. Ultrapure urea was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Rat α1I3 and human α2M were purified from plasma as described earlier (Enghild et al., 1989a; Salvesen and Enghild, 1993). α1I3•α1-m was purified by immunosorbent chromatography using monoclonal mouse antibodies BN 11.3 and BN 11.10 immobilized to Affi-gel Hz (60 mg/3 ml gel) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Plasma from Sprague-Dawley rats was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the plasma filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane. Before applying the sample to the affinity column, plasma was diluted twice with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.12 M NaCl, 3 mM KCl including 10 mM EDTA). The column was rinsed and then eluted with 4 M MgCl2. The eluate was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by concentration. The final purification step was gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology AB, Sweden) in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, after which the α1I3•α1-m containing fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration. Increasing amounts of α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m (0-0.14 nmol) were allowed to inhibit 0.04 nmol of active site-standardized trypsin (Chase and Shaw, 1967) from digesting the high molecular weight substrate hide powder azure. The assay was done as described earlier (Enghild et al., 1989a). Briefly, trypsin and α1I3 or α1I3•α1-m in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature, and 0.4 ml of blue hide powder suspension (12.5 mg/ml in 0.6 M sucrose and 0.05% Triton X-100) were added. The reaction was incubated for another 30-60 min with agitation before terminating by adding 0.3 ml of glycine-HCl, pH 3.0. The undigested blue hide powder was pelleted by centrifugation, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm as a determination of proteolytic activity. Proteins were labeled with Na125I (DuPont NEN) by the solid-state lactoperoxidase method of David and Reisfeld(1974). 125I-Labeled papain was activated with 1 mM DTT in the presence of 1 mM EDTA for 15 min at 37°C. 2 μg of α1I3 or α1I3•α1-m in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, were mixed with 125I-labeled trypsin (50 pmol), PPE (8 pmol), S. aureus V8 proteinase (3 pmol), chymotrypsin (33 pmol), cathepsin G (35 pmol), or papain (3 pmol) and incubated for 5 min. The reactions were stopped, with the exception of the papain reaction, by the addition of DCI to a final of concentration of 250 μM. The papain reaction was terminated with E-64 at a final concentration of 50 μM. The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and examined by autoradiography. 5 ml of rat plasma (Pel-Freez Biologicals) was incubated with 125I-labeled PPE (170 KBq/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding DCI to a final concentration of 250 μM. The pH was corrected to 8.2 with 1 M Tris, and methylamine hydrochloride was added to 100 mM. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, EDTA was added to a concentration of 10 mM; half of the plasma was applied to anti-α1-m, and the remainder was applied to anti-α-1I3-Sepharose. The columns were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 10 mM EDTA and eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. Acidic fractions were neutralized by the addition of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, analyzed for absorbance at 280 nm, and counted for radioactivity. Protein-containing fractions were dried in a Speed Vac concentrator, redissolved in 100 μl of deionized water, and precipitated overnight by adding 900 μl of EtOH. α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m (23 pmol) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, were reacted with 2.3 pmol of PPE or papain for 5 min. Papain was first activated for 15 min with 1 mM DTT in the presence of 1 mM EDTA. The PPE reaction was stopped by adding DCI to 250 μM, and the papain reaction was stopped by adding E-64 to 50 μM. After another 5 min, the samples were made 2% in SDS and 1% in 2-mercaptoethanol before separating by SDS-PAGE (8.5%). α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m (10 μg in 20 μl) were treated with 0.05 μCi [14C]methylamine hydrochloride for 2 h at room temperature after adjusting the pH to 8.2 with 1 M Tris. Unlabeled methylamine was added to 100 mM, and reactions were incubated overnight at room temperature, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Alternatively, 5 ml of plasma (Pel-Freez) was adjusted to pH 8.2 with 1 M Tris, and 50 μCi [14C]methylamine hydrochloride was added. After incubation for 2 h, unlabeled methylamine hydrochloride was added to 100 mM, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h. Finally, EDTA was added, and half of the plasma was applied to anti-α1-m and the other half to anti-α1I3-Sepharose. For further details, see above. SDS-PAGE was performed in 5-15% linear gradient gels using the glycine/2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol/HCl system described by Bury (1981) or in 8.5% slab gels using the buffer system reported by Laemmli(1970). Samples that were separated under reducing conditions were made 50 mM in DTT or 1% in 2-mercaptoethanol. Molecular mass standards were rat α1I3 (180 kDa), Bio-Rad low molecular mass standards, or high molecular mass Rainbow markers from Amersham International. Non-radioactive proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and radioactive proteins were visualized by autoradiography. When analyzing [14C]methylamine hydrochloride-conjugated proteins, gels were washed twice for 20 min each in deionized water after the destaining, equilibrated in 1 M sodium salicylate, dried, and fluorographed. Transverse urea gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by casting 5% polyacrylamide gels with a continuous 0-8 M urea gradient (Goldenberg 1989; Mast et al., 1991). The same buffer system, except SDS, was used as described for SDS-PAGE. α1I3 (150 μg) or 125I-labeled α1I3•α1-m (20 KBq) in 25 μl was incubated with PPE at a molar ratio of 3:1 for 2 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of DCI. Samples were diluted to 500 μl with phosphate-buffered saline and appropriate sample buffer, and radiolabeled samples were filtered through Microfilterfuge™ tubes (Rainin Instrument Co., Inc.), which were saturated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The gel was rotated 90°, and α1I3, 125I-labeled α1I3•α1-m, or PPE-treated α1I3 or125I-labeled α1I3•α1-m were loaded evenly across the top of the gel. The polyacrylamide gels were run for 2 h with a constant current of 13 mA. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or by autoradiography. 125I-Labeled α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m (30 KBq) were injected into the lateral tail vein of CD-1 mice prior to and after a 5-min incubation with trypsin at a molar excess. 125I-labeled α1I3•α1-m was also injected together with a 1000-fold molar excess of methylamine-treated human α2M. Blood samples of 25 μl were collected at timed intervals via retroorbital puncture, and the radioactivity was determined. The radioactivity of the initial blood sample, taken 5-10 s after injection, was defined as representing 100% of the injected sample in circulation (Imber and Pizzo, 1981). The proteins were visualized by electron microscopy using negative staining or rotary shadowing. For negative staining, a drop of protein solution at 30 μg/ml was applied to carbon film made hydrophobic by glow discharge. The film was washed with several drops of uranyl acetate and drained. To prepare the proteins for electron microscopy, samples were sedimented through a 15-40% glycerol gradient (Fowler and Erickson, 1979). The proteins were observed in a Philips EM 301 at a magnification of 150,000. The purpose of this purification was to isolate α1I3•α1-m (Falkenberg et al., 1990) in a native form. α1-m-containing molecules were isolated from rat plasma by anti-α1-m affinity chromatography, using 4 M MgCl2 for elution from the column. 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.0, which was used earlier, completely destroyed the proteinase inhibition activity of α1I3 in blue hide powder assay (not shown). The α1I3•α1-m complex was separated from the two other forms of α1-m, α1-m/fibronectin (Falkenberg et al., 1994) and low molecular weight α1-m, by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 under native conditions. Gradient SDS-PAGE of the concentrated α1I3•α1-m, pooled narrowly, showed that the complex was pure and had a somewhat higher molecular mass compared with free α1I3 (see Fig. 3 A, lanes2 and 4). After separation by non-gradient SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) the α1I3•α1-m complex was seen as a triplet band as previously described (Falkenberg et.al., 1990, 1994). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that all three bands contained α1I3 and α1-m at a 1:1 molar ratio.Figure 2:Bait region cleavage of α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m. α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m were incubated with PPE or papain at a molar ratio of 10:1 for 5 min. PPE incubations were terminated by adding DCI to a 250-μM final concentration and papain by adding E-64 to a 50-μM final concentration. Samples were run reduced in SDS-PAGE as follows: lane1, α1I3 or α1I3•α1-m; lane2, α1I3 or α1I3•α1-m + PPE; lane3, α1I3 or α1I3•α1-m + papain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) equal amounts of α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m (0.01 nmol) were incubated with six different 125I-labeled proteinases: papain, cathepsin G, chymotrypsin, S. aureus V8 proteinase, PPE, and trypsin, enzymes that are known to be inhibited by α1I3. Depending on the rate of labeling, the radioactivity used in each case corresponded to absolute protein amounts from 3 to 50 pmol. The reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1). The autoradiogram shows that α1I3 incorporates all six proteinases. However, no radioactivity was seen to be associated with the α1I3•α1-m band. This shows that α1I3•α1-m does not undergo covalent cross-linking with the proteinases. To exclude the possibility that the purification procedure of the α1I3•α1-m complex caused the loss of the capability of the molecule to interact with various proteinases, 125I-labeled PPE was added directly to rat plasma. After stopping the reaction by adding the low molecular weight inhibitor DCI, half of the plasma volume was applied to anti-α1-m-Sepharose to isolate a pool including the α1I3•α1-m complex, and the other half was added to anti-α1I3-Sepharose to isolate α1I3 Equal amounts from each column were then separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing circumstances (not shown). Radioactive PPE had been incorporated to α1I3 but not to α1I3•α1-m. This agrees well with the former experiment. The ability of α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m to inhibit trypsin was also compared by using the high molecular weight substrate blue hide powder azure. As expected, α1I3 inhibits the trypsinmediated degradation of the substrate, but α1I3•α1-m could not inhibit trypsin even at high concentrations (not shown). α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m were incubated with two proteinases of different specificities, PPE and papain, in a molar ratio of 10:1. The reaction products were separated by reduced SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The cleavage of α1I3 resulted in doublet bands migrating around 100 kDa, which previously have been shown to result from α1I3 bait region cleavage (Enghild et. al., 1989a). α1I3•α1-m, on the other hand, was not cleaved by the proteinases using these conditions, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (not shown), suggesting that the bait region was not accessible on the complex. The nucleophile [14C]methylamine was incubated with α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m, and the reactants were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3). The results demonstrate that α1I3 reacts with the radioactive methylamine, whereas no radioactive methylamine was associated with the α1I3•α1-m complex. To exclude the possibility that the thiolester reactivity of α1I3•α1-m had been destroyed as a result of purification, [14C]methylamine was also incubated with rat plasma. The plasma was then applied to either anti-α1-m or anti-α1I3-Sepharose. Equal amounts of proteins eluted from the two columns were then separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Only very faint radioactivity could be seen in the α1I3•α1-m complex as compared with α1I3 after elution from the anti-α1-m column (not shown). These experiments thus suggest that the thiolester of α1I3 is intact and reactive with methylamine, whereas the thiolester of α1I3•α1-m is broken. It has been shown that α-macroglobulins that are cleaved by proteinases undergo a conformational shift, leading to the exposure of receptor-binding domains and a rapid clearing from circulation (Gauthier et al., 1979). Consequently, it would be of interest to measure the clearance rate of α1I3•α1-m and α1I3 before and after trypsin cleavage. As expected, proteinase-complexed α1I3 was removed from the circulation quicker than the native form (Fig. 4 A). Surprisingly, native α1I3•α1-m was cleared with a half-life of about 7 min, which is almost as quickly as native α1I3 (Fig. 4 B). The clearance of α1I3•α1-m was completely blocked by an excess of methylamine-treated α2M. This shows that native α1I3•α1-m is recognized by α-macroglobulin receptors and cleared from the circulation faster than native α1I3. Furthermore, no increase in clearance rate was seen after incubation of the complex with trypsin, indicating that no significant structural difference exists between trypsin-treated and native α1I3•α1-m, which is completely in line with the inability of the α1I3•α1-m complex to interact with trypsin (see above). The conformational stability of the α1I3•α1-m complex was also investigated by transverse urea gradient-PAGE. α1I3 or α1I3•α1-m, prior to and after proteinase treatment, were applied to the transverse urea gradient gels. Native α1I3 migrated more slowly in the presence of increasing concentrations of urea (Fig. 5A). After treatment with the proteinase PPE, the migration of α1I3 was independent of the urea concentration (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the conformation of native α1I3 is less stable than proteinase-treated α1I3, a characteristic trait of proteinase inhibitors of the α-macroglobulin family (Barrett et al., 1979). On the other hand, the migration of both native and proteinase-treated α1I3•α1-m was urea concentration dependent (Fig. 5A). This suggests that the conformations of native α1I3 and α1I3•α1-m are similar and that the conformation of α1I3•α1-m is not affected by proteinase treatment, most likely due to an inability of the enzyme to cleave the complex, as suggested above. Finally, no major difference between α1I3 and the α1I3•α1-m complex could be seen by electron microscopy. Both appeared as rounded molecules containing granular structures, suggesting the presence of intramolecular domains in both α1I3 and the α1I3•α1-m complex. In this work, the α1I3•α1-m complex was purified from rat plasma, and its proteinase inhibitory activities and some structural properties were compared with those of free α1I3, the rat α2-macroglobulin homologue. The results demonstrate that the proteinase inhibitory activity of α1I3•α1-m is lost and its thiolester bond broken, and it was cleared from the circulation almost as quickly as proteinase-cleaved α1I3. However, the structure of the α1I3•α1-m complex, both before and after proteinase treatment, is similar to native α1I3 rather than proteinase-cleaved α1I3. The α1I3•α1-m complex lacked the proteinase inhibitory activity associated with α1I3. Two observations can explain this finding. First, proteinases were unable to cleave the peptide backbone at the bait region of α1I3•α1-m (Fig. 2). As a result, there was no conformational shift of the α1I3•α1-m molecule (Fig. 5), which has previously been demonstrated to be the result of proteinase treatment of α1I3 (Enghild et al., 1989a). It can be speculated that α1-m is bound closely to the bait region of the α1I3 peptide, sterically blocking the attack of the proteinase. Second, methylamine was not incorporated into α1I3•α1-m as it was into α1I3 (Fig. 3). This indicates that the thiolester bond of α1I3•α1-m is cleaved, making the complex unable to bind proteinases covalently via the glutamyl residue of the thiolester (see also Fig. 1). As a result, there can be no covalent binding of the attacking proteinase by α1I3•α1-m, which has been shown to be prerequisite for the efficient proteinase inhibition of α1I3 (Enghild et al., 1989a). The thiolester of native α-macroglobulins is believed to be hidden in a pocket that is too small for large molecules to enter (Barrett et al., 1979). The conformational shift induced by proteinase cleavage of the bait region leads to exposure of the thiolester, followed by a nucleophilic attack on the thiolester by a lysyl ∊-amino group on the nearby located proteinase, and a subsequent Glu-Lys cross-linking of α1I3 and the proteinase. However, the thiolester of the α1I3•α1-m complex is apparently cleaved, but since the conformation of the α1I3•α1-m complex is similar to native α1I3, it is not likely that the thiolester has reacted with a proteinase. Instead, the thiolester could have reacted with a small nucleophilic molecule, such as methylamine, or with a structure on the α1-m molecule that somehow can reach the thiolester bond without disrupting the conformation of the native α1I3. Consequently, it is possible that α1-m is cross-linked to α1I3 via the glutamyl or thiol group involved in the thiolester bond. α1-m is not dissociated from the α1I3•α1-m complex by extensive boiling in the presence of reducing agents. 2C. Falkenberg, J. J. Enghild, I. B. Th⊘gersen, G. Salvesen, and B. Åkerström, unpublished observations. This suggests that if the two proteins are cross-linked by a disulfide bond, it is most likely of an unusual type as in the IgA•α1-m complex in human plasma, which is also reduction resistant (Calero et al., 1994). The nature of the bond between α1-m and α1I3 is the subject of present investigations at our laboratories. Cleavage of α1I3 by proteinases ultimately leads to an exposure of receptor-binding domains, and a rapid clearance of the proteinase-α1I3 complex from the circulation (Enghild et al., 1989a). In agreement with this, the half-life of trypsin-treated α1I3 was approximately 2 min (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, the α1I3•α1-m complex was also rapidly cleared, with a half-life of approximately 7 min in the mouse blood circulation. Trypsin treatment of α1I3•α1-m did not, as expected from the inability of the proteinase to induce conformational changes in the complex, further increase the clearance rate. Thus, despite the intact peptide backbone of α1I3•α1-m, its insusceptibility to bait region proteinase attacks, and the structural similarity between α1I3•α1-m and native α1I3, it is possible that the receptor-binding domain of the α1I3•α1-m complex is exposed, resulting in a rapid clearing of the complex. The clearance of α1I3•α1-m could be inhibited by an excess of α2M, suggesting that it is in fact cleared by the same receptors that normally bind proteinase-cleaved α1I3 and not by receptors with affinity for α1-m or new epitopes formed by the complex binding of α1-m and α1I3. 3α2M was used instead of α1I3 for blocking of the in vivo clearance of α1I3•α1-m. It has been shown previously that α-macroglobulins, including α2M and α1I3, are bound by the same receptor on cultured macrophages and hepatocytes (Gliemann and Sottrup-Jensen, 1987; Enghild et al., 1989b). The α1I3•α1-m complex is found at a relatively high and stable concentration in rat plasma. Thus, to match the rapid elimination from the circulation, the complex must be synthesized at a comparable rate. It has been shown previously that, although rat hepatocytes synthesize both α1-m and α1I3, the complex is not synthesized at all or at a very low rate by rat hepatocytes (Pierzchalski et al., 1992). Moreover, a simple mixing and incubation of 125I-labeled α1-m with rat plasma or injection of 125I-labeled α1-m into living rats do not lead to the formation of 125I-labeled α1I3•α1-m (Falkenberg et al., 1994). Thus, despite a high rate of synthesis of the α1I3•α1-m complex, the site of formation of the complex is still unknown. The consequences of complex formation between α1I3 and α1-m are at present unknown. Complex formation may serve to regulate α1-m immunoregulatory activity. Recently, we have shown that covalent complexes of rat or human α-macroglobulins with lysozyme seem to augment antigen presentation of lysozyme by macrophages to T-cells (Chu and Pizzo, 1993; Chu et al., 1994). The α-macroglobulin-lysozyme covalent complexes were taken up very efficiently by macrophages via the low density lipoprotein-related protein-α2M receptor and then processed to present lysozyme peptides in complex with Ia antigen to T-cells that recognized the epitope. Whether uptake of α1-m via the low density lipoprotein-related protein-α2M receptor serves a functional role in macrophage regulation will require further study. It has been shown in this work that α1I3, the most abundant proteinase inhibitor in the rat, has lost its proteinase inhibitory activity when it is complex-bound to α1-m. Furthermore, α1I3•α1-m is cleared from the blood circulation at an unexpectedly high rate. A function of α1-m could be to “kill”α1I3 by blocking the inhibitory activity and to cause its physical elimination from the circulation. Indeed, it can be speculated that α1-m “kills” its various complex partners, i.e. albumin, fibronectin, and IgA, by blocking one or more of their effector functions. It has, for example, been shown that α1-m is linked to IgA via the C-terminal part of the α-chain (Grubb et al., 1986), which is also involved in the binding to the secretory component (Mestecky and McGhee, 1987), potentially blocking the transport of IgA from blood to secretions. Thus, a scenario linking these observations would be for α1-m to rapidly down-regulate the activity of plasma proteins that are already in circulation before their concentration can be lowered by transcriptional down-regulation.

https://openalex.org/W1972067409,"The epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb19) directed against the β2 subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase was found to be carried by residues 2-9 of the β chain. The affinities of mAb19 for peptides of different lengths containing the 2-9 sequence were close to 0.6 × 109M−, the affinity of mAb19 for native β2. In view of these results, a model is proposed to account for the kinetics of appearance of the epitope during in vitro renaturation of β2 (Murry-Brelier, A., and Goldberg, M. E.(1988) Biochemistry 27, 7633-7640). A mutant producing β chains lacking residues 1-9 (βΔ1–9) was prepared. The βΔ1–9 protein was able to fold into a heat stable homodimer resembling wild type β2. Isolated βΔ1–9 had no detectable enzymatic activity. It could bind α chains extremely weakly and be slightly activated. In the presence of the 1-9 peptide, the βΔ1–9 protein could bind α chains much more strongly and generate a 50% active enzyme. Thus, although having little role in the overall folding and stability of the protein, the 1-9 sequence of the β chain appears strongly involved in the α-β interactions and in the enzymatic activity. The epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb19) directed against the β2 subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase was found to be carried by residues 2-9 of the β chain. The affinities of mAb19 for peptides of different lengths containing the 2-9 sequence were close to 0.6 × 109M−, the affinity of mAb19 for native β2. In view of these results, a model is proposed to account for the kinetics of appearance of the epitope during in vitro renaturation of β2 (Murry-Brelier, A., and Goldberg, M. E.(1988) Biochemistry 27, 7633-7640). A mutant producing β chains lacking residues 1-9 (βΔ1–9) was prepared. The βΔ1–9 protein was able to fold into a heat stable homodimer resembling wild type β2. Isolated βΔ1–9 had no detectable enzymatic activity. It could bind α chains extremely weakly and be slightly activated. In the presence of the 1-9 peptide, the βΔ1–9 protein could bind α chains much more strongly and generate a 50% active enzyme. Thus, although having little role in the overall folding and stability of the protein, the 1-9 sequence of the β chain appears strongly involved in the α-β interactions and in the enzymatic activity. INTRODUCTIONIn an attempt to use monoclonal antibodies as conformational probes to investigate the structure, conformational changes, conformational dynamics, and folding pathway of proteins, we have prepared a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against different proteins and developed a variety of experimental methods for the quantitative analysis of antigen-antibody interactions(1Goldberg M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 358-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For most of these studies, the model protein we used was the β2 1The abbreviations used are: β2, F1, F2, and β, β2 subunitthe N- and C-terminal proteolytic domains, and the polypeptide chain, respectively, of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assaymAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRIAradioimmunoassayCHAPS3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase. The properties of this enzyme have been recently reviewed in detail(2Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 93-172PubMed Google Scholar). We shall summarize here those which are directly relevant to the present study. The natural form of tryptophan synthase is the heterotetramer α2β2, which can be readily dissociated into monomeric α chains and the dimeric β2 subunit. The β2 subunit can, in the presence of its coenzyme pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, catalyze two distinct reactions: indole + L-serine → L-tryptophan + H2O and L-serine + H2O → pyruvate + ammonia.In the presence of α chains, the serine deaminase reaction is completely abolished, while the specific activity of β2 in the tryptophan synthase reaction is increased by a factor about 30. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme from Salmonella typhimurium has been solved(3Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the very strong amino acid sequence homology between the enzymes from E. coli and S. typhimurium, there is no doubt that the three-dimensional structures of both enzymes also must be extremely similar. The in vitro refolding of denatured β chains to regenerate native β2 subunits has been extensively investigated(4Goldberg M.E. Semisotnov G.V. Friguet B. Kuwajima K. Ptitsyn O.B. Sugai S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In particular, one monoclonal antibody, mAb19, turned out to detect an early folding step during the in vitro renaturation of β2(5Murry-Brelier A. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7633-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Blond-Elguindi S. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2409-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was shown that the specific epitope was not recognized by mAb19 at early stages of the folding process and became immunoreactive as a result of a folding step with a kinetic constant of 0.06 s− at 12°C(5Murry-Brelier A. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7633-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This intramolecular reaction occurs early on the folding pathway, at a stage where the protein is still a molten globule(4Goldberg M.E. Semisotnov G.V. Friguet B. Kuwajima K. Ptitsyn O.B. Sugai S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the affinity of mAb19 for the early folding intermediate was shown to be of the same order of magnitude as that of mAb19 for the native protein(5Murry-Brelier A. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7633-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This suggested that the conformation of the epitope was the same in the early intermediate as it is in the native protein. It seemed of interest to understand in more detail the nature of the folding step(s) detected by mAb19, and for that purpose to characterize as precisely as possible the epitope recognized by this antibody.The present report describes experiments aimed at identifying the residues involved in the antigenic site recognized by mAb19 and at assessing their role in the folding, stability, association with α chains, and enzymatic activity of the β2 subunit.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents and BufferThe standard buffer used was 0.1 M potassium phosphate at pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol.For Western blots, the buffer was TBS (0.05 M Tris base, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2).Protein and Proteolytic FragmentThe native β2 subunit of E. coli tryptophan synthase was prepared and cleaved with trypsin, and the resulting N-terminal F1 and C-terminal F2 fragments were separated by heat denaturation as described previously(7Högberg-Raibaud A. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4014-4020Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The solubilized F1 fragment was purified by gel filtration on a S-200HR Sephacryl column equilibrated with standard buffer. The concentrations of β2 and of F1 were determined spectrophotometrically using specific extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 0.58 and 0.67 cm2/mg, respectively. The enzymatic activity of the β2 subunit was measured in the indole to tryptophan reaction, either in the presence or in the absence of α subunit, as described previously (8Faeder E.J. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1970; 25: 4043-4049Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and in the serine deamination reaction(9Crawford I.P. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 391-397Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Monoclonal antibodies were obtained (10Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Friguet B. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and purified from ascitic fluids (11Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. Res. Immunol. 1989; 140: 355-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) as described earlier. Their concentration, expressed in terms of binding sites, was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm, using the standard value of 1.5 cm2/mg (12Onoue K. Yagi Y. Grossberg A.L. Pressman D. Immunochemistry. 1965; 2: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as specific extinction coefficient. For affinity measurements with the radioactivity assay, the mAb19 solution was titrated as described earlier(13Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar).The polypeptide 1-102 was prepared (14Fedorov A.N. Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Alakhov Y.B. Goldberg M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and kindly supplied by Dr. Alexei Fedorov.Epitope Library Construction, Screening, and CharacterizationThe epitope library was constructed, screened for clones expressing the epitope of mAb19, and the nucleotide sequence at the beginning of each insert as well as its length were determined as described by Friguet et al.(15Friguet B. Fedorov A.N. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 158: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).Cyanogen Bromide Cleavage of F1The lyophilized F1 fragment (40 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 70% formic acid, 100 mg (a 20-fold molar excess over F1) of cyanogen bromide were added, and the resulting solution was incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature. The mixture was then diluted 10-fold with water and lyophilized.Chemical Synthesis of PeptidesPeptides were synthesized by the Merrifield (16Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6610) Google Scholar) solid-phase method using an Applied 430 synthesizer. They were purified by gel filtration and preparative C18 reverse phase HPLC, lyophilized, and stored at 4°C. The final purity of the peptides (>98%) was checked by analytical C18 reverse phase HPLC. Amino acid composition was determined on a Beckman 6300 Amino Acid Analyzer after 6 N HCl hydrolysis. The extinction coefficients at 280 nm of the peptides were estimated from their tyrosine content, using an extinction coefficient of 1420 M− cm− for tyrosine at pH 6.Site-directed MutagenesisStop codons or deletions were introduced in the trpB gene by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis(17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar, 18Messing J. Vieira J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). A derivative of the plasmid pTZ19R, carrying the sequence coding for the first 102 amino acids of the tryptophan synthase β subunit(19Friguet B. Fedorov A.N. Serganov A.A. Navon A. Goldberg M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), was used for the introduction of stop codons and of the 15-21 deletion in the 1-102 peptide. For the introduction of the 2-9 deletion in the complete β chain, the plasmid used was derived from pαβTS21 (a plasmid containing the trpA and trpB genes, constructed by Dr. Carlos Zetina) by excising the fragment containing the B gene with ClaI and inserting it at the ClaI site of the Bluescript KS-. The single-stranded DNA of the plasmids was prepared by infection of the E. coli strain RZ1032, used as a cellular host, by helper phage M13-K07(17Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar, 18Messing J. Vieira J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). The single strand DNA of the pTZ19R derivative was used to introduce a stop codon at five different places (after codons 39, 50, 60, 69, and 79) or to construct the 15-21 deletion and the Bluescript derivative to construct the 2-9 deletion, using appropriate primers. The construction of the different stop codons resulted in the introduction of a new unique AflII restriction site, that of the 2-9 deletion introduced a new BamHI site, and the 15-21 deletion resulted in the loss of a RsaI site. After analysis of a few clones from each mutation, the clones with the correct restriction pattern were subjected to automated sequence analysis in an Applied Biosystem sequencer, using T7 and T3 primers and the dye termination method.RNA PreparationThe different plasmids were prepared as a “mini-prep” or in “large scale”(20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 2 μg of the plasmid of interest were linearized with EcoRI, phenol extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. The precipitate was washed with 70% ethanol, vacuum dried, and then used for in vitro transcription from the T7 promoter(20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An aliquot of the newly transcribed RNA was loaded on a 2% agarose gel in order to verify the quality of the RNA.In Vitro TranslationAll translation reactions were done using a wheat germ in vitro translation lysate (Promega). As a preliminary step, the optimum potassium acetate concentration was determined for each mRNA and was found to be 73 mM for all mRNAs, except for that coding the 39 residue fragment for which it was 93 mM. All reactions were performed in a final volume of 25 μl. A typical reaction mixture contained 1 μg of RNA, 1 μl of Rnasin (54,000 units/ml), 0.5 μl of 1 M potassium acetate, 2 μl of amino acid solution (1 mM of each amino acid except methionine), 1 μl of [35S]methionine (Amersham 1000 Ci/mmol), 12.5 μl of wheat germ lysate, and 8 μl of water. The translation was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 25°C. In order to check the efficiency of the translation and estimate the amount of peptides produced in each translation mixture, 1-μl aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE, after which the gel was stained, destained, dried, and subjected to quantitative radioactivity scanning in a β-Imager (Biospace, Paris,) until about half a million counts were recorded. Integrating the counts for each fragment by means of the β-Imager software, and comparing with a control sticker of known radioactivity, provided an estimate of the amount of the desired peptide in each preparation.Gel ElectrophoresisElectrophoresis of the cyanogen bromide peptides was performed either with the Phast System (Pharmacia) using homogeneous SDS 20 gels, or according to Schägger and von Jagow (21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). The molecular weight markers used were from the 2350-46000 Da kit (Amersham).For analysis of peptides produced by in vitro translation, a logarithmic 10-27% acrylamide gradient was used(22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar).ElectrotransferThe cyanogen bromide peptides were transferred onto Problott membranes (Applied Biosystems) by applying 50 V for 30 min at room temperature. The buffer used was 10 mM CHAPS at pH 11 in 10% methanol.The peptides produced by in vitro translation were transferred to nitro-cellulose membranes by electrotransfer at 200 milliamperes for 2 h(23Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5867) Google Scholar).MicrosequencingAfter staining with Amido Schwarz, the region of the membrane containing the desired band was cut with a razor blade, and three cycles of N-terminal sequence determination were carried out in an Applied Biosystem 470 gas-phase automatic sequencer. Phenylthiohydantoin amino acids were identified with an on-line Applied Biosystems 120A analyzer.Western BlotsThe membrane-bound peptides obtained by electrotransfer were immunodetected with mAb19 as follows. For the cyanogen bromide peptides, rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Biosys) were used and revealed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Sigma). For the peptides produced by in vitro translation, rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseraddish peroxidase were used and developed with the ECL reagents of Amersham according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure.Competition ELISAQuantification of wild type or truncated β2 subunits in crude extracts was made by a competition ELISA based on the test previously described(24Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Friguet B. Butler J.E. The Immunochemistry of Solid-phase Immunoassay. CRC Press Inc., Roca Baton, FL1991: 201-206Google Scholar). Briefly, the concentration range in which the absorbance obtained in the last step of the indirect ELISA is proportional to the amount of free antibody in solution was first determined. Then, the mAb, at a concentration near the upper limit of this range (2.5 × 10-10M) was incubated for 30 min with various dilutions of either the pure enzyme or the crude extract (wild type or mutant). The free antibody remaining in solution was then determined by indirect ELISA. Comparing the competition curve obtained with the crude extract with the standard curve obtained with pure β2 provided a quantitative estimate of the amount of enzyme in the extract. A similar competition assay was used to detect the relative amount of enzyme in the fractions obtained after gel filtration, using a 20-fold dilution of each fraction. The procedure for the indirect ELISA was as described previously(24Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Friguet B. Butler J.E. The Immunochemistry of Solid-phase Immunoassay. CRC Press Inc., Roca Baton, FL1991: 201-206Google Scholar).Affinity MeasurementsThey were made either by a competition ELISA method (13Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar) when pure antigen was available, or by a competition RIA method (19Friguet B. Fedorov A.N. Serganov A.A. Navon A. Goldberg M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) for antigens produced by in vitro cell-free synthesis.Circular DichroismCircular dichroism spectra were recorded in a CD6 spectrodichrograph (Jobin-Yvon, Longjumeau, France) using 0.1- or 0.2-mm optical path cells. The temperature was 20°C. The wavelength region scanned was between 193 and 255 nm. The spectral bandwidth was automatically kept at 2 nm. The wavelength increment was 1 nm/step and the accumulation time was 1 s/step. Each spectrum resulted from averaging five successive scans. The spectrum of the solvent alone was recorded under identical conditions and substracted from the sample spectrum to generate the CD spectrum of the peptide.RESULTSIn order to identify the region of the β chain that binds mAb19, 13 independent clones expressing recombinant peptides recognized by mAb19 were isolated from a gene library and their DNA was sequenced. All the polypeptides encoded by these clones had in common residues 1-85, which localized the epitope of mAb19 within the 85 first residues of the β chain. The N-terminal F1 fragment of the β chain was then submitted to cyanogen bromide cleavage and the resulting peptides analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Staining of the gel revealed a major peptide which, from its migration on the gel and its N-terminal sequence determined by microsequencing (Pro-Ala-Leu), was identified as the 23-101 peptide. This peptide did not give rise to any detectable reaction with mAb19, while peptide 1-102 distinctly reacted with mAb19 and not with a control antibody. These results suggested that the 1-22 sequence was essential for building up the epitope.Chemical Synthesis and Immunoreactivity of Synthetic PeptidesTo more precisely delineate the epitope, four peptides included in the 1-22 region were prepared by chemical synthesis, and their affinities for mAb19 were measured according to Friguet et al.(13Friguet B. Chaffotte A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 77: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). The results shown in Table 1 indicated that the shortest peptide recognized by mAb19 with an affinity close to that of the native protein was peptide 1-9. That peptide 2-22 also could bind mAb19 strongly showed that the N-terminal methionine of peptide 1-22 did not belong to the epitope. This is in line with the fact that, although its N-terminal methionine is cleaved off in vivo(25Crawford I.P. Decastel M. Goldberg M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) the native protein reacts well with mAb19. The minimal immunoreactive sequence thus defined therefore corresponded to residues 2-9 of the β chain. The affinity values obtained for all the synthetic peptides containing the 2-9 sequence were in the range of 0.1-0.3 × 109M− (see Table 1). These affinities are only slightly smaller than that (0.6 × 109M−) found for the native β2 subunit, strongly suggesting that the antigenic determinant of β2 recognized by mAb19 resides in the 2-9 sequence, and that the rest of the polypeptide chain might not contribute to the antigen-antibody recognition.Tabled 1Preparation and Characterization of Mutants with Deletions or Stop Codons in the tryp B GeneTo ascertain the latter conclusion a plasmid encoding a β chain lacking residues 2-9 was prepared, and the immunoreactivity of the corresponding truncated protein was investigated by Western blotting with mAb19. Fig. 1 shows that the protein carrying the 2-9 deletion had no detectable reactivity toward mAb19, while it reacted strongly with mAb164, an antibody directed against the sequence 273-283 of the β chain(26Larvor M.-P. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Friguet B. Baleux F. Goldberg M.E. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This confirmed that the 2-9 sequence is essential for the immunoreactivity of the β2 protein toward mAb19.Figure 1:Western blots of the β chain carrying the 2-9 deletion. Bacteria carrying the plasmid encoding the β chain, either complete or carrying the 2-9 deletion, were grown overnight in rich medium supplemented with ampicillin, washed, sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatants (15 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10-27% acrylamide gel, electrotransferred, and stained as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Left panel (A): Western blot with mAb19. Slot 1, β carrying the 2-9 deletion; slot 2, wild type β; slot 3, molecular weight markers. Right panel (B): Western blot with a specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes the sequence 273-283 of the β chain. Slot 4, β carrying the 2-9 deletion; slot 5, wild type β; slot 6, molecular mass (indicated in kDa) markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This raised the question of why screening of the epitope library did not pick up any immunoreactive clone expressing a protein that would end before residue 85. To test the possibility of a cloning artifact, recombinant plasmids carrying the trypB gene with stop codons at various places were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. The stop codons were introduced at positions such that polypeptide chains starting at position 1 and ending at positions 39, 50, 60, 69, and 79 should be produced. Two positive controls were used. One was a plasmid encoding the sequence 1-102(14Fedorov A.N. Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Alakhov Y.B. Goldberg M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The second was a plasmid encoding the 1-102 fragment with a deletion of residues 15-21. The latter plasmid thus encoded a 95 residue fragment (1-14.22-102) carrying the 2-9 immunoreactive sequence. The corresponding mRNAs were prepared and used as templates in a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system. The proteins produced were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Although considerably blurred by the presence of an endogenous antigen likely to be the wheat germ tryptophan synthase, the results obtained (not shown) clearly indicated that fragments extending from the N-terminal to anywhere between residues 39 and 79 of the β chain could not be detected in the Western blots with mAb19 as performed here. On the contrary, longer fragments containing the intact N-terminal sequence of β could clearly be seen. Thus, rather than a cloning artifact, the failure to detect shorter immunoreactive fragments in the epitope library seemed to be due to a screening artifact.To find out whether this screening artifact was due to an abnormal interaction of the short peptides with the membrane onto which they were blotted, or to a particular conformation that short peptides might adopt and that would render the epitope unreactive, peptides labeled with [35S]methionine were synthesized in vitro as above, using mRNA with the various stop codons as templates, and their interaction with mAb19 (10-8M) in solution was investigated by competition RIA(12Onoue K. Yagi Y. Grossberg A.L. Pressman D. Immunochemistry. 1965; 2: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The qualitative results of this experiment indicated that, in solution, all the peptides investigated (starting at position 1 and ending at positions 39, 50, 60, 69, and 79, respectively) reacted strongly with mAb19. This was quantitatively verified by measuring the affinities of mAb19 for the peptides 1-60 and 1-102 in solution, using the competition RIA method(12Onoue K. Yagi Y. Grossberg A.L. Pressman D. Immunochemistry. 1965; 2: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity obtained with peptide 1-60 from the data shown in Fig. 2 was 0.75 × 109 and a very similar value (0.7 × 109M−) was obtained with fragment 1-102 (Table 1). Thus, while the antigenic determinant of the 1-60 fragment was not detected by Western blotting, in solution it was recognized by mAb19 in the 1-60 fragment as well as in the 1-102 fragment. Moreover, the values found for the affinities were only slightly smaller than that reported above for the 2-9 peptide and very close to that observed previously for native β2(14Fedorov A.N. Friguet B. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Alakhov Y.B. Goldberg M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This indicated that residues 2-9 did not adopt an abnormal conformation in the short peptides obtained in solution after in vitro cell-free synthesis. Thus, the apparently poor reactivity of the short peptides when immobilized on membranes seemed to result primarily from an artifact in their immunodetection with mAb19 on the blots, showing that care should be taken in interpreting Western blots when negative results are obtained.Figure 2:Determination of the affinity of mAb19 for the fragment 1-60. The 35S-labeled peptide 1-60 was synthesized in a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis extract. 2 μl of the synthesis mixture were diluted in 50 μl of standard buffer supplemented with 10 μl of caseine (1 mg/ml solution filtered on a 0.45-μm Millipore filter) and 1-3 μl of various dilutions of mAb19 to obtain the desired antibody concentration. This mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4°C, and 40 μl of a suspension of Sepharose beads coupled to mAb19 and saturated with casein were added, incubated for 5 min with gentle shaking, centrifuged, and washed. The immunoadsorbed proteins were dissolved, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the amount of radioactive fragment in each slot was determined by scanning in a β-Imager as described by Friguet et al.(19Friguet B. Fedorov A.N. Serganov A.A. Navon A. Goldberg M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A, bidimensional scan for the gel with fragment 1-60. Slot 1, molecular weight markers; the mAb19 concentrations in the mixtures were as follows. Slot 2, 0; slot 3, 2.3 × 10-10M; slot 4, 6.8 × 10-10M; slot 5, 2.3 × 10-9M; slot 6, 6.8 × 10-9M; slot 7, 2.3 × 10-8M; slot 8, 6.8 × 10-8M. B, the total radioactivity contained in each band at the position of fragment 1-60 in the diagram in panel A was obtained by use of the β-Imager software, and the data obtained were plotted as described by Friguet et al.(19Friguet B. Fedorov A.N. Serganov A.A. Navon A. Goldberg M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The experimental points were fitted to a straight line by linear regression. The slope of this line provides the equilibrium dissociation constant (see Table 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Far UV Circular Dichroism of the 1-9 Antigenic PeptideIn an attempt to characterize the conformation of the immunoreactive isolated antigenic 1-9 nonapeptide, the far UV CD spectrum of a 0.1 mg/ml solution of the peptide was recorded. The spectrum obtained was quite atypical, mainly in the region below 200 nm where the residue ellipticity was particularly low (about −12,000 deg•cm-2•dmol−). Such a spectrum could by no means be generated by a random conformation or by any of the classical secondary structures of a polypeptide backbone. Moreover, the amplitude of the mean residue ellipticity increased with the peptide concentration. This suggested that aggregates are responsible for the abnormal far UV CD spectrum, thus precluding any reliable conclusion to be made concerning the conformation of the isolated nonapeptide at the much lower concentrations used for affinity measurements.Expressi"
