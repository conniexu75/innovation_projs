https://openalex.org/W2056380135,"Desert varnish has been characterized by infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and electron microscopy. It is a distinct morphological entity having an abrupt boundary with the underlying rock. Clay minerals comprise more than 70 percent of the varnish. Iron and manganese oxides constitute the bulk of the remainder and are dispersed throughout the clay layer."

https://openalex.org/W2050664154,"A 400-square-kilometer depression in the continental slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico (approximately 27 degrees N, 91 degrees W) has been found to contain anoxic, hypersaline ( approximately 250 grams per kilogram) water in the bottom 200 meters. The interface between the brine and overlying seawater acts as a midwater seismic reflector similar to those seen in the Red Sea. The bulk chemical composition of the brine is similar to that from the Red Sea, but differences between the two in both heat content and geomorphological setting indicate different modes of origin."
https://openalex.org/W1980387298,"Pairs of females that remain together from one year to the next are associated with the presence of supernormal clutches in western gull nests. Intervals between laying of eggs in supernormal clutches are less than those found in normal clutches, a result indicating both females in a pair contribute to the clutch. Most eggs in supernormal clutches are infertile. The pairs of females occupy territories that are not shared with a resident male. In three homosexual pairs one of the females exhibited behaviors normally ascribed only to males."

However, because large areas of their drainage basins are devoted to agriculture or are urbanized, western Lake Erie, lower Green Bay, and Saginaw Bay may require non-point source controls to effect significant improvements in their trophic status."
https://openalex.org/W2079797766,"By genetic selection a gypsy moth strain was obtained within eight generations that could be reared continuously in the insectary without its normal ""obligatory"" diapause. This strain should be useful for making physiological and genetical comparisons with normal diapausing gypsy moths. It could also be used in a genetic control program. However, caution should be exercised, for its release could create a new environmental hazard."
https://openalex.org/W1968756627,"In a first electrophysiological study of worm vision, electroretinograms were measured in two alciopid worms: Torrea, taken at the surface, and deep-sea Vanadis. Both forms possess a primary retina in the focal plane of the lens, and accessory retinas lying beside the lens. Such accessory retinas occur also in deep sea fishes and cephalopods. In Torrea the primary retina peaks in sensitivity at 400 nanometers, the secondary retina at 560 nanometers. Both together could serve as a depth guage, since 560 nanometers attenuates much faster in seawater than 400 nanometers. The Vanadis eyes peaked in sensitivity at 460 to 480 nanometers, a property shared with deep-sea forms of other phyla; and appropriate, since these wavelengths penetrate seawater most deeply, and also are the wavelengths of maximum bioluminescence."

https://openalex.org/W2042175803,"One natural population of fire ant in Texas was found to be a hybrid between Solenopsis geminata and S. xyloni. Evidence from isozyme studies and breeding experiments is provided to demonstrate interspecific hybridization in ants. In this hybrid population, all worker ants have both parental types of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-malate dehydrogenase isozymes, but 95 percent of queens possess only the maternal type."

https://openalex.org/W2001186780,"To condense the evolution of life on Earth . . . suppose the whole history of the planet is contained within a single year. The conditions suitable for life do not develop until late June. The oldest known fossils are living creatures around mid-October, and life is abundant . . . by the end of that month. In mid-December, dinosaurs and other reptiles dominate the scene. Mammals . . . appear in large numbers only a little before Christmas. On New Year's Eve, at about five minutes to midnight, man emerges. . . . The period since 1600 A.D., when man-induced extinction began to increase rapidly, amounts to three seconds, and the quarter century just begun, when the disappearance of species may be on the scale of all the mass extinctions of the past put together, will take another sixth of a second-a twinkling of an eye in evolutionary time."
