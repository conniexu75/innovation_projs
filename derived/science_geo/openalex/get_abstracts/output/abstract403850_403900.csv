https://openalex.org/W2055638681,"In recent years, numerous large-scale seawater desalination plants have been built in water-stressed countries to augment available water resources, and construction of new desalination plants is expected to increase in the near future. Despite major advancements in desalination technologies, seawater desalination is still more energy intensive compared to conventional technologies for the treatment of fresh water. There are also concerns about the potential environmental impacts of large-scale seawater desalination plants. Here, we review the possible reductions in energy demand by state-of-the-art seawater desalination technologies, the potential role of advanced materials and innovative technologies in improving performance, and the sustainability of desalination as a technological solution to global water shortages."

https://openalex.org/W2022064821,"Oligodendrogliomas are the second most common malignant brain tumor in adults and exhibit characteristic losses of chromosomes 1p and 19q. To identify the molecular genetic basis for this alteration, we performed exomic sequencing of seven tumors. Among other changes, we found that the CIC gene (homolog of the Drosophila gene capicua) on chromosome 19q was somatically mutated in six cases and that the FUBP1 gene [encoding far-upstream element (FUSE) binding protein] on chromosome 1p was somatically mutated in two tumors. Examination of 27 additional oligodendrogliomas revealed 12 and 3 more tumors with mutations of CIC and FUBP1, respectively, 58% of which were predicted to result in truncations of the encoded proteins. These results suggest a critical role for these genes in the biology and pathology of oligodendrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2145534945,"The Tet family of enzymes (Tet1/2/3) converts 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) highly express Tet1 and have an elevated level of 5hmC. Tet1 has been implicated in ESC maintenance and lineage specification in vitro but its precise function in development is not well defined. To establish the role of Tet1 in pluripotency and development, we have generated Tet1 mutant mESCs and mice. Tet1(-/-) ESCs have reduced levels of 5hmC and subtle changes in global gene expression, and are pluripotent and support development of live-born mice in tetraploid complementation assay, but display skewed differentiation toward trophectoderm in vitro. Tet1 mutant mice are viable, fertile, and grossly normal, though some mutant mice have a slightly smaller body size at birth. Our data suggest that Tet1 loss leading to a partial reduction in 5hmC levels does not affect pluripotency in ESCs and is compatible with embryonic and postnatal development."

https://openalex.org/W2145657661,"In a small-scale reaction, vanadium-dependent nitrogenase has previously been shown to catalyze reductive catenation of carbon monoxide (CO) to ethylene, ethane, propylene, and propane. Here, we report the identification of additional hydrocarbon products [α-butylene, n-butane, and methane (CH(4))] in a scaled-up reaction featuring 20 milligrams of vanadium-iron protein, the catalytic component of vanadium nitrogenase. Additionally, we show that the more common molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase can generate the same hydrocarbons from CO, although CH(4) was not detected. The identification of CO as a substrate for both molybdenum- and vanadium-nitrogenases strengthens the hypothesis that CO reduction is an evolutionary relic of the function of the nitrogenase family. Moreover, the comparison between the CO-reducing capacities of the two nitrogenases suggests that the identity of heterometal at the active cofactor site affects the efficiency and product distribution of this reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2072393294,"Measurement of coupled quantum systems plays a central role in quantum information processing. We have realized independent single-shot read-out of two electron spins in a double quantum dot. The read-out method is all-electrical, cross-talk between the two measurements is negligible, and read-out fidelities are ~86% on average. This allows us to directly probe the anticorrelations between two spins prepared in a singlet state and to demonstrate the operation of the two-qubit exchange gate on a complete set of basis states. The results provide a possible route to the realization and efficient characterization of multiqubit quantum circuits based on single quantum dot spins."

https://openalex.org/W2016999017,"Recent studies have implicated a poorly defined alternative pathway of nonhomologous end joining (alt-NHEJ) in the generation of large deletions and chromosomal translocations that are frequently observed in cancer cells. Here, we describe an interaction between two factors, hMre11/hRad50/Nbs1 (MRN) and DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1, that have been linked with alt-NHEJ. Expression of DNA ligase IIIα and the association between MRN and DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 are altered in cell lines defective in the major NHEJ pathway. Most notably, DNA damage induced the association of these factors in DNA ligase IV-deficient cells. MRN interacts with DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1, stimulating intermolecular ligation, and together these proteins join incompatible DNA ends in a reaction that mimics alt-NHEJ. Thus, our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the alt-NHEJ pathway that not only contributes to genome instability in cancer cells but may also be a therapeutic target.

Notably, defects in DSB repair result in genomic rearrangements that promote cancer formation and progression (1Venkitaraman A.R.

Although there are multiple DSB repair pathways, these pathways can be divided into two groups depending on whether the repair reaction is dependent or not upon substantial DNA sequence homology between the recombining molecules (4Lieber M.R.

The key step of the major homology-dependent pathway is the invasion of a single strand into a homologous duplex. In contrast, the key step of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) involves the end-to-end alignment of broken DNA molecules (4Lieber M.R. J. Biol.

Unlike the major homology-dependent pathway, repair of DSBs by the major or classic NHEJ (C-NHEJ) pathway is error-prone, frequently resulting in the loss or addition of a few nucleotides at the break site (4Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 5Weterings E. Chen D.J. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 114-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Despite the mutagenic consequences of NHEJ, this is a major DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells. In addition, there is emerging evidence for alternative versions of NHEJ (alt-NHEJs) that are more error-prone than C-NHEJ. Although alt-NHEJ is more evident in cells that are deficient in C-NHEJ (6Soulas-Sprauel P. Le Guyader G. Rivera-Munoz P. Abramowski V. Olivier-Martin C. Goujet-Zalc C. Charneau P. de Villartay J.P.

Repair of DSBs by alt-NHEJ is characterized by the presence of short tracts of sequence homology (microhomologies) at the repair site, large deletions, and chromosome translocations (6Soulas-Sprauel P.

In contrast, the factors involved in and the mechanisms of alt-NHEJ are not well defined. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), the initiating protein for DNA single-strand break (SSB) repair, also binds to DSBs (16Ikejima M. Noguchi S. Yamashita R. Ogura T. Sugimura T. Gill D.M.

In this study, we demonstrate that DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 and MRN are constitutively associated in undamaged wild-type cells but dissociate in response to DNA damage. However, in cell lines that are defective in C-NHEJ, the steady-state levels of DNA ligase IIIα are elevated, and the association between DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 and MRN is abnormal, suggesting that these factors act together in alt-NHEJ. In support of this idea, we show that DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 and MRN physically and functionally interact to join DNA ends in a reaction that mimics alt-NHEJ. The human pre-B cell line Nalm6 and its lig4-null derivative N114P2 were cultured as described (29Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol.

When indicated, cells were preincubated for 30 min with the DNA PK inhibitor LY294,002 (200 μm; Sigma). Cells (1–3 × 107) were either mock treated or irradiated (10 grays) and then allowed to recover for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (32Vijayakumar S. Dziegielewska B.

After washing, bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer and detected by immunoblotting after separation by SDS-PAGE. To detect multiple proteins, membranes were stripped in PBS containing 2% SDS and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min, washed with PBS for 30 min, and reprobed with a different antibody. The hMre11 mutant H129L/D130V was made in pTP813 (33Lee J.H. Goodarzi A.A. Jeggo P.A. Paull T.T.

In similar assays, GST-DNA ligase IIIβ and GST beads were incubated with truncated derivatives of Nbs1 lacking either the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain or BRCT domain that had been labeled by coupled in vitro transcription and translation (TNT7 kit; Promega). Labeled polypeptides retained by the GST beads were detected by phosphorimaging after separation by SDS-PAGE. Full-length versions of DNA ligase IIIα and DNA ligase IIIβ (38Mackey Z.B. Ramos W.

Full-length Nbs1 and truncated versions lacking either the BRCT domain alone or both the FHA and BRCT domains, and a version containing only the FHA domain were subcloned into the plasmid pGADT7 to generate GAL4 activation domain fusion proteins. Derivatives of pGBK and pGADT7 were transformed individually into the isogenic haploid yeast strains PJ69-4α and PJ69-4a, respectively. Protein-protein interactions were screened as described previously (39Krejci L. Damborsky J. Thomsen B. Duno M. Bendixen C. Mol. Cell.

Full-length versions of DNA ligase IIIα and XRCC1 were subcloned into the plasmid pFastBac to generate the plasmids pFastBac-LigIIIα and pFastBac-XRCC1. After verification by DNA sequencing, the pFastBac plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli DH10Bac cells containing the bacmid (Invitrogen) to generate baculoviruses encoding either DNA ligase IIIα or XRCC1. Suspension cultures of SF9 insect cells (0.9 liter) were co-infected with the DNA ligase IIIα and XRCC1 baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 and 20:1, respectively. Cells were harvested 72 h after infection and, after resuspension in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Igepal CA-630 containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, lysed by sonication. The DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 complex was purified from the clarified extract by sequential phosphocellulose, Hi-Trap SP-Sepharose, Superdex 200, Mono Q, and Mono S (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography steps. Approximately 1 mg of >98% homogeneous DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 was obtained from the 0.9-liter culture. DNA concentrations are expressed as DNA ends. A linear duplex DNA fragment (580 bp) with 3′-complementary single-strand ends was generated by digestion of the pGADT7 vector (Clontech) with PstI. Ligation reactions were carried out using 2 pmol of substrate, 400 fmol to 1.6 pmol of DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1, and 400 fmol, 800 fmol, and 1.2 pmol of MRN as indicated, in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 50 μg/ml BSA at 30 °C for 1 h. After incubation with proteinase K at 37 °C for 1 h, DNA molecules in the reactions were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and then stained with ethidium bromide. Ligation was quantified using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Longer DNA substrates were made by digesting pCDF-1b plasmid (Novagen) with PstI to generate a 3621-bp substrate with 3′-complementary single-strand ends or with BglI and EcoNI to generate a 2915-bp substrate with incompatible, nonpalindromic ends. The ligation reaction was performed in a 10-μl mixture containing 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NaCl, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml BSA, DNA substrate (16 fmol for compatible DNA substrate, 20 fmol for incompatible DNA substrate), and the indicated protein. The mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 (1.4 fmol for compatible DNA substrate, 180 fmol for incompatible DNA substrate) and further incubation at 37 °C for 10 min (compatible DNA) or 30 min (incompatible DNA). The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 2% SDS, 100 mm EDTA and deproteinized with proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min. The samples were then used for electrophoresis on a 0.7% native agarose gel. DNA was visualized using SYBR Green (Invitrogen) on a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare), and the ligation products were quantified using ImageQuant TL version 2005 software. Linear DNA molecules were generated by digestion of pGADT7 (Invitrogen) with BamHI and EcoRI for the four nucleotide 5′ overhangs and of pcDNA4HisMax C (Invitrogen) with KpnI and PstI for the four nucleotide 3′ overhangs. Intramolecular joining of the incompatible ends was carried out in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 60 mm KCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 2 mm DTT, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.8 pmol of plasmid DNA, 10% polyethylene glycol, 0.01 pmol of DNA ligase III/XRCC1 or DNA ligase IV/XRCC4, and 0.06 pmol of hMre11 or MRN as indicated, in a volume of 10 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 25 min, Tween 20 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and a 2.5-μl aliquot was amplified by PCR using the MATCHMAKER 5′ and 3′ AD LD-Insert Screening Amplimers (20 ng; Clontech) and Pfu DNA polymerase (0.5 unit; Stratagene) in a 20 μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl of 10 × Cloned Pfu DNA Polymerase buffer (Stratagene) and dNTPs (200 μm each). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and then a 10-min extension at 72 °C. PCR products were cloned using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer and sequenced. Because alt-NHEJ is more evident in cells that are deficient in C-NHEJ (6Soulas-Sprauel P. Le Guyader G. Rivera-Munoz P. Abramowski V. Olivier-Martin C. Goujet-Zalc C. Charneau P. de Villartay J.P.

In a pre-B cell line, Nalm6 (Fig. 1A) and a lymphoblastoid cell line, NC10 (Fig. 1B), established from normal individuals, MRN and DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 were constitutively associated in undamaged cells but dissociated in response to ionizing radiation. Similar results were obtained with HeLa cells (Fig. 2B) and when the immunoprecipitation was carried out in the presence of ethidium bromide (data not shown).FIGURE 2Effect of DNA PK activity on DNA damage-dependent dissociation of DNA ligase IIIα and MRN. Nuclear extracts were prepared from DNA-PK-deficient, MO59J, and DNA PK-proficient, MO59K, glioblastoma cells (A, 45 μg) or HeLa cells (60 μg) (B) that had been either mock-treated (0) or treated with γ-irradiation (IR, 10 grays). Where indicated, cells were incubated without (−LY294) or with 200 μm LY294,002 (+LY294) for 30 min prior to irradiation.

Right, nuclear extracts were incubated with hMre11 antibody (IP: α-Mre11), and proteins in the immunoprecipitates were detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the lig4-null N114P2 cells (supplemental Fig. S1), the steady-state levels of DNA ligase IIIα are about 2-fold higher than in the wild-type parental Nalm6 cells (Fig. 1A, left). Similarly, the lymphoblastoid cell line, LB 2304, established from a DNA ligase IV-deficient individual (supplemental Fig. S1), has higher steady-state levels of DNA ligase IIIα than a comparable cell line from a normal individual (Fig. 1B, left). Despite the elevated steady-state levels of DNA ligase IIIα in DNA ligase IV-deficient cells (Fig. 1), the amount of DNA ligase IIIα constitutively associated with MRN was much lower than in comparable wild-type cells (Fig. 1). More strikingly, there was a dramatic increase in the amount of DNA ligase IIIα associated with MRN following DNA damage, suggesting that these factors participate together in a repair pathway that compensates for reduced C-NHEJ (Fig. 1). To determine whether the altered association of MRN and DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 is a common feature of cells that are defective in C-NHEJ, we utilized a pair of cell lines M059K and M059J established from a human glioblastoma that are DNA PK-proficient and -deficient (31Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day 3rd, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), respectively. The steady-state level of DNA ligase IIIα was significantly higher (about 8-fold) and more DNA ligase IIIα was associated with MRN in the absence of DNA damage in the DNA PK-deficient cells compared with the DNA PK-proficient cells (Fig. 2A). Because the DNA PK mutant cells are also ATM-defective (40Tsuchida R. Yamada T. Takagi M. Shimada A. Ishioka C. Katsuki Y. Igarashi T. Chessa L. Delia D. Teraoka H. Mizutani S. Radiat. Res. 2002; 158: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the contribution of DNA PK deficiency to the altered behavior of DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 cannot be definitively determined in these cells. To examine more directly the role of DNA PK in the DNA damage-induced dissociation of MRN and DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1, we carried out studies with the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294,002 that inhibits DNA PK but not ATM or ATR at 200 μm (41Stiff T. O'Driscoll M. Rief N. Iwabuchi K. Löbrich M. Jeggo P.A. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2390-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). As expected, incubation of HeLa cells with the DNA PK inhibitor for 30 min did not result in significant changes in the steady-state levels of MRN and DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1, but there was an approximately 1.5-fold increase in the amount DNA ligase IIIα associated with MRN in undamaged cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover, although the DNA PK inhibitor did not prevent the DNA damage-induced dissociation of MRN and DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1, significantly more DNA ligase IIIα remained associated MRN in extracts from cells treated with the DNA PK inhibitor (Fig. 2B). Because similar results were obtained with the DNA PK inhibitor and the DNA PK mutant cell line, it appears that DNA PK activity contributes to but is not required for the dissociation of MRN and DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 in undamaged cells and following DNA damage. The elevated steady-state levels of DNA ligase IIIα and the increased association with MRN following DNA damage in cells that are defective in C-NHEJ are consistent with these factors acting together in the repair of DSBs by alt-NHEJ. To determine whether MRN and DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 interact directly, we performed pulldown assays with the purified complexes. hRad50 and the other subunits of the MRN complex bound specifically to beads liganded by DNA ligase IIIβ (Fig. 3A), a germ cell-specific form of DNA ligase III that does not interact with XRCC1 (38Mackey Z.B. Ramos W. Levin D.S. Walter C.A. McCarrey J.R. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To identify which subunits of the MRN complex interact with DNA ligase IIIβ, we performed similar assays with purified hMre11/hRad50, hMre11/Nbs1, and hMre11 (Fig. 3B). The binding of the hMre11/hRad50 and hMre11/Nbs1 subcomplexes but not hMre11 alone suggests that DNA ligase IIIβ interacts with both the hRad50 and Nbs1 subunits of MRN. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, full-length Nbs1 and a truncated version containing just the N-terminal FHA domain interacted with both DNA ligase IIIα and DNA ligase IIIβ whereas a truncated version of Nbs1 lacking both the FHA and BRCT domains did not (Fig. 3C). To provide further evidence that the Nbs1 FHA domain mediates the interaction with DNA ligase III, we performed pulldown assays with labeled in vitro translated versions of Nbs1 either lacking the BRCT domain (Fig. 3D, upper) or lacking the FHA domain (Fig. 3D, lower). As expected, the polypeptide without the FHA domain was not retained by the DNA ligase IIIβ beads whereas the polypeptide lacking the BRCT domain was. In similar studies, we mapped the region of DNA ligase III that interacts with Nbs1 FHA domain to the N-terminal 390 amino acids (data not shown) that is not required for catalytic activity but contains the DNA-binding zinc finger motif (42Mackey Z.B.

MRN at a 1:1 and 2:1 ratio relative to DNA ligase IIIα/XRCC1 increased intermolecular ligation 1.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C).

The vacuum induces a group delay of 25 ns on the input optical pulse, corresponding to a light velocity of 1600 m/s, and a transparency of 40% that increases to 80% when the resonator is filled with 10 photons.

https://openalex.org/W1981232704,"The recombinant lysins of lytic phages, when applied externally to Gram-positive bacteria, can be efficient bactericidal agents, typically retaining high specificity. Their development as novel antibacterial agents offers many potential advantages over conventional antibiotics. Protein engineering could exploit this potential further by generating novel lysins fit for distinct target populations and environments. However, access to the peptidoglycan layer is controlled by a variety of secondary cell wall polymers, chemical modifications, and (in some cases) S-layers and capsules. Classical lysins require a cell wall-binding domain (CBD) that targets the catalytic domain to the peptidoglycan layer via binding to a secondary cell wall polymer component. The cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria generally have a negative charge, and we noticed a correlation between (positive) charge on the catalytic domain and bacteriolytic activity in the absence of the CBD (nonclassical behavior). We investigated a physical basis for this correlation by comparing the structures and activities of pairs of lysins where the lytic activity of one of each pair was CBD-independent. We found that by engineering a reversal of sign of the net charge of the catalytic domain, we could either eliminate or create CBD dependence. We also provide evidence that the S-layer of Bacillus anthracis acts as a molecular sieve that is chiefly size-dependent, favoring catalytic domains over full-length lysins. Our work suggests a number of facile approaches for fine-tuning lysin activity, either to enhance or reduce specificity/host range and/or bactericidal potential, as required."

In contrast to mice, X chromosome reactivation does not occur during the reprogramming of human female somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), although this view is contested. Using balanced populations of female Rett patient and control fibroblasts, we confirm that all cells in iPSC colonies contain an inactive X, and additionally find that all colonies made from the same donor fibroblasts contain the same inactive X chromosome. Notably, this extreme ""skewing"" toward a particular dominant, active X is also a general feature of primary female fibroblasts during proliferation, and the skewing seen in reprogramming and fibroblast culture can be alleviated by overexpression of telomerase. These results have important implications for in vitro modeling of X-linked diseases and the interpretation of long-term culture studies in cancer and senescence using primary female fibroblast cell lines."

Sanger sequencing technology is the method of choice for obtaining standard 650 bp cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcodes. However, DNA degradation/fragmentation makes it difficult to obtain a full-length barcode from old specimens. Mini-barcodes of 130 bp from the standard barcode region have been shown to be effective for accurate identification in many animal groups and may be readily obtained from museum samples. Here we demonstrate the application of an alternative sequencing technology, the four-enzymes single-specimen pyrosequencing, in rapid, cost-effective mini-barcode analysis. We were able to generate sequences of up to 100 bp from mini-barcode fragments of COI in 135 fresh and 50 old Lepidoptera specimens (ranging from 53-97 year-old). The sequences obtained using pyrosequencing were of high quality and we were able to robustly match all the tested pyro-sequenced samples to their respective Sanger-sequenced standard barcode sequences, where available. Simplicity of the protocol and instrumentation coupled with higher speed and lower cost per sequence than Sanger sequencing makes this approach potentially useful in efforts to link standard barcode sequences from unidentified specimens to known museum specimens with only short DNA fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2108464720,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals, including AIDS patients and transplant recipients. Few antifungals can treat C. neoformans infections, and drug resistance is increasing. Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) catalyzes post-translational lipidation of key signal transduction proteins and is essential in C. neoformans. We present a multidisciplinary study validating C. neoformans FTase (CnFTase) as a drug target, showing that several anticancer FTase inhibitors with disparate scaffolds can inhibit C. neoformans and suggesting structure-based strategies for further optimization of these leads. Structural studies are an essential element for species-specific inhibitor development strategies by revealing similarities and differences between pathogen and host orthologs that can be exploited. We, therefore, present eight crystal structures of CnFTase that define the enzymatic reaction cycle, basis of ligand selection, and structurally divergent regions of the active site. Crystal structures of clinically important anticancer FTase inhibitors in complex with CnFTase reveal opportunities for optimization of selectivity for the fungal enzyme by modifying functional groups that interact with structurally diverse regions. A substrate-induced conformational change in CnFTase is observed as part of the reaction cycle, a feature that is mechanistically distinct from human FTase. Our combined structural and functional studies provide a framework for developing FTase inhibitors to treat invasive fungal infections."
https://openalex.org/W1996433534,"Most avian influenza A viruses, which preferentially replicate at the high temperatures found in the digestive tract of birds, have a glutamic acid at residue 627 of the viral RNA polymerase PB2 subunit (Glu-627), whereas the human viruses, which optimally replicate at the low temperatures observed in the human respiratory tract, have a lysine (Lys-627). The mechanism of action for this mutation is still not understood, although interaction with host factors has been proposed to play a major role. In this study, we explored an alternative, yet related, hypothesis that this PB2 mutation may alter the temperature-dependent enzymatic polymerase activity of the viral polymerase. First, the avian polymerase protein, which was purified from baculovirus expression system, indeed remained significantly active at higher temperatures (i.e. 37 and 42 °C), whereas the human E627K mutant drastically lost activity at these high temperatures. Second, our steady-state kinetics data revealed that the human E627K mutant polymerase is catalytically more active than the avian Glu-627 polymerase at 34 °C. Importantly, the E627K mutation elevates apparent K(cat) at low temperatures with little effect on K(m), suggesting that the E627K mutation alters the biochemical steps involved in enzyme catalysis rather than the interaction with the incoming NTP. Third, this temperature-dependent kinetic impact of the human E627K mutation was also observed with different RNA templates, with different primers and also in the presence of nucleoprotein. In conclusion, our study suggests that the amino acid sequence variations at residue 627 of PB2 subunit can directly alter the enzyme kinetics of influenza polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2001581901,"Studies have shown that HIV-infected patients develop neurocognitive disorders characterized by neuronal dysfunction. The lack of productive infection of neurons by HIV suggests that viral and cellular proteins, with neurotoxic activities, released from HIV-1-infected target cells can cause this neuronal deregulation. The viral protein R (Vpr), a protein encoded by HIV-1, has been shown to alter the expression of various important cytokines and inflammatory proteins in infected and uninfected cells; however the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Using a human neuronal cell line, we found that Vpr can be taken up by neurons causing: (i) deregulation of calcium homeostasis, (ii) endoplasmic reticulum-calcium release, (iii) activation of the oxidative stress pathway, (iv) mitochondrial dysfunction and v- synaptic retraction. In search for the cellular factors involved, we performed microRNAs and gene array assays using human neurons (primary cultures or cell line, SH-SY5Y) that we treated with recombinant Vpr proteins. Interestingly, Vpr deregulates the levels of several microRNAs (e.g. miR-34a) and their target genes (e.g. CREB), which could lead to neuronal dysfunctions. Therefore, we conclude that Vpr plays a major role in neuronal dysfunction through deregulating microRNAs and their target genes, a phenomenon that could lead to the development of neurocognitive disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2165243145,"Declaring ""replication"" from results of genome wide association (GWA) studies is straightforward when major gene effects provide genome-wide significance for association of the same allele of the same SNP in each of multiple independent samples. However, such unambiguous replication is unlikely when phenotypes display polygenic genetic architecture, allelic heterogeneity, locus heterogeneity and when different samples display linkage disequilibria with different fine structures. We seek chromosomal regions that are tagged by clustered SNPs that display nominally-significant association in each of several independent samples. This approach provides one ""nontemplate"" approach to identifying overall replication of groups of GWA results in the face of difficult genetic architectures. We apply this strategy to 1 M SNP GWA results for dependence on: a) alcohol (including many individuals with dependence on other addictive substances) and b) at least one illegal substance (including many individuals dependent on alcohol). This approach provides high confidence in rejecting the null hypothesis that chance alone accounts for the extent to which clustered, nominally-significant SNPs from samples of the same racial/ethnic background identify the same sets of chromosomal regions. It identifies several genes that are also reported in other independent alcohol-dependence GWA datasets. There is more modest confidence in: a) identification of individual chromosomal regions and genes that are not also identified by data from other independent samples, b) the more modest overlap between results from samples of different racial/ethnic backgrounds and c) the extent to which any gene not identified herein is excluded, since the power of each of these individual samples is modest. Nevertheless, the strong overlap identified among the samples with similar racial/ethnic backgrounds supports contributions to individual differences in vulnerability to addictions that come from newer allelic variants that are common in subsets of current humans."
https://openalex.org/W2071737775,"Regulation of glucose homeostasis by insulin depends on pancreatic β-cell growth, survival, and function. Raf-1 kinase is a major downstream target of several growth factors that promote proliferation and survival of many cell types, including the pancreatic β cells. We have previously reported that insulin protects β cells from apoptosis and promotes proliferation by activating Raf-1 signaling in cultured human islets, mouse islets, and MIN6 cells. As Raf-1 activity is critical for basal apoptosis and insulin secretion in vitro, we hypothesized that Raf-1 may play an important role in glucose homeostasis in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the Cre-loxP recombination system to obtain a pancreatic β-cell-specific ablation of Raf-1 kinase gene (RIPCre+/+: Raf-1flox/flox) and a complete set of littermate controls (RIPCre+/+:Raf-1wt/wt). RIPCre+/+:Raf-1flox/flox mice were viable, and no effects on weight gain were observed. RIPCre+/+:Raf-1flox/flox mice had increased fasting blood glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance but normal insulin tolerance compared to littermate controls. Insulin secretion in vivo and in isolated islets was markedly impaired, but there was no apparent effect on the exocytosis machinery. However, islet insulin protein and insulin 2 mRNA, but not insulin 1 mRNA, were dramatically reduced in Raf-1-knockout mice. Analysis of insulin 2 knockout mice demonstrated that this reduction in mRNA was sufficient to impair in vivo insulin secretion. Our data further indicate that Raf-1 specifically and acutely regulates insulin 2 mRNA via negative action on Foxo1, which has been shown to selectively control the insulin 2 gene. This work provides the first direct evidence that Raf-1 signaling is essential for the regulation of basal insulin transcription and the supply of releasable insulin in vivo.—Alejandro, E.

https://openalex.org/W2041369127,"Post-translational modifications of RelA play an important role in regulation of NF-κB activation. We previously demonstrated that in malignant hematopoietic cells, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) induced RelA hyperacetylation and NF-κB activation, attenuating lethality. We now present evidence that IκB kinase (IKK) β-mediated RelA Ser-536 phosphorylation plays a significant functional role in promoting RelA acetylation, inducing NF-κB activation, and limiting HDACI lethality in human multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Immunoblot profiling revealed that although basal RelA phosphorylation varied in MM cells, Ser-536 phosphorylation correlated with IKK activity. Exposure to the pan-HDACIs vorinostat or LBH-589 induced phosphorylation of IKKα/β (Ser-180/Ser-181) and RelA (Ser-536) in MM cells, including cells expressing an IκBα ""super-repressor,"" accompanied by increased RelA nuclear translocation, acetylation, DNA binding, and transactivation activity. These events were substantially blocked by either pan-IKK or IKKβ-selective inhibitors, resulting in marked apoptosis. Consistent with these events, inhibitory peptides targeting either the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) binding domain for IKK complex formation or RelA phosphorylation sites also significantly increased HDACI lethality. Moreover, IKKβ knockdown by shRNA prevented Ser-536 phosphorylation and significantly enhanced HDACI susceptibility. Finally, introduction of a nonphosphorylatable RelA mutant S536A, which failed to undergo acetylation in response to HDACIs, impaired NF-κB activation and increased cell death. These findings indicate that HDACIs induce Ser-536 phosphorylation of the NF-κB subunit RelA through an IKKβ-dependent mechanism, an action that is functionally involved in activation of the cytoprotective NF-κB signaling cascade primarily through facilitation of RelA acetylation rather than nuclear translocation."

https://openalex.org/W2057313796,"Background The causes for the higher biodiversity in the Neotropics as compared to the Nearctic and the factors promoting species diversification in each region have been much debated. The refuge hypothesis posits that high tropical diversity reflects high speciation rates during the Pleistocene, but this conclusion has been challenged. The present study investigates this matter by examining continental patterns of avian diversification through the analysis of large-scale DNA barcode libraries. Methodology and Principal Findings Standardized COI datasets from the avifaunas of Argentina, the Nearctic, and the Palearctic were analyzed. Average genetic distances between closest congeners and sister species were higher in Argentina than in North America reflecting a much higher percentage of recently diverged species in the latter region. In the Palearctic genetic distances between closely related species appeared to be more similar to those of the southern Neotropics. Average intraspecific variation was similar in Argentina and North America, while the Palearctic fauna had a higher value due to a higher percentage of variable species. Geographic patterning of intraspecific structure was more complex in the southern Neotropics than in the Nearctic, while the Palearctic showed an intermediate level of complexity. Conclusions and Significance DNA barcodes can reveal continental patterns of diversification. Our analysis suggests that avian species are older in Argentina than in the Nearctic, supporting the idea that the greater diversity of the Neotropical avifauna is not caused by higher recent speciation rates. Species in the Palearctic also appear to be older than those in the Nearctic. These results, combined with the patterns of geographic structuring found in each region, suggest a major impact of Pleistocene glaciations in the Nearctic, a lesser effect in the Palearctic and a mild effect in the southern Neotropics."
https://openalex.org/W2060274898,"Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that transmit Plasmodium falciparum malaria use a series of olfactory cues present in human sweat to locate their hosts for a blood meal. Recognition of these odor cues occurs through the interplay of odorant receptors and odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) that bind to odorant molecules and transport and present them to the receptors. Recent studies have implicated potential heterodimeric interactions between two OBPs, OBP1 and OBP4, as important for perception of indole by the mosquito (Biessmann, H., Andronopoulou, E., Biessmann, M. R., Douris, V., Dimitratos, S. D., Eliopoulos, E., Guerin, P. M., Iatrou, K., Justice, R. W., Kröber, T., Marinotti, O., Tsitoura, P., Woods, D. F., and Walter, M. F.

(2011) Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 68, 1799–1813). Here we present the 2.0 Å crystal structure of the OBP4-indole complex, which adopts a classical odorant-binding protein fold, with indole bound at one end of a central hydrophobic cavity. Solution-based NMR studies reveal that OBP4 exists in a molten globule state and binding of indole induces a dramatic conformational shift to a well ordered structure, and this leads to the formation of the binding site for OBP1. Analysis of the OBP4-OBP1 interaction reveals a network of contacts between residues in the OBP1 binding site and the core of the protein and suggests how the interaction of the two proteins can alter the binding affinity for ligands. These studies provide evidence that conformational ordering plays a key role in regulating heteromeric interactions between OBPs. Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that transmit Plasmodium falciparum malaria use a series of olfactory cues present in human sweat to locate their hosts for a blood meal. Recognition of these odor cues occurs through the interplay of odorant receptors and odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) that bind to odorant molecules and transport and present them to the receptors. Recent studies have implicated potential heterodimeric interactions between two OBPs, OBP1 and OBP4, as important for perception of indole by the mosquito (Biessmann, H., Andronopoulou, E., Biessmann, M. R., Douris, V., Dimitratos, S. D., Eliopoulos, E., Guerin, P. M., Iatrou, K., Justice, R. W., Kröber, T., Marinotti, O., Tsitoura, P., Woods, D. F., and Walter, M. F.

(2011) Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 68, 1799–1813). Here we present the 2.0 Å crystal structure of the OBP4-indole complex, which adopts a classical odorant-binding protein fold, with indole bound at one end of a central hydrophobic cavity. Solution-based NMR studies reveal that OBP4 exists in a molten globule state and binding of indole induces a dramatic conformational shift to a well ordered structure, and this leads to the formation of the binding site for OBP1. Analysis of the OBP4-OBP1 interaction reveals a network of contacts between residues in the OBP1 binding site and the core of the protein and suggests how the interaction of the two proteins can alter the binding affinity for ligands.

https://openalex.org/W1996666974,"With the volume of molecular sequence data that is systematically being generated globally, there is a need for centralized resources for data exploration and analytics. DNA Barcode initiatives are on track to generate a compendium of molecular sequence-based signatures for identifying animals and plants. To date, the range of available data exploration and analytic tools to explore these data have only been available in a boutique form--often representing a frustrating hurdle for many researchers that may not necessarily have resources to install or implement algorithms described by the analytic community. The Barcode of Life Data Portal (BDP) is a first step towards integrating the latest biodiversity informatics innovations with molecular sequence data from DNA barcoding. Through establishment of community driven standards, based on discussion with the Data Analysis Working Group (DAWG) of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL), the BDP provides an infrastructure for incorporation of existing and next-generation DNA barcode analytic applications in an open forum."
https://openalex.org/W2007037113,"In vertebrates, the thyroglobulin (Tg) gene product must be exported to the lumen of thyroid follicles for thyroid hormone synthesis. In toto, Tg is composed of multiple type-1 repeats connected by linker and hinge (altogether considered as ""region I,"" nearly 1,200 residues); regions II-III (~720 residues); and cholinesterase-like (ChEL) domain (~570 residues). Regions II-III and ChEL rapidly acquire competence for secretion, yet regions I-II-III require 20 min to become a partially mature disulfide isomer; stabilization of a fully oxidized form requires ChEL. Transition from partially mature to mature Tg occurs as a discrete ""jump"" in mobility by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, suggesting formation of at most a few final pairings of Cys residues that may be separated by significant intervening primary sequence. Using two independent approaches, we have investigated which portion of Tg is engaged in this late stage of its maturation. First, we demonstrate that this event is linked to oxidation involving region I. Introduction of the Tg-C1245R mutation in the hinge (identical to that causing human goitrous hypothyroidism) inhibits this maturation, although the Cys-1245 partner remains unidentified. Second, we find that Tg truncated after its fourth type-1 repeat is a fully independent secretory protein. Together, the data indicate that final acquisition of secretory competence includes conformational maturation in the interval between linker and hinge segments of region I."
https://openalex.org/W2135486974,"PDZRhoGEF (PRG) belongs to a small family of RhoA-specific nucleotide exchange factors that mediates signaling through select G-protein-coupled receptors via Gα(12/13) and activates RhoA by catalyzing the exchange of GDP to GTP. PRG is a multidomain protein composed of PDZ, regulators of G-protein signaling-like (RGSL), Dbl-homology (DH), and pleckstrin-homology (PH) domains. It is autoinhibited in cytosol and is believed to undergo a conformational rearrangement and translocation to the membrane for full activation, although the molecular details of the regulation mechanism are not clear. It has been shown recently that the main autoregulatory elements of PDZRhoGEF, the autoinhibitory ""activation box"" and the ""GEF switch,"" which is required for full activation, are located directly upstream of the catalytic DH domain and its RhoA binding surface, emphasizing the functional role of the RGSL-DH linker. Here, using a combination of biophysical and biochemical methods, we show that the mechanism of PRG regulation is yet more complex and may involve an additional autoinhibitory element in the form of a molten globule region within the linker between RGSL and DH domains. We propose a novel, two-tier model of autoinhibition where the activation box and the molten globule region act synergistically to impair the ability of RhoA to bind to the catalytic DH-PH tandem. The molten globule region and the activation box become less ordered in the PRG-RhoA complex and dissociate from the RhoA-binding site, which may constitute a critical step leading to PRG activation."
https://openalex.org/W1996326530,"Background Birds may allocate a significant part of time to comfort behavior (e.g., preening, stretching, shaking, etc.) in order to eliminate parasites, maintain plumage integrity, and possibly reduce muscular ankylosis. Understanding the adaptive value of comfort behavior would benefit from knowledge on the energy costs animals are willing to pay to maintain it, particularly under situations of energy constraints, e.g., during fasting. We determined time and energy devoted to comfort activities in freely breeding king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus), seabirds known to fast for up to one month during incubation shifts ashore. Methodology/Principal Findings A time budget was estimated from focal and scan sampling field observations and the energy cost of comfort activities was calculated from the associated increase in heart rate (HR) during comfort episodes, using previously determined equations relating HR to energy expenditure. We show that incubating birds spent 22% of their daily time budget in comfort behavior (with no differences between day and night) mainly devoted to preening (73%) and head/body shaking (16%). During comfort behavior, energy expenditure averaged 1.24 times resting metabolic rate (RMR) and the corresponding energy cost (i.e., energy expended in excess to RMR) was 58 kJ/hr. Energy expenditure varied greatly among various types of comfort behavior, ranging from 1.03 (yawning) to 1.78 (stretching) times RMR. Comfort behavior contributed 8.8–9.3% to total daily energy expenditure and 69.4–73.5% to energy expended daily for activity. About half of this energy was expended caring for plumage. Conclusion/Significance This study is the first to estimate the contribution of comfort behavior to overall energy budget in a free-living animal. It shows that although breeding on a tight energy budget, king penguins devote a substantial amount of time and energy to comfort behavior. Such findings underline the importance of comfort behavior for the fitness of colonial seabirds."

https://openalex.org/W1966792442,"Deficits in sensorimotor gating measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle have been known as characteristics of patients with schizophrenia and related neuropsychiatric disorders. PPI disruption is thought to rely on the activity of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and is inhibited by most antipsychotic drugs. These drugs however act also at the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway and exert adverse locomotor responses. Finding a way to inhibit the mesocorticolimbic- without affecting the nigrostriatal-dopaminergic pathway may thus be beneficial to antipsychotic therapies. The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) system has been shown to modulate dopamine-related responses. Its receptor (MCH1R) is expressed at high levels in the mesocorticolimbic and not in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. Interestingly a genomic linkage study revealed significant associations between schizophrenia and markers located in the MCH1R gene locus. We hypothesize that the MCH system can selectively modulate the behavior associated with the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway. Using mice, we found that central administration of MCH potentiates apomorphine-induced PPI deficits. Using congenic rat lines that differ in their responses to PPI, we found that the rats that are susceptible to apomorphine (APO-SUS rats) and exhibit PPI deficits display higher MCH mRNA expression in the lateral hypothalamic region and that blocking the MCH system reverses their PPI deficits. On the other hand, in mice and rats, activation or inactivation of the MCH system does not affect stereotyped behaviors, dopamine-related responses that depend on the activity of the nigrostriatal pathway. Furthermore MCH does not affect dizocilpine-induced PPI deficit, a glutamate related response. Thus, our data present the MCH system as a regulator of sensorimotor gating, and provide a new rationale to understand the etiologies of schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2032579126,"Recent crystallographic studies suggested that fully liganded human hemoglobin can adopt multiple quaternary conformations that include the two previously solved relaxed conformations, R and R2, whereas fully unliganded deoxyhemoglobin may adopt only one T (tense) quaternary conformation. An important unanswered question is whether R, R2, and other relaxed quaternary conformations represent different physiological states with different oxygen affinities. Here, we answer this question by showing the oxygen equilibrium curves of single crystals of human hemoglobin in the R and R2 state. In this study, we have used a naturally occurring mutant hemoglobin C (β6 Glu→Lys) to stabilize the R and R2 crystals. Additionally, we have refined the x-ray crystal structure of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin C, in the R and R2 state, to 1.4 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively, to compare precisely the structures of both types of relaxed states. Despite the large quaternary structural difference between the R and R2 state, both crystals exhibit similar noncooperative oxygen equilibrium curves with a very high affinity for oxygen, comparable with the fourth oxygen equilibrium constant (K4) of human hemoglobin in solution. One small difference is that the R2 crystals have an oxygen affinity that is 2–3 times higher than that of the R crystals. These results demonstrate that the functional difference between the two typical relaxed quaternary conformations is small and physiologically less important, indicating that these relaxed conformations simply reflect a structural polymorphism of a high affinity relaxed state.

These results demonstrate that the functional difference between the two typical relaxed quaternary conformations is small and physiologically less important, indicating that these relaxed conformations simply reflect a structural polymorphism of a high affinity relaxed state. Human hemoglobin, an α2β2 tetrameric protein that exhibits strong cooperativity during oxygenation/deoxygenation, has long served as a model for understanding the structure-function relationships of allosteric proteins (1Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). For many years, the α2β2 hemoglobin tetramer was though to adopt only two stable quaternary structures, the low affinity T (tense) and high affinity R (relaxed) structures, which are well suited to the notion of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux two-state allosteric model (2Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). This view was largely supported by crystallographic evidence that only one quaternary conformation (classical T structure) has so far been observed in a number of different crystals forms of human wild-type, mutant, and chemically modified deoxyhemoglobins (3Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Shaanan B. Fourme R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 4Kavanaugh J.S. Rogers P.H. Case D.A. Arnone A.

Likewise, the early crystallographic studies demonstrate that the structures of two independent fully liganded proteins, horse methemoglobin and human oxy (or carbonmonoxy) hemoglobin, assume essentially the same quaternary conformation (classical R structure) despite different crystal-packing contacts (7Ladner R.C. Heidner E.J. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 385-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 8Baldwin J.M. J. Mol.

However, this simple view was challenged in the early 1990s by the discovery of a second relaxed state for fully liganded hemoglobin, known as R2 or Y, the quaternary structure of which is substantially different from that of the R state (10Smith F.R. Lattman E.E. Carter Jr., C.W. Proteins. 1991; 10: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Silva M.M. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17248-17256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Computational studies suggest that R2 may be the relaxed end state in a T→R→R2 allosteric pathway, rather than an intermediate between T and R or an off-pathway intermediate (12Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 11113-11117Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Also, recent NMR studies using 15N-1H residual dipolar couplings show that the quaternary conformation of human carbonmonoxyhemoglobin in solution is a dynamic ensemble of different quaternary structures that include the crystallographically identified R and R2 states (13Lukin J.A. Kontaxis G. Simplaceanu V. Yuan Y. Bax A. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation in solution, recent crystallographic studies identify previously unrecognized relaxed conformations that lie between R and R2 (14Mueser T.C. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15353-15364Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Biswal B.K. Vijayan M. Curr. Sci. 2001; 81: 1100-1105Google Scholar, 16Safo M.K. Abraham D.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8347-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although an additional liganded end state, R3, has also been proposed to exist (16Safo M.K. Abraham D.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8347-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These recent findings strongly suggest that the fully liganded hemoglobin molecule is capable of traversing multiple conformations. A basic question emerges as to whether R, R2, and other potential liganded conformations represent different physiological states with different oxygen affinities or whether they simply reflect a structural polymorphism of a high affinity relaxed state. To address this question directly, in this study we have determined the oxygen equilibrium curves of single crystals of human hemoglobin in the R and R2 quaternary structures by using absorption microspectrophotometry. Previous microspectrophotometry studies on crystals of human deoxyhemoglobin in the T (tense) state demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the oxygen affinity of crystalline hemoglobin, opening up a new method for a direct comparison of the x-ray structure with its function in the same crystalline state (17Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, so far this approach has not been applied to crystals of the fully liganded forms of hemoglobin, primarily because crystals of oxy (or carbonmonoxy) hemoglobin A in the R or R2 state shatter upon deoxygenation. Moreover, because those crystals are expected to have a high affinity for oxygen, they should be equilibrated with low oxygen pressures, requiring a very long experimental time. An additional difficulty is that the R2 crystals of hemoglobin A must be preserved under low pH conditions (below pH 6) (11Silva M.M. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17248-17256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the autooxidation rate is significantly increased. Here, we now show that the use of thin flat crystals of hemoglobin C (β6 Glu→Lys) in the R and R2 state can overcome most of these problems, thus enabling determination of their oxygen dissociation curves. It is known that hemoglobin C crystallizes much more readily than hemoglobin A due to the β6 Glu to Lys surface mutation, which makes the protein less soluble but does not significantly perturb the oxygen equilibrium properties (19Fitzgerald P.M. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 603-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Dewan J.C. Feeling-Taylor A. Puius Y.A. Patskovska L. Patskovsky Y. Nagel R.L. Almo S.C. Hirsch R.E.

Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As a result, this mutant yields both R and R2 crystals of very high quality under mild conditions at neutral pH. Note that the use of thin crystals is, on the one hand, advantageous for shortening the experimental time, but, on the other hand, disadvantageous as to the signal to noise ratio of the absorption data. Thus, unlike previous measurements using oriented crystals and linearly polarized light (17Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we have used unpolarized light incident on horizontally oriented, thin flat crystals, to eliminate stray light reflected from the polarizer and to keep the signal to noise ratio as high as possible. In addition to the functional study, we have refined the crystal structure of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin C, in the R and R2 state, to 1.4 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively. These high resolution data allow us to compare precisely the structures of both types of relaxed states, enabling discussion with the observed oxygen equilibrium curves of both states. CS human blood was kindly obtained from Dr. Kazuhiko Adachi (The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA) and stripped as reported previously. The stripped hemoglobin sample was passed through a column of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with CO-saturated 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.85, and then applied to a column of CM52 cellulose (Whatman) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of the same CO-saturated buffer, followed by 2 column volumes of the same buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) to reduce (albeit the small amount of) methemoglobin in the original hemoglobin sample. After washing the column with 5 column volumes of the same CO-saturated buffer without dithionite, the column was eluted by a linear gradient of 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.15, and 0.04 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.60. The second major peak corresponding to hemoglobin C was collected and concentrated. Crystallization of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin C in the R state was carried out at 20 °C according to the batch method of Fitzgerald and Love (19Fitzgerald P.M. Love W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 132: 603-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), with some modifications, to give a CO-saturated 2.0% (w/v) hemoglobin solution containing 1.65 m phosphate buffer (0.528 m NaH2PO4 and 1.122 m K2HPO4, pH 7.2), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (w/v) d,l-homocysteine. A glass tube containing the above crystallization solution was placed into a gas-tight glass vial and quickly sealed under CO. Note that this vial also contained a small amount of Oxygen Absorbing System A-500HS (ISO, Yokohama, Japan) powder in its gas part, to maintain complete anaerobic conditions during crystallization. Similarly, crystals of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin C in the R2 state were obtained, using the same batch method at 20 °C, from CO-saturated 1.0% (w/v) hemoglobin solutions containing 11% (w/v) PEG 3350, 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, and 10% (v/v) glycerol under complete anaerobic conditions. Both types of hemoglobin C crystals grew rapidly to their maximum dimensions within a few day. The mother liquors containing 15 and 20% (v/v) glycerol were used for the R and R2 crystals, respectively, as cryoprotectant in which the crystals were rinsed briefly before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected using an ADSC Q270 CCD detector at beamlines BL17A and BL1A of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The wavelength of the incident x-rays was 1.0 Å. Diffraction datasets were processed with HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Crystals for oxygen equilibrium measurements were grown under the above mentioned conditions except for the absence of glycerol. Among grown crystals of various shapes, thin flat crystals were chosen for measurements. Specifically, the R and R2 crystals used were hexagonal and trapezoidal in shape, respectively, each having a well developed (010) (or ac) crystal face. The crystals were washed with the mother liquors (0.8 m NaH2PO4 and 1.7 m K2HPO4 (pH 7.2) for the R crystals, and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6 or 7.2) for the R2 crystals) containing 0.1 mg of catalase/ml (Sigma). For spectral measurements a single crystal with about 20 μl of its mother liquor was placed on a cover glass and then sealed into a flow chamber. Usually the settled crystal did not move during the measurements, because its well developed (010) face made good contact with the glass surface. The flow chamber was mounted on the stage of a Ziess UMSP 80 microspectrophotometer. Before measurements, removal of CO was carried out in the flow chamber with humidified oxygen, at a gas flow of 10 ml/min, under illumination of the white light of the microspectrophotometer. The time required for this conversion was <1 h, when small thin, flat crystals were used. Humidified nitrogen-oxygen gas mixtures at defined partial oxygen pressures were prepared by a GB-4C gas blender (Kofloc, Japan) with modifications and flowed into the chamber. The oxygen pressures were detected in the outflow from the chamber using a MC-7G-L galvanic O2 sensor (Iijima, Japan). The absorption spectra of crystals equilibrated with different oxygen pressures at 21–22 °C were recorded between 450 and 700 nm with unpolarized light incident on (010) crystal face. According to the method of Mozzarelli et al. (17Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the fractional saturation of the ferrous hemes with oxygen (Y) was calculated by a least square fit of the observed absorption spectra to a linear combination of three reference spectra and a base-line offset. The reference spectra are the absorption spectra of crystals of oxy-, deoxy-, and methemoglobin C. These spectra were determined on the same crystal as used for the oxygen equilibrium measurement. Because increases in oxygen pressure above 380 torr caused no appreciable spectral changes for the R or R2 crystals, the spectrum obtained under pure oxygen, after correction for the contribution from the methemoglobin content, was taken as the reference spectrum for oxyhemoglobin C. Note that the contribution from methemoglobin was removed by subtracting increasing amounts of the methemoglobin reference spectrum (see below) until the band at 630 nm disappeared. After each oxygen equilibrium measurement, the crystal was reduced by washing with mother liquor containing 0.2% (w/v) sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) for the measurement of the deoxyhemoglobin reference spectrum. In most cases the R and R2 crystals did not crack upon deoxygenation with dithionite. The crystal was then washed with mother liquor to remove sodium dithionite, followed by washing with mother liquor containing 5 mm potassium ferricyanide to oxidize the crystal for the measurement of the methemoglobin reference spectrum. At present, in the PDB the highest resolution data for the R and R2 structures of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin C are those of Hirsh and colleagues, determined at 2.0 and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively (20Dewan J.C. Feeling-Taylor A. Puius Y.A. Patskovska L. Patskovsky Y. Nagel R.L. Almo S.C. Hirsch R.E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (PDB codes 1K1K and 1M9P). These resolutions are sufficient to be able to assign their quaternary structures but insufficient to make a precise comparison between their heme environmental structures. To improve this situation, we have undertaken the refinement of the crystal structures of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin C, in the R and R2 state, to 1.4 and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively (Table 1). In this study, the best crystals of the R and R2 state have been obtained under high salt conditions at pH 7.2 and low salt conditions at pH 7.6, respectively. As summarized in Table 2, in both α and β subunits the proximal His(F8) geometries relative to the heme are very similar between R-COHbC and R2-COHbC and are similar to R-COHbA. Remarkably, in both subunits distances between the proximal His(F8) side chains and the hemes are virtually identical in these relaxed conformations and shorter than T-deoxyHbA (Table 2), suggesting that the proximal strain, which is one of the key factors determining oxygen affinity, is relieved to a similar extent in R-COHbC, R2-COHbC, and R-COHbA. Also, in both subunits the distal ligand environments are in general similar between R-COHbC and R2-COHbC (Table 2). One exception is the distal His(E7), which appears to be positioned differently between R-COHbC and R2-COHbC (Fig. 1, A–D and Table 2). However, this disagreement cannot be considered significant because the distal His(E7) side chains are not so well ordered in the α2, β1, and β2 subunits in R2-COHbC, as indicated by the lack of well defined electron density map, whereas all other heme peripheral residues in R2-COHbC and those in R-COHbC (including Hisα58 and Hisβ63) are well ordered.TABLE 2Stereochemical parameters for heme geometry and environmentR-COHbCR2-COHbCT-deoxyHbAaT-deoxyHbA and R-COHbA are the 1.25 Å resolution crystal structures of T state deoxyhemoglobin A (PDB code 2DN2) and R state carbonmonoxyhemoglobin A (PDB code 2DN3), respectively (32).R-COHbAaT-deoxyHbA and R-COHbA are the 1.25 Å resolution crystal structures of T state deoxyhemoglobin A (PDB code 2DN2) and R state carbonmonoxyhemoglobin A (PDB code 2DN3), respectively (32).Parametersαβα1(α2)β1(β2)αβαβDistances to heme planes (Å)bPheme is the mean plane of porphyrin nitrogen atoms and carbon atoms plus first side chain (32 atoms), and PC is the mean plane of the 20 porphyrin carbon atoms.

Open table in a new tab The observed dynamic behavior of His(E7) is not surprising because mutagenesis and kinetics studies show that the motilities of the distal His(E7) side chains are essential for opening a major channel for ligand entry in both hemoglobin subunits (28Birukou I.

Also, crystallographic evidence for the His(E7) gate has recently been obtained for a new relaxed state of hemoglobin A at pH 6.4 (referred to here as RR3; PDB code 3D17), which shows a rotation of the β distal His(E7) out of the distal pocket, creating a direct channel to the bulk solvent (30Jenkins J.D. Musayev F.N. Danso-Danquah R. Abraham D.J. Safo M.K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By contrast, so far there has been no crystallographic evidence for an opened ligand channel in human hemoglobin α subunits. This is probably because the α distal pocket is not so flexible as the β one, as predicted by the effects of mutagenesis (28Birukou I. Schweers R.L. Olson J.S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2020210937,"Combinatorial libraries of artificial zinc-finger transcription factors (ZF-TFs) provide a robust tool for inducing and understanding various functional components of the cancer phenotype. Herein, we utilized combinatorial ZF-TF library technology to better understand how breast cancer cells acquire resistance to fulvestrant, a clinically important anti-endocrine therapeutic agent. From a diverse collection of nearly 400,000 different ZF-TFs, we isolated six ZF-TF library members capable of inducing stable, long-term anti-endocrine drug-resistance in two independent estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell lines. Comparative gene expression profile analysis of the six different ZF-TF-transduced breast cancer cell lines revealed five distinct clusters of differentially expressed genes. One cluster was shared among all 6 ZF-TF-transduced cell lines and therefore constituted a common fulvestrant-resistant gene expression signature. Pathway enrichment-analysis of this common fulvestrant resistant signature also revealed significant overlap with gene sets associated with an estrogen receptor-negative-like state and with gene sets associated with drug resistance to different classes of breast cancer anti-endocrine therapeutic agents. Enrichment-analysis of the four remaining unique gene clusters revealed overlap with myb-regulated genes. Finally, we also demonstrated that the common fulvestrant-resistant signature is associated with poor prognosis by interrogating five independent, publicly available human breast cancer gene expression datasets. Our results demonstrate that artificial ZF-TF libraries can be used successfully to induce stable drug-resistance in human cancer cell lines and to identify a gene expression signature that is associated with a clinically relevant drug-resistance phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2050543969,"The simulation of complex biochemical systems, consisting of intertwined subsystems, is a challenging task in computational biology. The complex biochemical organization of the cell is effectively modeled by the minimal cell model called chemoton, proposed by Gánti. Since the chemoton is a system consisting of a large but fixed number of interacting molecular species, it can effectively be implemented in a process algebra-based language such as the BlenX programming language. The stochastic model behaves comparably to previous continuous deterministic models of the chemoton. Additionally to the well-known chemoton, we also implemented an extended version with two competing template cycles. The new insight from our study is that the coupling of reactions in the chemoton ensures that these templates coexist providing an alternative solution to Eigen's paradox. Our technical innovation involves the introduction of a two-state switch to control cell growth and division, thus providing an example for hybrid methods in BlenX. Further developments to the BlenX language are suggested in the Appendix."

https://openalex.org/W2012100578,"HIV-1 vertically infected children in the USA are living into adolescence and beyond with the widespread use of antiretroviral drugs. These patients exhibit striking differences in the rate of HIV-1 disease progression which could provide insights into mechanisms of control. We hypothesized that differences in the pattern of immunodomination including breadth, magnitude and polyfunctionality of HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cell response could partially explain differences in progression rate.In this study, we mapped, quantified, and assessed the functionality of these responses against individual HIV-1 Gag peptides in 58 HIV-1 vertically infected adolescents. Subjects were divided into two groups depending upon the rate of disease progression: adolescents with a sustained CD4%≥25 were categorized as having no immune suppression (NS), and those with CD4%≤15 categorized as having severe immune suppression (SS). We observed differences in the area of HIV-1-Gag to which the two groups made responses. In addition, subjects who expressed the HLA- B*57 or B*42 alleles were highly likely to restrict their immunodominant response through these alleles. There was a significantly higher frequency of naïve CD8+ T cells in the NS subjects (p = 0.0066) compared to the SS subjects. In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in any other CD8+ T cell subsets. The differentiation profiles and multifunctionality of Gag-specific CD8+ T cells, regardless of immunodominance, also failed to demonstrate meaningful differences between the two groups.Together, these data suggest that, at least in vertically infected adolescents, the region of HIV-1-Gag targeted by CD8+ T cells and the magnitude of that response relative to other responses may have more importance on the rate of disease progression than their qualitative effector functions."
