https://openalex.org/W2062055186,"Background and Objective Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder, characterized by depletion of the normal lactobacillus-dominant microbiota and overgrowth of commensal anaerobic bacteria. This study aimed to investigate the composition of the vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age (healthy women and women with BV), with the view of developing molecular criteria for BV diagnosis. Materials and Methods Vaginal samples from 163 women (79 control, 73 BV and 11 intermediate (Lactobacillary grade II flora) cases) were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing of the hypervariable regions V3–V4 of the 16S rRNA gene and 16 quantitative bacterial species/genus-specific real-time PCR assays. Sensitivities and specificities of potential BV markers were computed using the Amsel criteria as reference standard for BV. The use of quantitative thresholds for prediction of BV, determined for both relative abundance measured with 454 pyrosequencing and bacterial load measured with qPCR, was evaluated. Results Relative to the healthy women, the BV patients had in their vaginal microbiota significantly higher prevalence, loads and relative abundances of the majority of BV associated bacteria. However, only Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Eggerthella, Prevotella, BVAB2 and Megasphaera type 1 detected at or above optimal thresholds were highly predictable for BV, with the best diagnostic accuracy shown for A. vaginae. The depletion of Lactobacillus species combined with the presence of either G. vaginalis or A. vaginae at diagnostic levels was a highly accurate BV predictor. Conclusions Quantitative determination of the presence of G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, Eggerthella, Prevotella, BVAB2 and Megasphaera type 1 as well as the depletion of Lactobacillus was highly accurate for BV diagnosis. Measurements of abundance of normal and BV microbiota relative to total bacteria in vaginal fluid may provide more accurate BV diagnosis, and be used for test-of-cure, rather than qualitative detection or absolute counts of BV related microorganisms."

Biomarkers that capture the complex and heterogeneous biology of RA have the potential to complement clinical disease activity assessment.To develop a multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) test for rheumatoid arthritis.Candidate serum protein biomarkers were selected from extensive literature screens, bioinformatics databases, mRNA expression and protein microarray data. Quantitative assays were identified and optimized for measuring candidate biomarkers in RA patient sera. Biomarkers with qualifying assays were prioritized in a series of studies based on their correlations to RA clinical disease activity (e.g. the Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein [DAS28-CRP], a validated metric commonly used in clinical trials) and their contributions to multivariate models. Prioritized biomarkers were used to train an algorithm to measure disease activity, assessed by correlation to DAS and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for classification of low vs. moderate/high disease activity. The effect of comorbidities on the MBDA score was evaluated using linear models with adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing.130 candidate biomarkers were tested in feasibility studies and 25 were selected for algorithm training. Multi-biomarker statistical models outperformed individual biomarkers at estimating disease activity. Biomarker-based scores were significantly correlated with DAS28-CRP and could discriminate patients with low vs. moderate/high clinical disease activity. Such scores were also able to track changes in DAS28-CRP and were significantly associated with both joint inflammation measured by ultrasound and damage progression measured by radiography. The final MBDA algorithm uses 12 biomarkers to generate an MBDA score between 1 and 100. No significant effects on the MBDA score were found for common comorbidities.We followed a stepwise approach to develop a quantitative serum-based measure of RA disease activity, based on 12-biomarkers, which was consistently associated with clinical disease activity levels."
https://openalex.org/W2059124041,"Previous evidence from post-mortem Alzheimer disease (AD) brains and drug (especially rapamycin)-oriented in vitro and in vivo models implicated an aberrant accumulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) in tangle-bearing neurons in AD brains and its role in the formation of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. Compelling evidence indicated that the sequential molecular events such as the synthesis and phosphorylation of tau can be regulated through p70 S6 kinase, the well characterized immediate downstream target of mTor. In the present study, we further identified that the active form of mTor per se accumulates in tangle-bearing neurons, particularly those at early stages in AD brains. By using mass spectrometry and Western blotting, we identified three phosphoepitopes of tau directly phosphorylated by mTor. We have developed a variety of stable cell lines with genetic modification of mTor activity using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells as background. In these cellular systems, we not only confirmed the tau phosphorylation sites found in vitro but also found that mTor mediates the synthesis and aggregation of tau, resulting in compromised microtubule stability. Changes of mTor activity cause fluctuation of the level of a battery of tau kinases such as protein kinase A, v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog-1, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and tau protein phosphatase 2A. These results implicate mTor in promoting an imbalance of tau homeostasis, a condition required for neurons to maintain physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W2086825712,"Although research has provided abundant evidence for Taichi-induced improvements in psychological and physiological well-being, little is known about possible links to brain structure of Taichi practice. Using high-resolution MRI of 22 Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) practitioners and 18 controls matched for age, sex and education, we set out to examine the underlying anatomical correlates of long-term Taichi practice at two different levels of regional specificity. For this purpose, parcel-wise and vertex-wise analyses were employed to quantify the difference between TCC practitioners and the controls based on cortical surface reconstruction. We also adopted the Attention Network Test (ANT) to explore the effect of TCC on executive control. TCC practitioners, compared with controls, showed significantly thicker cortex in precentral gyrus, insula sulcus and middle frontal sulcus in the right hemisphere and superior temporal gyrus and medial occipito-temporal sulcus and lingual sulcus in the left hemisphere. Moreover, we found that thicker cortex in left medial occipito-temporal sulcus and lingual sulcus was associated with greater intensity of TCC practice. These findings indicate that long-term TCC practice could induce regional structural change and also suggest TCC might share similar patterns of neural correlates with meditation and aerobic exercise."
https://openalex.org/W1988250137,"Plants that can adapt their phenotype may be more likely to survive changing environmental conditions. Heritable epigenetic variation could provide a way to rapidly adapt to such changes. Here we tested whether environmental stress induces heritable, potentially adaptive phenotypic changes independent of genetic variation over few generations in Arabidopsis thaliana. We grew two accessions (Col-0, Sha-0) of A. thaliana for three generations under salt, heat and control conditions and tested for induced heritable phenotypic changes in the fourth generation (G4) and in reciprocal F1 hybrids generated in generation three. Using these crosses we further tested whether phenotypic changes were maternally or paternally transmitted. In generation five (G5), we assessed whether phenotypic effects persisted over two generations in the absence of stress. We found that exposure to heat stress in previous generations accelerated flowering under G4 control conditions in Sha-0, but heritable effects disappeared in G5 after two generations without stress exposure. Previous exposure to salt stress increased salt tolerance in one of two reciprocal F1 hybrids. Transgenerational effects were maternally and paternally inherited. Lacking genetic variability, maternal and paternal inheritance and reversibility of transgenerational effects together indicate that stress can induce heritable, potentially adaptive phenotypic changes, probably through epigenetic mechanisms. These effects were strongly dependent on plant genotype and may not be a general response to stress in A. thaliana."
https://openalex.org/W1995304737,"Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CNP) is the major dose-limiting factor in cancer chemotherapy. However, the neural mechanisms underlying CNP remain enigmatic. Accumulating evidence implicates the involvement of spinal glia in some neuropathic pain models. In this study, using a vincristine-evoked CNP rat model with obvious mechanical allodynia, we found that spinal astrocyte rather than microglia was dramatically activated. The mechanical allodynia was dose-dependently attenuated by intrathecal administratration of L-α-aminoadipate (astrocytic specific inhibitor); whereas minocycline (microglial specific inhibitor) had no such effect, indicating that spinal astrocytic activation contributes to allodynia in CNP rat. Furthermore, oxidative stress mediated the development of spinal astrocytic activation, and activated astrocytes dramatically increased interleukin-1β expression which induced N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) phosphorylation in spinal neurons to strengthen pain transmission. Taken together, our findings suggest that spinal activated astrocytes may be a crucial component of the pathophysiology of CNP and ""Astrocyte-Cytokine-NMDAR-neuron"" pathway may be one detailed neural mechanisms underlying CNP. Thus, inhibiting spinal astrocytic activation may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating CNP."
https://openalex.org/W1993689392,"Scavenging, a result of a temporary pulse of resources, occurs in virtually all ecosystems containing carnivores, and is an important energy transfer pathway that can impact ecosystem structure and function, and this ecological significance has largely been considered from a terrestrial standpoint; however, little is known about the role of scavenging in shaping the behavioral ecology of marine species, specifically apex predators. Here we present findings from multiple opportunistic observations of white sharks scavenging on whale carcasses in False Bay, South Africa. Observations of white sharks scavenging over successive days provided evidence of strategic and selective scavenging by this species. Moreover, extended daily observations permitted recordings of unique social, aggregative, and feeding behaviors. We further compare these data against observations of natural predation by sharks on seals in the study area. We discuss these data in relation to environmental conditions, shark social interactions, migration patterns, whale biology, and behaviorally-mediated trophic cascades. While the appearance of a whale carcass is largely a stochastic event, we propose that white shark scavenging on whales may represent an underestimated, yet significant component to the overall foraging ecology of this species, especially as individuals attain sexual maturity."
https://openalex.org/W2167520439,"ERBB2, a receptor tyrosine kinase amplified in breast cancer, is a well established regulator of tumor growth in vivo and anoikis resistance leading to disruption of architecture in three-dimensional mammary epithelial acinar structures in vitro. ERBB2 promotes anoikis resistance by maintaining signaling pathways and by rescuing metabolic defects and thus inhibiting accumulation of deleterious reactive oxygen species. Recent evidence suggests that hypoxia, via hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), can inhibit anoikis; thus, we hypothesized that HIF-1 may play a role in ERBB2-mediated anoikis resistance and oncogenesis. Indeed, tumors isolated from MMTV-Neu mice contain elevated HIF-1α levels and tumor cells created from MMTV-Neu mice harboring deletion of Hif1α alleles reduced primary tumor growth in vivo. ERBB2 overexpressing cancer cells stabilize HIF under normoxic conditions and require HIF-1 for ERBB2-mediated anchorage-independence, three-dimensional culture growth and anoikis resistance. HIF-1 reduction in ERBB2 cells was associated with induction of the pro-anoikis protein BIM and decreased ERK and AKT signaling during cell detachment. ERBB2-mediated inhibition of metabolic defects, including decreased reactive oxygen species generation in suspension, required HIF-1 expression that was critical for ERBB2-mediated oncogenesis. Gene expression profiling of hypoxic three-dimensional acinar structures identified a number of genes elevated in response to hypoxia that are known ERBB2 targets, suggesting that hypoxic conditions and ERBB2 overexpression share both phenotypic and genetic components via HIF-1 regulation. Thus, our data demonstrate that ERBB2 requires HIF-1 for tumor growth and suggest that HIF is a major downstream regulator of ERBB2 that protects cells from anoikis and metabolic stress caused by decreased matrix adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2041541066,"In modeling individuals vaccination decision making, existing studies have typically used the payoff-based (e.g., game-theoretical) approaches that evaluate the risks and benefits of vaccination. In reality, whether an individual takes vaccine or not is also influenced by the decisions of others, i.e., due to the impact of social influence. In this regard, we present a dual-perspective view on individuals decision making that incorporates both the cost analysis of vaccination and the impact of social influence. In doing so, we consider a group of individuals making their vaccination decisions by both minimizing the associated costs and evaluating the decisions of others. We apply social impact theory (SIT) to characterize the impact of social influence with respect to individuals interaction relationships. By doing so, we propose a novel modeling framework that integrates an extended SIT-based characterization of social influence with a game-theoretical analysis of cost minimization. We consider the scenario of voluntary vaccination against an influenza-like disease through a series of simulations. We investigate the steady state of individuals’ decision making, and thus, assess the impact of social influence by evaluating the coverage of vaccination for infectious diseases control. Our simulation results suggest that individuals high conformity to social influence will increase the vaccination coverage if the cost of vaccination is low, and conversely, will decrease it if the cost is high. Interestingly, if individuals are social followers, the resulting vaccination coverage would converge to a certain level, depending on individuals’ initial level of vaccination willingness rather than the associated costs. We conclude that social influence will have an impact on the control of an infectious disease as they can affect the vaccination coverage. In this respect, our work can provide a means for modeling the impact of social influence as well as for estimating the effectiveness of a voluntary vaccination program."
https://openalex.org/W2072891907,"Biological networks, such as genetic regulatory networks, often contain positive and negative feedback loops that settle down to dynamically stable patterns. Identifying these patterns, the so-called attractors, can provide important insights for biologists to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying many coordinated cellular processes such as cellular division, differentiation, and homeostasis. Both synchronous and asynchronous Boolean networks have been used to simulate genetic regulatory networks and identify their attractors. The common methods of computing attractors are that start with a randomly selected initial state and finish with exhaustive search of the state space of a network. However, the time complexity of these methods grows exponentially with respect to the number and length of attractors. Here, we build two algorithms to achieve the computation of attractors in synchronous and asynchronous Boolean networks. For the synchronous scenario, combing with iterative methods and reduced order binary decision diagrams (ROBDD), we propose an improved algorithm to compute attractors. For another algorithm, the attractors of synchronous Boolean networks are utilized in asynchronous Boolean translation functions to derive attractors of asynchronous scenario. The proposed algorithms are implemented in a procedure called geneFAtt. Compared to existing tools such as genYsis, geneFAtt is significantly faster in computing attractors for empirical experimental systems.

https://openalex.org/W1968618363,"Human LYNX1, belonging to the Ly6/neurotoxin family of three-finger proteins, is membrane-tethered with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and modulates the activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Recent preparation of LYNX1 as an individual protein in the form of water-soluble domain lacking glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (ws-LYNX1; Lyukmanova, E. N., Shenkarev, Z. O., Shulepko, M. A., Mineev, K. S., D'Hoedt, D., Kasheverov, I. E., Filkin, S. Y., Krivolapova, A. P., Janickova, H., Dolezal, V., Dolgikh, D. A., Arseniev, A. S., Bertrand, D., Tsetlin, V. I., and Kirpichnikov, M. P. (2011) NMR structure and action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of water-soluble domain of human LYNX1. J. Biol. Chem. 286, 10618-10627) revealed the attachment at the agonist-binding site in the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) and muscle nAChR but outside it, in the neuronal nAChRs. Here, we obtained a series of ws-LYNX1 mutants (T35A, P36A, T37A, R38A, K40A, Y54A, Y57A, K59A) and examined by radioligand analysis or patch clamp technique their interaction with the AChBP, Torpedo californica nAChR and chimeric receptor composed of the α7 nAChR extracellular ligand-binding domain and the transmembrane domain of α1 glycine receptor (α7-GlyR). Against AChBP, there was either no change in activity (T35A, T37A), slight decrease (K40A, K59A), and even enhancement for the rest mutants (most pronounced for P36A and R38A). With both receptors, many mutants lost inhibitory activity, but the increased inhibition was observed for P36A at α7-GlyR. Thus, there are subtype-specific and common ws-LYNX1 residues recognizing distinct targets. Because ws-LYNX1 was inactive against glycine receptor, its ""non-classical"" binding sites on α7 nAChR should be within the extracellular domain. Micromolar affinities and fast washout rates measured for ws-LYNX1 and its mutants are in contrast to nanomolar affinities and irreversibility of binding for α-bungarotoxin and similar snake α-neurotoxins also targeting α7 nAChR. This distinction may underlie their different actions, i.e. nAChRs modulation versus irreversible inhibition, for these two types of three-finger proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2035808799,"Galectin-9 ameliorates various murine autoimmune disease models by regulating T cells and macrophages, although it is not known what role it may have in B cells. The present experiment shows that galectin-9 ameliorates a variety of clinical symptoms, such as proteinuria, arthritis, and hematocrit in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice. As previously reported, galectin-9 reduces the frequency of Th1, Th17, and activated CD8+ T cells. Although anti-dsDNA antibody was increased in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice, galectin-9 suppressed anti-dsDNA antibody production, at least partly, by decreasing the number of plasma cells. Galectin-9 seemed to decrease the number of plasma cells by inducing plasma cell apoptosis, and not by suppressing BAFF production. Although about 20% of CD19−/low CD138+ plasma cells expressed Tim-3 in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice, Tim-3 may not be directly involved in the galectin-9-induced apoptosis, because anti-Tim-3 blocking antibody did not block galectin-9-induced apoptosis. This is the first report of plasma cell apoptosis being induced by galectin-9. Collectively, it is likely that galectin-9 attenuates the clinical severity of MRL lupus-prone mice by regulating T cell function and inducing plasma cell apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2003559282,"This study was designed to investigate the expression profile of CYGB, its potential neuroprotective function, and underlying molecular mechanisms using a model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) brain injury. Cygb mRNA and protein expression were evaluated within the first 36 h after the HI model was induced using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cygb mRNA expression was increased at 18 h in a time-dependent manner, and its level of protein expression increased progressively in 24 h. To verify the neuroprotective effect of CYGB, a gene transfection technique was employed. Cygb cDNA and shRNA delivery adenovirus systems were established (Cygb-cDNA-ADV and Cygb-shRNA-ADV, respectively) and injected into the brains of 3-day-old rats 4 days before they were induced with HI treatment. Rats from different groups were euthanized 24 h post-HI, and brain samples were harvested. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride, TUNEL, and Nissl staining indicated that an up-regulation of CYGB resulted in reduced acute brain injury. The superoxide dismutase level was found to be dependent on expression of CYGB. The Morris water maze test in 28-day-old rats demonstrated that CYGB expression was associated with improvement of long term cognitive impairment. Studies also demonstrated that CYGB can up-regulate mRNA and protein levels of VEGF and increase both the density and diameter of the microvessels but inhibits activation of caspase-2 and -3. Thus, this is the first in vivo study focusing on the neuroprotective role of CYGB. The reduction of neonatal HI injury by CYGB may be due in part to antioxidant and antiapoptotic mechanisms and by promoting angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2016836820,"In Alzheimer disease (AD), the microtubule-associated protein tau is highly phosphorylated and aggregates into characteristic neurofibrillary tangles. Prostate-derived sterile 20-like kinases (PSKs/TAOKs) 1 and 2, members of the sterile 20 family of kinases, have been shown to regulate microtubule stability and organization. Here we show that tau is a good substrate for PSK1 and PSK2 phosphorylation with mass spectrometric analysis of phosphorylated tau revealing more than 40 tau residues as targets of these kinases. Notably, phosphorylated residues include motifs located within the microtubule-binding repeat domain on tau (Ser-262, Ser-324, and Ser-356), sites that are known to regulate tau-microtubule interactions. PSK catalytic activity is enhanced in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, areas of the brain that are most susceptible to Alzheimer pathology, in comparison with the cerebellum, which is relatively spared. Activated PSK is associated with neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites surrounding neuritic plaques, neuropil threads, and granulovacuolar degeneration bodies in AD brain. By contrast, activated PSKs and phosphorylated tau are rarely detectible in immunostained control human brain. Our results demonstrate that tau is a substrate for PSK and suggest that this family of kinases could contribute to the development of AD pathology and dementia."
https://openalex.org/W2096492353,"Although uncontrolled inflammatory response plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI), the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the development of this disorder remain poorly understood. SOCS3 is an important negative regulator of IL-6-type cytokine signaling. SOCS3 is induced in lung during LPS-induced lung injury, suggesting that generation of SOCS3 may represent a regulatory product during ALI. In the current study, we created mice lacking SOCS3 expression in macrophages and neutrophils (LysM-cre SOCS3fl/fl). We evaluated the lung inflammatory response to LPS in both LysM-cre SOCS3fl/fl mice and the wild-type (WT) mice (SOCS3fl/fl). LysM-cre SOCS3fl/fl mice displayed significant increase of the lung permeability index (lung vascular leak of albumin), neutrophils, lung neutrophil accumulation (myeloperoxidase activity), and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in bronchial alveolar lavage fluids compared to WT mice. These phenotypes were consistent with morphological evaluation of lung, which showed enhanced inflammatory cell influx and intra-alveolar hemorrhage. We further identify the transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) δ as a critical downstream target of SOCS3 in LPS-induced ALI. These results indicate that SOCS3 has a protective role in LPS-induced ALI by suppressing C/EBPδ activity in the lung. Elucidating the function of SOCS3 would represent prospective targets for a new generation of drugs needed to treat ALI.—Yan, C., Ward, P.

https://openalex.org/W2005488960,"Non-consumptive effects of predators on each other and on prey populations often exceed the effects of direct predation. These effects can arise from fear responses elevating glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels (predator stress hypothesis) or from increased vigilance that reduces foraging efficiency and body condition (predator sensitive foraging hypothesis); both responses can lead to immunosuppression and increased parasite loads. Non-consumptive effects of invasive predators have been little studied, even though their direct impacts on local species are usually greater than those of their native counterparts. To address this issue, we explored the non-consumptive effects of the invasive red fox Vulpes vulpes on two native species in eastern Australia: a reptilian predator, the lace monitor Varanus varius and a marsupial, the ringtail possum Pseudocheirus peregrinus. In particular, we tested predictions derived from the above two hypotheses by comparing the basal glucocorticoid levels, foraging behaviour, body condition and haemoparasite loads of both native species in areas with and without fox suppression. Lace monitors showed no GC response or differences in haemoparasite loads but were more likely to trade safety for higher food rewards, and had higher body condition, in areas of fox suppression than in areas where foxes remained abundant. In contrast, ringtails showed no physiological or behavioural differences between fox-suppressed and control areas. Predator sensitive foraging is a non-consumptive cost for lace monitors in the presence of the fox and most likely represents a response to competition. The ringtail’s lack of response to the fox potentially represents complete naiveté or strong and rapid selection to the invasive predator. We suggest evolutionary responses are often overlooked in interactions between native and introduced species, but must be incorporated if we are to understand the suite of forces that shape community assembly and function in the wake of biological invasions."
https://openalex.org/W1977927967,"Background The clinical consequences of co-infection with two or more respiratory viruses are poorly understood. We sought to determine if co-infection with pandemic 2009–2010 influenza A H1N1 (pH1N1) and another respiratory virus was associated with worse clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed of all hospitalized patients with a positive respiratory viral panel (RVP) for two or more viruses within 72 hours of admission at our institution from October 2009 to December 2009. We compared patients infected with one respiratory virus to those with respiratory viral co-infection. Results We identified 617 inpatients with a positive RVP sample with a single virus and 49 inpatients with a positive RVP sample for two viruses (i.e. co-infection). Co-infected patients were significantly younger, more often had fever/chills, tachypnea, and they more often demonstrated interstitial opacities suggestive of viral pneumonia on the presenting chest radiograph (OR 7.5, 95% CI 3.4–16.5). The likelihood of death, length of stay, and requirement for intensive care unit level of care were similar in both groups, but patients with any respiratory virus co-infection were more likely to experience complications, particularly treatment for a secondary bacterial pneumonia (OR 6.8, 95% CI 3.3–14.2). Patients co-infected with pH1N1 and another respiratory virus were more likely to present with chest radiograph changes suggestive of a viral pneumonia, compared to mono-infection with pH1N1 (OR 16.9, 95% CI 4.5–62.7). By logistic regression using mono-infection with non-PH1N1 viruses as the reference group, co-infection with pH1N1 was the strongest independent predictor of treatment for a secondary bacterial pneumonia (OR 17.8, 95% CI 6.7–47.1). Conclusion Patients with viral co-infection, particularly with pH1N1, were more likely to have chest radiograph features compatible with a viral pneumonia and complications during their hospital course, particularly treatment for secondary bacterial pneumonia. Despite this, co-infection was not associated with ICU admission."
https://openalex.org/W2024951855,"Memory may have evolved to preserve information processed in terms of its fitness-relevance. Based on the assumption that the human mind comprises different fitness-relevant adaptive mechanisms contributing to survival and reproductive success, we compared alternative fitness-relevant processing scenarios with survival processing. Participants rated words for relevancy to fitness-relevant and control conditions followed by a delay and surprise recall test (Experiment 1a). Participants recalled more words processed for their relevance to a survival situation. We replicated these findings in an online study (Experiment 2) and a study using revised fitness-relevant scenarios (Experiment 3). Across all experiments, we did not find a mnemonic benefit for alternative fitness-relevant processing scenarios, questioning assumptions associated with an evolutionary account of remembering. Based on these results, fitness-relevance seems to be too wide-ranging of a construct to account for the memory findings associated with survival processing. We propose that memory may be hierarchically sensitive to fitness-relevant processing instructions. We encourage future researchers to investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for survival processing effects and work toward developing a taxonomy of adaptive memory."
https://openalex.org/W2094129007,"Background Evidence suggests that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with substantially reduced subjective quality of life (SQOL). This study aimed to explore whether and how changes in the levels of PTSD symptom clusters of intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal are associated with changes in SQOL. Methods Two samples with PTSD following the war in former Yugoslavia were studied, i.e. a representative sample of 530 people in five Balkan countries and a non-representative sample of 215 refugees in three Western European countries. They were assessed on average eight years after the war and re-interviewed one year later. PTSD symptoms were assessed on the Impact of Event Scale - Revised and SQOL on the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life. Linear regression and a two-wave cross lagged panel analysis were used to explore the association between PTSD symptom clusters and SQOL. Results The findings in the two samples were consistent. Symptom reduction over time was associated with improved SQOL. In multivariable analyses adjusted for the influence of all three clusters, gender and time since war exposure, only changes in hyperarousal symptoms were significantly associated with changes in SQOL. The two-wave cross-lagged panel analysis suggested that the link between hyperarousal symptoms and SQOL is bidirectional. Conclusions Low SQOL of patients with war-related PTSD is particularly associated with hyperarousal symptoms. The findings suggest a bidirectional influence: a reduction in hyperarousal symptoms may result in improved SQOL, and improvements in SQOL may lead to reduced hyperarousal symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W1969842424,"Cigarette smoke (CS) has been reported to induce autophagy in airway epithelial cells. The subsequent autophagic cell death has been proposed to play an important pathogenic role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not entirely clear. Using CS extract (CSE) as a surrogate for CS, we found that it markedly increased the expressions of both LC3B-I and LC3B-II as well as autophagosomes in airway epithelial cells. This is in contrast to the common autophagy inducer (i.e., starvation) that increases LC3B-II but reduces LC3B-I. Further studies indicate that CSE regulated LC3B at transcriptional and post-translational levels. In addition, CSE, but not starvation, activated Nrf2-mediated adaptive response. Increase of cellular Nrf2 by either Nrf2 overexpression or the knockdown of Keap1 (an Nrf2 inhibitor) significantly repressed CSE-induced LC3B-I and II as well as autophagosomes. Supplement of NAC (a GSH precursor) or GSH recapitulated the effect of Nrf2, suggesting the increase of cellular GSH level is responsible for Nrf2 effect on LC3B and autophagosome. Interestingly, neither Nrf2 activation nor GSH supplement could restore the repressed activities of mTOR or its downstream effctor-S6K. Thus, the Nrf2-dependent autophagy-suppression was not due to the re-activation of mTOR-the master repressor of autophagy. To search for the downstream effector of Nrf2 on LC3B and autophagosome, we tested Nrf2-dependent genes (i.e., NQO1 and P62) that are also increased by CSE treatment. We found that P62, but not NQO1, could mimic the effect of Nrf2 activation by repressing LC3B expression. Thus, Nrf2->P62 appears to play an important role in the regulation of CSE-induced LC3B and autophagosome."
https://openalex.org/W2029942494,"The emerging link between iron metabolism and genome integrity is increasingly clear. Recent studies have revealed that MMS19 and cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) factors form a complex and have central roles in CIA pathway. However, the composition of the CIA complex, particularly the involvement of the Fe-S protein IOP1, is still unclear. The roles of each component are also largely unknown. Here, we show that MMS19, MIP18, and CIAO1 form a tight “core” complex and that IOP1 is an “external” component of this complex. Although IOP1 and the core complex form a complex both in vivo and in vitro, IOP1 behaves differently in vivo. A deficiency in any core component leads to down-regulation of all of the components. In contrast, IOP1 knockdown does not affect the level of any core component. In MMS19-overproducing cells, other core components are also up-regulated, but the protein level of IOP1 remains unchanged. IOP1 behaves like a target protein in the CIA reaction, like other Fe-S helicases, and the core complex may participate in the maturation process of IOP1. Alternatively, the core complex may catch and hold IOP1 when it becomes mature to prevent its degradation. In any case, IOP1 functions in the MMS19-dependent CIA pathway. We also reveal that MMS19 interacts with target proteins. MIP18 has a role to bridge MMS19 and CIAO1. CIAO1 also binds IOP1. Based on our in vivo and in vitro data, new models of the CIA machinery are proposed.Background: The CIA machinery in human cells is unclear.Results: MMS19 formed a complex with MIP18, CIAO1, and IOP1, but IOP1 behaved differently from the other components.Conclusion: The CIA complex consists of a core MMS19-MIP18-CIAO1 complex, and IOP1 is an external component of the CIA machinery.Significance: This study increases the understanding of the composition of the CIA machinery in human cells and the interactions between the components. The emerging link between iron metabolism and genome integrity is increasingly clear. Recent studies have revealed that MMS19 and cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) factors form a complex and have central roles in CIA pathway. However, the composition of the CIA complex, particularly the involvement of the Fe-S protein IOP1, is still unclear. The roles of each component are also largely unknown. Here, we show that MMS19, MIP18, and CIAO1 form a tight “core” complex and that IOP1 is an “external” component of this complex. Although IOP1 and the core complex form a complex both in vivo and in vitro, IOP1 behaves differently in vivo. A deficiency in any core component leads to down-regulation of all of the components. In contrast, IOP1 knockdown does not affect the level of any core component. In MMS19-overproducing cells, other core components are also up-regulated, but the protein level of IOP1 remains unchanged. IOP1 behaves like a target protein in the CIA reaction, like other Fe-S helicases, and the core complex may participate in the maturation process of IOP1. Alternatively, the core complex may catch and hold IOP1 when it becomes mature to prevent its degradation. In any case, IOP1 functions in the MMS19-dependent CIA pathway. We also reveal that MMS19 interacts with target proteins. MIP18 has a role to bridge MMS19 and CIAO1. CIAO1 also binds IOP1. Based on our in vivo and in vitro data, new models of the CIA machinery are proposed. Background: The CIA machinery in human cells is unclear. Results: MMS19 formed a complex with MIP18, CIAO1, and IOP1, but IOP1 behaved differently from the other components. Conclusion: The CIA complex consists of a core MMS19-MIP18-CIAO1 complex, and IOP1 is an external component of the CIA machinery. Significance: This study increases the understanding of the composition of the CIA machinery in human cells and the interactions between the components. DNA repair systems have evolved to function in coordination with other cellular metabolic pathways. A genetic framework for studying such coordinated mechanisms in eukaryotic cells was provided by the isolation and phenotypic characterization of mutant strains of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agents (1Prakash L. Prakash S. Isolation and characterization of MMS-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1977; 86: 33-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mms19 mutants were originally isolated in a screening for yeast mutants hypersensitive to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). 3The abbreviations used are: MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; NER, nucleotide excision repair; TF, transcription factor; CIA, cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly; MMC, mitomycin C. In addition, mms19 mutants exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes, including methionine auxotrophy, sporulation deficiency, and telomere abnormality (1Prakash L. Prakash S. Isolation and characterization of MMS-sensitive mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1977; 86: 33-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Askree S.H. Yehuda T. Smolikov S. Gurevich R. Hawk J.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and compromised nucleotide excision repair (NER) and temperature-sensitive defects in transcription (3Lauder S. Bankmann M. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Dual requirement for the yeast MMS19 gene in DNA repair and RNA polymerase II transcription.Mol. Cell.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae mms19 mutants are deficient in transcription-coupled and global nucleotide excision repair.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3974-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the roles of yeast Mms19 in the maintenance of eukaryotic genome integrity have remained poorly understood. Human MMS19 expressed in yeast can complement the mms19 phenotypes (5Queimado L. Rao M. Schultz R.A. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Nardo T. Stefanini M. Friedberg E.C. Cloning the human and mouse MMS19 genes and functional complementation of a yeast mms19 deletion mutant.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1884-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These phenotypes, which are reminiscent of those resulting from mutations in the basal transcription factor TFIIH, can be corrected in vitro by supplementing extracts with TFIIH but not with recombinant yeast Mms19 (3Lauder S. Bankmann M. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Dual requirement for the yeast MMS19 gene in DNA repair and RNA polymerase II transcription.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6783-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Human MMS19 directly interacts with the TFIIH components XPD and XPB, which are essential for normal NER (6Seroz T. Winkler G.S. Auriol J. Verhage R.A. Vermeulen W. Smit B. Brouwer J. Eker A.P. Weeda G. Egly J.M. Hoeijmakers J.H.

Yeast Mms19 itself apparently does not participate directly in NER because it is not required for a reconstituted in vitro NER system (7Araújo S.J. Tirode F. Coin F. Pospiech H. Syväoja J.E. Stucki M. Hübscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Nucleotide excision repair of DNA with recombinant human proteins: definition of the minimal set of factors, active forms of TFIIH, and modulation by CAK.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but recent studies by Kou et al. show that yeast Mms19 functions indirectly in NER by maintaining an adequate cellular concentration of the TFIIH subunit Rad3, a yeast counterpart of human XPD. However, the temperature-sensitive growth defect of mms19 is not rescued by artificially maintaining an adequate amount of Rad3, indicating that yeast Mms19 serves as a multifunctional regulator in the maintenance of genome integrity (8Kou H. Zhou Y. Gorospe R.M. Wang Z. Mms19 protein functions in nucleotide excision repair by sustaining an adequate cellular concentration of the TFIIH component Rad3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15714-15719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fe-S clusters are ancient versatile protein cofactors involved in multiple fundamental processes, including electron transfer, enzyme catalysis, and gene expression (9Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Iron-sulfur clusters: nature's modular, multipurpose structures.Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 10Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Structure, function, and formation of biological iron-sulfur clusters.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Fe-S clusters are used for transferring electrons, generating radicals, and stabilizing protein structures. An Fe-S cluster is involved in DNA damage recognition by the Escherichia coli MutY protein, which functions in oxidative DNA damage repair (11Porello S.L. Cannon M.J. David S.S.

Several nuclear helicases belonging to the XPD/Rad3 family contain Fe-S clusters (12Wu Y. Brosh Jr., R.M.

The crystal structure of one of these, XPD from archaea, revealed that the Fe-S cluster plays a role in maintaining the structure of XPD helicases (14Liu H. Rudolf J. Johnson K.A. McMahon S.A. Oke M.

The domain of XPD containing the Fe-S cluster has a wedge-like feature that is involved in DNA duplex separation during unwinding (13Rudolf J. Makrantoni V. Ingledew W.J. Stark M.J. White M.F.

Previously, we reported that human MMS19 and XPD form a novel TFIIH-independent protein complex, which we named MMXD, consisting of MMS19, XPD, MIP18, ANT2, and CIAO1 (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CIAO1 is involved in the late step of cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) (18Balk J. Aguilar Netz D.J. Tepper K. Pierik A.J. Lill R. The essential WD40 protein Cia1 is involved in a late step of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur protein assembly.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10833-10841Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, MMS19 was reported to form a complex with the CIA machinery. Here, we describe the composition of the complex, the interactions between the components in the complex, and the roles of each component. The HeLa, MCF7, and HEK293 cell lines were used in this study. Each cell line was cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG-His6-MMS19 were transfected with a pcDNA3 vector containing human HA-CIAO1. Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of G418. A vector-based RNAi approach (shRNA) was used to knock down MMS19 in HeLa cells. A gene-specific targeting sequence (shMMS19-KD1, GGATGAATTCCTACAGCTA) was cloned into the pSUPERIOR vector (Oligoengine) to obtain vector-encoded short hairpin constructs for RNAi. Another gene-specific targeting sequence (shMMS19-KD2, TGATGGCTTCTCTCTGCTCATGTCTGACT) and the expression vector pRS were purchased from OriGene. The FLAG-His6-MMS19 complex was purified from HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG-His6-MMS19 as described previously (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The complex between FLAG-His6-MMS19 and HA-CIAO1 was purified by sequential affinity purification with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by anti-HA agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), as described previously (19Takedachi A. Saijo M. Tanaka K. DDB2 complex-mediated ubiquitylation around DNA damage is oppositely regulated by XPC and Ku and contributes to the recruitment of XPA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2708-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins (1 pmol each) were incubated in NETN buffer (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml BSA for 3–4 h and pulled down with the appropriate affinity tag resins. After several washes, bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Sf9 cell extracts overexpressing FLAG-His6-MMS19, His-CIAO1, His-MIP18, and His-IOP1 were mixed and incubated for 3 h to form a complex. The MMS19 complex was then isolated by FLAG tag affinity purification and subjected to Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 (GE Healthcare) with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were plated in 10-cm dishes at a density of 1000–2000 cells/dish. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and irradiated with γ-rays at the indicated doses. For mitomycin C (MMC) and MMS treatment, cells were incubated with the indicated amount of the agent for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 1–2 weeks. The resulting colonies were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and counted using a binocular microscope. Cells were fractionated into the cytosol (fraction 1), membranes and organelles (fraction 2), nucleus (fraction 3), and cytoskeleton (fraction 4) using selected buffers from the Merck subcellular proteome extraction kit. Cells were treated with 0.5 μm MMC for 1 h to induce FANCD2 monoubiquitylation. The siRNA duplexes used in this study are listed below. siRNA duplexes specifically targeting MMS19, CIAO1, and IOP1 (Stealth RNA) and non-targeting control siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. All siRNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). The sequences of the siRNAs were as follows: CIAO1, AGUGGUUACACACUCAAAGUCAUCC; MMS19, UACGGAUGCCAACAAGCUGAAGCUG; and IOP1, AGCACGUGGAGAGACUGUACGGCAU. siRNA duplexes specifically targeting MIP18 and XPD (SMARTpool) were purchased from Dharmacon and were as described previously (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Knockdown efficiencies were verified by immunoblotting or real-time quantitative PCR using TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems). Antibodies against MMS19, MIP18, and XPD were described previously (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody against human CIAO1 was raised in rabbits. Other antibodies were purchased commercially: anti-FANCJ, anti-GAPDH, and anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich); anti-RTEL1 (D-20) and anti-POLE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-IOP1 (Abcam); anti-MLH1 (BD Pharmingen); anti-NUBP1 (Abnova); anti-RTEL1 (LifeSpan); anti-FANCD2 (Novus); and anti-PRIM2 (Cell Signaling). For some Western blot experiments, a rapid Western blot apparatus (Western Q, SciTrove) was used. Previously, we showed that MMS19-knockdown HeLa cells are sensitive to UV light (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To study the roles of MMS19 in DNA repair pathways further, we generated two independent shRNA-mediated MMS19-knockdown HeLa cell lines (shMMS19-KD clones 1 and 2) and measured their sensitivity to a range of DNA-damaging agents. Both clones behaved qualitatively similarly in all of the experiments described below. Compared with HeLa cells, shMMS19-KD cells exhibited hypersensitivity to the cross-linking agent MMC and moderate sensitivity to γ-rays and MMS (Fig. 1, C–E). The Fanconi anemia pathway is essential for repair of DNA interstrand cross-links. Central to the Fanconi anemia pathway is the monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 (20de Winter J.P. Joenje H. The genetic and molecular basis of Fanconi anemia.Mutat. Res. 2009; 668: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We found that FANCD2 was monoubiquitylated normally in MMS19-knockdown HeLa cells (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we focused on proteins that act downstream of FANCD2 in the DNA cross-link repair pathway. One such protein is FANCJ, a member of the XPD/Rad3 Fe-S helicase family (21Wu Y. Brosh Jr., R.M. FANCJ helicase operates in the Fanconi Anemia DNA repair pathway and the response to replicational stress.Curr. Mol. Med. 2009; 9: 470-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The level of XPD is reduced in MMS19-knockdown cells (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), prompting us to investigate the level of FANCJ in these cells. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), the levels of FANCJ were markedly reduced in shMMS19-KD cells compared with WT cells. RTEL1, another member of the XPD/Rad3 Fe-S helicase family, is required for telomere maintenance and homologous recombination (22Barber L.J. Youds J.L. Ward J.D. McIlwraith M.J. O'Neil N.J. Petalcorin M.I. Martin J.S. Collis S.J. Cantor S.B. Auclair M. Tissenbaum H. West S.C. Rose A.M. Boulton S.J. RTEL1 maintains genomic stability by suppressing homologous recombination.Cell. 2008; 135: 261-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar); the levels of RTEL1 were also decreased in shMMS19-KD cells (Fig. 1, A and B). DDX11 is another member of the Fe-S cluster-containing DNA helicase family, and it is involved in sister chromatid cohesion and unwinding of the intermediates of DNA replication and recombination. As with the other helicases, the levels of DDX11 were significantly decreased in shMMS19-KD cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Studies in yeast suggest that MMS19 deficiency affects the general transcription level in human cells (3Lauder S. Bankmann M. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Dual requirement for the yeast MMS19 gene in DNA repair and RNA polymerase II transcription.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6783-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Kou H. Zhou Y. Gorospe R.M. Wang Z. Mms19 protein functions in nucleotide excision repair by sustaining an adequate cellular concentration of the TFIIH component Rad3.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15714-15719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the mRNA levels of Fe-S helicases in MMS19-deficient cells. No relative reduction compared with the control mRNA level was observed (Fig. 1F). We investigated whether MMS19 interacts directly with FANCJ or RTEL1. To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using whole-cell extracts derived from MCF7 breast cancer cells. Anti-FANCJ antibody precipitated MMS19 from whole-cell extracts (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), whereas neither FANCJ nor MMS19 was precipitated when normal rabbit IgG was used (lane 2). In control experiments, MLH1, a known binding partner of FANCJ (23Peng M. Litman R. Xie J. Sharma S. Brosh Jr., R.M. Cantor S.B. The FANCJ/MutLα interaction is required for correction of the cross-link response in FA-J cells.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3238-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-FANCJ antibody. MMS19 was also co-immunoprecipitated with anti-RTEL1 antibody in a manner dependent on antibody concentration (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). Similar effects were observed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2E). Next, we expressed FLAG-His6-MMS19 protein in HEK293 cells and performed affinity purification of whole-cell extracts (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Immunoblots revealed that the FLAG-His6-MMS19 complex contained FANCJ, XPD, and CIAO1 (Fig. 2B, lane 4). The yeast ortholog of CIAO1, Cia1, interacts with Nar1 (18Balk J. Aguilar Netz D.J. Tepper K. Pierik A.J. Lill R. The essential WD40 protein Cia1 is involved in a late step of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur protein assembly.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10833-10841Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Urzica E. Pierik A.J. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Crucial role of conserved cysteine residues in the assembly of two iron-sulfur clusters on the CIA protein Nar1.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4946-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nar1 is the yeast ortholog of human IOP1 and is also known as a CIA factor. Consistent with those observations, we also identified human IOP1 in the FLAG-His6-MMS19 complex (Fig. 2B). In contrast, we did not detect the NUBP1-NUBP2 complex (Fig. 2B), which functions at an earlier stage in CIA pathway (25Stehling O. Netz D.J. Niggemeyer B. Rösser R. Eisenstein R.S. Puccio H. Pierik A.J. Lill R. Human Nbp35 is essential for both cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly and iron homeostasis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5517-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). XPD, FANCJ, and RTEL1 normally function in the nucleus, so we examined the subcellular localization of these helicases in shMMS19-KD cells (clone 1). FANCJ, RTEL1, and XPD proteins were present predominantly in the nuclear fraction in both shMMS19-KD and WT cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, MMS19 does not affect the nuclear localization of Fe-S helicases. In MMS19-knockdown HEK293 cells, the protein levels of CIAO1, MIP18, and IOP1 were markedly decreased (Fig. 3A). A similar decrease in protein levels was observed when CIAO1 and MIP18 were knocked down. In contrast, the protein levels of MMS19, MIP18, and CIAO1 were not affected by the knockdown of IOP1 (Fig. 3A). Next, we examined the protein levels of CIAO1, MIP18, and IOP1 in HEK293 cells overexpressing FLAG-His6-MMS19. The protein levels of CIAO1 and MIP18 were markedly elevated in these cells (Fig. 3B), whereas the levels of IOP1, XPD, and FANCJ were unchanged (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that MMS19 forms a stable complex with CIAO1, MIP18, and IOP1, although IOP1 behaves somewhat differently. To further analyze the roles of MMS19 and other proteins in CIA, we isolated MMS19 and CIAO1 as a complex from HEK293 cells overexpressing both FLAG-His6-MMS19 and HA-CIAO1 by affinity purification using anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3, C and D). Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the MMS19-CIAO1 complex contains IOP1 and MIP18 (Fig. 3D). The MMS19-CIAO1 complex was stable even under high salt concentrations (Fig. 3D, lane 3). We also tested whether Fe-S helicases and other Fe-S proteins in the nucleus interact with this complex. XPD and FANCJ, as well as two other Fe-S proteins working in DNA replication called POLE and PRIM2, were also identified (Fig. 3E). To further elucidate the complex composition and the roles of each component, all factors were independently purified from extracts of Sf9 cells overexpressing each protein (Fig. 4A). The complex composition was examined by gel filtration analysis, and a complex consisting of all the four proteins (MMS19, MIP18, CIAO1, and IOP1) was predominantly formed (Fig. 4B). These results provide further support for the idea that MMS19 forms a complex with CIAO1, MIP18, and IOP1. Next, we investigated direct interactions within the complex by examining pairwise interactions between purified components. FLAG-His6-MMS19 interacted with His6-MIP18, as reported previously (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We observed a weak interaction between FLAG-His6-MMS19 and His6-IOP1 (Fig. 4C), but no interaction between FLAG-His6-MMS19 and His6-CIAO1. When His6-HA-CIAO1 was used as the bait instead of FLAG-His6-MMS19, we observed a strong interaction between His6-HA-CIAO1 and His6-MIP18 (Fig. 4D). His6-IOP1 interacted with His6-HA-CIAO1 weakly, and we observed no interaction between His6-HA-CIAO1 and FLAG-His6-MMS19. To examine the interaction of the target proteins with the MMS19 complex components, we used FLAG-V5-His6-XPD and His6-FANCJ-HA as baits. As reported previously (16Wolski S.C. Kuper J. Hänzelmann P. Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Crystal structure of the FeS cluster-containing nucleotide excision repair helicase XPD.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e149Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), FLAG-V5-His6-XPD interacted with FLAG-His6-MMS19 and His6-MIP18 (Fig. 4E). We observed a strong interaction between FLAG-V5-His6-XPD and His6-CIAO1. Next, we used another Fe-S helicase, FANCJ, as a bait. His6-FANCJ-HA interacted with FLAG-His6-MMS19, but an interaction between His6-FANCJ-HA and His6-CIAO1 was not observed (Fig. 4F). In this study, we found that MMS19-knockdown cells are hypersensitive to MMC and moderately sensitive to γ-rays and MMS (Fig. 1, C–E), in addition to the UV sensitivity and abnormal chromosome segregation we reported previously (17Ito S. Tan L.J. Andoh D. Narita T. Seki M. Hirano Y. Narita K. Kuraoka I. Hiraoka Y. Tanaka K. MMXD, a TFIIH-independent XPD-MMS19 protein complex involved in chromosome segregation.Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 632-640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The protein levels of the Fe-S cluster-containing DNA helicase family members FANCJ, RTEL1, DDX11, and XPD are decreased in MMS19-knockdown cells. MMS19 forms a complex with MIP18, CIAO1, and IOP1, and this complex contributes to the CIA machinery. These results suggest that the pleiotropic phenotypes of MMS19-knockdown cells might be explained by decreased levels of the Fe-S proteins due to a defect in CIA. The levels of the XPD/Rad3 Fe-S helicase family members FANCJ, XPD, DDX11, and RTEL1 were decreased in MMS19-knockdown cells (Fig. 1B). FANCJ and RTEL1 are required for DNA cross-link repair; thus, the decreased levels of these proteins may explain the hypersensitivity of MMS19-knockdown cells to MMC (22Barber L.J. Youds J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2008531705,"Renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) is the common pathological process of chronic kidney diseases leading inevitably to renal function deterioration. RIF and its preceding epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are commonly triggered by an early occurring renal inflammation. However, an effective approach to prevent EMT and RIF is still lacking and of urgent need. Recently, the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) emerges as a novel inflammation regulator, therefore manipulation of A2AR may suppress the EMT process and as such protect against RIF. To test this hypothesis we applied a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model of RIF on A2AR knockout mice and their wild-type littermates, combined with the intervention of a selective A2AR agonist, CGS 21680. On days 3, 7 and 14 post-UUO we evaluated the effects of A2AR manipulation on the molecular pathological progresses of RIF, including the cellular component of interstitial infiltration, expression of profibrotic factors, cellular biomarkers of EMT, and collagen deposition of extracellular matrix. Our data demonstrated that activation of A2AR significantly suppressed the deposition of collagen types I and III, reduced the infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes, and attenuated the expression of TGF-β1 and ROCK1, which in turn inhibited and postponed the EMT progress. Conversely, genetic inactivation of A2AR exacerbated the aforementioned pathological processes of UUO-induced RIF. Together, activation of A2AR effectively alleviated EMT and RIF in mice, suggesting A2AR as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of RIF."
https://openalex.org/W2018738506,"Objective Molar intrusion by mini-screw implantation can cause different degrees of root resorption. However, most methods (2-D and 3-D) used for evaluating root resorption have focused on the root length without considering 3-D resorption. The purpose of this study was to volumetrically evaluate root resorption using cone beam computed tomography(CBCT) after mini-screw implant intrusion. Materials and Methods 1. The volumes of 32 teeth were measured using CBCT and laser scanning to verify the accuracy of CBCT. 2. Twelve overerupted molars from adult patients were investigated in this study. After mini-screw implants were inserted into the buccal and palatal alveolar bones, 150 g of force was applied to the mini-screw implants on each side to intrude the molars. CBCT images of all patients were taken immediately prior to intrusion and after intrusion. The volumes of the roots were calculated using the Mimics software program. The differences between the pre-intrusion and post-intrusion root volumes were statistically evaluated with a paired-samples t-test. In addition, the losses of the roots were statistically compared with each other using one-way analysis of variance at the P<0.05 level. Results No statistically significant volume differences were observed between the physical (laser scanning) and CBCT measurements (P>0.05). The overerupted molars were significantly intruded (P<0.05), and the average intrusion was 3.30±1.60 mm. The differences between the pre-intrusion and post-intrusion root volumes were statistically significant for all of the roots investigated (P<0.05). The roots were sorted by volume loss in descending order as follows: mesiobuccal, palatal, and distobuccal. Statistical significance was achieved among the three roots. The average total resorption for each tooth was 58.39±1.54 mm3. Conclusion Volume measurement using CBCT was able to effectively evaluate root resorption caused by mini-screw intrusion. The highest volume loss was observed in the mesiobuccal root among the three roots of the investigated first molar teeth."
https://openalex.org/W2049147669,"The choroid plexus (CP) are highly vascularized branched structures that protrude into the ventricles of the brain, and form a unique interface between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the blood-CSF barrier, that are the main site of production and secretion of CSF. Sex hormones are widely recognized as neuroprotective agents against several neurodegenerative diseases, and the presence of sex hormones cognate receptors suggest that it may be a target for these hormones. In an effort to provide further insight into the neuroprotective mechanisms triggered by sex hormones we analyzed gene expression differences in the CP of female and male rats subjected to gonadectomy, using microarray technology. In gonadectomized female and male animals, 3045 genes were differentially expressed by 1.5-fold change, compared to sham controls. Analysis of the CP transcriptome showed that the top-five pathways significantly regulated by the sex hormone background are olfactory transduction, taste transduction, metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and circadian rhythm pathways. These results represent the first overview of global expression changes in CP of female and male rats induced by gonadectomy and suggest that sex hormones are implicated in pathways with central roles in CP functions and CSF homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2071777729,"We have successfully delivered a reactive alkylating agent, chlorambucil (Cbl), to the mitochondria of mammalian cells. Here, we characterize the mechanism of cell death for mitochondria-targeted chlorambucil (mt-Cbl) in vitro and assess its efficacy in a xenograft mouse model of leukemia. Using a ρ° cell model, we show that mt-Cbl toxicity is not dependent on mitochondrial DNA damage. We also illustrate that re-targeting Cbl to mitochondria results in a shift in the cell death mechanism from apoptosis to necrosis, and that this behavior is a general feature of mitochondria-targeted Cbl. Despite the change in cell death mechanisms, we show that mt-Cbl is still effective in vivo and has an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to the parent drug. These findings illustrate that mitochondrial rerouting changes the site of action of Cbl and also alters the cell death mechanism drastically without compromising in vivo efficacy. Thus, mitochondrial delivery allows the exploitation of Cbl as a promiscuous mitochondrial protein inhibitor with promising therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2062200817,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is up-regulated during mesothelial to mesenchymal transition (MMT) and has been associated with peritoneal membrane dysfunction in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. It has been shown that normal and malignant mesothelial cells (MCs) express VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and co-receptors and that VEGF is an autocrine growth factor for mesothelioma. Hence, we evaluated the expression patterns and the functional relevance of the VEGF/VEGFRs/co-receptors axis during the mesenchymal conversion of MCs induced by peritoneal dialysis. Omentum-derived MCs treated with TGF-β1 plus IL-1β (in vitro MMT) and PD effluent-derived MCs with non-epithelioid phenotype (ex vivo MMT) showed down-regulated expression of the two main receptors Flt-1/VEGFR-1 and KDR/VEGFR-2, whereas the co-receptor neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) was up-regulated. The expression of the Nrp-1 ligand semaphorin-3A (Sema-3A), a functional VEGF competitor, was repressed throughout the MMT process. These expression pattern changes were accompanied by a reduction of the proliferation capacity and by a parallel induction of the invasive capacity of MCs that had undergone an in vitro or ex vivo MMT. Treatment with neutralizing anti-VEGF or anti-Nrp-1 antibodies showed that these molecules played a relevant role in cellular proliferation only in naïve omentum-derived MCs. Conversely, treatment with these blocking antibodies, as well as with recombinant Sema-3A, indicated that the switched VEGF/VEGFRs/co-receptors axis drove the enhanced invasion capacity of MCs undergoing MMT. In conclusion, the expression patterns of VEGFRs and co-receptors change in MCs during MMT, which in turn would determine their behaviour in terms of proliferation and invasion in response to VEGF."
https://openalex.org/W2069042134,"Integrins in effector T cells are highly expressed and important for trafficking of these cells and for their effector functions. However, how integrins are regulated in effector T cells remains poorly characterized. Here, we have investigated effector T cell leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) regulation in primary murine effector T cells. These cells have high LFA-1 integrin expression and display high spontaneous binding to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) ligand under static conditions. In addition, these cells are able to migrate spontaneously on ICAM-1. Atomic force microscopy measurements showed that the force required for unbinding of integrin-ligand interactions increases over time (0.5–20-s contact time). The maximum unbinding force for this interaction was ∼140 piconewtons at 0.5-s contact time, increasing to 580 piconewtons at 20-s contact time. Also, the total work required to disrupt the interaction increased over the 20-s contact time, indicating LFA-1-mediated adhesion strengthening in primary effector T cells over a very quick time frame. Effector T cells adhered spontaneously to ICAM-1 under conditions of shear flow, in the absence of chemokine stimulation, and this binding was independent of protein kinase B/Akt and protein kinase C kinase activity, but dependent on calcium/calmodulin signaling and an intact actin cytoskeleton.

https://openalex.org/W1965661929,"Children and adolescents with a chronic illness have potential risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. An optimal vitamin D status might have multiple health effects. This study evaluated vitamin D status and its association with age, gender, and season in a large cohort of chronically ill Finnish patients at a tertiary pediatric outpatient clinic. A cross-sectional register-based study was carried out, involving altogether 1351 children (51% boys, age range 0.2-18 years), who visited the outpatient clinic during 2007-2010 and had their vitamin D status (S-25-OHD) determined. A post-doc analysis was conducted to identify predisposing and preventing factors for vitamin D deficiency.Almost half (47%) of the S-25-OHD values were consistent with subnormal vitamin D status (S-25-OHD <50 nmol/L) while only 12% were >80 nmol/L. Age and season were the most important determinants for S-25-OHD concentration. Mean S-25-OHD concentration differed between age groups (Kruskal-Wallis; p<0.001), adolescents being at highest risk for vitamin D insufficiency. Young age and vitamin D supplementation were preventive factors for deficiency, while non-Finnish ethnic background was a predisposing factor. S-25-OHD showed significant seasonal variation in children older than 6 years. In the whole cohort, S-25-OHD was on average 13 nmol/L higher in summer than in winter, and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency ( = S-25-OHD <37.5 nmol/l) varied from 11% in summer to 29% in winter.The finding that almost half of the studied Finnish children with a chronic illness had suboptimal vitamin D status is alarming. Inferior vitamin D status was noted in adolescents compared with younger children, suggesting that imbalance between intake and requirement evolves with age. Although less common during summer, subnormal vitamin D status was still observed in 28% of those evaluated in summer. Clinicians should identify individuals at risk and actively recommend vitamin D supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2012488173,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) isolated from several organisms have been receiving much attention due to some specific features that allow them to interact with, bind to, and disrupt cell membranes. The aim of this paper was to study the interactions between a membrane mimetic and the cationic AMP Ctx(Ile(21))-Ha as well as analogues containing the paramagnetic amino acid 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid (TOAC) incorporated at residue positions n = 0, 2, and 13. Circular dichroism studies showed that the peptides, except for [TOAC(13)]Ctx(Ile(21))-Ha, are unstructured in aqueous solution but acquire different amounts of α-helical secondary structure in the presence of trifluorethanol and lysophosphocholine micelles. Fluorescence experiments indicated that all peptides were able to interact with LPC micelles. In addition, Ctx(Ile(21))-Ha and [TOAC(13)]Ctx(Ile(21))-Ha peptides presented similar water accessibility for the Trp residue located near the N-terminal sequence. Electron spin resonance experiments showed two spectral components for [TOAC(0)]Ctx(Ile(21))-Ha, which are most likely due to two membrane-bound peptide conformations. In contrast, TOAC(2) and TOAC(13) derivatives presented a single spectral component corresponding to a strong immobilization of the probe. Thus, our findings allowed the description of the peptide topology in the membrane mimetic, where the N-terminal region is in dynamic equilibrium between an ordered, membrane-bound conformation and a disordered, mobile conformation; position 2 is most likely situated in the lipid polar head group region, and residue 13 is fully inserted into the hydrophobic core of the membrane."

It can affect a wide variety of biological processes in insects, including innate immune, Ca(2+) channel in cells, and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Dtxs have been used as biological control agent for a long time, however, their molecular mechanism of action is still unknown.In this study, both digital gene expression (DGE) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) approaches were adopted to examine the effects of dtx A on Plutella xyllostella (L.) larvae. By using DGE and 2-DE analyses, 1584 genes and 42 protein points were identified as being up- or down regulated at least 2-fold in response to dtx A. Firstly, injection of dtx A to larvae accelerated the increase of peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP), which could activate the Toll signal pathway inducing production of antibacterial substances such as cecropin and gloverin. Dtx A also stimulated prophenoloxidase (proPO) system which plays an important role in innate immunity and leads to melanization of external organisms. Secondly, dtx A suppressed the expression of genes related to the Toll pathway, and induced expression of serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins), especially the serpin 2 that blocked process of the proPO system. Finally, other physiological process like xenobiotics detoxification, apoptosis, calcium signaling pathway and insect hormone biosynthesis, were also mediated in response to dtx A toxicity.Transcript and protein profiling analyses will provide an insight into the potential molecular mechanism of action in P. xylostella larvae in response to dtx A."
https://openalex.org/W2074016345,"Background Glioma rates vary by demographic factors and geo-political boundaries and this variation suggests higher glioma rates in groups of higher socioeconomic position. The primary goal of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between glioma and county socioeconomic position using U.S. Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data. Methods Cases were individuals 25+ years diagnosed with glioma between 2000 and 2006 and residing within the SEER-17 catchment area. County-, sex-, race-, age-specific rates were created in order to investigate individual-level associations (population data from U.S. Census 2000). A Bayesian hierarchical Poisson spatial conditionally autoregressive (CAR) model was utilized to simultaneously estimate individual- and county-level associations while controlling for county spatial dependence. Results Those residing in counties of the second, third, and fourth highest quartiles of socioeconomic position have glioma incidence rates that are 1.10 (95% CI: 1.02,1.19), 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02,1.20), 1.14 (95% CI: 1.05,1.23) times that of the first quartile, respectively. A CAR model properly controlled for error spatial dependence. Investigated lag times suggest year 2000 census data yields superior model fit. Conclusion Demographically adjusted rates of glioma are elevated in counties of higher socioeconomic position. More well-grounded theory concerning the glioma-socioeconomic position association along with socioeconomic data collected at multiple levels is recommended for future studies investigating this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2171199105,"As essential components of the molecular machine assembling heterochromatin in eukaryotes, HP1 (Heterochromatin Protein 1) proteins are key regulators of genome function. While several high-resolution structures of the two globular regions of HP1, chromo and chromoshadow domains, in their free form or in complex with recognition-motif peptides are available, less is known about the conformational behavior of the full-length protein. Here, we used NMR spectroscopy in combination with small angle X-ray scattering and dynamic light scattering to characterize the dynamic and structural properties of full-length human HP1β (hHP1β) in solution. We show that the hinge region is highly flexible and enables a largely unrestricted spatial search by the two globular domains for their binding partners. In addition, the binding pockets within the chromo and chromoshadow domains experience internal dynamics that can be useful for the versatile recognition of different binding partners. In particular, we provide evidence for the presence of a distinct structural propensity in free hHP1β that prepares a binding-competent interface for the formation of the intermolecular β-sheet with methylated histone H3. The structural plasticity of hHP1β supports its ability to bind and connect a wide variety of binding partners in epigenetic processes."
https://openalex.org/W1968295332,"Interleukin (IL) 33, a member of IL-1 cytokine family, is well known to promote Th2 type immune responses by signaling through its receptor ST2. However, it is not clear whether ST2 is expressed by mucosal epithelium, and how it responds to IL-33 to induce inflammatory mediators. This study was to identify the presence and function of ST2 and explore the role of IL-33/ST2 signaling in regulating the inflammatory cytokine production in corneal epithelial cells. Human corneal tissues and cultured primary human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) were treated with IL-33 in different concentrations without or with different inhibitors to evaluate the expression, location and signaling pathways of ST2 in regulating production of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine. The mRNA expression was determined by reverse transcription and real time PCR, and protein production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining. ST2 mRNA and protein were detected in donor corneal epithelium and cultured HCECs, and ST2 signal was enhanced by exposure to IL-33. IL-33 significantly stimulated the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) and chemokine IL-8 by HCECs at both mRNA and protein levels. The stimulated production of inflammatory mediators by IL-33 was blocked by ST2 antibody or soluble ST2 protein. Interestingly, the IκB-α inhibitor BAY11-7082 or NF-κB activation inhibitor quinazoline blocked NF-κB p65 protein phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and also suppressed the production of these inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induced by IL-33. These findings demonstrate that ST2 is present in human corneal epithelial cells, and IL-33/ST2 signaling plays an important role in regulating IL-33 induced inflammatory responses in ocular surface."
https://openalex.org/W2054832035,"Human cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients are frequently transplanted into immune-compromised mouse strains to provide an in vivo environment for studies on the biology of the disease. Since frequencies of leukemia re-initiating cells are low and a unique cell surface phenotype that includes all tumor re-initiating activity remains unknown, the underlying mechanisms leading to limitations in the xenotransplantation assay need to be understood and overcome to obtain robust engraftment of AML-containing samples. We report here that in the NSG xenotransplantation assay, the large majority of mononucleated cells from patients with AML fail to establish a reproducible myeloid engraftment despite high donor chimerism. Instead, donor-derived cells mainly consist of polyclonal disease-unrelated expanded co-transplanted human T lymphocytes that induce xenogeneic graft versus host disease and mask the engraftment of human AML in mice. Engraftment of mainly myeloid cell types can be enforced by the prevention of T cell expansion through the depletion of lymphocytes from the graft prior transplantation."

Through the analysis of the full-length cDNAs from a Eutreptiella species, we found a conserved 28-nt spliced leader sequence (Eut-SL, ACACUUUCUGAGUGUCUAUUUUUUUUCG) was trans-spliced to the mRNAs of Eutreptiella sp. Using a primer derived from Eut-SL, we constructed four cDNA libraries under contrasting physiological conditions for 454 pyrosequencing. Clustering analysis of the ∼1.9×106 original reads (average length 382 bp) yielded 36,643 unique transcripts. Although only 28% of the transcripts matched documented genes, this fraction represents a functionally very diverse gene set, suggesting that SL trans-splicing is likely ubiquitous in this alga’s transcriptome. The mRNAs of Eutreptiella sp. seemed to have short 5′- untranslated regions, estimated to be 21 nucleotides on average. Among the diverse biochemical pathways represented in the transcriptome we obtained, carbonic anhydrase and genes known to function in the C4 pathway and heterotrophic carbon fixation were found, posing a question whether Eutreptiella sp. employs multifaceted strategies to acquire and fix carbon efficiently. This first large-scale transcriptomic dataset for a euglenoid uncovers many potential novel genes and overall offers a valuable genetic resource for research on euglenoid algae."
https://openalex.org/W2013719793,"The INhibitor of Growth 1 (ING1) is stoichiometric member of histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes and functions as an epigenetic regulator and a type II tumor suppressor. It impacts cell growth, aging, apoptosis, and DNA repair, by affecting chromatin conformation and gene expression. Down regulation and mislocalization of ING1 have been reported in diverse tumor types and Ser/Thr phosphorylation has been implicated in both of these processes. Here we demonstrate that both in vitro and in vivo, the tyrosine kinase Src is able to physically associate with, and phosphorylate ING1, which results in a nuclear to cytoplasmic relocalization of ING1 in cells and a decrease of ING1 stability. Functionally, Src antagonizes the ability of ING1 to induce apoptosis, most likely through relocalization of ING1 and down regulation of ING1 levels. These effects were due to both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent properties of Src, and were most apparent at elevated levels of Src expression. These findings suggest that Src may play a major role in regulating ING1 levels during tumorigenesis in those cancers in which high levels of Src expression or activity are present. These data represent the first report of tyrosine kinase-mediated regulation of ING1 levels and suggest that kinase activation can impact chromatin structure through the ING1 epigenetic regulator."

https://openalex.org/W2000086947,"Expansion of CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causes certain familial neurological disorders. Hairpin formation in the nascent strand during DNA synthesis is considered a major path for CAG/CTG repeat expansion. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. We show here that removal or retention of a nascent strand hairpin during DNA synthesis depends on hairpin structures and types of DNA polymerases. Polymerase (pol) δ alone removes the 3'-slipped hairpin using its 3'-5' proofreading activity when the hairpin contains no immediate 3' complementary sequences. However, in the presence of pol β, pol δ preferentially facilitates hairpin retention regardless of hairpin structures. In this reaction, pol β incorporates several nucleotides to the hairpin 3'-end, which serves as an effective primer for the continuous DNA synthesis by pol δ, thereby leading to hairpin retention and repeat expansion. These findings strongly suggest that coordinated processing of 3'-slipped (CAG)n/(CTG)n hairpins by polymerases δ and β on during DNA synthesis induces CAG/CTG repeat expansions."

This protein, FKBP12, promotes the RyR1 closed state, thereby inhibiting Ca2+ leakage in resting muscle. Although FKBP12 function is well established, its binding determinants within the RyR1 protein sequence remain unresolved. To identify these sequence determinants using FRET, we created five single-Cys FKBP variants labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (denoted D-FKBP) and then targeted these D-FKBPs to full-length RyR1 constructs containing decahistidine (His10) “tags” placed within N-terminal (amino acid residues 76–619) or central (residues 2157–2777) regions of RyR1. The FRET acceptor Cy3NTA bound specifically and saturably to these His tags, allowing distance analysis of FRET measured from each D-FKBP variant to Cy3NTA bound to each His tag. Results indicate that D-FKBP binds proximal to both N-terminal and central domains of RyR1, thus suggesting that the FKBP binding site is composed of determinants from both regions. These findings further imply that the RyR1 N-terminal and central domains are proximal to one another, a core premise of the domain-switch hypothesis of RyR function. We observed FRET from GFP fused at position 620 within the N-terminal domain to central domain His-tagged sites, thus further supporting this hypothesis. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that N-terminal and central domain elements are closely apposed near the FKBP binding site within the RyR1 three-dimensional structure.Background: The 12-kDa binding protein for the immunosuppressant, FK506 (FKBP), modulates type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) activity via unknown RyR1 sequence determinants.Results: Polyhistidine tags inserted in N-terminal and central RyR1 domains abolish FKBP binding, whereas high fluorescence resonance energy transfer is observed between FKBP and both domains.Conclusion: FKBP binds to determinants within both domains.Significance: Results support domain-switch malignant hyperthermia model.

The FRET acceptor Cy3NTA bound specifically and saturably to these His tags, allowing distance analysis of FRET measured from each D-FKBP variant to Cy3NTA bound to each His tag. Results indicate that D-FKBP binds proximal to both N-terminal and central domains of RyR1, thus suggesting that the FKBP binding site is composed of determinants from both regions. These findings further imply that the RyR1 N-terminal and central domains are proximal to one another, a core premise of the domain-switch hypothesis of RyR function. We observed FRET from GFP fused at position 620 within the N-terminal domain to central domain His-tagged sites, thus further supporting this hypothesis. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that N-terminal and central domain elements are closely apposed near the FKBP binding site within the RyR1 three-dimensional structure. Background: The 12-kDa binding protein for the immunosuppressant, FK506 (FKBP), modulates type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) activity via unknown RyR1 sequence determinants. Results: Polyhistidine tags inserted in N-terminal and central RyR1 domains abolish FKBP binding, whereas high fluorescence resonance energy transfer is observed between FKBP and both domains. Conclusion: FKBP binds to determinants within both domains. Significance: Results support domain-switch malignant hyperthermia model."
https://openalex.org/W2159802476,"All organisms have evolved photodetection systems to synchronize their physiology and behavior with the external light-dark (LD) cycles. In nonmammalian vertebrates, the retina, the pineal organ, and the deep brain can be photoreceptive. Inner retinal photoreceptors transmit photic information to the brain and regulate diverse nonvisual tasks. We previously reported that even after preventing extraretinal photoreception, blind GUCY1* chickens lacking functional visual photoreceptors could perceive light that modulates physiology and behavior. Here we investigated the contribution of different photoreceptive system components (retinal/pineal and deep brain photoreceptors) to the photic entrainment of feeding rhythms. Wild-type (WT) and GUCY1* birds with head occlusion to avoid extraocular light detection synchronized their feeding rhythms to a LD cycle with light >12 lux, whereas at lower intensities blind birds free-ran with a period of >24 h. When released to constant light, both WT and blind chickens became arrhythmic; however, after head occlusion, GUCY1* birds free-ran with a 24.5-h period. In enucleated birds, brain illumination synchronized feeding rhythms, but in pinealectomized birds only responses to high-intensity light (≥800 lux) were observed, revealing functional deep brain photoreceptors. In chickens, a multiple photoreceptive system, including retinal and extraretinal photoreceptors, differentially contributes to the synchronization of circadian feeding behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2038841275,"Survival of patients with lung cancer could be significantly prolonged should the disease be diagnosed early. Growing evidence indicates that the immune response in the form of autoantibodies to developing cancer is present before clinical presentation. We used a phage-displayed antibody library to select for recombinant scFvs that specifically bind to lung cancer-associated IgM autoantibodies. We selected for scFv recombinant antibodies reactive with circulating IgM autoantibodies found in the serum of patients with early stage lung adenocarcinoma but not matched controls. Discriminatory performance of 6 selected scFvs was validated in an independent set of serum from stage 1 adenocarcinoma and matching control groups using two independent novel methods developed for this application. The panel of 6 selected scFvs predicted cancer based on seroreactivity value with sensitivity of 0.8 and specificity of 0.87. Receiver Operative Characteristic curve (ROC) for combined 6 scFv has an AUC of 0.88 (95%CI, 0.76–1.0) as determined by fluorometric microvolume assay technology (FMAT) The ROC curve generated using a homogeneous bridging Mesa Scale Discovery (MSD) assay had an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.59–0.85). The panel of all 6 antibodies demonstrated better discriminative power than any single scFv alone. The scFv panel also demonstrated the association between a high score - based on seroreactivity - with poor survival. Selected scFvs were able to recognize lung cancer associated IgM autoantibodies in patient serum as early as 21 months before the clinical presentation of disease. The panel of antibodies discovered represents a potential unique non-invasive molecular tool to detect an immune response specific to lung adenocarcinoma at an early stage of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2015825816,"The dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH) contributes to the regulation of overall energy homeostasis by modulating energy intake as well as energy expenditure. Despite the importance of the DMH in the control of energy balance, DMH-specific genetic markers or neuronal subtypes are poorly defined. Here we demonstrate the presence of cholinergic neurons in the DMH using genetically modified mice that express enhanced green florescent protein (eGFP) selectively in choline acetyltransferase (Chat)-neurons. Overnight food deprivation increases the activity of DMH cholinergic neurons, as shown by induction of fos protein and a significant shift in the baseline resting membrane potential. DMH cholinergic neurons receive both glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic input, but the activation of these neurons by an overnight fast is due entirely to decreased inhibitory tone. The decreased inhibition is associated with decreased frequency and amplitude of GABAergic synaptic currents in the cholinergic DMH neurons, while glutamatergic synaptic transmission is not altered. As neither the frequency nor amplitude of miniature GABAergic or glutamatergic postsynaptic currents is affected by overnight food deprivation, the fasting-induced decrease in inhibitory tone to cholinergic neurons is dependent on superthreshold activity of GABAergic inputs. This study reveals that cholinergic neurons in the DMH readily sense the availability of nutrients and respond to overnight fasting via decreased GABAergic inhibitory tone. As such, altered synaptic as well as neuronal activity of DMH cholinergic neurons may play a critical role in the regulation of overall energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1999479322,"Over-expression of phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes/phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes (PED/PEA-15) causes insulin resistance by interacting with the D4 domain of phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Indeed, the disruption of this association restores insulin sensitivity in cultured cells over-expressing PED/PEA-15. Whether the displacement of PLD1 from PED/PEA-15 improves insulin sensitivity in vivo has not been explored yet. In this work we show that treatment with a recombinant adenoviral vector containing the human D4 cDNA (Ad-D4) restores normal glucose homeostasis in transgenic mice overexpressing PED/PEA-15 (Tg ped/pea-15) by improving both insulin sensitivity and secretion. In skeletal muscle of these mice, D4 over-expression inhibited PED/PEA-15-PLD1 interaction, decreased Protein Kinase C alpha activation and restored insulin induced Protein Kinase C zeta activation, leading to amelioration of insulin-dependent glucose uptake. Interestingly, Ad-D4 administration improved insulin sensitivity also in high-fat diet treated obese C57Bl/6 mice. We conclude that PED/PEA-15-PLD1 interaction may represent a novel target for interventions aiming at improving glucose tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2035938758,"Purpose The aim of this study is to examine whether or not hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) genetic variations are associated with susceptibility to primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) in the Han Chinese population. Methods Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)–rs5745718, rs17427817, and rs3735520–in the HGF gene were genotyped in 238 adult patients with PACG and 287 age-, sex-, and ethnically matched healthy controls by using a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Data was analyzed by χ2 analysis. Results The three tested analyzed polymorphisms in the HGF gene were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, in all the subjects. The frequencies of the genotype and allele of rs5745718 and rs1742817 in the HGF gene were significantly different between the PACG patients and the controls. On one hand, the frequencies of the CC genotype and C allele of rs5745718 were significantly decreased in PACG patients compared with controls (Pc = 1.40×10−3; Pc = 3.21×10−4, respectively); however, on the other hand, significantly decreased frequencies of the GG genotype and the G allele of rs17427817 were observed in PACG patients compared with the controls (Pc = 0.006,; Pc = 6.06×10−4, respectively). A comparison of the distributions of the genotypes and alleles of rs3735520 showed no statistically significant differences between the PACG patients and the controls (pc>0.05). The haplotype analysis results showed that the CGC haplotype frequency was significantly decreased in the patients with PACG compared with the controls (pc<0.001). No difference was detected between the patients and the controls with regard to the other haplotypes. Conclusions Our study suggests that rs5745718 and rs17427817 are associated with a decreased risk of PACG in the Chinese Han population. The CGC haplotype was demonstrated to possibly play a protective role against PACG in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2093559873,"Natural tropism to the liver is a major obstacle in systemic delivery of adenoviruses in cancer gene therapy. Adenovirus binding to soluble coagulation factors and to cellular heparan sulphate proteoglycans via the fiber shaft KKTK domain are suggested to cause liver tropism. Serotype 5 adenovirus constructs with mutated KKTK regions exhibit liver detargeting, but they also transduce tumors less efficiently, possibly due to altered fiber conformation. We constructed Ad5/3lucS*, a 5/3 chimeric adenovirus with a mutated KKTK region. The fiber knob swap was hypothesized to facilitate tumor transduction. This construct was studied with or without additional coagulation factor ablation. Ad5/3lucS* exhibited significantly reduced transduction of human hepatic cells in vitro and mouse livers in vivo. Combination of coagulation factor ablation by warfarinization to Ad5/3lucS* seemed to further enhance liver detargeting. Cancer cell transduction by Ad5/3lucS* was retained in vitro. In vivo, viral particle accumulation in M4A4-LM3 xenograft tumors was comparable to controls, but Ad5/3lucS* transgene expression was nearly abolished. Coagulation factor ablation did not affect tumor transduction. These studies set the stage for further investigations into the effects of the KKTK mutation and coagulation factor ablation in the context of 5/3 serotype chimerism. Of note, the putative disconnect between tumor transduction and transgene expression could prove useful in further understanding of adenovirus biology."
https://openalex.org/W1968363727,"In this study, we describe a simple and reliable method to study neuroprotective effects in living and organized neural tissue. This method, which was based on retinal explants for in vivo focal lesions, was conceived as a collection of modular procedures, which can be customized for particular demands. With this model, it is possible to combine immunohistochemistry with image data analysis to track the two- or three-dimensional redistribution of proteins as a time/space function of primary cell loss. At the same time, it is possible to finely control the exposure of the tissue to specific drugs and molecules. In order to illustrate the use of the proposed method, we tested the effects of two different nanotube compounds on retinal explant viability. Transcriptome analyses can be separately performed in the lesion focus and penumbra with laser capture microdissection followed by polymerase chain reaction analyses. In addition, other common experimental drawbacks, such as high individual variance, are eliminated. With intraocular injections, treatments can be verified in vivo, with one eye serving as the experimental tissue and the other serving as the control tissue. In summary, we describe a flexible and easy method, which can be useful in combination with a broad variety of recently developed neuroprotective strategies, to study neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2156462584,"Eukaryotic cells maintain strict control over protein secretion, in part by using the pH gradient maintained within their secretory pathway. How eukaryotic proteins evolved from prokaryotic orthologs to exploit the pH gradient for biological functions remains a fundamental question in cell biology. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that protein domains located within precursor proteins, propeptides, encode histidine-driven pH sensors to regulate organelle-specific activation of the eukaryotic proteases furin and proprotein convertase-1/3. Similar findings have been reported in other unrelated protease families. By analyzing >10,000 unique proteases within evolutionarily unrelated families, we show that eukaryotic propeptides are enriched in histidines compared with prokaryotic orthologs. On this basis, we hypothesize that eukaryotic proteins evolved to enrich histidines within their propeptides to exploit the tightly controlled pH gradient of the secretory pathway, thereby regulating activation within specific organelles. Enrichment of histidines in propeptides may therefore be used to predict the presence of pH sensors in other proteases or even protease substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1976016654,"Causal ordering is a useful tool for mobile distributed systems (MDS) to reduce the non-determinism induced by three main aspects: host mobility, asynchronous execution, and unpredictable communication delays. Several causal protocols for MDS exist. Most of them, in order to reduce the overhead and the computational cost over wireless channels and mobile hosts (MH), ensure causal ordering at and according to the causal view of the Base Stations. Nevertheless, these protocols introduce certain disadvantage, such as unnecessary inhibition at the delivery of messages. In this paper, we present an efficient causal protocol for groupware that satisfies the MDS's constraints, avoiding unnecessary inhibitions and ensuring the causal delivery based on the view of the MHs. One interesting aspect of our protocol is that it dynamically adapts the causal information attached to each message based on the number of messages with immediate dependency relation, and this is not directly proportional to the number of MHs."
