https://openalex.org/W2946687847,"Mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) are central microdomains that fine-tune bioenergetics by the local transfer of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we report an unexpected function of the endoplasmic reticulum stress transducer IRE1α as a structural determinant of MAMs that controls mitochondrial calcium uptake. IRE1α deficiency resulted in marked alterations in mitochondrial physiology and energy metabolism under resting conditions. IRE1α determined the distribution of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors at MAMs by operating as a scaffold. Using mutagenesis analysis, we separated the housekeeping activity of IRE1α at MAMs from its canonical role in the unfolded protein response. These observations were validated in vivo in the liver of IRE1α conditional knockout mice, revealing broad implications for cellular metabolism. Our results support an alternative function of IRE1α in orchestrating the communication between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to sustain bioenergetics."
https://openalex.org/W2944873741,"The initiation of bacterial translation involves the tightly regulated joining of the 50S ribosomal subunit to an initiator transfer RNA (fMet-tRNAfMet)-containing 30S ribosomal initiation complex to form a 70S initiation complex, which subsequently matures into a 70S elongation-competent complex. Rapid and accurate formation of the 70S initiation complex is promoted by initiation factors, which must dissociate from the 30S initiation complex before the resulting 70S elongation-competent complex can begin the elongation of translation1. Although comparisons of the structures of the 30S2-5 and 70S4,6-8 initiation complexes have revealed that the ribosome, initiation factors and fMet-tRNAfMet can acquire different conformations in these complexes, the timing of conformational changes during formation of the 70S initiation complex, the structures of any intermediates formed during these rearrangements, and the contributions that these dynamics might make to the mechanism and regulation of initiation remain unknown. Moreover, the absence of a structure of the 70S elongation-competent complex formed via an initiation-factor-catalysed reaction has precluded an understanding of the rearrangements to the ribosome, initiation factors and fMet-tRNAfMet that occur during maturation of a 70S initiation complex into a 70S elongation-competent complex. Here, using time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy9, we report the near-atomic-resolution view of how a time-ordered series of conformational changes drive and regulate subunit joining, initiation factor dissociation and fMet-tRNAfMet positioning during formation of the 70S elongation-competent complex. Our results demonstrate the power of time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy to determine how a time-ordered series of conformational changes contribute to the mechanism and regulation of one of the most fundamental processes in biology."
https://openalex.org/W2945896312,"PINK1 (PARK6) and PARKIN (PARK2) are causal genes of recessive familial Parkinson's disease. Parkin is a ubiquitin ligase E3 that conjugates ubiquitin to impaired mitochondrial proteins for organelle degradation. PINK1, a Ser/Thr kinase that accumulates only on impaired mitochondria, phosphorylates two authentic substrates, the ubiquitin-like domain of Parkin and ubiquitin. Our group and others have revealed that both the subcellular localization and ligase activity of Parkin are regulated through interactions with phosphorylated ubiquitin. Once PINK1 localizes on impaired mitochondria, PINK1-catalyzed phosphoubiquitin recruits and activates Parkin. Parkin then supplies a ubiquitin chain to PINK1 for phosphorylation. The amplified ubiquitin functions as a signal for the sequestration and degradation of the damaged mitochondria. Although a bewildering variety of Parkin substrates have been reported, the basis for Parkin substrate specificity remains poorly understood. Moreover, the mechanism underlying initial activation and translocation of Parkin onto mitochondria remains unclear, because the presence of ubiquitin on impaired mitochondria is thought to be a prerequisite for the initial PINK1 phosphorylation process. Here, we show that artificial mitochondria-targeted proteins are ubiquitylated by Parkin, suggesting that substrate specificity of Parkin is not determined by its amino acid sequence. Moreover, recruitment and activation of Parkin are delayed following depletion of the mitochondrial E3, MITOL/March5. We propose a model in which the initial step in Parkin recruitment and activation requires protein ubiquitylation by MITOL/March5 with subsequent PINK1-mediated phosphorylation. Because PINK1 and Parkin amplify the ubiquitin signal via a positive feedback loop, the low substrate specificity of Parkin might facilitate this amplification process."

https://openalex.org/W2944986190,"Mobile phones are reliable devices for communication and entertainment. However, their utilization for prolonged periods in flexed neck position is linked to neck and shoulders pain. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the association between neck pain and the duration of device use, taking into consideration gender, age, and the most frequent position in which students use their devices.Based on a self-administered online questionnaire, we filled 500 questionnaires between February 15th, 2017 and March 18th, 2017. The study sample included healthy students from health care faculties regardless of their age, gender, or handedness.Analysis of the predictors for pain severity showed that age (p = 0.04) and duration of use (p = 0.001) were significantly associated with the severity of neck pain, while only the duration of use was significantly associated with pain duration (p = 0.036). Subjects were divided into two groups according to the pain score, 75.8% had pain severity equal or less than 4/10 and 24.2% had pain severity more than 4/10. Of those with pain severity >4, 5.8% of students sought medical help at the emergency department and 12.4% visited clinics, compared to only 0.3% seeking medical advice at an emergency department and 4.2% visiting clinics in the group with pain severity of ≤4 (p<0.001). Regarding the use of analgesia in the two groups, 44.6% of subjects with pain severity of >4 used analgesia, compared to only 12.1% in subjects with pain severity of ≤4 (p< 0.001).This study demonstrates a significant positive correlation between the duration of mobile phone use and the duration and severity of neck pain. Furthermore, the increased severity of neck pain places a huge burden on the healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W2945489406,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a monolayer of pigmented cells between the choroid and the retina. RPE dysfunction underlies many retinal degenerative diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of age-related blindness. To perform its various functions in nutrient transport, phagocytosis of the outer segment, and cytokine secretion, the RPE relies on an active energy metabolism. We previously reported that human RPE cells prefer proline as a nutrient and transport proline-derived metabolites to the apical, or retinal, side. In this study, we investigated how RPE utilizes proline in vivo and why proline is a preferred substrate. By using [13C]proline labeling both ex vivo and in vivo, we found that the retina rarely uses proline directly, whereas the RPE utilizes it at a high rate, exporting proline-derived mitochondrial intermediates for use by the retina. We observed that in primary human RPE cell culture, proline is the only amino acid whose uptake increases with cellular maturity. In human RPE, proline was sufficient to stimulate de novo serine synthesis, increase reductive carboxylation, and protect against oxidative damage. Blocking proline catabolism in RPE impaired glucose metabolism and GSH production. Notably, in an acute model of RPE-induced retinal degeneration, dietary proline improved visual function. In conclusion, proline is an important nutrient that supports RPE metabolism and the metabolic demand of the retina.

https://openalex.org/W2944905766,"Early defibrillation by an automated external defibrillator (AED) is key for the survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. ECG feature extraction and machine learning have been successfully used to detect ventricular fibrillation (VF) in AED shock decision algorithms. Recently, deep learning architectures based on 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been proposed for this task. This study introduces a deep learning architecture based on 1D-CNN layers and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for the detection of VF. Two datasets were used, one from public repositories of Holter recordings captured at the onset of the arrhythmia, and a second from OHCA patients obtained minutes after the onset of the arrest. Data was partitioned patient-wise into training (80%) to design the classifiers, and test (20%) to report the results. The proposed architecture was compared to 1D-CNN only deep learners, and to a classical approach based on VF-detection features and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The algorithms were evaluated in terms of balanced accuracy (BAC), the unweighted mean of the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp). The BAC, Se, and Sp of the architecture for 4-s ECG segments was 99.3%, 99.7%, and 98.9% for the public data, and 98.0%, 99.2%, and 96.7% for OHCA data. The proposed architecture outperformed all other classifiers by at least 0.3-points in BAC in the public data, and by 2.2-points in the OHCA data. The architecture met the 95% Sp and 90% Se requirements of the American Heart Association in both datasets for segment lengths as short as 3-s. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the most accurate VF detection algorithm to date, especially on OHCA data, and it would enable an accurate shock no shock diagnosis in a very short time."
https://openalex.org/W2945635306,"N-linked glycosylation in monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is crucial for structural and functional properties of mAb therapeutics, including stability, pharmacokinetics, safety and clinical efficacy. The biopharmaceutical industry currently lacks tools to precisely control N-glycosylation levels during mAb production. In this study, we engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells with synthetic genetic circuits to tune N-glycosylation of a stably expressed IgG. We knocked out two key glycosyltransferase genes, α-1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) and β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GALT1), genomically integrated circuits expressing synthetic glycosyltransferase genes under constitutive or inducible promoters and generated antibodies with concurrently desired fucosylation (0–97%) and galactosylation (0–87%) levels. Simultaneous and independent control of FUT8 and β4GALT1 expression was achieved using orthogonal small molecule inducers. Effector function studies confirmed that glycosylation profile changes affected antibody binding to a cell surface receptor. Precise and rational modification of N-glycosylation will allow new recombinant protein therapeutics with tailored in vitro and in vivo effects for various biotechnological and biomedical applications. Synthetic gene circuits regulated by small molecules have been used to fine-tune glycosyltransferase expression in CHO cells, providing a method to produce therapeutic monoclonal antibodies with precise glycosylation states."
https://openalex.org/W2946412743,"Estimating and selecting risk factors with extremely low prevalences of exposure for a binary outcome is a challenge because classical standard techniques, markedly logistic regression, often fail to provide meaningful results in such settings. While penalized regression methods are widely used in high-dimensional settings, we were able to show their usefulness in low-dimensional settings as well. Specifically, we demonstrate that Firth correction, ridge, the lasso and boosting all improve the estimation for low-prevalence risk factors. While the methods themselves are well-established, comparison studies are needed to assess their potential benefits in this context. This is done here using the dataset of a large unmatched case-control study from France (2005-2008) about the relationship between prescription medicines and road traffic accidents and an accompanying simulation study. Results show that the estimation of risk factors with prevalences below 0.1% can be drastically improved by using Firth correction and boosting in particular, especially for ultra-low prevalences. When a moderate number of low prevalence exposures is available, we recommend the use of penalized techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2946315733,"Spores of several Bacillus species have long history of consumption and safe use as probiotics and a variety of formulations containing these organisms are available in the global market. Considering the difficulties in the identification of Bacillus species and the poor microbiological quality of many probiotic formulations, we used three up-to-date methodological approaches for analyzing the content of ten formulations marketed in Italy and labeled to contain Bacillus spores. We compared the performance of biochemical tests based on the BCL Vitek2 card and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, using 16S rDNA sequencing as the reference technique. The BCL card performed well in identifying all Bacillus probiotic strains as well as the Bruker’s MALDI Biotyper. Nevertheless, the MALDI score values were sometimes lower than those indicated by the manufacturer for correct species identification. Contaminant bacteria (Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus cereus, Brevibacillus choshinensis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus badius) were detected in some formulations. Characterization of the B. cereus contaminant showed the potential pathogenicity of this strain. Microbial enumeration performed by the plate count method revealed that the number of viable cells contained in many of the analyzed products differed from the labeled amount. Overall, our data show that only two of the ten analyzed formulations qualitatively and quantitatively respect what is on the label. Since probiotic properties are most often strain specific, molecular typing of isolates of the two most common Bacillus species, B. clausii and B. coagulans, was also performed. In conclusion, the majority of the analyzed products do not comply with quality requirements, most likely leading to reduced/absent efficacy of the preparation and representing a potential infective risk for consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2945816963,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute self-limited systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology affecting mainly children less than 5 years of age. Risk factors for cardiac involvement and resistance to treatment are insufficiently studied in non-Japanese children.This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, clinical features and risk factors for resistance to treatment and coronary artery lesions (CAL) in KD in Spain.Retrospective study (May 2011-June 2016) of all patients less than 16 years of age diagnosed with KD included in KAWA-RACE network (84 Spanish hospitals).A total of 625 cases were analyzed, 63% were males, 79% under 5 year-olds and 16.8% younger than 12 months. On echocardiographic examination CAL were the most frequent findings (23%) being ectasia the most common (12%). Coronary aneurysms were diagnosed in 9.6%, reaching 20% in infants under 12 months (p<0.001). A total of 97% of the patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with a median number of days from fever onset to IVIG administration of 7.2. A second dose was given to 15.7% and steroids to 14.5% patients. Only 1.4% patients received infliximab. No deaths were reported. A multivariate analysis identified anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, higher creatinine and procalcitonin as independent risk factors for treatment failure and length under 103 cm, hemoglobin < 10.2 mg/dL, platelets > 900,000 cells/mm3, maximum temperature < 39.5°C, total duration of fever > 10 days and fever before treatment ≥ 8 days as independent risk factors for developing coronary aneurysms.In our population, children under 12 months develop coronary aneurysms more frequently and children with KD with anemia and leukocytosis have high risk of cardiac involvement. Adding steroids early should be considered in those patients, especially if the treatment is not started before 8 days of fever. A score applicable to non-Japanese children able to predict the risk of aneurysm development and IVIG resistance is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2946028463,"Wnt signalling drives many processes in development, homeostasis and disease; however, the role and mechanism of individual ligand–receptor (Wnt–Frizzled (Fzd)) interactions in specific biological processes remain poorly understood. Wnt9a is specifically required for the amplification of blood progenitor cells during development. Using genetic studies in zebrafish and human embryonic stem cells, paired with in vitro cell biology and biochemistry, we determined that Wnt9a signals specifically through Fzd9b to elicit β-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling that regulates haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell emergence. We demonstrate that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is required as a cofactor for Wnt9a–Fzd9b signalling. EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of one tyrosine residue on the Fzd9b intracellular tail in response to Wnt9a promotes internalization of the Wnt9a–Fzd9b–LRP signalosome and subsequent signal transduction. These findings provide mechanistic insights for specific Wnt–Fzd signals, which will be crucial for specific therapeutic targeting and regenerative medicine. Grainger et al. demonstrate that, in zebrafish and human cells, EGFR-mediated phosphorylation of Fzd9b promotes internalization of the Wnt9a–Fzd9b–LRP signalosome and subsequent signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2946594661,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have shown promise as a therapy for immune-mediated disorders, including transplant rejection. Our group previously demonstrated the efficacy of pretransplant, systemic administration of allogeneic but not syngeneic MSCs in a rat cornea transplant model. The aim of this study was to enhance the immunomodulatory capacity of syngeneic MSCs. In vitro, MSCs licensed with TNF-α/IL-1β (MSCsTNF-α/IL-1β) suppress syngeneic lymphocyte proliferation via NO production. In vivo, when administered post-transplantation, nonlicensed syngeneic MSCs improved graft survival from 0 to 50% and MSCsTNF-α/IL-1β, in an NO-dependent manner, improved survival to 70%. Improved survival was associated with increased CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression in the draining lymph node. MSCsTNF-α/IL-1β demonstrated a more potent immunomodulatory capacity compared with nonlicensed MSCs, promoting an immune-regulatory CD11b+B220+ monocyte/macrophage population and significantly expanding Treg cells in the lungs and spleen. Ex vivo, we observed that lung-derived myeloid cells act as intermediaries of MSC immunomodulatory function. MSC-conditioned myeloid cells suppressed stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and promoted expansion of Treg cells from naive lymphocytes. This work illustrates how syngeneic MSC therapy can be enhanced by licensing and optimization of timing strategies and further highlights the important role of myeloid cells in mediating MSC immunomodulatory capacity.-Murphy, N., Treacy, O., Lynch, K., Morcos, M., Lohan, P., Howard, L., Fahy, G., Griffin, M.

https://openalex.org/W2945112858,"Baloxavir marboxil (BXM) is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN), an essential enzyme in the initiation of mRNA synthesis of influenza viruses. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of BXM against influenza virus infection in mouse models. Single-day oral administration of BXM completely prevented mortality due to infection with influenza A and B virus in mice. Moreover, 5-day repeated administration of BXM was more effective for reducing mortality and body weight loss in mice infected with influenza A virus than oseltamivir phosphate (OSP), even when the treatment was delayed up to 96 hours post infection (p.i.). Notably, administration of BXM, starting at 72 hours p.i. led to significant decrease in virus titers of >2-log10 reduction compared to the vehicle control within 24 hours after administration. Virus reduction in the lung was significantly greater than that observed with OSP. In addition, profound and sustained reduction of virus titer was observed in the immunocompromised mouse model without emergence of variants possessing treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in the target protein. In our immunocompetent and immunocompromised mouse models, delayed treatment with BXM resulted in rapid and potent reduction in infectious virus titer and prevention of signs of influenza infection, suggesting that BXM could extend the therapeutic window for patients with influenza virus infection regardless of the host immune status."

https://openalex.org/W2945887647,"Background Anesthesia may induce neurotoxicity and neurocognitive impairment in young mice. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely to be determined. Meanwhile, autophagy is involved in brain development and contributes to neurodegenerative diseases. We, therefore, set out to determine the effects of sevoflurane on autophagy in the hippocampus of young mice and on cognitive function in the mice. Methods Six day-old mice received 3% sevoflurane, for two hours daily, on postnatal days (P) 6, 7 and 8. We then decapitated the mice and harvested the hippocampus of the young mice at P8. The level of LC3, the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, and SQSTM1/p62 level associated with the autophagy in the hippocampus of the mice were assessed by using Western blotting. We used different groups of mice for behavioral testing via the Morris Water Maze from P31 to P37. Results The anesthetic sevoflurane increased the level of LC3-II and ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, decreased the p62 level in the hippocampus of the young mice, and induced cognitive impairment in the mice. 3-Methyladenine, the inhibitor of autophagy, attenuated the activation of autophagy and ameliorated the cognitive impairment induced by sevoflurane in the young mice. Conclusion These data showed that sevoflurane anesthesia might induce cognitive impairment in the young mice via activation of autophagy in the hippocampus of the young mice. These findings from the proof of concept studies have established a system and suggest the role of autophagy in anesthesia neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment in the young mice, pending further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2945672792,"Oregano essential oil (OEO), which has antimicrobial properties, may be used for altering the ruminal pH and microbial populations of sheep, as observed by the altered volatile fatty acid patterns. To further elucidate the effects of OEO on ruminal pH and microbial populations of sheep, 3 German merino sheep × local sheep crossbred rams with permanent ruminal fistulas were randomly assigned to a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 12-d periods. The treatments were as follows: control (CON); OEO4: OEO supplied at 4 g•d-1; and OEO7: OEO supplied at 7 g•d-1. Starting on day 11, rumen fluid was collected at 0 h, and at 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h after supplying OEO, and then pH values of rumen fluid were immediately measured. The abundance of microbial populations was determined by using qPCR. The ruminal pH values were similar among the sheep from all treatments. The abundance of ruminal fungi was higher for the sheep supplied OEO7 compared with the sheep supplied CON and OEO4, especially at 4 and 12 h. The abundance of ruminal protozoa decreased with supplied OEO, indicating that OEO could inhibit the protozoa. The abundance of the total ruminal bacteria was similar for the sheep from all treatments, but R. flavefaciens, R. albus and F. succinogenes increased in the sheep supplied OEO4 compared with those in the sheep supplied CON, however, the sheep supplied OEO7 had higher abundances of R. flavefaciens than the sheep supplied CON. These results demonstrated that supplying OEO to sheep did not affect the ruminal pH but could shift the rumen microbial population to one with less protozoa. Supplying OEO can preferentially enhance the growth of certain rumen microbial populations, but the shifts were influenced by the supply rate. Therefore, supplying low amount (i.e. 4 g•d-1) of OEO could have positive effects on ruminal microbial populations, whereas supplying elevated doses of OEO could be detrimental to those same ruminal microbial populations."
https://openalex.org/W2944971228,"Purpose To determine the impact of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) organ sub-scores for hospital mortality risk stratification in a contemporary cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) population. Materials and methods Adult CICU admissions between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2015 were reviewed. The SOFA score and organ sub-scores were calculated on CICU day 1; patients with missing SOFA sub-score data were excluded. Discrimination for hospital mortality was assessed using area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) values, followed by multivariable logistic regression. Results We included 1214 patients with complete SOFA sub-score data. The mean age was 67 ± 16 years (38% female); all-cause hospital mortality was 26%. Day 1 SOFA score predicted hospital mortality with an AUROC of 0.72. Each SOFA organ sub-score predicted hospital mortality (all p <0.01), with AUROC values of 0.53 to 0.67. On multivariable analysis, only the cardiovascular, central nervous system, renal and respiratory SOFA sub-scores were associated with hospital mortality (all p <0.01). A simplified SOFA score containing the cardiovascular, central nervous system and renal sub-scores had an AUROC of 0.72. Conclusions In CICU patients with complete SOFA sub-score data, risk stratification for hospital mortality is determined primarily by the cardiovascular, central nervous system, renal and respiratory SOFA sub-scores."

https://openalex.org/W2946078312,"This study examines two contrasting explanations for early tendencies to fight and flee. According to a stimulus-driven explanation, goal-incompatible stimuli that are easy/difficult to control lead to the tendency to fight/flee. According to a goal-directed explanation, on the other hand, the tendency to fight/flee occurs when the expected utility of fighting/fleeing is the highest. Participants did a computer task in which they were confronted with goal-incompatible stimuli that were (a) easy to control and fighting had the highest expected utility, (b) easy to control and fleeing had the highest expected utility, and (c) difficult to control and fleeing and fighting had zero expected utility. After participants were trained to use one hand to fight and another hand to flee, they either had to choose a response or merely observe the stimuli. During the observation trials, single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was applied to the primary motor cortex 450 ms post-stimulus onset and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured from the hand muscles. Results showed that participants chose to fight/flee when the expected utility of fighting/fleeing was the highest, and that they responded late when the expected utility of both responses was low. They also showed larger MEPs for the right/left hand when the expected utility of fighting/fleeing was the highest. This result can be interpreted as support for the goal-directed account, but only if it is assumed that we were unable to override the presumed natural mapping between hand (right/left) and response (fight/flight)."

The sample consisted of 61 students (32 in the experimental group and 29 in the control group), aged 12 to 14 years. Two physical education teachers were part of the group, one who was trained to give autonomy-support classes and the other used the usual class model. The experimental group teacher gave classes based on the autonomy support style, while his control group counterpart did not follow any model. The students, assessed before and after the 8-month intervention, were measured for perception of interpersonal teaching style, basic psychological needs, self-determined motivation and satisfaction from engaging in physical activity. The results showed that the experimental group exhibited higher indices for autonomy, competence and relatedness, self-determined motivation and satisfaction from engaging in physical activity, when compared to the control group. The study provides evidence of the effectiveness of programs that support autonomy in physical education classes, emphasizing the importance of pedagogical strategies and educational programs that promote the development of basic psychological needs, self-determined motivation and its positive consequences in relation to physical education classes."
https://openalex.org/W2946395116,"Recent data support that the vaginal microbiota may alter mucosal pharmacokinetics (PK) of topically delivered microbicides. Our team developed an intravaginal ring (IVR) that delivers tenofovir (TFV) (8–10 mg/day) alone or with levonorgestrel (LNG) (20 ug/day). We evaluated the effect of IVRs on the vaginal microbiota, and describe how the vaginal microbiota impacts mucosal PK of TFV. CONRAD A13-128 was a randomized, placebo controlled phase I study. We randomized 51 women to TFV, TFV/LNG or placebo IVR. We assessed the vaginal microbiota by sequencing the V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes prior to IVR insertion and after approximately 15 days of use. We measured the concentration of TFV in the cervicovaginal (CV) aspirate, and TFV and TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) in vaginal tissue at the end of IVR use. The change in relative or absolute abundance of vaginal bacterial phylotypes was similar among active and placebo IVR users (all q values >0.13). TFV concentrations in CV aspirate and vaginal tissue, and TFV-DP concentrations in vaginal tissue were not significantly different among users with community state type (CST) 4 versus those with Lactobacillus dominated microbiota (all p values >0.07). The proportions of participants with CV aspirate concentrations of TFV >200,000 ng/mL and those with tissue TFV-DP concentrations >1,000 fmol/mg were similar among women with anaerobe versus Lactobacillus dominated microbiota (p = 0.43, 0.95 respectively). There were no significant correlations between the CV aspirate concentration of TFV and the relative abundances of Gardnerella vaginalis or Prevotella species. Tissue concentrations of TFV-DP did not correlate with any the relative abundances of any species, including Gardnerella vaginalis. In conclusion, active IVRs did not differ from the placebo IVR on the effect on the vaginal microbiota. Local TFV and TFV-DP concentrations were high and similar among IVR users with Lactobacillus dominated microbiota versus CST IV vaginal microbiota.

https://openalex.org/W2946829526,"Chronic pain affects 50% of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Although central sensitization is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of this chronic pain, no studies have examined differences in functional connectivity of the brain between patients with SCD with and without chronic pain. We performed an observational cohort study using resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) of the brain on adults with SCD with and without chronic pain. We tested the hypothesis that, compared to those without chronic pain, those with chronic pain would have differences in functional connectivity between the periaqueductal grey (PAG) and other regions of the brain. Twenty-two adults with SCD, 15 with chronic pain and 7 without chronic pain, as well as 10 African-American controls, underwent rsfMRI of the brain. When SCD patients with chronic pain were compared to those without chronic pain, significant differences in connectivity were noted between the PAG and 9 regions of the brain, including several in the default mode network, a network involved in introspection that has been implicated in other chronic pain syndromes. Changes in functional connectivity between patients with SCD with and without chronic pain suggest a mechanism for chronic pain that involves neuro-plastic changes to the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2946173560,"Hybridization is common in many ferns and has been a significant factor in fern evolution and speciation. However, hybrids are rare between the approximately 30 species of Dicksonia tree ferns world-wide, and none are well documented. In this study we examine the relationship of a newly-discovered Dicksonia tree fern from Whirinaki, New Zealand, which does not fit the current taxonomy of the three species currently recognized in New Zealand. Our microsatellite genotyping and ddRAD-seq data indicate these plants are F1 hybrids that have formed multiple times between D. fibrosa and D. lanata subsp. lanata. The Whirinaki plants have intermediate morphology between D. fibrosa and D. lanata subsp. lanata and their malformed spores are consistent with a hybrid origin. The Whirinaki plants-Dicksonia fibrosa × D. lanata subsp. lanata-are an example of hybridization between distantly related fern lineages, with the two parent species estimated to have diverged 55-25 mya. Our chloroplast sequencing indicates asymmetric chloroplast inheritance in the Whirinaki morphology with D. lanata subsp. lanata always contributing the chloroplast genome."
https://openalex.org/W2946348803,"Phytoplankton are the oceans’ principal source of polyunsaturated fatty acids that support the growth and reproduction of consumers such as copepods. Previous studies have demonstrated ocean acidification (OA) can change the availability of polyunsaturated fatty acids to consumer diets which may affect consumer reproduction. Two laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the effects of feeding high-pCO2-reared phytoplankton on copepod egg production, hatching success, and naupliar survival. Marine phytoplankton Rhodomonas salina, Skeletonema marinoi, Prorocentrum micans, and Isochrysis galbana were exponentially grown in semi-continuous cultures at present (control) (400 ppm CO2, pH~8.1) and future (1,000 ppm CO2, pH~7.8) conditions and provided to Acartia tonsa copepods over 4 consecutive days as either nitrogen-limited (Exp. I) or nitrogen-depleted (Exp. II) mixed assemblage of phytoplankton. The composition of FAs in the phytoplankton diet was affected by pCO2 concentration and nitrogen deficiency; the ratio of essential fatty acids to total polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased in phytoplankton grown under high pCO2 and the mass of total fatty acids increased under nitrogen depletion. Additionally, total concentrations of essential fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet mixtures were less under the high-pCO2 compared to the control-pCO2 treatments. Median egg production, hatching success, and naupliar survival were 48–52%, 4–87%, and 9–100% lower, respectively, in females fed high-pCO2 than females fed low-pCO2 phytoplankton, but this decrease in reproductive success was less severe when fed N-depleted, but fatty acid-rich cells. This study demonstrates that the effects of OA on the nutritional quality of phytoplankton (i.e., their cellular fatty acid composition and quota) were modified by the level of nitrogen deficiency and the resulting negative reproductive response of marine primary consumers."
https://openalex.org/W2944861436,"Nerve palsy following total hip arthroplasty (THA) can have a serious effect on a patient`s functional prognosis and on cost-effectiveness, and it is the leading cause of THA-associated medical litigation. However, only a few studies focus on femoral nerve palsy (FNP) following THA with the direct anterior approach (DAA). Moreover, several studies have reported that THA with DAA may result in higher complication rates, particularly during the so-called ‘learning-curve period’ for the surgeon. This study aimed to identify the incidence of FNP following primary THA with DAA, to determine presumed etiologies through a retrospective investigation of FNP clinical courses following primary THA with DAA and to identify any relationship between the occurrence of FNP following primary THA with DAA and the surgeon’s experience of DAA. Since August 2007, DAA for primary THA was introduced in our institution. All 273 consecutive primary THAs with DAA (42 bilateral and 189 unilateral cases) between August 2007 and February 2014 were included in this study. All patients’ charts and radiographs were reviewed to identify cases with palsy and to retrieve related factors. In this study, FNP was defined as weakness of the quadriceps femoris (manual muscle test <3) with or without sensory disturbance over the anteromedial aspect of the thigh. The incidence of FNP following primary THA with DAA was 1.1% (3/273 joints). In all 3 cases, the motor deficit recovered completely within a year. Suspected causes of the palsy in the 3 cases were believed to be improper positioning of the anterior acetabular retractor, excessive leg lengthening, or unknown etiology. There was no significant relationship between palsy and surgeon’s experience of DAA. In THA with DAA for patients requiring major leg lengthening, the likelihood of FNP must be considered. To prevent FNP, the anterior acetabular retractor must be placed properly."
https://openalex.org/W2945166654,"The collagenase subfamily of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have important roles in the remodeling of collagenous matrices. The proteinase-activated receptor (PAR) family has a unique mechanism of activation requiring proteolysis of an extracellular domain forming a neo-N terminus that acts as a tethered ligand, a process that has been associated with the development of arthritis. Canonical PAR2 activation typically occurs via a serine proteinase at Arg36-Ser37, but other proteinases can cleave PARs downstream of the tethered ligand and “disarm” the receptor. To identify additional cleavage sites within PAR2, we synthesized a 42-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the extracellular region. We observed that all three soluble MMP collagenases, MMP-1, MMP-8, and MMP-13, cleave PAR2 and discovered a novel cleavage site (Ser37-Leu38). Metalloproteinases from resorbing bovine nasal cartilage and recombinant human collagenases could cleave a quenched fluorescent peptide mimicking the canonical PAR2 activation region, and kinetic constants were determined. In PAR2-overexpressing SW1353 chondrocytes, we demonstrated that the activator peptide SLIGKV-NH2 induces rapid calcium flux, inflammatory gene expression (including MMP1 and MMP13), and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 kinase. The corresponding MMP cleavage-derived peptide (LIGKVD-NH2) exhibited no canonical activation; however, we observed phosphorylation of ERK, providing evidence of biased agonism. Importantly, we demonstrated that preincubation with active MMP-1 reduced downstream PAR2 activation by a canonical activator, matriptase, but not SLIGKV-NH2.

https://openalex.org/W2945583447,"The reproductive ground plan hypothesis proposes that gene networks regulating foraging behavior and reproductive female physiology in social insects emerged from ancestral gene and endocrine factor networks. Expression of storage proteins such as vitellogenins and hexamerins is an example of this co-option. Hexamerins, through their role modulating juvenile hormone availability, are involved in caste determination in termites. The genome of the fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) encodes four hexamerin genes, hexamerin-like (LOC105192919, hereafter called hexamerin 1), hexamerin (LOC105204474, hereafter called hexamerin 2), arylphorin subunit alpha-like, and arylphorin subunit beta. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis of the S. invicta hexamerins determined that each predicted protein clustered with one of the orthologous Apis mellifera hexamerins. Gene expression analyses by RT-qPCR revealed differential expression of the hexamerins between queens and workers, and between specific task-allocated workers (nurses and foragers). Queens and nurses had significantly higher expression of all genes when compared to foragers. Hexamerin 1 was expressed at higher levels in queens, while hexamerin 2 and arylphorin subunit beta were expressed at significantly higher levels in nurses. Arylphorin subunit alpha-like showed no significant difference in expression between virgin queens and nurses. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between the expression of hexamerin genes and S-hydroprene, a juvenile hormone analog. Significant changes in hexamerin expression were recorded in nurses, virgin queens, and foragers 12 h after application of the analog. Hexamerin 1 and arylphorin subunit alpha-like expression were significantly lower after analog application in virgin queens. In foragers, hexamerin 2 and arylphorin subunit beta were significantly lower after analog application, while in nurses expression of all genes were significantly lower after analog application. Our results suggest that in S. invicta hexamerin genes could be associated with reproductive division of labor and task-allocation of workers."
https://openalex.org/W2945967808,"Astaxanthin is a highly potent antioxidant which can be extracted from Haematococcus pluvialis when cultivated and induced at high stress conditions. Due to astaxanthin’s hydrophobicity, methoxypolyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone (mPEG-PCL) copolymer was synthesized to form polymeric micelles for the encapsulation of astaxanthin. Astaxanthin-loaded polymeric micelles were then used to examine the effects on the proliferation and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) confirmed astaxanthin was encapsulated into mPEG-PCL micelles. Astaxanthin loading and encapsulation efficiency, determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy, were 3.27% and 96.67%, respectively. After 48 h, a total of 87.31% of astaxanthin was released from the polymeric micelles. The drug release profile was better fit by the Michaelis-Menten type model than the power law model. The MSC culture results showed that culture medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/mL astaxanthin-encapsulated polymeric micelles led to a 26.3% increase in MSC proliferation over an 8-day culture period. MSC differentiation results showed that 20 ng/mL astaxanthin-encapsulated polymeric micelles enhanced adipogenesis, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis of MSCs by 52%, 106%, and 182%, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2945329763,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of cancer in women and has a high rate of relapse and death. Notch signaling is crucial for normal breast development and homeostasis. Dysregulation of Notch receptors and ligands has been detected in different BC subtypes and shown to be implicated in tumor development, progression, drug resistance, and recurrence. However, the effects of Notch ligands in various types of BC remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of the Notch ligand DLL1 in three different human BC cell lines: MCF-7, BT474, and MDA-MB-231. We showed that DLL1 expression is higher in MCF-7 and BT474 than in MDA-MB-231 cells, and that these cells respond differently to DLL1 downregulation. Functional assays in MCF-7 cells demonstrated that siRNA-mediated DLL1 downregulation reduced colony formation efficiency, migration, proliferation, caused cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, and induced apoptosis. Gene expression studies revealed that these effects in MCF-7 cells were associated with increased expression of the cell cycle arrest p21 gene and decreased expression of genes that promote cell cycle progression (CDK2, SKP2), and survival (BCL2, BIRC5), unravelling possible mechanisms whereby DLL1 downregulation exerts some of its effects. Moreover, our results demonstrate that treatment with recombinant DLL1 increased MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration, confirming that DLL1 contributes to these processes in this BC cell line. DLL1 downregulation reduced the colony formation efficiency of BT474 cells and decreased the migration and invasion abilities of MDA-MB-231 cells but showed no effects in the proliferation and survival of these cells. Conclusions These findings provide further evidence that DLL1 exerts carcinogenic effects in BC cells. The dissimilar effects of DLL1 downregulation observed amongst MCF-7, BT474, and MDA-MB-231 cells is likely due to their distinctive genetic and biologic characteristics, suggesting that DLL1 contributes to BC through various mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2945939503,"In addition to large plexiform neurofibromas (pNF), NF1 patients are frequently disfigured by cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) and are often afflicted with chronic pain and itch even from seemingly normal skin areas. Both pNFs and cNF consist primarily of benign hyperproliferating nonmyelinating Schwann cells (nSC). While pNF clearly arise within deep nerves and plexuses, the role of cutaneous innervation in the origin of cNF and in chronic itch and pain is unknown. First, we conducted a comprehensive, multi-molecular, immunofluorescence (IF) analyses on 3mm punch biopsies from three separate locations in normal appearing, cNF-free skin in 19 NF1 patients and skin of 16 normal subjects. At least one biopsy in 17 NF1 patients had previously undescribed micro-lesions consisting of a small, dense cluster of nonpeptidergic C-fiber endings and the affiliated nSC consistently adjoining adnexal structures—dermal papillae, hair follicles, sweat glands, sweat ducts, and arterioles—where C-fiber endings normally terminate. Similar micro-lesions were detected in hind paw skin of mice with conditionally-induced SC Nf1-/- mutations. Hypothesizing that these microlesions were pre-cNF origins of cNF, we subsequently analyzed numerous overt, small cNF (s-cNF, 3–6 mm) and discovered that each had an adnexal structure at the epicenter of vastly increased nonpeptidergic C-fiber terminals, accompanied by excessive nSC. The IF and functional genomics assays indicated that neurturin (NTRN) and artemin (ARTN) signaling through cRET kinase and GFRα2 and GFRα3 co-receptors on the aberrant C-fiber endings and nSC may mutually promote the onset of pre-cNF and their evolution to s-cNF. Moreover, TrpA1 and TrpV1 receptors may, respectively, mediate symptoms of chronic itch and pain. These newly discovered molecular characteristics might be targeted to suppress the development of cNF and to treat chronic itch and pain symptoms in NF1 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2949111502,"Background Children with oropharyngeal dysphagia have impaired airway protection mechanisms and are at higher risk for pneumonia and other pulmonary complications. Aspiration of gastric contents is often implicated as a cause for these pulmonary complications, despite being supported by little evidence. The goal of this study is to determine the relative contribution of oropharyngeal and gastric microbial communities to perturbations in the lung microbiome of children with and without oropharyngeal dysphagia and aspiration. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of 220 patients consecutively recruited from a tertiary aerodigestive center undergoing simultaneous esophagogastroduodenoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage, gastric and oropharyngeal samples were collected from all recruited patients and 16S sequencing was performed. A subset of 104 patients also underwent video fluoroscopic swallow studies to assess swallow function and were categorized as aspiration/no aspiration. To ensure the validity of the results, we compared the microbiome of these aerodigestive patients to the microbiome of pediatric patients recruited to a longitudinal cohort study of children with suspected GERD; patients recruited to this study had oropharyngeal, gastric and/or stool samples available. The relationships between microbial communities across the aerodigestive tract were described by analyzing within- and between-patient beta diversities and identifying taxa which are exchanged between aerodigestive sites within patients. These relationships were then compared in patients with and without aspiration to evaluate the effect of aspiration on the aerodigestive microbiome. Results Within all patients, lung, oropharyngeal and gastric microbiomes overlap. The degree of similarity is the lowest between the oropharynx and lungs (median Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) = 0.90), and as high between the stomach and lungs as between the oropharynx and stomach (median JSD = 0.56 for both; p = 0.6). Unlike the oropharyngeal microbiome, lung and gastric communities are highly variable across people and driven primarily by person rather than body site. In patients with aspiration, the lung microbiome more closely resembles oropharyngeal rather than gastric communities and there is greater prevalence of microbial exchange between the lung and oropharynx than between gastric and lung sites (p = 0.04 and 4x10−5, respectively). Conclusions The gastric and lung microbiomes display significant overlap in patients with intact airway protective mechanisms while the lung and oropharynx remain distinct. In patients with impaired swallow function and aspiration, the lung microbiome shifts towards oropharyngeal rather than gastric communities. This finding may explain why antireflux surgeries fail to show benefit in pediatric pulmonary outcomes."

Both tubulins are encoded by multiple genes or composed of different isotypes, which are differentially expressed in different tissues and in development. Tubulin αβ dimers are found throughout the eukaryotes and, although very similar, are known to differ among organisms. We seek to investigate tubulins from different tissues and different organisms for a basic physical characteristic: heterodimer stability and monomer exchange between heterodimers. We previously showed that mammalian brain tubulin heterodimers reversibly dissociate, following the mass action law. Dissociation yields native monomers that can exchange with added tubulin to form new heterodimers. Here, we compared the dissociation of tubulins from multiple sources, including mammalian (rat) brain, cultured human cells (HeLa cells), chicken brain, chicken erythrocytes, and the protozoan Leishmania. We used fluorescence-detected analytical ultracentrifugation to measure tubulin dissociation over a >1000-fold range in concentration and found that tubulin heterodimers from different biological sources differ in Kd by as much as 150-fold under the same conditions. Furthermore, when fluorescent tracer tubulins from various sources were titrated with unlabeled tubulin from a single source (rat brain tubulin), heterologous dimerization occurred, exhibiting similar affinities, in some cases binding even more strongly than with autologous tubulin. These results provide additional insight into the regulation of heterodimer formation of tubulin from different biological sources, revealing that monomer exchange appears to contribute to the sorting of α- and β-tubulin monomers that associate following tubulin folding.

One of the most problematic issues of urbanization is how to properly dispose of used tires, considering the worldwide annual production of approximately 1.4 billion units every year. Despite the efforts to properly dispose of used tires, they still represent a major problem for public health, notably serving as potential breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. Miami-Dade County, Florida has been suffering from arbovirus outbreaks for decades, including dengue, West Nile and yellow fever viruses. The objective of this study was to survey tire shops inserted in the urban matrix across Miami-Dade County for the presence of vector mosquitoes. This study used a cross-sectional design to survey the production of vector mosquitoes at 12 tires shops. Mosquitoes were found in all but one of the tires shops surveyed. We collected a total of 1,110 mosquitoes comprising 528 adults and 582 immatures. Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus were abundantly found in both their immature and adult forms, constituting 99.99% of the mosquito samples collected. Aedes aegypti was the most abundant species recorded displaying the highest values in the Shannon and Simpson indices. The findings of this study demonstrate that vector mosquitoes, primarily Ae. aegypti, are being produced in tires shops in Miami indicating these habitats are highly favorable breeding environments for the production of vector mosquitoes and emphasizing the need to address how the abundance and presence of mosquitoes may vary seasonally in these environments."
https://openalex.org/W2945033685,"Carvedilol is reported to prevent cancers in humans and animal models. However, a molecular mechanism has yet to be established, and the extent to which other β-blockers are chemopreventive remains relatively unknown. A comparative pharmacological approach was utilized with the expectation that a mechanism of action could be devised. JB6 Cl 41-5a (JB6 P+) murine epidermal cells were used to elucidate the chemopreventative properties of β-blockers, as JB6 P+ cells recapitulate in vivo tumor promotion and chemoprevention. The initial hypothesis was that β-blockers that are GRK/β-arrestin biased agonists, like carvedilol, are chemopreventive. Sixteen β-blockers of different classes, isoproterenol, and HEAT HCl were individually co-administered with epidermal growth factor (EGF) to JB6 P+ cells to examine the chemopreventative properties of each ligand. Cytotoxicity was examined to ensure that the anti-transformation effects of each ligand were not due to cellular growth inhibition. Many of the examined β-blockers suppressed EGF-induced JB6 P+ cell transformation in a non-cytotoxic and concentration-dependent manner. However, the IC50 values are high for the most potent inhibitors (243, 326, and 431 nM for carvedilol, labetalol, and alprenolol, respectively) and there is no correlation between pharmacological properties and inhibition of transformation. Therefore, the role of α1- and β2-adrenergic receptors (AR) was examined by standard competition assays and shRNA targeting β2-ARs, the only β-AR expressed in JB6 P+ cells. The results reveal that pharmacological inhibition of α1- and β2-ARs and genetic knockdown of β2-ARs did not abrogate carvedilol-mediated inhibition of EGF-induced JB6 P+ cell transformation. Furthermore, topical administration of carvedilol protected mice from UV-induced skin damage, while genetic ablation of β2-ARs increased carvedilol-mediated effects. Therefore, the prevailing hypothesis that the chemopreventive property of carvedilol is mediated through β-ARs is not supported by this data."

They include the Armitage Doll multi-stage cancer model as a particular case, and have potential to provide new insights into how failures and disease, arise and progress. A method described by E.T. Jaynes is developed to provide an analytical solution for a large class of these models, and highlights connections between the convolution of Laplace transforms, sums of random variables, and Schwinger/Feynman parameterisations. Examples include: exact solutions to the Armitage-Doll model, the sum of Gamma-distributed variables with integer-valued shape parameters, a clonal-growth cancer model, and a model for cascading disasters. Applications and limitations of the approach are discussed in the context of recent cancer research. The model is sufficiently general to be used in many contexts, such as engineering, project management, disease progression, and disaster risk for example, allowing the estimation of failure rates in complex systems and projects. The intended result is a mathematical toolkit for applying multi-stage models to the study of failure rates in complex systems and to the onset of disease, cancer in particular."

Women were classified into three groups: weight gain within IOM recommendations (≥5-≤9kg), low weight gain (≥0-<5kg), and weight loss (<0kg). Maternal complications and birth weight were reported in all groups. The group presenting weight gain within IOM recommendations was considered as the reference group.424 women (42.5%) constituted the reference group and presented weight gain within IOM recommendations; whereas 370 (37.1%) presented low weight gain and 202 (20.3%) presented weight loss. The rate of birthweight above 4000 g was reduced in women with low weight gain (odds ratio (OR) = 0.62 [0.42-0.93]; p = 0.02) and in women with weight loss (OR = 0.58 [0.35-0.96]; p = 0.02). However, the rates of small for gestational age fetuses (SGA) < 10th percentile was increased in women with weight loss (OR = 1.63 [1.03-2.58]; p = 0.02). Maternal and neonatal complications were not significantly different between groups.While low weight gain in women with class II obesity may reduce macrosomia without excessive risk of SGA, it has no effect on maternal and neonatal complication rates."

In spite of their conspicuous appearance, their nature and origin is still debated. The possible inhibitory effects of high surface and sub-surface soil temperatures on grass germination and seedling development on fairy circles have not yet been investigated. We measured maximum, mean daily (24 hour) and mean daytime (sunrise to sunset) temperatures of fairy circles and matrices in the NamibRand Nature Reserve (southwest Namibia). Optimum germination and growing temperatures, and thermal maxima of Stipagrostis ciliata, a grass commonly associated with fairy circle grasslands, were determined experimentally in growth trials. Seeds and seedlings were exposed to temperatures of 35 °C, 37 °C, 41 °C, 44 °C and 47 °C for 10 days. The optimum growth temperature range of S. ciliata seedlings was determined to be 35 °C to 37 °C, with depressed growth above 47 °C. Seed germination was also depressed at 47 °C, and optimal germination occurred between 35 °C to 37 °C. Circle soils were consistently 2 °C cooler than matrix soils at both surface and 15 cm depths, and though the soil surface achieved daily temperatures of 45 °C and 47 °C for the circle and matrix respectively, mean daily temperatures at 15 cm depth were 36 °C and 38 °C respectively, coinciding with the optimum germination and growing temperature of S. ciliata. Circle soil temperature is thus unlikely to limit S. ciliata germination and seedling growth and contribute to the maintenance of a bare disc, as both thermal conditions and the presence of higher soil moisture on circles provide a more favourable growing environment than the matrix."

Distance maps of growth of the total facial surface and of the nose, upper lip, chin, forehead and cheeks for the intervals 3 to 6 months, 6 to 9 months, and 9 to 12 months of age were calculated. Mean growth of the total facial surface was 3.9 mm (standard deviation [SD] 1.2 mm), 3.5 mm (SD 0.9 mm), and 1.6 mm (SD 0.7 mm) at 3 to 6 months, 6 to 9 months, and 9 to 12 months, respectively. Regarding the selected regions of the face, the mean growth of the nose and upper lip were the largest (3.7 mm and 3.6 mm, respectively) between 6 and 9 months of age. The mean growth of the forehead, cheeks and chin were the largest (5.4 mm, 3.2, and 4.7 mm, respectively) between 3 and 6 months of age. For all facial regions, growth clearly diminished from 9 to 12 months of age. Normative data on the growth of the full face, nose, upper lip, chin, forehead and cheeks are presented. Such data can be used in future studies to identify the effectiveness of treatment of orofacial deformities such as orofacial clefts during the first year of life."
https://openalex.org/W2946249793,"Introduction Few studies have linked high levels of plasma C-terminal fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) with poor clinical outcomes in patients on maintenance haemodialysis (MHD), while the association between intact FGF23 and mortality in this group of patients remains inconclusive. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between plasma levels of intact FGF23 and mortality in dialysis patients. Methods A prospective multicenter study involving patients undergoing dialysis at three dialysis centers in Johannesburg was undertaken between 1st October 2014 and 31st December 2017. Results The study comprised 165 chronic dialysis patients (111 blacks, 54 whites) with a mean age of 46.6 ±14.2 years. During a three year follow up period, there were 46 deaths (1.03 per 100 person-years). The median plasma FGF 23 level was 382 pg/ml (interquartile range [IQR], 145–2977). In adjusted multivariable analyses, there was a non-statistically significant increase in the risk of mortality with higher quartiles of FGF 23 levels: the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for the second, third and fourth quantiles were HR 3.20 (95% CI, 0.99–10.35; P = 0.052), HR 2.43(95% CI,0.65–9.09; P = 0.19), and HR 2.09 (95% CI, 0.66–7.32; P = 0.25),respectively. Corrected serum calcium 2.38–2.5 mmol/l [HR 2.98 (95% CI, 1.07–8.29; P = 0.04] and > 2.50 mmol/l [HR 5.50 (95% CI, 1.84–16.48; P = 0.002] were independently associated with increased risk of death. Likewise, patients with intact parathyroid hormone > 600 pg/ml had a 3.46-fold higher risk of death (HR 3.46, 95% CI, 1.22–9.82 P = 0.019). These findings persisted in time -dependent analyses. Conclusion Higher levels of intact FGF 23 appear not to be independently associated with all-cause mortality in our dialysis patients, while hypercalcaemia and severe hyperparathyroidism were found to be independent predictors of mortality in this cohort of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2946603705,"Oxidative stress has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of the neurodegenerative disease Ataxia Telangiectasia. We have recently demonstrated that Dexamethasone treatment is able to counteract the oxidative state by promoting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear accumulation. However, substantial gaps remain in our knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanism(s) according to which Dexamethasone acts as an NRF2 inducer. Herein we investigate the possible effects of the drug on the main NRF2 activation pathways by initially focusing on key kinases known to differently affect NRF2 activation. Neither AKT nor ERK1/2, known to be NRF2-activating kinases, were found to be activated upon Dexamethasone treatment, thus excluding their involvement in the transcription factor nuclear shift. Likewise, GSK3 inactivating kinase was not inhibited, thus ruling out its role in NRF2 activation. On the other hand, p38 MAPK, another NRF2-inhibitory kinase, was indeed switched-off in Ataxia Telangiectasia cells by Dexamethasone-mediated induction of DUSP1 phosphatase, and therefore it appeared that it might account for NRF2 triggering. However, this mechanism was excluded by the use of a selective p38 inhibitor, which failed to cause a significant NRF2 nuclear shift and target gene induction. Finally, dexamethasone effects on the classical oxidative pathway orchestrated by KEAP1 were addressed. Dexamethasone was found to decrease the expression of the inhibitor KEAP1 at both mRNA and protein levels and to induce the shift from the reduced to the oxidized form of KEAP1, thus favouring NRF2 translocation into the nucleus. Furthermore, preliminary data revealed very low levels of the negative regulator Fyn in Ataxia Telangiectasia cells, which might account for the prolonged NRF2-activated gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2944900388,"Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) in plant genomes differ in abundance, structure and genomic distribution, reflecting the large number of evolutionary lineages. Elements within lineages can be considered populations, in which each element is an individual in its genomic environment. In this way, it would be reasonable to apply microevolutionary analyses to understand transposable element (TE) evolution, such as those used to study the genetic structure of natural populations. Here, we applied a Bayesian method to infer genetic structure of populations together with classical phylogenetic and dating tools to analyze LTR-RT evolution using the monocot Setaria italica as a model species. In contrast to a phylogeny, the Bayesian clusterization method identifies populations by assigning individuals to one or more clusters according to the most probabilistic scenario of admixture, based on genetic diversity patterns. In this work, each LTR-RT insertion was considered to be one individual and each LTR-RT lineage was considered to be a single species. Nine evolutionary lineages of LTR-RTs were identified in the S. italica genome that had different genetic structures with variable numbers of clusters and levels of admixture. Comprehensive analysis of the phylogenetic, clusterization and time of insertion data allowed us to hypothesize that admixed elements represent sequences that harbor ancestral polymorphic sequence signatures. In conclusion, application of microevolutionary concepts in genome evolution studies is suitable as a complementary approach to phylogenetic analyses to address the evolutionary history and functional features of TEs."
https://openalex.org/W2944926534,"Purpose The study aim was to translate and validate the Glaucoma Symptom Scale (GSS) in Serbian language. Methods Clinical parameters and socio-demographic data were collected for each of the 177 enrolled glaucoma patients. Each eye was classified according to the Glaucoma staging system by Mills into 6 stages. Patients filled out the GSS and National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ 25). The GSS comprises 10 complaints common for glaucoma patients on a topical treatment, grouped into two subscales: SYMP-6 (non-visual) and FUNC-4 (visual problems). The GSS was translated following the customary methodology and its psychometric properties were assessed by using both Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Rasch analysis. Results The internal consistency of the Serbian GSS for the whole scale was very good (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81). On factor analysis items were clustered into 2 factors (48.92% of variance) which corresponded to the original scale. The total and subscale GSS scores correlated significantly with measures of disease severity and also with total score and analogous NEI-VFQ 25 subscale scores. In Rasch analysis we obtained adequate item reliability index (0.90). Almost all items had infit and outfit mean squares in the accepted range. However, measurement precision was poor (low person separation reliability) and targeting revealed a ceiling effect. Conclusion When analyzed with CTT the Serbian version of the GSS seems to be a valid instrument, but Rasch analysis revealed some serious measurement flaws, therefore it should not be used in its current format. Further studies to modify and improve GSS are needed prior to its application for Serbian glaucoma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2945342639,"The genome of Bacillus subtilis phage ϕ29 consists of a linear double-stranded DNA with a terminal protein (TP) covalently linked to each 5’ end (TP-DNA). ϕ29 DNA polymerase is the enzyme responsible for viral DNA replication, due to its distinctive properties: high processivity and strand displacement capacity, being able to replicate the entire genome without requiring the assistance of processivity or unwinding factors, unlike most replicases. ϕ29 single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) is encoded by the viral gene 5 and binds the ssDNA generated in the replication of the ϕ29 TP-DNA. It has been described to stimulate the DNA elongation rate during the DNA replication. Previous studies proposed residues Tyr50, Tyr57 and Tyr76 as ligands of ssDNA. The role of two of these residues has been determined in this work by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results showed that mutant derivative Y57A was unable to bind to ssDNA, to stimulate the DNA elongation and to displace oligonucleotides annealed to M13 ssDNA, whereas mutant Y50A behaved like the wild-type SSB."
https://openalex.org/W2945605616,"Objectives Physical activity is key to improve the prognosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To help to tailor future interventions we aimed to identify the baseline characteristics of COPD patients which predict 12-month completion and response to a behavioral physical activity intervention. Methods This is a 12-month cohort study of the intervention arm of the Urban Training randomized controlled trial (NCT01897298), an intervention proven to be efficacious to increase physical activity. We considered baseline sociodemographic, interpersonal, environmental, clinical and psychological characteristics as potential determinants of completion and response. We defined completion as attending the 12-month study visit. Among completers, we defined response as increasing physical activity ≥1100 steps/day from baseline to 12 months, measured by accelerometer. We estimated the factors independently for completion and response using multivariable logistic regression models. Results Of a total of 202 patients (m (SD) 69 (9) years, 84% male), 132 (65%) completed the study. Among those, 37 (28%) qualified as responders. Higher numbers of baseline steps/day (OR [95% CI] 1.11 [1.02–1.21] per increase of 1000 steps, p<0.05) and living with a partner (2.77 [1.41–5.48], p<0.01) were related to a higher probability of completion while more neighborhood vulnerability (0.70 [0.57–0.86] per increase of 0.1 units in urban vulnerability index, p<0.01) was related to a lower probability. Among the completers, working (3.14 [1.05–9.33], p<0.05) and having an endocrino-metabolic disease (4.36 [1.49–12.80], p<0.01) were related to a higher probability of response while unwillingness to follow the intervention (0.21 [0.05–0.98], p<0.05) was related to a lower probability. Conclusions This study found that 12-month completion of a behavioral physical activity intervention was generally determined by previous physical activity habits as well as interpersonal and environmental physical activity facilitators while response was related to diverse factors thought to modify the individual motivation to change to an active lifestyle."
https://openalex.org/W2946606877,"A theory for turbulent particle pair diffusion in the inertial subrange [Malik NA, PLoS ONE 13(10):e0202940 (2018)] is investigated numerically using a Lagrangian diffusion model, Kinematic Simulations [Kraichnan RH, Phys. Fluids 13:22 (1970); Malik NA, PLoS ONE 12(12):e0189917 (2017)]. All predictions of the theory are observed in flow fields with generalised energy spectra of the type, E(k) ∼ k−p. Most importantly, two non-Richardson regimes are observed: for short inertial subrange of size 102 the simulations yield quasi-local regimes for the pair diffusion coefficient, ; and for asymptotically infinite inertial subrange the simulations yield non-local regimes , with γ intermediate between the purely local scaling γl = (1 + p)/2 and the purely non-local scaling γnl = 2. For intermittent turbulence spectra, E(k) ∼ k−1.72, the simulations yield , in agreement with the revised 1926 dataset [Richardson LF, Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A 100:709 (1926); Malik NA, PLoS ONE 13(10):e0202940 (2018)]. These results lend support to the physical picture proposed in the new theory that turbulent diffusion in the inertial subrange is governed by both local and non-local diffusion transport processes."
https://openalex.org/W2945283585,"Naphthalene has been widely used to test the functional roles of soil fauna, but its nontarget effects remain uncertain in various soils. To determine whether there is a potential nontarget effect on soil biochemical properties in subalpine forest soil, soils in a subalpine forest on the western Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were treated by naphthalene in microcosms. The responses of soil microbial activity and nutrients to naphthalene were studied following 52 days of incubation. The results showed that the naphthalene application obviously decreased the microbial respiration rate in the first 10 days of the incubation and then increased the rate in the following days of the incubation. Moreover, the naphthalene application did not significantly affect the microbial activities overall, measured as soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) abundances and biomasses, or most enzyme activities (invertase, nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase) during the whole incubation period. However, naphthalene suppressed increases in the DON, NH4+-N and NO3--N contents and urease activity and led to the net mineralization of inorganic N (NH4+-N + NO3--N), in contrast to the net immobilization result in the controls. These results suggest that naphthalene can exert direct nontarget effects on soil microbial respiration and N mineralization processes in subalpine soils. Caution should be taken when using naphthalene to repel soil animals in field experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2945502231,"Introduction Studies on children’s written production of the Brazilian Portuguese have shown that one of the most frequent phonological-based orthographic errors is the one related to voiceless/voiced phonemes. Children who make this type of error may have auditory temporal processing disorders, which can harm the perception of phonemes with similar characteristics. Aim Verify the effectiveness of an auditory temporal training program based on activities adapted from the software Fast ForWord in the auditory temporal processing, i.e. the temporal ordering skill, and in reducing voiceless/voiced-based orthographic errors and the frequency of occurrence of these errors in the written production of the children. Method Twenty-five children participated on this study. They were divided in two groups: experimental group consisting of 16 participants, who engaged in the auditory temporal training activities; and a placebo group consisting of nine participants, who engaged in passive visual activities. The behavioral measures applied in the pre-training evaluation, post-training and placebo evaluations were: i) auditory skill of temporal ordering by the Pitch Pattern Sequence Test; and ii) analysis of the amount of voiceless/voiced-based orthographic errors and the frequency of occurrence of these errors by the use of dictation. Results No statistically significant differences were found concerning the placebo group in the pre-training and post-training evaluations, in all evaluation measures. However, statistically significant differences were found in the pre-training and post-training evaluations for the pitch pattern sequence test concerning the experimental group. These differences were specifically related to a reduction of the errors regarding fricative graphemes, and the frequency of occurrence of plosive and fricative graphemes. Conclusions The auditory temporal training program was effective in improving the temporal ordering skill and reducing errors in the writing of children who made voiceless/voiced-based orthographic errors."
https://openalex.org/W2945445261,"Experimental and human studies have reported the advantages of a suture length to wound length (SL:WL) ratio greater than 4:1 in midline abdominal closure. This is achieved when the tissue bite (TB) is equal to or larger than the stitch interval (SI). Although TB and SI values are recommended in some textbooks, SL:WL ratios are rarely reported in veterinary textbooks. Additionally, no clinical data regarding these parameters could be found in small animals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the SL:WL ratio of midline laparotomy closure in dogs and cats performed by surgeons with different levels of expertise and to compare the findings with current textbook recommendations. Midline laparotomy incisions of 100 dogs and 75 cats were closed in continuous pattern by diplomates and residents of both the European College of Veterinary Surgeons (ECVS) and the European College of Animal Reproduction (ECAR). The mean SL:WL ratio was 2.5 ± 0.7:1. The surgeons´ level of experience and the species and body weights of the animals did not have any significant influence on the SL:WL ratio. A moderate negative correlation was observed between the mean SI to mean TB (SI:TB) ratio and the SL:WL ratio. In this study, the mean SI matched the textbook recommendations both in feline and canine species, whereas the TB in cats was different. In this study, the SL:WL ratio was less than 4:1 without apparent complications. Because of the low prevalence of incisional hernia in dogs and cats larger studies are necessary to evaluate clinical significance of the presented data."
