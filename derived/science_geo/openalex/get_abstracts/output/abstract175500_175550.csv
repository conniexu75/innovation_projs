https://openalex.org/W2124156250,"Angiogenesis and vascular cell proliferation are pivotal in physiological and pathological processes including atherogenesis, restenosis, wound healing, and cancer development. Here we show that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling plays a key role in hypoxia-triggered smooth muscle and endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis in vitro. Hypoxia significantly increased DNA synthesis and proliferative responses to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) in rat and human smooth muscle and endothelial cells. In an in vitro 3-dimensional model of angiogenesis, hypoxia increased PDGF- and FGF-stimulated sprout formation from rat and mouse aortas. Hypoxia did not modulate PDGF receptor mRNA, protein, or phosphorylation. PI3K activity was essential for cell proliferation under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Activities of PI3K-downstream target PKB under hypoxia and normoxia were comparable. However, mTOR inhibition by rapamycin specifically abrogated hypoxia-mediated amplification of proliferation and angiogenesis, but was without effect on proliferation under normoxia. Accordingly, hypoxia-mediated amplification of proliferation was further augmented in mTOR-overexpressing endothelial cells. Thus, signaling via mTOR may represent a novel mechanism whereby hypoxia augments mitogen-stimulated vascular cell proliferation and angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2150828607,"Epidemiological studies have implicated aluminum (Al) exposure in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, other studies have failed to confirm these results. Oxidative stress is a feature of AD, and Al can exacerbate oxidative events. This biological property has been suggested as a possible mechanism by which this metal could influence the onset and/or evolution of the disease. To test this hypothesis, we fed transgenic mice that over express human amyloid precursor protein (Tg2576) with a diet enriched in Al and measured isoprostane levels, sensitive and specific markers of in vivo oxidative stress, as well as amyloid b peptide formation and deposition. Here, we show an increase in brain isoprostane levels that correlated with increased amyloid b levels and accelerated plaque deposition in Tg2576 mice but not in wild-type (WT) littermates fed with high dietary Al. Significantly, these in vivo effects of Al were reversed by vitamin E, as judged by a reduction of isoprostane production, amyloid b levels, and plaque deposition. These results indicate that dietary Al can modulate in vivo AD-like amyloidosis in Tg2576 by increasing brain oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2335464458,"The intracellular pathways leading to mitochondrial activation and subsequent cell death in the ceramide-mediated stress response have been intensively studied in recent years. Experimental evidence has been provided that ceramide-induced apoptosis is inhibited by overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. However, the direct effect of proapoptotic gene products, e.g. Bax, on ceramide-induced death signalling has not yet been studied in detail. In the present work, we show by measurement of mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation that ceramide-induced apoptosis is marginal in Bax-negative DU 145 cells. Reconstitution of Bax by generation of DU 145 cells stably expressing this proapoptotic factor, clearly enhanced ceramide-induced apoptosis at all levels of the mitochondrial signalling cascade. Using the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk and zDEVD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspase-3-like activities, we demonstrate that the ceramide-induced mitochondrial activation in Bax-transfected DU 145 cells is caspase-independent. On the other hand, apoptotic events located downstream of the mitochondria, e.g. DNA fragmentation, were shown to be caspase-dependent. This influence of Bax on ceramide-induced apoptosis was confirmed in another cellular system: whereas Bax-positive HCT116 wild type cells were very sensitive towards induction of cell death by C(2)-ceramide, sensitivity of Bax knock-out HCT116 cells was significantly reduced. Thus, we conclude that Bax is a key activator of ceramide-mediated death pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2107605999,"Interaction between ephrinB2 and EphB4 in endothelial cells at the arterial-venous capillary interface is critical for proper embryonic capillary morphogenesis. However, the intracellular downstream signaling of ephrinB2-EphB in vascular endothelial cells is unknown. This study examined the effect of ephrinB2-induced activation of EphB kinases on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)- and angiopoietin-1 (Ang1)-induced Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Reverse transcriptase-polymer chain reaction results showed that HUVECs expressed three kinds of EphB kinases known to bind to ephrinB2: EphB2, EphB3, and EphB4. EphrinB2 not only increased the phosphorylation of EphB2 and EphB4 in a time-dependent manner but also increased recruitment of p120-Ras-GTPase-activating protein (p120-RasGAP) to EphB2 and EphB4. Accordingly, ephrinB2 inhibited VEGF- and Ang1-induced Ras-MAPK activities, whereas ephrinB2 did not alter VEGF-induced Flk phosphorylation or Ang1-induced Tie2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, ephrinB2 suppressed VEGF- and Ang1-induced proliferation and/or migration, which are mediated mainly through Ras/MAPK signaling cascades. From these results, we propose that ephrinB2-EphB, signaling through Ras/MAPK cascade, may be critical for proper morphogenesis of capillary endothelium through the arrest of endothelial cell proliferation and migration at the arterial-venous interface."
https://openalex.org/W2150341877,"In this study we have investigated the effects of low dose ionizing radiation (2 Gy) on p70 S6 kinase and Akt signaling with respect to Erb-B receptors in both the A431 squamous and the MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cell lines. Ionizing radiation caused a 2-3-fold increase in p70 S6 kinase activity that was blocked pharmacologically using an EGFR inhibitor (AG1478) alone, or in combination with an Erb-B2 inhibitor (AG825). These results suggested that both EGFR and Erb-B2 receptors could initiate radiation-induced activation of p70 S6K. EGFR dependent Erb-B3 signaling also contributed to p70 S6 kinase activity through recruitment and activation of PI3K, which has been shown to regulate p70 S6 kinase activity. Furthermore, inhibition of the EGFR blocked IR stimulated increases in protein translation, a biologic consequence of p70 S6 kinase activation. We also report that ionizing radiation stimulated Akt activity that was partially independent of PI3K activity, but dependent on Erb-B2 function. Erb-B2 inhibition also correlated with enhanced apoptosis following IR exposure, suggesting an important role for Erb-B2 in cell survival. Together this work demonstrates that the Erb-B receptor tyrosine kinase network stimulates cytoprotective p70 S6 kinase and Akt activity in response to clinically relevant doses of ionizing radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2106083328,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs when neurons in the memory and cognition regions of the brain are accompanied by an accumulation of the long amyloid beta-proteins of the 39 to 43 amino acids derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by cleavage with beta- and gamma-secretase. An increased production of Abeta-42 by mutation of PS2 genes promotes caspase expression and is associated with the Cox-2 found in the brain of AD patients. To address this question in vivo, we expressed the human mutant PS2 (hPS2m) (N141I) as well as wild PS2 (hPS2w) as a control in transgenic (Tg) mice under control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter. Water maze tests were used to demonstrate the behavioral defect; dot blot, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on the brain with the hPS2, Abeta-42, caspase-3, and Cox-2 antibody. We concluded that 1) Tg mice showed a behavioral dysfunction in the water maze test, 2) levels of hPS2, Abeta-42, caspase-3, and Cox-2 expression were modulated in the brains of both Tg mice, 3) dense staining with antibody to hPS2, Abeta-42, caspase-3, and Cox-2 was visible in the brains of Tg mice compared with age-matched control mice, and 4) distinguishable AD phenotypes between hPS2w- and hPS2m-Tg mice did not appear. These results suggest that an elevation of Abeta-42 by overexpression of hPS2 and mutation of hPS2m might induce the behavioral deficit and caspase-3 and Cox-2 induction, which could be useful in the therapeutic testing of compounds to have considerable clinical effects."
https://openalex.org/W2028283357,"Cultured skin substitutes (CSS) consisting of autologous fibroblasts and keratinocytes combined with biopolymers are an adjunctive treatment for large excised burns. CSS containing two cell types are limited by anatomical deficiencies, including lack of a vascular plexus, leading to slower vascularization after grafting than split-thickness autograft. To address this limitation, CSS were prepared containing human keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) isolated from a single skin sample. After 16 days in culture, control CSS and CSS containing HDMEC (CSS+EC) were grafted to full-thickness wounds in athymic mice. In CSS+EC in vitro, HDMEC persisted in the dermal substitutes and formed multicellular aggregates. One wk after grafting, HDMEC in CSS+EC organized into multicellular structures, some containing lumens. By 4 wk after grafting, HDMEC were found in linear and circular organizations resembling vascular analogs associated with basement membrane deposition. In some cases, colocalization of HDMEC with mouse perivascular cells was observed. The results demonstrate HDMEC transplantation in a clinically relevant cultured skin model, persistence of HDMEC after grafting, and HDMEC organization into vascular analogs in vitro and in vivo. All cells were derived from the same donor tissue, indicating the feasibility of preparing CSS containing autologous HDMEC for grafting to patients."
https://openalex.org/W2122932905,"Maspin, a novel serine protease inhibitor (serpin), suppresses the growth and metastasis of breast tumor in vivo. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In the current study, we report the first evidence that endogenous maspin expression in mammary carcinoma cells MDA-MB-435 enhanced staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis as judged by the increased fragmentation of DNA, increased proteolytic inactivation of poly-[ADP-ribose]-polymerase (PARP), as well as the increased activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. In parallel, recombinant maspin did not directly regulate the proteolytic activities of either caspase-3 or caspase-8 in vitro. Consistent with this result, maspin expressing normal mammary epithelial cells underwent more rapid STS-induced apoptosis as compared to breast carcinoma cells. Interestingly, maspin transfectant cells did not undergo spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of STS. Moreover, neither purified maspin protein added from outside nor endogenous maspin secreted to the cell culture media sensitized cells to STS-induced apoptosis. To investigate the structural determinants of maspin in its apoptosis-sensitizing effect, MDA-MB-435 cells were also transfected with maspin/PAI-1 and PAI-1/maspin chimeric constructs resulting from swapping the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains between maspin and PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1). The resulting stable transfectant clones expressing maspin/PAI-1 and PAI-1/maspin, respectively, did not undergo spontaneous apoptosis, and were similarly inhibited as maspin transfectant cells in motility assay. Interestingly, however, expression of both maspin/PAI-1 and PAI-1/maspin in MDA-MB-435 cells failed to sensitize these cells to STS-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our evidence provides new insights into the complex molecular mechanisms of maspin that may suppress breast tumor progression not only at the step of invasion and motility, but also by regulating tumor cell apoptosis. The sensitizing effect of maspin on apoptosis is to be contrasted by the pro-survival effect of several other serpins."
https://openalex.org/W2026356178,"Tissue engineering of endothelial cells (EC) and chemical engineering with anticoagulant moieties has been undertaken in order to improve prosthetic graft patency and thrombogenicity. This was done by covalently bonding a compliant poly(carbonate-urea)urethane graft (MyoLink) with arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) or/and heparin (Hep) to ascertain whether EC retention could be improved. The retention of these moieties and EC was assessed after exposure to pulsatile flow. We covalently bonded RGD, Hep, and RGD/Hep onto the luminal surface of MyoLink using spacer arm technology. Narrow-beam X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out to check the efficiency of the bonding. EC were radiolabeled and seeded onto native MyoLink and with 1) RGD-, 2) Hep-, and 3) RGD/Hep-bonded grafts and exposed to shear stress in a physiological flow circuit for 6 h, which reproduces femoral artery flow waveforms and pulsatility. Results were recorded on a gamma camera imaging system. Viability of cells was tested with a modified Alamar Blue assay (ABA) and scanning electron microscopy for morphological appearance of seeded cells. Experiments were repeated (n=6). RGD, Hep, and RGD/Hep were bonded together in a uniform distribution on the luminal surface of each graft type, and bioactivity of each moiety covalently bonded was very high. In the flow circuit, there was exponential cell retention for the first 60 min of flow for all the grafts, but after 6 h of exposure to pulsatile flow the RGD/Hep-bonded graft had a significantly better cell retention rate than native MyoLink (75.7%+/-2.3 vs. 60.5+/-10.1, P<0.05). ABA test showed that all the seeded cells postexposure to flow were viable, and significantly higher metabolic activity was recorded on a RGD/Hep-bonded graft than with MyoLink-seeded graft (P<0.01). Using RGD/Hep covalently bonded onto graft surfaces improves cell retention and provides an antithrombogenic surface for initial blood flow in vivo until full EC activity develops postseeding. This would allow the development and further improvement of hybrid grafts."
https://openalex.org/W2075479483,"Although DSCR1 (Adapt78) has been associated with successful adaptation to oxidative stress and calcium stress and with devastating diseases such as Alzheimer's and Down syndrome, no rationale for these apparently contradictory findings has been tested. In fact, DSCR1 (Adapt78) has not yet been proved to provide protection against acute oxidative stress or calcium stress. We have addressed this question using cross-adaptation to H2O2 and the calcium ionophore A23187, stable DSCR1 (Adapt78) transfection and overexpression in hamster HA-1 cells, 'tet-off' regulated DSCR1 (Adapt78) isoform 1 transgene expression in human PC-12 cells, and DSCR1 (Adapt78) antisense oligonucleotides to test the ability of the DSCR1 (Adapt78) protein product calcipressin 1 (a calcineurin inhibitor) to protect against oxidative stress and calcium stress. Under all conditions, resistance to oxidative stress and calcium stress increased as a function of DSCR1 (Adapt78)/calcipressin 1 expression and decreased as gene/protein expression diminished. We conclude that cells may transiently use increased expression of the DSCR1 (Adapt78) gene product calcipressin 1 to provide short-term protection against acute oxidative stress and other calcium-mediated stresses, whereas chronic overexpression may be associated with Alzheimer disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2123603210,"Expression of the Wilms' tumor gene Wt1 in the epicardium is critical for normal heart development. Mouse embryos with inactivated Wt1 gene have extremely thin ventricles, which can result in heart failure and death. Here, we demonstrate that Wt1 can be activated in adult hearts by local ischemia. Wt1 mRNA was increased more than twofold in the left ventricular myocardium of rats between 1 day and 9 wk after infarction. Wt1 expression was localized by means of mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to vascular endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in the border zone of the infarcted tissue. A strikingly similar distribution was seen for vascular endothelial growth factor and two different cell proliferation markers in the coronary vessels of the ischemic heart. No Wt1 could be detected in the vasculature of the noninfarcted right ventricles. Wt1 expression in the coronary vessels of the ischemic heart was mimicked by exposure of rats to normobaric hypoxia (8% O2) and 0.1% CO, respectively. These findings demonstrate that Wt1 is expressed in the vasculature of the heart in response to local ischemia and hypoxia. They suggest that Wt1 has a role in the growth of coronary vessels after myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2102041436,"Although immune responses are generally considered to be systemic, local events such as interaction of complement products with blood vessels and with inflammatory cells play a pivotal role in determining the nature and manifestations of immune responses. This paper will discuss how blood vessel physiology and immunity influence one another to reach homeostasis upon exposure to an infectious agent. We review new insights into the mechanisms by which the microenvironment of tissues protects against microbial invasion yet facilitates migration of leukocytes and 'decides' whether immunity or tolerance ensues and whether, in the face of immunity, protective responses or tissue injury ensues. These 'decisions' are made based on interaction of components of normal tissues such as proteoglycans and injured tissues such as cell-associated cytokines with receptors on immune cells and blood vessels."

https://openalex.org/W2018520585,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes, including double-strand break (DSB) repair genes, are postulated to confer increased cancer risk. A variant of the XRCC3 gene, which is involved in DSB repair, has been associated with increased risk of malignant skin melanoma and bladder cancer. We tested the hypothesis that this variant, Thr241Met, may affect cancer risk by disrupting a critical function of XRCC3, i.e., promoting homology-directed repair (HDR) of chromosomal DSBs. Using a quantitative fluorescence assay, we find that the variant XRCC3 protein is functionally active for HDR, complementing the HDR defects of an XRCC3 mutant cell line as well as the wild-type protein. We also examined cells expressing this variant for sensitivity to the interstrand cross-linking agent, mitomycin C (MMC), as HDR mutant cell lines, including the XRCC3 mutant, have been found to be hypersensitive to this DNA damaging agent. Cells expressing the variant protein were found to be no more sensitive than cells expressing the wild-type protein. These results suggest that the increased cancer risk associated with this variant may not be due to an intrinsic HDR defect."
https://openalex.org/W2037023666,"The estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) signaling plays an essential role in breast cancer progression and endocrine therapy. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/Erk1/2) has been implicated in ligand-independent activation of ER, resulting in the cross-talk between growth factor and ER mediated signaling. In this study, we examined the effect of the cross-talk on estradiol (E(2))-mediated signaling, tumor growth and its effect on anti-estrogen therapy. Our findings demonstrate that expression of constitutively activated mitogen activated kinase kinase (MEK1), an immediate upstream activator of MAPK in estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells (MEK/MCF-7), showed an increase in ERalpha-driven transcriptional activation. In MEK/MCF-7 cells maximal transactivation levels were achieved in response to treatment with much lower E(2) concentrations (10(-10) M E(2)) when compared to MCF-7 control cells (10(-8) M E(2)). Furthermore, we have seen an increased association between ERalpha and its nuclear coactivators AIB1 or TIF-2, in MEK/MCF-7 cells relative to those seen in MCF-7 control cells. In addition, in vivo studies show that MEK/MCF-7 cell tumors are approximately threefold larger than those of MCF-7 cell, in the presence of E(2). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates that progesterone receptor (PR) and pS2, two E(2)-regulated gene products, are significantly increased in MEK/MCF-7 cell tumors compared to those of MCF-7 control tumors, suggesting that activation of ERalpha by MAPK enhances the expression of E(2)-regulated genes and accelerates tumor growth. Remarkably, the antiestrogens tamoxifen and ICI 182,780, were shown both in vitro and in vivo studies to efficiently antagonize the stimulatory effects of E(2) on ER regulated transactivation and tumor growth in MEK/MCF-7 as well as MCF-7 cell lines. Taken together, these data suggest that MAPK/ER cross-talk enhances ERalpha-mediated signaling and accelerates E(2)-dependent tumor growth without diminishing sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of anti-estrogens."
https://openalex.org/W2080666913,"Tissue remodeling during embryonic development and in the adult organism relies on a subtle balance between cell growth and apoptosis. As angiogenesis involves restructuring of preexisting endothelium, we examined the role of apoptosis in new vessel formation. We show that apoptosis occurs before capillary formation but not after vessels have assembled. Using the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) in vitro Matrigel angiogenesis model, we show that vascular-like structure formation requires apoptotic cell death through activation of a caspase-dependent mechanism and mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Vascular-like structure formation was further blocked by caspase inhibitors such as z-VAD or Ac-DEVD-CHO, using HUVEC and human lung microvascular endothelial cells. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic human Bcl-2 or baculovirus p35 genes in HUVEC altered endothelial cell rearrangement during in vitro angiogenesis, causing impaired vessel-like structure formation. Caspase inhibitors blocked VEGF- or bFGF-induced HUVEC angiogenesis on 2- or 3-D collagen gels, respectively, confirming that apoptosis was not the result of nonspecific cell death after seeding on the matrix. In an in vivo angiogenesis assay, caspase inhibitors blocked VEGF-dependent vascular formation at the alignment step, as demonstrated histologically. This evidence indicates that endothelial cell apoptosis may be relevant for precise vascular tissue rearrangement in in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2019626263,"Collagen turnover and cell migration are fundamental aspects of arterial restructuring. To identify mRNAs involved in blood flow-induced arterial restructuring, we performed subtraction polymerase chain reaction and found expression of haptoglobin mRNA in adventitial fibroblasts of rabbit arteries. Haptoglobin is highly expressed in liver, but its arterial expression and function are unknown. In vitro studies revealed that stimulation of haptoglobin expression by lipopolysaccharides in mice fibroblasts stimulated migration of wild-type fibroblasts but had no effect on migration of haptoglobin knockout fibroblasts. In vivo studies showed that flow-induced arterial restructuring was delayed in haptoglobin knockout mice. This new function of haptoglobin might be explained by facilitating cell migration through accumulation of a temporary gelatin matrix because cell culture showed that haptoglobin is involved in the breakdown of gelatin. We conclude that haptoglobin is highly expressed in arterial tissue and is involved in arterial restructuring. This new haptoglobin function may also apply to other functional and pathological restructuring processes such as angiogenesis, tissue repair, and tumor cell invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2124351185,"The A3 adenosine receptor, A3AR, belongs to the family of Gi proteins, which upon induction, suppresses the formation of cAMP and its downstream effectors. Recent studies have indicated that activation of A3AR by its agonist, IB-MECA, results in growth inhibition of malignant cells. Here we demonstrate the ability of IB-MECA to decrease the levels of protein kinase A, a downstream effector of cAMP, and protein kinase B/Akt in melanoma cells. Examination of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, GSK-3beta, whose phosphorylation is controlled by protein kinase A and B, showed a substantial decrease in the levels of its phosphorylated form and an increase in total GSK-3beta levels in IB-MECA treated melanoma cells. This observation suggests that the treatment of cells with IB-MECA augments the activity of GSK-3beta in the cells. Evaluation of beta-catenin, a key component of Wnt signaling pathway which, upon phosphorylation by GSK-3beta rapidly ubiquitinates, showed a substantial decrease in its level after IB-MECA treatment. Accordingly, the level of beta-catenin responsive cell growth regulatory genes including c-myc and cyclin D1 was severely declined upon treatment of the cells with IB-MECA. These observations which link cAMP to the Wnt signaling pathway provide mechanistic evidence for the involvement of Wnt pathway via its key elements GSK-3beta and beta-catenin in the anti-tumor activity of A3AR agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2140723408,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the ischemia-reperfusion injury. In kidney, the intracellular sources of ROS during ischemia-reperfusion are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of the catecholamine-degrading enzyme monoamine oxidases (MAOs) in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation after reperfusion and their involvement in cell events leading to tissue injury and recovery. In a rat model of renal ischemia-reperfusion, we show concomitant MAO-dependent H2O2 production and lipid peroxidation in the early reperfusion period. Rat pretreatment with the irreversible MAO inhibitor pargyline resulted in the following: i) prevented H2O2 production and lipid peroxidation; ii) decreased tubular cell apoptosis and necrosis, measured by TUNEL staining and histomorphological criteria; and iii) increased tubular cell proliferation as determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. MAO inhibition also prevented Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation and promoted extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, two mitogen-activated protein kinases described as a part of a ""death"" and ""survival"" pathway after ischemia-reperfusion. This work demonstrates the crucial role of MAOs in mediating the production of injurious ROS, which contribute to acute apoptotic and necrotic cell death induced by renal ischemia-reperfusion in vivo. Targeted inhibition of these oxidases could provide a new avenue for therapy to prevent renal damage and promote renal recovery after ischemia-reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2167229301,"Antiarrhythmic peptides enhance gap junction current in pairs of cardiomyocytes and coupling in cardiac tissue. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the effects of the antiarrhythmic peptide AAP10 (GAG-4Hyp-PY-CONH2) on pairs of adult guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes and pairs of HeLa cells transfected with rat cardiac connexin 43 (Cx43). By using a double-cell voltage-clamp technique in pairs of cardiomyocytes, we found that under control conditions the gap junction conductance (gj) steadily decreased with time (by -0.292 +/- 0.130 nS/min). Use of 50 nmol/L AAP10 reversed this rundown and increased gj (by +0.290 +/- 0.231 nS/min, Pa). In HeLa-Cx43 cells, AAP10 exerted the same electrophysiological effect. In these cells, AAP10 activated PKC (determined by using ELISA) in CGP54345-sensitive manner and significantly enhanced incorporation of 32P into Cx43 with dependence on PKC. If G-protein coupling was inhibited with 1 mM GDP-BS, we found the effects of AAP10 on 32P incorporation were also completely abolished. Next, we performed a radioligand binding study with 14C-AAP10 as radioligand and AAPnat as competitor. We found saturable binding of 14C-AAP10 to cardiac membrane preparations, which could be displaced with AAPnat. The Kd of AAP10 was 0.88 nmol/L. We conclude that 1) AAP10 increases gj both in adult cardiomyocytes and in transfected HeLa-Cx43 cells, 2) AAP10 exerts its effect via enhanced PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Cx43, 3) AAP10 activates PKCa, and 4) a membrane receptor exists for antiarrhythmic peptides in cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2142859704,"Oxidants are known to induce cell apoptosis. Because oxidants also elicit redox imbalance, it is difficult to distinguish the direct effects of cellular redox from that of oxidants. This study tests the hypothesis that induction of redox imbalance independent of reactive oxygen species (ROS), can induce cell apoptosis in a mitotic competent, undifferentiated cell line, PC-12. Cells grown in standard DMEM containing 25 mM glucose were treated with diamide, a thiol oxidant, at a concentration that did not generate ROS. Diamide caused a rapid increase in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and a loss of mitochondrial cytochrome c in 15-30 min, caspase-3 activation in 2 h, and apoptosis in 24 h. N-Acetyl cysteine attenuated GSSG elevation and diamide-induced apoptosis. Incubation of cells in 5 mM glucose or inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway maintained GSSG elevation and accelerated cell apoptosis. Collectively, these results show that loss of redox balance is an upstream event that kinetically preceded mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. A sustained redox change was not critical or necessary for apoptotic progression, but its prolongation exacerbated apoptotic death. The potentiation of apoptosis by sustained redox imbalance was correlated with decreases in NADPH supply for GSSG reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2112071381,"Multidrug-resistant tumor cells display enhanced levels of glucosylceramide. In this study, we investigated how this relates to the overall sphingolipid composition of multidrug-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells and which mechanisms are responsible for adapted sphingolipid metabolism. We found in multidrug-resistant cells substantially lower levels of lactosylceramide and gangliosides in sharp contrast to glucosylceramide, galactosylceramide, and sphingomyelin levels. This indicates a block in the glycolipid biosynthetic pathway at the level of lactosylceramide formation, with concomitant accumulation of glucosylceramide. A series of observations exclude regulation at the enzyme level as the underlying mechanism. First, reduced lactosylceramide formation occurred only in intact resistant cells whereas cell-free activity of lactosylceramide synthase was higher compared with the parental cells. Second, the level of lactosylceramide synthase gene expression was equal in both phenotypes. Third, glucosylceramide synthase (mRNA and protein) expression and activity were equal or lower in resistant cells. Based on the kinetics of sphingolipid metabolism, the observation that brefeldin A does not restore lactosylceramide synthesis, and altered localization of lactosylceramide synthase fused to green fluorescent protein, we conclude that lactosylceramide biosynthesis is highly uncoupled from glucosylceramide biosynthesis in the Golgi apparatus of resistant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2107807598,"In sepsis, apoptosis occurs in many different organs. The mediators responsible for induction of apoptosis are not clearly known, although there are some suggestions that C5a and the C5a receptor (C5aR) might be directly linked to apoptosis. In the cecal ligation/puncture (CLP) model of sepsis in rats, apoptosis occurs early in a variety of organs, especially in the thymus. We demonstrate that thymocytes from normal rats show specific, saturable, and high affinity binding of 125I-labeled recombinant rat C5a. C5a binding to thymocytes was significantly increased 3 h after CLP and also when thymocytes from normal rats were first incubated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IL-6. The expression of C5aR mRNA in thymocytes was markedly increased 3, 6, and 12 h after CLP and increased similarly when normal thymocytes were first exposed to LPS or IL-6 in vitro. Thymocytes obtained 2 or 3 h after CLP and exposed in vitro to C5a, but not normal thymocytes, underwent increased apoptosis, as demonstrated by annexin-V binding, coinciding with increased activation of caspases 3, 6, and 8. These data provide the first direct evidence that in the early onset of sepsis, increased expression of C5aR occurs in thymocytes, which increases their susceptibility to C5a-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2126726347,"Because standard culture media for human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) do not contain vitamin C, we hypothesized that HAEC may be under significant oxidative insult compared with the situation in vivo. To assess parameters of oxidative stress, intracellular vitamin C, glutathione (GSH), GSH/GSSG, and NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ ratios, as well as oxidant appearance and oxidative damage, were measured in HAEC with or without vitamin C addition. The effect of vitamin C on eNOS activity was also determined. Results showed that HAEC without vitamin C treatment were essentially scorbutic. On addition of 100 mM vitamin C to the culture media, intracellular vitamin C levels increased and peaked at 6 h. A concomitant increase in the total GSH and the GSH/GSSG ratio was also observed; the NAD(P)H/NAD(P)+ ratio increased more slowly over the 24-h time course. Significantly lower (P <0.05) oxidant appearance and steady-state oxidative damage were also observed following vitamin C repletion. Vitamin C treatment increased eNOS activity by 600%. Thus, HAEC are scorbutic under normal culture conditions and exhibit higher oxidative stress than vitamin C repleted cells. Vitamin C supplementation should be considered when using cultured cells, especially when experimental endpoints are related to cellular redox status and eNOS activity."
https://openalex.org/W2059164315,"In analyzing the molecular mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in neural cells, we observed that dexamethasone, by activating glucocorticoid receptors, causes arrest of HT-22 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; upon withdrawal of the agonist, cells resume proliferation. Our investigations revealed that glucocorticoid treatment, although having no effects on endogenous p53 protein stability, induces rapid translocation of p53 to the nucleus and enhances its transcriptional activity. Consistently, transfection studies with p53-responsive promoters revealed a substantial stimulation of the trans-activation potential of exogenous p53 by dexamethasone. Cells arrested in G1 failed to show signs of apoptosis even after overexpression of p53. Although dexamethasone induced transcription of the proapoptotic gene bax, there was no increase of Bax protein levels. We conclude that glucocorticoid receptor-induced neural cell cycle arrest is associated with an increase in nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of p53, and suggest that potentiation of p53 may serve as a brake on cell proliferation and may prime cells for differentiation or death induced by other signals."

https://openalex.org/W2325943749,"Many types of cancer cells are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis by several mechanisms, including the mutations of the genes involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis. In this study, to explore the possibility that the mutations of the genes involved in the proximal pathway of Fas-mediated apoptosis (Fas, FADD, caspase 8 and caspase 10) are involved in cancer metastasis, we have analysed somatic mutation and deletion of these genes in 80 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with (n=43) and without (n=37) metastasis to the regional lymph nodes. We found 12 mutations (four Fas, four FADD, and four caspase 10 mutations) in 11 of 80 NSCLCs (13.8%). Interestingly, of these mutations, most mutations (10 out of 12) were detected in the NSCLCs with metastasis, and the frequency in the metastasis lesions (23%) was higher than that in the primary lesions of the NSCLCs without metastasis (5.4%). Furthermore, transfection study revealed that the tumor-derived mutants have decreased apoptosis inductions compared to the wild types. These data suggest that the inactivating mutations of the genes in the proximal pathway of Fas-mediated apoptosis may lead to a decreased cancer cell death and play a role in the metastasis of NSCLC."

https://openalex.org/W2313732289,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk9) is a multifunctional kinase with roles in different cellular pathways such as transcriptional elongation, differentiation and apoptosis. Cdk9/cyclin T differs functionally from other cdk/cyclin complexes that regulate cell cycle progression, but maintains structural affinity with those complexes. In addition, previous reports have demonstrated that the cdk9 complex is able to phosphorylate p56/pRb in vitro. In this report we show in vitro and in vivo interaction between cdk9/cyclinT2 and the protein product of the retinoblastoma gene (pRb) in human cell lines. The interaction involves the region composed of residues 129-195 of cdk9, cyclinT2 (1-642 aa) and the C-terminal domain of pRb (835-928 aa). We located the minimal region of cdk9 phosphorylation on the C-terminus of pRb, by identifying the residues between 793 and 834. This region contains at least three proline-directed serines (sp), S795, S807 and S811, which have been reported to be phosphorylated in vivo and which could be targeted by the cdk9 complex. These data suggest that, in logarithmically growing cells, cdk9/cyclin T2 and pRb are located in a nuclear multiprotein complex probably involved in transduction of cellular signals to the basal transcription machinery and that one of these signals could be the cdk9 phosphorylation of pRb."
https://openalex.org/W2121968034,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive lethal muscle disease that affects young boys. Dystrophin, absent in DMD and reduced in the milder form Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD), binds to several membrane-associated proteins known as dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs). Once this critical structural link is disrupted, muscle fibers become more vulnerable to mechanical and osmotic stress. Recently, we have reported that the expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water-selective channel expressed in the sarcolemma of fast-twitch fibers and astrocyte end-feet, is drastically reduced in the muscle and brain of the mdx mouse, the animal model of DMD. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of AQP4 in several DMD/BMD patients of different ages with different mutations in the dystrophin gene. Immunofluorescence results indicate that, compared with healthy control children, AQP4 is reduced severely in all the DMD muscular biopsies analyzed and in 50% of the analyzed BMD. Western blot analysis revealed that the deficiency in sarcolemma AQP4 staining is due to a reduction in total AQP4 muscle protein content rather than to changes in immunoreactivity. Double-immunostaining experiments indicate that AQP4 reduction is independent of changes in the fiber myosin heavy chain composition. AQP4 and a-syntrophin analysis of BMD muscular biopsies revealed that the expression and stability of AQP4 in the sarcolemma does not always decrease when a-syntrophin is strongly reduced. Finally, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy biopsies and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy revealed that AQP4 expression was not altered in these forms of muscular dystrophy. These experiments provide the first evidence of AQP4 reduction in a human pathology and show that this deficiency is an important feature of DMD/BMD."
https://openalex.org/W2162401988,"In this study, we have found that dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) plays in vivo an active role in the modulation of the inflammatory response of chronic rhinosinusitis. Human nasal mucosa expresses DPPIV-like immunoreactivity in submucosal seromucus glands, leukocytes, and endothelial cells of blood vessels. DPPIV enzymatic activity in nasal tissue biopsies taken from patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis was correlated inversely with the density of inflammatory cells in the nasal mucosa, and the DPPIV activity rose when chronic rhinosinusitis was treated. By using a pig animal model, we have shown that the intranasal administration of recombinant DPPIV decreased the vasodilatation induced by exogenous substance P (SP), a proinflammatory peptide released by sensory nerves. In contrast, an inhibitor of DPPIV enhanced the vasodilatatory effect at low doses of SP. SP5-11 was 100- to 1000-fold less potent than SP as a vasodilator of the nasal mucosa. The vasodilatatory effect of SP was abolished by a NK1 receptor antagonist. In conclusion, these results suggest a new pathophysiological pathway for rhinitis based on clinical observations in humans, indicating the involvement of an enzyme to modulate non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic substrate that occurred during nasal dysfunctions."
https://openalex.org/W2039009653,"The primordial combinatorial immune recognition repertoire arose in the evolution of jawed vertebrates approximately 450 million years ago as a rapid genetic process independent of antigenic selection. We propose that it encompassed the entire repertoire of innate immunity involving molecules that had evolved over billions of years. The 'antigen-driven' compartment involving invasive pathogens operates in 'real time' showing inducibility and increases in affinity. Individuals within a species differ in their repertoires because of distinct antigenic challenges, genetics, or local environmental effects. The 'homeostatic' compartment that recognizes invariant cell and serum components should be conserved in all individuals of a species. The potential to recapitulate the entire recognition spectrum must be regenerated during the formation of new species. Evidence for the capacity of the combinatorial response to encompass the entire preexisting repertoire was obtained in studies of natural human IgG antibodies present in intravenous immunoglobulin. Since essential cellular recognition and regulatory elements are conserved throughout evolution, we propose that the natural antibodies of sharks, the most anciently emerged vertebrates to possess the combinatorial immune response, will resemble those of mammals in showing specificity for the conserved recognition/regulatory molecules. If verified, this hypothesis will establish the fundamental importance of natural antibodies not only in defense, but in regulation and functional homeostasis of the individual."
https://openalex.org/W2097629652,"Protein kinase CK2 is a ubiquitous and pleiotropic Ser/Thr protein kinase involved in cell growth and transformation. Here we report the identification by yeast interaction trap of a CK2 interacting protein, UBC3B, which is highly homologous to the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC3/CDC34. UBC3B complements the yeast cdc34-2 cell cycle arrest mutant in S. cerevisiae and transfers ubiquitin to a target substrate in vitro. UBC3B is specifically phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro and in vivo. We mapped by deletions and site directed mutagenesis the phosphorylation site to a serine residue within the C-terminal domain in position 233 of UBC3B and in the corresponding serine residue of UBC3. Following CK2-dependent phosphorylation both UBC3B and UBC3 bind to the F-box protein beta-TrCP, the substrate recognition subunit of an SCF (Skp1, Cul1, F-box) ubiquitin ligase. Furthermore, we observed that co-transfection of CK2alpha' together with UBC3B, but not with UBC3DeltaC, enhances the degradation of beta-catenin. Taken together these data suggest that CK2-dependent phosphorylation of UBC3 and UBC3B functions by regulating beta-TrCP substrate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2169729300,"The aim of these experiments was to determine the contribution of leukocyte-derived iNOS to total iNOS expression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). By transferring bone marrow between iNOS+/+ and iNOS-/- mice, we created chimeric mice in which iNOS expression was limited to either circulating leukocytes (leukocyte-iNOS mice) or parenchymal cells (parenchyma-iNOS mice). Analysis of congenic markers demonstrated that >95% of thymocytes in chimeric mice were of donor origin. Also, following LPS treatment, iNOS mRNA was detectable in blood from leukocyte-iNOS mice but not parenchyma-iNOS mice. Together these findings indicated that the host marrow had been replaced entirely by donor cells. In the lung, at least 50% of the LPS-induced iNOS mRNA was derived from leukocytes, and immunohistochemical analysis indicated that leukocytes were the main source of iNOS protein. In contrast in the liver, colon, and muscle, iNOS expression was derived predominantly from parenchymal cells. This divergence is potentially explained by the high level of leukocyte recruitment to the lung, relative to the other tissues. Plasma levels of NOS byproducts indicated that parenchymal iNOS was the dominant source of systemic iNOS activity. These findings indicate that in tissues other than the lung, parenchymal cells are the principal source of iNOS during endotoxemia."
https://openalex.org/W2315670997,"The antiproliferative action of 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an endogenous estrogen metabolite is specific for cancer cells and is mediated by the induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis. But the identity of the downstream effectors of apoptotic signaling induced by 2-ME is not known. In the present study, we explored the effect of 2-ME on apoptosis in a panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines. We have identified two categories of pancreatic cancer cell lines, which are either sensitive to 2-ME such as MIA PaCa-2, CFPAC-1, PANC-1, or non-sensitive to 2-ME such as Hs 766T. The results presented here indicated that the cell lines responsive to 2-ME could undergo apoptosis either by G2-M arrest (PANC-1) with Bcl-x(L) phosphorylation or by the accumulation of tetraploid cells in G1-S region (MIA PaCa-2) without Bcl-2/ Bcl-x(L) phosphorylation. Furthermore, 2-ME induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells is mitochondria dependent as evident by the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. 2-ME exposed cells exhibit Bid cleavage that is accompanied by the translocation of Bax into the mitochondria. Also 2-ME could induce phosphorylation of Bcl-x(L) in G2-M arrested cells, thus indicating the involvement of various anti- and pro-apoptotic regulators in the signaling cascade. The dissection of differential response of pancreatic cancer cell lines holds promise for future therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2033607253,"Oxidative stress contributes to the development of early transplant failure. As nitric oxide synthases (NOS) can act as sources of superoxide, we investigated the effect of the NOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) on oxyradical production and early rejection in a rat kidney transplantation model. Allograft transplantation (Brown Norway to Lewis) showed more renal superoxide production and monocyte infiltration when compared with isografts (Lewis to Lewis). Administration of the stable BH4 precursor sepiapterin had no effect on superoxide production in the isografts (51+/-10 vs. 69+/-17 cps/10 mg protein), but led to a marked decrease in superoxide production in the allografts (116+/-11 vs. 60+/-6 cps/10 mg protein; P<0.05) and was accompanied by a reduction in periarterial macrophage infiltration (3.3+/-0.7 vs. 1.3+/-0.3 cells/vessel; P<0.05) and an increase in NO production (78+/-22 vs. 173+/-12 AU/g kidney) (P<0.01). In vitro experiments confirm that iNOS can produce superoxide mainly from the heme domain, whereas BH4 administration can reverse this superoxide production in the presence of adequate anti-oxidant defense. Our findings support the hypothesis that BH4 can be used to modulate the function of the inflammatory iNOS isoform and suggest a potential therapeutic role for sepiapterin in early allograft rejection."

Here, we report the expression of Galpha(olf) in human digestive and urogenital epithelial cells using RT-PCR and Western blot. When the constitutively activated form of Galpha(olf)Q214L (AGalpha(olf)) was stably transfected in canine kidney MDCKts.src and human colonic HCT-8/S11 epithelial cells, it induced cellular invasion in collagen gels. AGalpha(olf)-mediated invasion was abrogated by agonists of platelet activating factor receptors (PAF-R) and protease-activated receptors -1 (PAR-1), pharmacological inhibitors of PI3'-Kinase (wortmannin), protein kinase C (Gö6976 and GF109203X), Rho GTPase (C3T exoenzyme), but was independent of protein kinase A. Accordingly, the invasive phenotype induced by AGalpha(olf) in HCT-8/S11 cells was reversed by the RhoA antagonist RhoD (G26V). Although AGalpha(olf) protected MDCKts.src cells against serum starvation-mediated apoptosis via a Rho-independent pathway, both AGalpha(olf) and Rho inhibition by C3T induced neuroendocrine-like differentiation linked to extensive neurite outgrowth and parathyroid hormone-related protein expression in human prostatic LNCaP-AGalpha(olf) cells. Since prostate tumors with a larger neuroendocrine cell population display increased invasiveness, persistent activation of the G-protein alpha(olf) may exert convergent adverse effects on cellular invasion and survival in solid tumors during the neoplastic progression towards metastasis. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1205498"
https://openalex.org/W1981177806,"Glucocorticoids are known to induce apoptosis in lymphoid cells, and Bcl-2 overexpression can block the apoptosis-inducing action of glucocorticoids. Since phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is implicated in regulating Bcl-2 function, we considered the role of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in protecting lymphoid cells from glucocorticoid-induced cell death. Five stably transfected cell lines of WEHI 7.1 cells expressing either wild-type Bcl-2 or alanine mutants of Bcl-2 at amino acids threonine 56, serine 70, threonine 74, or serine 87 were created. Expression of the mutant Bcl-2 proteins was documented by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Mutation of Bcl-2 on T56 and S87 eliminated the ability of Bcl-2 to inhibit glucocorticoid-induced cell shrinkage, mitochondrial depolarization, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Mutation of T74 only partially impaired the ability of Bcl-2 to block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis whereas mutation of S70 in Bcl-2 did not alter its ability to block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis."

Mutant (but not wild-type) SV40 T-Ag show stable, ATP-dependent binding to the stress protein hsp73 when expressed in cells from different vertebrate tissues. Intracellular T/hsp73 complexes accumulate to high steady-state levels. From this observation, we designed a vector system that supports stable expression of a large variety of hsp73-capturing, chimeric antigens containing an N-terminal, T-Ag-derived domain, and different C-terminal antigenic domains from unrelated antigens. Most antigenic domains tested could be stably expressed only in eukaryotic cells as fusion protein/hsp73 complexes. The N-terminal 77 residues representing the J domain of T-Ag were required for stable hsp73 binding and efficient expression of chimeric antigens. Hsp73-bound chimeric antigens expressed by DNA vaccines showed strikingly enhanced immunogenicity evident in humoral (antibody) and cellular cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) responses. The described system supports efficient expression of chimeric, polyvalent antigens and their codelivery with hsp73 as a ""natural adjuvant"" for enhanced immunogenicity for T and B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2097817702,"Regulatory interactions between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria in the control of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]I), may be of importance in the control of many cell functions, and particularly those involved in initiating cell death. We used targeted Ca2+ sensors (cameleons) to investigate the movement of Ca2+ between the ER and mitochondria of intact cells and focused on the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in this interaction. We hypothesized that release of Ca2+ from mitochondria in response to a known MPT agonist (atractyloside) would cause release of ER Ca2+, perpetuating cellular Ca2+ overload, and cell death. Targeted cameleons (mitochondria and ER) were imaged with confocal microscopy 2-3 days following transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Opening of the MPT resulted in specific loss of mitochondrial Ca2+ (blocked by cyclosporin A), which was sequestered initially by ER. The ER subsequently released this Ca2+ load, leading to a global Ca2+ elevation, a response that was not observed when ER Ca2+-ATPases were blocked with cyclopiazonic acid. Thus, ER plays an important role in moderating changes in intracellular Ca2+ following MPT and may play a key role in cell death initiated by mitochondrial mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2140486593,"Dystrophin and its associated proteins, the sarcoglycans, are normally expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. Mutations that alter the expression of these membrane-associated proteins lead to muscular dystrophy (MD) and cardiomyopathy in humans. Because of the timing and nature of the accompanying cardiomyopathy, it has been suggested that cardiomyopathy develops as a secondary consequence of skeletal muscle dysfunction in the muscular dystrophies. To determine whether skeletal muscle dystrophy contributes to the development of sarcoglycan-mediated cardiomyopathy, we used mice lacking gamma-sarcoglycan and inserted a transgene that ""rescued"" gamma-sarcoglycan expression only in skeletal muscle. Gamma-sarcoglycan was expressed in skeletal muscle under the control of the skeletal muscle-specific myosin light chain 1/3 promoter. Gamma-sarcoglycan-null mice expressing this transgene fully restore gamma-sarcoglycan expression. Furthermore, the transgene-rescued mice lack the focal necrosis and membrane permeability defects that are a hallmark of MD. Despite correction of the skeletal muscle disease, focal degeneration and membrane permeability abnormalities persisted in cardiac muscle, and notably persisted in the right ventricle. Therefore, heart and skeletal muscle defects are independent processes in sarcoglycan-mediated muscular dystrophies and, as such, therapy should target both skeletal and cardiac muscle correction to prevent sudden death due to cardiomyopathy in the muscular dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W2317773492,"Nectin is an immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule that comprises a family consisting of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4. Nectin is associated with the actin cytoskeleton through afadin, a nectin- and actin filament-binding protein. The nectin-afadin and cadherin-catenin systems are associated with each other and cooperatively form cell-cell adherens junctions in intact epithelial cells. HSC-39 cells, a human signet ring cell gastric cancer cell line, express E-cadherin but do not form cell-cell adhesion. The beta-catenin gene has been shown to be truncated at the N-terminal region including the alpha-catenin-binding domain in HSC-39 cells, but overexpression of normal beta-catenin failed to form cell-cell adhesion. HSC-39 cells expressed nectin-1, -2, and afadin, but not nectin-3. Overexpression of nectin-3 or -2 formed cell-cell adhesion and accumulation of E-cadherin, but not actin filaments, at the cell-cell adhesion sites. Overexpression of a truncated form of nectin-2 incapable of interacting with afadin failed to form cell-cell adhesion. However, the nectin-formed cell-cell adhesion was not so strong as that observed in epithelial cells, such as CaCo-2 cells. Co-expression of nectin-2 and normal beta-catenin did not form strong cell-cell adhesion. These results suggest that an unidentified mechanism, by which nectin and E-cadherin form the actin cytoskeleton-associated adherens junctions to form strong cell-cell adhesion, is impaired in HSC-39 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2313128361,"It is generally accepted that Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) latent genes EBNA-2, EBNA-3A, -3C, EBNA-LP and LMP1 are essential for growth transformation and immortalization of B lymphocytes. Among these genes, LMP1 plays a key role in the survival and dissemination of the infected B cells by inducing anti-apoptotic genes and surface expression of several activation antigens and adhesion molecules. We have previously shown that antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed to LMP1 mRNA, effectively suppress LMP1 gene expression and substantially reduce B95.8 cell proliferation. In this study, we have used antisense LMP1 oligomers to investigate whether LMP1 suppression might influence the expression of latent EBV genes with oncogenic potential, anti-apoptotic genes, or affect the phenotype of EBV-infected B95.8 cells. Our data show that LMP1 suppression does not affect the transcription of EBNA-2, EBNA-3A, -3B and -3C genes, or that of bcl-2 and mcl-1 anti-apoptotic genes. In contrast, consistent modifications in the expression of CD39, CD54, CD23, CD11 and CD10 molecules were observed in B95.8 cells after treatment with antisense LMP1. Our findings support the possibility for using LMP1 antisense oligomers as therapeutics in EBV-associated tumors."
