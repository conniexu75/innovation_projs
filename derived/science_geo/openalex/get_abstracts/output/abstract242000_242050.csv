https://openalex.org/W2165884167,Accelerated osteoclastic bone resorption has a central role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and other bone diseases. Identifying the molecular pathways that regulate osteoclast activity provides a key to understanding the causes of these diseases and to the development of new treatments. Here we show that mice with inactivation of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors have increased bone mass and are protected from ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Pharmacological antagonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo and caused osteoclast inhibition in vitro by promoting osteoclast apoptosis and inhibiting production of several osteoclast survival factors. These studies show that the CB1 receptor has a role in the regulation of bone mass and ovariectomy-induced bone loss and that CB1- and CB2-selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists are a new class of osteoclast inhibitors that may be of value in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2020988957,"Translocation of monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 to the plasma membrane requires CD147 (basigin) with which they remain tightly associated. However, the importance of CD147 for MCT activity is unclear. MCT1 and MCT4 are both inhibited by the cell-impermeant organomercurial reagent p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS). Here we demonstrate by site-directed mutagenesis that removal of all accessible cysteine residues on MCT4 does not prevent this inhibition. pCMBS treatment of cells abolished co-immunoprecipitation of MCT1 and MCT4 with CD147 and enhanced labeling of CD147 with a biotinylated-thiol reagent. This suggested that CD147 might be the target of pCMBS, and further evidence for this was obtained by treatment of cells with the bifunctional organomercurial reagent fluorescein dimercury acetate that caused oligomerization of CD147. Site-directed mutagenesis of CD147 implicated the disulfide bridge in the Ig-like C2 domain of CD147 as the target of pCMBS attack. MCT2, which is pCMBS-insensitive, was found to co-immunoprecipitate with gp70 rather than CD147. The interaction between gp70 and MCT2 was confirmed using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the cyan fluorescent protein- and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged MCT2 and gp70. pCMBS strongly inhibited lactate transport into rabbit erythrocytes, where MCT1 interacts with CD147, but not into rat erythrocytes where it interacts with gp70. These data imply that inhibition of MCT1 and MCT4 activity by pCMBS is mediated through its binding to CD147, whereas MCT2, which associates with gp70, is insensitive to pCMBS. We conclude that ancillary proteins are required to maintain the catalytic activity of MCTs as well as for their translocation to the plasma membrane.

Transport of lactic acid across the plasma membrane is of fundamental importance for all mammalian cells. Glycolytic cells, such as white muscle fibers, lymphocytes, and other cells under hypoxic conditions, must rapidly export lactic acid, whereas in other tissues rapid import of lactic acid is required to fuel respiration (brain, heart, and red muscle) and gluconeogenesis (liver and kidney) (1Halestrap A.P.

Transport is mediated by a family of proton-linked monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) 1The abbreviations used are: MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; BCECF, 2′-7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5-6-carboxyfluorescein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CD147cYFP, CD147 tagged on the C terminus with yellow variant of green fluorescent protein; CD147nYFP, CD147 tagged on the N terminus with yellow variant of green fluorescent protein; CHC, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; FDMA, fluorescein dimercury acetate; MCT1cCFP, MCT1 tagged on the C terminus with cyan variant of green fluorescent protein; pCMBS, p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate; TM, transmembrane domain; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PEO, polyethylene oxide-iodoacetyl biotin. that are also responsible for the transport of other metabolically important monocarboxylates, including the ketone bodies. The MCT family has fourteen members (3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), six of which have been functionally characterized but only MCT1-MCT4 shown to catalyze proton-coupled transport of lactate (1Halestrap A.P.

MCT8 (also known as XPCT) and MCT10 (also known as TAT1) catalyze the sodium-independent transport of thyroid hormone and aromatic amino acids, respectively (8Friesema E.C.H. Ganguly S. Abdalla A.

MCT1 has been the most widely studied isoform and is expressed in most cells (1Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). In contrast, MCT4 is expressed strongly only in glycolytic tissues such as “white” muscle where it is responsible for the efflux of lactic acid produced by glycolysis, the major source of ATP in these cells (2Juel C. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 10Wilson M.C. Jackson V.N. Heddle C. Price N.T. Pilegaard H. Juel C. Bonen A. Montgomery I. Hutter O.F. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15920-15926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). All members of the MCT family have 12 transmembrane helical domains (TMs) with their N and C termini and a large loop region between TMs 6 and 7 facing the cytosol (1Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 3Halestrap A.P. Meredith D. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). A powerful inhibitor of both MCT1 and MCT4 is the membrane-impermeant thiol reagent p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS) (7Manning Fox J.E. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 11Kim-Garcia C. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S.

In contrast, MCT2 was shown to be insensitive to inhibition by pCMBS (4Bröer S. Bröer A. Schneider H.P. Stegen C. Halestrap A.P. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that this reagent covalently modifies exofacial thiol groups that are present in MCT1 and MCT4 but absent in MCT2. In this report we have used site-directed mutagenesis to sequentially remove cysteine residues from MCT4, yet the resulting transporters remain sensitive to pCMBS inhibition. CD147 (basigin), is a glycoprotein containing a single transmembrane span that acts as an essential chaperone to take MCTs 1 and 4 to the plasma membrane where the transporter and CD147 remain tightly associated (14Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14624-14628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Whether or not the continued interaction between these proteins is essential for transporter activity is not known, but disruption of this interaction by pCMBS is another potential target for organomercurial inhibition of transport. This is an attractive hypothesis, because MCT2 is pCMBS insensitive and does not interact with CD147. However, MCT2 does appear to require another ancillary protein, as yet unidentified, to be properly expressed at the cell surface (15Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 16Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3666-3672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Here we explore the effects of organomercurials on the interactions between CD147 and MCT1/4. We demonstrate that pCMBS inhibits MCT1 and MCT4 activity by attacking a reactive disulfide bond in the Ig-like C2 domain of CD147 and disrupting its interaction with MCT1 or MCT4. We also identify the ancillary protein with which MCT2 interacts as embigin (gp70), a CD147 homologue with an un-reactive Ig-like V domain in place of the C2 domain (17Guenette R.S. Sridhar S. Herley M. Mooibroek M. Wong P. Tenniswood M. Dev. Genet. 1997; 21: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This provides an explanation for the insensitivity of MCT2 toward inhibition by pCMBS. Our data imply that ancillary proteins are required to maintain the catalytic activity of MCTs as well as for their translocation to the plasma membrane. All reagents were obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless otherwise stated. Fluorescein dimercury acetate (FDMA) was synthesized as described by (18Karush F. Klinman N.R. Marks R. Anal. Biochem. 1964; 9: 100-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). EZ-Link® PEO-Iodoacetyl biotin was from Pierce (Perbio Science UK Ltd., Cramlington, Northumberland, UK). Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit against the C-terminal 16 amino acids of rat MCT1, MCT2, and CD147, and human MCT2 and MCT4 using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides and affinity-purified using the immobilized peptide as described previously (10Wilson M.C. Jackson V.N. Heddle C. Price N.T. Pilegaard H. Juel C. Bonen A. Montgomery I. Hutter O.F. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15920-15926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem.

Polyclonal antibodies were also raised against the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of rat embigin (gp70, amino acids 287-328) and rat MCT2 (amino acids 437-489), respectively, using the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-conjugated proteins as described previously for MCT8 antibodies (8Friesema E.C.H.

The mouse monoclonal antibody RET.PE-2 recognizing rat CD147 (21Finnemann S.C. Marmorstein A.D. Neill J.M. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 2366-2374PubMed Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Neil Barclay (University of Oxford). Anti-rat MCT2 raised in chicken was obtained from Chemicon International. Secondary antibodies for Western blotting were from Amersham Biosciences (anti-rabbit) and Sigma (anti-chicken). Cloning of cDNA Constructs—The coding regions of gp70 and rat MCT2 were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pCI-neo mammalian expression vector (Promega). Human MCT2 was subcloned into the NotI site of the pCI-neo vector. The pCI-neo constructs required to express rat MCT1 and rat CD147 tagged on the N and C termini were produced as described previously (16Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3666-3672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) where details of the nomenclature used may be found. To prepare the pCI-neo constructs required to express CFP- and YFP-tagged rat MCT2 and gp70 coding sequences of rat gp70 and MCT2 were subcloned into pECFP-C1, pECFP-N1, pEYFP-C1, and pEYFP-N1 vectors (Clontech) in the correct reading frame and with removal of the stop codon using PCR. To prepare rat MCT2nCFP, MCT2nYFP, MCT2cCFP, and MCT2cYFP modified constructs, PCR primers containing restriction sites EcoRI (5′) and BamHI (3′) were employed. Rat gp70nCFP, nYFP, cCFP, cYFP were constructed in a similar manner but using EcoRI (5′)- and SalI (3′)-modified primers. PCR products were then digested with the relevant restriction enzyme and inserted into the corresponding sites in the vectors. The resulting constructs where checked by sequencing. For oocyte expression, wild-type and mutant MCT1, MCT4, and CD147 were cloned into the EcoRI site of the vector pGHJ as previously described (7Manning Fox J.E. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, UK), and the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by sequencing. CD147-antisense Experiments in Oocytes—The antisense nucleotide TTCTCATAAATAAAGATTATTGTG was chemically synthesized; this sequence was derived from the consensus sequence of several partial Xenopus CD147 sequences (e.g. CK741473) identified by a BLAST search of the expressed sequence tag data base. The amino acid sequence encoded by this nucleotide sequence is identical to amino acids 228-235 of rat CD147, but the corresponding nucleotide sequence is different in six places. This is important to allow prevention of endogenous CD147 expression without an effect on the expression of exogenous rat CD147. Measurement of Transport—For MCT activity expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the procedure employed was as described previously (7Manning Fox J.E. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). cRNA was prepared by in vitro transcription from the appropriate linearized pGHJ plasmid (mMessage mMachine, Ambion). Oocytes were injected with 25 ng of the relevant cRNA (MCT and CD147) and, where required, 200 ng of CD147 antisense cDNA. Transport was measured 3 days after injection using the ratiometric pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF. Stock solution of pCMBS (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc, Toronto, Canada) were freshly prepared (30 mm in water) and applied at the required concentration 1 min before addition of 30 mm l-lactate to initiate transport. Lactate transport into rat and rabbit erythrocytes was studied by measuring the change in extracellular pH with a pH-sensitive electrode as described previously (22Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were used at 5% hematocrit in lightly buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Hepes, pH 7.0) supplemented with 5 μm DIDS and 100 μm acetazolamide to prevent bicarbonate/CO2-mediated proton movements. Transport was initiated by addition of monocarboxylate at the required concentration, and data were analyzed by first order regression analysis of the time course of pH change. Preparation of Plasma Membrane Fractions—Plasma membrane fractions from rat tissues were prepared as described previously (10Wilson M.C. Jackson V.N. Heddle C. Price N.T. Pilegaard H. Juel C. Bonen A. Montgomery I. Hutter O.F. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15920-15926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). A crude plasma membrane fraction from cultured cells was prepared as follows. Cells were harvested and washed in PBS. The resulting pellet was resuspended in Tris-saline buffer (2.5% (v/v) Tween 40, 0.14 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing proteinase inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), benzamidine (0.5 mm), leupeptin (4 μg/ml), antipain (4 μg/ml), and pepstatin (4 μg/ml)) and incubated with rolling for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were homogenized by passage through a syringe and fine needle and subjected to centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to sediment the plasma membrane fraction that was resuspended in Trissaline buffer without Tween 40 and assayed for protein concentration with Bradford reagent. Plasma membranes from rat and rabbit red blood cells were obtained using a standard erythrocyte ghost preparation (19Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Studies—These were performed essentially as described previously (15Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). RBL.2H3 cells were harvested by scraping, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice in ice-cold PBS. Following resuspension in PBS they were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with the following inhibitors as required: 5 mm CHC, 500 μm pCMBS, and 100 μm DIDS. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with PBS. The pellet was re-suspended in cold lysis buffer (1% (w/v) Brij97, 10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing the proteinase inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), benzamidine (0.5 mm), leupeptin (4 μg/ml), antipain (4 μg/ml), and pepstatin (4 μg/ml). Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C, and then the insoluble fraction removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The lysate was incubated with the appropriate anti-rat CD147 antibody or avidin beads for 2 h (or overnight) at 4 °C. For antibody immunoprecipitations samples were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with Protein A immobilized on Sepharose beads that had been pre-washed in lysis buffer. Avidin or Protein A beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in lysis buffer before re-suspending in sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Following SDS-PAGE, Western blotting was performed as described previously (15Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation of MCT2 and MCT1, kidney membranes (100 μg of protein) were solubilized in lysis buffer as above and incubated with 5 μl of antibodies GST-rMCT2 or GST-rgp70 and 50 μl of monoclonal RET.PE-2 (anti-rat CD147) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was retrieved with immobilized Protein A, washed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described below. Western Blotting—Following SDS-PAGE, Western blotting was performed using polyclonal antibodies against rat MCT1, human MCT4, GST-rat gp70, and rat CD147 at 1 in 1000 (15Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). MCT2 was detected with chicken anti-rat MCT2, 1:5000. Blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL detection kit, Amersham Biosciences) using anti-rabbit or -chicken Ig secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Transfection of COS-7 Cells—COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (from Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), penicillin 100 units/ml, and streptomycin 100 μg/ml (Sigma). For FRET studies (see below), coverslips were placed in 6-well tissue culture plates and seeded with 1-3 × 105 cells per well in 2 ml of complete medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator until they were 60-70% confluent, and then transfection was carried out essentially as described previously (15Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). DNA (2 μg) was mixed with 6 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) in 100 μl of serum-free medium and incubated for 20 min before adding to the cells and incubating for 24 h. At this point the medium was replaced, and live imaging performed after a further 24 h. Live Imaging of Cells and FRET—COS-7 cells were transfected with the following plasmid combinations each containing appropriate CFP and YFP tags on the C and N termini as previously described (above and Ref. 16Wilson M.C. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3666-3672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar): rat gp70 and rat MCT2, rat MCT1 and rat CD147, or rat MCT2 and rat CD147. Where indicated, cells were incubated with 500 μm pCMBS for 5 min or 1 h, before washing off the inhibitor and imaging. This was performed at 37 °C in imaging buffer (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 2 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm NaPi, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) using a Leica confocal imaging spectrophotometer system (TCS-SP2) attached to a Leica DMIRBE inverted epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 430 nm laser, an argon laser (458, 476, 488, and 514 nm lines), and an acousto-optic tunable filter to attenuate individual visible laser lines. Quantification of FRET was performed by calculating the ratio of the fluorescence intensity emission signal at 480 nm to that at 530 nm when excited at the CFP excitation wavelength (430 nm). In all cases a 63 × 1.32 numerical aperture oil immersion objective was employed. MCT4 Cysteine Mutants Remain Sensitive to pCMBS Inhibition—We initially sought to identify an exofacial cysteine residue, present in both MCT1 and MCT4 but not MCT2, that might be the target of pCMBS inhibition. The MCT family is a member of the major facilitator superfamily, and the crystal structures of two members of this family, the Escherichia coli glycerol 3-phosphate transporter and lactose permease, have now been solved (23Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 24Huang Y.F. Lemieux M.J. Song J.M. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). We have used the Cn3D program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3dtut.shtml) to model the MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 structures and so predict more accurately the probable location of all cysteines within the MCTs. The predicted structure of MCT4 is shown in Fig. 1 and suggests that Cys-108, located in the short extracellular loop between TMs 3 and 4, is the only exofacial cysteine residue in MCT4. Furthermore, the equivalent residue in MCT1 is also a cysteine in all species for which sequences are available, whereas MCT2 does not have a cysteine in this position. We mutated this residue to serine (to match MCT2) and expressed the protein in Xenopus oocytes, which contain endogenous CD147 (25Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. 2000; 526P: 23PGoogle Scholar), to measure lactate transport. The mutant was found to remain sensitive to pCMBS when expressed as shown in Fig. 2. Further examination of the sequences revealed another candidate cysteine (Cys-190), located in TM6, that was also present in MCT1 and MCT4 but absent in MCT2. Therefore, although an unlikely target, we generated the double mutant of MCT4, C108S/C190A. For completion we also mutated Cys-191 (present in both MCT1 and MCT2 of all species), Cys-193 (present in neither MCT1 or MCT2 of any species), and Cys-325 (present in neither MCT1 or MCT2 of any species) to alanine. All mutants gave similar rates of transport in the absence of pCMBS (data not presented), but as shown in Fig. 2, their sensitivity toward pCMBS was increased, rather than decreased. This was most notable when Cys-325 was mutated to alanine as in C108S/C190A/C191A/C325A and C108S/C190A/C191A/C193A/C325A. Whatever the reason for this increase in sensitivity (see “Discussion”) it is clear that none of these cysteines is responsible for inhibition of MCT4 transport activity by pCMBS.Fig. 2Removal of cysteine residues in MCT4 does not stop pCMBS inhibiting lactate transport. Wild type and five cysteine mutants of human MCT4 (C108S, C108S/C190A, C108S/C190A/C191A, C108S/C190A/C191A/C325A, and C108S/C190A/C191A/C193A/C325A) were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the rates of uptake of 30 mm l-lactate in the presence of the concentration of pCMBS shown were determined using BCECF fluorescence as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data shown represent the mean ± S.E. of three to five uptake measurements, each on a separate oocyte. The lines drawn are smooth trend lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because there are no other cysteine residues in MCT4 that are present in the equivalent location in MCT1, or are likely to be accessible to the extracellular medium (Fig. 1), two alternative conclusions are possible. First, the cysteine attacked by pCMBS is on a protein other than MCT1 and MCT4, the likely candidate being CD147. Second, although pCMBS is generally used as a cysteine-modifying reagent (because of its mercuric group), its effects might be mediated through the sulfonate groups. This is unlikely because p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and mersalyl are also potent inhibitors of MCT1 (11Kim-Garcia C. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 26Leeks D.R. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. Soc.

However, to confirm this, the non-mercuric compound p-chlorobenzoic sulfonate was substituted for pCMBS but no inhibition of MCT1 or MCT4 expressed in Xenopus oocytes was observed (data not shown). CD147 Is Reactive toward Organomercurials—For pCMBS to bind to CD147, it must react with a cysteine residue on the extracellular (N-terminal) domain of the protein. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of CD147 reveals that there are only four cysteine residues conserved across species. These are thought to be involved in the disulfide bridges of immunoglobulin-like folds. However, such cysteine residues can remain reactive to thiol reagents as has been shown for the Ig-like C2 domain (IPR003598) of CD4 (28Matthias L.J. Yam P.T. Jiang X.M. Vandegraaff N. Li P. Poumbourios P. Donoghue N. Hogg P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The Prosite data base (us.expasy.org/prosite/) also identifies an Ig-like C2 domain between residues 22 and 103 of CD147 that might be reactive toward thiol reagents. Our first evidence that pCMBS might attack CD147 was obtained by cross-linking CD147 with a monoclonal antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody against mouse IgA. Such antibody treatment causes CD147 to coalesce together with MCT1 or MCT4 into caps in Y3 cells (15Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We were able to demonstrate that this capping of CD147, MCT1, and MCT4 was abolished by exposure of Y3 cells to 0.5 mm pCMBS for 5 min (see Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, two other inhibitors of MCT1, 4-4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS) and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC), were without effect. These data imply that following pCMBS treatment the conformation of CD147 changes such that the antibodies cannot bind. This is strongly suggestive of a direct interaction of pCMBS with CD147. This conclusion was confirmed directly by the series of experiments described below. We anticipated that fluorescein dimercury acetate (FDMA) would fluorescently label CD147 and allow its detection in an immunoprecipitate. Initially, rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL.2H3) were used for these studies, because we had previously demonstrated substantial co-immunoprecipitation of MCT1 with CD147 in such cells (15Kirk P.

Period genes are themselves Clock targets, thereby establishing a negative transcriptional feedback circuit controlling circadian periodicity. Previous data have implicated the CK1ϵ isolog Doubletime (Dbt) and the F-box protein Slimb in the regulation of Drosophila Period (Per) through an unknown mechanism. In this work, we have identified components of the machinery involved in regulating the abundance of human Per1 in tissue culture cells. CK1ϵ and CK1γ2 were found to bind to Per1 and to promote its degradation in an in vivo degradation assay. Per1 turnover was blocked by a dominant negative version of the Cul1 protein, a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase. We screened a panel of F-box proteins for those that would associate with Per1 in a CK1ϵ-dependent manner, and we identified β-TRCP1 and β-TRCP2, isologs of the Drosophila Slimb protein. RNA interference against β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TRCP) stabilizes endogenous and exogenous Per1. β-TRCP associates with sequences near the N terminus of Per1 in a region distinct from the previously characterized CK1ϵ-binding site. β-TRCP and CK1ϵ promote Per1 ubiquitination in vitro. Finally, RNA interference against β-TRCP greatly decreases Clock-dependent gene expression in tissue culture cells, indicating that β-TRCP controls endogenous Per1 activity and the circadian clock by directly targeting Per1 for degradation.

The circadian clock is an endogenous oscillator that controls behavior and physiology of organisms ranging from Neurospora to mammals. In most cases, this oscillator is linked to dark-light cycles (1Panda S. Hogenesch J.B. Kay S.A. Nature. 2002; 417: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 2Hastings M.H. Herzog E.D. J.

The central mechanism underlying circadian clocks is a cell autonomous autoregulatory transcriptional feedback loop. In Drosophila, two basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, Cycle (Cyc) and Clock (Clk), form a heterodimeric complex that binds to E-box promoter sequences to activate the expression of a variety of genes important for establishing circadian clock output (5McDonald M.J.

In response to appropriate signals, newly synthesized Per and possibly Per-Tim complexes translocate to the nucleus where Per functions to repress the Cyc-Clk complex and inhibit transcription. Thus, interaction between Clk/Cyc and Per forms the basis of a transcriptional feedback loop (2Hastings M.H. Herzog E.D. J. Biol.

In mammals, the components of the system are structurally related, but the gene families are often expanded. Clock interacts with the Bmal-1 transcription factor to form a complex analogous to Cyc/Clk. However, there are three Per-related genes in mammals (PER1, PER2, and PER3). The available data indicate that Per1 and Per2 play primary roles in circadian rhythms (14Sangoram A.M. Saez L. Antoch M.P. Gekakis N. Staknis D. Whiteley A. Fruechte E.M. Vitaterna M.H. Shimomura K.

In addition, two distinct Cry genes are present in mammals (18van der Horst G.T. Muijtjens M. Kobayashi K. Takano R. Kanno S. Takao M. de Wit J. Verkerk A. Eker A.P. van Leenen D. Buijs R. Bootsma D.

Cry proteins also interact with the Clk-Bmal-1 complex and may repress this complex independently of Period and Timeless (17Shearman L.P. Sriram S. Weaver D.R. Maywood E.S. Chaves I. Zheng B. Kume K. Lee C.C. van der Horst G.T. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M. Science. 2000; 288: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Thus, the potential to form multiple temporally distinct higher order complexes exists. Post-translational regulation of Per also plays an important role in establishing the circadian clock. Indeed, in flies constitutive expression of Per in per01 (per null) flies restores behavioral rhythms (21Shigeyoshi Y. Meyer-Bernstein E. Yagita K. Fu W. Chen Y. Takumi T. Schotland P. Sehgal A. Okamura H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that the major mechanisms controlling periodicity involves post-translational mechanisms. The mechanisms appear to control both the activity status of Per as well as its stability, and regulated proteolysis may underlie the periodic control of clock-dependent gene expression by relieving the repressive activity of Period. Two protein kinases, Doubletime (Dbt) and casein kinase II (CKII), have been implicated in the regulation of Per in Drosophila (22Ko H.W. Jiang J. Edery I. Nature. 2002; 420: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 23Lin J.M. Kilman V.L. Keegan K. Paddock B. Emery-Le M. Rosbash M. Allada R. Nature. 2002; 420: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In addition, Shaggy/GSK3 has been implicated in the control of Tim translocation into the nucleus and may regulate Per indirectly (24Martinek S. Inonog S. Manoukian A.S. Young M.W. Cell. 2001; 105: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar).

Nature. 2002; 420: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Although CK1ϵ has been proposed to control nuclear translocation of Per1 in mammalian systems (27Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), recent data in Drosophila suggest that this may be an indirect effect of tight interaction of phosphorylated Per with chromatin (12Nawathean P. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13 (and references therein): 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, CKIϵ is also thought to promote degradation of Per both in Drosophila and mammals through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (28Akashi M. Tsuchiya Y. Yoshino T. Nishida E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 29Lee C. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Turnover of proteins through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway involves three major activities as follows: E1 ubiquitin-activating protein that uses ATP to form a high energy thiol ester with the C terminus of ubiquitin; an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that receives ubiquitin from E1 and transfers it to lysine residues in the substrate; and E3 ubiquitin ligase that serves to bind both the E2 and the substrate, thereby facilitating transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate (reviewed in Ref. 30Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Multiple rounds of ubiquitination on the initial ubiquitin conjugate lead to formation of a polyubiquitin chain that is recognized by the proteasome, resulting in degradation of the ubiquitinated protein. One of the best understood E3s is the SCF ubiquitin ligase (31Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). These complexes are composed of Cul1, which serves as a scaffold for assembly of ubiquitin conjugation and substrate-binding components (reviewed in Refs. 33Ang X.L. Harper J.W.

The C terminus of Cul1 binds to the Rbx1 Ring finger protein (also called Roc1), which in turn binds to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (35Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N. Skowyra D.

Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11 (and references therein): 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). However, both Drosophila and mammalian Period proteins lack this sequence, bringing into question whether the interaction is direct. Moreover, SLMB has not been shown to directly ubiquitinate Per in vitro. In this study, we have examined the role of phosphorylation and the ubiquitin machinery in the degradation of mammalian Per1 in tissue culture cells. Systematic examination of 10 CK1 family members indicates that CK1ϵ and CK1γ2 can promote proteasome-dependent Per1 degradation in mammalian tissue culture cells, and their removal by RNAi leads to an increased abundance of Per1. As expected, CK1ϵ interacted with Per1 in transfected cells, as did CK1γ2. We found that dominant negative Cul1 (but not Cul3) stabilized Per1, suggesting an F-box-mediated degradation pathway. We surveyed two dozen F-box proteins for CK1ϵ-dependent binding to Per1 and identified β-TRCP1 and β-TRCP2 as phosphorylation-dependent binding proteins for Per1. Simultaneous knock-down of β-TRCP1 and β-TRCP2 leads to stabilization of Per1. Interaction of β-TRCP with Per1 involves sequences located near the N terminus of the protein in a region distinct from the previously characterized CK1ϵ binding domain (28Akashi M. Tsuchiya Y. Yoshino T. Nishida E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 29Lee C. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of Per1 in vitro by SCFβ-TRCP required that Per1 be previously phosphorylated with CK1ϵ, and CKII was not effective in promoting Per1 ubiquitination in this setting. Finally, overexpression of β-TRCP and CK1ϵ resulted in stimulation of Clock/Bmal-1-dependent gene transcription as assessed by using an E-box reporter construct, whereas knock-down of β-TRCP resulted in a dramatic decrease in Clock/Bmal-1-dependent transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that SCFβ-TRCP collaborates with CK1ϵ to promote turnover of Per1 in mammalian cells, thereby controlling the activity of the Clock transcription factor complex. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, the cells were incubated for 48 h and harvested. For the knock-down by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), dual transfections were performed as described previously (50Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3062-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were cultured in INSECT-EXPRESS medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Bac-N-Blue constructs expressing FLAG-CKIϵ were transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin (Invitrogen). DNA Constructs—Human PER1 gene and casein kinase genes were generated by PCR and cloned into pENTR-D (Invitrogen). For expression, pENTR constructs were recombined using Clonase (Invitrogen) with the indicated epitope-tagged vectors for mammalian expression or Bac-N-Blue vectors for expression in insect cells. Open reading frames for the indicated F-box proteins (50Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3062-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and CK1 isoforms (produced by PCR from full-length EST clones) were ligated into pENTR6 and subsequently recombined into pDEST-CMV-GST, pCMV-GFP, or pCMV-Myc vectors. Mutants of Per1 (5SA or FA) or CKIϵ (K38R) were generated by PCR and verified by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The indicated cells were lysed in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). In some experiments, cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) was added before harvesting cells. In some experiments, MG132 was added at the indicated concentrations (1.0 or 2.0 μm) 15 h before lysis. Extracts were subjected to direct Western blot analysis or immunoaffinity purification using indicated affinity reagent. Anti-GST (Z-5) and anti-Myc (9E10) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma. Anti-Cul1, anti-CDC25A, and anti-Per1 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc., Neomarker, and Affinity BioReagents, respectively. Anti-TRCP was from a previous study and has been shown to interact with both β-TRCP1 and β-TRCP2 (53Spiegelman V.S. Tang W. Katoh M. Slaga T.J. Fuchs S.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To verify the knock-down of β-TRCP, phosphorylated β-catenin beads were used to concentrate the amount of β-TRCP prior to immunoblotting as described previously (50Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3062-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Reactions and in Vitro Ubiquitination Reactions— Sf9 cells infected with FLAG-tagged CKIϵ were lysed in NETN buffer and purified by FLAG M2 beads (Sigma). CKIϵ protein was eluted using FLAG M2 peptide (Sigma). 35S-Labeled and in vitro translated Per1 was incubated with purified CKIϵ (100 ng) or CKII (Biolabs) at 37 °C for 30 min. Per1 proteins were separated by 4–12% Tris glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gradient mini gels (Invitrogen) prior to autoradiography. Per1 ubiquitination was performed using phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated in vitro translated Per1 (2.5 μl) in the presence of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (50 ng), Ubc5 (200 ng), ubiquitin (1 mg/ml), 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde (Boston Biochem), 2.3 μl of in vitro translated β-TRCP, and 4 mm ATP in a total volume of 10 μl (50 min, 27 °C). SDS-PAGE separation was performed by 3–8% Tris acetate gradient mini gels (Invitrogen) prior to autoradiography. Luciferase Reporter Assays—HEK293T cells were plated in 12-well dishes 12 h before transfection. Cells in each well were transfected with 20 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (either 54-mer E-box-Luc or 4R-Luc, both were gifts from Dr. S. Reppert, University of Massachusetts Medical School), 5 ng of SV40 Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid and the indicated amount of expression or shRNA plasmids for β-TRCP or Fbw7. Dual transfection was performed for the shRNA plasmids as described previously (50Jin J. Shirogane T. Xu L. Nalepa G. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3062-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA in each well was adjusted by adding pHR-myc expression plasmid as carrier. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed prior to determination of luciferase activity by luminometry. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized by determining the firefly/Renilla activity ratio from triplicate wells. All experiments were repeated at least twice. Systematic Analysis of the Role of Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) Isoforms in the Control of Per1 Degradation—Previous studies indicate a role for casein kinase 1ϵ (CK1ϵ) in control of Per1 turnover. However, the possible role of other CK1 isoforms has not been systematically examined. The CK1 family contains 10 family members, including α, δ, ϵ, and γ and the vaccinia virus-related kinases (VRK) 1–3 (Fig. 1A). These kinases contain highly conserved catalytic domains but have unrelated C-terminal extensions. In order to examine the potential of each CK1 protein to promote Per1 turnover, we developed an in vivo degradation assay. GST-Per1 and various CK1 proteins were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. In control experiments lacking CK1 or in the presence of CK1 α1, α2, δ, γ1, γ3, VRK1, VRK2, or VRK3, GST-Per1 accumulated to high levels (Fig. 1B). In contrast, co-expression of Per1 with CK1ϵ or -γ2 resulted in little or no accumulation of GST-Per1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 7). Importantly, addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 led to accumulation of GST-Per1 in the presence of either CK1ϵ or -γ2 (Fig. 1C), indicating that the loss of GST-Per1 in this setting was proteasome-dependent. All CK1 proteins, when purified from transfected mammalian cells, displayed similar levels of activity toward the generic substrate casein and also displayed autophosphorylation activity (data not shown), indicating that the absence of activity in Per1 degradation was not a simple reflection of the absence of catalytic activity. Previous studies have indicated that CK1ϵ can form stable complexes with Per1 (20Lee C. Etchegaray J.P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M.

The finding that CK1γ2 can promote Per1 degradation led us to ask whether CK1γ2 might also form a complex with Per1. GST-Per1 or GST as a negative control was co-expressed with all 10 CK1 isoforms tagged with an N-terminal c-Myc epitope in HEK293 cells, and GST-Per1 and associated proteins were purified by using GSH-Sepharose (Fig. 1D). As expected, CK1ϵ stably associated with GST-Per1 (Fig. 1D, lane 10) but not with GST alone (lane 9). We also found that CK1γ2 formed stable complexes with GST-Per1 (Fig. 1D, lane 14). In contrast, none of the other CK1 isoforms were found to associate with GST-Per1 (Fig. 1D), indicating a high degree of selectivity for the interaction with CK1ϵ and -γ2. We then examined the effect of depletion of CK1ϵ and CK1γ2 by RNAi of"

The ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 plays a pivotal role in stimulating p53 turnover. However, recently additional ubiquitin ligases have been identified that participate in the degradation of the tumor suppressor. Apparently, multiple degradation pathways are employed to ensure proper destruction of p53. Here we show that the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase CHIP is able to induce the proteasomal degradation of p53.

Our data reveal that mutant and wild-type p53 transiently associate with molecular chaperones and can be diverted onto a degradation pathway through this association. The p53 tumor suppressor has been termed “the guardian of the genome” (1Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4402) Google Scholar). In normal cells p53 is present at low concentration. DNA damage and other stresses such as hypoxia cause an accumulation of p53, which leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar, 3Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). p53 acts as a transcription factor to activate target genes that are involved in these responses to prevent damaged cells from proliferating and passing mutations on to the next generation (4Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). Cells that lack functional p53 are unable to respond appropriately to stress and are prone to oncogenic transformation. In fact, missense mutations that inactivate p53 are found in ∼50% of all human tumors making them the most frequent genetic alterations in cancer (5Hainaut P. Hollstein M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 81-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 6Woods Y.L. Lane D.P. Hematol. J. 2003; 4: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). p53 is regulated through a variety of posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and attachment of ubiquitin, the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO and the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 (4Vogelstein B.

Central to the regulation of p53 is the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 (8Harper J.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 2-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Freedman D.A. Wu L. Levine A.J.

Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 10: 1073-1081Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Mdm2 belongs to the RING finger E3s, which facilitate ubiquitylation by tethering the E2-ubiquitin complex to the substrate protein (12Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Mdm2-mediated ubiquitylation targets p53 for degradation by the 26 S proteasome and is of central importance for establishing low p53 levels in normal cells (13Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar, 14Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar). The functional interplay between Mdm2 and p53 was elegantly demonstrated in gene knock-out studies, in which the embryonic lethality of mdm2 null mice was rescued by simultaneous deletion of the p53 gene (15Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 16Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Stress-induced phosphorylation of p53 attenuates the interaction with Mdm2, leading to stabilization and activation of the transcription factor (17Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Mdm2 is itself a transcriptional target of p53, which establishes a negative feedback loop to terminate p53-mediated stress responses (18Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Additional mechanisms that regulate the Mdm2-p53 interplay include autoubiquitylation of Mdm2, the association of Mdm2 with diverse binding partners, and alterations of the intracellular localization of Mdm2 and p53 (8Harper J.W. Cell. 2004; 118: 2-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 19Linares L.K. Hengstermann A. Ciechanover A. Müller S. Scheffner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2004; 117: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mdm2 not only mediates ubiquitylation of p53 but can also conjugate Nedd8 to the tumor suppressor to inactivate its transcriptional activity (7Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 83-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Despite the central role of Mdm2 in proteasomal targeting of p53, additional ubiquitin ligases were recently shown to participate in the degradation of the tumor suppressor in normal cells, including p300, Pirh2, and COP1 (21Grossman S.R.

Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K. Koeppen H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 429: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Although p300 seems to cooperate with Mdm2 during ubiquitylation, Pirh2 and COP1 trigger the destruction of p53 independent of Mdm2. Multiple degradation pathways apparently exist to maintain low levels of p53 in normal cells. It is unclear whether these degradation pathways are truly redundant or whether they are selectively engaged in p53 destruction dependent on cell lineage, developmental stage, or physiological situation. In any case, the complexity of p53 degradation may allow to integrate diverse signaling events through which p53 can be regulated. We have recently identified a pathway for protein degradation in the mammalian cytoplasm and nucleus that involves a close cooperation of the molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (24Esser C. Alberti S. Höhfeld J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Of central importance on this degradation pathway is the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase CHIP (25Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Through binding to the carboxyl termini of Hsc70 and Hsp90, CHIP mediates the ubiquitylation of chaperone-bound client proteins in conjunction with E2 enzymes of the Ubc4/5 family and induces client degradation by the 26 S proteasome (26Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Höhfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 27Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K.

Affected chaperone clients can be broadly divided into two subclasses: (i) Hsc70- and Hsp90-associated signaling proteins, for example the glucocorticoid hormone receptor (26Demand J. Alberti S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the full range of cellular substrates of CHIP remains to be explored. Remarkably, mice that lack CHIP develop apoptosis in multiple organs after environmental challenge (35Dai Q. Zhang C. Wu Y. McDonough H. Whaley R.A. Godfrey V. Li H.H. Madamanchi N. Xu W. Neckers L. Cyr D. Patterson C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5446-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This seems to reflect the role of CHIP in the conformational regulation of the heat shock transcription factor but may also mirror altered associations between the chaperone machinery and diverse apoptosis regulators in the absence of CHIP (36Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Many transforming mutants of p53 display structural defects and were previously found associated with the molecular chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 in tissue culture cells and in human tumor specimens (37Davidoff A.M.

For example, Arg175 mutations destabilize loop regions within the DNA binding domain, leading to partial unfolding and association with Hsc70 (40Hinds P.W. Finlay C.A. Quartin R.S. Baker S.J.

Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). In contrast to the findings for mutant p53, an interaction of wild-type p53 with molecular chaperones could not be detected by coimmunoprecipitation (39Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 45Finlay C.A. Hinds P.W. Tan T.H. Eliyahu D. Oren M. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). However, this does not exclude that the extended chaperone interactions observed for mutant p53 actually represent a pathological exaggeration of transient interactions between wild-type p53 and the cellular chaperone machinery, similar to observations made for other signaling proteins (46Xu Y. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 47Cheung J. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Wild-type p53 possesses an intrinsic conformational lability (48Milner J. Watson J.V.

Such associations may modulate the presentation of p53 for degradation and could serve as sensors of cell stress. Here we show that wild-type p53 and an Arg175 mutant form of the tumor suppressor (p53R175H) can be targeted for proteasomal degradation by the CHIP ubiquitin ligase. Our data thus reveal a novel degradation pathway for the tumor suppressor that is entered through a transient association of wild-type and mutant p53 with molecular chaperones. Purified Proteins and Antibodies—The following proteins were expressed recombinantly and purified as described previously: rat Hsc70, human Hsp40, human UbcH5b, human CHIP, and wheat E1 (26Demand J.

Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) were used. Cell Culture and Transfection—H1299 cells were grown in RPMI media (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Transfection of H1299 cells was performed using DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For transfection of U2OS cells Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h post-transfection. Degradation Assays—To analyze the degradation kinetics of p53, H1299 cells were seeded in six-well plates and were transfected with 0.1 μg of pRC/CMV-p53wt or 0.1 μg of pcDNA3.1-p53R175H and 1.2 μg of pcDNA3.1-CHIP as indicated. The total amount of added DNA was kept constant at 2.5 μg/well by the addition of pcDNA3.1. Protein lysates were prepared at indicated time points after addition of cycloheximide (60 μg/ml). Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as a soluble extract. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. Levels of p53 and p53R175H were determined by immunoblotting and quantified at indicated time points. To analyze the effect of geldanamycin on the degradation of p53, H1299 cells were treated with geldanamycin (1 μm) and dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively, 12 h after transfection. In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—In vitro transcription of p53 and p53R175H was performed with pRC/CMV-p53wt and pcDNA3.1-p53R175H using the T7 RiboMax system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The obtained RNA was used for in vitro translation of radiolabeled p53 and p53R175H with nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). For ubiquitylation of p53 and p53R175H, 8 μl of the translation reactions was incubated with 0.1 μm E1, 4 μm UbcH5b, 6 μm CHIP, 6 μm Hsc70, and 0.6 μm Hsp40 as indicated. Each sample received 2.5 μg/μl ubiquitin, 1 μg/μl ubiquitin-aldehyde, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 10 mm creatine kinase. The total volume of the samples was adjusted to 20 μl with 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Reporter Gene Assays—H1299 cells were seeded in six-well plates and were transfected with 0.6 μg of a firefly luciferase reporter gene plasmid (pp53-TA-Luc; BD Biosciences Clontech), 0.2 μg pRC/CMV-p53wt, and 1.2 μg pcDNA3.1-CHIP as indicated. The total amount of added DNA was kept constant at 2.5 μg/well by addition of pcDNA3.1. U2OS cells were seeded in six-well plates and were transfected with 0.2 μg of ppluc-p53 and increasing amounts of pcDNA3.1-CHIP from 0 to 0.5 μg as indicated. The total amount of DNA was kept constant at 0.8 μg/well by the addition of pcDNA3.1. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 0.5% Tween 20) containing Complete protease inhibitor. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as a soluble extract. 5 μl of cell extract were analyzed with luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Levels of p53 and CHIP were determined after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. RNA Interference—Endogenous CHIP was depleted in U2OS cells using siRNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The oligonucleotide CHIP1 is directed against the sequence GAAGAAGCGCTGGAACAGC, and CHIP2 targets the sequence ACCACGAGGGTGATGAGGA of the human CHIP gene. Green fluorescent protein siRNA (GGCTACGTCCAGGAGCGCACC) served as the control. U2OS cells were seeded in six-well plates and were transfected twice at a 72-h interval with siRNA oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 72 h after the second transfection cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as a soluble extract. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. Levels of CHIP and p53 were determined by immunoblotting. p53R175H but Not Wild-type p53 Forms Stable Complexes with Hsc70 in H1299 Cells—To investigate a potential influence of the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase CHIP on the turnover of p53, the human lung cancer cell line H1299 was used. In an initial experiment we analyzed the association of wild-type p53 and the conformational mutant p53R175H with Hsc70 following transient transfection of the p53-deficient cell line with corresponding expression plasmids. Although wild-type p53 was not found in association with Hsc70, complexes between p53R175H and Hsc70 were readily detectable after immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). Transient transfection of H1299 cells thus recapitulates the findings obtained in p53-expressing cell lines and tumor specimens that conformational mutants but not wild-type p53 form stable complexes with molecular chaperones (37Davidoff A.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). p53R175H and Wild-type p53 Can Be Targeted for Degradation by the CHIP Ubiquitin Ligase—As the p53R175H mutant of p53 was found associated with Hsc70, we investigated whether the turnover of the mutant form is affected by CHIP. Upon elevation of the cellular levels of CHIP in H1299 cells a significant decline in the levels of coexpressed p53R175H was observed (Fig. 2A). This decline could be attributed to an accelerated degradation of p53R175H induced by the CHIP ubiquitin ligase (Fig. 2, B and C). Apparently, the oncogenic mutant protein can be turned over by a chaperone-assisted degradation pathway. Despite the fact that complexes between wild-type p53 and Hsc70 were not detectable by immunoprecipitation, it was previously speculated that wild-type p53 may undergo highly transient interactions with molecular chaperones (39Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We reasoned that such transient interactions might become detectable upon CHIP overexpression, when even those proteins that associate with Hsc70 in a highly transient manner would be irreversibly diverted onto a degradation pathway (29Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 31Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M.

Cell. 2004; 15: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In fact, CHIP was able to induce the degradation of wild-type p53, albeit with a slightly reduced efficiency when compared with the findings for p53R175H (Fig. 3). Our data reveal that wild-type p53 associates transiently with molecular chaperones and can be diverted onto a degradation pathway through this association. Geldanamycin Induces the Degradation of Wild-type and Mutant p53 in H1299 Cells—We investigated how the ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin (GA) affects p53 degradation. GA specifically inhibits Hsp90, which usually results in the proteasomal degradation of client proteins that depend on the activity of the chaperone (52Neckers L. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S55-S61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The turnover of wild-type and mutant p53 was stimulated upon GA treatment, consistent with an association of both forms with Hsp90 (Fig. 4). However, only in the case of p53R175H was a synergistic effect of GA treatment and CHIP elevation observed. The prolonged and more stable association of mutant p53 with Hsp90 and Hsc70 may provide the molecular basis for this synergism. CHIP Mediates Ubiquitylation of p53 and p53R175H in Cooperation with UbcH5b and Hsc70—To verify that CHIP acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase during p53 degradation, p53 and p53R175H were in vitro translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Upon addition of purified CHIP to translation reactions, ubiquitylated forms of wild-type and mutant p53 accumulated (Fig. 5). An increase in the amount of ubiquitylated p53 was also observed when UbcH5b and Hsc70 were added, suggesting a close cooperation of CHIP, UbcH5b, and Hsc70 during the ubiquitylation of p53, similar to recent observations for other CHIP substrates (26Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Höhfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 32Alberti S. Böhse K. Arndt V. Schmitz A. Höhfeld J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). CHIP Affects p53-mediated Transcription—We analyzed how CHIP influences p53-mediated transcription using a reporter construct that contains firefly luciferase under the control of a p53-response element. Overexpression of CHIP led to a significant reduction of luciferase activity in corresponding cell extracts (Fig. 6A). Conceivably, such a reduction may be caused by a CHIP-induced degradation of luciferase itself. However, it was previously shown that CHIP does not target luciferase for degradation but stimulates the folding of luciferase in tissue culture cells (53Kampinga H.H. Kanon B. Salomons F.A. Kabakov A.E. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4948-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this regard the observed reduction of luciferase activity rather appears to be an under-estimate of the effect of CHIP on p53-mediated transcription. Notably, the observed reduction in luciferase activity was comparable with the reduction of p53 levels (Fig. 6B). CHIP-induced attenuation of p53-mediated transcription was also observed in U2OS cells that endogenously express p53 (Fig. 6C). It seems that CHIP alters p53-dependent transcriptional responses through an induced degradation of p53. Depletion of Endogenous CHIP Stabilizes p53—Endogenous levels of CHIP were depleted in U2OS cells following transfection with siRNAs (Fig. 7). Intriguingly, depletion of the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase caused a significant increase of p53 levels. The findings emphasize the role of chaperone-assisted degradation in maintaining low concentrations of p53 under physiological conditions. Here we identify a novel degradation pathway for the tumor suppressor p53. This pathway is entered through a transient association of wild-type and mutant p53 with molecular chaperones and involves the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase CHIP. CHIP cooperates with E2 enzymes of the Ubc4/5 family to mediate the attachment of an ubiquitin-derived degradation signal to chaperone-bound p53, which leads to the proteasomal destruction of the tumor suppressor. CHIP-mediated degradation critically depends on the interaction of the ubiquitin ligase with the chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90, which were shown to present chaperone clients to the ubiquitin ligase (26Demand J. Alberti S. Patterson C. Höhfeld J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 29Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J.

Cell. 2004; 15: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has long been appreciated that oncogenic mutant forms of p53 associate with Hsc70 and Hsp90 in tissue culture cells and in tumor specimens (37Davidoff A.M. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3439-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 39Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because of conformational alterations mutant p53s are retained in complexes with the two chaperones and with several of their regulatory cochaperones (39Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 54King F.W. Wawrzynow A. Höhfeld J. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, oncogenic mutants are amenable to a regulation through chaperone-assisted degradation. A similar association with molecular chaperones was not yet unequivocally demonstrated for wild-type p53, as complexes between the tumor suppressor and Hsc70 or Hsp90 could not be isolated (39Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It was speculated, however, that such complexes may escape detection because of their highly transient nature (39Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Such transient associations with Hsc70 or Hsp90 may become detectable when the chaperone client is irreversibly diverted onto a degradation pathway through the action of the CHIP ubiquitin ligase. In fact, we observed that wild-type p53 is sensitive to an elevation of the cellular levels of the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase. Furthermore, depletion of endogenous CHIP stabilized wild-type p53 in U2OS cells. Taken together, our data establish a role of molecular chaperones in the regulation of wild-type p53. Evidence suggests that chaperones associate with p53 at multiple stages and influence the oligomeric state, the nucleocytoplasmic transport and the transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor (reviewed in Refs. 55Zylicz M.

Biol. 2004; 337: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, Hsc70 was shown to sequester a mutant form of p53 in the cytoplasm by masking a nuclear localization signal present at the carboxyl terminus (56Akakura S. Yoshida M. Yoneda Y. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14649-14657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). p53 displays multiple binding sites for Hsc70, located in the amino-terminal transactivation domain, the DNA-binding core domain, and the carboxyl terminus (60Stürzbecher H.W. Addison C. Jenkins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3740-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 61Lam K.T. Calderwood S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Binding sites within the core domain are recognized with particularly high affinity by Hsc70, but they appear to be buried within the native protein. On the other hand, the amino-terminal region of p53 seems to be natively unfolded, and the carboxyl terminus is relatively unstructured (64Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 65Bell S. Klein C. Müller L. Hansen S. Buchner J. J. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 332: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Binding sites within these regions may remain accessible for Hsc70 when the protein is largely in a native conformation. Notably, studies using conformational antibodies indicate that even the core domain is a metastable structure that is easily perturbed upon treatment with chelating or oxidizing agents or by raising the temperature (49Hainaut P. Butcher S. Milner J. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 67Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar). The core domain is also recognized by Hsp90 (57Müller L. Schaupp A. Walerych D. Wegele H. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48846-48854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 68Rüdiger S. Freund S.M. Veprintsev D.B. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48836-48845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that Hsp90 is required to maintain the DNA binding activity of the core domain under physiological conditions. Apparently, p53 is a protein of large conformational flexibility and seems to be in a conformational equilibrium between native and less structured states. This flexibility may provide the means for complex intra- and intermolecular interactions and for the association of p53 with a multitude of regulatory proteins. The accompanying conformational changes are apparently assisted by Hsc70 and Hsp90. In this regard the extended chaperone interactions observed for mutant p53 seem to represent a pathologic exaggeration of physiologic interactions of wild-type p53 with the chaperone machinery. Conceivably, the CHIP-mediated degradation pathway might be entered through an association of a chaperone client with either Hsc70 or Hsp90, as CHIP is able to bind both chaperones. Treatment of tissue culture cells with small molecular inhibitors of Hsp90, such as GA, has helped to verify this hypothesis. Geldanamycin blocks the interaction of Hsp90 with chaperone clients. Remarkably, the Hsp90 inhibitor stimulates the CHIP-mediated degradation of signaling proteins that rely on an association with Hsc70 and Hsp90, i.e. the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (30Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12847-12852Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). GA treatment dissociates Hsp90 while increasing the association of Hsc70 with ErbB2. Redistribution into Hsc70 complexes followed by proteasomal degradation was also observed for oncogenic mutants of p53 upon treatment of tumor cell lines with GA (39Whitesell L. Sutphin P.D. Pulcini E.J. Martinez J.D. Cook P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Here we show that GA-mediated inhibition of Hsp90 induces the degradation of mutant and wild-type p53 in H1299 cells. This provides additional evidence for an association of both forms with molecular chaperones. GA-induced degradation of mutant but not wild-type p53 was further stimulated by the overexpression of CHIP. The highly transient association of wild-type p53 with Hsc70 and Hsp90 may limit the synergistic effects of GA treatment and CHIP overexpression. In any case, the diversion of chaperone clients, including p53, onto a proteasomal degradation pathway seems to be preferentially mediated by an Hsc70/CHIP chaperone machinery. The observation that elevated CHIP levels increase the sensitivity of oncogenic mutant forms of p53 against Hsp90 inhibitors might be of profound relevance for cancer treatment. Several Hsp90-inhibitors are currently tested in clinical trials as anti-tumor agents (52Neckers L. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S55-S61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The expression level of CHIP might be an important determinant of the therapeutic success of such pharmacological interventions. Notably, siRNA-mediated depletion of CHIP significantly stabilized p53. This suggests a critical role of chaperone-assisted degradation in maintaining low concentrations of the tumor suppressor under physiological conditions and points to a novel link between the cellular chaperone machinery and apoptosis regulation. Intriguingly, recent evidence also suggests a cross-talk between CHIP and Mdm2 in p53 regulation (59Burch L. Shimizu H. Smith A. Patterson C. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this cross-talk is provided by the formation of a heterocomplex comprising Mdm2, p53, and Hsp90 (59Burch L. Shimizu H. Smith A. Patterson C. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 69Peng Y. Chen L. Li C. Lu W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the heterocomplex the activity of Mdm2 to ubiquitylate p53 is inhibited by Hsp90 (64Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). At the same time Mdm2 and Hsp90 cooperate to stimulate the unfolding of native p53 tetramers (59Burch L. Shimizu H. Smith A. Patterson C. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to bind Hsp90, CHIP can enter the heterocomplex and then further promote p53 unfolding (59Burch L. Shimizu H. Smith A. Patterson C. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This may represent an initial step in diverting p53 from Mdm2-mediated regulation onto a CHIP-induced degradation pathway. In line with a role of CHIP in apoptosis regulation, an anti-apoptotic activity of CHIP was recently demonstrated based on the analysis of CHIP knock-out mice (35Dai Q. Zhang C. Wu Y. McDonough H. Whaley R.A. Godfrey V. Li H.H. Madamanchi N. Xu W. Neckers L. Cyr D. Patterson C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5446-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although the anti-apoptotic activity was largely attributed to the role of CHIP in the conformational regulation of the heat shock transcription factor, the ability of the chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase to induce p53 degradation may contribute to this activity."

https://openalex.org/W2044219530,"H1 histones bind to DNA as they enter and exit the nucleosome. H1 histones have a tripartite structure consisting of a short N-terminal domain, a highly conserved central globular domain, and a lysine-and arginine-rich C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain comprises approximately half of the total amino acid content of the protein, is essential for the formation of compact chromatin structures, and contains the majority of the amino acid variations that define the individual histone H1 family members. This region contains several cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation sites and is thought to function through a charge-neutralization process, neutralizing the DNA phosphate backbone to allow chromatin compaction. In this study, we use fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to define the behavior of the individual histone H1 subtypes in vivo. We find that there are dramatic differences in the binding affinity of the individual histone H1 subtypes in vivo and differences in their preference for euchromatin and heterochromatin. Further, we show that subtype-specific properties originate with the C terminus and that the differences in histone H1 binding are not consistent with the relatively small changes in the net charge of the C-terminal domains. H1 histones bind to DNA as they enter and exit the nucleosome. H1 histones have a tripartite structure consisting of a short N-terminal domain, a highly conserved central globular domain, and a lysine-and arginine-rich C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain comprises approximately half of the total amino acid content of the protein, is essential for the formation of compact chromatin structures, and contains the majority of the amino acid variations that define the individual histone H1 family members. This region contains several cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation sites and is thought to function through a charge-neutralization process, neutralizing the DNA phosphate backbone to allow chromatin compaction. In this study, we use fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to define the behavior of the individual histone H1 subtypes in vivo. We find that there are dramatic differences in the binding affinity of the individual histone H1 subtypes in vivo and differences in their preference for euchromatin and heterochromatin. Further, we show that subtype-specific properties originate with the C terminus and that the differences in histone H1 binding are not consistent with the relatively small changes in the net charge of the C-terminal domains. The H1 or “linker” histones are a family of very lysine-rich proteins that associate with the stretch of DNA that enters and exits the nucleosome. In the absence of histone H1, the nucleosome comprises ∼146 bp of DNA that wraps 1.75 turns around the outer surface of the histone octamer (1Whitlock Jr., J.P. Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3307-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 2Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X.

Histone H1, which is in an ∼1:1 ratio with the number of nucleosomes in the cell, bends and alters the path of the DNA entering and exiting the nucleosome such that the nucleosome adopts a lollipop-like conformation (4Bednar J. Horowitz R.A. Grigoryev S.A. Carruthers L.M. Hansen J.C. Koster A.J. Woodcock C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14173-14178Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 5Sivolob A.

This change in the trajectory of the linker DNA defines the first step in folding the polynucleosome chain into interphase chromosomes. The discovery of the H1 histones and the identification of its seven variants in the mid 1970s suggested possible roles in development (6Lennox R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 669-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional variant, referred to as H1oo, was recently isolated from the oocytes of mice (7Tanaka M. Hennebold J.D.

In simplistic terms, variants that have been associated with cellular differentiation are the histone H5 and histone H1.0 subtypes, and they are closer in amino acid sequences and most divergent from the other somatic histone H1 variants. Histone H5 is restricted to amphibian and reptile species, where it is found in high abundance in the nucleated but transcriptionally inert erythrocytes (16Parseghian M.H. Hamkalo B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Doenecke D. Albig W. Bode C. Drabent B. Franke K. Gavenis K. Witt O. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The nuclei of these mature erythrocytes are almost entirely heterochromatic, allowing them to maintain a very small total volume. In this case, histone H5 expression correlates with the cessation of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional program (18Andreeva N.B. Vishnevskaia T. Gazarian K.G. Mol. Biol. 1978; 12: 123-134Google Scholar, 19Bergman M.G. Wawra E. Winge M. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 91: 201-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Doenecke D. Tonjes R. Kress H. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1988; 27: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). It is thought that histone H5 functions to transcriptionally inactivate the genome as part of the terminal differentiation program of the erythrocyte (19Bergman M.G. Wawra E. Winge M. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 91: 201-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sun J.M. Wiaderkiewicz R. Ruiz-Carrillo A. Science. 1989; 245: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Histone H1.0 is the mammalian homolog and is closer in structure to H5 than the other H1 variants (22Schulze E. Schulze B. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Early studies showed that its abundance is increased in cells that are quiescent or terminally differentiated (14Moorman A.F. de Boer P.A. Charles R. Lamers W.H. Differentiation. 1987; 35: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is a recent study showing that overexpression of histone H1.0 can slow cell cycle progression and repress gene expression (23Brown D.T. Alexander B.T. Sittman D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Logan et al. (24Logan K.A. Dahmus M.E. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9658-9662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that histone H1.0 and RNA polymerase II shared a common antigenic epitope and suggested that H1.0 may compete for similar regions of the chromatin with RNA polymerase II. There are six histone H1 variants in the somatic cells in mammals, and they have a tripartite structure consisting of a central globular domain flanked by tail domains. The structure of the globular domain has been solved by X-ray crystallography (25Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and this domain has routinely been used for studies on reconstituted nucleosomes and chromatin (26Chan D.C. Biard-Roche J.

Although there are variations in the amino acid sequences, structural studies showed that the globular domain of histone H1.0 adopts a secondary structure that is similar to those of the other variants. The major differences between the variants lie in the flanking domains. Early studies done to define the functions of these domains using reconstituted chromatin showed that the N terminus was not required for inducing higher order structures (30Allan J. Mitchell T. Harborne N. Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C terminus was required, in addition to the globular domain, for H1-dependent chromatin folding but was not sufficient for the full nuclease protection afforded the nucleosome upon H1 binding (30Allan J. Mitchell T. Harborne N. Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have also revealed the prominent role that the C-terminal domain (CTD) 1The abbreviations used are: CTD, C-terminal domain; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. plays in determining the binding properties of histone H1s in vivo (31De S. Brown D.T. Lu Z.H. Leno G.H. Wellman S.E. Sittman D.B. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 292: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 33Hendzel M.J. Lever M.A. Crawford E. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) However, studies comparing the binding properties of the variants have been limited by the low sensitivity of the in vitro methods for assaying H1 binding. We have previously shown that fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) has the sensitivity to detect subtle differences in binding affinities of histone H1 in live cells (33Hendzel M.J. Lever M.A. Crawford E. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20028-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and we have used it here to examine the role of the CTD in affecting the binding affinities of individual variants. The C-terminal domain makes up half of the linker histone molecule, and the distinct features (e.g. the number of lysine residues and the (S/T)PXK phosphorylation motifs) of this domain in each variant are highly conserved between species. However, these features vary between the individual variants (35Ponte I. Vidal-Taboada J.M. Suau P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 702-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the functional heterogeneity observed among the mammalian subtypes of histone H1 resides in differences in the C-terminal domain. Relative to the histone proteins that comprise the nucleosome core particle, H1 histones have relatively low binding affinity to chromatin and have short residence times. This has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo (36Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using chimeric eGFP-histone H1 proteins stably expressed in human or mouse cell lines, it is possible to quantify this mobility inside the nuclei of live cells (37Carrero G. Crawford E. Th'ng J. de Vries G. Hendzel M.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 415-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Point mutations and deletion experiments using histone H1.1 showed that a single cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation site at specific regions within the C-terminal domain can control the association of the entire histone molecule (33Hendzel M.J. Lever M.A. Crawford E. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20028-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This observation is remarkably consistent with those made using partially deleted histone H1.0 on reconstituted chromatin (34Lu X. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), indicating that the results from these in vitro systems can be extrapolated to the living cell. Further analysis of the contribution of the C terminus of histone H1.1 revealed that this domain plays a key regulatory role in controlling linker histone function, further supporting the observations made using reconstituted chromatin. This provides an explanation for the interspecies conservation of the C-terminal sequences of each variant despite intraspecies divergence of the C terminus within each species. To further understand the mechanisms that influence both the binding and the function of H1 histones in vivo, we examined the binding properties of the six somatic mammalian subtypes in living cells and the influence of the C-terminal domain. We present results showing that the individual histone variants vary significantly with respect to their residency time in chromatin and that they have distinct localization patterns in the nuclei. This study, therefore, provides a mechanistic basis for the differences between individual histone H1 subtypes and sheds light on how these differences can dictate cellular functions. Cloning of Histone H1 Variants—PCR amplification of histone H1 variants were described by Lever et al. (32Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), using primers (synthesized by Sigma Genosys) designed from sequences available from GenBank™. The 5′-primers contained BglII restriction sequence and the 3′-primers contained BamHI restriction sequences for directional cloning into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The primer pairs for histone H1.0 (accession number X03473), the primer pairs were AGATCTATGACCGAGAATTCCACGTC and GGATCCTCACTTCTTCTTGCCGGCCC. For histone H1.1 (accession number X57130) were AGATCTATGTCTGAAACAGTGCCTCCC and GGATCCTTACTTTTTCTTGGGTGCCGC. For histone H1.2 (accession number X57129), the primer pairs were AGATCTATGTCCGAGACTGCTCCTGCC and GGATCCTATTTCTTCTTGGGCGCCGCTT. For histone H1.3 (accession number M60747), the primer pairs were AGATCTATGTCGGAGACTGCTCCACTT and GGATCCTCACTTTTTCTTCGGAGCTGC. For histone H1.4 (accession number M60748), the primer pairs were AGATCTATGTCCGAGACTGCGCCTGCC and GGATCCTACTTTTTCTTGGCTGCCGC. For histone H1.5 (accession number X83509), the primer pairs were AGATCTATGTCGGAAACCGCTCCTGCC and GGATCCTACTTCTTTTTGGCAGCCGC. To truncate histone H1.5 by terminal 12 amino acid residues, GGATCCTAAGCTTTAGGTTTTGCTGC was used as the 3′-primer. PCR was performed with AccuTaq LA DNA polymerase (Sigma) using genomic DNA from SK-N-SH cells as template, and the amplification products were transitionally cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), excised with BglII and BamHI, and transferred to similarly restricted pEGFP-C1. For cloning of the C-terminal domains, the 5′-primer sequence used for histone H1.1 CTD was AAGCTTCGTCCTCCGTGGAAACCAAG, and the 5′-primer for histone H1.5 was AAGCTTTTAAGGCGGCCTCCGGGGAA, and the 3′-primers was those used for amplification of the individual variants. The 5′-primers contained HindIII recognition sequence for directional cloning into HindIII- and BamHI-digested pEGFP-C1. These clones were used as templates to amplify the subdomains to construct the domain-switched mutants. Domain Switch between Histone H1 Variants—For domain switching between histone H1 variants, the N-terminal half containing the N-terminal and globular domains were amplified using the 5′-primers specific for each of the variants described above, and the antisense primer (GCCTTCTTGTTGAGTTTAAAGG) was complementary to the 3′-end of the highly conserved globular domain. The 5′-primer used to amplify the C-terminal domain has the sequence CTGGCTCCTTTAAACTCAACAAG and contains a stretch of nucleotides that is complementary to the antisense primer use for the globular domain. The 3′-primers used to amplify the CTD were the specific primers used to amplify the histone variants. The N-terminal and C-terminal halves were amplified from the individual clones and gel-purified and were mixed for reamplification using the 5′- and 3′-primers for the individual histone variants that were to be switched. The amplification products were gel-purified and cloned into pEGFP-C1 as described above. PCR products were sequenced by the Paleo-DNA Laboratory (Lakehead University) to verify the mutations. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—Cells were transfected with individual histone H1 constructs using Effectene (Qiagen), and stably expressing cells were generated by selection in G418 (Sigma). Following selection in G418, cells were plated onto number 1.5 glass coverslips, mounted in a small volume of tissue culture medium by creating a “well” with vacuum grease (Dow-Corning) on a glass slide. A 1.5-micrometer diameter region passing across the width of the cell nucleus was then photobleached, and recovery was monitored and quantified according to detailed procedures published elsewhere (37Carrero G. Crawford E. Th'ng J. de Vries G. Hendzel M.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 415-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) Sequence Conservation between Human Histone H1 Subtypes—We generated eGFP fusion proteins of histone H1 subtypes 1.1–1.5 as well as H10, a subtype that is up-regulated during entry into G0 as cells enter contact inhibition, senescence, or differentiation. Fig. 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the C-terminal domain illustrating the sequence differences and subdomains where structure or function have been mapped. To define the exact roles played by the CTDs in each of the variants, we generated eGFP fusion proteins of histone H1 subtypes 1.1–1.5 as well as H10. The eGFP was attached to the N terminus of each histone H1 variant because of our previous finding that fusion to the C terminus greatly influences binding of histone H1 to chromatin, as the CTD contains the variations between the individual subtypes. Histone H1.1 and H1.2 have the shortest C-terminal regions, whereas histones H1.4 and H1.5 have the longest C-terminal domains. Regions of the C-terminal domain where functions have been defined are indicated with bars in Fig. 1. Although these domains are very lysine-rich, each variant contains a different amount of lysines and arginines that confer different overall net positive charges on the C termini. The 103-amino-acid long CTD of histone H1.1 has the fewest with 38 lysines and 2 arginines, whereas histones H1.4 (110 amino acids containing 43 lysines and 1 arginine) and H1.5 (114 amino acids containing 46 lysines) have the largest number of positively charged amino acids. Not only is histone H1.1 the shortest subtype, it also differs from the remaining subtypes in having only two of the conserved cdk-dependent S/TPXK phosphorylation sites. Interestingly, histone H1.0 is the shortest of the linker histones, with a CTD of 97 amino acids but contains the highest density of basic amino acids with 1 arginine and 41 lysines. It also has one more S/TPXK motif than histone H1.1. Binding of Histone H1 Variants in Living SK-N-SH Cells— FRAP has proven to be a powerful tool for studying the chromatin binding properties of histone H1 and allows for measurements to be made within living cells. We have previously used this technique to reveal an unexpected destabilization of histone H1.1 binding to chromatin through a single amino acid substitution at position 152. This result, consistent with a recent in vitro study on the contribution of the C-terminal tail of histone H1.0 and histone H5, is inconsistent with the prevailing model of histone H1-DNA interaction that is based solely on electrostatic effects. Based on this result, we reasoned that the small but significant differences (or variations) in primary sequence among the six human somatic cell H1 histones will result in quite distinct binding properties in vivo. Fig. 2 shows examples of FRAP experiments comparing the recovery of fluorescence for each of the six major somatic H1 subtypes. The H1 histones, in fact, show remarkably different binding properties in vivo. Histones H1.1 and H1.2, which are distinguished by having the shortest C-terminal tails, rapidly undergo binding and dissociation events, requiring only 1–2 min to reach equilibrium. As mentioned previously, histone H1.0 has diverged in amino acid sequence, and the highly divergent C-terminal domain is the shortest among all of the H1 histones. Unlike H1.1 and H1.2, however, histone H1.0 takes longer to recover, requiring several minutes to equilibrate in the FRAP experiment. It is more closely aligned with the remaining H1 histones that have longer C-terminal domains, which exchange much more slowly. These histones, H1.3, H1.4, and H1.5, all require as much as 15 min to equilibrate after the initial photobleaching event. When we analyzed the recovery curves of ∼30 cells and compared the individual histone H1 subtypes for quantitative differences in binding, it can be seen that the different histone H1 subtypes spanned a broad range of recovery times (Fig. 3). The results suggest that the histone H1 variants bound to chromatin with different affinities in vivo. Fig. 3 shows the recovery profiles for histone H1 variants in human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Both histone H1.1 and histone H1.2 bound to chromatin with the lowest affinity, and this affinity increased sequentially with increasing CTD lengths of histones H1.3, H1.4, and H1.5. We tested the statistical significance of the differences in relative recovery required for 50% recovery, and this analysis segregated the H1 variants into three major binding groups. Histones H1.1 and H1.2 each had binding properties distinct from all other histone H1 variants. Histone H1.0 and histone H1.3 showed only modest differences that were not statistically significant from each other but were significantly different from the remaining histone H1 variants. Similarly, H1.4 and H1.5 had recoveries that were similar to each other but differed significantly from H1.0 and H1.3. This result suggests that the lengths of the CTD of histone H1.1–H1.5 have a major influence on the binding to chromatin. Although histone H1.0 has the shortest CTD, the binding studies suggest that other variations in the rest of the molecule may contribute to its increased binding affinity, such as the higher density of lysine content, and also the density and distribution of the DNA-binding S/TPXK motifs. The Effect of C-terminal Domain Swapping on Subtype Binding in Vivo—To further investigate the extent that the C-terminal domain defines the in vivo binding properties of the histone H1 subtypes, we performed domain switches between histone H1.1, the histone H1 subtype with the lowest binding affinity, and histones H1.4 and H1.5, the subtypes with the highest binding affinity. Fig. 4 shows that the H1.1-H1.4 hybrid, consisting of the N terminus and globular domains of histone H1.1 fused to the CTD of histone H1.4, requires considerably longer to equilibrate than the H1.4-H1.1 hybrid, which consists of the N terminus and globular domains of histone H1.4 fused to the CTD of histone H1.1. The replacement of the C-terminal domain of either H1.4 or H1.5 with that of H1.1 significantly reduced the duration of time required for the protein to equilibrate following photobleaching, down to that typical for histone H1.1. Conversely, when the C-terminal domain of histone H1.1 was replaced with either the C-terminal domain of histone H1.4 or histone H1.5, the duration of time required for the protein to equilibrate following photobleaching was significantly increased. For comparison, the wild type proteins are also shown. Role of the Extended C Terminus in Histone H1.5 Binding— One of the more obvious differences between the tight binding histone H1 variants, H1.4 and H1.5 versus the weaker binding histone H1.1 and H1.2 is the length of the C terminus. This contributes to a slight difference in the overall net charge but, when comparing H1.5 with H1.2 for example, there is no change in the number of T/SPXK sites previously implicated as DNA binding domains. Therefore, we tested whether this extension of the C terminus made a significant difference in the binding affinity of the H1.5 protein. Fig. 5 shows the recovery profiles of full-length and truncated histone H1.5. The C-terminal truncation of histone H1.5 results in a significant reduction in the time required for the H1.5 to equilibrate in the photobleached region. Localization of Histone H1 Variants within the Nucleus— Using variant-specific antibodies, histone H1 subtypes have been reported to have specific distributions in the nucleus. Because these differences were not observed when C-terminal GFP-tagged histones were used in a previous study of mouse H1 subtype binding, we reevaluated these results with our N-terminally tagged H1 histone proteins. Mouse fibroblast cell lines have visually distinct heterochromatic and euchromatic regions in their nuclei and were used to evaluate whether or not these H1 subtypes differed in how they distribute throughout the genome. The association of each H1 histone protein with pericentromeric heterochromatin is particularly easy to identify within mouse cells because they are visible as large condensed spheres of chromatin. Although all subtypes were at least occasionally present in mouse pericentromeric heterochromatin, we observed distinct differences in the overall relative distributions of the individual H1 subtypes. The most interesting example is histone H1.0, which was found to increase in quiescent and differentiated cells and has the greatest number of sequence changes when compared with the other somatic subtypes examined (see Fig. 1). Fig. 6 shows a three-dimensional deconvolution image of a mouse fibroblast where GFP-histone H1.0 is visualized simultaneously with Hoechst 33258 in a living cell nucleus. The DNA stained by Hoechst 33258 is false-colored red so that regions of overlap with the green fluorescent histones will appear as yellow. The green fluorescent histone H1.0 tended to localize in the euchromatin regions of the nucleus. Interestingly, a single heterochromatin domain is enriched in histone H1.0, whereas the pericentromeric heterochromatin tended to be depleted of histone H1.0. The other subtypes of linker histones also showed different distinct sublocalization patterns through the nucleus. The green fluorescence staining patterns showed that histones H1.1–H1.3 are found more commonly in euchromatin regions, whereas histones H1.4 and H1.5 are preferentially located in heterochromatin regions of the genome. Table I summarizes the relative distributions observed for ∼50 cells examined for each H1 histone variant.Table IThe percentage of cells showing enrichment in fluorescence in morphologically distinct chromatin types Five types of chromatin are distinguished, the dense chromatin surrounding the nucleolus (nucleolar HC), the pericentromeric heterochromatin (pericentromeric HC), regions of dense 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining outside of heterochromatic regions (Eu-high), regions where DAPI staining is evident as discrete chromatin fibers or domains (Eu-intermediate), and regions where DAPI is present but distinct chromatin structures are difficult to resolve (Eu-low).H1 subtypeNucleolar HCPericentromeric HCEu-highEu-intermediateEu-low1.033182257221.146505423231.22836221771.3739232661.458704444121.53357394516 Open table in a new tab The sequence conservation between human and mouse within individual variants is higher than the conservation between individual variants within each species (16Parseghian M.H. Hamkalo B.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Doenecke D. Albig W. Bode C. Drabent B. Franke K. Gavenis K. Witt O. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It was, therefore, surprising, when a previous study comparing the in vivo binding of histone H1 subtypes H10 and H1c, the murine homolog of histone H1.2, failed to observe a significant difference between the two (38Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). This has been well documented in vitro, where differences between histone H1 subtypes has been shown for both binding and the capacity to aggregate polynucleosomes into condensed structures (39Talasz H. Sapojnikova N. Helliger W. Lindner H. Puschendorf B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32236-32243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This implies functional differences between the different histone H1 subtypes, at least in the context of development of a complex organism. Genetic evidence for functional differences between histone H1 variants is beginning to emerge, and the earlier conclusions that specific subtypes are not critical for developmental regulation may turn out to be an oversimplification based on the ability of embryos to come to term and survive. For example, although histone H1.0 was originally defined as having no phenotype, it has recently been determined that there is a specific defect in dendritic cell differentiation. In this study, we have examined the in vivo binding properties of human histone H1 variants to determine whether or not these variants differ in their binding in living cells. One previous study examined this question using mouse histone H1 subtypes (38Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). A complication of this study was the use of C-terminal eGFP fusion proteins. We have recently demonstrated that C-terminal fusion of eGFP to histone H1 destabilizes the binding of this protein in vivo (33Hendzel M.J. Lever M.A. Crawford E. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20028-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This is now supported by the clear differences between histone H1 variants that are observed in these studies, which make use of N-terminal eGFP fusion proteins. We found that fusion to the N terminus has minimal effects on chromatin binding, most likely because physical studies showed that the distal subregion of the N-terminal domain is unstructured and do not bind chromatin (40Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L. Jimenez M.A. Rico M. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46429-46435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when we switched the CTDs between histones H1.1 and those of H1.4 and H1.5, this domain exerted a dominant influence over the binding of the hybrid histone, adopting the recovery profile of the native histone that donated the CTD. This shows clearly that the N-terminal domain does not exert much influence on the binding to chromatin. Initial examination of the recovery profiles of the histone H1 variants suggested a direct correlation between the length of the protein molecule and binding affinity. Because the globular domains are virtually identical, this correlation is with the C-terminal domain. However, this correlation was not seen with the shortest variant histone H1.0. When we compared the content of the lysine/arginine residues in the CTD, histone H1.0 has the highest density (42 basic residues in 97 amino acids), more than the stronger binding histones H1.4 (44 basic residues in 110 amino acids) and H1.5(46 basic residues in 114 amino acids). The presence of more of the S/TPXK phosphorylation sites in histone H1.4 and H1.5 would suggest that these DNA-binding motifs have greater influence on the binding affinities. The relative contributions to histone H1 binding of these basic amino acids and the S/TPXK motifs are currently being examined. Notably, the truncation of the C terminus of histone H1.5 to the length of histone H1.2 results in a significant reduction in the binding of the H1.5 protein. These results demonstrate that the S/TPXK motifs are not the sole determinants of the affinity of histone H1 binding. Histone H1.2 is the most abundant nuclear histone in most cell types and represents one of the more weakly bound subtypes, along with histone H1.1. This property may make histone H1.2 a very sensitive probe for double-strand breaks in the DNA. Histone H1.2 has recently been defined as a cytoplasmic cytochrome c-releasing factor that is genetically required for the induction of apoptosis following the introduction of doublestrand breaks (41Konishi A. Shimizu S. Hirota J. Takao T. Fan Y. Matsuoka Y. Zhang L. Yoneda Y. Fujii Y. Skoultchi A.I. Tsujimoto Y. Cell. 2003; 114: 673-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Histone H1.0 has been the most actively studied single histone H1 variant from mammalian species. Its sequence divergence and accumulation in terminally differentiated and aging tissues has led to the speculation that it is important in the terminal differentiation process. It was recently demonstrated that histone H1.0 is genetically required in the terminal differentiation of dendritic cells (42Gabrilovich D.I. Cheng P. Fan Y. Yu B. Nikitina E. Sirotkin A. Shurin M. Oyama T. Adachi Y. Nadaf S. Carbone D.P. Skoultchi A.I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 285-296PubMed Google Scholar). H1.0 knock-out mice are specifically deficient in this immune cell type. We find that histone H1.0 binds to chromatin with an intermediate affinity. More interesting, perhaps, is its preference for euchromatic regions of the genome and its depletion in heterochromatin. Enrichment in euchromatic regions of the nucleus imply that it is preferentially involved in the regulation of expressed and expression-competent regions of the genome. Its association with nondividing cells suggests that it may function to repress expression of genes that are no longer required, such as those associated with cell cycle progression. In summary, the results of our study show that the C-terminal domains, which distinguish the linker histone H1 variants from each other, also control binding to the chromatin. This domain was shown to be important for chromatin organization in early studies using reconstituted systems (30Allan J. Mitchell T. Harborne N. Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and we have confirmed this using live cells (33Hendzel M.J. Lever M.A. Crawford E. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20028-20034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The importance of these regions is further supported by the conservation between the mouse and human sequences in the distribution of the lysine residues and the cdk-dependent phosphorylation sites. These differences in the C terminus most likely determine the specific functions of the variants in mammalian cells and determine their distinct roles in the development of mammals."

In this study, we describe the reconstitution of PrPres amplification in vitro using partially purified and synthetic components. Overnight incubation of purified PrP27–30 and PrPC molecules at a molar ratio of 1:250 yielded ∼2-fold baseline PrPres amplification. Addition of various polyanionic molecules increased the level of PrPres amplification to ∼10-fold overall. Polyanionic compounds that stimulated purified PrPres amplification to varying degrees included synthetic, homopolymeric nucleic acids such as poly(A) and poly(dT), as well as non-nucleic acid polyanions, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Size fractionation experiments showed that synthetic poly(A) polymers must be >0.2 kb in length to stimulate purified PrPres amplification. Thus, one possible set of minimal components for efficient conversion of PrP molecules in vitro may be surprisingly simple, consisting of PrP27–30, PrPC, and a stimulatory polyanionic compound.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), 1The abbreviations used are: BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; PrP, prion protein; PrPres, protease-resistant prion protein (or PrPSc); PrPC, neuronal membrane protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PK, Proteinase K; HSPG, heparin sulfate proteoglycan. chronic wasting disease, and scrapie are fatal infectious diseases of the central nervous system with an unusual etiology. Many biochemical and biophysical experiments have shown that the infectious agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, termed prions, lack informational nucleic acids (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the replication of infectious prions in vivo and in cultured cells is generally accompanied by the transformation of the normal cellular isoform of a neuronal membrane protein (PrPC) into a protease-resistant state (PrPSc or PrPres) (2Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Caughey B. Neary K. Buller R. Ernst D.

Science. 1982; 218: 1309-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). These observations can be explained by the protein-only hypothesis, which contends that infectious prions are exclusively composed of misfolded PrP molecules such as PrPres (5Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4124) Google Scholar). In strong support of this hypothesis, Legname et al. (6Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.O. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 2004; 305: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated the generation of infectious prions in vitro by refolding purified recombinant PrP. Little is known about the molecular mechanism that mediates the self-propagating conversion of PrPC to PrPres. Several investigators have used a biochemical approach to investigate this process in vitro. Caughey and colleagues (7Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 8Bossers A. Belt P. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. de Vries R. Smits M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 3923-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) developed the first successful cell-free PrP conversion system by using a radiolabeled PrP substrate and showed that the efficiency of PrPC to PrPres conversion in vitro was dependent upon PrP sequence and prion strain in a manner that precisely modeled the specificity of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy transmission in vivo. Later, Saborio and Soto (11Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) developed the protein-misfolding cyclic amplification technique, in which crude brain homogenates are intermittently sonicated to generate much more efficient conversion of PrPC to PrPres than the radiolabel technique, resulting in high level amplification of PrPres levels. Even without sonication, a mixture of crude normal and diluted scrapie brain homogenates generates >6-fold amplification of PrPres after overnight incubation (11Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 12Lucassen R. Nishina K. Supattapone S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4127-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, a 50-fold stoichiometric excess of PrPres template is required to drive the conversion of radiolabeled PrPC molecules in a cell-free system containing only purified prion proteins (9Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). This discrepancy in the efficiencies of crude versus purified systems suggests that factors other than PrP molecules are required for efficient PrP conversion in vitro, and that crude brain homogenates contain such factors. Furthermore, several genetic and biochemical experiments have provided evidence for the existence of PrP conversion cofactors (13Telling G.C. Scott M. Mastrianni J. Gabizon R. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 79-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar, 14Saborio G.P. Soto C. Kascsak R.J. Levy E. Kascsak R. Harris D.A. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Deleault et al. (15Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Nature. 2003; 425: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) demonstrated that treatment of crude brain homogenates with RNase abolished PrPres amplification in vitro and that efficient PrPres amplification could be reconstituted by addition of exogenous mammalian RNA. These results showed that RNA molecules within crude brain homogenates promote efficient PrPres amplification in non-purified systems such as protein-misfolding cyclic amplification. However, studies in crude homogenates cannot determine whether RNA molecules alone are sufficient to drive efficient PrPres amplification, because it is possible that other factors within the homogenates are also required for the amplification process. Furthermore, it is not known whether RNA molecules stimulate PrPres amplification directly by binding to prion proteins, or indirectly, for instance by sequestering a reaction inhibitor or activating a catalyst (16Caughey B. Kocisko D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular requirements for PrPres amplification in vitro, we developed a series of protocols to isolate PrPC and PrPSc molecules under conditions that preserve their ability to reconstitute efficient PrPres amplification in vitro. Using these preparations, we have generated and characterized an efficient in vitro PrPres amplification system using only purified and synthetic components. Our results show that one possible set of minimal components for efficient amplification of PrPres in vitro may be surprisingly simple, consisting of PrPC, PrPSc, and a polyanionic compound. Reagents—Total brain ganglioside extract, ammonium salt, was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and resuspended in 1% Triton X-100. Glycogen was obtained from Invitrogen. Sodium pentosan polysulfate was obtained from the TSE Resource Center (Compton, UK) and dissolved in RNase-free 1× TE (10 mm Tris, 1mm EDTA), pH 8.0 (Ambion, Austin, TX). Heparan sulfate proteoglycan prepared from the basement membrane of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cells (molecular mass > 400 kDa, catalog number H4777), heparan sulfate, sodium salt from bovine kidney (molecular mass, ∼12–14 kDa, catalog number H7640), and polyglutamate (molecular mass, ∼50–100 kDa, catalog number P4886) were all obtained from Sigma. All synthetic polynucleotides were purchased from Sigma. The size distributions of these various commercial preparations were determined by a combination of agarose gel electrophoresis and size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography techniques (data not shown). The preparations assayed were: poly(A) catalog number P9403 (0.2–6 kb by agarose gel electrophoresis), poly(C) catalog number P4903 (∼6 kb by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography), poly(G) catalog number P4404 (∼0.2 kb by agarose gel electrophoresis), poly(U) catalog number P9528, (0.3–1 kb by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography), poly(dA) catalog number P0087 (∼1.5–4 kb by agarose gel electrophoresis), poly(dT) catalog number P6905 (∼1.5–4 kb by agarose gel electrophoresis), and poly(dC) catalog number P5444 (0.39 kb, according to manufacturer). Stock solutions of synthetic polynucleotides were prepared in 1× TE pH 8.0, and concentrations were confirmed by A260 nm. Preparation of IgG Cross-linked Protein A-Agarose Beads—All procedures were performed at room temperature. Four hundred microliters of ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein A Plus 50% slurry (Pierce) was mixed with 16 μg IgG per microliter of packed resin for 2 h. Following incubation, agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min and washed twice with 1 ml of 200 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0 (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium). Antibodies were cross-linked by incubation in 1 ml of 10 mm dimethyl pimelimidate hydrochloride (Pierce), 200 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and beads were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min. Cross-linked beads were then washed three times, once in phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium (PBS), 1% Triton X-100, and twice in PBS. Beads were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and stored at 4 °C. Immunopurification of PrPC from Hamster Brain—All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Four brains, including cerebellum and brainstem, from 8- to 12-week-old specific-pathogen-free Golden Syrian hamsters of either sex were homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold PBS plus Complete® protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) using a Biohomogenizer Mixer (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) at 7,000 rpm for 30–60 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,200 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of PBS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and Complete® protease inhibitors using a Wheaton glass Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes with pestle B). The sample was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The solubilized supernatant was removed and placed into a 50-ml conical tube with 400 μl of either D13 or 3F4 cross-linked protein A-agarose beads (50% slurry) and incubated end-over-end for 2 h. Beads were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were then washed once with 50 ml of Immunopure Gentle Ag/Ab Binding Buffer (Pierce), transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and washed in 1 ml of the same buffer. The beads were eluted twice with 500 μl of Immunopure Gentle Ag/Ab Elution Buffer (Pierce). The two eluate volumes were combined, diluted with 47 ml of IMAC-CuSO4 wash buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% Triton) plus EDTA-free Complete® protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), incubated with 2 ml of pre-equilibrated IMAC-CuSO4 resin (Amersham Biosciences) on an end-over-end rotator for 30 min, and centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 × g. The supernatant was removed and discarded, and the resin was washed twice in 50 ml of IMAC-CuSO4 wash buffer. PrPC was then eluted in 6 ml of IMAC-CuSO4 elution buffer (20 mm MOPS pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.15 m imidazole, 1% Triton X-100) containing EDTA-free Complete® protease inhibitors. Typically, the yield of PrPC was ∼10-fold higher when cross-linked 3F4 beads were used than when cross-linked D13 beads were used. Purification of PrPC from Hamster Brain by Conventional Affinity Chromatography—An alternative protocol for purifying PrPC from hamster brain was based on a modification of the method described by Pan et al. (17Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar, 18Pan K.M. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Ten hamster brains were homogenized in 5 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold PBS with Complete® protease inhibitors using a Potter homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100 × g for 30 s, and the post-nuclear supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 3,200 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 45 ml of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, containing EDTA-free Complete® protease inhibitors, homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and incubated on ice for 30 min to allow for membrane solubilization. The solubilized homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied to a pre-equilibrated 2-ml IMAC-CuSO4 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 20 ml of IMAC-CuSO4 wash buffer and eluted with10 ml of IMAC-CuSO4 elution buffer containing EDTA-free Complete® protease inhibitors. The eluate was applied to a pre-equilibrated 2-ml wheat germ agglutinin column (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), washed with 20 ml of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and eluted with 10 ml of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm N-acetylglucosamine, 1% Triton X-100 containing EDTA-free Complete® protease inhibitors. Preparation of PrP 27–30—Post-nuclear brain supernatants were prepared from Sc237 scrapie-infected brains as previously described (12Lucassen R. Nishina K. Supattapone S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4127-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One milliliter of Sc237 post-nuclear brain supernatant (0.4% w/v) in PBS-1% Triton X-100 was incubated with 10 μg/ml Proteinase K (PK, specific activity, 30 units/mg, Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C. Protease digestion was terminated by addition of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (from a 0.3 m stock solution in methanol). The digested sample was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, and resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold PBS-1% Triton X-100 by 10 × 5 s pulses of direct sonication with a Bandelin Sonopuls ultrasonicator delivering ∼55% power to the probe tip (Amtrex Technologies, Saint-Laurent, Canada). After addition of 100 μl of ice cold PBS-1% Triton X-100, the sample was sonicated for an additional 10 pulses as above. An additional 800 μl of ice-cold PBS-1% Triton X-100 was added, and the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was subjected to another identical round of resuspension and sonication to generate the final 1 ml of sample containing ∼10 ng/ml PrP27–30 in PBS plus 1% Triton X-100. In Vitro Amplification of PrPres—For experiments testing purified or synthetic compounds, each 100-μl amplification reaction contained 2.5 μg/ml PrPC and 10 ng/ml PrP27–30 in 0.75× PBS, 0.25× TE, 0.75% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA. In experiments testing the effects of Prnp0/0 mouse brain homogenate, each sample contained 5 μg/ml PrPC and 10 ng/ml PrP27–30 in PBS, 0.75% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA plus 2.5% (w/v) Prnp0/0 mouse brain post-nuclear supernatant or buffer. Samples were mixed at 37 °C and shaken overnight at 800 rpm (Eppendorf Thermomixer, Fisher Scientific). To detect PrPres, each sample was incubated with 60 μg/ml PK for 40 min at 37 °C, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to Western blotting using 3F4 monoclonal antibody as described previously (12Lucassen R. Nishina K. Supattapone S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4127-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Quantitation of PrPC, PrP27–30, and Western Blot Signals—PrPC and PrP27–30 were quantified by comparing dilutions of these preparations against known amounts of recombinant PrPC on Western blots (Prionics, Schlieren, Switzerland). Densitometric measurement of membrane marker film signals was performed through the analysis of multiple film exposures to ensure that comparisons were made within the linear range of the film. Signals within the linear range were quantified using the histogram functions in Adobe Photoshop and calibrated against the background signal. Serial dilutions of normal hamster brain were used to calibrate densitometric measurements. RNA Purification—All total RNA preparations were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from hamster liver total RNA using the Poly(A) Purist Kit (Ambion), and the sample that did not bind to the oligo(dT) column was designated Poly(A)– RNA. All RNA preparations were resuspended in 1× TE, pH 8.0, and the concentration and quality of each preparation were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by measuring A260 nm/A280 nm. Size Fractionation of Poly(A)—Synthetic poly(A) (Sigma catalog number P9403) was resuspended in 1× TE, pH 8.0, and the concentration was confirmed by A260 nm. A sample containing 200 μg of this preparation was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. Unstained slices corresponding to different mobility ranges were excised and extracted using a gel-extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Poly(A) 45-, 25-, and 10-mer oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT (Coralville, IA) and resuspended in 1× TE, pH 8.0. Concentrations of each poly(A) fraction were determined by A260 nm. Because post-translational modifications of PrPC might affect its ability to convert efficiently to PrPres, we chose to purify mature, mammalian PrPC directly from normal brain tissue using detergent solubilization (19Nishina K. Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2613-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To ensure that our results did not depend upon any peculiarities of one purification method, we developed two different protocols to generate PrPC molecules capable of undergoing efficient conversion to PrPres (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the first protocol, adapted from the method of Pan et al. (17Pan K.M. Baldwin M. Nguyen J. Gasset M. Serban A. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. Huang Z. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10962-10966Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar, 18Pan K.M. Stahl N. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), PrPC molecules were purified from solubilized brain membranes by sequential adsorption to copper and lectin affinity columns. This procedure produced a preparation that contained conversion-competent PrPC molecules, but also contained many contaminating proteins, resulting in <10% purity (data not shown). In the second protocol, PrPC was immunopurified using immobilized anti-PrP antibodies. This procedure generates samples containing PrPC with ∼50% purity; we identified one major contaminant as the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Fig. 1A). The three glycoforms of PrPC are identifiable as bands with molecular masses in the range from 30 to 33 kDa. As expected, these bands are more abundant in a sample purified from Tga20 transgenic PrP-overexpressing mice and absent from a sample prepared from Prnp0/0 mice (Fig. 1A). A preparation of immunopurified hamster PrPC was incubated overnight with purified Syrian hamster Sc237 PrP27–30 template at a molar ratio of 250:1, and PrPres amplification was measured. Co-incubation of these two purified prion proteins alone yielded ∼2-fold amplification of PrPres (Fig. 1B). Addition of Prnp0/0 mouse brain homogenate lacking PrPC to the mixture of purified proteins increased the PrPres amplification level to ∼10-fold (Fig. 1B), similar to the level of PrPres amplification in crude brain homogenates (12Lucassen R. Nishina K. Supattapone S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4127-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In control reactions, Prnp0/0 brain homogenate did not affect the protease resistance of either PrPC or PrP27–30 molecules in isolation (Fig. 1B). These results confirm that crude brain homogenates contain one or more cofactor(s) that promote the efficiency of PrPres amplification. We previously found that RNA molecules are required for efficient PrPres amplification in crude brain homogenates (15Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Nature. 2003; 425: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether isolated RNA molecules might stimulate PrPres amplification from purified prion proteins. We found that addition of total hamster liver RNA to a mixture of PrP27–30 and immunopurified PrPC molecules yielded ∼10-fold PrPres amplification (Fig. 1C). This result indicates that RNA molecules can act directly upon prion proteins without intermediary molecules and that purified PrPC, PrPSc, and RNA molecules are sufficient reconstitute PrPres amplification to the same level as crude brain homogenates. The efficiency of purified PrPres amplification stimulated by RNA is further increased by protein-misfolding cyclic amplification (11Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), resulting in >20-fold total PrPres amplification after 24 cycles, which again is similar to the level of PrPres amplification obtained with protein-misfolding cyclic amplification using reconstituted brain homogenate (Supplemental Fig. S1). In crude brain homogenates, RNA concentrations between 100 and 500 μg/ml stimulate PrPres amplification in a species-specific manner (15Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Nature. 2003; 425: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). For example, addition of total RNA prepared from hamster or mouse tissues increases PrPres amplification in crude brain homogenates, but addition of the total RNA prepared from a variety of non-mammalian species, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Escherichia coli, to crude homogenates does not affect amplification levels. To study the species specificity and potency of RNA stimulation in our purified system, we tested the ability of varying concentrations of total RNA prepared from a variety of species to stimulate purified PrPres amplification. Unexpectedly, we found that total RNA prepared from every species tested, including C. elegans and E. coli, potently stimulated PrPres amplification in our purified system (Fig. 2). For each preparation, the threshold RNA concentration for stimulation of purified PrPres amplification was ∼1 μg/ml, and stimulation was optimal at an RNA concentration of ∼10 μg/ml (Fig. 2). In contrast, the threshold concentration of total hamster liver RNA required to stimulate PrPres amplification in crude homogenates is ∼100 μg/ml, and the concentration required for optimal stimulation is ∼500 μg/ml (data not shown). Thus, RNA stimulation of PrPres amplification is both more potent and less specific in the purified system than in homogenate mixtures. These results suggest that no specific RNA species is uniquely responsible for stimulating purified PrPres amplification. To confirm this hypothesis, we compared the potencies of poly(A)+ and poly(A)– RNA for stimulation of purified PrPres amplification. The results indicate that, despite ∼100-fold enrichment of mRNA molecules in the poly(A)+ fraction compared with the poly(A)– fraction, the two preparations stimulated purified PrPres amplification with equal potency (Supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, we found no difference in stimulation potency between brain and liver total RNA, indicating that stimulatory RNA molecules are not specifically enriched in brain tissue (data not shown). Based on these results, we speculated that perhaps a broad range of polyanions might stimulate purified PrPres amplification, and therefore we tested a variety of pure compounds for their ability to stimulate PrPres amplification. We first assayed several commercially available preparations of synthetic homopolymeric nucleotides with overlapping size distributions. Among the compounds tested, poly(A) and poly(dT) stimulated PrPres amplification at a concentration of 1 μg/ml; poly(dA) stimulated PrPres amplification at a concentration of 100 μg/ml; and poly(C) failed to stimulate PrPres amplification at all concentrations tested (Fig. 3). Double-stranded plasmid DNA also stimulated amplification at a concentration of ∼10 μg/ml (Supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, these results indicate that RNA, single-stranded DNA, and double-stranded DNA molecules can stimulate purified PrPres amplification and that homopolymeric nucleotide preparations with overlapping size distributions differ in their ability to stimulate purified PrPres amplification, according to the rank order poly(A) = poly(dT) > poly(dA) > poly(C). To study in isolation the effect of polynucleotide size upon stimulatory activity, we tested discrete size fractions of poly(A) for their ability to stimulate PrPres amplification. The results indicate that poly(A) oligonucleotides ≤ 45 bases in length were unable to stimulate PrPres amplification; a fraction containing poly(A) polymers between 0.2 and 0.4 kb in length partially stimulated PrPres amplification; and poly(A) polymers > 4 kb in length strongly stimulated PrPres amplification (Fig. 4). Furthermore, monomeric nucleotides did not stimulate PrPres amplification at concentrations between 1 ng/ml and 100 μg/ml (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results indicate that the threshold size required for stimulation of purified PrPres amplification by poly(A) is ∼300 bases. Consistent with this estimate of threshold size, a uniform preparation of poly(G)-containing polymers ∼0.2 kb in length did not stimulate PrPres amplification, whereas a preparation of poly(U)-containing polymers 0.39 kb in length potently stimulated PrPres amplification (Supplemental Fig. S3).Fig. 6Western blot of purified PrPres amplification assays testing stimulation by free nucleotides, brain gangliosides, and glycogen. Samples containing purified hamster PrPC, Sc237 PrP27–30, and varying concentrations of each compound were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C and subjected to proteinase K digestion, except where indicated (-PK), as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several independent lines of investigation have implicated proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, particularly heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), in the pathogenesis of prion diseases (20Caughey B.

The broad pleiotropic and anti-viral effects of the interferons are mediated through signaling pathways that culminate in the enhanced expression of a temporally coordinated subset of cell type-specific proteins (1Der S.D.

The ISG15 polypeptide is induced by lipopolysaccharide and double-stranded RNA, both potent markers of parasitic and viral infection (7Memet S. Besancon F. Bourgeade M.F. Thang M.N. J. Interfer.

Res. 1998; 18: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ectopic overexpression of ISG15 directly inhibits human immunodeficiency virus replication by abrogating nuclear processing of unspliced viral RNA precursors, leading to accumulation of nascent transcripts (9Kunzi M.S. Pitha P.M. J. Interfer. Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, influenza B virus replication is blocked by endogenous ISG15 unless its expression is prevented by a specific transcriptional block mediated by the viral NS1 protein (10Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Most recently, murine knock-out studies implicate an essential role for ISG15 in innate immunity, a critical defense against infectious agents that guides subsequent host adaptive immune responses (11Ritchie K.J. Hahn C.S. Kim K.I. Yan M. Rosario D. Li L. de la Torre J.C. Zhang D.E. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Like most interferon-induced proteins, ISG15 is constitutively present in higher eukaryotes and serves additional function(s) unrelated to its role in anti-viral defenses (4Haas A.L. Ahrens P.

Pathol. 1995; 177: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recognition that ISG15 harbors tandem ubiquitin-like domains and terminates in a conserved 152LRLRGG157 ubiquitin C-terminal motif suggested some of the biological effects attributed to the polypeptide were directed in part by its conjugation to cellular targets (4Haas A.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunochemical studies confirm that ISG15 conjugates are abundant in eukaryotic cells and increase significantly in response to interferon induction (13Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8408-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The ISG15 polypeptide was the first example identified of the superfamily of Class 1 ubiquitin-like proteins, defined by their ability to undergo covalent ligation reactions to specific cellular targets (reviewed in Refs. 15Larsen C.N. Wang H. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and 16Schwartz D.C. Hochstrasser M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 321-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Nascent ISG15 is synthesized as an inactive precursor in which the mature glycine C terminus that participates in isopeptide bonds to cellular targets is blocked by an extension peptide that is post-translationally processed by the human ortholog of Ubp1 to yield the active ISG15 protein (17Potter J.L. Narasimhan J. Mende-Mueller L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25061-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an extracellular cytokine activity of ISG15 in stimulating interferon-γ production and natural killer cell proliferation also requires an intact mature ISG15 C terminus (18D'Cunha J.

Conjugation of ISG15 utilizes a parallel but distinct mechanism to that of ubiquitin (19Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

Marked ablation of UbE1L levels in various small cell lung carcinoma lines suggests loss of ISG15 conjugation is a contributing factor in malignant transformation (20McLaughlin P.M. Helfrich W.

Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). Similarly, induction of UbE1L is directly implicated in retinoic acid-mediated remission during acute promyelocytic leukemia (22Meraro D. Gleit-Kielmanowicz M. Hauser H. Levi B.Z. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6224-6231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), evidence for which includes the observation that either ectopic over expression of UbE1L or its induction by all-trans retinoic acid triggers 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation of promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-α protein and apoptosis in promyelocytic leukemia (23Kitareewan S. Pitha-Rowe I. Sekula D. Lowrey C.H. Nemeth M.J. Golub T.R. Freemantle S.J. Dmitrovsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3806-3811Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). More recently, human UbcH8 has been identified as the E2 conjugating enzyme for ISG15 and requires the action of UbE1L for ATP-dependent formation of the obligate UbcH8-ISG15 thiolester intermediate for conjugation (24Zhao C. Beaudenon S.L. Kelley M.L. Waddell M.B. Yuan W. Schulman B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Cognate isopeptide ligases required for ISG15 conjugation have not been definitively identified to date but are suggested to overlap with a subset of putative ubiquitin-dependant ligases requiring UbcH8 (24Zhao C. Beaudenon S.L. Kelley M.L. Waddell M.B. Yuan W. Schulman B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A limited number of protein targets for ISG15 conjugation have been reported, including the murine serpin 2a induced in response to parasite infection (25Hamerman J.A. Hayashi F. Schroeder L.A. Gygi S.P. Haas A.L. Hampson L. Coughlin P. Aebersold R. Aderem A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2415-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and components of the Janus tyrosine kinase-STAT signaling pathway (26Malakhova O.A. Yan M. Malakhov M.P. Yuan Y. Ritchie K.J. Kim K.I. Peterson L.F. Shuai K. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, observation that disruption of intracellular ISG15 conjugation dynamics by loss of function mutations in the ISG15-specific isopeptidase UBP43 results in severe developmental neurological defects hints at more global roles for ISG15 ligation (27Malakhov M.P. Malakhova O.A. Kim K.I. Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Although ISG15 was the first ubiquitin-like protein identified (4Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), much less is known about the functional roles of this polypeptide than for other members of the superfamily. In part this derives from the remarkable absence of ISG15 orthologs in lower eukaryotes that precludes the powerful genetic approaches successfully exploited previously with its more ubiquitously distributed paralogs (13Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the marked instability of ISG15 noted in early work continues as a major impediment to detailed in vitro analysis (28Korant B.D. Blomstrom D.C. Jonak G.J. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14835-14839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies we demonstrate that the inherent instability of recombinant ISG15 derives from disulfide-linked dimerization through Cys78 of the polypeptide, point mutation of which to serine markedly increases the stability of the polypeptide to that approaching ubiquitin. Enhanced stability has allowed the crystallization and structural determination of recombinant ISG15 for the first time. The 2.4-Å crystal structure for ISG15 confirms the tandem ubiquitin-like domains of β-grasp folds originally proposed on the basis of sequence analysis (13Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure for ISG15 reveals a novel surface charge distribution between the β-grasp domains and an extensive solvent-exposed surface of low polarity encompassing a substantial fraction of the N-terminal β-grasp domain. Finally, docking simulations using the recent structure for Nedd8 bound to its cognate activating enzyme, the AppBp1-Uba3 heterodimer (29Walden H. Podgorski M.S. Huang D.T. Miller D.W. Howard R.J. Minor D.L. Holton J.M. Schulman B.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1427-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), suggests the basis for the specificity of UbE1L for ISG15 activation. Bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma and purified to apparent homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography (30Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Human recombinant proISG15 was that described previously (17Potter J.L. Narasimhan J. Mende-Mueller L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25061-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The complete coding sequence for human ISG15-activating enzyme UbE1L (generous gift of Robert M. Krug) was subcloned by PCR from a modified pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (10Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) into the BamH1/EcoR1 sites of pGEX to yield pGEX-UbE1L. Human GST-UbE1L was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pGEX-UBE1L following isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The resulting recombinant GST-UbE1L was purified on glutathione-Sepharose following the manufacturer's instructions. Expression and Purification of Recombinant ISG15—Ubiquitin and other type 1 ubiquitin-like proteins are sensitive to proteolytic inactivation through cleavage of their C-terminal glycine dipeptide by a widely expressed bacterial periplasmic carboxypeptidase (19Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem in the present studies, a CGT codon for arginine was inserted between the mature human ISG15 C-terminal glycine GGC codon and the TAA STOP codon of pETUCRP (13Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by PCR using an appropriately designed 3′-external primer containing a BamH1 restriction site. The resulting full-length PCR-amplified DNA was restricted with NcoI/BamH1 then ligated into a similarly restricted pET11d plasmid to yield pET11d-ISG15-R158. Because the bacterial carboxypeptidase that inactivates ubiquitin-like proteins is incapable of removing a C-terminal arginine residue, the presence of Arg158 provided a cap residue to protect the integrity of the mature ISG15 C terminus during purification. In addition, the shift in pI from 6.7 for wild type mature polypeptide to 8.5 for recombinant ISG15-R158 enhanced resolution of the latter from contaminating proteins that were otherwise difficult to remove without additional chromatographic steps that reduced yield. Circular dichroism studies described under “Results” demonstrated that recombinant wild-type ISG15 exhibited significant structural instability resulting from its propensity spontaneously to form a disulfide-linked dimer during expression and purification. Disulfide-dependent instability was addressed by mutating the single Cys78 of human mature ISG15-R158 to serine, yielding ISG15C78S-R158. The Cys78 codon within pET11d-ISG15-R178 was mutated by overlap extension PCR using appropriately designed oligonucleotide primers, then the complete coding region was restricted with NcoI/BamH1 and ligated into similarly restricted pET11d to yield pET11d-ISG15C88S-R158. In subsequent functional studies, we found that recombinant mature ISG15 and ISG15C78S, from which the protective arginine caps had been proteolytically processed, were poorly radioiodinated by chloramine T using a protocol previously successful with ubiquitin and Nedd8 (31Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bohnsack R.N. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26823-26830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Poor radioiodination presumably resulted from the relative solvent inaccessibility of the tyrosine residues within the ISG15 structure compared with the other two Type 1 ubiquitin-like proteins, ultimately confirmed by the refined crystal structure of the polypeptide. Overlap extension PCR was exploited to mutate the Asn13 codon of human mature pET11d-ISG15C78S-R158 to tyrosine, yielding pET11d-ISG15N13Y/C78S-R158, to generate a solvent-accessible site for radioiodination, predicted from the subsequent structure for ISG15C78S. Five liters of E. coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring either pET11d-ISG15-R158, pET11d-ISG15C88S-R158, or pET11d-ISG15N13Y/C78S-R158 were grown at 30 °C to A600 nm of ∼0.6 in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin then induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. After additional 1.5-h incubation at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The resulting cell pellet was suspended in 100 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, then lysed at 12,000 p.s.i. in a French pressure cell (all subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C). Crude extract was centrifuged at 105 × g for 60 min, after which supernatant proteins precipitating between 30 and 50% saturated ammonium sulfate were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, and dialyzed against 2 × 4 liters of the same using dialysis tubing having a 3.5-kDa exclusion limit. The sample was then applied to a 5 × 20 cm column of DEAE-52 anion exchange cellulose (Whatman) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT. Fractions containing the unadsorbed fraction were pooled then adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate and applied to a 3- × 29-cm column of Phenyl-Superose FAST FLOW equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1.0 m ammonium sulfate and 1 mm DTT. Bound proteins were eluted by a 1.0-0 m negative salt gradient (5 mm/ml) at 2 ml/min. Recombinant ISG15-R158, ISG15C78S-R158, and ISG15N13Y/C78S-R158 elute as single peaks at 0.4 m ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing ISG15-R158 or the two point mutants were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration to ∼5 ml then resolved at 1 ml/min on a 1.5- × 30-cm column of Sepharose 6 FAST FLOW equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 25 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were pooled then dialyzed against 1 mm DTT using 3.5-kDa exclusion tubing. The protective Arg158 cap was removed from purified recombinant ISG15 polypeptides by exploiting the absolute specificity of porcine pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (EC 3.4.17.2) for cleaving C-terminal lysine and arginine residues. Recombinant ISG15-R158, ISG15C78S-R158, or ISG15N13Y/C78S-R158 at a concentration of 3-5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT was incubated for 4-6 h at 20 °C in the presence of 2 IU of carboxypeptidase B (Sigma). Quantitative processing was assessed by analytical isoelectric focusing (19Narasimhan J. Potter J.L. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In preliminary experiments we determined that the commercial carboxypeptidase B enzyme contained trace contaminating carboxypeptidase A-like activity that slowly cleaved the exposed glycine dipeptide following processing. The latter activity could be resolved from the carboxypeptidase B by dissolving the commercial enzyme in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) then isocratically passing the sample through a Mono S HR5/5 cation exchange column equilibrated with the same. Carboxypeptidase B free of the contaminating carboxypeptidase A-like activity appeared in the unadsorbed fraction of the Mono S column. The resulting mature ISG15, ISG15C78S, or ISG15N13Y/C78S proteins were resolved from carboxypeptidase B by Superdex 75 HR 10/30 analytical gel filtration chromatography in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT at 1 ml/min flow rate. Mature recombinant ISG15 or its point mutants eluted as single apparently homogeneous peaks at their predicted monomer molecular masses of ∼17 kDa. Concentrations of recombinant ISG15 and ISG15C78S were spectrophotometrically quantitated using an empirically determined 280 nm extinction coefficient of 0.91 ml/mg·cm (13Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of recombinant ISG15N13Y/C78S was quantitated similarly using an empirical extinction coefficient of 0.98 ml/mg·cm. Typical final yields for all three recombinant forms of ISG15 were 2-3 mg/liter of culture. Samples were flash frozen in small aliquots and stored at -80 °C. A 1-mg aliquot of ISG15N13Y/C78S was radioiodinated by the chloramine-T protocol developed previously for labeling of ubiquitin and Nedd8 (31Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Bohnsack R.N. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26823-26830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), yielding a specific radioactivity of 51,900 cpm/pmol. CD Spectroscopy Studies—Circular dichroism was monitored using a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermostatted cell holder and interfaced with a Neslab RTE-111 water bath. A thermostatted cylindrical cuvette with a 1-mm path length was used for all measurements. The CD signal (average of four scans) was measured from 190 to 260 nm for solutions containing the indicated concentration of protein dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.2 mm DTT equilibrated to 20 °C. Secondary structure calculations obtained from the CD spectra were based on the self-consistent method of Sreerama and Woody (33Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 34Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). For measurement of protein unfolding by urea denaturation, equimolar concentrations of recombinant protein were prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 mm DTT then mixed with an appropriate concentration of 9 m urea (ultrapure DNA sequencing grade) dissolved in the same buffer to produce the indicated range of final urea concentrations. Solutions were allowed to equilibrate for at least 30 min before collecting spectra, which were constant with time thereafter. The free energy of denaturation was calculated assuming a two-state model (35Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press-Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). The equilibrium constant K was determined by the change in ellipticity at 222 nm according to the relationship, K = e-ΔGapp/RT = ([θ]N - [θ])/([θ]) - [θ]D), where [θ]N and [θ]D are the ellipticities for the native and denatured states, respectively, which were obtained by a least squares analysis of the pre- and post-transition regions, and [θ] is the residue ellipticity at each urea concentration (35Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press-Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). The apparent free energy of denaturation ΔGapp, varies linearly with denaturant concentration in the transition region about the inflection point when the fraction denatured, FD, is plotted versus denaturant concentration and is given by the relationship, ΔGapp = ΔGH2O - m[denaturant], in which ΔGH2O is the apparent free energy for denaturation in the absence of denaturant. The value for ΔGH2O is obtained by linear extrapolation of ΔGapp to [denaturant] = 0. The slope, m, of the resulting plot is formally a function of the difference in the denaturant molecules bound to the denatured and native states of the protein (35Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press-Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 311-330Google Scholar). Crystallization of ISG15—An initial crystallization screen was performed by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method (36McPherson A. Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar) following the sparse matrix protocol (37Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). One of the conditions yielded microcrystals within 1-2 days, and refinement of this condition resulted in thin plate-like crystals. The refined crystallization condition involved mixing equal volumes of the ISG15C78S protein (12 mg/ml) with the precipitating solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.2 m MgCl2) and equilibrating against the precipitating solution. Larger single crystals were subsequently obtained by seeding the thin small crystals in the same solution but containing a lower concentration of the protein (10 mg/ml). Diffraction quality crystals grew to 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.05 mm within 2 weeks after seeding. In contrast, no crystals were obtained from wild-type ISG15 under similar conditions, presumably because of disulfide induced instability of the protein. Data Collection—The crystal was mounted in a glass capillary, and diffraction data were collected at 4 °C on an R-axis IIC image plate detector system with a Rigaku rotating anode generator. Data were collected by the oscillation method and processed using the HKL program package (38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Native ISG15C78S crystals belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 55.2 Å, b = 57.1 Å, and c = 104.2 Å, containing two ISG15 molecules per asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.4 Å3/Da). However, upon addition of heavy atom compounds, P212121 crystals were converted to another crystal form, making it difficult to obtain a heavy atom derivative. Soaking crystals belonging to the P212121 form in a solution containing 5 mm K2OsCl6 converted the crystals to the space group I222 (cell dimensions, a = 55.8 Å, b = 56.9 Å, and c = 103.7 Å). After data collection the osmium-soaked I222 crystal was recovered from the capillary and soaked again in a solution of 2 mm K2PtCl4 for 3 h, after which the derivative data were collected from a different portion of the same crystal that had not been exposed to the x-ray beam. The resulting platinum derivative was isomorphous with the osmium derivative, hence the osmium data were treated as a native data set for subsequent structure determination (Table I).Table IData collection and refinement statisticsP212121 formI222 formNativeaSoaked with K2OsCl6 to convert to the I222 form and treated as the native crystal.Pt-derivativebThe Os-soaked crystal was soaked again in a solution containing 3 mm K2PtCL4 for 3 h.Data collectionResolution (Å)3"

In this study we compared the ability of the four EETs (5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs) to regulate endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo and determined the molecular mechanism by which EETs control these events. Inhibition of the epoxygenase blocked serum-induced endothelial cell proliferation, and exogenously added EETs rescued cell proliferation from epoxygenase inhibition. Studies with selective ERK, p38 MAPK, or PI3K inhibitors revealed that whereas activation of p38 MAPK is required for the proliferative responses to 8,9- and 11,12-EET, activation of PI3K is necessary for the cell proliferation induced by 5,6- and 14,15-EET. Among the four EETs, only 5,6- and 8,9-EET are capable of promoting endothelial cell migration and the formation of capillary-like structures, events that are dependent on EET-mediated activation of ERK and PI3K. Using subcutaneous sponge models, we showed that 5,6- and 8,9-EET are pro-angiogenic in mice and that their neo-vascularization effects are enhanced by the co-administration of an inhibitor of EET enzymatic hydration, presumably because of reduced EET metabolism and inactivation. These studies identify 5,6- and 8,9-EET as powerful and selective angiogenic lipids, provide a functional link between the EET proliferative chemotactic properties and their angiogenic activity, and suggest a physiological role for them in angiogenesis and de novo vascularization.

Interest in the biochemical mechanism of angiogenesis, the de novo formation of blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, stems from the critical roles played by this process in the pathophysiology of inflammation, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.

More recently, 11,12-EET was identified as an angiogenic molecule, and in vitro roles for cyclooxygenase-2 and EGF receptor identified (10Michaelis U.R. Fisslthaler B. Medhora M. Harder D. Fleming I. Busse R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 11Michaelis U.R. Falck J.R. Schmidt R. Busse R. Fleming I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Harder D. Fleming I. Busse R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Hoebel B.G. Steyrer E. Graier W.F. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1998; 25: 826-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, only a few studies have addressed whether activation of these downstream pathways are indeed required to mediate these EET-induced cell responses. Whereas the mitogenic activity of 11,12- and 14,15-EET, and the signaling pathways for 14,15-EET are well documented, less is known regarding the proliferative and/or angiogenic properties of 5,6- and 8,9-EET and their potential mechanisms of action. The biosynthesis of 8,9-EET from endogenous fatty acid pools is well documented (12Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 163-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that of the labile 5,6-EET has been inferred from the identification of its hydration product, 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-DHET), in several biological samples (12Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 163-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Spector A.A. Fang X. Snyder G.D. Weintraub N.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these EETs are known to circulate, associated with plasma lipoproteins, in rat and human blood (12Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 163-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here (i) the characterization of 5,6-and 8,9-EET as powerful mitogens, and selective chemotactic lipids for primary cultures of mouse pulmonary endothelial cells; (ii) the identification of the intracellular signaling pathways associated with their proliferative and chemotactic activities; and (iii) the demonstration of a role for these two EETs in promoting de novo angiogenesis in vivo. The observation that inhibition of enzymatic EET hydration potentiates the angiogenic activities of 5,6- and 8,9-EET suggests that inhibitors of epoxide hydrolase(s) could serve to promote angiogenesis in pathophysiological conditions in which de novo vascularization is compromised. Synthesis of EETs by Endothelial Cells—Pulmonary murine microvascular endothelial cells were isolated and cultured as previously described (23Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Cells at early passages (1Fosslien E. Ann. Clin. Lab Sci. 2001; 31: 325-348PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gately S. Li W.W. Semin. Oncol. 2004; 31: 2-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nie D. Honn K.V. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 2004; 30: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were used for these studies because the expression of CYP2Cs in cultured endothelial cells decreases with increased cell passage (24Fleming I. Pharmacol. Res. 2004; 49: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To study cellular EET synthase activity, semiconfluent endothelial cells (passage 3) were cultured in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of arachidonic acid (10 μm). After 4 or 24 h, the cells and the medium were removed from the plates, and the suspension centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet and a medium-containing supernatant. The medium was mixed with 10 ng each of 1-14C-labeled DHETs (55 μCi/μmol; 95 atom % enrichment in 14C) or 1-14C-labeled EETs (55 μCi/μmol) and extracted with ethyl acetate. The EETs and DHETs present in the culture medium were purified by reversed-phase HPLC (25Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), converted to the corresponding pentafluorobenzylesters (EETs) or pentafluorobenzylester-trimethylsilylether derivatives, and quantified by NICI/GC/MS exactly as described (26Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cell pellets were suspended in PBS, mixed with 10 ng each of 1-14C-labeled EETs and DHETs (55 μCi/μmol), and extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The organic extracts were submitted to alkaline hydrolysis, and EETs and DHETs purified and quantified by NICI/GC/MS exactly as described (26Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Prior to use, synthetic EETs and DHETs were purified by reversed-phase HPLC (25Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The labile 5,6-EET was purified by normal phase HPLC on a μSorb silica column (250 × 4.6 mm; 5μ), using hexane containing 0.5% HOAc and 2% 2-propyl alcohol as mobile phase at 2 ml/min. Proliferation Assays—Endothelial cells (5 × 103/96-well plates) were plated in EGM-2-MV (Clonetics) containing 5% fetal calf serum with or without different concentrations of synthetic 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs or their corresponding DHETs. In some experiments cells were incubated in 5% fetal calf serum in the absence or presence of various concentrations of the EET synthase inhibitors N-methylsulfonyl-6-(2-proparglyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH) and ketoconazole (17Spector A.A. Fang X. Snyder G.D. Weintraub N.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 27Wang M.H. Brand-Schieber E. Zand B.A. Nguyen X. Falck J.R. Balu N. Schwartzman M.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 966-973PubMed Google Scholar), or adamantyl-cyclohexyl-urea (ACU), an inhibitor of cytosolic epoxide hydrolase (17Spector A.A. Fang X. Snyder G.D. Weintraub N.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Two days after, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well), the cells incubated for another 48 h, and their levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation determined as described (23Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In some experiments endothelial cells were plated as above and serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were then cultured in serum-free medium containing [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) with or without 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EETs or their corresponding DHETs. Some cells were also treated with 10 μm MS-PPOH, ketoconazole, or ACU added alone or in combination with each EET (1 μm, each). Twenty-four hours later, cells were collected and proliferation determined as above. To determine the pathways involved in the EET-induced cell proliferation, 24 h serum-starved cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing [3H]thymidine (10 μCi/ml) with or without the individual EET regioisomers (1 μm), and in the presence or absence of either a MEK1 inhibitor (PD98059) (10 μm), a p38 MAPK inhibitor (10 μm) (cat. number 506126) or a PI3K inhibitor (wortmannin) (0.1 μm) (all from Calbiochem). After 24 h, the cells were collected, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined as above. At least three independent experiments with quadruplicate samples were performed for each set of experiments described above. The [3H]thymidine incorporation assay was also corroborated by manual cell counting (not shown). Migration Assay—Cell migration was assayed in transwell plates fitted with 8-μm membrane filters (Corning Ware). Lower wells were coated by an overnight incubation with collagen type I (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C and then incubated 1 h at 37 °C with bovine serum albumin (1% in PBS) to inhibit nonspecific cell migration. Serum-free medium with or without 1 μm EETs was then added to the lower wells and 24 h serum-starved endothelial cells (5 × 104 cells in 300 μl of serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) to the upper wells. To determine the contribution of ERK, p38, and PI3K in EET-induced migration, serum-starved cells were allowed to migrate as indicated above with the difference that PD98059 (10 μm), P38 MAPK inhibitor (10 μm), or wortmannin (100 nm) were added to both upper and lower wells. After 12 h at 37 °C, cells on the top of the filter were removed by wiping, and the filters were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Migrating cells were stained with 1% crystal violet, and five randomly chosen fields from triplicate wells were counted at ×400 magnification. Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate. Matrigel-based Capillary Formation Assay—Capillary-like formation was analyzed as described (28Kubota Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Lawley T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl of Matrigel and incubated 30 min at 37 °C. Serum-starved endothelial cells (1 × 104) were plated over solidified Matrigel in 200 μl of serum-free medium with or without EETs (1 μm). To determine the contribution of EET synthases in capillary-like formation, endothelial cells were plated on Matrigel in 200 μl of complete medium in the presence or absence of different concentrations of MS-PPOH or ketoconazole. Capillary-like structures were recorded (3 images per gel per treatment) hourly for a period of 10 h, and representative images taken 3 h after plating are shown. To quantify capillary-like network formation, cellular nodes were defined as junctions linking at least three cells, and they were counted from digital images. Four independent experiments were performed with a total of 12 images analyzed per treatment. Western Blot Analysis and Reverse Transcriptase PCR Analysis—To evaluate the effects of EETs on ERK, p38, and Akt phosphorylation, semiconfluent endothelial cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then treated with the EET (1 μm each) for 0, 10, and 40 min. The cells were washed with PBS, collected, suspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS/PAGE (10% gels; 50 μg of total protein/lane) and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were incubated with a rabbit anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-p38, or anti-phospho-Akt antibody (all from Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and an ECL kit (Pierce). Total ERK, p38, and Akt content were verified by stripping the membranes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, containing 2% SDS and 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 55 °C, and re-probing with a rabbit anti-ERK, anti-p38, or anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). EET synthase expression in endothelial cell lysates (50 μg of protein/lane) was analyzed as above using a rabbit anti-CYP2C23 or anti-CYP2C11 (14Holla V.R. Makita K. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Capdevila J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) antibody, cross-reactive against the murine Cyp2c44and Cyp2c38 EET synthase, respectively. Purified cyp2c44 or cyp2c38 (20 ng/lane) was used as positive controls. Total RNA was purified from primary pulmonary endothelial cells (passage 2) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were reverse-transcribed using a SuperScript II™ kit and oligo(dT) (12-18 bp), and cDNAs amplified using the following mouse Cyp2c isoform-specific PCR primers: Cyp2c38 (300 bp) sense, 5′-tttgtgaatggattaattgc-3′, antisense, 5′-tgccggtgaagttttattct-3′; Cyp2c44 (700 bp) sense, 5′-ttggatcctggcctaccgtg-3′, antisense, 5′-tgtctctgtgcctgccgtaa-3′. These primers are cDNA-specific in that they amplify exons that are separated by intronic sequences in the genomic DNA. The following primers for β-actin (800 bp) were used as positive control: sense, 5′-ccagagcaagagaggtatcctgac-3′, antisense, 5′-aatctccttctgcatcctgtcagc-3′. Immunofluorescence—Frozen sections (7-μm each) of tumors derived from human non-small cell lung cancer cells grown subcutaneously for 3 weeks in athymic nude mice were costained with biotinylated rabbit anti-rat CYP2C23 (1:300) and rat anti-mouse CD31 (1:100, PharMingen) followed by FITC-conjugated streptavidin (1:200, Sigma), RITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:200, Jackson), and DAPI (2 ng/ml, Sigma) to visualize cell nuclei. Fluorescence emissions were with an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a triple filter channel. In Vivo Angiogenesis—The subcutaneous sponge model was used to determine the effects of EETs on in vivo angiogenesis (29Shi Y. Reitmaier B. Regenbogen J. Slowey R.M. Opalenik S.R. Wolf E. Goppelt A. Davidson J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 303-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Sterile polyvinyl acetal CF-50 round sponges (8 × 3 mm, a gift from Dr. J. M. Davidson, Vanderbilt University) were implanted under the dorsal skin of 129 SvJ male mice (6 weeks of age, 20 g body weight, n = 5/treatment). The sponges were then injected every second day for 14 days with 50 μl of either vehicle (corn oil), EETs (50 μm), ACU (250 μm), or a mixture of EET and ACU (50 and 250 μm, respectively). Ten minutes before sacrifice, mice were injected intravenously with 50 μl of rhodamine-dextran (Mr 65, 2% in PBS, Sigma) to label blood vessels (30Brantley D.M. Cheng N. Thompson E.J. Lin Q. Brekken R.A. Thorpe P.E. Muraoka R.S. Cerretti D.P. Pozzi A. Jackson D. Lin C. Chen J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7011-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and the sponges were subsequently collected and analyzed under an epifluorescence microscope. Rhodamine-dextran-positive structures were imaged, the color images converted to black and white pictures using Photoshop (Adobe), and processed as described (23Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Vascularity within sponges was expressed as a percentage of area occupied by rhodamine-dextran-positive structures per microscopic field. Three images/sponge with a total of 15 images per treatment were used for analysis. Statistical Analysis—The Student's t test for comparisons between two groups, and analysis of variance using Sigma-Stat software for statistical differences between multiple groups. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Microvascular Endothelial Cells Express CYP2C Isoforms and Biosynthesize EETs—To establish the presence of a functional epoxygenase in mouse lung endothelial cells, we quantified cellular EETs and DHETs by the isotope ratio GC/MS method (26Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Lung endothelial cells generate epoxygenase metabolites from endogenous precursors. Whereas EETs were found only in the cell pellet (∼0.37 ng/mg total proteins), their hydrated products, the DHETs, were mostly secreted into the culture medium (∼0.65 ng/mg). Incubation of the cells with exogenous arachidonic acid for 4 or 24 h significantly increased the yield of epoxygenase products. Interestingly, the amount of total cell epoxygenase products (EETs + DHETs) was higher at 4 h than at 24 h (36 versus 24 ng/mg, respectively), suggesting that depletion of the precursor arachidonic acid and further metabolism (i.e. β-oxidization) could account for these changes (17Spector A.A. Fang X. Snyder G.D. Weintraub N.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Furthermore, within the first 4 h, ∼80% of the EETs (∼3.6 ng/mg), and >95% of the DHETs (∼30 ng/mg) formed were secreted into the medium. In contrast, after 24 h the EETs were found exclusively in the cells (∼1.3 ng/mg), whereas most of the DHETs formed (95% of the total; ∼20 ng/mg) were secreted into the culture medium. These results identify the release of arachidonic acid from glycerophospholipid stores, catalyzed by phospholipases A2 and epoxide hydrolase(s)-mediated hydration (31Chacos N. Capdevila J. Falck J.R.

Biophys. 1983; 223: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) as two key components of the cellular mechanisms controlling EET biosynthesis, disposition, intracellular concentrations, and, ultimately, biological activity (12Capdevila J.H.

Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of EETs by cultured and freshly isolated endothelial cells, and the role of hydration in cellular EET metabolism have been reported (17Spector A.A. Fang X. Snyder G.D. Weintraub N.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 55-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Several members of the CYP2C P450 gene subfamily have been identified as the predominant arachidonic acid epoxygenases in several organ tissues (12Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Harris R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 163-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and CY2C23, 2C11, 2C8, and 2C9 are characterized as renal and vascular epoxygenases in rat and human tissues (12Capdevila J.H.

https://openalex.org/W1974064196,"Proline oxidase is a p53-induced redox gene that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediate apoptosis in tumor cells. We report that proline oxidase is a downstream effector in p53-mediated activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin in lung, renal, colon, and ovarian carcinoma cells. The activation of calcineurin by p53 and proline oxidase was detected by activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), an established indicator of activated calcineurin. Both proline oxidase- and p53-induced activation of NFAT were sensitive to the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK-506, to scavengers of ROS, and to inhibitors of calcium mobilization. A proline oxidase antisense vector suppressed the ability of p53 to up-regulate proline oxidase, activate calcineurin, and induce apoptosis. Moreover, two renal carcinoma-derived mutant p53 proteins were deficient in inducing proline oxidase expression and in activating calcineurin. Inhibitors of calcineurin and calcium mobilization abolished proline oxidase-mediated apoptosis and reduced p53-induced apoptosis. Treatment of colon and ovarian carcinoma cells with the anticancer genotoxic agent etoposide up-regulated both p53 and proline oxidase, activated calcineurin, and induced apoptosis. The etoposide-mediated activation of calcineurin and induction of apoptosis was markedly suppressed by FK-506 calcineurin inhibitor. We propose that proline oxidase mediates apoptosis through the generation of proline-dependent ROS, which then mobilize calcium and activate calcineurin. The activation of calcineurin-regulated transcription factor pathways by proline oxidase might affect gene expression events important to p53 regulation of cell growth and apoptosis.

The activation of calcineurin-regulated transcription factor pathways by proline oxidase might affect gene expression events important to p53 regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. The p53 protein maintains the genomic stability of cells and reduces the probability that an individual will develop cancer. Loss of p53 function is frequently associated with a broad spectrum of human cancers (1Bennett W.P. Hussain S.P. Vahakangas K.H. Khan M.A. Shields P.G. Harris C.C. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and transgenic mice lacking p53 are inherently predisposed to tumors at a young age (2Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). The p53 protein functions as a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor that can activate genes whose promoters contain a p53 response element (reviewed in Refs. 3El-Deiry W.S.

Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A number of genes involved in control of the cell cycle and apoptosis are regulated by p53. By using the SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) technique to evaluate the patterns of gene expression following p53 expression, a series of p53-induced genes (PIGs) 1The abbreviations used are: PIG, p53-induced gene; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; CsA, cyclosporin A; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; Np53, normal p53; POX, proline oxidase; ROS, reactive oxygen species. have been identified that are predicted to encode proteins that could generate or respond to oxidative stress (10Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar). Some PIGs encode factors that induce the intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of ROS, in turn, may sensitize cells to stress and, thus, induce apoptosis. The PIG3 product is closely related to oxidoreductases and has been implicated in regulating the stability of p53, potentially as a result of controlling the intracellular redox state (11Asher G. Lotem J. Cohen B. Sachs L. Shaul Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The PIG6 (proline oxidase-1) gene can generate ROS and induce apoptosis in renal, colon, and lung carcinoma cells (12Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9784-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Lack of expression of PIG6 in two primary renal carcinomas was associated with mutated p53s, which were considerably less effective in up-regulating the PIG6 gene relative to the normal p53 protein (14Maxwell S.A. Rivera A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9784-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Additional evidence implicating a direct role for redox enzymes in p53-mediated apoptosis is derived from a study of a p53 mutant (p53Δ62-91) deleted in the proline-rich domain (amino acids 62-91) that can mediate growth arrest but not apoptosis (16Sakamuro D. Sabbatini P. White E. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 17Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The inability of p53Δ62-91 to induce apoptosis correlated with a selective defect in transcriptional activation. Although p53Δ62-91 activates the p21 promoter and many other p53-responsive promoters, its ability to activate a transiently transfected PIG3 promoter (18Venot C. Maratrat M. Dureuil C. Conseiller E. Bracco L. Debussche L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4668-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and the expression of endogenous PIG3, PIG6, and PIG11 turned out to be severely reduced (19Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Some tumor-derived mutations within the DNA binding domain of p53 result in a phenotype resembling p53Δ62-91 (20Roth J. Koch P. Contente A. Dobbelstein M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1834-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This correlation further supports the model (10Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar) that PIGs are mediators of p53-induced apoptosis. ROS play roles as intracellular second messengers in signaling cascades and induce gene expression by stimulating signal transduction components such as Ca2+ signaling/mobilization and protein phosphorylation (21Torres M.

Because ROS can mobilize Ca2+ and proline oxidase can generate proline-dependent ROS, we decided to investigate whether proline oxidase could activate the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor, which is regulated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent calcineurin (26Hogan P.G.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Calcineurin, also known as protein phosphatase 2B, is a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase activated by Ca2+/calmodulin (28Aramburu J. Rao A. Klee C.B. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 237-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). When activated by Ca2+, calcineurin dephosphorylates the NFAT transcription factor complex (28Aramburu J. Rao A. Klee C.B. Curr.

Cell. 1999; 109: S67-S79Google Scholar) where it regulates genes whose promoters contain NFAT binding sites, including genes encoding interleukin-2, interleukin-3, interleukin-4, FasL, and inositol 1,4,5,-triphosphate receptor type 1 (31Graef I.A. Chen F. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). NFAT was originally described as a transcription factor expressed in activated but not resting T cells (32Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 33Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, NFAT is now known to be expressed in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, testis, placenta, pancreas, small intestine, prostate, colon, ovary, and kidney (31Graef I.A. Chen F. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). NFATs are ubiquitously expressed as a family of five transcription factors (NFATC1-C5), which control gene expression influencing the development and adaptation of numerous nonimmune mammalian cell types (reviewed in Ref. 27Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). NFATC2, NFATC3, and NFATC4 have been implicated in playing a role in apoptosis (34Youn H.D. Chatila T.A.

We show here that calcineurin is activated in nonsmall cell lung, ovarian, and colon carcinoma cells by p53 through the induction of the expression of proline oxidase (POX). Two renal carcinoma-derived p53 mutants were defective in up-regulating POX and activating NFAT. Additional evidence for a direct role for POX in the p53-mediated activation of calcineurin was provided by POX antisense experiments. Calcium chelators, ROS scavengers, and inhibitors of calcineurin suppressed both p53- and POX-induced apoptosis and activation of NFAT. Treatment of cells with the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agent etoposide induced p53 and POX and activated calcineurin. Inhibition of calcineurin and repression of POX expression markedly suppressed etoposide-induced apoptosis. The results implicate POX-mediated activation of calcineurin as a novel downstream pathway in p53-induced apoptosis. Cell Lines—H1299 nonsmall cell lung, TOV-21G ovarian, and DLD1 colon adenocarcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection. H1299 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. TOV-21G cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of MCDB 105 medium (Sigma) and medium 199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. DLD1 cells were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Calcium and ROS Modifiers—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A and FK-506 were dissolved in Me2SO and ethanol, respectively. The hydroxyl radical scavengers benzoate and dimethylthiourea, the H2O2 scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and the calmodulin agonist trifluoperazine were dissolved in water. The cell-permeable calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, and etoposide were solubilized in Me2SO. Antibodies, Expression Plasmids, and Recombinant Adenoviruses—The p53 monoclonal antibody Bp53-12 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the actin monoclonal antibody (N350) was from Amersham Biosciences. A POX antibody (T338) was generated in rabbits against a synthetic peptide composed of amino acids 254-269 of the POX protein (TGQLEPLLSRFTEEEE) (14Maxwell S.A. Rivera A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9784-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Kidney p53 cDNAs isolated by reverse transcription PCR from primary kidney tissues were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 ECHO expression system (Invitrogen). The complete POX cDNA was cloned into the pAdtrack vector, which coexpresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a normalization control for transfection efficiency (14Maxwell S.A. Rivera A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9784-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The pAdtrack-POX vector was used to generate a recombinant adenovirus using a simplified procedure as described previously (38He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The POX and a wild type p53 recombinant adenovirus were amplified in 293 cells and isolated by freeze-thawing 293 cells in phosphate-buffered saline. A NFAT luciferase reporter plasmid (3xNFAT-Luc) and an expression plasmid encoding GFP-VIVIT, a specific inhibitor of NFAT, have been described previously (39Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Western Blotting—Adenovirus infections and Lipofectamine-mediated transfections were conducted as described previously (14Maxwell S.A. Rivera A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9784-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, for gene transfections a T75 flask of confluent cells was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 7 ml of Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10-15 μg of DNA and 18 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfection medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the cells were incubated for 24-36 h to allow expression of the transfected gene. To normalize for transfection efficiency, pAdtrack, which expresses GFP, was included in the transfection assay where appropriate. For adenovirus infections, cells were incubated in complete cell culture medium containing 50 plaque-forming units of adenovirus per cell for 24-42 h. Western blotting was performed using the SuperSignal immunodetection system (Pierce Chemical) as described previously (14Maxwell S.A. Rivera A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9784-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). NFAT-Luciferase Reporter Assay—Luciferase reporter gene assays were performed in 12-well culture dishes. Cells (1.6 × 104/well) were transfected with 1 μg of NFAT luciferase reporter gene and 1 μg of each expression vector or infected with 50 plaque-forming units/cell with recombinant adenovirus, as described above. After a 24-h incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and luciferase activity was assayed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). To normalize for transfection efficiency, a β-galactosidase reporter vector was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). All experiments were repeated at least three times with different cell preparations. To determine the effect of different calcium and ROS modifiers on NFAT activation by p53 or POX, cells were cotransfected with NFAT and β-galactosidase reporter vectors and with GFP, p53, or POX recombinant adenoviruses for 18 h. The calcineurin inhibitors, ROS squelchers, and calcium modifiers were added to the cell medium at the time of p53 or POX adenovirus infection. Cells were then incubated in the presence of adenovirus and drugs for the designated amount of time. Dose-response curves were performed for each of the drugs to determine the amount required to induce 50-70% cell death after 36 h. ELISA Apoptosis Assay—The Cell Death Detection ELISA system (Roche Applied Science) is a photometric enzyme immunoassay for the quantitative in vitro determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes) after induced apoptotic cell death. Briefly, transfection of H1299 cells with GFP-VIVIT was performed 5 h before infection with GFP, p53, or POX recombinant adenoviruses. The calcineurin inhibitors, the hydroxyl radical scavengers, the H2O2 scavenger, the cell-permeable calcium chelator, the calcium channel blocker, and the calmodulin agonist mentioned above were added to the cell medium simultaneously with p53 or POX adenovirus infection for 36 h. Cell lysates were prepared according the manufacturer's specifications and placed into a streptavidin-coated microplate along with a mixture of biotinylated anti-histone (binds to histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 from various species, e.g. man, mouse, rat. hamster, cow, opossum, and Xenopus) and anti-DNA covalently linked to peroxidase (reacts with single- and double-stranded DNA). The biotinylated anti-histone antibody binds to the histone-component of the nucleosomes, and the biotinylated antibody-histone immunocomplex is captured by binding to the streptavidin-coated microplate. Finally, the peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody reacts with the DNA-component of the nucleosomes. Unbound components (antibodies) were removed by a washing step. Quantitative determination of the amount of nucleosomes was determined photometrically using the peroxidase substrate 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), at 405 nm. p53 and POX Activate NFAT through ROS- and Calcium-sensitive Pathways—ROS can mobilize Ca2+, which activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. The dephosphorylation of NFAT by activated calcineurin results in its translocation into the nucleus, where it activates genes containing NFAT response elements. Because p53 can generate ROS through the induction of POX, we investigated whether p53 and POX could increase NFAT activity, a biochemical indicator of activated calcineurin. We examined the activity of NFAT by using the 3xNFAT-luciferase reporter gene under control of three NFAT response elements in H1299 p53-null cells up-regulated for normal p53 (Np53). As shown in Fig. 1A, up-regulation of Np53 induced significant activation of the NFAT reporter gene (∼7-8-fold) when compared with the activity measured in cells transfected with GFP, indicating that the NFAT transcription factor had been activated in response to up-regulation of p53. We next compared the ability of two renal carcinoma-derived mutant p53s, T4p53 and T7p53, for their ability to activate NFAT. The T4p53 contains a double transition mutation at amino acid residues 125 (A125T) and 193 (R193H), and T7p53 harbors a single transition mutation at amino acid 149 (S149F). Even though both the T4p53 protein and the T7p53 protein were expressed at much higher levels in H1299 cells than Np53 (Fig. 1B), they were considerably less capable of activating NFAT than Np53 (Fig. 1A). Both mutant p53s were also less capable of inducing the POX protein than the Np53, with the T4p53 being the most defective in this respect (Fig. 1B). The level of NFAT activation correlated closely with the differential abilities of mutant and normal p53s to up-regulate POX (Fig. 1B). Because the activation of NFAT is a biochemical indicator for activated calcineurin, the close correlation of the deficient abilities of two mutant p53s to induce POX expression with their lower capabilities to activate NFAT suggested a direct role for POX in p53-mediated activation of calcineurin. Over one-half of all human cancers contain missense p53 mutations, and ∼80% of these mutations localize to the DNA binding domain. Many of these mutants lose the ability to bind DNA and activate transcription, rendering them incompetent to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Overexpression experiments in cell cultures have suggested that missense p53 mutations represent dominant negative phenotypes. p53 mutations in the core domain are classified into two types (40Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Mutations such as those at the mutational hotspots Arg-248 and Arg-273 occur in the DNA contact areas on either the L3 loop or the nearby loop-sheet-helix motif of p53 and are termed class I mutations. Class II mutations, such as those at Arg-175, occur in areas important for the conformational stability of p53 protein, such as the L2 loop in the zinc region, leading to conformational changes that expose the mutant-specific epitope of the PAb240 antibody and result in the loss the wild-type-specific epitope detected by PAb1620. In a number of experimental systems the conformational mutants were shown to be more oncogenic than the DNA-binding mutants. We predicted that the T4 and T7 represent conformational mutants of p53, because the mutations in the T4 mutant (A125T and A193H) and T7 mutant (S149F) fall in regions that are not directly involved in DNA binding. However, the A125T mutation in the T4 mutant does fall in somewhat close proximity to Lys-120, which is located in the loop 1 region forming the major groove DNA contact. We thus investigated the ability of the T4 and T7 mutants to act as dominant negatives of normal p53 activation of the NFAT reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 1C, coexpression of either the T4 or the T7 mutant p53 with normal p53 (Np53 T4 and Np53 T7) resulted in significant repression of the ability of Np53 to activate NFAT. The T4 double mutant proved most effective in dominant negative activity against Np53 and was also able to repress the residual activation of NFAT by the weaker T7 mutant (T4 T7 in Fig. 1C). The dominant negative activities of these mutants on normal p53 activation of NFAT correlated well with their reduced abilities to induce POX expression. We are currently exploring further the conformational phenotypes of the T4 and T7 mutants and their potential dominant negative effects on the ability of normal p53 to induce apoptosis. To further explore the role of POX in p53-mediated activation of calcineurin, we investigated whether POX could directly induce the activation of NFAT in H1299 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, infection of H1299 cells with a POX adenovirus led to high activity of the NFAT luciferase reporter gene relative to control cells infected with a GFP adenovirus. To determine the specificity of our assay with respect to activation of NFAT, we added a specific peptide inhibitor of NFAT in the POX and p53 NFAT reporter assays. The peptide, VIVIT, inhibits NFAT activation and NFAT-dependent expression of endogenous cytokine genes in T cells without affecting the expression of other cytokines that require calcineurin but not NFAT (39Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The repression of POX- and p53-induced activation of the NFAT reporter gene by the specific NFAT peptide inhibitor VIVIT (Fig. 2, A and B) indicated that activated NFAT and not some other factor that spuriously activated the NFAT reporter gene in H1299 cells was detected by our assays. Both p53-induced activation and POX-induced activation of NFAT were sensitive to the well characterized calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK-506, (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating a role for calcineurin in POX- and p53-induced activation of NFAT. Up-regulation of POX can generate increases in proline-dependent ROS production (13Donald S.P. Sun X.Y. Hu C.A. Yu J. Mei J.M. Valle D. Phang J.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1810-1815PubMed Google Scholar, 14Maxwell S.A. Rivera A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9784-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Liu Y.

ROS act as intracellular second messengers in signaling cascades and influence gene expression by stimulating signal transduction components such as Ca2+ signaling. To determine whether the p53- and POX-mediated activation of NFAT was sensitive to ROS and calcium, we treated cells up-regulated for p53 and POX with various calcium and ROS modifiers. H1299 cells were first transfected with the NFAT reporter gene followed by infection with GFP, POX, or p53 adenoviruses for 24 h in the presence of a particular ROS or calcium modifier. The hydroxyl radical scavengers benzoate (Fig. 2, A and B, BZO) (41Das D. Bandyopahdyay D. Bhattacharjee M. Banerjee R.K. Free Radic. Biol.

The N-acetyl-1-cysteine scavenger proved to be the most effective inhibitor of both POX- and p53-induced NFAT activation. The calcium channel blocker nifedipine (Fig. 2, A and B, NFDP) (44Huang C.

Siegel E. Sharp G.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1980; 66: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were also effective inhibitors. Western blotting, as well as a visual analysis of GFP fluorescence, showed that each of these agents had little effect on adenovirus infection and transgene expression, because the induction of p53 expression was equivalent in both control and drug-treated cells (Fig. 2C). These data suggested a dependence of the p53- and POX-induced activation of NFAT on ROS- and calcium-signaling pathways. The results also suggested that POX is a primary mediator of the p53-induced activation of NFAT, because the degrees of inhibition by the drugs on POX-induced activation of NFAT were similar to those observed for p53. A POX antisense expression experiment confirmed a role for POX in p53-mediated activation of NFAT. As shown in Fig. 3, coexpression of a POX antisense"
https://openalex.org/W1971083012,"The Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junction (NMJ) contains three pharmacologically distinct ionotropic receptors: γ-aminobutyric acid receptors, levamisole-sensitive nicotinic receptors, and levamisole-insensitive nicotinic receptors. The subunit compositions of the γ-aminobutyric acid- and levamisole-sensitive receptors have been elucidated, but the levamisole-insensitive acetylcholine receptor is uncharacterized. To determine which of the ∼40 putative nicotinic receptor subunit genes in the C. elegans genome encodes the levamisole-resistant receptor, we utilized MAPCeL, a microarray profiling strategy. Of seven nicotinic receptor subunit transcripts found to be enriched in muscle, five encode the levamisole receptor subunits, leaving two candidates for the levamisole-insensitive receptor: acr-8 and acr-16. Electrophysiological analysis of the acr-16 deletion mutant showed that the levamisole-insensitive muscle acetylcholine current was eliminated, whereas deletion of acr-8 had no effect. These data suggest that ACR-16, like its closest vertebrate homolog, the nicotinic receptor α7-subunit, may form homomeric receptors in vivo. Genetic ablation of both the levamisole-sensitive receptor and acr-16 abolished all cholinergic synaptic currents at the NMJ and severely impaired C. elegans locomotion. Therefore, ACR-16-containing receptors account for all non-levamisole-sensitive nicotinic synaptic signaling at the C. elegans NMJ.

The determination of subunit composition for all three C. elegans body wall muscle ionotropic receptors provides a critical foundation for future research at this tractable model synapse. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are a family of highly conserved pentameric channels used extensively in both vertebrate and invertebrate neurotransmission. These receptors have been implicated in memory formation, nociception, and nicotine addiction as well as in various neuronal disorders such as Parkinson disease and epilepsy (1Gotti C. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 363-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Most organisms express multiple nicotinic receptor subunits that combine to form receptors with diverse biophysical and pharmacological properties (2Millar N.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), based largely on receptor composition. The molecular mechanisms controlling nicotinic receptor subunit composition, assembly, trafficking, and localization remain to be fully elucidated. One approach to this question is the application of molecular genetics to the simple organism Caenorhabditis elegans (3Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lewis J.A. Wu C.H. Berg H. Levine J.H. Genetics. 1980; 95: 905-928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Individual C. elegans body wall muscles have both cholinergic and GABAergic inputs, which trigger contraction and relaxation, respectively. A single gene (unc-49) encodes the ionotropic GABA receptors present at the C. elegans NMJ (8Bamber B.A. Beg A.A. Twyman R.E. Jorgensen E.M. J.

Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied class is activated by the nematode-specific acetylcholine receptor (AChR) agonist levamisole (4Lewis J.A. Wu C.H. Berg H. Levine J.H.

Studies of the assembly, trafficking, and localization of C. elegans levamisole-sensitive receptors have provided significant insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate this receptor (14Kim J.

Nature. 2004; 431: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The second class of nicotinic receptor at the NMJ is levamisole-insensitive, and its subunit composition is unknown. Because this receptor class accounts for a major component of the synaptic response at the C. elegans NMJ, identifying the subunit composition is important for future studies that utilize this accessible model synapse. However, the C. elegans genome contains at least 40 genes that have sequence similarity to nicotinic receptor subunits (19Bargmann C.I. Science. 1998; 282: 2028-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), of which 27 appear to be authentic (20Mongan N.P. Baylis H.A. Adcock C. Smith G.R. Sansom M.S. Sattelle D.B. Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 213-228PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to identify the genes that encode the levamisole-insensitive nicotinic receptor subunits, we adopted a recently developed microarray profiling strategy, MAPCeL (micro-array profiling of C. elegans cells) (21Fox R.M. Von Stetina S.E. Barlow S.J. Shaffer C. Olszewski K.L. Moore J.H. Dupuy D. Vidal M. Miller III, D.M. BMC Genomics 2005. 2005; 6: 42Google Scholar). In summary, the microarray screen identified ACR-16, a nicotinic receptor α7-like subunit, which we confirmed by electrophysiological and genetic approaches to be an essential subunit of the non-levamisole receptor at the C. elegans NMJ. Nematode strains were maintained at 20–25 °C using standard culture methods (3Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strains used in these studies were the wild-type Bristol isolate N2, DP38:unc-119(ed3) III, myo-3::GFP pPD4251- (ccOS4251) I (22Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar), pacr-8::GFP (NC752(wdEx263), NC753(wdEx264)), pacr-16::GFP (NC971(wdEx418), NC972(wdEx419)), ZZ37:unc-63(x37) I, CB407:unc-49(e407) III, RB918:acr-16(ok789) V, and pmyo-3::ACR-16 (SY1023(jaEx1023)). The double mutants SY1024:unc-63(x37);acr-16(ok789), SY1025:unc-49(e407) III;acr-16(ok789) V, and SY1026:unc-63(x37) I;unc-49(e407) III and the triple mutant SY1027:unc-63(x37); unc-49(e407);acr-16(ok789) were generated using standard genetic techniques. Detailed descriptions of MAPCeL, including C. elegans cell culture, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and the microarray methods used in this work, are provided in Ref. 21Fox R.M.

Primary in vitro cultures of C. elegans embryonic cells were established as described previously (23Christensen M. Estevez A. Yin X. Fox R. Morrison R. McDonnell M. Gleason C. Miller III, D.M. Strange K. Neuron. 2002; 33: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), with the exception that cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated surfaces to ease removal for FACS. myo-3::GFP-labeled cells were isolated by FACS after 24 h in culture. Sorting experiments were performed in a FACStar Plus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Nonviable cells were excluded by labeling with propidium iodide. Sorting gates were empirically established to achieve ∼90% enrichment of myo-3::GFP-labeled muscle cells. 100 ng of RNA from myo-3::GFP cells (micro-RNA isolation kit, Stratagene) was amplified and labeled using the Affymetrix GeneChip eucaryotic small sample target labeling protocol with modifications as described previously (21Fox R.M. Von Stetina S.E. Barlow S.J. Shaffer C. Olszewski K.L. Moore J.H. Dupuy D. Vidal M. Miller III, D.M. BMC Genomics 2005. 2005; 6: 42Google Scholar). The Affymetrix C. elegans GeneChip array was hybridized with 15 μg of labeled mRNA. myo-3::GFP cells were profiled in triplicate. Reference microarray data were obtained from four independent experiments with 24-h cultures of all embryonic cells (from the wild type, N2) after sorting to exclude nonviable cells. Affymetrix hybridization signals were scaled in comparison with a global average value (24Hill A.A. Brown E.L. Whitley M.Z. Tucker-Kellogg G. Hunter C.P. Slonim D.K. Genome Biology. 2001; (http://genomebiology.com/2001/2/12/research/0055)PubMed Google Scholar). To detect enriched mRNAs, intensity values were normalized by RMA (robust multi-array) analysis and statistically analyzed using SAM (significance analysis of microarrays) software (Stanford University). Muscle enriched AChR subunit transcripts are defined as AChR genes that are ≥1.7-fold elevated versus average expression in all cells at a false discovery rate of ≤1.2%. A comprehensive analysis of the muscle microarray data will be described elsewhere. 2R. M. Fox, S. E. Von Stetina, K. L. Olszewski, J. McDermott, T. Brodigan, W. C. Spencer, M. Krause, D. M. Miller III, manuscript in preparation. pacr-8::GFP—A region 2460 bp upstream of the ATG start site was generated by PCR using with primers acr-8p1 (5′-AAGCTTTGTCAGTCTCTACGATTAC-3′) and acr-8p2 (5′-GGATCCGATGAAGCTGGAGTGAGAAG-3′). The acr-8 PCR fragment and an unc-119 minigene (from plasmid pPD#MM051) (25Maduro M. Pilgrim D. Genetics. 1995; 141: 977-988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were subcloned into the GFP vector pPD95.75 to produce vector acr-8::GFP-unc-119. Four independent acr-8::GFP transgenic lines were generated by microparticle bombardment with the acr-8::GFP-unc-119 plasmid into unc-119(ed3) animals. pacr-16::GFP—GFP reporters were generated using overlap PCR (26Hobert O. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification of the GFP fragment have been described by Hobert (26Hobert O. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 728-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). A region extending from 3000 bp upstream of the acr-16 start site to 24 bp into exon 1 was PCR-amplified with primers acr-16p1 (5′-CACCCTTGTGTGTCTGTGAAG-3′) and acr-16p3GFP (5′-AGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTGCGCACGAGATGAGAAG-3′). 15 μl of PCR product was co-injected with 25 ng/μl plasmid pRF4 (rol-6). Five independent lines of acr-16::GFP were generated. Images of GFP reporter expression were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. Cultured embryonic cells were photographed using a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope. For Pmyo-3::acr-16 genomic DNA fusion, PCR was used to isolate the genomic version of acr-16. The sequence of the 5′-end PCR primer was aggatccATTCTCATGTCCGTATGTCTG, and the sequence of the 3′-end PCR primer was aggtaccCATTAGGCGACAAGATACGGTG. BamHI and KpnI sites were introduced into the 5′- and 3′-end primers, respectively, for subsequent cloning. The PCR product was cloned into pPD96.52 downstream of the myo-3 promoter. The final product was purified using a QIAprep spin mini prep kit and injected into the gonads of acr-16(ok789) mutants at a concentration of 5 μg/ml along with pmyo-3::GFP (20 μg/ml) as a co-injection marker. Five independent lines were generated. Rescue of the ACR-16 body wall muscle cholinergic response was assessed electrophysiologically. Break points in acr-8(ok1240) were identified using the following primer pair: CACCAGGCAAGTTGAGTGAA and ACTCAGCCAACATCGTTTCC. The same primers were used for sequencing. Break points in acr-16(ok789) after a 2× outcross, identified by the C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium, were confirmed using the following primer pair: CAACTGGCTTGGTGCATTGG and TGTCATGTCGAGACCGGTTA. PCR products were cloned and sequenced with the same primer pairs at the University of Illinois Sequencing Facility. Behavioral assays were conducted on N2 and the acr-16(ok789), unc-63(x13), and unc-63(x13);acr-16(ok789) mutants. Thrashing behavior (27Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D.

Locomotion was scored for individual worms placed on an agar plate without a bacterial lawn and allowed to acclimatize for 1 min. The subsequent body bends were counted for the following minute. Head tap assays were also performed on worms acclimatized for 5 min on agar plates lacking bacterial lawns. An eyelash was used to gently tap the worm on the head, and the total number of elicited body bends was counted. Worms were filmed to ensure accurate scoring of body bends. A body bend is described as the movement in which the head of the worm completes a full sinusoid. Body wall muscle recordings were obtained from dissected worms as described previously (6Richmond J.E. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Briefly, worms were immobilized using a cyanoacrylic glue, and the cuticle was cut open longitudinally, exposing body wall muscles that were treated with collagenase to remove the basement membrane. Anterior ventral medial muscles were whole cell voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -60 mV using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Instruments Inc.). The extracellular solution consisted of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm sucrose, and mm 15 HEPES (pH 7.3; ∼330 mosm). The patch pipette was filled with 120 mm KCl, 20 mm KOH, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm TES, 0.25 mm CaCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 36 mm sucrose, and 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.2; ∼315 mosm). Ligand applications (acetylcholine (ACh) and levamisole) were applied to voltage-clamped muscles via a pressure-ejection electrode. Evoked synaptic responses were obtained by depolarizing the ventral nerve cord using a stimulating electrode placed anterior to the body wall muscle as described previously (28Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis was carried out using Pulsefit (HEKA Instruments Inc.) and Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft, Inc.) and graphed using IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc.). All statistically derived values obtained using In-Stat (GraphPad Software) are given as means ± S.E. Microarray Experiments Identify Muscle Nicotinic AChR Subunit Genes—We used a new microarray technology, MAP-CeL (21Fox R.M. Von Stetina S.E. Barlow S.J. Shaffer C. Olszewski K.L. Moore J.H. Dupuy D. Vidal M. Miller III, D.M. BMC Genomics 2005. 2005; 6: 42Google Scholar), to identify nicotinic receptor subunits preferentially expressed in body wall muscles. Muscle cells, labeled with the myo-3::GFP reporter gene, were obtained from in vitro cultures of C. elegans embryonic cells (Fig. 1). We have shown previously that myo-3::GFP cells differentiate in culture, display a spindle-shaped morphology resembling the body wall muscle cells in vivo, express muscle-specific genes, and exhibit largely normal physiological properties (23Christensen M. Estevez A. Yin X. Fox R. Morrison R. McDonnell M. Gleason C. Miller III, D.M. Strange K. Neuron. 2002; 33: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In culture, myo-3::GFP cells constitute ∼15% of all cells, which is comparable with their frequency in vivo (81 body muscle cells/550 total embryonic cells = 15%) (23Christensen M. Estevez A. Yin X. Fox R. Morrison R. McDonnell M. Gleason C. Miller III, D.M. Strange K. Neuron. 2002; 33: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We used FACS to enrich myo-3::GFP cells to ∼90% (Fig. 2). mRNAs from these cells were amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the C. elegans Affymetrix GeneChip array. To identify the subset of genes specifically enriched in body muscle cells, we compared these results with microarray data obtained from all embryonic cells. A total of 945 genes from cultured myo-3::GFP cells were detected at or above a threshold of 1.7-fold enrichment versus an average expression level in all cells.2 Here, we focused on the nicotinic AChR subunit genes in the muscle enriched data set. As shown in Table I, we detected transcripts encoding all five of the known components of the levamisole-sensitive AChR, i.e. unc-29, unc-38, unc-63, lev-1, and lev-8. Two additional transcripts, acr-8 and acr-16, were also enriched.Fig. 2FACS isolation of GFP-labeled body wall muscle cells. A, shown is a fluorescence scatter plot of wild-type (non-GFP) cells. Propidium iodide (PI)-labeled cells are shown in red. The sorting gate in the lower right-hand corner excludes autofluorescent gut cells in the GFP channel. B, shown is a fluorescence scatter plot of cultured cells from myo-3::GFP embryos. Note the abundant GFP-labeled cells (green). C, GFP-positive cells were also gated within the circumscribed area (purple) to exclude large cell clumps and small debris. D, embryonic cells are shown after 24 h in culture and prior to FACS.

Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholarf GFP expression data in this work Open table in a new tab To confirm expression of ACR-8 and ACR-16 in body wall muscles, we generated transgenic lines with acr-8::GFP and acr-16::GFP fusions. In both cases, we detected GFP signals in body wall muscles (Fig. 3). acr-8::GFP was strongly expressed in all body muscle cells as well as in anal and vulval muscles and ventral cord motor neurons (Fig. 3A). acr-16::GFP was detected in all body wall muscle cells (but not vulval or anal muscles) and was also present in a subset of neurons, notably the DB motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord (Fig. 3, B and C). Expression of both acr-8::GFP and acr-16::GFP was visible in the embryo. The AChR α7-Like Subunit ACR-16 Is Expressed in Body Wall Muscle and Contributes to the Synaptic Response—Based on the microarray data and expression patterns, we considered ACR-8 and ACR-16 to be potential subunits of the body wall muscle AChRs. To determine whether either of these subunits contributes to the levamisole-insensitive channel, we obtained deletion mutants of acr-8(ok1240) and acr-16(ok789) from the C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium. The deletion break points and predicted protein disruption of acr-8(ok1240) and acr-16(ok789) are shown in Fig. 4. To establish whether ACR-8 or ACR-16 contributes to the ACh response of the body wall muscles, we compared the ACh (5 × 10-4 m) response amplitudes of voltage-clamped body wall muscles in acr-8 and acr-16 mutants with that in the wild type. acr-8(ok1240) mutants exhibited wild-type responses to ACh (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the ACh response of acr-16(ok789) was reduced by 85% compared with that of the wild type (284 ± 29 pA (n = 9) for acr-16(ok789) versus 1898 ± 206 pA (n = 7) for N2; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 5A). To examine whether the levamisole receptors were affected in acr-16(ok789) mutants, we recorded muscle levamisole responses. Levamisole-induced currents in acr-16(ok789) mutants were, however, indistinguishable from those in the wild type (Fig. 5B). This result suggests that ACR-16 is a required component of the levamisole-insensitive AChR in the ventral body wall muscles. Because acr-8(ok1240) mutants showed no reduction in either ACh or levamisole responses, ACR-8 is unlikely to contribute to either of the two electrophysiologically identified AChR classes in body muscle. To determine the extent to which ACR-16 contributes to the synaptic response at the NMJ, we recorded evoked responses in acr-16(ok789) mutants. The evoked response was reduced by 83% in acr-16(ok789) mutants compared with wild-type worms (Fig. 6A), indicating that ACR-16 is present at postsynaptic sites and contributes to the synaptic response of the body wall muscles. To confirm that the defects observed in acr-16(ok789) mutants are specifically due to loss of ACR-16 in body wall muscles, we expressed acr-16 genomic DNA fused to the muscle-specific promoter Pmyo-3 along with a Pmyo-3::GFP co-injection marker in acr-16(ok789) mutants. Transgenic lines were generated in which the expression of ACR-16 and the GFP co-injection marker was mosaic. Muscle cells that inherited the acr-16 rescuing construct could then be detected as GFP-positive cells. GFP-fluorescing muscles exhibited robust responses to both pressure-ejected ACh (Fig. 6B, right trace) and evoked stimulation (Fig. 6C, right trace), whereas non-fluorescing cells showed responses typical of acr-16(ok789) mutants (Fig. 6, B and C, left traces). These data indicate that the reduced muscle ACh and evoked responses of acr-16(ok789) mutants are due to the deletion of the acr-16 gene locus in muscles and rule out the possibility that a background mutation in the acr-16(ok789) strain produced the electrophysiological phenotype. ACR-16 Is an Essential Subunit of the Body Wall Muscle Levamisole-resistant Nicotinic AChR—The ACh and levamisole current amplitudes of acr-16(ok789) mutants are very similar (285 ± 25 pA (n = 10) for ACh versus 243 ± 35 pA (n = 6) for levamisole), suggesting that, in acr-16 mutants, only the levamisole-sensitive receptors are still functional. To test this hypothesis, we generated unc-63(x37);acr-16(ok789) double mutants. unc-63 encodes an essential α-subunit of the levamisole-sensitive receptor; we have shown previously that the levamisole response is abolished in unc-63(x37) mutants (12Culetto E. Baylis H.A. Richmond J.E. Jones A.K. Fleming J.T. Squire M.D. Lewis J.A. Sattelle D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42476-42483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The muscle ACh current in unc-63(x37);acr-16(ok789) double mutants was eliminated (Fig. 7A). Therefore, we can conclude that the nicotinic receptors on body wall muscle activated by pressure-ejected ACh contain either UNC-63 (levamisole-sensitive) or ACR-16 (levamisole-insensitive) subunits. Thus, unc-63(x37) and acr-16(ok789) mutants can be used to genetically isolate the two muscle AChR subtypes. We have shown previously that, in the absence of levamisole-sensitive AChRs, desensitization of the remaining muscle ACh response is faster, suggesting that the two receptor subtypes have different kinetic properties (12Culetto E. Baylis H.A. Richmond J.E. Jones A.K. Fleming J.T. Squire M.D. Lewis J.A. Sattelle D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42476-42483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We confirmed this observation by examining the rates of desensitization to 1-s ACh pulses in unc-63(x37) and acr-16(ok789) mutant muscles. The levamisole-sensitive receptors present in acr-16(ok789) mutants were shown to desensitize at a much slower rate than the levamisole-insensitive receptors present in unc-63 mutants (Fig. 7B). Together, these data indicate that the two muscle receptor subtypes have different subunit compositions, pharmacology, and kinetics. Exogenous ACh application allowed us to define two classes of nicotinic receptors on the muscle membrane. This analysis did not address whether these two receptors account for all cholinergic synaptic current at the NMJ. To specifically examine the post-synaptic nicotinic receptors, we needed to first isolate the cholinergic synaptic responses from GABAergic synaptic events also present at the C. elegans NMJ. We have shown previously that all GABAergic synaptic currents at the NMJ are eliminated in the GABA receptor null mutant unc-49(e407) (6Richmond J.E. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in unc-49(e407) mutants, all remaining synaptic activity is blocked by the nicotinic receptor antagonist d-tubocurare and is therefore likely to be cholinergic. To examine the contribution of ACR-16-dependent receptors to cholinergic synaptic activity, we generated unc-49(e407);acr-16(ok789) double mutants. unc-49(e407);acr-16(ok789) mutants exhibited prominent reductions in both endogenous and evoked cholinergic transmission at the NMJ (Fig. 8) compared with unc-49(e407) single mutants. We also examined the impact of removing the levamisole-sensitive receptors by making unc-63(x37);unc-49(e407) double mutants. The evoked and endogenous responses were not significantly reduced in unc-63(x37);unc-49(e407) double mutants (Fig. 8) compared with unc-49(e407) alone. To examine whether all cholinergic synaptic activity could be eliminated in the absence of both nicotinic receptor types, we generated unc-63(x37);unc-49(e407); acr-16(ok789) triple mutants. The endogenous miniature synaptic currents and evoked responses were completely abolished in unc-63(x37); unc-49(e407);acr-16(ok789) triple mutants (Fig. 8). Thus, we conclude that, in combination with UNC-63-containing receptors, ACR-16-containing receptors account for all cholinergic ionotropic synaptic responses in these muscles. These data suggest that both levamisole-sensitive and levamisole-insensitive receptors contribute to the excitability of body wall muscles in C. elegans. Therefore, we predict that unc-63(x37);acr-16(ok789) double mutants would have a more severe locomotory defect than the two single mutants. Several behavioral assays were conducted to test this prediction. In all assays, unc-63(x37);acr-16(ok789) double mutants exhibited more severe locomotory defects than unc-63(x37) mutants alone (Fig. 9), demonstrating that both receptors contribute to C. elegans locomotion. Using a newly designed microarray profiling strategy (MAP-CeL) combined with reverse genetics and in situ electrophysiological analysis, we have identified and characterized ACR-16 as an essential subunit of the levamisole-insensitive nicotinic receptor at the C. elegans NMJ. This study highlights the utility of microarray profiling to identify novel genes of interest in C. elegans. In this study, genetic ablation of acr-16 produced no overt behavioral phenotype (Fig. 9). This observation explains why acr-16 mutants have not been isolated in previous genetic screens that selected for uncoordinated or pharmacological phenotypes. By selectively profiling body muscle cells, we narrowed our search for components of the levamisole-insensitive receptor from ∼40 potential subunit genes to only two candidates, acr-8 and acr-16. The acr-8 deletion had no affect on either the levamisole-sensitive or levamisole-insensitive components of the muscle ACh response. Therefore, we ruled out ACR-8 as an essential subunit of either nicotinic receptor class in the ventral body wall muscles assayed in this study. Examination of the pore-forming M2 domain of ACR-8 in which a highly conserved glutamic acid is replaced by histidine suggested that this subunit may actually contribute to an anion-selective channel of yet unknown function (20Mongan N.P. Baylis H.A. Adcock C. Smith G.R. Sansom M.S. Sattelle D.B. Receptors Channels. 1998; 6: 213-228PubMed Google Scholar). This finding left only one remaining candidate, ACR-16, which we have now demonstrated is an essential subunit of the body wall muscle levamisole-insensitive AChR. With the identification of acr-16, we can genetically ablate any of the three neurotransmitter receptor components that contribute to the synaptic readout at the NMJ. Thus, we can now study the physiology and regulation of each receptor class in isolation. Our finding that ACR-16 is the only muscle enriched subunit that is required for levamisole-insensitive nicotinic responses leads to the possibility that ACR-16 assembles into a homomeric receptor in C. elegans body wall muscles. ACR-16 is an α-subunit with 47% homology to the vertebrate nicotinic receptor α7-subunit (29Ballivet M. Alliod C. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The vertebrate α7-subunit is capable of forming functional homomeric nicotinic receptors in several cells, including Xenopus oocytes, PC12 cells, and rat brain (30Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 31Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Drisdel R.C. Green W.N. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 133-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, ACR-16 (previously termed Ce21) has been shown to form functional nicotinic receptors when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (29Ballivet M. Alliod C. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). By identifying ACR-16 as an essential subunit of the body wall muscle levamisole-insensitive receptor, we are now able to directly compare previous heterologous expression data with those of the native ACR-16-containing receptor. The pharmacological profile of heterologously expressed ACR-16 receptors closely resembles that of the native receptor in situ. Specifically, both heterologously expressed and native ACR-16-dependent receptors are activated by nicotine and ACh, but not levamisole, and maximal responses to nicotine are smaller than those to ACh (in situ data not shown), suggesting that nicotine acts as a partial agonist of ACR-16 receptors. Furthermore, both the heterologously expressed and native ACR-16-dependent ACh responses are potently inhibited by dihydro-β-erythroidine (6Richmond J.E. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 29Ballivet M. Alliod C. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that other subunits contribute to the native ACR-16-containing receptor, the present data suggest that ACR-16 may function as a homomeric nicotinic receptor α7-like subunit in the C. elegans body wall muscles. Vertebrate α7-subunit-containing nicotinic receptors are present in diverse areas of the human brain (33Dominguez del Toro E. Juiz J.M. Peng X. Lindstrom J. Criado M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 349: 325-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and are involved in higher cognitive functions, including learning and memory (34Broide R.S. Leslie F.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1999; 20: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 35Levin E.D. J. Neurobiol. 2002; 53: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 36Drago J. McColl C.D. Horne M.K. Finkelstein D.I. Ross S.A. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1267-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alterations in α7-subunit-containing nicotinic receptor signaling have been linked to several neuropathologies, including Parkinson disease and epilepsy (1Gotti C. Clementi F. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 363-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) and Alzheimer disease (37Chu L.W. Ma E.S. Lam K.K. Chan M.F. Lee D.H. Dement. Geriatr. Cogn. Disord. 2005; 19: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). α7-Subunit-containing nicotinic receptors are localized presynaptically and postsynaptically (38Fabian-Fine R. Skehel P. Errington M.L. Davies H.A. Sher E. Stewart M.G. Fine A. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7993-8003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Levy R.B. Aoki C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5001-5015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a variety of synapses, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for this targeted expression remain to be elucidated. Agonist-dependent trafficking of these receptors appears to be regulated by several pathways both on a short time scale via SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) protein-mediated endocytosis (40Liu Z. Tearle A.W. Nai Q. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and on longer time scales (41Messing A. Brain Res. 1982; 232: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Stollberg J. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1809-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By identifying a homologous receptor in C. elegans, it is anticipated that mutations that disrupt the localization and trafficking of ACR-16 will provide insights into the regulation of vertebrate nicotinic receptors, including the α7-subunit-containing receptors. ACR-16-dependent receptors account for 85% of both the muscle exogenous ACh response and the evoked response elicited by ventral nerve cord stimulation. Surprisingly, acr-16 null mutants show no obvious behavioral phenotype. This is in contrast to mutants of the levamisole-sensitive receptor subunits, unc-29, unc-38, and unc-63, which exhibit defective locomotion and exaggerated body bends. Because the double mutants have a more severe locomotory phenotype than either unc-63 or acr-16 alone, we can conclude that both receptor subtypes contribute to neuromuscular transmission. However, these data establish that the levamisole-sensitive receptors play a greater functional role in locomotion. The predominant role of the levamisole-sensitive receptor in locomotion could reflect the observed differences in desensitization rates of the levamisole-sensitive receptor (slower) compared with the ACR-16-dependent receptor (faster). This difference may enable levamisole-sensitive receptors to be more efficiently coupled to the excitation-contraction machinery downstream of AChR activation. For example, the levamisole-sensitive receptors may be more effective in activating voltage-gated calcium channels or releasing calcium from intracellular stores. Although cholinergic synaptic activity is eliminated at the NMJs of unc-63(x37);acr-16(ok789) double mutants, these worms exhibit residual movement as seen in thrashing assays and locomotion off food. This suggests that some muscle contraction persists in the absence of nicotinic responses. The source of this excitatory input has yet to be identified and could reflect muscarinic, peptidergic, co-transmitter signaling, or myogenic activity. In summary, we have relied upon microarray results derived from body muscle cells to demonstrate that ACR-16 is a subunit of the levamisole-insensitive nicotinic receptor that functions at C. elegans NMJs. We have shown that genetic ablation of this subunit abolishes the non-levamisole cholinergic response in body wall muscles. The identification of this receptor subunit provides new avenues of exploration for the differential trafficking and regulation of two distinctly targeted nicotinic receptors within the same muscle cells in a genetically tractable organism.

https://openalex.org/W2092643288,"Growth factor-induced cell migration underlies various physiological and pathological processes. The mechanisms by which growth factors regulate cell migration are not completely understood. Although intracellular elevation of Ca2+ is known to be critical in cell migration, the source of this Ca2+ elevation and the mechanism by which Ca2+ modulates this process in fibroblast cells are not well defined. Here we show that increase of cellular Ca2+ through Ca2+ influx, rather than Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, is essential for growth factor-induced fibroblast cell migration. Voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels, previously known to exist in excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells, are shown here to be present in fibroblasts as well. Furthermore, these channels are responsible for the Ca2+ influx. L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitors block growth factor-induced Ca2+ influx and fibroblast cell migration. One mechanism by which Ca2+ signals control cell migration is to regulate the contraction of the trailing edge of migrating fibroblasts; this process is controlled by the small GTPase Rho in fast migrating cells such as leukocytes. Downstream of Ca2+, both calmodulin and myosin light chain kinase, but not calcineurin, are involved leading to phosphorylation of the myosin light chain at the trailing end. Thus, trailing edge contraction is critically regulated by Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels in growth factor-induced fibroblast cell migration."

The hdeA gene of E. coli was found to be acid inducible and was revealed by genetic studies to be important for the acid survival of the strain. This study was performed in an attempt to characterize the mechanism of the activity of the HdeA protein. Our data provided in this report strongly suggest that HdeA employs a novel strategy to modulate its chaperone activity: it possesses an ordered conformation that is unable to bind denatured substrate proteins under normal physiological conditions (i.e. at neutral pH) and transforms into a globally disordered conformation that is able to bind substrate proteins under stress conditions (i.e. at a pH below 3). Furthermore, our data indicate that HdeA exposes hydrophobic surfaces that appear to be involved in the binding of denatured substrate proteins at extremely low pH values. In light of our observations, models are proposed to explain the action of HdeA in both a physiological and a molecular context.

In light of our observations, models are proposed to explain the action of HdeA in both a physiological and a molecular context. The extremely acidic environment of the mammalian stomach, with pH values usually between 1 and 3, serves as an important natural barrier to defend against the entrance of microorganisms (1Smith J.L. J. Food Prot. 2003; 66: 1292-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The enteric pathogenic bacteria (e.g. Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli), although normally living in a neutral pH environment, have evolved a mechanism for survival of several hours in such harsh conditions (2Gorden J. Small P.L.C. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 362-367Crossref Google Scholar, 3Small P. Blankenhorn D. Welty D. Zinser E. Slonczewski J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several systems, including the glutamate-dependent and arginine-dependent systems in E. coli, have been identified as contributing to cytoplasmic acid resistance (4Audia J.P. Webb C.C. Foster J.W. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 5Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the acid resistance mechanism for periplasmic space, though having greater survival value, is considerably less understood. The periplasmic space is enveloped by an outer membrane across which molecules smaller than 600 Da are allowed to diffuse freely due to the presence of nonspecific transporters like porins (6Schirmer T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 7Koebnik R. Locher K.P. Van Gelder P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). In view of the porous nature of the outer membrane, proteins present in the periplasm are more vulnerable, thus requiring greater protection than cytoplasmic proteins, when the enteric bacteria are exposed to the harsh environmental conditions encountered in the low pH conditions of the mammalian stomach. Using random mutagenesis caused by transposon insertion, acid-sensitive mutants of S. flexneri (whose wild type is acid-resistant) were isolated (8Waterman S.R. Small P.L.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The hdeA (where hde stands for hns-dependent expression) genetic locus was revealed to be important for the acid resistance phenotype: insertional mutation in the hdeA gene made the organism highly acid sensitive, whereas a reintroduction of the functional hdeA gene restored the acid resistance phenotype (8Waterman S.R. Small P.L.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The hdeA gene in E. coli was found to be acid inducible (9Tucker D.L. Tucker N. Conway T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6551-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and essential for acid resistance (10Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The HdeA protein, localized in the periplasm, was proposed to exhibit chaperone-like activity based on the observation that it prevented the aggregation of rhodanese proteins at low pH during renaturation after being denatured with guanidine hydrochloride (10Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the detailed nature of this activity remains uncertain. Although the crystal structure of the HdeA homodimer was determined, it revealed limited information as to how the protein fulfils its physiological function (10Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Yang F. Gustafson K.R. Boyd M.R. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 763-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones are a large family of proteins that mainly act to prevent aggregation of nonnative proteins under such stressful cellular conditions as non-optimal temperatures, pH, osmotic pressure, or presence of toxic chemicals (12Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 2: 435-449Google Scholar). The most fully investigated types of molecular chaperones include those working under heat shock conditions. By contrast, molecular chaperones acting under acidic conditions represent a type that has rarely been investigated (13Poon S. Rybchyn M.S. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Carver J.A. Pankhurst G.J. Wilson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30532-39540Google Scholar, 14Wang K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2001; 287: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This study was performed in an attempt to characterize such activity in detail, especially the response of this chaperone-like activity to changes in pH values. Data have been provided to demonstrate that HdeA exhibits chaperone-like activity only at a pH below 3 (corresponding to the mammalian stomach pH range) by transforming into a globally disordered conformation. In light of these observations, a working model for HdeA action in physiological contexts is proposed. Materials—Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) 1The abbreviations used are: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. were obtained from Sigma. Hydrochloric acid, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and trichloroacetic acid were of analytical grade. Plasmid Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant HdeA—The DNA fragment containing the hdeA gene, amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of E. coli JM109(DE3), was inserted into the pET21b expression vector after both were digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The ligated plasmids were then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for amplification and screening. The constructed plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing (Bioasia Inc., Shanghai, China). The HdeA protein, overexpressed in pET21b-HdeA-transformed BL21(DE3) cells (present in the periplasmic space), was purified using methods previously described (being the 10-kDa protein in Ref. 15Liu Y. Fu X. Shen J. Zhang H. Hong W. Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 316: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce) and was expressed as the molar concentration of the protomer. Preparation of Periplasmic Protein Extracts and RbsB—Periplasmic extracts of JM109(DE3) and BL21(DE3) cells were obtained by osmotic shock according to methods previously described (15Liu Y. Fu X. Shen J. Zhang H. Hong W. Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 316: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Neu H.C. Heppel L.A. J. Biol.

The procedure for RbsB purification from periplasmic extracts has been described elsewhere (15Liu Y. Fu X. Shen J. Zhang H. Hong W. Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 316: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Preparation of Polyclonal Antiserum against HdeA and Western Blotting Analysis—The polyclonal antiserum against HdeA from rabbit was prepared as described (18Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman D. Smith J.G.J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using the anti-HdeA serum (at 1/1000 dilution) and the goat anti-rabbit anti-IgG (at 1/1000 dilution) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Assay of Chaperone-like Activity—The chaperone-like activity was assayed by either qualitatively following the appearance of substrate proteins in the supernatant instead of in the pellet (Fig. 1, A, C-E) or quantitatively monitoring the decrease of the fluorescence light-scattering intensity of the aggregates (Figs. 1E and 4C). Sulfate, trichloroacetate, or chloride was added as the anion to achieve effective aggregation of the substrate proteins at low pH values (19Goto Y. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 20Goto Y. Takahashi N. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3480-3488Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). For assaying the different substrate proteins (ADH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, RbsB), the pH values were adjusted with different acids (HCl or trichloroacetic acid). The presence of substrate proteins in the supernatants or pellets, after being incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, was examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Each sampling supernatant was neutralized to pH 7 by adding Tris base solution with the corresponding pellet resuspended in water to a volume equal to that of the supernatant.Fig. 4HdeA prevents the acid-induced aggregation of ADH via hydrophobic interactions. A, fluorescence emission spectra of ANS (100 μm, in HCl solution of pH 1.5 with 150 mm NaCl) in the presence of HdeA. Fluorescence spectra for ANS were recorded for the dye alone (curve 1) and in the absence (curve 1) or presence of 15 μm HdeA (curve 2) after excitation at 395 nm. B, titration of HdeA with ANS. HdeA (15 μm) was titrated with an increasing concentration of ANS. The samples were excited at 395 nm with the maximal emission recorded. The fluorescence values were utilized to calculate the molar ratio of ANS to HdeA, which was then plotted against the concentration of ANS. C, the relative chaperone activities of HdeA (15 μm), assayed using ADH (4.3 μm) as the substrate protein and measured at pH 1.5 (as in Fig. 1E), in the presence of different concentrations of ANS. The light-scattering intensity was converted into relative chaperone activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Error bars represent S.E. of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The light-scattering intensity was monitored with a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlling system. The excitation and emission wavelengths were both set at 400 nm (Fig. 1E). The relative chaperone activities (as presented in Fig. 4C) were then calculated as (FADH alone - FADH+HdeA+ANS)/FADH alone (F represents fluorescence intensity at 400 nm). The maximal ADH aggregation in the presence of HdeA (with no ANS added) was defined as 100% relative chaperone activity. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—This was performed using a J-715-150L spectrometer (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The far-UV CD spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 200-250 nm, with the path length of the cuvette being 2 mm. Protein samples (at 20 μm) in 0.1 m Tris were each adjusted to a designated pH value using HCl and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h before the recording (Fig. 3A). NMR Spectrometry—The 15N-labeled HdeA was overexpressed and purified (using methods described above) from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (transformed with the pET21b-HdeA plasmid) grown on a minimal medium containing 1 g/liter 15N ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source. The NMR samples containing 0.5 mm 15N-labeled HdeA were dissolved in buffers of three pH values: 50 mm phosphate, 0.03% (w/v) NaN3 in 90% H2O/10% D2O at pH 5.0 and 50 mm sodium acetate, 0.03% (w/v) NaN3 in 90% H2O/10% D2O at pH 3.5 or pH 2.5. Two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiments were performed at 25 °C using Bruker DMX 500- and 600-MHz NMR spectrometers (Fig. 3, B and C). Detecting the Association and Dissociation between HdeA and the Denatured Substrate Proteins—Soluble complexes resulting from the association between HdeA and denatured substrate protein ADH were isolated by using size-exclusion chromatography and then examined using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Samples (120 μl, 0.15 m NaCl, adjusted to pH 2 with HCl) containing both HdeA and ADH were incubated for 1 h and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min before 100 μl of the supernatant was loaded into a 10 mm × 30 cm Superdex HR-200 size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences). The sample was then eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and collected at 0.5 ml/fraction. Proteins in the fractions collected were separated by SDS-PAGE before being visualized by silver staining. For the dissociation of HdeA-ADH complexes, the sample mixture was neutralized to pH 7 at 25 °C for another hour after being incubated in 0.15 m NaCl at pH 2 for 1 h. The sample was centrifuged (10,000 × g, for 10 min) with the supernatant removed and the pellet resuspended to a volume equal to that of the supernatant before both were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. For the dissociation of the HdeA homodimer, the HdeA proteins (100 μm) were incubated in an HCl solution of pH 2 (with 0.15 m NaCl), an HAc solution of pH 4 (with 0.05 m NaAc and 0.15 m NaCl), or a 50 mm Na3PO4 solution of pH 7 (with 0.15 m NaCl) at 25 °C for 60 min. For the reassociation of the HdeA homodimer, the sample (100 μm HdeA) was neutralized to pH 7 at 25 °C for another hour after being incubated in an HCl solution of pH 2 (with 0.15 m NaCl) for 1 h. The samples were then analyzed by size-exclusion assay as described above. ANS Binding Assay to HdeA—The binding of ANS to HdeA was monitored by measuring the increase of fluorescence intensity for ANS upon its binding to proteins, using a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature control system. To obtain the fluorescence spectra, HdeA samples (at 15 μm) were excited at 395 nm, with emission being recorded between 400 and 600 nm (Fig. 4A). To estimate the number of ANS molecules that were bound to HdeA, the protein (15 μm) was titrated to saturation with increasing dye amounts (0-100 μm). The samples were excited at 395 nm, and maximal emission from ANS was measured. The molar ratios of the bound ANS to HdeA were calculated from fluorescence intensity values as (FHdeA+ANS/F10 μm ANS at saturation) × (10 μm/[HdeA]) (in which FHdeA+ANS, F10 μm ANS at saturation and [HdeA], respectively, represent maximal fluorescence intensity at indicated ANS concentrations, maximal fluorescence intensity for 10 μm ANS that was fully saturated by excessive amounts of HdeA, and the molar concentration of HdeA protein). All the data points were fitted to sigmoidal plot. To explore the effect of ANS binding on chaperone-like activity of HdeA, preincubation of HdeA with ANS was carried out for 3 min before being assayed for the relative chaperone activity as described above. Primary Structure Analysis—The theoretical charge titration curve for HdeA was generated using the program provided at www.iut-arles.up.univ-mrs.fr/w3bb/d_abim/compo-p.html. The hydropathy index for HdeA was calculated using the program provided at cn.expasy.org/tools/protscale.html, which uses the method of Kyte and Doolittle (21Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). The window size of the index was set to all 89 residues of HdeA. HdeA Exhibits Chaperone-like Activity Exclusively at pH Lower than 3—We have been focusing on understanding certain features of periplasmic proteins of E. coli, including their stability under various conditions (15Liu Y. Fu X. Shen J. Zhang H. Hong W. Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 316: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In an attempt to investigate whether such proteins are resistant to aggregation caused by acid treatment, the proteins in the whole periplasmic extracts from two different E. coli strains, JM109(DE3) and BL21(DE3), were seen to behave very differently under extremely low pH conditions. Although many proteins in the periplasmic extract of BL21 formed aggregates and thus appeared in the precipitate (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6), almost none of JM109 formed such aggregates and thus remained in the supernatant (lanes 3 and 4) under treatment of 1 m HCl. This difference is apparently attributed to the existence of HdeA in the JM109 extract and the absence of it in the BL21 extract, as revealed by the Western blotting analysis (lanes 1 and 2). Supporting this claim is the effective prevention of the acid-induced aggregation of BL21 periplasmic extract when exogenous HdeA was added (lanes 7 and 8). To further elucidate the nature of HdeA action, the aggregation-suppressing process was systematically examined using two typical substrates of chaperone-like activity assays (ADH and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and one protein of the periplasmic space (RbsB) at various pH values (adjusted with two acids, hydrochloric acid and trichloroacetic acid). The data clearly demonstrate that the aggregation of all three proteins at pH values below 2.5 was effectively suppressed by the addition of an excessive amount of HdeA (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-4; Fig. 1C, lanes 1-6; Fig. 1D, lanes 1-4). Nevertheless, the aggregation of these substrate proteins induced at pH higher than 3 was not suppressed by addition of HdeA (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6; Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8; Fig. 1D, lanes 5-8). The degree of prevention of protein aggregation for ADH in acid (pH 1.6) was found to highly correspond to the increasing molar ratio of HdeA to ADH (Fig. 1E). A small amount of HdeA was found in the precipitate together with ADH, most likely in the form of insoluble HdeA-ADH complexes, when ADH was present in an excessive amount (data not shown). These results strongly indicate that HdeA is able to effectively and nonspecifically suppress the aggregation of periplasmic proteins occurring at extremely low pH values. We have also observed that HdeA appears to be completely incapable of suppressing the thermal aggregation of ADH and the aggregation of insulin induced by dithiothreitol (data not shown), both of which are typically effectively suppressed by other molecular chaperones (22Fu X. Zhang H. Zhang X. Cao Y. Jiao W. Liu C. Song Y. Abulimiti A. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6337-6348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Jiao W. Qian M. Li P.

HdeA Binds to the Denatured Substrate Proteins at pH Lower than 3 but Releases Them at Neutral pH—Given that HdeA is able to effectively suppress protein aggregation at extremely low pH values (Fig. 1), it must then be determined whether HdeA forms soluble complexes with the denatured substrate proteins, as molecular chaperones usually do. The formation of such soluble complexes at pH 2 is clearly demonstrated by the appearance of an absorption peak on the elution curve of the size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A) and the coexistence of HdeA and ADH in the fractions at the peak (fractions from 11 to 15 ml) as detected by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A, inset). The broad feature of the peak indicates a certain extent of heterogeneity for the HdeA-ADH complexes. The reason that the integrated absorbance values of curve 2 (ADH) and curve 3 (HdeA) do no add up to curve 1 (ADH+HdeA) is that curve 2 (for free ADH) was performed after the aggregated ADH was partially removed from the sample by centrifugation. Similar soluble complexes between HdeA and the periplasmic proteins RbsB or DegP were also detected at pH 2 but were almost completely undetectable when the assay was performed at pH values higher than 3 (data not shown). The fate of such soluble HdeA-ADH complexes (formed at pH 2) when returned to neutral pH was then examined. Their dissociation at pH 7 was indicated by the disappearance of ADH from the supernatant and its appearance in the precipitate (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2), most likely because of the release and subsequent aggregation of ADH from the soluble HdeA-ADH complexes. HdeA Is Transformed into a Globally Disordered Conformation upon a Decrease of pH to Lower than 3—The nature of HdeA conformation, which allows it to exhibit chaperone-like activity at pH values lower than 3 but not at pH higher than 3, was then examined using CD spectrometry. The far-UV CD spectra recorded at various pH values, shown in Fig. 3A, revealed a sharp change in its secondary structure at a pH around 3, from a highly ordered form at pH above 3.1 (as indicated by a high content of α-helices, revealed by the appearance of the maximum ellipticity values at 208 and 222 nm; also see Ref. 10Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) to a highly disordered form at pH below 2.5 (as indicated by the appearance of the maximum ellipticity values at 203 nm and the simultaneous disappearance of those at 208 and 222 nm). Similar changes in tertiary structure were also detected using both near-UV CD spectrometry and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy (data not shown). To add further support for the occurrence of such conformational changes for HdeA accompanying the pH changes, two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments were performed. The 1-15N HSQC spectra of HdeA recorded at pH 5.0 and 3.5 showed well dispersed signals, indicating the presence of well folded structures (Fig. 3B). The chemical shifts of the NH cross peaks of HdeA at pH 7.0 (not shown) was almost completely identical to that at pH 5.0. However, the NH signals of HdeA significantly changed when the pH was lowered from 5.0 (Fig. 3B, blue spots) to 3.5 (red spots), indicating a conformational change that was marginally detected by far-UV CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3A). The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of HdeA recorded at pH 2.5 markedly differs from those recorded at pH 5.0 or 3.5. These chemical shift dispersions clearly suggest that HdeA adopts a fully unfolded structure at pH 2.5 (Fig. 3C), being highly consistent with the far-UV CD spectroscopy observations (Fig. 3A). In addition, the large cross peak at chemical shifts of ∼7.5 ppm for 1H and ∼123 ppm for 15N is a peak aliased four times in the 15N dimension. Its actual 15N chemical shift is about 33 ppm. This peak should be the overlap of all 12 lysine side chain NH3 signals. Normally, at neutral pH, lysine side chain NH3 has fast exchanges with the solvent and is invisible for NMR. Apparently, it shows up at pH 2.5, probably because of a change in the exchange rate. The fact that HdeA exhibits chaperone-like activity only at pH values lower than 3, where the protein possess a globally disordered conformation, strongly suggests that a structural transformation from ordered to disordered at ∼pH 3 is needed for HdeA to gain the capacity to bind the denatured substrate proteins. Because previous studies have demonstrated that HdeA exists as homodimers at neutral pH and starts to dissociate significantly into monomers at ∼pH 4, it was proposed that the dissociation of the dimeric form of HdeA allows it to bind denatured substrate proteins at pH 2 (10Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In view of the observations reported here, one issue requiring clarification is the importance of dimeric dissociation and conformation disordering for HdeA to work. Results from both chemical cross-linking studies (data not shown) and size-exclusion chromatography analysis performed at pH 7 demonstrated that HdeA exists as a homodimer. Although our size-exclusion chromatography analysis also revealed a similar decrease of the apparent size of the HdeA protein at pH 4 (Fig. 3D), the data reported here demonstrate the unambiguous inability of HdeA to prevent the aggregation of substrate proteins at pH values higher than 3 (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6; Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8; and Fig. 1D, lanes 5-8). These data all together suggest that it is the disordered conformation, instead of dissociation per se, that is essential for HdeA to work. Data presented in Fig. 3D also demonstrate that HdeA monomers are able to reassociate to form dimers when the pH value is raised from pH 2 to 7, suggesting a reversible nature for the dissociation process. The ordered conformation of HdeA is apparently also resumed upon such a switch of pH from 2 to 7, as shown by CD spectroscopy and NMR spectrometry studies (not shown). HdeA Exposes Hydrophobic Surfaces That Appear to Be Involved in Binding Denatured Substrate Proteins at pH Lower than 3—It is generally believed that molecular chaperones interact with their denatured substrate proteins via hydrophobic interactions (12Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 2: 435-449Google Scholar). To explore whether HdeA employs a similar strategy in preventing the aggregation of substrate proteins at extremely low pH values, the extent of hydrophobic surfaces exposed at neutral and extremely low pH values was examined. Data shown in Fig. 4A demonstrate the hydrophobic exposure at pH 1.5 (compare curves 1 and 2) and its absence at pH 7.0 (data not shown), as reflected by the increase of the intensity of fluorescence emission of a commonly used hydrophobic probe, ANS (19Goto Y. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 24Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, titration of HdeA with ANS indicates a binding curve apparently with a sigmoidal feature (Fig. 4B). The number of ANS molecules that bind to HdeA was estimated to be 3.2. A decrease of the relative chaperone-like activity of HdeA was observed when it was preincubated with excessive ANS (Fig. 4C), whereas the same amounts of ANS exhibited little influence on the aggregation of ADH alone (data not shown). This decrease is likely a result of the binding of ANS to the hydrophobic surfaces of HdeA, which would block the access of the substrate proteins, also suggesting the involvement of exposed hydrophobic surfaces in binding denatured substrate proteins. This study represents a major effort to understand how HdeA, a periplasmic protein found to be required for E. coli cells to survive in acidic environments, works to prevent the aggregation of proteins at extremely low pH values. Experimental observations include the following: (a) HdeA exhibits chaperone-like activity, i.e. being able to bind to the denatured substrate proteins, exclusively at extremely low pH values and releases them at neutral pH; (b) HdeA possesses a globally disordered conformation at extremely low pH values but an ordered conformation at neutral pH; and (c) HdeA exposes hydrophobic surfaces that appear to be involved in binding denatured substrate proteins at extremely low pH values. What is most noteworthy is the parallel appearance of a globally disordered conformation and the chaperone-like activity, both exclusively below pH 3, that coincides closely to the pH range found in the mammalian stomach. In light of the properties of HdeA presented here, together with the previous observation that HdeA is necessary for enterobacteria to survive at extremely low pH values (10Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), it is proposed that HdeA might have evolved to protect E. coli cells for survival in the extremely low pH environment that bacteria typically encounter in mammalian stomachs. In particular, HdeA appears to be able to act as an acid-responsive molecular chaperone that prevents protein aggregation in the periplasmic space (that is exposed to the outside environment because of the porous nature of the outer membrane) at such extremely low pH values. The physiological role of HdeA during the passage of the enterobacteria through the stomach may be visualized as follows (as illustrated in Fig. 5). Upon the entrance of the enterobacteria from a neutral environment into an acidic stomach, whose pH is typically maintained in the range of 1-3 by the secreted HCl, the structure of the HdeA protein is immediately transformed from an ordered conformation into a disordered one, which allows it to effectively bind to the denatured periplasmic proteins and thereby prevent their aggregation. When the enterobacteria reach the small intestine, where the pH is typically around 7, the proteins bound to HdeA are released and may eventually refold into their native conformation with or without aid (15Liu Y. Fu X. Shen J. Zhang H. Hong W. Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 316: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 591-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) or they may be degraded (25Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 591-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). An analysis of the primary structure of HdeA suggests a possible explanation for such acid-induced conformational disordering as well as the structural basis for chaperone-like activity in a disordered conformation. Two significant features are apparent. First, as shown in Fig. 6A, the positively charged residues, all being Lys, are concentrated at the N- (residues 1Smith J.L. J.

Science. 1967; 156: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and C-terminal (residues 67-89) regions of the protein chain, whereas the negatively charged residues (Asp and Glu) are dispersed throughout the entire sequence. These two Lys-rich terminals may be brought close to each other in space by a disulfide bond between Cys-18 and Cys-66, the existence of which was revealed before by structural determination (10Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Yang F. Gustafson K.R. Boyd M.R. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 763-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Upon a decrease of pH, protonation allows the Lys residues of HdeA to remain positively charged but results in the neutralization of the negatively charged Asp and Glu residues (as shown in Fig. 6B). Such pH-dependent charge alterations might play a role in the conformational transformations from the ordered to the disordered. This feature of charge distribution for HdeA was also noticed previously (26Papoian G.A. Ulander J. Eastwood M.P. Luthey-Schulten Z. Wolynes P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3352-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition, the sole usage of Lys residues as positively charged residues might allow the protonation process to be synchronized, leading to an effective, marked change in the conformation from ordered to disordered. Secondly, hydropathy plotting (Fig. 6C) reveals the existence of two relatively hydrophobic fragments (residues 19-41 and 45-65). Such fragments most likely correspond to the exposed hydrophobic surfaces as detected by ANS binding assays (Fig. 4, A and B) and are thus involved in binding substrate proteins (Fig. 4C). The exposure of these fragments in HdeA might be a result of the combined effects of the protonation, the dimer dissociation, and the conformation disordering. All of these experimental observations and primary structure analyses appear to support the following. Upon the decrease of pH to values lower than 3, conformational disordering somehow transforms HdeA into an “amphipathic molecule” having a hydrophobic tail (consisting of the two hydrophobic fragments) that is involved in substrate binding and a positively charged hydrophilic head (consisting of the two Lys-rich terminals) that enhances the solubility of HdeA-substrate complexes via the hydration of the charges (as schematically shown in Fig. 6D). Such a postulated “amphipathic molecule” would act as an effective molecular chaperone in preventing the aggregation of substrate proteins. A certain degree of structural disordering has been increasingly recognized as an important feature for molecular chaperones to bind their denatured substrate proteins (27Tompa P. Csermely P. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 28Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3061) Google Scholar, 29Dunker A.K. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Williams R.M. Romero P. Oh J.S. Oldfield C.J. Campen A.M. Ratliff C.M. Hipps K.W. Ausio J.

HdeA apparently represents an extreme case of this in that it binds the denatured substrate proteins only in its globally disordered conformation. It is conceivable that the conformational disordering might allow the optimal exposure of the hydrophobic fragments, which would play a similar role to the hydrophobic surfaces present in a relatively ordered conformation of other molecular chaperones. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that the chaperone-like activity of HdeA changed little when the disulfide bond was reduced by dithiothreitol (data not shown), indicating that the breakage of the disulfide bond does not interfere with the hydration of the charged residues. The detail role of the disulfide bond is being investigated. We have provided evidence in a series of studies that molecular chaperones, at least of the small heat shock family, are able to modulate their chaperone activity via oligomeric dissociation (22Fu X. Zhang H. Zhang X. Cao Y. Jiao W. Liu C. Song Y. Abulimiti A. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6337-6348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Jiao W. Qian M. Li P. Zhao L. Chang Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HdeA appears to employ a markedly different strategy for modulating its chaperone activity: it possesses an ordered conformation that is unable to bind denatured substrate proteins under normal physiological conditions (i.e. at neutral pH) and transforms into a globally disordered structure that is able to bind the substrate proteins under stress conditions (i.e. at extremely low pH).

In this study the first biochemical and kinetic properties of full-length NS3 (NS3FL)-associated NTPase, RTPase, and RNA helicase are presented.

The results show that NS5 stimulated the NS3 NTPase and RTPase activities. The NS5 stimulation of NS3 NTPase was dose-dependent until an equimolar ratio was reached.

Hatsu M. Takamizawa K. Miyamura T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were expressed in E. coli and purified to demonstrate the RNA helicase activity. The RNA helicase activity of the full-length NS3, its RNA binding properties, the kinetic parameters or the influence of the protease cofactor, NS2BH domain, on the RNA helicase activity has not been previously studied to date. In this study we report that the full-length NS3 with or without NS2B cofactor domain, expressed in E. coli and purified, exhibits a catalytically more efficient RNA helicase activity than the N-terminal-truncated NS3 helicase domain, suggesting that the protease domain enhances RNA helicase activity. A functionally active serine catalytic triad is not required for this enhancement of RNA helicase activity as shown by mutagenesis of the protease catalytic triad residue, H51A.The multifunctional NS3 protein exists in a complex with NS5, which itself has two enzyme activities, the 5′-RNA O- methyl transferase involved in 5′-capping and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase required for viral RNA replication in DEN2-infected cells (39Kapoor M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19100-19106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 40Westaway E.G. Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Adv. Virus Res. 2003; 59: 99-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of NS5 interaction on the NTPase/RNA helicase and the RTPase activity of NS3. Our results show that the NS5 stimulates the NTPase activity of NS3 in a dose-dependent manner until an equimolar stoichiometry is attained, which supports the notion that the heterodimeric NS3·NS5 complex is the functional unit involved in unwinding double-stranded RNA during replication. Furthermore, RNA binding analyses by gel shift assays show that NS3 binds to RNA, and a positively charged motif, RKRK, which is conserved in Flavivirus NS3, is required for this RNA binding activity. Mutation of this motif significantly reduced the NTPase/RNA helicase activity of NS3, suggesting that this motif is an important determinant in NTPase/RNA helicase function of NS3.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructs—The construction of the NS3FL expression plasmid with a His6 tag at the N terminus is described previously (22Bartelma G. Padmanabhan R. Virology. 2002; 299: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NS2BH(QR)-NS3FL expression plasmid, which contains the hydrophilic domain of NS2B shown to be sufficient for activation of the NS3 protease domain (13Falgout B. Miller R.H. Lai C.-J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2034-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), was constructed as follows. The PCR primers used were 5′-CGCGGATCCGCCGATTTGGAACTGGAGAGAGCCGCC-3′ (the BamHI site is underlined; from the 5′-TCC (Ser) codon to GCC (Ala) codon represents amino acid positions 48-57 of NS2B as described previously (14Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)) and 5′-TTGGCGCGCTGTTCTTCCTCTTCGTTTTTTATCGAC-3′ (the BssHII site is underlined; the primer represents amino acid positions 93-85 of NS2B); the former codes for RGSADLELERAA57, and the latter codes for 85SIKNEEEEQ93. The primers used for NS3-pro were 5′-TTGGCGCGCTGGAGTATTGTGGGATGTCCCTTCACC-3′ (representing the sequence coding from the CGC and GCT, Arg and Ala codons, respectively (130R↓AGV, the arrow denotes a protease-sensitive site at the N terminus of NS3 with the underlined BssHII site) and the reverse primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTACTTTCGAAAAATGTCATCTTCGATCTnt5049-3′ (the HindIII site is underlined). The products of these two PCR reactions were cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen). The positive clones were identified, and the plasmid DNAs were digested with either BamHI + BssHII or BssHII + HindIII. Both fragments were cloned into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) at BamHI and HindIII sites, giving rise to pQE30-NS2BH(QR)-NS3pro. To generate the NS2BH(QR)-NS3FL, the NS3-pro region in the pQE30-NS2BH(QR)-NS3pro was replaced by NS3FL as follows. pQE30-NS3FL (22Bartelma G. Padmanabhan R. Virology. 2002; 299: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and pQE30-NS2BH(QR)-NS3pro were both digested with NdeI. After removing the NS3pro fragment, the corresponding fragment of NS3FL was inserted into the digested pQE30-NS2BH, generating pQE30-NS2BH(QR)-NS3FL. To generate the pQE30-NS2BHQR-NS3FL(H51A) plasmid, the His51 → Ala mutation of the serine protease catalytic triad was inserted by replacing the wild type BamHI-BssHII fragment with the corresponding fragment from the mutant NS2BH(QR)-NS3-pro plasmid described previously (14Clum S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30715-30723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The mutant pQE30-NS3FL (184RKRK → QNGN; hereafter referred as 4M) plasmid was constructed by overlap PCR (41Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar, 42Zhao L.J. Zhang Q.X. Padmanabhan R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as follows. Four primers were synthesized: Primer 1, 5′-CTAATGCATAAAGGAAAGAGGATT-3′ (nt 4693-4716); Primer 2, 5′-CAAAACGGAAATTTGACCATCATGGACCTCCAC-3′ (the 4-amino acid region mutated spans 5071-5082, and the primer spans up to position 5103); Primer 3, ATTTCCGTTTTGAAAAATGTCATCTTCGATCTC-3′ (reverse primer, nt positions 5050-5082; underlined in 2 and 3 is the 4M mutant region); Primer 4, 5′-CAGGATTAATGTCCTCAGGCCCCG-3′ (nt 5161-5184). Individual PCR reactions were carried out using primers 1 + 3 and 2 + 4, PCR products were mixed, and a third PCR was done using primers 1 and 4 as described (42Zhao L.J. Zhang Q.X. Padmanabhan R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T-Easy Cloning vector (Promega, Madison WI). All constructs were verified by sequencing. The PCR product (491 bp) containing the 4M mutation was cloned into pQE30 vector (Qiagen) containing the wild type NS3FL cDNA (22Bartelma G. Padmanabhan R. Virology. 2002; 299: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) between the NsiI (nt 4696) and Bsu36I (nt5166) sites within the NS3 coding sequence (see Fig. 1).Purification of Recombinant Proteins—E. coli strain, Top 10F′ (Invitrogen), or BL21 was transformed with appropriate expression plasmid, and the cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and 0.5% w/v glucose to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. Cells were centrifuged at 6000 × g and resuspended in glucose-free LB+ ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were grown for 5 h at 30 °C, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at -80 °C until use. For purification recombinant proteins, the bacterial pellets were resuspended in native lysis buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 40% glycerol. Cell lysates were loaded onto a cobalt-based immobilized metal affinity column (Talon™, Clontech). After incubation and then washing, the recombinant proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The fractions containing the highest protein concentration were pooled, dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 40% glycerol. In some cases the recombinant proteins were purified by using the fast protein liquid chromatography HiTrap Chelating HP 1-ml column) (AKTAprime system from Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were pooled and loaded again to the HiTrap SP FF (1 ml) column. The fractions with the highest protein concentrations were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, and 40% glycerol.RNA Substrates—For the electrophoretic mobility shift assays and the 5′-RTPase assays, RNA of 100 nucleotides in length containing sequences from the 5′-end of DEN2 RNA (which includes the 5′-untranslated region of 96 nucleotides) was obtained by in vitro transcription of the PCR product. The template for PCR was the pSY2 plasmid (encoding the subgenomic RNA (43You S. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33714-33722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)). The concentration of the RNA was measured by using a spectrophotometer, and the integrity of RNA was verified by partially denaturing PAGE (3.5% containing 7 m urea) followed by ethidium bromide staining. For RNA helicase assays two oligomer RNAs, a 30- and 15-mer (44Tackett A.J. Wei L. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), were synthesized (Dharmacon). The sequences of the oligomers are 5′-CAUCAUGCAGGACAGUCGGAUCGCAGUCAG-3′ and 5′-GUAGUACGUCCUGUC-3. The 30-mer was labeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 2 h. Then the labeled oligomer was extracted by phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was further removed by passing through two Sephadex G-25 spin columns (Bio-Rad). The purified radiolabeled oligomer was mixed with the complementary strand, heated to 95 °C for 10 min, and cooled slowly to room temperature (>3 h).NTPase and RTPase Assays—The NTPase and RTPase assays were based on the original colorimetric method described several decades ago to quantify the inorganic phosphate present in serum (45Lawrence R. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1974; 11: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 46Bartels P.C. Roijers A.F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1975; 61: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and more recently in a study of HCV NS3-associated NTPase (47Lam A.M. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The method used in our study has slight modifications. Briefly, the reaction mixture (50 μl) consisted of 25 mm HEPES-K+, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NTP (unless the NTP concentration was varied), and 140 nm purified NS3 protein. For RTPase assays, the NTP was substituted with triphosphorylated RNA (100 nucleotides in length). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30-60 min (unless otherwise indicated) at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding 10 μl of trichloroacetic acid. A freshly prepared solution of 140 μl containing a 6:1 ratio of 0.42% ammonium molybdate in 1 n H2SO4 and 10% ascorbic acid was added and incubated for 20-40 min at 42 °C. The “molybdenum blue” formed was measured at A780 nm using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax, Molecular Devices).RNA Helicase Assay—The reaction mixture (20 μl) for RNA helicase consisted of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 500 nm purified protein (unless the protein amounts were varied), and 5 nm substrate. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for various times and then terminated by adding 5 μl of 5× RNA loading dye (100 mm EDTA and 0.7% SDS). Samples were loaded onto a 12% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was electrophoresed at 100 V for 1.5 h, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The ratio of released single strands versus the total of single and double strands was quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Ficoll 400, 20-150 nm 32P-labeled DEN2 RNA, 0.5-1 μg of NS3FL or NS3FL(4M). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min on ice, and 3 μl of loading buffer (40% sucrose) was added. The reaction mixtures were developed using 1.5% acrylamide, 1% agarose composite gel. The bands were identified by autoradiography after drying the gel.RESULTSExpression and purification of DEN2 NS3FL proteins. A previous study from our laboratory indicated that the N-terminal-truncated DEN2 NS3 (NS3del.2, referred to as NS3Δ160) protein had basal NTPase that was stimulated by the addition of poly(A). NS3Δ160 had the deletion of the serine protease domain but contained all the conserved domains attributed to NTPase/RNA helicases of DEXH family members. The kinetic constants of the NTPase activity of NS3Δ160 were close to those of other flaviviral NTPases. However, the RNA helicase activity of NS3del.2 required 2.7 μm concentrations of purified NS3del.2 protein to unwind less than 5% of a 29-bp RNA duplex. On the other hand, the hepatitis C virus NS3 and the bovine diarrhea virus p80 RNA helicases required 0.1-1 pmol (∼10-100 nm) of enzyme for unwinding similar substrates (27Kim D.W. Gwack Y. Han J.H. Choe J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 36Warrener P. Collett M.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1720-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also reported that the RNA-stimulated NTPase activity of NS3del.2 was abolished by mutation of the positively charged motif, 184RKRK → 184QNGN, of NS3 or by deletion of an additional 20-amino acid residues from NS3Δ160 (NS3Δ180) even though the latter mutant still contained the 184RKRK motif very close to the N terminus. In either of these two mutants the basal NTPase activity was still retained (16Li H. Clum S. You S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3108-3116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From these results we concluded that the 184RKRK motif, although not required for basal NTPase activity, played an important role in the RNA-mediated stimulation of NTPase. The mechanism for requirement of the positively charged motif in RNA-stimulated NTPase was unknown. In this study we hypothesized that the weak RNA helicase activity associated with the NS3Δ160 protein might be because of suboptimal folding of the NS3Δ160 protein and/or binding to double-stranded RNA substrate in contrast to the RNA helicases associated with the full-length NS3 of hepatitis C virus or the p80 of bovine viral diarrhea virus. We also considered the alternate possibility that the DEN2 RNA helicase may be stimulated by interaction with other viral components such as NS5, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, with which NS3 forms a stable complex in Flavivirus-infected cells (39Kapoor M. Zhang L. Ramachandra M. Kusukawa J. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19100-19106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 48Cui T. Sugrue R.J. Xu Q. Lee A.K. Chan Y.C. Fu J. Virology. 1998; 246: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, none of the mosquito-borne flaviviral NS3 RNA helicases have been studied in detail to date.In this study we launched detailed biochemical and kinetic analyses of NTPase/RNA helicase activities of full-length NS3 (NS3FL) containing both the serine protease domain at the N terminus and the conserved NTPase/RNA helicase domains at the C terminus. Because the protease domain of NS3 interacts with the hydrophilic domain of NS2B (NS2BH), we sought to examine the effect of this interaction on NTPase and RNA helicase activities. To this end we also constructed the expression plasmid, NS2BH(QR)-NS3FL, encoding the precursor protein in which the NS2BH is linked to the protease domain of NS3 flanking the two amino acid residues, QR, occupying the P2 and P1 positions of the protease cleavage site. The recombinant protein expressed from this plasmid underwent cis cleavage at the protease-sensitive site QR↓ due to interaction of NS2BH with the NS3 protease domain to produce the non-covalent binary complex, NS2BH/NS3FL. We also constructed the NS2BH(QR)-NS3FL(H51A) expression plasmid containing the mutant catalytic triad residue (H51A). The protein expressed from this plasmid did not undergo cis cleavage and was in the precursor form (see Fig. 2A) as expected. To analyze the role of 184RKRK motif in NTPase and RNA helicase activities of NS3FL, the NS3FL containing the mutant motif 184QNGN was constructed (Fig. 1). The transformed E. coli TOP10F′ cells were grown, and the proteins were expressed and purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 2 shows the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE of the purified proteins. To study the effect of NS5 on the NTPase and RNA helicase activities of NS3, NS5 protein was expressed from the pMHA77-3 plasmid as described previously (49Ackermann M. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39926-39937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). The NS2BH(QR)-NS3FL precursor underwent partial cleavage at the QR↓ site during purification from the Talon™ column as shown in Fig. 2D (lane 2). We observed that if the pH of the buffer used for dialysis of the protein was at 9.0, the cis cleavage of the QR↓ site was enhanced and was essentially complete (Fig. 2D, lane 1). The identities of the purified proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting using either anti-NS2B (Fig. 2E) or anti-NS3 antibodies (Fig. 2F; data not shown). The NS3FL and NS3FL(4M) proteins were expressed and purified as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 2B; data not shown).Fig. 2Purification of NS3 proteins. The purification of NS3 proteins with an N-terminal His tag was as described previously for NS3FL (22Bartelma G. Padmanabhan R.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, poses a major threat to human health. Over the last decade, the number of registered cases has been progressively increasing, resulting presently in approximately 2 million deaths per year (statistics available on the World Wide Web at www.who.int). The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis raises serious concerns about future capabilities to control this pathogen. Chemotherapy is further complicated by the ability of M. tuberculosis to persist in the lungs of infected individuals for decades by switching to a dormant or latent phase (1Bloom B.R. McKinney J.D. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 872-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which also induces tolerance to current antibiotics (2Wayne L.G. Sramek H.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 807-811Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 3Wallis R.S. Patil S. Cheon S.H. Edmonds K. Phillips M. Perkins M.D. Joloba M. Namale A. Johnson J.L. Teixeira L. Dietze R.

Estimates by the WHO suggest that about one-third of the world's population is infected with persistent mycobacteria. Reactivation of these dormant bacteria can occur either spontaneously or as the consequence of an immunocompromised state (e.g. HIV infection/therapy), resulting in active tuberculosis. It is thus clear that a successful long term strategy against M. tuberculosis requires antibiotics targeting the bacteria also in the persistent state. Latency is associated with nonreplicating or very slow growth of M. tuberculosis, and several experimental in vitro models for the dormant phase of the bacilli have been developed (4Wayne L.G.

Comparison of gene expression profiles and proteome analyses of active versus nonreplicating bacteria have identified a number of genes that are up-regulated in the dormant phase. Genes involved in oxidative stress, anaerobic respiration, and the metabolism of sulfur have consistently been identified as up-regulated in response to limited access to oxygen and nutrient starvation (8Hu Y.

Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3821-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One of the genes active in the dormant phase of M. tuberculosis is nirA (Rv2391) (9Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Voskuil M.I. Liu Y. Mangan J.A. Monahan I.M. Dolganov G. Efron B. Butcher P.D. Nathan C. Schoolnik G.K. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 10Hampshire T. Soneij S.

Himar1 transposon mutagenesis has further shown that nirA is an essential gene (12Sasetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence, derived from the nirA gene, shows homology to a family of ferredoxin-dependent sulfite/nitrite reductases. These enzymes are found in archaea, bacteria, fungi, and plants (for a review, see Refs. 13Crane B.R. Getzoff E.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and 14Nakayama M. Akashi T. Hase T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The sulfite reductases catalyze the reduction of sulfite to sulfide, one step in the biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids and cofactors. Nitrite reductases participate in the assimilation of nitrogen via nitrate in plants and can also act in anaerobic energy metabolism. This class of sulfite/nitrite reductases generally accepts both nitrite and sulfite as substrate, but the particular metabolic function is reflected in pronounced differences in the kinetic parameters. These enzymes contain a unique combination of cofactors, a [Fe4-S4] iron-sulfur cluster and a siroheme (15Krueger R.J. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2892-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). NirA also shows weak amino acid sequence similarity to bacterial NADPH-dependent [Fe4-S4]- and siroheme-containing sulfite reductases (e.g. 23% sequence identity to CysI from Escherichia coli). Unlike the monomeric ferredoxin-dependent enzymes, the NADPH-dependent sulfite reductases are oligomeric complexes consisting of four or eight subunits of the hemoprotein component (CysI) and eight flavoprotein subunits that deliver electrons derived from NADPH to the redox centers of the hemoprotein subunit (16Siegel L.M. Davis P.S. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1572-1586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zeghouf M. Fontecave M. Coves J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37651-37656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the ferredoxin-dependent enzymes, the electron donor binds transiently and delivers electrons to the [Fe4-S4] cluster, one at a time (18Knaff D.B. Hirasawa M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 93-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The electrons are then transferred to the siroheme, which coordinates the substrate. The only available structural information for this enzyme family is the crystal structure of a truncated form of the hemoprotein subunit of NADPH-dependent sulfite reductase from E. coli, CysI, where 73 amino acids at the N terminus had been proteolytically removed before crystallization (19Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1995; 270: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12120-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). No three-dimensional structure for a representative of the ferredoxin-dependent sulfite/nitrite reductases is yet available. Here, we show that the nirA gene from M. tuberculosis encodes [Fe4-S4] and siroheme-dependent sulfite reductase. The crystal structure of the mycobacterial enzyme, a potential target for novel drugs against human persistent tuberculosis infection, revealed an unexpected covalent bond between the side chains of Tyr69 and Cys161 in the immediate vicinity of the siroheme cofactor and the substrate binding site. The functional implications of this tyrosyl-cysteine residue in the active site of NirA have been probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Gene Cloning and Expression Screening—The gene coding for the predicted NirA protein (Rv2391) 1There is an annotation ambiguity regarding the exact definition of the open reading frame coding for NirA (Rv2391) in the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The Swiss-Prot data base entry P71753 assigns the first methionine of the sequence MSAKENPQMTTARPAKARNEG as the N terminus, whereas in the GenBank™ entry AAK46756, the second methionine is defined as start of the NirA protein. The latter appears more likely, since it results in a better Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and therefore a construct starting with the second methionine was chosen for further work. was amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA by PCR using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) with the appropriate upstream primer GATCCATGGCCACTGCACGTCCCGCCAAG and the downstream primer GATAAGCTTATCGCAGGTCGTCCTCCTCG. The PCR fragments containing upstream NcoI and downstream HindIII sites were cloned into the pMOSBlue vector (Amersham Biosciences), and the nucleotide sequence of the PCR product was verified by DNA sequencing. Extensive expression screening using a series of expression vectors and several E. coli strains at different temperatures, however, only resulted in insoluble protein. Availability of the siroheme cofactor might be limiting for proper folding, and co-expression of cysG, coding for an uroporphyrinogen III C-methyl-transferase active in the biosynthesis of siroheme, has been shown to support the production of soluble siroheme-containing proteins (21Wu J.Y. Siegel L.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Curdt I. Singh B.B. Jakoby M. Hachtel W. Böhme H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cysG gene was therefore amplified from Salmonella typhimurium genomic DNA and cloned into the expression vector utilizing the PBAD promoter pACYC origin of replication and compatible with all of our nirA expression constructs. Co-expression of cysG resulted in partially soluble product (up to ∼20% of the total amount of NirA produced) using modified pET28a-NirA plasmids containing either a His6 tag (MDVSHHHHHHG) or an IgG-binding ZZ tag (23Nilsson B. Moks T. Jansson B. Abrahamsen L. Elmblad A. Holmgren E. Henrichson C. Jones T.A. Uhlen M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) inserted into the NcoI site. Protein Production and Purification—The pET28a expression system was chosen to produce the recombinant His6-NirA enzyme with E. coli BL21(DE3) as expression host. Typically, cells were grown in 2 liters of LB medium at 21 °C and induced in midlog phase by adding 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 0.01% arabinose and increasing the concentration of FeSO4 to 1 mm. After 24 h, E. coli cells were harvested, resuspended, and disrupted in a buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazol) by lysozyme (0.08 mg/ml) treatment and sonication. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The lysates were added to an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity matrix (Qiagen), and the bound proteins were eluted by an imidazol step-gradient. After desalting on a NAP10 column (Amersham Biosciences), the His6-NirA protein was purified to homogeneity by ion exchange chromatography using a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and NaCl gradient elution. The protein was concentrated and kept frozen at -80 °C. The yield was ∼2.5 mg of protein from 1 liter of culture. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (24Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Mutagenic oligonucleotides used were CTTTCGCTGGTGGGGCCTGTTCACCCAGCGTGAGCAGGGC and GCCCTGCTCACGCTGGGTGAACAGGCCCCACCAGCGAAAG for Y69F; CTTTCGCTGGTGGGGCCTGGCCACCCAGCGTGAGCAGGGC and GCCCTGCTCACGCTGGGTCGGCAGGCCCCACCAGCGAAAG for Y69A; CTGCAGACCACCGAGGCGAGCGGTGACTGCCCGCGGGTAG and CTACCCGCGGGCAGTCACCGCTCGCCTCGGTGGTCTGCAG for C161S; and CTGCAGACCACCGAGGCGGCCGGTGACTGCCCGCGGGTAG and CTACCCGCGGGCAGTCACCGGCCGCCTCGGTGGTCTGCAG for C161A. In all cases, the mutant genes were sequenced to verify the absence of unintended mutations. Expression and purification of the mutant enzymes was carried out as for wild-type NirA. Enzyme Assay—Wild-type and mutant NirA was assayed for sulfite reductase activity using the artificial electron donor methyl viologen (MV), 2The abbreviations used are: MV, methyl viologen; r.m.s., root mean square. which was reduced by sodium dithionite (15Krueger R.J. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2892-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The assay mixtures contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm sodium sulfite, 0.5 mm MV, and 1.5 mm sodium dithionite in a total volume of 0.8 ml at 22 °C. The reaction was started by the addition of sodium dithionite and followed spectrophotometrically as the consumption of reduced MV at 604 nm. The linear parts of the time curves were used to calculate the overall reaction rate for recombinant wild type and mutant enzymes. The background reoxidation rate of reduced methyl viologen was less than 0.1% of the enzymatic reaction. The extinction coefficient used at this wavelength was 1.4 × 104 m-1 cm-1 (25Asada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3646-3654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of sulfite reductase activity is defined as that amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 μmol of MV/min under assay conditions (15Krueger R.J. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2892-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The reaction product, sulfide, was initially recognized by the typical smell of the developing H2S. For chemical identification of the product, 1 ml of the assay solution, including wild-type or mutant NirA, was added into the wells of a 24-well microtiter plate. The reaction was started by the addition of sodium dithionite, and the well was immediately sealed with coverslips carrying a hanging drop (3 μl) of 1.0 mm NaOH solution to trap the hydrogen sulfide formed. The latter was identified by the addition of 3.6 mm cadmium chloride or 2 mm N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate and 3 mm ferric chloride for the methylene blue assay (26Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) to the drops. The assay for nitrite reductase activity consisted of the same mixture as above, except that nitrite (in the range 5-20 mm) was added instead of sodium sulfite. Nitrite reductase activity was monitored by MV oxidation or directly by the consumption of nitrite. For the latter case, the reaction was stopped at various time intervals, and the concentration of the remaining nitrite was determined spectrophotometrically at 540 nm after the addition of 0.02% (w/v) sulfanilamide and 0.002% (w/v) N-(1-naphtyl)ethylenediamine (27.Snell, F. D., and Snell, C. T. (1949) in Colorimetric Methods of Analysis (van Nostrand, R., ed) Vol. 3, pp. 804-805, Princeton, NJGoogle Scholar). Control experiments verified that components of the assay mixture did not interfere with the determination of nitrite concentration. Mass Spectrometry—The samples were in-gel digested using porcine sequence grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) (28Hellman U. Jollès P. Jörnvall H. Proteomics in Functional Genomics: Protein Structure Analysis. Birkhauser Verlag AG, Basel, Switzerland2000: 43-54Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The digests were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser dissociation ionization time of flight mass spectrometry on a Bruker Ultraflex TOF/TOF spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) using α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid as matrix and the instrument setting optimized for analytes up to m/z 3500. Internal calibration was achieved with the autolytic fragments of trypsin. Data were analyzed via GPMAW (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark) Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of NirA were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. 2 μl of the protein solution (10-14 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride) were mixed with 2 μl of well solution, containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH range 8.2-8.7, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, and equilibrated against 1.0 ml of the well solution. Clusters of needle-shaped, brown crystals appeared after 3 days at room temperature. Rod-shaped single crystals suitable for x-ray structure analysis were obtained by streak seeding of freshly made drops (protein concentration 7 mg/ml) equilibrated for 1 day against the above mother liquor. X-ray data were collected from crystals after direct transfer into a nitrogen gas stream at 110 K, at station ID14-1, ESRF (Grenoble, France) and beam line ID711 at MAX-lab (Lund, Sweden). The x-ray data were processed and scaled with the programs MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 suit (29Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P21, with cell dimensions a = 59.9 Å, b = 83.3 Å, c = 108.8 Å, and β = 102.2°. A second crystal form in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 84.25 Å, b = 115.35 Å, c = 114.7 Å was obtained under identical conditions. In both cases, the asymmetric unit contains two molecules, with a solvent content of ∼45%.

Open table in a new tab Molecular Replacement and Crystallographic Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (30Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4148) Google Scholar), initially in space group P21. A polyserine model of CysI from E. coli (19Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1995; 270: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession code 2gep) with residues 158-172, 200-208, 268-274, and 554-569 omitted was used as a search model. The best solution for the monoclinic NirA data set had a correlation coefficient of 0.266 and an R-factor of 55% with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Initial rounds of rigid body refinement using Refmac5 (31Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar) resulted in a drop of the R-factor by 5%. The siroheme molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster were excluded from these refinement cycles, and the correctness of the molecular replacement solution was confirmed by electron density for the cofactors appearing at the expected positions. Manual rebuilding of the model was carried out with the program O (32Jones T.A. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), based on σA weighted 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps (33Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), and refinement was continued with the program Refmac5 (31Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1997; 53: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar). Tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied in order to limit the number of parameters, except for a few loop regions with slightly different conformations. The structure determination for the orthorhombic NirA crystal form was carried out in a similar way, except that an initial NirA model from the monoclinic data set was used for the molecular replacement with residues 10-94 excluded from the search model. This stretch of the polypeptide chain was gradually rebuilt during refinement. CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The protein models were analyzed with PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J. J. Appl.

The atomic coordinates and structure factors for NirA have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 1zj8 (space group P212121) and 1zj9 (space group P21). Characterization of Recombinant NirA—Recombinant NirA from M. tuberculosis has a brown color and shows the characteristic absorption spectrum of [Fe4-S4]- and siroheme-containing sulfite/nitrite reductases in the oxidized state (15Krueger R.J. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2892-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Curdt I. Singh B.B. Jakoby M. Hachtel W. Böhme H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 41Kuznetsova S. Knaff D.B. Hirasawa M. Setif P. Mattioli T.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10765-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Purified recombinant NirA is catalytically active as a sulfite reductase and is able to reduce sulfite to sulfide using the non-physiological electron donor methyl viologen. The reaction product sulfide was chemically identified by the characteristic yellow, insoluble cadmium sulfide and by the methylene blue assay (26Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The enzyme has a specific activity of 2.0 units/mg protein, comparable with sulfite reductases from other organisms (13Crane B.R. Getzoff E.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 744-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Krueger R.J. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2892-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We could not detect any decrease in the concentration of nitrite in this assay. Reduction of the artificial electron donor methyl viologen by dithionite results in the formation of equimolar amounts of sulfite as a by-product, which will compete with nitrite as a substrate. The failure of the enzyme to reduce nitrite under these conditions, even when added in 10-fold excess over sodium dithionite, shows that NirA has a pronounced preference for sulfite over nitrite as substrate. 3Members of the SiR/NiR family usually are able to reduce both sulfite and nitrite, albeit at different rates. Absorption spectra of NirA recorded in the presence of nitrite or hydroxylamine, a postulated intermediate in the reduction of nitrite, show the same spectral changes as those described for spinach nitrite reductase (41Kuznetsova S. Knaff D.B. Hirasawa M. Setif P. Mattioli T.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10765-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 53Vega J.M. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 896-909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicated that NirA is able to bind nitrite and hydroxylamine and thus might be able to reduce nitrite although at lower rates than sulfite. Gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering suggest that NirA is a monomer in solution (data not shown), a finding that is also consistent with the crystallographic analysis (see below). The Electron Density Map and Quality of the Model—The structure of NirA was solved by molecular replacement in two crystal forms, each containing two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Table I). Most parts of the polypeptide chain, including the iron-sulfur cluster and the siroheme cofactor, are well defined in electron density. The real space correlation to the electron density maps is in the range of 0.87-0.92 for both protein chains and space groups. The N-terminal His tag and the first nine residues of NirA are not seen in the electron density map. Less well defined regions of the polypeptide chain include several surface loops (residues 32-35, 51-55, 192-200, and 487-490). The final model consists of 8643 nonhydrogen protein atoms (two chains comprising residues 10-555) of NirA, two [Fe4-S4] clusters, two siroheme molecules, two chloride ions, and 20 water molecules. The stereochemistry of the model is as expected for this resolution (Table I). Superposition of the refined models of NirA from the two space groups gives an r.m.s. deviation of 0.45 Å, with the deviations mainly located in the weakly defined loop regions. Overall Structure of M. tuberculosis NirA—In solution and in the crystal, NirA is present as a monomer. The buried accessible surface areas for the enzyme molecules in both crystal forms are on the order of 550 Å2, corresponding to 2% of the total accessible surface area. This value is typical for crystal contacts rather than for a dimer interface. The NirA molecule consists of three α/β domains: the parachute (19Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1995; 270: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) domain (residues 1-159 and 331-405), the middle domain (residues 160-330), and the [Fe4-S4]-binding C-terminal domain (residues 406-555) (Fig. 2, A a"
https://openalex.org/W2114503487,"The transport of nucleotide sugars from the cytoplasm into the Golgi apparatus is mediated by specialized type III proteins, the nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs). Transport assays carried out in vitro with Golgi vesicles from mammalian cells showed specific uptake for a total of eight nucleotide sugars. When this study was started, NSTs with transport activities for all but two nucleotide sugars (UDP-Xyl and UDP-Glc) had been cloned. Aiming at identifying these elusive NSTs, bioinformatic methods were used to display putative NST sequences in the human genome. Ten open reading frames were identified, cloned, and heterologously expressed in yeast. Transport capabilities for UDP-Glc and UDP-Xyl were determined with Golgi vesicles isolated from transformed cells. Although a potential UDP-Glc transporter could not be identified due to the high endogenous transport background, the measurement of UDP-Xyl transport was possible on a zero background. Vesicles from yeast cells expressing the human gene SLC35B4 showed specific uptake of UDP-Xyl, and subsequent testing of other nucleotide sugars revealed a second activity for UDP-GlcNAc. Expression of the epitope-tagged SLC35B4 in mammalian cells demonstrated strict Golgi localization. Because decarboxylation of UDP-GlcA is known to produce UDP-Xyl directly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi lumen, our data demonstrate that two ways exist to deliver UDP-Xyl to the Golgi apparatus.

Ten open reading frames were identified, cloned, and heterologously expressed in yeast. Transport capabilities for UDP-Glc and UDP-Xyl were determined with Golgi vesicles isolated from transformed cells. Although a potential UDP-Glc transporter could not be identified due to the high endogenous transport background, the measurement of UDP-Xyl transport was possible on a zero background. Vesicles from yeast cells expressing the human gene SLC35B4 showed specific uptake of UDP-Xyl, and subsequent testing of other nucleotide sugars revealed a second activity for UDP-GlcNAc. Expression of the epitope-tagged SLC35B4 in mammalian cells demonstrated strict Golgi localization. Because decarboxylation of UDP-GlcA is known to produce UDP-Xyl directly in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi lumen, our data demonstrate that two ways exist to deliver UDP-Xyl to the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is the major compartment involved in the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates (glycoproteins, glycolipids, proteoglycans). Glycosyltransferases that reside in the Golgi apparatus are type II membrane proteins with lumenally oriented catalytic domains (1Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Their activity depends on the delivery of nucleotide sugars to the compartmental lumen, a function accomplished by nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) 1The abbreviations used are: NST, nucleotide sugar transporter; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; SLC35, solute carrier family 35. (for a review, see Ref. 2Berninsone P.M. Hirschberg C.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The distribution patterns of NSTs and transporters of other substrates needed in posttranslational modifications in the Golgi (e.g. PAPS and ATP) have been intensively investigated using purified vesicles in the presence of radioactively labeled substrates (3Carey D.J.

In these studies, Golgi vesicles isolated from mammalian cells were shown to transport UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal, UDP-Xyl, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcA, CMP-Sia, GDP-Fuc, ATP, and PAPS (for a review, see Ref. 9Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Further biochemical characterization of the transport proteins demonstrated that they act as antiporters exchanging the substrates for the respective mono-nucleotides (7Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Capasso J.M. Keenan T.W. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5233-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A breakthrough came with the cloning of the first NSTs. By complementation cloning in characterized cell mutants, the UDP-GlcNAc transporter was cloned from yeast (11Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the CMP-Sia and UDP-Gal transporters were cloned from mammals (12Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All isolated NST genes encoded homologous type III membrane proteins. Ma et al. (14Ma D. Russell D.G. Beverley S.M. Turco S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3799-3805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) noted first that the gene family not only included NSTs but also proteins of the inner chloroplast membrane transporting other metabolites (15Flügge U.I. Fischer K. Gross A. Sebald W. Lottspeich F. Eckerskorn C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 16Eicks M. Maurino V. Knappe S. Flügge U.I. Fischer K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 512-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nowadays, this gene family is known as the drug-metabolite transporter superfamily, which comprises solute transporters from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (17Jack D.L. Yang N.M. Saier Jr., M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3620-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). NSTs preserve their specificity when expressed in heterologous systems. Initially demonstrated for the murine CMP-Sia transporter by Berninsone et al. (18Berninsone P. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12616-12619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), this aspect has been used later to clone NSTs from different species. For instance, the canine UDP-GlcNAc transporter was cloned by complementation of a transport-deficient Klyveromyces lactis strain (11Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the Caenorhabditis elegans GDP-Fuc transporter (19Lühn K. Wild M.K. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Vestweber D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) was cloned by complementation of human fibroblasts isolated from a patient with congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIc. More recently, two UDP-Gal transporters from Arabidopsis (20Bakker H. Routier F. Oelmann S. Jordi W. Lommen A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bosch D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have been identified by complementation of the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell mutant Lec8 (21Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, the architectural conservation, which allows the identification of putative NSTs in the gene data bases, and the functional conservation, which allows specificity testing in a low background system such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (22Berninsone P. Hwang H.Y. Zemtseva I. Horvitz H.R. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3738-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), have accelerated the cloning and functional characterization of NSTs. Unexpectedly, the testing of heterologously expressed NSTs demonstrated that many of these proteins transport more than one substrate. Functional activities determined for human NSTs are listed in Table II.Table IIMembers of the solute carrier family 35 (SLC35) are summarized and their specificity is indicated Open table in a new tab In addition, the table highlights all human members of the drug-metabolite transporter family (17Jack D.L. Yang N.M. Saier Jr., M.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3620-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), which have been recently assembled in the solute carrier family 35 (SLC35) (23Ishida N. Kawakita M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Besides characterized NSTs, this family comprises the PAPS transporter and numerous genes with unknown functions. Here we describe the characterization of gene SLC35B4 as encoding a Golgi localized NST with dual specificity for UDP-Xyl and UDP-GlcNAc. With this first molecular characterization of a UDP-Xyl transport protein, we confirmed earlier biochemical data (24Nuwayhid N. Glaser J.H. Johnson J.C. Conrad H.E. Hauser S.C. Hirschberg C.B. J.

Materials—Radioactive nucleotide-sugars UDP-[1-3H]Glc, UDP-[1-3H]Gal, UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc, UDP-[1-3H]GalNAc, GDP-[2-3H]Fuc, CMP-[9-3H]NeuAc, UDP-[14C(U)]GlcA, and UDP-[14C(U)]Xyl were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cold Nucleotide sugars were from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, except for UDP-GalNAc, UDP-GlcA, and UDP-Xyl, which were from Sigma. Zymolyase 100T was obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH), and monoclonal anti-mouse antibody M5 directed against the FLAG sequence MDYKDDDDK was from Sigma. A rabbit antiserum against the catalytic domain of the α-mannosidase II (26Moremen K.W. Touster O. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16876-16885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Kelly Moremen, University of Georgia, Athens, GA. Multiple Alignments, Transmembrane Domain Prediction, and Phylogenetic Analysis—Human members of the SLC35 family were identified by WU-BLAST2 searches in the protein databases using various known members of the drug-metabolite transporter superfamily as input. Searches were done at protein level and limited to the proteins predicted from the human genomic sequence. The TMHMM server v 2.0 was used for prediction of transmembrane helices in protein (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Technical University of Denmark). The multiple alignment and building of the phylogenetic tree of members of the human SLC35 family was done using the online clustalW program at the EMBL-EBI (Hinxton, UK). Yeast Strains and Plasmids—S. cerevisiae strain YPH500 (MATα ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ 63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) and BY4741 (MATa; his3D1; leu2D0; met15D0; ura3D0; YEL004w::kanMX4 (EUROSCARF, European S. cerevisiae Archive for Functional Analysis; Frankfurt, Germany) were used for yeast expression experiments. A copper-inducible yeast expression vector was constructed by replacing the Gal-inducible promoter in pYES2/NT-C (Invitrogen) by the CUP1 promoter of pYEX-BESN (27Segawa H. Ishida N. Takegawa K. Kawakita M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). pYEX-BESN was a generous gift from Dr. Masao Kawakita (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan). The primers 5′-GCT TAC TAG TCT TTT GCT GGC ATT TCT TTT AGA AGC AAA AAG-3′ and 5′-TAC TAA GCT TCC AAT TCG CTG AAT ATT TTA TG-3′, containing SpeI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, were used to amplify the CUP1 promoter from pYEX-BESN (28Segawa H. Kawakita M. Ishida N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR fragment was digested and subcloned into pYES2/NT-C. The His tag encoding sequence contained in pYES2 was replaced by either the linker 5′-AGC TTA CCA TGG ACT ACA AGG ACG ATG ACG ATA AGG TAC-3′ after HindIII/KpnI digestion or the linker 5′-AGC TTA CCA TGG ACT ACA AGG ACG ATG ACG ATA AGG-3′ after HindIII/EcoRI digestion, resulting in the vectors pYEScupFLAGK and pYEScupFLAGE, respectively. These vectors drive the expression of N-terminally FLAG-tagged proteins. Human members of the SLC35 family were amplified by PCR from I.M.A.G.E. clones (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (29Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) obtained via RZPD, Berlin, Germany) and cloned in pYEScupFLAGK using KpnI or BamHI at the 5′ side and XbaI at the 3′ side or in pYEScupFLAGE using EcoRI at the 5′ side and XbaI at the 3′ side. Table I lists the identification numbers of I.M.A.G.E. clones, the systematic gene names as allocated in the SLC35 family, primers and restriction sites used to amplify and clone the putative NST cDNAs, and names of resulting vector constructs.Table IVector constructs containing SLC35 family members used in this studyIMAGE IDSLC35PCR-primer sequences and restriction sitesVector163552A2CTATGGATCCAACATGGCAGCGGTTGGGGC (BamHI)pYEScupFLAGKGTAGTCTAGAATTGCTGCCAGCCCTCACT (XbaI)A22961449A4ACTAGGATCCAGTGTAGAGGATGGGGG (BamHI)pYEScupFLAGKTTGTTCTAGACTAGCGGCTGCCATAGTA (XbaI)A45302877A5CATAGGTACCTGAAAAACAGTGCTGTAGTCAT (KpnI)pYEScupFLAGKCTATTCTAGAGTTAGAAAGTATCTTCATCTG (XbaI)A55296591B1CATAGAATTCGCCTCTAGCAGCTCCCTGGT (EcoRI)pYEScupFLAGECTATTCTAGACTAGTGGGATGTCTTCTTA (XbaI)B14890949B2GTCTGAATTCATGGACGCCAGATGGTGG (EcoRI)pYEScupFLAGEGTAGTCTAGATCAAACCTTCTGCACAGGAGA (XbaI)B24363961B3CATGGATCCGATCTCAAGTTCAACAATTCCA (BamHI)pYEScupFLAGKCTATTCTAGAATCATACCAGTGATGGTAGTCT (XbaI)B3pYEScupFLAGK3904672B4CATGGATCCCGCCCGGCCTTGGCGGTGGGCCT (BamHI)B4CTATTCTAGACAGGCCTCAGTTCTTCTTGCTG (XbaI)pcDNA3FLAGKB43920710C2CATGGATCCGGGAGGTGGGCCCTCGATGT (BamHI)pYEScupFLAGKCTATTCTAGATCACTGCTGCCCCTGGGCCA (XbaI)C24810919E3CATAGAATTCGCATTGCTGGTGGACCGA (EcoRI)pYEScupFLAGECTATTCTAGAATTAAGGACGTTGTGCCAGT (XbaI)E31869574F6CATGGATCCGCCTGGACCAAGTACCAGCT (BamHI)pYEScupFLAGKCTATTCTAGACTCAGCTGGCATCATTGATGGGA (XbaI)F6 Open table in a new tab Yeast Transformation, Golgi Preparation, and in Vitro Transport Assay—Yeast cells were transformed using the lithium acetate method provided by Invitrogen. After transformation, yeast cells were cultured on selective medium containing 0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids but supplemented with l-leucine, l-histidine, l-tryptophan, l-lysine, adenine, and 2% glucose. Cells were grown to A600 0.8, supplemented with copper-sulfate to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and cultured for another 2 h. The subcellular fractionation of yeast cells and the in vitro transport assays were performed essentially as described (28Segawa H. Kawakita M. Ishida N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Aoki K. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21555-21561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, cultured cells were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 1,500 × g) and washed twice with ice-cold 10 mm NaN3. The weight of wet cells was measured, and cells were resuspended in zymolyase buffer (3 ml/g of cells; 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5; 1.4 m sorbitol; 10 mm NaN3 and 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.6 mg/ml of zymolyase-100T. The suspension was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation (5 min at 1,000 × g) and resuspended in lysis buffer (4 ml/g of cells; 10 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4; 0.8 m sorbitol; 1 mm EDTA) containing complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After homogenization with 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, the lysate was centrifuged (5 min, 1,500 × g) to remove unlysed cells and debris. Endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi-rich fractions were then obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min (endoplasmic reticulum) and 100,000 × g for 1 h (Golgi). The 100,000 × g pellet was carefully resuspended in lysis buffer (0.8 ml/g of cells), and aliquots of 100 μl were snap-frozen and kept at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA™ kit (Pierce). For transport assay reactions, equal volumes (50 μl of each) of 2 mm radioactive nucleotide sugar (2,000-4,000 dpm/pmol) in assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; 0.8 m sorbitol; 2 mm MgCl2) and vesicle preparation (equivalent to 75-100 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 s at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by dilution with 1 ml of assay buffer containing 1 μm respective cold nucleotide sugar. The separation of vesicles and nucleotide sugars was achieved by filtration trough nitrocellulose filter (MF™ membrane filters Millipore, Bedford, MA). Filters were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold assay buffer containing the corresponding cold nucleotide sugar at a concentration of 1 μm, and radioactivity associated with the vesicular fraction was measured by liquid scintillation in a LS 5000CE counter (Beckman Coulter). Golgi vesicles from yeast cells transformed with an empty vector were used to measure endogenous transport. The endogenous transport of UDP-Glc was used to control the quality of vesicles. Transport values for each construct were calculated as mean from two independent experiments using independently prepared membrane fractions. In each experiment, nucleotide sugars were assayed in duplicate with the same vesicle preparation. Mammalian Cell Lines, Transfection, and Staining Procedures—Fibroblasts defective in the Golgi GDP-Fuc transport isolated from a leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II patient (19Lühn K. Wild M.K. Eckhardt M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Vestweber D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) were cultured and transfected as described (31Lühn K. Laskowska A. Pielage J.

The CHO cell lines Lec8 (21Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Oelmann S. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol.

Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Complementation of Lec8 and 6B2 cells was determined by cell surface immunostaining as described in Refs. 12Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. Studies to determine the subcellular localization of the recombinant FLAG-SLC35B4 in mammalian cells were carried out with CHO-K1 cells (ATCC CCL-61). Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, transfected with Lipofectamine as described above, and analyzed by immunofluorescence. Therefore, cells 2 days after transfection were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 30 min with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After the permeabilization step, samples were incubated with the respective primary antibodies (anti-FLAG tag M5 and rabbit anti-α-mannosidase II). After three washings (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20), cells were incubated with anti-mouse IgCy3 and anti-rabbit Ig-Alexa 488 for 1 h at room temperature. After three additional washes in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 and a final wash in phosphate-buffered saline, slides were briefly rinsed in water, mounted in Mowiol, and analyzed under a Leica DM IRBE. Identification of Putative Human Nucleotide Sugar Transporters—When this study was started, six out of the expected eight Golgi nucleotide sugar transport activities had been identified (12Eckhardt M.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and it had been highlighted that NST form a family of structurally conserved proteins. Characterized members of the drug-metabolite transporter family were, therefore, used as templates to search the human genome data bases for the existence of additional homologous sequences. The cut-off was set for proteins with a length sufficient to accommodate the 10 transmembrane domains expected for NSTs (36Eckhardt M. Gotza B. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8779-8787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In these searches, we identified 17 sequences of which five were known. Sequences identified in our search are displayed in Table II as part of the recently described SLC35 family (23Ishida N. Kawakita M. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All, except clone C2ORF18, overlay with listed SLC35 family members. A phylogenetic analysis carried out including the newly identified gene C2ORF18 demonstrates that it is a sixth member of subfamily SLC35F (Table II), which is most homologous to the plant purine transporters (37Gillissen B.

While this study was in progress, the genes with the numbers SLC35B2 and SLC35D2 have been shown to represent the PAPS transporter (38Kamiyama S. Suda T. Ueda R. Suzuki M. Okubo R. Kikuchi N.

Functional Characterization of SLC35 Family Members—To identify NSTs with transport activities for UDP-Glc and UDP-Xyl, we decided to heterologously express the candidate genes in S. cerevisiae and measure transport of the nucleotide sugars in vitro with Golgi fractions isolated from transformed cells. PCR fragments harboring the complete open reading frames were subcloned into modified pYES2/NT-C expression vectors downstream of a FLAG sequence tag to enable detection of recombinant proteins (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I). The characterized gene SLC35A2 (UDP-Gal/UDP-Gal-NAc transporter (13Miura N. Ishida N. Hoshino M. Yamauchi M. Hara T. Ayusawa D. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Segawa H. Kawakita M. Ishida N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), cloned into the same vector system, was used as a control. For 9 out of the 12 newly identified gene family members, we were able to clone the complete open reading frames from EST clones. Obtained constructs are listed and described in Table I, and gene names are shaded in Table II. Proteins were expressed in the S. cerevisiae strain YPH500, and Golgi-rich microsomal fractions were isolated and used to measure transport activity with radioactively labeled sugar nucleotides. The Western blot shown in Fig. 1C demonstrates that all proteins were expressed. None of the expressed proteins was, however, able to increase UDP-Glc transport significantly over the high endogenous transport level (Fig. 1A). In contrast, endogenous transport of UDP-Xyl was virtually absent in vesicles isolated from mock-transfected YPH500 cells (Fig. 1B; background 1.1 pmol/mg/min) but rose to 6.8 pmol/mg/min in the vesicle fraction isolated from SLC35B4 transformed cells. All other candidate genes, including the characterized human UDP-Gal/UDP-GalNAc transporter, did not significantly change UDP-Xyl background transport. SLC35B4 Encodes an NST with Transport Activity for UDP-Xyl and UDP-GlcNAc—Because many of the NSTs cloned and functionally characterized today exhibit transport activity for more than a single nucleotide sugar, we decided to analyze SLC35B4 for additional substrates. As shown in Fig. 2, a transport assay was carried out with seven radioactively labeled nucleotide sugars. The high endogenous transport of UDP-Glc demonstrated the high quality of the vesicle preparation. Although no transport activity was found with the UDP-activated sugars Gal, GalNAc, and GlcA, the presence of FLAG-SLC35B4 clearly increases the transport activity for UDP-Xyl (6.2-fold vector control) and UDP-GlcNAc (2.6-fold vector control). In the case of GDP-Fuc, rather high transport values were observed already in vesicles isolated from mock-transfected cells. Transport values were, however, not altered in the presence of FLAG-SLC35B4, thus arguing against the recognition and transport of GDP-Fuc. The presented data identify the human SLC35B4 gene as dually active NST with specificity for UDP-Xyl and UDP-GlcNAc. Because complementation cloning in characterized mutant cell lines provides a standard technique in our laboratory, potential transport capabilities of SLC35B4 were additionally tested in existing mutants. Included in this test were (i) CHO 6B2 cells, which cells belong to the Lec2 complementation group defective in the CMP-Sia transporter (12Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7572-7576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar); (ii) CHO Lec8 cells, which are defective in the UDP-Gal transporter (21Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J.

The vector construct pcDNA3FLAGKB4 (Table I) driving the expression of an N-terminally FLAG-tagged protein was used in transient transfection studies. Although complementation of the respective cells was achieved with the positive controls (SLC35A1, SLC35A2, and SLC35C1 cloned into the same vector), and indirect immunofluorescence with the anti-FLAG tag antibody M5 demonstrated expression of FLAG-SLC35B4 in all cell lines, the latter was unable to restore the wild type glycosylation patterns. These data exclude the transport of CMP-Sia, UDP-Gal, and GDP-Fuc by SLC35B4. Confirmation of UDP-Xyl and UDP-GlcNAc Transport Activity—Although the data presented so far typify SLC35B4 as a dual transporter for UDP-Xyl and UDP-GlcNAc, the endogenous transport for UDP-GlcNAc did not allow us to directly compare the two transpo"

However, the mechanisms involved in determining their specificities of action in cells remain unclear. Recent evidence has raised the possibility that RGS proteins may interact directly with G-protein-coupled receptors to modulate their activity. By using biochemical, fluorescent imaging, and functional approaches, we found that RGS2 binds directly and selectively to the third intracellular loop of the α1A-adrenergic receptor (AR) in vitro, and is recruited by the unstimulated α1A-AR to the plasma membrane in cells to inhibit receptor and Gq/11 signaling. This interaction was specific, because RGS2 did not interact with the highly homologous α1B- or α1D-ARs, and the closely related RGS16 did not interact with any α1-ARs. The N terminus of RGS2 was required for association with α1A-ARs and inhibition of signaling, and amino acids Lys219, Ser220, and Arg238 within the α1A-AR i3 loop were found to be essential for this interaction. These findings demonstrate that certain RGS proteins can directly interact with preferred G-protein-coupled receptors to modulate their signaling with a high degree of specificity.

Signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; RGS, regulators of G-protein signaling; NE, norepinephrine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AR, adrenergic receptor; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; InsP, inositol phosphate. must be tightly regulated in cells to maintain functional specificity. Recent studies have identified a large family of proteins, the Regulators of G-protein Signaling (RGS), which bind Gα-GTP to increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis and rapidly terminate responses (1Berman D.M.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), it was initially postulated that the specificity of RGS function would be controlled by formation of individual RGS/Gα pairs. However, subsequent studies showed that many RGS proteins, in particular most members of the B/R4 subfamily (RGS1-5, -8, -13, -16, and -18), could nonselectively bind and inhibit Gαi/o and Gαq/11 function in reconstituted systems (5Hollinger S.

Recent studies suggest that RGS proteins may interact with GPCRs to regulate their function (8Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I. Yu K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J.

Huang J. Liang J. Chasse S.A. Jones A.M. Siderovski D.P. Science. 2003; 301: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), indicating that RGS proteins and GPCRs are physically and functionally coupled in plants, and suggests that they may have evolved as separate genes in higher organisms allowing for the formation of specific paired complexes. Consistent with this idea, we showed recently (16Bernstein L.S. Ramineni S. Hague C. Cladman W. Chidiac P. Levey A.I. Hepler J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21248-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) that purified RGS2 binds directly to the third intracellular (i3) loops of the Gαq-coupled M1, M3, and M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors but not the Gαi-coupled M2 and M4. Binding of RGS2 to the M1 receptor was shown to recruit recombinant RGS2 and to regulate the activity of endogenous Gαq/11 in cell membranes (16Bernstein L.S. Ramineni S. Hague C. Cladman W. Chidiac P. Levey A.I. Hepler J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21248-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data support the idea that RGS proteins form direct functional complexes with preferred GPCRs in order to modulate the signaling properties of these receptors and their linked G-proteins (17Sierra D.A. Popov S. Wilkie T.M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Hepler J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, previous work has not yet demonstrated direct RGS interactions with full-length receptors in intact systems, the specific amino acids within a receptor that bind the RGS protein, and the general applicability of this phenomenon across GPCRs. α1-Adrenergic receptors (ARs) mediate responses to norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (19Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). There are three α1-AR subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D) which, like M1 receptors, also activate Gαq and release intracellular Ca2+. α1-ARs play an essential role in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure and are an important target for treatment of hypertension (19Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 20Hague C. Chen Z. Uberti M. Minneman K.P. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, a recent report showed that RGS2 knock-out mice have a strongly hypertensive phenotype, with increased mean arterial pressure, renovascular abnormalities, and persistent constriction of the peripheral vasculature (21Heximer S.P. Knutsen R.H. Sun X. Kaltenbronn K.M. Rhee M.H. Peng N. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Penninger J.M. Muslin A.J. Steinberg T.H. Wyss J.M. Mecham R.P. Blumer K.J. J. Clin.

Mendelsohn M.E. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1506-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the possibility that RGS2 might interact specifically with α1-AR subtypes to modulate their signaling. Unexpectedly, we found that RGS2 binds specifically to the i3 loop of the α1A-AR but not the closely related α1B- or α1D-AR. This interaction requires specific amino acids in the α1A-AR i3 loop and results in inhibition of agonist-stimulated responses in intact cells. The findings of this study demonstrate that specific RGS proteins interact directly with preferred GPCRs and that this interaction is essential for controlling RGS specificity and function. Constructs-GST-α1-i3 Constructs—α1A-i3, α1B-i3, and α1D-i3 loop constructs were originally cloned into the pET41b vector to encode a fusion protein with an N-terminal GST tag and a C-terminal His tag. Each receptor i3 loop was amplified from corresponding regions of the human full-length receptor as follows: α1A, amino acids 213-260; α1B, amino acids 233-280; α1D, amino acids 283-334. α1A and α1D were amplified as BamHI/XhoI fragments, and α1B was amplified as an EcoRI/XhoI fragment. In order to perform pull-down assays with purified His-tagged RGS proteins, fragments encoding the i3 loops of α1A- and α1B-ARs were subcloned further into the pGEX4T vector to eliminate the His tag. α1A was amplified as a BamHI/XhoI fragment, and α1B was amplified as an EcoRI/XhoI fragment and cloned in-frame with an N-terminal GST tag. α1A/B i3 Loop Chimeras—α1A/B i3 loop chimeras were created by using a nested primer PCR strategy (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Argentine J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and inserted into the pGEX4T-1 vector. The α1A/B chimera encodes amino acids 214-239 of α1A fused to amino acids 259-280 of α1B. The α1B/A chimera encodes amino acids 234-258 of α1B fused to amino acids 239-260 of α1A. The junction of these chimeras occurs between conserved lysine-asparagine residues. The α1A/B 1-8 constructs encode single, double, or triple amino acid substitutions of the α1A-i3 sequence with α1B placed into the GST-α1A/B chimeric template. Substitutions were made as denoted below, where the amino acid number corresponds to position of the residue in the context of the full-length α1A-AR receptor sequence: α1A/B-1, E214T/S215T; α1A/B-2, R216K/G217N; α1A/B-3, K219E/S220A; α1A/B-4, L222V/K223M; α1A/B-5, T224K/D225E/K226M; α1A/B-6, D228N; α1A/B-7, E230K/Q231E/V232L; α1A/B-8, R238S. The mutations demonstrating the largest loss in RGS2 binding capacity were then inserted into the full-length α1A-AR in the pDT vector using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) for use in functional assays examining RGS2 inhibition of [3H]InsP formation. RGS Constructs—RGS2-HA, RGS16-HA, N2/RGS16-HA, RGS2-His, RGS16-His, RGS2-GFP, and RGS16-GFP were created as described previously (16Bernstein L.S. Ramineni S. Hague C. Cladman W. Chidiac P.

N-terminal HA epitope-tagged human α1-ARs were produced as described previously (24Vicentic A. Robeva A. Rogge G. Uberti M. Minneman K.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Induction and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST-α1-AR i3 loop fusion proteins (GST-α1A-i3, GST-α1B-i3, GST-α1D-i3, GST-α1A/B-i3, and GST-α1B/A-i3 chimeras and GST α1A/B-i3 mutants) were transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (16Bernstein L.S.

Cell Cultures and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with sodium pyruvate supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Confluent plates were subcultured at a ratio of 1:5 for transfection. HEK293 cells were transfected with 3 μg of DNA of each construct for 24 h using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen), and cells were used for experimentation 48-72 h after transfection. Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CellGro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 1× nonessential amino acids (CellGro), and penicillin/streptomycin. Preparation of Cell Lysates—To produce cell lysates containing RGS-HA proteins, wild-type Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells were grown to 80-90% confluency in 10-cm dishes and transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent, and cell lysates were harvested as described previously (16Bernstein L.S.

RGS Pull-down Assays—Pull-down assays were performed using a modified version of the procedure described previously (16Bernstein L.S. Ramineni S. Hague C. Cladman W. Chidiac P. Levey A.I. Hepler J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21248-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The single modification of this assay involved pull-downs using RGS-His proteins, in which 30 mm imidazole and 80 mm NaCl were included in the buffer to control for differences in the buffers among the purified RGS proteins. Immunoblots—Immunoblots were performed as described previously (16Bernstein L.S. Ramineni S. Hague C. Cladman W. Chidiac P. Levey A.I. Hepler J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21248-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In brief, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 5% milk, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.02% sodium azide) 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were probed with either mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance) or mouse anti-His (Qiagen) antibodies diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer for 1-2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Rockland) diluted 1:20,000 in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20. Protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence and exposed to film. Laser Confocal Microscopy—Cells transiently transfected with HA- or GFP-tagged constructs were grown on sterile coverslips, fixed for 30 min with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% normal horse serum (PBS+). For anti-HA immunostaining, fixed coverslips were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal horse serum) containing 0.01% Triton X-100 to permeabilize cells. Anti-HA antibody (1:1000 dilution) was added to coverslips overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer, washed three times with PBS+, and incubated with rhodamine red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS+ and mounted onto slides using Vectashield mounting medium. Cells were scanned with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) as described previously (25Volpicelli L.A. Lah J.J. Levey A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47590-47598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For detecting GFP, fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was excited using an argon laser at a wavelength of 488 nm, and the absorbed wavelength was detected for 510-520 nm. For detecting rhodamine fluorescence, a helium-neon laser at a wavelength of 522 nm was used. Measurement of [3H]InsP Formation—Accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates (InsPs) was determined in confluent 96-well plates. Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol for 24 h, and production of [3H]InsP was determined by modification of a protocol described previously (45Mittmann C. Schuler C. Chung C.H. Hoppner G. Nose M. Kehrl J.H. Wieland T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After prelabeling, medium containing myo-[3H]inositol was removed, and 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (in mm: NaCl 120, KCl 5.5, CaCl2 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.2, MgCl2 1.2, NaHCO3 20, glucose 11, Na2EDTA 0.029) containing 10 mm LiCl was gently added to each well. Cells were incubated with or without 100 μm NE for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 500 μl of methanol, and samples were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. Samples were subjected to anion exchange chromatography to isolate [3H]InsPs, which were quantified by scintillation counting. Percent hydrolysis of total myo-[3H]inositol incorporated into lipid converted into [3H]InsPs was counted and expressed as mean ± S.E. Mean values were compared using the one-sample t test, with a p value less than 0.01 considered significant. Radioligand Binding—Confluent 150-mm plates were washed with PBS and harvested by scraping. Cells were collected by centrifugation, homogenized with a Polytron, centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min, and resuspended in PBS. Radioligand-binding sites were measured by saturation analysis of specific binding of the α1-AR antagonist radioligand 125I-BE2254 (20-800 pm). Nonspecific binding was defined as binding in the presence of 10 μm phentolamine. The pharmacological specificity of radioligand-binding sites was determined by displacement of 125I-BE2254 (50-70 pm) by NE. Data were analyzed using nonlinear regression (26Theroux T.L. Esbenshade T.A. Peavy R.D. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1376-1387PubMed Google Scholar). RGS2 Selectively Associates with the i3 Loop of the α1A-AR—To determine whether selected B/R4 RGS proteins directly associate with α1-ARs, we examined the capacity of closely related RGS2 and RGS16 to associate with the i3 loops of all three subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D) by using pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 1, RGS2 was capable of binding to the α1A-i3, but not to the α1B-i3 or α1D-i3, whereas RGS16 did not associate with any of the three α1-AR subtype i3 loops. To identify a specific RGS2 binding domain within the α1A-i3, we created α1A/B-i3 chimeras encoding amino acids 214-239 of α1A fused to amino acids 259-280 of α1B and α1B/A chimeras encoding amino acids 234-258 of α1B fused to amino acids 239-260 of α1A (Fig. 1B). Chimeras were then fused to GST and tested for their capacity to associate with RGS2-His by using pull-down assays. Most interestingly, we found that RGS2 robustly associated with the GST-α1A/B chimera (Fig. 1C), indicating that the N-terminal half of the α1A-i3 contains an RGS2-binding motif. In contrast, we found RGS2 interacted very weakly or not at all with the GST-α1B/A chimera, suggesting the first 26 amino acids of the i3 loop is predominantly responsible for RGS2 interaction. Therefore, these data indicate that an RGS2-binding motif may be contained within the proximal domain of the α1A-i3. RGS2 Co-localizes at the Plasma Membrane with α1A-ARs in HEK293 Cells—To determine whether RGS2 associates with α1A-ARs in a cellular context, we co-transfected GFP-tagged RGS proteins with HA-tagged α1-ARs into HEK293 cells, and we examined their cellular localization by using confocal microscopy. However, to ensure that these effects are not a result of receptor and/or RGS overexpression, we performed radioligand binding experiments using 125I-BE2254 on cells transiently expressing HA-α1A-AR and HA-α1B-ARs, and we found that both constructs express between 100 and 300 fmol/mg protein (data not shown), which is well within the physiological range for expression of these receptors in native systems (27Esbenshade T.A. Wang X. Williams N.G. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that when titrating the concentration of GFP-tagged RGS constructs to be used in transfection from 0.5 to 6 μg of cDNA per 30-mm plate, 3 μg of construct resulted in ∼60% transfection efficiency with the majority of the cells exhibiting low to moderate fluorescence (data not shown).

However, upon co-transfection with HA-α1A-ARs, RGS2-GFP was primarily localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B, upper panels), whereas RGS2-GFP remained sequestered within the nucleus when co-transfected with HA-α1B-ARs (Fig. 2B, middle panels). In addition, RGS16-GFP cellular localization was unchanged upon co-expression with HA-α1A- (Fig. 2B, lower panels) or HA-α1B-ARs (data not shown), indicating this association occurs in an RGS-specific manner. Therefore, these experiments support our findings from the pull-down assays demonstrating that RGS2 can selectively associate with α1A-ARs. A previous report (10Roy A.A. Lemberg K.E. Chidiac P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) indicates that RGS proteins are recruited to the plasma membrane when co-expressed with GPCR in an agonist-independent manner. To examine the effects of receptor ligand binding on α1A-AR/RGS2 co-localization, HEK293 cells transiently co-expressing HA-α1A-ARs and RGS2-GFP were stimulated with norepinephrine, niguldipine, and prazosin, respectively. Addition of 100 nm of the α1A-AR subtype-selective antagonist niguldipine for 30 min did not alter the co-localization of α1A-AR/RGS2 at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C, upper panel). Incubating cells with the putative α1-AR inverse agonist prazosin (100 nm, 30 min) also did not alter the plasma membrane localization of α1A-AR/RGS, although the proteins appeared to be clustered and nonoverlapping in their distribution (Fig. 2C, middle panel). However, stimulation of cells with 10 μm NE for 30 min resulted in marked α1A-AR internalization with an apparent disruption of the α1A-AR-RGS2 complex (Fig. 2C, lower panel). This was also observed following 5 and 15 min of stimulation with 10 μm NE and with 5, 15, and 30 min of stimulation with 1 μm NE (data not shown). Therefore, these data suggest that agonist stimulation results in α1A-AR internalization, which is followed by subsequent RGS2 dissociation from the receptor and redistribution to the cytosol. RGS2 Selectively Inhibits α1A-AR Functional Responses in HEK293 Cells—We next examined if RGS2 can selectively regulate α1A-AR functional responses, by transiently transfecting α1-ARs into HEK293 alone and in combination with RGS2 proteins and assaying for NE-stimulated [3H]InsP formation. Both HA- and GFP-tagged RGS2 significantly inhibited [3H]InsP formation by α1A-ARs in response to 100 μm NE by 60.6 ± 3.3 and 61.4 ± 5.3%, respectively (Fig. 3, left). Transfection with pEGFP or pcDNA3.1 vector alone had no effect on α1A-AR signaling. However, HA- and GFP-tagged RGS2 had no significant effect on α1B-AR-stimulated [3H]InsP formation (Fig. 3, right). Combined with our previous findings, these data indicate that RGS2 selectively associates with α1A-ARs at the plasma membrane to facilitate uncoupling of the receptor with G-protein-mediated functional responses. Effect of RGS2/α1A-AR Association on Agonist Binding Affinity—It is generally accepted that agonists display multiple affinity states for GPCRs, as a result of G-protein binding to GPCR i3 loops. Typically, binding of the G-protein induces low affinity agonist binding interactions with the GPCR, and uncoupling of the G-protein by GTP decreases agonist affinity by >10-fold. In our studies, we find that RGS2 can directly associate with the α1A-i3. We therefore tested whether RGS2 affected agonist affinity for binding to the α1A-AR. To examine this, we harvested membranes from HEK293 cells stably expressing wild-type α1A-ARs, which were then preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with concentrations of purified RGS2-HA reported previously to be sufficient for maximal association with M1 receptors in isolated Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes (16Bernstein L.S.

After 30 min, the affinity of the nonselective adrenergic receptor agonist NE was determined using 125I-BE2254 competition radioligand binding. As reported in Table I, NE bound with low affinity to α1A-ARs when expressed alone. However, preincubation with 10, 30, or 100 nm RGS2 caused no significant change in affinity, suggesting that RGS2 binding to the α1A-AR does not affect ligand-receptor interactions.Table IEffect of RGS2/α1A-AR association on agonist affinityTreatmentLog KImWT α1A-AR−4.32+ 10 nm RGS2-HA−4.52+ 30 nm RGS2-HA−4.41+ 100 nm RGS2-HA−4.44 Open table in a new tab The N Terminus of RGS2 Determines Selectivity of Receptor Association—Previously, we and others have shown the N-terminal domains of RGS proteins are required for promoting association with the Gα subunits and with GPCRs (16Bernstein L.S.

Therefore, we examined the capacity of a chimera containing the N-terminal portion of RGS2 fused to the RGS domain and C-terminal portion of RGS16 (N2/RGS16-HA) to associate with and inhibit the signaling of α1A-ARs (Fig. 4A). In pull-down assays, we found RGS2-HA and N2/RGS16-HA selectively associated with α1A-i3 GST-fusion proteins, whereas RGS16-HA did not (Fig. 4A). In HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with HA-α1A-ARs alone or with RGS constructs, co-expression with RGS2-HA resulted in significant inhibition of α1A-AR stimulation of [3H]InsP formation, whereas co-expression with RGS16-HA caused no significant decrease in the α1A-AR maximal response (Fig. 4B). However, co-expression with N2/RGS16-HA caused a decrease in NE-stimulated [3H]InsP formation to the level observed with RGS2 (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data suggest that the N-terminal region of RGS2 is responsible for association with and inhibition of α1A-AR function, through a direct association with the i3 loop. Identification of Amino Acids within the α1A-i3 Responsible for Binding of RGS2—Thus far, we have determined that RGS2 associates with the α1A-AR through a direct association with the proximal half of the i3 loop. Next, we initiated studies to identify specific amino acids within the α1A-i3 that are responsible for promoting this interaction. In Fig. 1, we showed RGS2 binds the α1A/B but not the α1B/A-i3 chimera. By comparing the sequence homology between the α1A-i3 and α1B-i3 (Fig. 5A), nonhomologous amino acids in the proximal half were identified between the receptors to target for substitution mutation, and used to create a series of α1A-i3 mutants in w"
https://openalex.org/W2043959412,"Abstract Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein Nrf2 is a key transcription factor mediating the antioxidant response. Under homeostatic conditions Nrf2 is anchored to cysteine-rich Keap1 and sequestered in the cytoplasm. When challenged with oxidative stress, Keap1 functions as a redox-sensitive switch and releases Nrf2. Subsequently, Nrf2 translocates into the cell nucleus and binds to a cis-acting enhancer called the antioxidant response element located in the promoters of a battery of cytoprotective genes and initiates their transcription. In this study we identify a canonical nuclear export signal (NES) (537LKKQLSTLYL546) located in the leucine zipper (ZIP) domain of the Nrf2 protein. The enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged ZIP domain of Nrf2 (amino acids 503–589) exhibited a CRM1-dependent cytosolic distribution that could be abrogated by site-directed mutations or treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B. Ectotopic expression of the Nrf2-NES could also exclude the GAL4 DNA binding domain into the cytoplasm. This NES overlapped with the ZIP motif in Nrf2, suggesting that the formation of heterodimers between Nrf2 and other bZIP proteins may simultaneously mask the NES and attenuate Nrf2 nuclear export. The Nrf2-NES appeared to be redox-insensitive. Neither oxidants (sulforaphane and diethyl maleate) nor reducing compounds (N-acetyl-l-cysteine and reducing glutathione) could disrupt the cytosolic distribution of Nrf2zip. Because Nrf2 activation is generally redox-sensitive, the redox insensitivity of this Nrf2-NES indicates the importance of Keap1 retention as a key rate-limiting step in Nrf2 activation. The characterization of the Nrf2 NES may help decipher the mechanisms governing nuclear localization and subsequent transcriptional activation of Nrf2-mediated cytoprotective genes."

Malaria is one of the most intractable human afflictions in the world. Despite intensive campaigns against the parasitic disease, an estimated 300 to 500 million cases still occur each year. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria, is responsible for over 2 million deaths annually, largely among young children and pregnant women (1Sachs J. Malaney P.

Efforts to eradicate malaria have not been successful, and the situation may be worsening due, in large part, to the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites. The need for new antimalarial drugs is now widely recognized. Atovaquone represents a new class of drugs having a metabolic target different from extant antimalarial drugs to which resistance is widespread. Atovaquone was found to be a very effective antimalarial compound, but unsuitable for use as a single agent because of the relatively quick emergence of resistance (3Chiodini P.L. Conlon C.P.

However, in combination with the synergistic agent proguanil, it has been effective for both therapeutic and prophylactic uses (5Looareesuwan S. Chulay J.D. Canfield C.J. Hutchinson D.B. Am. J. Trop.

On the other hand, once atovaquone resistance has arisen, the combination is no longer effective against malaria parasites (8Fivelman Q.L. Adagu I.S. Warhurst D.C. Antimicrob.

Previous studies have shown that atovaquone selectively inhibits mitochondrial electron transport in the parasite, consistent with the prevalent theory that hydroxynaphthoquinones function as ubiquinone antagonists (10Fry M.

Additionally, atovaquone was found to collapse the parasite mitochondrial membrane potential at nanomolar concentrations (11Srivastava I.K. Rottenberg H. Vaidya A.B. J. Biol.

The potentially key region in cytochrome b associated with atovaquone resistance exhibits a particularly high degree of similarity between the malarial and bacterial complexes. In R. capsulatus, the cytochrome bc1 complex consists of only three subunits, which are amenable to site-directed mutagenesis, and its three-dimensional structure has recently been determined (19Berry E.A.

Using this bacterial system, it has been possible to demonstrate an unprecedented large amplitude domain movement involving the [2Fe-2S] protein that accompanies electron transfer from ubihydroquinone bound within cytochrome b to cytochrome c1 (24Darrouzet E.

In this work, we have constructed R. capsulatus cytochrome b substitution mutants predicted to have either enhanced or reduced sensitivity to atovaquone. Characterization of the altered cytochrome bc1 complexes through biochemical and biophysical approaches provides new insight into the molecular mode of action of atovaquone as a potent antimalarial drug. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth, in the presence of appropriate antibiotics, and R. capsulatus strains in mineral/peptone/yeast/extract-enriched medium (27Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or in RCVB medium (28Beatty J.T. Gest H. Arch. Microbiol. 1981; 129: 335-340Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar) containing 5 mm glutamate, in the presence of 10 μg/ml kanamycin. Respiratory or photosynthetic growth of R. capsulatus strains was at 30-35 °C in the dark under semiaerobic conditions or in anaerobiosis under continuous light, respectively. MT-RBC1 is a cytochrome bc-1 strain in which the chromosomal copy of the petABC operon (also called fbcFBC) has been deleted and replaced by a gene cartridge conferring resistance to spectinomycin (27Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The strain pMTS1/MT-RBC1 corresponds to MT-RBC1 complemented in trans with the plasmid pMTS1 (29Gray K.A. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which is a broad host-range plasmid that provides resistance to kanamycin and contains a wild-type copy of petABC. Molecular Genetic Techniques—Mutations were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in plasmid pPET1 (27Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mutagenic oligonucleotides used were (with the changes to the parental sequences denoted in bold italics): 5′-CGGCGGCAAAGGCCTTCAGCATCGCGTAGA-3′ (I304M+R306K), 5′-GTCGGCGGCAAAGGCCCGGAGGATCGCGCAGAACGGCAG-3′ (Y302C), and 5′-GTCGGCGGCAAAGGCTTTCAGCATCGCGCAGAACGGCAG-3′ (Y302C in Met304/Lys306 background). Each oligonucleotide introduces a silent change to a restriction enzyme recognition site (underlined), as well as the target mutation(s). Sequences of the auxiliary oligonucleotides used in mutagenesis and sequencing are available on request. The SmaI-BstBI fragment of the pPET1 derivative containing the mutation thus generated was then exchanged with its wild-type counterpart in pMTS1, and the newly constructed plasmids were introduced into MT-RBC1 via triparental crosses (27Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In all cases, the presence of the desired mutation and absence of any additional mutation on the insert thus exchanged was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The entire gene encoding cytochrome b was sequenced from a post-experiment sample of bacteria expressing the triple I304M/R306K/Y302C-substituted cytochrome bc1 complex. Biochemical and Biophysical Techniques—Intracytoplasmic membrane (chromatophore) preparation and protein determination were performed as described (27Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase assays were performed essentially as described (27Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Representative experimental results displayed in the figures in this article were obtained using samples prepared from semiaerobically grown cells. SDS-PAGE was performed by using an acrylamide concentration of 15% (w/v), and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Proteolysis experiments with thermolysin were done basically according to Valkova-Valchanova et al. (25Valkova-Valchanova M. Darrouzet E. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Daldal F.

Temperature control was maintained by an Oxford ESR-9 continuous flow helium cryostat interfaced with an Oxford model ITC4 temperature controller. The frequency was measured with a Hewlett-Packard model 5350B frequency counter. Unless otherwise noted, the operating parameters were as follows: sample temperature, 20 K; microwave frequency, 9.45 GHz; microwave power, 2 milliwatt; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 20.243 G; and time constant, 163.84 ms. Samples were poised with the ubiquinone pool oxidized and [2Fe-2S] cluster reduced by addition of 20 mm sodium ascorbate. Light-induced, single-turnover time-resolved kinetics were performed as described (24Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transient cytochrome c re-reduction kinetics initiated by a short saturating flash (8 μs) from a xenon lamp was followed at 550 nm - 540 nm. The concentrations of antimycin A, atovaquone, myxothiazol, and stigmatellin used were 5, 10, 5, and 1 μm, respectively, and the ambient potential was poised at 100 mV. Properties of R. capsulatus with Mutated Cytochrome b—Whereas a functional cytochrome bc1 complex is not required for aerobic growth of R. capsulatus because of the presence of an alternate respiratory pathway (32Zannoni D. Venturoli G. Daldal F. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 157: 367-374Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), this enzyme is essential for its anoxygenic photosynthetic growth. Thus, in bacteria with a mutated cytochrome bc1 complex, under appropriate conditions, photosynthetic growth rate reflects the functional efficiency of the cytochrome bc1 complex. Comparing the cytochrome b sequence of Plasmodium and R. capsulatus around a highly conserved portion of the Qo site (part of the ef loop, containing the conserved “PEWY” motif (Fig. 1)), which is believed to be involved in the binding of atovaquone (9Srivastava I.K. Morrisey J.M. Darrouzet E. Daldal F. Vaidya A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), we noticed remarkable identity between these organisms, within the segment from residue 292 to 306 (bacterial numbering) all the amino acids are identical except two, and these two represent conservative changes (Fig. 1). Because atovaquone binding affinity is likely influenced by subtle local changes, we mutated the two R. capsulatus residues (Ile304 and Arg306) to their respective Plasmodium counterparts (Met and Lys) to better mimic the structure of the malaria cytochrome bc1 complex in this region. We also mutated Tyr302 to cysteine (Cys302) in both the wild-type and the Met304/Lys306 backgrounds. This tyrosine corresponds to the site most frequently found altered in clinical cases of malaria atovaquone resistance (8Fivelman Q.L. Adagu I.S. Warhurst D.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4097-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Korsinczky M. Chen N. Kotecka B. Saul A. Rieckmann K. Cheng Q. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2100-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These R. capsulatus mutant strains were examined for their anaerobic photosynthetic growth rate as well as for the specific activity of their cytochrome bc1 complex in isolated chromatophore membranes. As shown in Table I, the photosynthetic growth rate was reduced by 13-25% of the wild-type rate in Met304/Lys306 and Cys302 strains, but was reduced by 50% in the strain bearing all three amino acid substitutions. We isolated chromatophore membranes from these strains to assess their cytochrome bc1 complex activity. The overall protein content, as well the b- and c-type cytochrome content of these membrane preparations were similar (Table I), indicating that all strains produced and assembled comparable amounts of cytochrome bc1 complexes under the conditions used. The cytochrome bc1 complex activity was reduced only modestly in the Met304/Lys306 strain, but by about 90% in strains bearing the atovaquone resistance-associated Cys302 substitution. These observations were consistent with the greater effect of the latter substitution on photosynthetic growth of R. capsulatus, although the degree of growth retardation was lower than its effect on enzymatic function, presumably because of the overexpression of the cytochrome bc1 complex in a trans-complemented “wild-type” strain.Table IRelevant properties of R. capsulatus cells and chromatophore membrane preparationsStrain (batches)aNumber of membrane preparations assayed (for measurements other than the PS growth rate).Description (plasmid)/host strainRelative PSbPS, photosynthetic. growth rateProtein content of membranecThe data presented are mean ± S.D.Cytochrome b content of membranecThe data presented are mean ± S.D.Cytochrome c+c1 content of membranecThe data presented are mean ± S.D.Relative cytochrome c reductase activity%mg/mlnmol/mg%Wild-type (5) (Tyr302/Ile304/Arg306)(pMTS1)/MT-RBC1100dGrowth rate of 100% = 0.225 h−1 exponential growth coefficient.23 ± 63.1 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.2100e100% relative activity = 5.81 ± 0.42 μmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/mg protein.Met304/Lys306 (4)(pMTS:I304M/R306K)/MT-RBC18719 ± 32.8 ± 0.41.6 ± 0.380Cys302 (3)(pMTS:Y302C)/MT-RBC17520 ± 32.8 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.211Met304/Lys306/Cys302 (5)(pMTS: I304M/R306K/Y302C)/MT-RBC14723 ± 32.9 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.39.1a Number of membrane preparations assayed (for measurements other than the PS growth rate).b PS, photosynthetic.c The data presented are mean ± S.D.d Growth rate of 100% = 0.225 h−1 exponential growth coefficient.e 100% relative activity = 5.81 ± 0.42 μmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/mg protein. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of the Cytochrome bc1 Complex by Atovaquone and Other Qo Site Inhibitors—We assessed inhibition profiles of atovaquone, stigmatellin, and myxothiazol on cytochrome bc1 complex activity in chromatophores membranes prepared from the R. capsulatus strains described above. Representative inhibition plots from the atovaquone titrations are shown in Fig. 2, and the average measured mid-point inhibition concentrations (IC50) for the three inhibitors for each strain are given in Table II. The wild-type cytochrome bc1 complex was inhibited by atovaquone with IC50 of about 30 nm. However, unlike stigmatellin or myxothiazol (33Daldal F. Tokito M.K. Davidson E. Faham M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3951-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), R. capsulatus growth is not inhibited by atovaquone when the drug is included in the medium, possibly because of lack of accessibility to its site of action in intact bacteria. Cytochrome bc1 complex from the strain bearing the Met304/Arg306 substitutions was inhibited by atovaquone with IC50 of about 10 nm. This 3-fold reduction in IC50 is consistent with our prediction that subtle changes observed in the Plasmodium cytochrome b are responsible for the enhanced therapeutic window for atovaquone. The substitution corresponding to one commonly seen in atovaquone-resistant human malaria parasites, Cys302, dramatically increased the IC50 of atovaquone in the cytochrome bc1 complex. This was observed in both the wild-type and Met304/Arg306 background strains. These results now formally confirm a causal relationship between the alteration of a conserved tyrosine residue within the ef loop and acquisition of atovaquone resistance in malaria parasites. It was interesting to note that the Cys302 substitution had much more modest effects on IC50 for two other Qo site inhibitors, stigmatellin and myxothiazol, increasing it by 2-20-fold compared with 100-200-fold for atovaquone (Table II). These results are consistent with the crystallographically defined binding niches of the former two inhibitors at the Qo site (34Esser L. Quinn B. Li Y.F. Zhang M. Elberry M. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 281-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and with the structural differences among the Qo site inhibitors, in particular, the inflexible cyclohexyl-chlorophenyl moiety of atovaquone, highlighting the divergence between the specific subsites occupied by these Qo site inhibitors.Table IIEffect of Qo site inhibitorsStrain (batches)aNumber of membrane preparations titrated.AtovaquoneStigmatellinMyxothiazolnmbThe data presented are mean ± S.D.Wild type (5)27.5 ± 7.85.7 ± 1.07.5 ± 0.9Met304/Lys306 (4)9.6 ± 3.66.4 ± 0.814 ± 1.4Cys302 (3)~2500cApproximate average value based on extrapolation of the early portions of the inhibition versuss concentration curves.

Open table in a new tab Effect of Inhibitors on the Ubihydroquinone Oxidation Site (Qo)-Iron-Sulfur Cluster ([2Fe-2S]) Interaction Probed by EPR Spectroscopy—The EPR spectrum of the [2Fe-2S] cluster is very sensitive to its molecular environment, and therefore, to local conditions surrounding it, including the conditions at the Qo site in cytochrome b (35Ding H. Robertson D.E. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3144-3158Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the native enzyme, this spectrum exhibits a relatively sharp gx transition at a g ∼ 1.80 value, which is indicative of the interactions of the reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster with ubiquinone in the Qo site (Fig. 3A) (36Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, to assess the effects of Y302C and I304M/R306K mutations on these interactions, the EPR spectra of appropriate wild-type and mutated enzyme complexes in chromatophores were examined in the absence and presence of inhibitors. The gx signal of the cytochrome bc1 complex carrying the Met304/Lys306 substitutions is slightly shifted to lower magnetic field and broader than that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3A), which could be because of subtle differences in the interactions of the [2Fe-2S] cluster with the Qo site in the mutant enzyme. In the presence of myxothiazol, stigmatellin, or atovaquone this gx signal shifts to higher magnetic field and broadens to vario"

The mature protein is comprised largely of contiguous Link and CUB modules, the former binding several matrix components such as hyaluronan (HA) and aggrecan. Here we show that this domain can also associate with the glycosaminoglycan heparin/heparan sulfate. Docking predictions and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrate that this occurs at a site distinct from the HA binding surface and is likely to involve extensive electrostatic contacts. Despite these glycosaminoglycans binding to non-overlapping sites on the Link module, the interaction of heparin can inhibit subsequent binding to HA, and it is possible that this occurs via an allosteric mechanism. We also show that heparin can modify another property of the Link module, i.e. its potentiation of the anti-plasmin activity of inter-α-inhibitor (IαI). Experiments using the purified components of IαI indicate that TSG-6 only binds to the bikunin chain and that this is at a site on the Link module that overlaps the HA binding surface. The association of heparin with the Link module significantly increases the anti-plasmin activity of the TSG-6·IαI complex. Changes in plasmin activity have been observed previously at sites of TSG-6 expression, and the results presented here suggest that TSG-6 is likely to contribute to matrix remodeling, at least in part, through down-regulation of the protease network, especially in locations containing heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

Indeed, in the context of proteoglycan-induced arthritis, tsg-6-/- mice show increased plasmin activity in inflamed paw joints compared with wild-type mice (40Szántó S. Bardos T. Gál I. Glant T.T. Mikecz K. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in mice with antigen-induced arthritis, constitutive expression of TSG-6 in cartilage resulted in a less severe disease phenotype with delayed onset of symptoms relative to controls (39Glant T.T. Kamath R.V. Bardos T. Gál I. Szántó S. Murad Y.M. Sandy J.D. Mort J.S. Roughley P.J. Mikecz K. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2207-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Heparin, a heavily-sulfated polysaccharide consisting of alternating residues of uronic acid (either α-l-iduronic acid or β-d-glucuronic acid) and α-d-glucosamine connected via 1→4-glycosidic linkages, is best known as a modulator of protease function through its interaction with serine protease inhibitors. IαI is also a heparin-binding protein (41Carrette O. Mizon C. Sautiere P. Sesboue R. Mizon J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1338: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and therefore it is possible that this GAG may have an effect on its anti-plasmin activity. We have reported previously that heparin is unable to compete for HA binding to the Link module of TSG-6 (13Parkar A.A. Day A.J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and hence we concluded that this domain does not interact with heparin. However, given that the CUB module in other proteins (e.g. the spermadhesins) binds to heparin (42Calvette J.J. Mann K. Sanz L. Raida M. Töpfer-Petersen E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 43Kraus M. Ticha M. Jonakova V. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2001; 2: 131-144Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it was thought possible that the TSG-6 CUB module could mediate such an interaction. Therefore, we have revisited the question of whether heparin/heparan sulfate binds to TSG-6 (comparing its interaction with the full-length protein and Link module) and investigated the effect of heparin on the ability of TSG-6 to potentiate the inhibitory activity of IαI toward plasmin. In this study we demonstrate, using microtiter plate assays and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), an interaction between TSG-6 and heparin/heparan sulfate via its Link module domain; the position of the heparin-binding site was predicted by computational docking and was then verified by site-directed mutagenesis. Importantly, the binding of heparin augments the potentiation by TSG-6 of the anti-plasmin activity of IαI. We propose that this inhibition of plasmin arises through the formation of a ternary complex in which heparin may enhance the interaction between the Link module of TSG-6 and the bikunin chain of IαI. We also describe a role for heparin in inhibiting subsequent interactions between TSG-6 and HA but have confirmed that heparin is not an effective inhibitor when both these GAGs are present. These results suggest that there may be partitioning of TSG-6 into different functional pools depending on the composition of GAGs in different tissue microenvironments. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Proteins—The Link module from human TSG-6 (Link_TSG6; residues 36-133 in the preprotein (44Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J.

The same methodology was used to make six additional single-site and six multiple-site Link_TSG6 mutants of residues predicted to be involved in heparin binding (i.e. K20A, K34A, K41A, K54A, R56A, R84A, K34A/K54A, K20A/K34A/K41A, K20A/K41A/K54A, K20A/K34A/K54A, K34A/K41A/K54A, and K20A/K34A/K41A/K54A; see “Results”). These new mutants were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and by one-dimensional NMR to determine if they were folded, as described previously (15Mahoney D.J. Blundell C.D.

Each protein had an experimental mass within 3.0 Da of the theoretical value and was stored lyophilized at -20 °C.

All microtiter plate assays were developed by adding 200 μl/well of 1 mg/ml disodium p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.3. The absorbance values at 405 nm were measured after 5 min and corrected against blank wells (i.e. those that contained no heparin). The heparin-binding activities of Link_TSG6 mutants were compared with that of the wild-type Link module using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described above except that the proteins were incubated on plates coated at a heparin concentration of 1 μg/well. Protein binding was detected using either Q75 or A38; rat monoclonal antibodies, which recognize different epitopes in the TSG-6 Link module (52Lesley J. English N.M. Gál I. Mikecz K. Day A.J.

Hp8 (ranging from 0.26 to 0.59 mm) was added, in injections 28 × 5 μl, into protein solution at 0.015-0.087 mm. Data were fitted to a one-site model by non-linear least squares regression with the Origin software package, after subtracting the heats resulting from the addition of oligomer into buffer alone, as described previously (14Kahmann J.D.

Molecular Modeling—The position of the heparin-binding site on the TSG-6 Link module was predicted using Autodock version 2.4 (56Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Huey R. Olsen A.J. J. Comp. Aid. Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), implemented as described previously (55Sachchidanand L.O. Staunton D. Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Yoshida K. Campbell I.D. J. Biol.

This program allows for flexibility in the ligand structure but uses a rigid-body protein approximation to speed up the calculation. Docking was performed with pentasaccharide (5-mer) or endecasaccharide (11-mer) models of heparin (consisting, respectively, of three or six GlcN2S6S residues separated by IdoA2S residues) and Link_TSG6 in either its free or HA-bound conformations (pdb accession codes 1o7b and 1o7c, respectively (16Blundell C.D.

To take account, at least in part, of variability in the IdoA ring geometry, two different 5-mer molecules were used in which all the IdoA2S residues adopted either the 1C4 or 2S0 ring form. The model ligands had fixed glycosidic torsion angles based on those reported for the structure of heparin in solution (58Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Jones C. Davies D.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar); for the pentasaccharide models, rotation around all other exocylic bonds was allowed. No bond rotation was allowed for the endecasaccharide model, in which IdoA2S residues took the 1C4 conformation. Partial atomic charges for the heparin monosaccharides were derived from ab initio quantum chemistry calculations using a HF/6-31G* basis set within the Jaguar program (Schrodinger Inc.). Automation of the docking calculation was achieved using Perl code to generate the Autodock input files, run the calculation, and analyze the output. The ten lowest energy coordinate sets were calculated for each of the Link module structures analyzed. HA Binding Assay—The effect of heparin on the interaction of HA with TSG-6 or Link_TSG6 was investigated using our standard assay, which measures the binding of biotinylated-HA (bHA) to protein-coated microtiter plates (see Refs. 15Mahoney D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2041693054,"We originally identified StarD10 as a protein overexpressed in breast cancer that cooperates with the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases in cellular transformation. StarD10 contains a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR/StarD1)-related lipid transfer (START) domain that is thought to mediate binding of lipids. We now provide evidence that StarD10 interacts with phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by electron spin resonance measurement. Interaction with these phospholipids was verified in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay with 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl-labeled lipids. Binding was not restricted to lipid analogs since StarD10 selectively extracted PC and PE from small unilamellar vesicles prepared with endogenous radiolabeled lipids from Vero monkey kidney cells. Mass spectrometry revealed that StarD10 preferentially selects lipid species containing a palmitoyl or stearoyl chain on the sn-1 and an unsaturated fatty acyl chain (18:1 or 18:2) on the sn-2 position. StarD10 was further shown to bind lipids in vivo by cross-linking of protein expressed in transfected HEK-293T cells with photoactivable phosphatidylcholine. In addition to a lipid binding function, StarD10 transferred PC and PE between membranes. Interestingly, these lipid binding and transfer specificities distinguish StarD10 from the related START domain proteins Pctp and CERT, suggesting a distinct biological function.

Selective transport of lipids and proteins between organelles is an essential process in the organization of membrane compartments in eukaryotic cells. This process is mainly mediated by budding of transport vesicles from a donor compartment followed by vector trafficking to and fusion with an acceptor compartment (1Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 2Pomorski T. Hrafnsdottir S. Devaux P.F. van Meer G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Lipids can also be delivered via monomeric exchange between the cytosolic membrane surfaces of different organelles. Monomeric exchange requires desorption of the lipid from the donor membrane, passage through the aqueous phase, and subsequent insertion into the acceptor membrane. Because spontaneous release from the membrane into the aqueous phase is a rare event for most membrane lipids, it has been suggested that specific proteins stimulate lipid exchange between cellular membranes (1Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G.

Although phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins have been studied extensively and their role in vesicular transport and signaling has been demonstrated, the cellular function of most START domain proteins still remains elusive.

The Pctp subfamily of START domain proteins further comprises Goodpasture antigen-binding protein, StarD7, and StarD10 (12Soccio R.E. Breslow J.L. J. Biol.

These cells demonstrate impaired sphingomyelin synthesis due to lack of CERT-mediated transfer of its precursor ceramide from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi membranes. StarD7 was reported to interact with phospholipid monolayers, indicating a function related to lipid binding (16Angeletti S. Maggio B. Genti-Raimondi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Apart from a function in intracellular lipid transfer, START domains are hypothesized to act as lipid sensors with a regulatory role in signal transduction and transcription. For example, the START domain proteins DLC1/2 are candidate tumor suppressors with Rho-GAP activity that inhibit Rho-mediated assembly of actin stress fibers (17Sekimata M. Kabuyama Y. Emori Y. Homma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17757-17762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Ching Y.P. Wong C.M. Chan S.F. Leung T.H. Ng D.C. Jin D.Y. Ng I.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10824-10830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In plants, many homeodomain transcription factors contain START domains, whereby lipid/sterol binding is hypothesized to induce conformational changes to control transcriptional activity (19Schrick K. Nguyen D. Karlowski W.M. Mayer K.F. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We identified the START domain protein, StarD10, to be overexpressed in Neu/ErbB2-induced mammary tumors in transgenic mice, in several human breast carcinoma cell lines, and in 35% of primary human breast cancers (20Olayioye M.A. Hoffmann P. Pomorski T. Armes J. Simpson R.J. Kemp B.E. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3538-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although StarD10 expression alone was not sufficient to transform cells, it potentiated cellular transformation when coexpressed with ErbB1/epidermal growth factor receptor by a yet unknown mechanism. Using intrinsic fluorescence measurements, we showed that StarD10 was capable of interacting with membranes (20Olayioye M.A. Hoffmann P. Pomorski T. Armes J. Simpson R.J. Kemp B.E. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3538-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the identity of lipid ligands was not explored. Here we characterize the lipid binding properties of StarD10 both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate a dual specificity lipid transfer function for phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Materials—Spin-labeled (SL) phospholipids 1-palmitoyl-2-(4-doxyl-pentanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SL-PC), SL-PE, and -phosphatidylserine were prepared as described previously (21Fellmann P. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 161-175PubMed Google Scholar). Porcine brain lipids (total extract) and the fluorescent lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-(12-[(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino-dodecanoyl]-phosphocholine (C12-NBD-PC), -phosphoethanolamine (C12-NBD-PE), -phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (C12-NBD-PG), and N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL); pyrene-labeled phospholipids 1-hexadecanoyl-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (pyrene-PC) and -phosphoethanolamine (pyrene-PE) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Pyrene-glycosylceramide and pyrene-sphingomyelin were synthesized and purified according to the protocol of Kishimoto (22Kishimoto Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1975; 15: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using pyrene-decanoic acid; 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-PE (TNP-PE), kindly provided by P. Somerharju, was prepared as described (23Gordesky S.E. Marinetti G.V. Segel G.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1973; 14: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The MALDI matrix (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid), trifluoroacetic acid, and all solvents (chloroform and methanol) were obtained from Fluka (Seelze, Germany). All other chemicals, including lipids, were purchased from Sigma. Protein Expression and Purification—Human StarD10 and Pctp cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into BL21 bacteria to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Expression was induced with 0.5 m isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 μg/ml lysozyme, Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% before two freeze-thaw cycles and sonication. In the case of protein preparations for mass spectrometry, Triton X-100 was omitted. GST-StarD10 and GST-Pctp were purified from clarified lysate with glutathione resin. GST-StarD10 was cleaved with PreScission protease according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Because PreScission cleavage of Pctp was inefficient, GST-Pctp was eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8. The purity of protein preparations was verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Lipid Binding Assays—Two assays were employed to characterize protein-lipid interactions. First, spin-labeled lipids dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) were dried under nitrogen and resuspended at a concentration of 180 μm in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra in the absence and presence of StarD10 (molar ratio of lipid to protein, L/P = 3:1) were recorded at 25 °C using an ECS 106 spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) with the following parameters: modulation amplitude, 4 G; power, 20 milliwatt; scan width, 100 G; accumulation, 9 times. Extraction of the immobilized component from ESR spectra was performed as described previously (24Muller P. Greube A. Topfer-Petersen E. Herrmann A. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, lipid binding was monitored using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) (400 nmol total lipid/ml) composed of porcine brain lipids/C12-NBD-lipid/N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (97.5:1:1.5 mol %) were prepared by sonication in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA using a Branson Sonifer 250 (Danbury, CT; 10 min; duty cycle, 20%; output control, 2). The vesicle suspension (6 nmol lipid/ml) was incubated at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensity was recorded at 535 nm (excitation, 479 nm; slit widths, 4 nm) in an Aminco Bowman Series 2 spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments, Rochester NY) before and after the addition of 23 μg of StarD10 (L/P = 20). Maximal dequenching (Fmax) was obtained by adding 0.5% Triton X-100. The percentage of fluorescence dequenching (FDQ) was calculated as FDQ = (F+ - F-)/(Fmax - F-) × 100, where F- and F+ are the fluorescence intensities before and after the addition of the protein. Lipid Transfer Assay—Protein-mediated transfer of lipids between SUVs was measured essentially as described (25van Paridon P.A. Gadella Jr., T.W. Somerharju P.J. Wirtz K.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6208-6214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The transfer assay mixture contained donor vesicles (2 nmol lipid/ml) composed of porcine brain lipids/pyrene-lipid/TNP-PE (89.5:0.5:10 mol %) and a 20-fold excess of acceptor vesicles composed of porcine brain lipids. Fluorescence intensity was recorded at 395 nm (excitation, 340 nm; slit widths, 4 nm) before and after the addition of 7.5 μg of StarD10 or Pctp at 37 °C. Fluorescence intensities were normalized to the maximum intensity obtained after the addition of Triton X-100 (0.5% final concentration). Binding of Endogenous Lipids—Vero cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were radiolabeled with [14C]acetic acid (37 kBq/ml; 17 nm; Amersham Biosciences) for 48 h. After washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, total cellular lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar), and SUVs were prepared by sonication in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA. SUVs were determined to contain 55% PC, 10% PE, 11% neutral lipids/cholesterol, 5% glycolipids, 3% PG/phosphatidic acid, and 3% sphingomyelin by measuring the amount of phospholipid phosphorus (27Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2865) Google Scholar). The vesicle suspension was incubated with purified StarD10 (230 μg/300 nmol of total phospholipid) or Pctp (115 μg/150 nmol of total phospholipid) for 60 min at 25 °C. For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, vesicles composed of porcine brain were prepared and incubated with purified StarD10 (1150 μg/1.5 μmol of total phospholipid) for 60 min at 25 °C. The protein was separated from the lipid vesicles by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30 min using a Centricon 100-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Lipid vesicles were recovered for analysis by centrifugation of the inverted filter at 1,000 × g for 2 min. Control experiments without protein showed that the vesicles were completely retained by the filter since no phospholipid was detected in the filtrate. Lipids were extracted from the filtrate (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar) and separated by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) using chloroform, methanol, water (65:25:4, v/v) or subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The TLC plates were dipped in 0.4% 2,5-diphenyloxazol dissolved in 2-methylnaphthalene supplemented with 10% xylene (28Bonner W.M. Stedman J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 89: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and exposed to Hyperfilms MP (Amersham Biosciences) films at -80 °C. The individual lipids were identified by comparing with commercial standards (Sigma). The ratio of PC and PE bound to StarD10 was determined by scraping off spots and scintillation counting. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—A 0.5 m 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid solution in methanol containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as matrix (29Schiller J. Suss R. Arnhold J. Fuchs B. Lessig J. Muller M. Petkovic M. Spalteholz H. Zschornig O. Arnold K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 449-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30Schiller J. Arnhold J. Benard S. Muller M. Reichl S. Arnold K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were evaporated to dryness and then re-dissolved in the same volume of matrix solution. For analysis of PC and PE species, brain lipid extracts were subjected to TLC before MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Samples were spotted onto HP-TLC silica gel 60 plates (Merck) and separated using chloroform/ethanol/water/triethylamine (30:35:7:35, v/v). The plates were sprayed with PRIMULINE (Direct Yellow 59) to visualize phospholipids. PE and PC were identified by their typical RF values of 0.47 and 0.15, respectively (31Schiller J. Süβ R. Fuchs B. Müller M. Zschörnig O. Arnold K. Chromatographia. 2003; 57: 297-302Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These spots were scraped off, and phospholipids were eluted by intense vortexing with a mixture of 75 μl of chloroform, 75 μl of methanol, and 75 μl of 0.9% aqueous NaCl. After phase separation, the organic layer was evaporated to dryness, and lipids were redissolved in 20 μl of matrix solution (see above). 1-μl droplets were applied to the MALDI target and allowed to crystallize. Drying of samples with a moderate warm stream of air improved the homogeneity of crystallization. All MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager Bio-spectrometry DE work station (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The system utilizes a pulsed nitrogen laser, emitting at 337 nm. The extraction voltage was 20 kV, and the “low mass gate” was turned on to prevent the saturation of the detector by ions resulting from the matrix. For each mass spectrum, 128 single laser shots were averaged. The laser strength was kept about 10% above threshold to obtain the best signal-to-noise ratio. To enhance the spectral resolution, all spectra were measured in the reflector mode. In Vivo Lipid Binding—Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The cells were transiently transfected with pEF1α expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged StarD10 or FLAG-tagged Pctp using Lipofectin reagent following the manufacturers' instructions (Invitrogen). 24 h post-transfection cells were labeled with 200 μCi of [3H]choline and 10-azi-stearic acid for 16 h in delipidated medium (32Thiele C. Hannah M.J. Fahrenholz F. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and irradiated for 2 min with UV light at 4 °C. Cells were scraped into hypotonic 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors and sheared using a 25-gauge needle, and lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating lysates after the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 120 mm with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Immune complexes were captured using protein G-Sepharose and washed 4 times with buffer containing 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, pH 7.2. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Before drying and autoradiography, the gel was incubated in 1 m sodium salicylate and 1% glycerol. An aliquot of the immunoprecipitates was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for analysis by Western blotting. Membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 before incubation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) in the same buffer. For detection of secondary antibodies, the ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used, and fluorescence was scanned on a FLA-3000 Fuji Imaging System (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) equipped with a 488-nm laser and a 515-nm long pass emission filter. Image analysis was performed using Aida Image Analyser 3.24 software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). StarD10 Binds Phospholipids—To identify potential phospholipid binding partners of StarD10, we employed ESR measurement of spin-labeled lipid analogs bearing a long fatty acid chain on the sn-1 position and a short fatty acid chain (pentanoic acid, C5) with a doxyl moiety on the sn-2 position. In aqueous solution at concentrations above their critical micellar concentration, the ESR spectra of spin-labeled lipid analogs are composed of two components, which reflect the equilibrium between micelles and lipid monomers in aqueous solution; they are (i) a broad component caused by strong spin-spin interaction of the analogs within the micelles and (ii) an isotropic signal with three defined peaks arising from freely tumbling analog monomers in the bulk solution (33Marsh D. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 31: 51-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Due to the homology of StarD10 with Pctp, we first analyzed potential binding of SL-PC to the protein. ESR spectra of SL-PC were recorded in the absence and presence of recombinant human StarD10 protein purified from Escherichia coli (Fig. 1A, top panels). The addition of StarD10 to SL-PC (lipid to protein ratio, L/P = 3) gave rise to a new component in the ESR spectra that was extracted by spectral subtraction (Fig. 1A, i.c. StarD10, see arrows). This component can be explained by lipid binding of StarD10. The large outer hyperfine splitting of this component (distance between the arrows) reflects a high immobilization of bound SL-PC, implicating a tight association of the analog with the protein (33Marsh D. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 31: 51-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In agreement with the binding of SL-PC to StarD10, micelle formation was strongly reduced, as deduced from the disappearance of the broad component. By ESR measurement, StarD10 was also found to interact with SL-PE in a similar manner as with SL-PC (Fig. 1B, top and middle panels), whereas interaction with SL-phosphatidylserine was less evident (data not shown). We further investigated the interaction of Pctp with these lipid analogs. Similar to StarD10, Pctp was found to interact with SL-PC (Fig. 1A, bottom panels, see arrows). Notably, we also found binding of SL-PE to Pctp (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), confirming previous observations that Pctp binds PE in the absence of PC (14de Brouwer A.P. Bouma B. van Tiel C.M. Heerma W. Brouwers J.F. Bevers L.E. Westerman J. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2001; 112: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the outer hyperfine splitting and, thus, the immobilization of protein-bound lipid analogs were much lower in comparison to that of StarD10. This suggests a comparatively loose association of lipids with Pctp. GST was used as a control protein and had no influence on the ESR spectrum of SL-PC (Fig. 1C). Because ESR utilizes lipids in solution, we next employed an assay based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer to analyze the interaction of StarD10 with PC and PE in membranes. Here, lipid analogs labeled with an NBD fluorescent energy donor at their fatty acid tail were incorporated into SUVs in the presence of head group-labeled rhodamine-PE, which functioned as the energy acceptor. Due to the close proximity of the fluorescent donor/acceptor pair, energy transfer to rhodamine resulted in significant quenching when NBD fluorescence was excited. Upon the addition of StarD10 to these vesicles (L/P = 20), a rapid increase in the NBD fluorescence was observed, which was most likely due to protein-mediated extraction of NBD-labeled lipids from vesicles, allowing fluorescence emission to occur. NBD fluorescence intensity was highest in the case of NBD-PC and was lower for NBD-PE, whereas only a small increase in NBD fluorescence was observed for NBD-PG. In comparison, Pctp displayed the reported specificity for PC in membranes containing other phospholipid species. For both proteins, quantification of lipid binding relative to that of PC is shown in Fig. 2. START domain proteins such as StAR and MLN64 have been shown to bind cholesterol. Using dehydroergosterol, a natural cholesterol analog with intrinsic fluorescence, and TNP-PE as a fluorescence quencher, we did not observe binding of StarD10 to sterols (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that StarD10 is capable of interacting with phospholipids in solution and in membranes, with a preference for PC and PE. StarD10 Binds Endogenous PC and PE—To test whether StarD10 interacted with endogenous lipids, we prepared SUVs with lipids extracted from [14C]acetic acid-labeled Vero monkey kidney cells. Recombinant StarD10 was incubated with these vesicles, and after separation of the protein from the lipid vesicles by membrane filtration through a 100-kDa cut-off filter, lipids bound to StarD10 were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography. This approach revealed extraction of both PC and PE by StarD10 (Fig. 3A). Recombinant Pctp, which was previously shown to bind PC in a similar assay, was loaded as a control (14de Brouwer A.P. Bouma B. van Tiel C.M. Heerma W. Brouwers J.F. Bevers L.E. Westerman J. Roelofsen B. Wirtz K.W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2001; 112: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Scintillation counting of lipids bound by StarD10 revealed a 10:1 ratio of PC and PE (Fig. 3A). Because vesicles contained 55% PC and 10% PE (see “Experimental Procedures”), the affinity of StarD10 for PC is ∼2-fold higher than for PE, which is in accordance with the binding preferences observed using NBD lipids. To obtain additional information on the fatty acid chain composition of phospholipids preferentially extracted by StarD10, we analyzed organic extracts of recombinant StarD10 protein before and after incubation with brain lipid vesicles by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Separation of StarD10 from the vesicles was performed by membrane filtration as described above. Selected positive ion MALDI-TOF spectra are shown in Fig. 3B. It is evident that the organic extract of the control filtrate did not contain any lipids (Fig. 3B, trace a). The only detectable peak at m/z = 727 corresponded to a typical matrix oligomerization product, whose chemical origin was described previously (34Petkovic M. Schiller J. Muller M. Benard S. Reichl S. Arnold K. Arnhold J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 289: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This peak was present in all spectra and is marked with an asterisk. Recombinant StarD10 analyzed directly after purification from bacteria was identified to contain mainly PE and PG (Fig. 3B, trace b). This is in accordance with the lipid composition of bacterial membranes, which lack PC but contain ∼80% PE and 15% PG. When StarD10 was incubated with porcine brain lipid vesicles before lipid extraction, PG was completely exchanged, and StarD10 was found t"

Virtually all eukaryotic cellular mRNAs contain a 5′-cap structure (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)N) that, during translation, serves as the binding site for the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; TEV, tobacco etch virus; nt, nucleotide; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; PK, pseudoknot; EMCV, encephalomyocarditis virus; SL, stem-loops. 4E, a subunit of eIF4F that also contains eIF4G and eIF4A (1Gallie D.R.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). eIF4F promotes binding of 40 S ribosomal subunits through the interaction of eIF4G and eIF3, the latter of which is associated with the 40 S ribosomal subunit. The interaction between eIF4G and eIF3 directs 40 S subunit binding at or close to the 5′ terminus. Following binding, the 40 S subunit scans down the RNA in search of the first AUG codon in a good context at which translation will initiate. The rate of 40 S subunit binding and initiation can be slowed or prevented altogether by the presence of a highly stable secondary structure (3Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2850-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 4Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Cell. 1985; 40: 515-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Because binding of eIF4E is critical for the subsequent binding of the 40 S subunit and assembly of a competent initiation complex, those mRNAs that naturally lack a 5′-cap must have evolved alternative mechanisms to promote translation. The only known mRNAs that naturally lack a cap are viral in origin. Poliovirus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and foot-and-mouth disease virus are examples of animal picornaviruses whose polyadenylated genomic mRNA lacks a 5′-cap structure and instead contains a VPg, i.e. a viral protein genome linked to the 5′ terminus that is removed prior to RNA recruitment into polysomes (5Dougherty W.G.

The 5′-leader of picornaviruses is long (610 to >1200 nucleotides), highly structured, and contains multiple AUGs upstream of the initiation codon of the polyprotein coding region (10Belsham G.J.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.2000: 869-900Google Scholar), features that should inhibit normal 40 S ribosomal scanning. Despite these apparent barriers to translation, picornaviral mRNAs are efficiently translated as a consequence of its 5′-leader, which contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to which the 40 S ribosomal subunit is recruited (11Jang S.K.

For EMCV, the IRES recruits eIF4G which in turn promotes internal binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit through its interaction with the 40 S subunit-bound eIF3 (14Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U.

In addition to canonical initiation factors, several cellular RNA-binding proteins that stimulate viral IRES activity have been identified. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, poly(rC)-binding protein-2, and unr have been shown to stimulate IRES activity for some but not all IRESs perhaps by acting as RNA chaperones that maintain IRES structure required for 40 S subunit binding (10Belsham G.J.

Its genomic organization is highly similar to picornaviruses in that the genomic RNA functions as a monocistronic mRNA encoding a single polyprotein that, once produced, is processed by viral-encoded proteases into capsid and noncapsid proteins required for the viral life cycle (18Allison R.F. Johnston R.E. Dougherty W.G. Virology. 1986; 154: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Allison R.F. Sorenson J.C. Kelly M.E. Armstrong F.B. Dougherty W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3969-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The genomic RNA of TEV is polyadenylated and naturally lacks a 5′-cap but is nevertheless efficiently translated. The 143-nt TEV 5′-leader is sufficient to confer cap-independent translation even in the absence of the 5′-terminal VPg (20Carrington J.C. Freed D.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. Leathers V. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two regions within the 143-nt TEV 5′-leader were identified previously as necessary to direct cap-independent translation, and their combinatorial effect was approximately multiplicative, suggesting that the two elements are two functional parts of a single regulatory region (22Niepel M. Gallie D.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9080-9088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TEV 5′-leader functionally interacts with the poly(A) tail to promote optimal cap-independent translation and requires eIF4G and poly(A)-binding protein (22Niepel M. Gallie D.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9080-9088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gallie D.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12141-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although the TEV 5′-leader evolved to function in a 5′-proximal position in a monocistronic mRNA, it also promoted translation of a second cistron in a dicistronic mRNA when the TEV leader sequence was introduced into the intercistronic region, indicating that the TEV 5′-leader contains an IRES (22Niepel M. Gallie D.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9080-9088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although IRES elements from picornaviral RNAs are typically large and highly structured, the TEV element is notable for its small size, representing one of the most compact viral elements identified that can promote cap-independent translation. The precise sequences in the TEV 5′-leader required to promote cap-independent translation have not been identified. Moreover, the structure of the TEV 5′-leader and its relationship with the function of the 5′-leader in promoting cap-independent translation is unknown. In this study, we show that a 5′-proximal, 45-nt RNA pseudoknot-containing domain within the TEV 5′-leader is required to promote cap-independent translation. Mutations that disrupted the pseudoknot reduced cap-independent translation, including mutations to loop 3 that exhibits complementarity to a conserved region in eukaryotic 18 S rRNAs. Changes to the loop that maintained its potential for base pairing with 18 S rRNA had only a small effect, supporting the possibility that base pairing between the pseudoknot and the 18 S rRNA may be involved in promoting cap-independent translation. Secondary Structure Analysis—The TEV 5′-leader sequence used in the experiments represents the 5′-proximal 143-nt of the TEV genome. The predicted secondary structure for the TEV 5′-leader was calculated through minimization of free energy using the Fold program of the GCG package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., version 7, University of Wisconsin (24Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Zuker M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7706-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar)). Prediction of ternary RNA structure employed the paRNAss and pknotsRG programs (25Sczyrba A. Kruger J. Mersch H. Kurtz S. Giegerich R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3767-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and RNA structures were visualized using PSEUDOVIEWER (26Han K. Byun Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3432-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The experimental data were used to correct the predicted models. RNA fragments were transcribed in vitro from pT7 constructs containing the appropriate TEV sequence. RNAs were 5′-end-labeled with [32P]ATP, resuspended into probing buffer, and heated rapidly. RNA folding was promoted by slow renaturation under native conditions (i.e. in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2) in order to refold the molecule into its native conformation and stabilize higher ordered structures. The labeled RNA was subjected to partial digestion with enzymatic probes in the appropriate buffer, and the RNA fragments were resolved on a denaturing TBE (Tris/Borate/EDTA)/urea 10% polyacrylamide gel. A ladder generated by alkaline hydrolysis of RNA was run on the same gel to help identify the cleavage site locations. mRNA Constructs and in Vitro RNA Synthesis—TEV-luc-A50 and Con144-luc-A50 luciferase constructs that contain the 143-nt TEV leader sequence or a 144-nt control sequence and that terminate in a poly(A)50 tract have been described previously (22Niepel M. Gallie D.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9080-9088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control construct was designed to be 60% AT-rich and nearly the same length as the TEV 5′-leader. The free energy calculated by the FOLD algorithm for the control sequence leader is ΔG =–11.5 kcal/mol, which is approximately equal to the free energy of ΔG = –10.7 kcal/mol of the 5′-leader of the TEV-luc-A50 mRNA construct (27Zuker M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Following linearization downstream of the poly(A)50 tract, the DNA concentration was quantitated spectrophotometrically and brought to 0.5 mg/ml. Uncapped mRNAs were synthesized in vitro as described previously (28Ysraeli J.K. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) by using 10 μg of template DNA in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 units/μl RNasin (Promega), and 0.5 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase. mRNA Delivery to Plant Protoplasts—Protoplasts were isolated from carrot suspension cells used previously in the analysis of the translational regulatory function of viral leaders (21Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. Leathers V. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Gallie D.R. Walbot V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4631-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) by digesting with 0.25% CELF cellulase, 1% cytolase, 0.05% pectolyase Y23, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol in protoplast isolation buffer (12 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 50 mm CaCl2, 0.25 m mannitol) for 90–120 min. Protoplasts were washed with protoplast isolation buffer followed by electroporation buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 130 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 0.2 m mannitol) and resuspended in electroporation buffer to ∼106 cells/ml. Equal amounts of mRNAs (∼2.5 μg) were added to 400 μl of cell suspension immediately before electroporation (250 microfarads, 300 V, 0.2-mm electrode) using an IBI GeneZapper. The electroporated cells were incubated in protoplast growth media (MS salts, pH 5.8, 30 g/liter sucrose, 100 mg/liter myoinositol, 0.1 mg/liter 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 1.3 mg/liter niacin, 0.25 mg/liter thiamine, 0.25 mg/liter pyridoxine, 0.25 mg/liter calcium penthotenate) supplemented with 20% of cultured medium (protoplast growth medium conditioned with carrot cells for 3 days) overnight prior to assaying for reporter gene activity. For each experiment, an mRNA was delivered to triplicate samples of protoplasts, and the average value of a typical experiment was reported. Identification of Sequences within the TEV 5′-Leader Required for Cap-independent Translation—Two regions of the TEV 5′-leader (i.e. nt 28–65 and nt 66–118) that functioned together to promote cap-independent translation were identified previously, suggesting that the region from nucleotides 28 to 118 was required (22Niepel M. Gallie D.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9080-9088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify more precisely the functional regions within the TEV 5′-leader involved in promoting cap-independent translation, a more detailed deletion analysis was performed. The full-length TEV 5′-leader and deletion derivatives were introduced upstream of the luc coding region in a T7 promoter-based construct that enabled in vitro synthesis of uncapped mRNA terminating in a poly(A)50 tail. The full-length TEV 5′-leader (i.e. TEV-(1–143)) promoted cap-independent translation 285-fold relative to the uncapped control luc mRNA containing a 5′-untranslated region of similar length and degree of secondary structure (i.e. Con144) (Fig. 1), in good agreement with previous results (21Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. Leathers V. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Niepel M. Gallie D.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9080-9088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated TEV-(1–118) and TEV-(1–97) constructs retained 90% of the translational activity of the full-length leader, whereas TEV-(1–85) enhanced translation 114-fold (40% of the activity of the full-length leader). Further truncation to TEV-(1–65) reduced the translational activity to 9% of the full-length leader. The activity associated with TEV-(1–65) was reduced more than 4-fold relative to TEV-(1–85), demonstrating the importance of the region between nt 65 and 85. Deletion of the 5′-proximal 65 nt (i.e. TEV-(66–143)) reduced the translational activity to 10% of the full-length leader, whereas deletion of the 5′-proximal 28 nt (i.e. TEV-(28–143)) retained 90% of the translational activity of the full-length leader, demonstrating the importance of the region between nt 29 and 65. Because this analysis suggested the region between nt 29 and 85 was critical to promoting cap-independent translation, a series of deletions within this region was made. Deletion of nt 38–43 resulted in just 20% of the activity of the full-length TEV leader, whereas deletion of nt 47–51 reduced cap-independent translation to 49% of the activity of the full-length TEV leader. Deletion of nt 54–60 substantially reduced cap-independent translation to just 9% of the full-length TEV leader construct, a level of reduction similar to deleting the 5′-proximal 65 nt (i.e. TEV-(66–143)), whereas deletion of nt 61–67 reduced cap-independent translation to 26%. Deletion of nt 67–75 reduced cap-independent translation to 40% of the full-length TEV leader. Deletion of the entire TEV 5′-leader was shown to reduce the translational efficiency of uncapped and polyadenylated luc mRNA in carrot protoplasts but did not affect its physical or functional stability (Gallie et al. (21Gallie D.R. Tanguay R. Leathers V. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). Thus, these results suggest that sequences from nt 28 to 75 are most important in promoting cap-independent translation. These results also demonstrate that cap-independent translation by the TEV 5′-leader is not conferred by a single discrete sequence but rather by several regions throughout the leader, raising the possibility that a higher order structure may be required for translation. Structural Analysis of the TEV RNA 5′-Leader—In order to further understand how multiple discrete regions in the TEV 5′-leader function together to promote cap-independent translation, the structure of the viral leader was determined. Prediction of the thermodynamically most stable secondary structure of the TEV 5′-leader suggested the presence of several stem-loops (SL) between nucleotides 38 and 136 preceded by a 5′-proximal 37-nt unstructured region (data not shown). Prediction of ternary structure within the TEV 5′-leader suggested tertiary interactions between the loop of the stem-loops and sequence adjacent to each stem that would form three RNA PKs (Fig. 2A). PK1 is an H-type pseudoknot with two stems, S1 (6 bp) and S2 (5 bp), that are connected by loops L1 (3 nt), L2 (2 nt), and L3 (7 nt) (Fig. 2A). S1 contains a 1-base bulge (C56) on the 3′-distal side of the stem. S1 and S2 are separated by the two nucleotides of L2, i.e. C52 and A53, which, to allow coaxial-stacking, would need to bulge out of the helix but if not would produce a bend in the pseudoknot, thus preventing coaxial stacking (30Chen X. Kang H. Shen L.X. Chamorro M. Varmus H.E. Tinoco Jr., I. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Kang H. Tinoco Jr., I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1943-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Shen L.X. Tinoco Jr., I. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 963-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PK1 is flanked by a 5′-proximal 37-nt sequence that is predicted to possess little secondary structure. PK2 is an H-type pseudoknot composed of S1 (6 bp) and S2 (3 bp) that are connected by loops L1 (3 nt), L2 (2 nt), and L3 (4 nt) (Fig. 2A) and is similar to PK1 in that S1 and S2 are separated by two nucleotides in L2, i.e. C90 and U91. An alternative structure to PK2 is composed of two stem-loops (Fig. 2B). PK3 is also an H-type pseudoknot composed of S1 (5 bp) and S2 (3 bp) that are connected by loops L1 (2 nt) and L2 (1 nt). In this pseudoknot, S1 and S2 are not separated and thus may coaxially stack. To determine whether these predicted structures are supported experimentally, the structure of the TEV 5′-leader was examined in solution. The 5′-end-labeled, in vitro-synthesized, 143-nt TEV 5′-leader RNA was heat-denatured and renatured in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 to promote folding of the structure. Double-stranded regions were identified following partial digestion with RNase V1, which preferentially cleaves between nucleotides of double-stranded regions RNA or stacked single-stranded regions, generating 5′-phosphate fragments (33Favorova O.O. Fasiolo F. Keith G. Vassilenko S.K. Ebel J.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Single-stranded regions were identified following partial digestion with RNase T1, which cleaves 3′ of unpaired G residues as follows: RNase T2, a nonspecific 3′-cleaving endoribonuclease with a preference for A residues; RNase A, which cleaves 3′ of unpaired C and U residues; or nuclease S1, which cleaves 5′ of nucleotides nonspecifically (34Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 35Blackburn P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12484-12487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TEV 5′-leader was also probed with kethoxal that modifies unpaired G residues (34Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the 5′-proximal 37 nucleotides by RNase A, RNase T2, and nuclease S1 (Figs. 3 and 4) indicated that this region is highly accessible and unstructured, an observation consistent with the predicted structure. Some residues between 7 and 13 nt were less accessible to cleavage by these enzymatic probes, suggesting possible involvement in structure.Fig. 4Summary of the enzymatic and chemical probing data of the TEV 5′-leader. The enzymatic and chemical probing data of the TEV 5′-leader from Fig. 3 are summarized. Bases that were highly or moderately accessible to the probes are indicated by large or small symbols, respectively. Unmarked bases represent those that were not accessible. Tertiary base pairing is indicated by the gray lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNase V1 cleavage occurred at G38, A39, C42, U58, and C60 (Figs. 3 and 4) supporting the formation of S1 in PK1. RNase T2 cleaved at the bulged C (i.e. C56), indicating that this C was indeed accessible. A57, which lies immediately 3′ to the bulged C, was cleaved to a limited extent by RNase T2, indicating some local breathing. G38, which is predicted to be part of the first base pair at the base of the SL1 stem, was accessible as indicated by probing with RNase T1, but G38 and C60 were also cleaved by RNase V1. The accessibility of G38 may be explained by breathing at this end of SL1 where it is cleaved by RNase V1 when it is base-paired with C60 but cleaved by RNase T1 when it is not. G55 on left side of the S1 was largely resistant to RNase T1 cleavage (Figs. 3 and 4), consistent with its internal position in S1. G47 was largely resistant to cleavage by RNase T1 as were C48 and U51 to RNase A cleavage (Figs. 3 and 4) and C48, A49, A50, and U51 to cleavage by RNase T2 and nuclease S1. The low accessibility G47, C48, A49, A50, and U51 is inconsistent with their presence in a single-stranded loop, which would be expected to be accessible to single-stranded specific RNases and nucleases. The inaccessibility of this region is consistent with cleavage at C44, A45, C48, A49, A50, C52, and A53 by RNase V1 and suggests that the loop is structured or involved in base pairing. A sequence within this region (i.e. 47GCAAU51) is complementary to a region downstream of S1 (i.e. 68AUUGC72), raising the possibility of base pairing between these two regions to form a pseudoknot. Cleavage at A68, U69, and U70 by RNase V1 supports the putative base pairing between these regions and formation of S2 in PK1. The sequence representing L3 (61UACUUCU67) also exhibited little accessibility to single-stranded specific enzymatic probes (Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that L3 is sequestered in such a way that is not susceptible to cleavage. These data are consistent with the prediction of an H-type pseudoknot between nucleotides 38 and 72. The region separating PK1 from the downstream structures (i.e. nucleotides 73–77) showed limited accessibility to RNase A (C75), RNase T1 (G74), RNase T2 (A76 and A77), and nuclease S1 (G74), suggesting that this region is somewhat accessible, but limited cleavage by RNase V1 at A76 and A77 (Figs. 3 and 4) indicated that the region could be structured. The cleavage data supported the presence of either a pseudoknot or two stem-loops in the region from nt 78 to 104. Strong cleavage by RNase A at C85 and RNase T2 at A86 was observed (Figs. 3D and 4), suggesting that this region is highly accessible and may form loop L1 in PK2 or the loop in SL1 (Fig. 2B). Significant cleavage by RNase V1 was observed at U80 as it was at U91–U93, supporting the presence of S1 in PK2 (Figs. 3D and 4). Cleavage by RNase T2 at A95 and A97 (Figs. 3D and 4) suggests that this region is unstructured, which supports the presence of the loop in SL2 (Fig. 2B). Strong cleavage by RNase T1 at G98 is consistent with this base being present in L3 of PK2 or in the loop of SL2. Cleavage by RNase V1 was observed at A101 and supports the presence of the stem in SL2. Therefore, these data support the formation of PK2 or SL1/SL2 which may be in equilibrium. Cleavage by RNase V1 was observed at A106, A107, U108, U109, U110, A117, and U120 (Figs. 3D and 4), supporting the existence of S1 in PK3. Cleavage by RNase A at U111 is consistent with this base being present in L1 of PK3. Within the loop, the sequence 113UGA115 is complementary with 122UCA124, suggesting tertiary base pairing and the formation of a pseudoknot. The lack of strong cleavage at G114 by RNase T1 supports the presence of S2 in PK3, although moderate cleavage by nuclease S1 at this same position as well as RNase A at C123 may indicate that the tertiary base pairing in PK3 may not be strong. Cleavage by RNase A at C126, U130, and U139; by RNase T2 at A127, U128, U129, U130, A131, A138, and A140; by RNase T1 at G133, G137, and G141; and by nuclease S1 at U130, A131, G133, C136, and G137 suggested that the region downstream of PK3 may be unstructured. Stable RNA folding is sensitive to the presence of cations that promote folding by reducing the electrostatic repulsion between RNA phosphates (36Draper D.E. RNA (N. Y.). 2004; 10: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Tertiary interactions, where the proximity of RNA phosphates is increased over that in duplex RNA, are particularly stabilized by Mg2+ as was first observed during tRNA folding (37Cole P.E. Yang S.K. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4358-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38Romer R. Hach R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 55: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 39Stein A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Stabilization by Mg2+ reduces enzymatic cleavage by single-stranded nucleases as a consequence of stable base pairing and thus can serve as an indicator of the presence of tertiary interactions. To examine whether the proposed tertiary structures within the TEV 5′-leader are stabilized by Mg2+, the RNA was probed with RNase T1 in the presence of decreasing amounts of Mg2+. An increase in accessibility at the paired G38, G47, and G55 in the stems of PK1 was observed following removal of Mg2+ and, although faint, at the paired G71 in S2 as well, whereas little difference in accessibility was observed at the unpaired G74 that lies just downstream of PK1 (Fig. 5). The accessibility of the unpaired G98 in the loop of SL1 (or L3 of PK2) actually decreased following removal of Mg2+ (Fig. 5). The high level of accessibility of G98 in the presence of Mg2+ may be a result of this nucleotide being highly exposed in the folded structure. An increase in accessibility at G104 in the stem of SL2 (or S2 of PK2) and G114 in S2 of PK3 was observed following removal of Mg2+ (Fig. 5). Larger molecular weight bands did not resolve well in the presence of Mg2+, making it difficult to assess changes in the accessibility of G133, G137, and G141. These data indicate that Mg2+ does affect the stability of higher order structures within the TEV leader and support the involvement of several guanosine residues in secondary and tertiary interactions. Because PK1 is present in the region between nt 28 and 75 identified in Fig. 1 as functionally critical in promoting cap-independent translation, the involvement of tertiary base pairing within PK1 was investigated further.

In this investigation, the molecular interactions between TAK1 and Smad proteins were characterized as well as their influence on BMP-mediated mesenchymal cell differentiation along the osteogenic/chondrogenic pathway. In co-immunoprecipitations we found an interaction of TAK1 with all Smads tested, R-Smads Smads1-5, the co-Smad Smad4, and the inhibitory Smads (I-Smad6 and I-Smad7). Smad interaction with TAK1 takes place through their MH2 domain. This interaction is dependent on the presence of an active kinase domain in TAK1. TAK1 dramatically interferes with R-Smad transactivation in reporter assays and affects subcellular distribution of Smad proteins. Activated TAK1 also interferes with BMP-dependent osteogenic development in murine mesenchymal progenitor cells (C3H10T½). A potential TAK1-mediated apoptosis process could be excluded for these cells. Both synergistic and interfering influences of TAK1 on BMP-mediated Smad-signaling have been reported previously. We suggest that TAK1 is a factor that is involved in the fine-tuning of BMP effects during osteogenic development.

TAK1 mediates activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB pathways (4Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K.

However, molecular details of the signaling cascade(s) involving TAK1 still remain to be elucidated, especially with regard to the initial steps. During the past few years, the intracellular mechanisms leading to propagation of signaling by TGF-β family members have been elucidated in significant detail. A family of eight intracellular proteins, termed Smad proteins (Smad1 to Smad8), has been identified in vertebrates, and its members transduce signals for TGF-β ligands including the BMPs (reviewed by Attisano and Wrana (6Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar)). Smad proteins can be classified into three types according to their structure and mechanism of action. The receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8, are directly phosphorylated and activated by a BMP type I receptor (IA, IB, and ALK2, which is also an activin receptor (ActR-I)). Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by activin or TGF-β type I receptors (ALK4/ActR-IB and ALK5/TβR-I, respectively) (7Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar, 8Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Another Smad type, the common mediator Smad (Co-Smad; Smad4), associates with activated R-Smads, although hetero-oligomeric activated R-Smad complexes without Smad4 have also been detected (reviewed in Refs. 9Ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar and 10Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Smad complexes accumulate in the nucleus and participate in the regulation of target genes. This occurs predominantly by binding to other transcription factors and transcriptional regulators (for a review see Moustakas et al. (10Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). However, direct DNA binding of some Smads via their MH1 domain, or even a combination of both mechanisms, may also operate for many target genes. The third type of Smads interferes with the activation of, and subsequent complex formation by, R-Smads and is termed anti-Smads or inhibitory Smads (I-Smads, Smad6 and Smad7) (11Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y.B. Cai J.X. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Contrasting results on the biological role of TAK1-activated cascades in TGF-β/BMP signaling have been reported. In particular, a synergism for Smad and MAPK signaling cascades has been postulated (14Cocolakis E. Lemay S. Ali S. Lebrun J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18430-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 15Uchida K. Suzuki H. Ohashi T. Nitta K. Yumura W. Nihei H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For instance, Smad and TAK1 pathways integrate ATF-2 as a common nuclear target in cells stimulated with TGF-β (16Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. GotohMandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). TAK1 was reported to restore the ability of P19CL6[noggin] cells to differentiate into cardiac myocytes mimicking the effect of BMP2 upon these cells, whereas forced expression of a dominant-negative form of TAK1 interfered with this induced differentiation (17Monzen K. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Akazawa H. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ishii S. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). TAK1 (co-expressed with its activator protein TAB1) has been proposed to synergize with Smads and to induce ventral mesoderm formation in Xenopus embryos, thereby mimicking BMP activity. This is substantiated by the fact that dominant-negative TAK1 (with a K63W mutation) is able to antagonize the effects of BMPs (18Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, other reports document that the p38 signaling pathway, which can be activated by TAK1, mediates Smad-independent TGF-β responses or even interferes with Smad activity (19Yu L. Hebert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 20Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Biol.

A physical interaction between the inhibitory I-Smad6 molecule and TAK1 has also been observed (14Cocolakis E. Lemay S. Ali S. Lebrun J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18430-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Kimura N. Matsuo R. Shibuya H. Nakashima K. Taga T. J. Biol.

These observations prompted us to study potential molecular interactions between TAK1 and Smad proteins in more detail. We tested the ability of TAK1 to modify mesenchymal cell differentiation along the osteogenic/chondrogenic pathway in murine mesenchymal stem cells (C3H10T½ cells). This cell line can differentiate into myoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts (24Taylor S.M. Jones P.A. Cell. 1979; 17: 771-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 25Wang E.A. Israel D.I. Kelly S. Luxenberg D.P. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 26Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schröder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It has been documented recently that forced expression of the BMP-dependent signaling protein Smad1, some of its domains, or Smad5 induces osteogenic but not chondrogenic differentiation in C3H10T½ (27Ju W. Hoffmann A. Verschueren K. Tylzanowski P. Kaps C. Gross G. Huylebroeck D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1889-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that TAK1 directly interacts with the MH2 domain of the entire Smad family of signaling mediators and that TAK1 interferes with BMP-mediated signaling cascades that normally lead to osteogenesis in C3H10T½ cells. Generation of TAK1 Expression Plasmids—Based upon the published sequence of murine TAK1 (GenBank™ accession number D76446), a forward primer harboring an EcoRI and reverse primer with a BamHI restriction site (underlined) were generated for cloning of wild-type (wt) TAK1: forward 5′-TATAGAATTCCGCGGGGGATCATGTCGACAGCC and reverse 5′-TATAGGATCCTCATCACTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAGTCTGAAGTGCCTTGTCGTTTCTGCTG. The reverse primer additionally contained a sequence encoding a single FLAG epitope sequence. Expand™ High Fidelity enzyme (Roche Applied Science) was used to perform PCR on cDNA from murine kidney. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a single DNA product of about the expected size (1740 bp), which was used for cloning into the eukaryotic expression vector pMT7T3 (26Ahrens M. Ankenbauer T. Schröder D. Hollnagel A. Mayer H. Gross G. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The entire TAK1-cDNA insert was sequenced on both strands (BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Mix, Applied Biosystems-PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with the ABI Prism 310 capillary sequencer. By using this expression plasmid as template, constitutively active TAK1 (lacking the 22 N-terminal amino acids as described by Yamaguchi et al. (1Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe T. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar)) was generated. Additionally, dominant-negative TAK1 (K63W) was generated with standard methods using the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To investigate the tissue-specific expression of murine TAK1 splice variants by PCR, the following primers were used: forward, 5′-CAACTCAGCCACCAGCACAGG, and reverse, 5′-GACTGCGAGCTGGCTTCTCTG. For Co-IP studies, TAK1 variants were re-cloned with the C-terminal FLAG or HA tags into pcDNA3. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Cells and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells, murine C2C12 myoblasts, and C3H10T½ progenitor cells and C3H10T½-BMP2 were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The features of C3H10T½-BMP2 cells have been described (28Hollnagel A. Ahrens M. Gross G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1993-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Bächner D. Ahrens M. Schroder D. Hoffmann A. Lauber J. Betat N. Steinert P. Flohe L. Gross G. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 398-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recombinant human BMP4 and TGF-β1 were purchased from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany), and recombinant human IL-1β was from RELIATech GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). Recombinant human BMP2 from Escherichia coli was prepared as described (30Vallejo L.F. Brokelmann M. Marten S. Trappe S. Cabrera-Crespo J. Hoffmann A. Gross G. Weich H.A. Rinas U. J. Biotechnol. 2002; 94: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). C3H10T½-BMP2 cells were stably transfected with expression plasmids encoding wt TAK1, dominant-negative (dn) or constitutively active (ca) TAK1 in pMT7T3-f1 using DOSPER™ according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science) together with a selection plasmid conferring puromycin resistance (pBSpacΔp, parental C3H10T½ cells) or G418 resistance (pAG60, BMP2-expressing C3H10T½ cells). Individual clones were picked, propagated, and tested for recombinant expression of TAK1 variants by RT-PCR using a vector-specific and a gene-specific primer. Control cell lines (empty expression vector) were established at the same time. Selected cell clones were subcultivated in the presence of puromycin (5 μg/ml) or puromycin/G418 (5 μg/ml + 750 μg/ml), and the selective pressure was maintained during the entire cultivation period. Transient transfections of HEK293T cells and C2C12 were performed using FuGENE 6 as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). The quantities of transfected DNA were kept constant by adding an appropriate amount of empty vector (31Verschueren K. Remacle J. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G.

In Vitro Osteogenic/Chondrogenic Differentiation—Stable cell lines expressing recombinant TAK1wt, TAK1ca, or TAK1dn, parental C3H10T½ cells (C3H10T½wt) and C3H10T½ cells constitutively expressing BMP2 (C3H10T½-BMP2) were plated at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2. After reaching confluence (arbitrarily termed day 0), ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) and β-glycerophosphate (10 mm) were added as specified by Owen et al. (32Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M.

Recombinant cells cultured in Roux flasks (25 cm2) were harvested at different time points at (day 0) and after (days 4, 7, 10, 13) confluence in TriReagentLS or fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, respectively. Cell pellets were used for protein analysis by Western blot. Protein was extracted from the cell pellets as described under “Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting.” Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, and equal amounts (25 μg/lane) of total protein were analyzed by Western blot. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was determined after fixation of cells with ethanol for 30 min at 4 °C followed by wash with PBS. Enzyme activity in the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm by measuring the conversion to p-nitrophenol from p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 50 mm Na2CO3 at pH 9.5 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 60 min. One unit was defined as the activity catalyzing the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate/min. Histological Methods and Verification of Cellular Phenotypes—Alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblasts was visualized by cellular staining with SIGMA FAST 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Proteoglycan-secreting chondrocytes were identified by staining with Alcian blue at pH 2.5 (Alcian blue 8GS, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). RNA Preparation and Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was prepared by TriReagentLS according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Research Center Inc., Ohio, MS). Five μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primers, and cDNA aliquots were subjected to PCR. RT-PCR was normalized by the transcriptional levels of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (cf. Fig. 8). The primer pairs and PCR conditions used to evaluate osteogenic/chondrogenic differentiation for collagen Ia1, collagen IIa1, osteocalcin, and the PTH/PTHrP receptor have been described (27Ju W.

Endogenous complexes were isolated with TAK1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-7162), Smad1 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., catalog number 06-653), or HA-antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-805) covalently coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (Seize X Protein G immunoprecipitation kit, Pierce catalog number 45210). Cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using the appropriate antibodies. Phospho-Smad1 (catalog number 9511) as well as p38 and pp38 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (catalog number 9210); Smad2/3 antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (catalog number 610842), and phospho-Smad2 antibodies were a gift from C.-H. Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). GAL4-antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog number sc-510). Exposed films were scanned with the Epson scanner 1680 Pro and quantified by analysis on a PC using the public domain NIH Image program “ImageJ” (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Reporter Assays—Reporter assays using the GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to various forms of Smad proteins were performed as described (34Meersseman G. Verschueren K. Nelles L. Blumenstock C. Kraft H.

Briefly, 420 ng of DNA were transfected/well of a 24-well plate seeded with 1 × 105 HEK293T cells the day before transfection. The DNA mix included a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase under the strong constitutive Rous sarcoma virus promoter for normalization purposes and a reporter plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under the control of five GAL4-binding sites upstream of a minimal TATA box (pG5 luc, Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and combinations of effector plasmids. Where appropriate, transfection reactions were supplemented with empty vector. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed with a detergent lysis solution (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). β-Galactosidase activity was measured with the luminescent β-galactosidase kit II from Clontech and luciferase activity with the luciferase assay system from Promega. All results are expressed as luciferase activity normalized to β-galactosidase values (“relative luciferase activities”). Reporter assays with the Smad1 DNA-binding element SBE-9 (GCCGx9) (35Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), were performed similarly except that cells were lysed in CAT lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science). CAT enzyme was measured with the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and β-galactosidase with the chemiluminescent β-galactosidase reporter gene assay (both manufactured by Roche Applied Science). Immunofluorescence—For endogenous immunofluorescence studies with cytokine or growth factor treatments, C3H101/2 or C2C12 cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass chamber slides at 8,500 c/cm2. The following day, cells were switched to serum-free medium for 1 h, then treated with 50 ng/ml IL-1 for 10 min (or solvent as control), and then with 50 ng/ml recombinant human BMP2 for an additional 30 min. For overexpression studies, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs as described above. Then cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized with methanol followed by 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBT), blocking was performed with 5% fetal calf serum in PBT for 1 h followed by an overnight incubation in blocking buffer containing appropriate primary antibodies. The detection was done with goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (A-11001, Molecular Probes) antibody for murine primary antibodies at 5 μg/ml or goat anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (A-11011, Molecular Probes) for rabbit primary antibodies or vice versa.

To generate the ALK2 bait construct, cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of mouse ALK2 was generated by PCR and cloned into pGBT9. Fractionation Procedure—HEK293T cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and the cytosol fraction was obtained by lysis on ice for 10 min with hypotonic buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets, Roche Applied Science). After a low speed centrifugation (4500 rpm, 1 min) nuclear pellets were resuspended in high salt lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm PMSF, protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets, Roche Applied Science)). After 10 min of lysis on ice nuclear extracts were clarified by centrifugation (7500 rpm, 2 min). Equal amounts of protein in cytosolic and nuclear extracts were loaded on SDS gels for Western detection. Experiments with Short Interfering (si) RNAs—The following sequence for TAK1-siRNA was synthesized according to Ref. 37Sakurai H. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Nakano H. Okazaki T. Chino A. Doi T. Saiki I.

The siRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) and delivered in a deprotected, desalted, and annealed form. For transient transfections, 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (1 mg/ml, Invitrogen) were mixed with 200 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Additionally, 4 μl of siRNA duplex (20 μm) were mixed with 200 μl of Opti-MEM. Then the Lipofectamine-containing mix was added dropwise to the siRNA-containing mix and incubated at room temperature for another 20 min. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended at 400,000 cells/ml in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and were added to the Lipofectamine/siRNA mix. These mixes were seeded immediately into wells of a 6-well dish and incubated for 4 h before addition of medium with serum (20%) overnight. 35,000 cells/ml were reseeded into poly-d-lysine-coated LabTek glass chamber slides (12,000 c/cm2 in 2 well chamber slides, Nunc). After another overnight incubation, cells were starved for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before addition of IL-1 at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml (or solvent as control) for 5 min followed by treatment with 50 ng/ml BMP2 for another 30 min. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue Distribution of Murine TAK1 Splice Variants—To investigate both the interactions of TAK1 with Smads and the biological activity for TAK1 in C3H10T1/2 cells, full-length TAK1 cDNA was generated by PCR, starting from total murine kidney RNA, using primers encompassing the N- and C-terminal coding sequences of the protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). At that time, the isolated TAK1 cDNA was an undescribed murine splice variant with a high identity to human TAK1b. Recently, the sequence of this unspliced murine TAK1 variant sequence has been confirmed in an independent study (GenBank™ accession number XM_131329; Fig. 1a). Deletions generated by alternative splicing are located in the C-terminal part of the protein and do not affect the kinase domain (Fig. 1a). Among the nine tissues examined, both the murine TAK1 long and short splice variant mRNAs are expressed in any tissue tested apart from kidney where the long form is prevailing (Fig. 1c). In gut and testis, this long form is also predominantly expressed, whereas in muscle and brain the shorter form is more abundant. The uterus, heart, and liver express both splice variants in similar amounts. In lung tissue, TAK1 mRNA seems not to be expressed at detectable levels. The mRNA of both TAK1 splice variants is also expressed in comparable amounts in C3H10T½ cells (see Fig. 8a, below). The capacity of our cloned longer TAK1 variants to activate the endogenous p38 pathway was investigated by transient overexpression of the wild-type protein (TAK1wt) and two variants, constitutively active TAK1 (TAK1ca) and dominant-negative TAK1 (TAK1dn) in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1b). Here TAK1wt and TAK1ca were considerably more active in activating the p38 pathway than TAK1dn. A basal level of phosphorylated p38 (pp38) in TAK1dn expressing cells is expected because several pathways converge on this p"
https://openalex.org/W1988481644,"Fas (CD95) mediates apoptosis of many cell types, but the susceptibility of cells to killing by Fas ligand and anti-Fas antibodies is highly variable. Jurkat T cells lacking CD47 (integrin-associated protein) are relatively resistant to Fas-mediated death but are efficiently killed by Fas ligand or anti-Fas IgM (CH11) upon expression of CD47. Lack of CD47 impairs events downstream of Fas activation including caspase activation, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA cleavage. Neither CD47 signaling nor raft association of CD47 is required to enable Fas apoptosis. CH11 induces association of Fas and CD47. Primary T cells from CD47-null mice are also protected from Fas-mediated killing relative to wild type T cells. Thus CD47 associates with Fas upon its activation and augments Fas-mediated apoptosis. Fas (CD95) mediates apoptosis of many cell types, but the susceptibility of cells to killing by Fas ligand and anti-Fas antibodies is highly variable.

Fas (CD95) is expressed on many cell types and mediates apoptosis during development in response to stress and in normal functioning of the immune system. Fas-mediated apoptosis is regulated by modulation of expression levels of Fas and Fas ligand (1Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar) as well as downstream regulators of the death pathway (2Nagata S. Annu. Rev.

Thus, the susceptibility of cells to killing by Fas ligand and anti-Fas antibodies is highly variable, particularly in leukocytes such as T cells, where activation and developmental status play a role in regulating Fas-mediated killing (4Siegel R.M.

Expression of Fas per se does not automatically lead to cell death, because other proteins play important roles in regulating Fas-mediated killing. There are several well characterized cases in which expression or modification of intracellular proteins inhibits or promotes apoptotic events downstream of Fas (3Peter M.E. Krammer P.H.

In contrast, few examples exist in which Fas activity is modulated in either a positive or negative fashion by membrane proteins expressed in cis (7Moorman J.P. Prayther D. McVay D. Hahn Y.S.

CD47 can augment integrin function through signaling via heterotrimeric Gi (14Frazier W.A. Gao A.-G. Dimitry J. Chung J. Brown E.J. Lindberg F.P. Linder M.E. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), can induce a novel, caspase-independent, but partially Gi-dependent form of apoptosis characterized by rapid mitochondrial dysfunction and annexin V display. In the course of these experiments we observed that a Jurkat T cell line deficient in CD47 expression (JinB8) was much less sensitive than wild-type Jurkat cells to killing by the anti-Fas IgM mAb CH11 (17Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the potential role of CD47 in Fas-mediated apoptosis and report that CD47 augments Fas-dependent apoptosis not only in Jurkat T cells but in normal mouse T cells as well. The activation of Fas causes it to associate with the extracellular IgV domain of CD47, leading to enhanced activation of downstream, caspase-dependent death pathways. Cell Lines and Reagents—JE6.1 (CD47+/+), JinB8 (CD47-/-) and JinB8–315 (CD47+/+) have been described earlier (17Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). β1 integrin-deficient Jurkat T cells were provided by Dr. Yoji Shimizu (University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis). All Jurkat cell lines were cultured in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and G418 (1 mg/ml) as needed. JINB8 cells transfected with the extracellular domain of CD47 linked to GPI (pIAP148) and CD7 (pIAP323) were provided by Dr. Eric Brown (University of California, San Francisco). Anti-human CD95 antibody CH-11 (IgM) was obtained from Coulter Immunotech. Anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies 1F7 (IgG1), 2D3 (IgG1), and B6H12 (IgG1) have been described previously (15Green J.M.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3419-3425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Annexin V apoptosis detection kit, phycoerythrin-labeled anti-active caspase-3, mouse anti-human PARP antibody, mouse anti-human caspase-7, anti-mouse FAS antibody Jo-2, and DX-2 were from Pharmingen, San Diego, CA. C6-ceramide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MitoTracker® red CMXRos was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The DNeasy® tissue kit was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Anti-human cytochrome c antibodies SC-7159 and SC-13561 and Rabbit anti-Fas antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Z-VAD-fmk was from BIOMOL (Butler Pike, PA). Polyclonal anti-human caspase-3 antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Clonogenic Survival Assay—The clonogenic assay was done according to the method described by Johnstone et al. (23Johnstone R. Cretney W.E. Smyth M.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. Cells (10 μl from a stock of 1 × 105 cells/ml) treated with various apoptotic stimuli were plated in triplicate on soft agar. Cells were diluted in 5 ml of RPMI containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, the supplements listed above, and 0.3% noble agar (Difco, Detroit, MI) and plated in 60-mm dishes. Once set, the dishes were overlaid with 2.5 ml of medium and incubated at 37 °C. In some wells, cells were preincubated for 2 h with 100 μmol of the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk as indicated in Fig. 1. After 12 days, the total number of colonies/plate was counted. Data were calculated as mean ± S.D. of triplicate determination and are representative of three individual experiments with similar results. Apoptosis Initiated by L Cells Expressing Fas Ligand—Fas ligand (FASL)-transfected and mock-transfected L cells (104) were cultured overnight in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and β-mercaptoethanol. The L cells attached firmly to the plate. Any unbound cells were removed by repeated washing. JE6.1, JINB8, and JINB8–315 cells were cultured on the L cells for 8–10 h. The loose cells were collected after gentle shaking and analyzed for annexin V staining and staining with W6/32 to confirm their identity as human Jurkat cells. Isolation of Primary T Cells from Wild Type and CD47-deficient Mice—Splenic T cells were isolated from both wild type and CD47-deficient mice (back-crossed more than 16 generations to The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, C57Bl/6 strain). In brief, single cell suspensions were made from spleens with collagenase digestion in phosphate-buffered saline. The red blood cells were lysed by lysing buffer. The mononuclear cells were adhered to a Petri dish for 2–4 h. The nonadherent cells (107) were collected and treated with saturating concentrations of anti-mouse CD14, CD16, and CD19 plus immunomagnetic Dynal beads to remove monocytes, NK cells, and B cells, respectively. The bead-adhered cells were removed with a magnet, and the process was repeated three times. The supernatant contained more than 98% CD3+ T cells as judged by flow cytometry. Cell viability was always >98% as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Apoptosis Induction and Detection—3 × 105 Jurkat T cells were treated with 5 μg/ml 1F7, B6/H12, or 2D3, 100 ng/ml of anti-Fas antibody CH-11 (IgM), or 40 μm cell-permeable C6-ceramide for 6–8 h in 24-well plates (Nunc). In some experiments the cells were pretreated with Z-VAD-fmk, 100 μm for a period of 2 h, before exposure to 1F7 or CH-11. After 6 h the cells were harvested and analyzed for apoptosis (17Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was determined by monitoring changes in cell size and externalization of phosphatidylserine by flow cytometry after exposure to FITC-labeled annexin V according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested, stained with FITC-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry using the CellQuest software program. A minimum of 10,000 cells was analyzed in each case with triplicate determinations. Determination of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (ΔΨm)— The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in T cells was studied using flow cytometry as described (17Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cells (3 × 105) treated as described above were stained with 40 μm CMXRos in serum-free medium and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and analyzed by FACS analysis. DNA Fragmentation Analysis—3 × 105 Jurkat T cells were treated as above for 24 h. Genomic DNA was prepared using a DNeasy® tissue kit (Qiagen). Approximately 5 μg of DNA was separated electrophoretically on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). Western Blot Analysis of Apoptotic Events—1 × 106 cells were treated as indicated for 6 h in 24-well plates. The cells were harvested, sonicated for 10 s, resuspended in solubilization buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 165 mm NaCl), run on 10% SDS-PAGE in NuPAGE MOPS/SDS running buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were immunoblotted with primary antibody detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (16McDonald J.F. Zheleznyak A. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17301-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For the detection of cytochrome c, a membrane fraction and a cytosolic fraction were prepared after treatment. Briefly, 2 × 106 cell were collected, washed twice in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Cells were then passed through a fine gauge needle several times and allowed to swell for 20 min on ice. The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to clear the debris. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 20 min. The pellet was used as a heavy membrane fraction, whereas the supernatant was used as a cytosolic fraction. The fractions were run on 10% SDS-PAGE as described above. Detection of signals was by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Confocal Microscopy—JE6.1 cells were treated with medium alone or with 1F7 (5 μg/ml) or CH-11 (100 ng/ml) for 3 h and allowed to adhere on polylysine-coated coverslips. The coverslips were fixed with 2% p-HCHO followed by permeabilization with n-α-d-glucopyranoside (7 mg/ml). Cells were stained with rabbit anti-CD95 and 2D3 anti-CD47 mouse mAb for 45 min followed by staining with TRITC- and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on freshly cleaned slides with anti-quencher (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal system on a Zeiss microscope with a 63× objective. Immunoprecipitation of CD47-Fas Complexes—JE6.1, JinB8, or Fas-null Jurkat cells (2.5 × 106) were incubated with magnetic beads (M-450, sheep anti-mouse IgG or rat anti-mouse IgM (Dynal, Lake Success, NY)) coated with CH11, 1F7, or other mAb for 1 h at 37 °C,and then lysed with 10 mm CHAPS in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, with protease inhibitor mixture (complete mini, Roche Applied Science). In some cases, 100 ng/ml CH11 mAb or 10 μg/ml F(ab′)2 of anti-CD47 mAb was added in soluble form. Beads were separated with a magnet, washed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE with (Fas blots) or without (CD47 blots) reduction. Transfers were blotted with anti-CD47 mAb B6H12 or anti-Fas C-terminal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Detection of appropriate secondary antibodies was done with chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce). Expression of CD47 Promotes Apoptosis—We had previously reported that a CD47-null mutant of Jurkat cells (JinB8) was much less sensitive to killing by the anti-Fas IgM CH11 (17Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Using derivatives of the Jurkat JE6.1 cell line lacking CD47 or β1 integrin (primarily α4β1 in Jurkat cells), we have now examined this finding in more detail. We assessed the induction of apoptosis in two ways. After apoptotic treatments, cells were stained with fluorescent annexin V to detect exposure of phosphatidylserine on their surface (Fig. 1A, bottom). In addition to this rapid assay, a clonogenic survival assay was also employed to assure that we were detecting a true commitment to die and not just early, potentially reversible, changes (Fig. 1A, top). To be sure that a previously unknown mutation in the JinB8 cells was not responsible for our observations, we reexpressed WT CD47 in the JinB8 line (JinB8-315 cells). A shown in Fig. 1A, lack of CD47 strongly inhibited the ability of CH11 to kill Jurkat cells as detected in both the short term and clonogenic assays. All killing was blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor (PCI) Z-VAD-fmk. The anti-CD47 mAb 1F7 killed all of the Jurkat lines that expressed CD47. Re-expression of CD47 (in JinB8-315) restored sensitivity to CH11 killing, indicating that lack of CD47, and not another mutation in JinB8, was responsible for resistance to CH11. In contrast to the effect of CH11, JinB8 cells were not resistant to apoptosis initiated by C6-ceramide in either the short term annexin V assay or in the clonogenic assay. Treatment with C6-ceramide resulted in death of all cell lines whether or not CD47 was expressed. (Fig. 1A). In Jurkat cells, CD47 has been shown to associate with α4β1 integrin (10Li Z. Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Cashel J.A. Krutzsch H.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, Jurkat cells deficient in β1 integrins were just as sensitive to killing by CH11 or 1F7 as WT Jurkat cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that these effects of CD47 did not depend on its association with α4β1 or α5β1 integrin. To determine whether the physiological ligand of Fas gave the same results as mAb CH11, we exposed JE6.1, JinB8, and JinB8–315 cells (expressing identical levels of Fas, Fig. 1B, right) to Fas ligand expressed on cells, the form in which it is usually encountered in a physiological setting. L cells expressing FASL+ effectively killed JE6.1 cells and Jin B8–315 cells, but the JinB8 cells were much less sensitive to cell-bound Fas ligand (Fig. 1B, top). Control L cell transfectants lacking FASL did not kill any of the cell types (Fig. 1B, top). As mentioned above, killing was prevented by the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Trimeric recombinant Fas ligand was also used to induce cell death (Fig. 1B, bottom) with results very similar to Fas ligand presented on the L cells. Again, C6-ceramide killed the cells independently of CD47 expression. Fas Is Not Necessary for Killing by CD47 mAb 1F7—To determine whether Fas played a role in CD47-dependent cell killing, we selected several clones of Jurkat cells that grew in the presence of CH11 and were found to lack Fas/CD95 expression (Fig. 2A). These Fas-negative cells were efficiently killed by 1F7 but not by CH11 (Fig. 2B), indicating that CD47-mediated killing was not Fas-dependent as suggested previously by the failure of caspase inhibitors to block 1F7 killing of Jurkat cells (17Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Fas-null Jurkat cells were efficiently killed by ceramide (Fig. 2B). DX-2 and SC-21730 are anti-Fas antibodies that block the effect of CH11 and prevent its killing of Jurkat cells (Fig. 2C). DX-2 or SC-21730 had no effect on killing of Jurkat cells by 1F7 or ceramide (Fig. 2C). CD47-deficient JinB8 Cells Are Unable to Activate Pathways Downstream of FAS—The following events were defective in CH11-treated CD47-null cells: cleavage/activation of executioner caspase-7 and initiator caspase-8 (Fig. 3A), cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP (Fig. 3B), cytochrome c release (Fig. 3C), collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3D), and DNA laddering (Fig. 3E). Transfection of JinB8 cells with a full-length CD47 expression plasmid (JinB8-315 cells) restored all of these downstream responses to CH11 (Fig. 3, A–E). This suggests that CD47 affects Fas function at a step upstream of caspase activation. The IgV Domain of CD47 Is Sufficient to Enable Fas-mediated Apoptosis—To determine whether the transmembrane signaling domain of CD47 was necessary to enable Fas-mediated killing, we reconstituted CD47-deficient JinB8 cells with CD47 constructs in which the IgV domain is linked to the single transmembrane peptide of CD7 (pIAP323) or to a GPI anchor sequence (pIAP148) (24Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7672-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The CD47-GPI construct has been shown to concentrate in GEMS or raft domains, whereas the CD47-CD7 construct is completely excluded from these domains in Jurkat cells (24Rebres R.A. Green J.M. Reinhold M.I. Ticchioni M. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7672-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We chose clones of transfected JinB8 cells that expressed the same level of CD47 IgV domain (Fig. 4, top) and made sure that the transfected lines expressed the same level of Fas (not shown). To our surprise, both the CD47-GPI and the CD47-CD7 chimeras reconstituted CH11 killing of the Jurkat cells to the same extent as transfection of WT, full-length CD47. Further, both chimeras reconstituted Fas killing to the same extent, indicating that the ability of CD47 to concentrate in GEMS or rafts was not essential to enable Fas apoptosis (Fig. 4, bottom). Killing by ceramide was equivalent in all cases (Fig. 4). Thus only the IgV domain tethered to the plasma membrane via a heterologous anchor is sufficient to restore Fas-dependent killing. Both of these chimeric forms of CD47 lack the ability to couple to Gi (14Frazier W.A. Gao A.-G. Dimitry J. Chung J. Brown E.J. Lindberg F.P. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8554-8560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15Green J.M. Zhelesnyak A.M. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 14: 673-682Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Further, pertussis toxin does not inhibit CH11 killing (17Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus CD47 signaling via transmembrane interactions with Gi or other intracellular signaling molecules is unnecessary for Fas killing. Rather, a cis interaction between CD47 and Fas or a Fas-associated protein on the plasma membrane is likely to be required, and the association of CD47 with GEMS or rafts is not essential. CD47 Associates with Fas—Because of the above mentioned data, we investigated whether CD47 and Fas could associate with one another. We reasoned that if such an association within the plane of the membrane is necessary for CD47 to enable Fas function, then there might exist monoclonal antibodies directed against the IgV domain of CD47 that could block this interaction. 1F7 and Ad22 are the only mAbs of a large panel of anti-CD47 mAbs that efficiently induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells (17Manna P.P. Frazier W.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Pettersen R.D. Hestdal K. Olafsen M.K. Lie S.O. Lindberg F.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7031-7040PubMed Google Scholar). The epitopes of 1F7 and Ad22 on the CD47 IgV domain are coincident and are spatially separated from epitopes of mAbs such as 2D3, which also recognize the IgV domain of CD47 (25Brown E.J. Hopper L. Ho T. Gresham H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). 2A. Zheleznyak and W. A. Frazier, unpublished data. We tested a number of anti-CD47 mAbs for their effect on CH11 killing of JE6.1 cells in both the short term (annexin V) and clonogenic assays. Two of these nonlethal anti-CD47 mAbs (2D3 and 2B7.1) protected Jurkat cells against CH11 killing to the extent of about 50% (Fig. 5), whereas anti-CD3 or anti-HLA (W6/32) mAbs, both of which bind well to Jurkat cells, had no effect. This suggests that mAbs such as 2D3 and 2B7.1 block the association of CD47 with Fas or a Fas-associated protein. To further investigate the possible association of CD47 and Fas, we employed confocal fluorescence microscopy of Jurkat cells. With no prior antibody treatment, CD47 and Fas are both expressed on the surface of Jurkat cells but do not appear to colocalize (Fig. 6, top row). However, upon treatment with CH11, CD47 and Fas become strongly colocalized on T cells (Fig. 6, bottom row). The apparent increase in intensity in the presence of CH11 is indicative of clustering of the antigens. In contrast, treatment with the lethal anti-CD47 mAb 1F7 does not lead to colocalization of CD47 and Fas (Fig. 6, middle row). This result corroborates our observation that Fas-mediated apoptosis requires the presence of CD47, whereas CD47-mediated killing is independent of Fas. The association of CD47 and Fas was also examined using co-immunoisolation approaches. Magnetic beads coated with CH11 were incubated with WT Jurkat cells or JinB8 cells. The cells were lysed, and the bound, Fas-associated proteins were detected by Western blotting of SDS gels. CD47 was associated with Fas in WT but not in JinB8 Jurkat cells (Fig. 7A). Because JinB8 cells do not express CD47, this serves as a control for the identity of the band illuminated in the anti-CD47 blot. In the converse approach, beads coated with the anti-CD47 mAb 1F7 were bound to JE6.1, JinB8, or the Fas-null Jurkat cells and analyzed for the association of Fas. As expected, no Fas band was detected in immunoprecipitates from JinB8 (CD47-null) or Fas-null Jurkat cells (not shown). Fas was detected in CD47 immunoprecipitates from wild type JE6.1 cells (Fig. 7B) and from JinB8 cells reconstituted with CD47 (not shown). When a small amount (100 ng/ml) of soluble CH11 anti-Fas mAb (sufficient to induce apoptosis in above experiments) was added during the incubation of cells with the anti-CD47-coated beads, the amount of Fas detected in association with CD47 was increased. The extent of the increase varied from one experiment to the next because the amount of Fas associated with CD47 in the absence of CH11 varied from undetectable to rather substantial amounts (as shown in Fig. 7B). This suggests that this basal association of CD47 and Fas is quite weak and easily perturbed upon cell lysis. This notion is further supported by the observation that adding the 1F7-coated beads to cells after detergent lysis resulted in no detectable association of Fas with CD47 (not shown). These experiments again suggest that activation or ligation of Fas promotes its association with CD47, as indicated in Fig. 6. Thus both confocal microscopy and immunoisolation support the activation-dependent association of Fas with CD47. Because mAbs 2D3 and 2B7.1 directed against the IgV domain of CD47 were seen to inhibit Fas killing (Fig. 5) we tested these mAbs and two others to see if they could block the association of CD47 with Fas detected in these co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This was done by treating JE6.1 cells with F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-CD47 mAbs prior to the addition of soluble CH11 to induce the association of Fas with CD47. As seen in Fig. 7B, the F(ab′)2 fragments of 2D3 and 2B7.1 as well as 2E11, a mAb with an epitope that coincides with that of 2D3, significantly block the co-isolation of CD47 with Fas. Anti-CD47 mAb B6H12 binds to an epitope that overlaps that of 1F7, the immunoprecipitating mAb, and thus inhibits association of 1F7 with cell surface CD47. DX-2 is an anti-Fas IgG. Thus the amount of Fas recovered with this mAb suggests that a substantial portio"

Goodpasture epitopes in the native autoantigen are cryptic (sequestered) within the NC1 hexamers of the α3α4α5(IV) collagen network. The biochemical mechanism for crypticity and exposure for autoantibody binding is not known. We now report that crypticity is a feature of the quaternary structure of two distinct subsets of α3α4α5(IV) NC1 hexamers: autoantibody-reactive M-hexamers containing only monomer subunits and autoantibody-impenetrable D-hexamers composed of both dimer and monomer subunits. Goodpasture antibodies only breach the quaternary structure of M-hexamers, unmasking the cryptic epitopes, whereas D-hexamers are resistant to autoantibodies under native conditions. The epitopes of D-hexamers are structurally sequestered by dimer reinforcement of the quaternary complex, which represents a new molecular solution for conferring immunologic privilege to a potential autoantigen. Dissociation of non-reinforced M-α3α4α5(IV) hexamers by Goodpasture antibodies is a novel mechanism whereby pathogenic autoantibodies gain access to cryptic B cell epitopes. These findings provide fundamental new insights into immune privilege and the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of human autoimmune Goodpasture disease."
https://openalex.org/W2137387674,"Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP, vitamin B6), a cofactor in many enzymatic reactions, has two distinct biosynthetic routes, which do not coexist in any organism. Two proteins, known as PdxS and PdxT, together form a PLP synthase in plants, fungi, archaea, and some eubacteria. PLP synthase is a heteromeric glutamine amidotransferase in which PdxT produces ammonia from glutamine and PdxS combines ammonia with five- and three-carbon phosphosugars to form PLP. In the 2.2-Å crystal structure, PdxS is a cylindrical dodecamer of subunits having the classic (β/α)8 barrel fold. PdxS subunits form two hexameric rings with the active sites positioned on the inside. The hexamer and dodecamer forms coexist in solution. A novel phosphate-binding site is suggested by bound sulfate. The sulfate and another bound molecule, methyl pentanediol, were used to model the substrate ribulose 5-phosphate, and to propose catalytic roles for residues in the active site. The distribution of conserved surfaces in the PdxS dodecamer was used to predict a docking site for the glutaminase partner, PdxT.

Despite the importance of PLP, its biosynthesis was unknown until recently. Two distinct de novo PLP biosynthetic pathways have been characterized, which do not coexist in organisms that produce PLP (1Tanaka T. Tateno Y. Gojobori T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The first pathway is employed by many eubacteria, such as Escherichia coli, to produce PLP from erythrose 4-phosphate and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (2Drewke C. Leistner E. Vitam.

The PLP nitrogen is derived from glutamate by transamination (4Tanaka K. Tazuya K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 2000; 46: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All E. coli genes encoding enzymes in this pathway have been identified, the pathway has been reconstituted in a cell-free system, and structures of most of the enzymes have been determined (5Cane D.E. Chimia. 2003; 57: 75-76Crossref Google Scholar). In the second B6 biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 1), which exists in some eubacteria and in archaea, fungi, plants, plasmodia, and some metazoa, the carbon skeleton of PLP is synthesized from an intact five-carbon pent(ul)ose unit and an intact three-carbon triose unit (6Zeidler J.

Soc. 2001; 123: 11353-11359Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Very recently these substrates were shown to be ribulose 5-phosphate (or ribose 5-phosphate) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (or dihydroxyacetone phosphate) (8Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The PLP nitrogen is derived from the amide group of glutamine (9Tazuya K. Adachi Y. Masuda K. Yamada K. Kumaoka H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Only two genes have been implicated in this pathway, which we refer to as the PdxS/PdxT pathway for the names of the corresponding gene products in Bacillus subtilis (10Belitsky B.R. J.

PdxS-like proteins have among the most highly conserved sequences to emerge from proteome comparisons (19Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our analysis of PdxS-like sequences shows that, among 91 sequences from all kingdoms of life (archaea, eubacteria and eukarya), all pairs of sequences are at least 60% identical, and ∼22% of the residue positions are strictly conserved. Sequence searches with PdxS and its homologs do not identify proteins of known structure, although PdxS homology to some members of the β/α barrel superfamily was predicted (19Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Bauer J.A. Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. J. Biol.

PdxT is a homolog of the glutaminase domains (or subunits) of several glutamine amidotransferases (19Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 443-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in accord with glutamine being the nitrogen source for the PdxS/PdxT pathway. PdxT is a member of the “Triad” family of glutaminase domains, characterized by a conserved Cys-His-Glu triad in the active site (22Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Purich D.L. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. Interscience Publishers, New York1998: 87-144Google Scholar), and is most similar to the glutaminase domain of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS), an enzyme from the histidine biosynthetic pathway. The expected Triad structure was observed in crystal structures of PdxT from B. subtilis (21Bauer J.A. Bennett E.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2704-2711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and from its thermophilic cousin Geobacillus stearothermophilus (PDB code 1Q7R). Considerable experimental evidence demonstrates that PdxS/PdxT is a heteromeric glutamine amidotransferase. PdxS and PdxT from B. subtilis form a physical complex (10Belitsky B.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), as do their homologs from yeast (20Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Glutaminase activity was detected for B. subtilis PdxT (10Belitsky B.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1191-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and yeast SNO1 (23Dong Y.X. Sueda S. Nikawa J. Kondo H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and this activity required the presence of the second subunit, B. subtilis PdxS or yeast SNZ1. The recent observation of PLP synthase activity in vitro with glutamine as a nitrogen substrate shows that the PdxS/PdxT complex, now known as PLP synthase, is indeed a glutamine amidotransferase having glutaminase (PdxT) and synthase (PdxS) subunits (8Burns K.E. Xiang Y. Kinsland C.L. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3682-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Glutamine amidotransferases are a group of about 20 enzymes that remove the amide nitrogen from glutamine and add it to another substrate (22Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Purich D.L. Advances in Enzymology and Related Areas of Molecular Biology. Interscience Publishers, New York1998: 87-144Google Scholar). The active sites for glutamine hydrolysis and ammonia addition are chemically distinct and are carried on different enzyme domains or subunits (24Binda C. Bossi R.T. Wakatsuki S. Arzt S. Coda A.

Ammonia generated by the glutaminase domain of the enzyme is sequestered by the protein and transferred through an internal tunnel between the active sites. The working model for PLP synthase catalysis is that ribulose 5-phosphate or ribose 5-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or dihydroxyacetone phosphate bind in the active site of PdxS where they combine with ammonia generated by PdxT to form PLP. Here we report the 2.2-Å crystal structure of PdxS from G. stearothermophilus. The PdxS dodecamer observed in the crystal exists in solution in equilibrium with a hexamer. Fortuitous binding of a crystal cryoprotectant molecule provides clues about the mode of ribulose 5-phosphate binding to PdxS and assignment of catalytic roles for some residues. A model of the PdxS/PdxT complex is proposed. Cloning of G. stearothermophilus pdxS—Escherichia coli strains JM107 (30Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar), XL1-Blue (Stratagene), and BL21(DE3) were used for plasmid construction and gene expression. For crystallization experiments, plasmids expressing two versions of the His6-tagged PdxS were constructed. pBB1186 encodes PdxS with a C-terminal His6-tag. The modified pdxS gene was synthesized by PCR, using the chromosomal DNA of G. stearothermophilus strain 10 (www.genome.ou.edu/bstearo.html) as a template, and oligonucleotides oBB126 (5′-CTTTTGCATGCCTCGCAAAGC) and oBB127 (5′-TTATTAAGCTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCCAGCCGCGTTCTTGCATC), as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively (the SphI and HindIII sites are underlined, and the histidine codons are in bold). The PCR fragment was cloned between the SphI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pBAD18 containing the inducible E. coli araBAD promoter (31Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar). pET0881 encodes PdxS with an N-terminal tag, including His6 and 26 other amino acids that provide thrombin and tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage sites (residue numbering of PdxS is relative to Met1 of the native protein). To create this plasmid, the modified pdxS gene was synthesized using pBB1186 as a template and oligonucleotides (5′-AAACATATGGCTAGCACAGGTACGGACCGCGTC) and (5′-TTTTTATTAAGCTTACCAGCCGCGTTCTTGCATCC) as forward and reverse primers, containing the NheI and HindIII sites, respectively (underlined). The PCR product was cloned between the NheI and HindIII sites of pETTEV281. Expression plasmid pETTEV281, a derivative of pET28a (Novagen), encodes a recognition site for TEV protease following the N-terminal His-Tag and the thrombin cleavage site. pETTEV281 was constructed as follows. First, the NdeI site upstream of the T7-Tag was replaced by a KpnI site by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange by Stratagene) using the primer 5′-CGCGCGGCAGCGGTACCGCTAGCATGACTGGTGGAC-3′ and its complement. A DNA sequence was designed to encode the TEV protease recognition site (32Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and to insert between the newly created KpnI site and the BamHI site in the multiple cloning region. A new NdeI site upstream and adjacent to the BamHI site was created for convenient transfer of DNA fragments between vectors. The annealed product of the designed oligonucleotides, had sticky ends (bold) for insertion between KpnI and BamHI sites (NdeI site is underlined, and the TEV protease cleavage site is indicated by ↓). The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated in a 120-ml reaction mixture (600 pmol of oligomer, 1 mm ATP, 40 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of 25 mm EDTA (final concentration) and the kinase removed by phenol extraction. The phosphorylated oligonucleotides were annealed at 95 °C and slowly cooled to room temperature. The annealed duplex was ligated into modified vector pET28a (no NdeI site) that had been digested by KpnI and BamHI under standard conditions. The ligation product was transformed into competent XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA from colonies was screened by restriction digestion for the new NdeI site, originating from the insert. DNA with the expected restriction pattern was sequenced at the Purdue Genomics Center to verify the construct and the plasmid was named pETTEV281. We were able to produce crystals using either C-terminal or N-terminal His6-tagged versions of PdxS. Below we describe the procedures used for purification and crystallization of the N-terminal His6 form of PdxS. Purification of PdxS—Cells of E. coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with plasmid pET0881 and grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Expression of pdxS was induced by addition of IPTG (final concentration 400 μm) when the A600 reached 0.8 and the culture was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 25 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl), and lysed by two passes through a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified cell extract was loaded onto a Ni2+-charged immobilized metal affinity chromatography column (HiTrap™ Chelating HP, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the extraction buffer. A gradient of 20-500 mm imidazole (in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl) was applied to the column. The N-terminal His-tagged PdxS eluted at ∼250 mm imidazole. Purified PdxS was dialyzed at room temperature against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, and concentrated to 20 mg/ml. The purified PdxS was extremely sensitive to pH and precipitated in solutions below pH 8. SeMet-PdxS was produced by the same protocol, except cells were grown in the SeMet minimal medium (33Guerrero S.A. Hecht H.J. Hofmann B. Biebl H. Singh M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) plus 50 mg of l-SeMet per liter. No reducing agent was used during purification. Purified SeMet-PdxS was dialyzed at room temperature against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Crystallization—PdxS was crystallized at 20 °C by vapor diffusion from a 1:1 mixture of protein (5 mg/ml PdxS, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 20 mm GDP, 20 mm MgCl2) and well solution (10-12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4). (GDP, which was used in our original trials, was found later to be unnecessary for PdxS crystallization.) Small crystals were washed in well solution, crushed, and diluted 105-fold for microseeding (1 μl) into drops containing 4 μl of protein solution and 4 μl of well solution. Large crystals (250 × 250 × 250 μm) grew in 3-5 weeks. Crystals of PdxS are in space group C222 (a = 162.5 Å, b = 163.9 Å, c = 186.8 Å) with six polypeptides in the asymmetric unit and ∼65% solvent. Crystals of SeMet-PdxS were grown under similar conditions at a slightly lower concentration of polyethylene glycol 8000. A mercury derivative crystal was produced by overnight soaking in well solution with 1 mm ethylmercuric phosphate, followed by a 1-min back-soak during cryoprotection. All crystals were cryoprotected by rapid sequential transfer through 5, 10, 15, and 17.5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) in well solution before flash freezing in a 100 K N2 gas stream. Data Collection and Processing—A 2.2 Å native data set was collected at APS beamline 19-ID (360 images of 0.5° oscillation width) and was indexed and integrated using HKL2000 (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). A three-wavelength SeMet MAD data set was collected from one crystal at APS beamline 19-BM using the inverse beam method and was indexed and integrated by HKL2000. A 3.0 Å mercury SAD data set was collected from one crystal at APS beamline 14-ID. The wavelength of peak absorption at the mercury LIII edge (1.0075 Å) was used to collect 360° of data as 0.5° oscillation images, which were indexed and integrated using MOSFLM (35Leslie A.G.W.

As the PdxS polypeptide contains 15 Met residues, 90 selenium sites were expected in the asymmetric unit. However, we were unable to solve the selenium substructure using several programs (SOLVE (37Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Kristallogr. 2002; 217: 686-693Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar)), presumably due to the poor quality of the data. We next turned to the mercury SAD data set and solved the mercury substructure with both SHELX and BnP. Six pairs of mercury sites were found in the asymmetric unit. The PdxS polypeptide has two Cys residues in the sequence Cys-Gly-Cys. Each cysteine residue bound one mercury atom. The six pairs of sites were consistent with the self-rotation function, which revealed 6-fold noncrystallographic symmetry perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. A 3 Å unaveraged map generated by the PHASES routine in BnP was interpretable. A Fourier map using Bijvoet differences from the SeMet-PdxS peak wavelength and mercury-SAD phases revealed most of the selenium sites, confirming the correctness of the phasing and also aiding chain tracing. The 6-fold redundancy was exploited to extend the experimental 3.0 Å SAD phases to 2.2 Å in the native data using RESOLVE (37Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). An 80%-complete model was auto-traced by ARP/wARP (42Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The model was refined with REFMAC5 (44Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Water sites were identified automatically by ARP_WATERS in the CCP4 suite, refined, and verified manually. Density corresponding to MPD was initially modeled as unknown atomic sites, which were refined without non-bonded contact restraints using the dummy-atom feature of REFMAC5. Models for both enantiomers of MPD were fit to the resulting five dummy-atomic sites. Refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The final model is available in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 1ZNN. Structure superpositions were performed with program O, sequence alignment was with CLUSTALX (45Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35495) Google Scholar), and molecular figures were prepared with PyMOL (46DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, South San Francisco, CA2002Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in an Optima XL-I ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). A double-sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpiece with sapphire windows and 1.2-mm pathlength was used. The reference sector was filled with 420 μl of dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, without or with sulfate or phosphate) and the sample sector with an equivalent volume of sample containing ∼1 mg/ml protein. Solvent densities and viscosities were calculated with SEDNTERP (47Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C.

Following thermal equilibration in the centrifuge at 20 °C for at least 1 h at 0 rpm, the velocity experiment was initiated by accelerating the rotor to 40,000 rpm. Boundary positions were determined using both the Rayleigh interference, and the absorbance (280 nm) optics with scans taken every 3-5 min. Data were processed with the programs SEDFIT 8.9 (48Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar) and SEDPHAT 3.0 (49Balbo A.

PdxS Fold—PdxS has a classic (β/α)8 barrel fold, consisting of eight parallel β-strands (β1-β8) alternating with eight α helices (α1-α8) along the polypeptide chain (Fig. 2a). The barrel architecture is decorated by two major insertions, which participate in subunit contacts (see below). The first insertion is a large helical protrusion from the side and bottom of the barrel, formed by helix α6′ (residues 179-189), helix α6″ (residues 193-202), and the C terminus (residues 166-176) of helix α6. The second insertion is a C-terminal helix (α8″; residues 261-268), which lies on the side of the barrel such that the polypeptide C terminus is unconventionally at the top of the barrel. Two smaller deviations from the prototypical barrel include a small 310 helix, which we name α8′ (residues 237-240), on the top of the barrel, and a short 310 helix (residues 117-121), which we name α4 by convention, in place of barrel helix α4. Based on the sequence alignment of PdxS and 90 homologs, all of these deviations from the canonical barrel architecture are conserved. Several residues are disordered and missing from the structure, including 33 from the top of the barrel (residues 46-55 in the β2-α2 loop; residues 272-294 at the C terminus) and 17 from the bottom (residues 1-17 preceding β1). PdxS Quaternary Structure—PdxS crystallized as an unusual dodecamer in which the subunits form a cylinder 90 Å tall and 110 Å in diameter (Fig. 2b). The cylinder walls are 35 Å thick, creating an internal space 40 Å in diameter. The dodecamer is constructed of two opposing hexameric rings. The solid waist of the cylinder is formed by interdigitation of the helical protrusions from the two hexamers. Each end of the cylinder is a ring of six (β/α)8 barrels. The top of each (β/α)8 barrel points inward and the bottom toward the outside of the cylinder. The barrel axis of each subunit does not point directly inward but is tipped 25° toward the nearest end of the cylinder. Subunits in the hexameric ring have extensive hydrophobic contacts that exclude water and bury 17% of the subunit surface. The helical insertion α8″ is part of this interface. A strictly conserved salt bridge from Asp220 to Arg83 and His86 of a neighboring subunit is buried in the otherwise hydrophobic interface. By criteria of interface size, hydrophobicity, packing, and conservation, the hexameric ring appears to be a feature of PdxS and its 90 closest relatives. In contrast to contacts within the hexamer, subunit contacts between hexameric rings are more polar, less conserved, and include buried solvent. Twelve sulfate ions, which may mimic more physiologically relevant phosphate ions, are bound at the interface of hexamers. Each sulfate ion forms salt bridges with three strictly conserved residues from a subunit in one hexamer (His115, Arg137, and Arg138) and conserved Lys187 from a subunit of the opposing hexamer.

Retinol saturase converts all-trans-retinol to all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol (Moise, A. R., Kuksa, V., Imanishi, Y., and Palczewski, K. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 50230-50242). Here we demonstrate that the enzymes involved in oxidation of retinol to retinoic acid and then to oxidized retinoic acid metabolites are also involved in the synthesis and oxidation of all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid. All-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid can activate retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor heterodimers but not retinoid X receptor homodimers in reporter cell assays. All-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid was detected in vivo in Lrat-/- mice supplemented with retinyl palmitate. Thus, all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoic acid is a naturally occurring retinoid and a potential ligand for nuclear receptors. This new metabolite can also be an intermediate in a retinol degradation pathway or it can serve as a precursor for the synthesis of bioactive 13,14-dihydroretinoid metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W2005310529,"Assembly of transmembrane (TM) domains is a critical step in the function of membrane proteins, and therefore, determining the amino acid motifs that mediate this process is important. Studies along this line have shown that the GXXXG motif is involved in TM assembly. In this study we characterized the minimal dimerization motif in the bacterial Tar-1 homodimer TM domain, which does not contain a GXXXG sequence. We found that a short polar motif QXXS is sufficient to induce stable TM-TM interactions. Statistical analysis revealed that this motif appears to be significantly over-represented in a bacterial TM data base compared with its theoretical expectancy, suggesting a general role for this motif in TM assembly. A truncated short TM peptide (9 residues) that contains the QXXS motif interacted slightly with the wild-type Tar-1. However, the same short TM peptide regained wild-type-like activity when conjugated to an octanoyl aliphatic moiety. Biophysical studies indicated that this modification compensated for the missing hydrophobicity, stabilized α-helical structure, and enabled insertion of the peptide into the membrane core. These findings serve as direct evidence that even a short peptide containing a minimal recognition motif is sufficient to inhibit the proper assembly of TM domains. Interestingly, electron microscopy revealed that above the critical micellar concentration, the TM lipopeptide forms a network of nanofibers, which can serve for the slow release of the active lipopeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2034470062,"Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C) is one of four members in the PDGF family of growth factors, which are known mitogens and survival factors for cells of mesenchymal origin. PDGF-C has a unique two-domain structure consisting of an N-terminal CUB and a conserved C-terminal growth factor domain that are separated by a hinge region. PDGF-C is secreted as a latent dimeric factor (PDGF-CC), which undergoes extracellular removal of the CUB domains to become a PDGF receptor α agonist. Recently, the multidomain serine protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a thrombolytic agent used for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, was shown to cleave and activate PDGF-CC. In this study we determine the molecular mechanism of tPA-mediated activation of PDGF-CC. Using various PDGF-CC and tPA mutants, we were able to demonstrate that both the CUB and the growth factor domains of PDGF-C, as well as the kringle-2 domain of tPA, are required for the interaction and cleavage to occur. We also show that Arg231 in PDGF-C is essential for tPA-mediated proteolysis and that the released “free” CUB domain of PDGF-C can act as a competitive inhibitor of the cleavage reaction. Furthermore, we studied how the PDGF-C/tPA axis is regulated in primary fibroblasts and found that PDGF-C expression is down-regulated by hypoxia but induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 treatment. Elucidating the regulation and the mechanism of tPA-mediated activation of PDGF-CC will advance our knowledge of the physiological function of PDGF-CC and tPA and may provide new therapeutic opportunities for thrombolytic and cardiovascular therapies.

The four PDGF chains assemble into five dimeric isoforms, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, PDGF-CC, and PDGF-DD, that exert their effects on cells through differential signaling via two known tyrosine kinase receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α and PDGFR-β (10Li X.

In order for the novel PDGFs to bind and activate the PDGFRs, the N-terminal CUB domains have to be removed through limited proteolysis by extracellular proteases. The origin of the protease involved in the activation of PDGF-DD still remains elusive, whereas the extracellular fibrinolytic protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been shown to be a potent activator of PDGF-CC (11Fredriksson L. Li H. Fieber C. Li X. Eriksson U. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3793-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).tPA is a highly specific serine protease that consists of five structural domains, a finger domain, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, two kringle domains, and a trypsin-like protease domain (12Collen D. Hematology (Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program). 2001; : 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is best known for its role in vascular fibrinolysis where it converts the zymogen plasminogen into plasmin, which in turn degrades the fibrin network in blood clots. The observation that tPA binds to fibrin via its finger and kringle-2 domains (13Verheijen J.H. Caspers M.P. Chang G.T. de Munk G.A. Pouwels P.H. Enger-Valk B.E.

In fact, tPA is currently used to treat acute myocardial infarction and is also approved for treatment of acute ischemic stroke (15rtPA Stroke Study Group N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1581-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (10021) Google Scholar). However, emerging evidence points at non-fibrinolytic functions of tPA, at least within the central nervous system, promoting events associated with synaptic plasticity and regulation of neurovascular permeability (16Qian Z.

Some of these studies claim the effect to be mediated by plasmin, whereas others show the effect to be independent of plasminogen activation (reviewed in Ref. 19Yepes M. Lawrence D.A. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At present there are only two non-plasminogen substrates reported for tPA, namely PDGF-CC and the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (11Fredriksson L. Li H. Fieber C. Li X. Eriksson U.

Clearly, it is of importance to determine the structural and regulatory requirements of PDGF-CC activation. Here, we describe the molecular mechanism of tPA-mediated cleavage of PDGF-CC. We demonstrate that both the CUB and the growth factor domains of PDGF-C and the kringle-2 domain of tPA are necessary for interaction of the two proteins and that Arg231 in the hinge region of PDGF-CC is needed for cleavage by tPA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—COS-1 cells and primary fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells were kept in supplemented F12 medium.

The PCR fragments of the PDGF-C and tPA truncation mutants, as well as the full-length tPA (tPAfl) lacking the signal sequence (used as control), were cloned in-frame with the signal sequence of the eukaryotic expression vector pSeqTag2B (Invitrogen). The tPA truncation mutants and tPAfl were then subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) accompanied by the Igκ-chain leader sequence and c-myc epitope, but excluding the His6 tag, from pSecTag2B. The amplified PDCUBPC and PCCUBPD fragments of the CUB regions (residues 1–172 of PDGF-D and 1–238 of PDGF-C, respectively) and the growth factor regions (residues 166–345 of PDGF-C and 261–370 of PDGF-D, respectively) were ligated and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vectors pSG5 (PDCUBPC) (22Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) or a modified pSeqTag2A (PCCUBPD; part of the multiple cloning site between SfiI and KpnI was removed by restriction; Invitrogen). The PCCUB PCR product (residues 1–165 of PDGF-C) was directionally cloned into pSG5. To generate the PDGF-C cleavage site mutants, primers were designed to enable PCR amplification of the entire vector template, human PDGF-C in pSG5 (1Li X. Pontén A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Bäckström G. Hellström M. Boström H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Östman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes). Point mutations and a HpaI site for in-frame cloning were included in the primer sequences. The 7.1-kb PCR products were cleaved and ligated. All primers used were purchased from Invitrogen, and all of the constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing.Table IConstruct nomenclature and description of primers used Open table in a new tab Transfection, Immunoblotting, and Receptor Activation—Subconfluent COS-1 cells were transfected with the various expression constructs using Lipofectamine Plus reagent in serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen). Transfection with empty vectors served as negative control (mock). After 4 h the transfection medium was replaced by supplemented DMEM overnight and thereafter by DMEM only. The conditioned serum-free medium was collected 48 h after transfection and used in receptor stimulation studies. Alternatively the proteins were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid as described previously (1Li X. Pontén A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Bäckström G. Hellström M. Boström H.

All precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, immunoblotted, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence plus reagent (ECL+, Amersham Biosciences). PDGF-C species and PCCUBPD were detected by immunoblotting using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies against PDGF-C (1Li X. Pontén A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Bäckström G. Hellström M. Boström H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Östman A. Eriksson U. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), respectively. tPA was detected using sheep polyclonal antibodies against human tPA (ab9030, Abcam) and tPA truncation mutants using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human c-myc (sc-789, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).To monitor growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β, serum-starved PAE cells stably expressing the respective human PDGFRs, were incubated for 90 min on ice with conditioned medium from transfected COS-1 cells. PAE cells treated with either conditioned medium from COS-1 cells transfected with empty vector (mock) or with recombinant PDGF-BB (100 ng/ml), or alternatively the recombinant growth factor domain of PDGF-CC (100 ng/ml), were used as controls. Following treatment the PAE cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl pH, 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 200 μm orthovanadate, and complete protease inhibitor mixture, and the PDGFRs were immunoprecipitated using specific antisera (23Eriksson A. Siegbahn A. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Precipitated receptors were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound antibodies were visualized as above.Protein-Protein Interaction Studies—To determine which domain(s) of tPA and PDGF-CC are involved in the protein-protein interaction between the two proteins, His6-tagged recombinant PDGF-CC protein species, expressed using the baculovirus expression system as described previously (1Li X. Pontén A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Bäckström G. Hellström M. Boström H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Östman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), were bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose (Qiagen) and then incubated for 90 min at room temperature with conditioned serum-free media from COS-1 cells transfected with the tPA truncation mutants. Uncoated Ni-NTA beads were used as negative control. The beads were thoroughly washed, and the His6-tagged PDGF-CC species were specifically eluted with 400 mm imidazole (Sigma). Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human c-myc (see above) to detect co-eluted tPA truncation species. The membranes were subsequently stripped and reprobed with PDGF-C-specific antibodies to detect input of full-length and core PDGF-C species or an anti-His monoclonal antibody (C-terminal, Invitrogen) to detect input of CUB protein. Bound antibodies were detected as described above.Chromogenic Assay—To confirm functional protease activity among the tPA truncation mutants, a chromogenic assay was developed. Conditioned serum-free media from COS-1 cells transfected with the tPA truncation constructs were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using NAP-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) to enable buffer exchange to Tris-buffered saline. The protease activity analysis was performed in flat-bottomed microplates with 0.2 mm Spectrozyme tPA (American Diagnostica) as a chromogenic substrate for tPA. The formation of paranitroanilide (pNA), i.e. the amount of cleaved substrate, was measured photometrically at 405 nm. Comparable product amounts suggest functional protease activity. Buffer-exchanged conditioned media from mock-transfected cells were used as negative control. Purified human tPA was used to define maximal activity (T7776, Sigma).Regulation of PDGF-C, tPA, and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor (PAI)-1 Expression—To determine how PDGF-C, tPA, and its inhibitor PAI-1 are regulated by various growth factors and metabolic conditions, primary kidney fibroblasts were plated at subconfluence in 6-well plates. Following attachment, the medium was exchanged for serum-free DMEM in the absence or presence of TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 (5 ng/ml, R&D Systems), or high glucose (30 mm); alternatively the cells were placed in hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen). After 24 h the conditioned serum-free media were collected, and the proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. PDGF-C and tPA were detected using specific antibodies (see above), and PAI-1 was detected using a rabbit anti-PAI antibody (sc-8979, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).RESULTStPA-mediated Proteolysis Depends on Both Structural Domains of PDGF-CC—We mapped the structural requirements for recognition of latent PDGF-CC as a substrate for tPA using mutated forms of PDGF-CC in a co-transfection assay. The mutants of PDGF-CC included chimeric forms of PDGF-C, one carrying the CUB domain of PDGF-D and the hinge region and growth factor domain of PDGF-C (PDCUBPC) and the other one carrying the CUB domain and the hinge region of PDGF-C and the growth factor domain of PDGF-D (PCCUBPD) (schematically illustrated in Fig. 1A). In addition, a truncation mutant lacking the CUB domain of PDGF-C was also employed (PCΔ150). All mutants were properly expressed in transfected COS-1 cells, formed disulfide-linked dimers (data not shown), and were efficiently secreted in the conditioned medium (Fig. 1B). When co-transfected with tPA, the generation of a 22-kDa protected fragment from PDCUBPC was significantly reduced as compared with wild-type PDGF-CC (PCWT), whereas no cleavage product was detected in co-transfections with PCCUBPD or with PCΔ150 (Fig. 1B).Fig. 1Cleavage of PDGF-CC by tPA is dependent on both the CUB and the growth factor domains. A, schematic illustration of the mutant proteins used to determine the structural requirements of PDGF-CC for proteolysis by tPA. B, COS-1 cells were transfected with the corresponding expression constructs in the absence or presence of tPA. 48 h after transfection serum-free conditioned media were collected and proteins trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. The precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the PDGF species were detected by immunoblotting using specific polyclonal antibodies. Co-expression of PCWT and, to a lesser extent, PDCUBPC with tPA generated a 22-kDa fragment (arrow). tPA expression was monitored using a polyclonal antibody against tPA (lower panel). C, similar results were obtained when conditioned serum-free media from transfected COS-1 cells were used to study induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of either PDGFR-α (R-α, upper panel) or PDGFR-β (R-β, lower panel) expressed in PAE cells. PAE cells were stimulated with the conditioned media on ice and lysed, and then the PDGFRs were immunoprecipitated (IP) using specific antibodies. Phosphorylated receptors were detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Recombinant PDGF-BB (100 ng/ml) was used as positive control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results were verified in receptor stimulation experiments where conditioned media from transfected COS-1 cells were applied onto PAE cells with stable expression of PDGFR-α (upper panel) or PDGFR-β (lower panel), respectively (Fig. 1C). Following immunoprecipitation of the respective receptors, stimulation was measured as induction of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown previously, media from COS-1 cells co-expressing tPA and wild-type PDGF-CC induced strong PDGFR-α activation comparable with PDGF-BB-stimulated controls (11Fredriksson L. Li H. Fieber C. Li X. Eriksson U. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3793-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas media from COS-1 cells co-expressing tPA with PDCUBPC induced weaker PDGFR-α activation. Cells stimulated with conditioned media expressing the PDGF-CC mutants alone or co-expressing tPA with PCCUBPD or the truncation mutant PCΔ150, respectively, showed only background levels of PDGFR-α activation. As cleavage of PCCUBPD would release the growth factor domain of PDGF-DD, a PDGFR-β agonist, the conditioned media were also applied to PDGFR-β expressing PAE cells, but none induced PDGFR-β stimulation. These findings indicate that both the CUB and the growth factor domains are necessary for efficient proteolytic cleavage of latent PDGF-CC by tPA.The Majority of the Hinge Region Is Removed in Active PDGF-CC—The finding that the truncation mutant PCΔ150 failed to induce PDGFR-α activation indicates that not only the CUB domain but also parts of the hinge region have to be removed for receptor activation. To understand the structural requirements of PDGF-CC for receptor binding and activation, a series of truncated mutants of PDGF-C, lacking the CUB domain and increasing portions of the hinge region, was developed (schematically illustrated in Fig. 2A). All mutants formed disulfide-linked dimers (data not shown) and were efficiently secreted in the conditioned medium by transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 2B). The multiple species of the truncated mutants seen in the immunoblots are possibly due to exposure and subsequent glycosylation of the putative N-glycosylation site present in the growth factor domain of PDGF-C (1Li X. Pontén A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Bäckström G. Hellström M. Boström H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Östman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be ruled out that removal of the CUB domain leaves the otherwise protected hinge region vulnerable for degradation.Fig. 2The majority of the hinge region has to be removed for PDGF-CC to be a PDGFR-α agonist. A, illustration of the N-terminally truncated variants of PDGF-CC used to determine the structural requirements for PDGFR-α stimulation. B, immunoblot analysis of the truncation mutants in conditioned serum-free medium collected from transfected COS-1 cells. Equivalent expression of the PDGF-C species was detected using specific polyclonal antibodies. C, induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-α expressed in PAE cells. Conditioned serum-free media from transfected COS-1 cells were applied to the PAE cells, and the PDGFR-α (R-α) was immunoprecipitated (IP). Only the two shortest mutants induced efficient phosphorylation comparable with the positive control recombinant PDGF-CC (100 ng/ml, growth factor domain of PDGF-CC).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The truncation mutants were analyzed for their ability to activate PDGFR-α in PAE cells. Conditioned media containing equal amounts of the truncated mutant proteins of PDGF-CC (determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were applied onto PAE cells, and the activation of PDGFR-α was monitored by induction of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). The results showed that the two shortest mutants, PCΔ210 and PCΔ230, efficiently activated PDGFR-α, whereas mutants with additional parts of the hinge region, separating the CUB and the growth factor domains in PDGF-C, failed to do so. Thus, in order for PDGF-CC to be a receptor agonist, both the CUB domain and the majority of the hinge region have to be removed from the growth factor, allowing at most the last 40 amino acids of the hinge region to remain, indicating that the cleavage site resides in this region.Arg231 in the Hinge Region of PDGF-CC Is Essential for tPA-mediated Cleavage—Within this stretch of amino acids we have previously identified a putative tribasic processing site (amino acid residues -Arg231-Lys232-Ser233-Arg234- in human PDGF-C) based on comparison with the well known processing sites in PDGF-A and PDGF-B (1Li X. Pontén A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Bäckström G. Hellström M. Boström H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Östman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Recently we reported tPA to cleave mouse PDGF-CC in, or at least around, this conserved site (11Fredriksson L. Li H. Fieber C. Li X. Eriksson U. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3793-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To better characterize which of the three basic amino acids, Arg231, Lys232, and Arg234, is important for cleavage to occur, the amino acids were individually mutated to alanine residues. The expression constructs encoding these PDGF-C mutants were separately co-transfected with tPA. The extent of PDGF-CC cleavage was monitored by immunoblotting as the presence of the 22-kDa band (Fig. 3A) and induction of PDGFR-"

Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a key role in the expression of a variety of genes in response to infection, inflammation, and stressful conditions. We found that the POZ domain of FBI-1 (factor that binds to the inducer of short transcripts of human immunodeficiency virus-1) interacted with the Rel homology domain of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in both in vivo and in vitro protein-protein interaction assays. FBI-1 enhanced NF-κB-mediated transcription of E-selectin genes in HeLa cells upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation and overcame gene repression by IκBα or IκBβ. In contrast, the POZ domain of FBI-1, which is a dominant-negative form of FBI-1, repressed NF-κB-mediated transcription, and the repression was cooperative with IκBα or IκBβ. In contrast, the POZ domain tagged with a nuclear localization sequence polypeptide of FBI-1 enhanced NF-κB-responsive gene transcription, suggesting that the molecular interaction between the POZ domain and the Rel homology domain of p65 and the nuclear localization by the nuclear localization sequence are important in the transcription enhancement mediated by FBI-1. Confocal microscopy showed that FBI-1 increased NF-κB movement into the nucleus and increased the stability of NF-κB in the nucleus, which enhanced NF-κB-mediated transcription of the E-selectin gene.

The BTB/POZ (broad complex, Tramtrack, and bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger) domain is an evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interaction domain that is found at the N terminus of various cellular and viral regulatory proteins. The proteins containing the BTB/POZ domain have several C-terminal structures important in their biological functions, such as the zinc finger, actin-binding repeats, and ion channel motifs (1Albagli O.

NF-κB exists in the cytoplasm of most cell types as the homo- or heterodimer of structurally related proteins called the Rel or Rel/NF-κB proteins. It appears that various Rel/NF-κB complexes have different NF-κB binding site specificities and that the extent of transcription induced by individual subunit combinations is, in part, dependent upon the nature of binding sites that they recognize. The Rel/NF-κB proteins contain a highly conserved N-terminal 300-amino acid region called the Rel homology domain (RHD). The RHD contains important domains for DNA binding, dimerization, the nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and interaction with IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB) family members (12May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin.

These proteins not only specifically and reversibly inhibit DNA binding by NF-κB, but also actively dissociate DNA-bound NF-κB in vitro and export back to the cytoplasm (19Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

The interactions increase the localization and stability of the p65 subunit in the nucleus, resulting in the transcription enhancement of an NF-κB-responsive target gene such as E-selectin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Antibodies, and Reagents—Mammalian expression vectors for the human p65 subunit, IκBα, IκBβ, and NF-κB reporter plasmids were kind gifts from Drs. T. H. Lee and K. C. Jung (Yonsei University). The overexpression plasmids for the p65 subunit of NF-κB, IκBα, and IκBβ are under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, and the pELAM-Luc plasmid was described previously (24Brown K.

For bacterial overexpression, His6-RHD and GST-POZ cDNAs were cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen Inc.) and pGEX4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) expression vectors. All plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing.Anti-His6 antibody was purchased from Qiagen Inc.

The POZ domain of FBI-1 was cloned into a pLexA-DB vector and used as bait. The PCR-amplified POZ domain of FBI-1 was cloned into the pLexA vector. The pLexA-POZFBI-1 plasmid was introduced into yeast strain EGY48(p8op-lacZ) by a standard protocol, and yeast containing pLexA-POZFBI-1 was selected on synthetic dextrose/-Ura/-His plates. Transformed yeast containing pLexA-POZFBI-1 was prepared as competent yeast by a standard protocol. An amplified human liver Matchmaker® yeast LexA cDNA library was transformed into competent pLexA-POZFBI-1-containing yeast and screened on synthetic dextrose/-Ura/-His/-Trp plates. At 5 days post-transformation, 153 well grown colonies were selected and stored. The cotransformants of the 153 colonies were screened on synthetic dextrose/Gal/Raf/-Ura/-His/-Trp/-Leu + X-gal to identify the protein-protein interactions. After nutrition and X-gal double selection, 37 colonies were isolated. The plasmids in the yeast were isolated by miniscale preparation and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. The amplified plasmids from E. coli were purified, restriction enzyme-digested for mapping, and sequenced.Molecular Interaction between IκBα or IκBβ and the POZ Domain of FBI-1 in Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The POZ domain of FBI-1 was cloned into the pLexA-DB vector to prepare pLexA-POZFBI-1 and used as bait. The pLexA-POZFBI-1 plasmid was introduced into yeast strain EGY48(p8op-lacZ) by a standard protocol, and yeast containing pLexA-POZFBI-1 was selected on synthetic dextrose/-Ura/-His plates. Transformed yeast containing pLexA-POZFBI-1 was prepared as competent yeast by a standard protocol. To prepare the fish protein pB42AD-IκBβ plasmid, the coding sequence of IκBβ was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pB42AD vector in-frame with the B42 activation domain. Yeast cotransformants of two plasmids (pLexA-POZFBI-1 and pB42AD-IκBβ) were streaked onto synthetic dextrose/Gal/Raf/-Ura/-His/-Trp + X-gal, and the in vivo protein-protein interactions were identified by blue colony formation.Bacterial Overexpression of Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—For bacterial overexpression of fusion proteins, the pTrcHisB-RHD (the RHD of the p65 subunit of NF-κB) and pGEX4T3-POZFBI-1 plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH5α. Bacteria were grown in 500 ml of LB broth to A600 = 0.8 at 37 °C and induced overnight with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 18 °C. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and lysed in cold E. coli binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm imidazole, and one tablet/50 ml protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Soluble fractions from the lysate were incubated with 2 ml of GSH-agarose (for GST-POZ) or 500 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (for His6-RHD; Qiagen Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, bound proteins were eluted with 2 ml of elution buffer (for GST-POZ, 10 mm GSH and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); and for His6-RHD, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 100 or 250 mm imidazole) and dialyzed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at 4 °C.For the in vitro protein-protein interaction assay, 9 μg of purified GST-POZ and GST were bound to GSH-agarose for 1 h in 500 μl of TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and one tablet/50 ml protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C. Agarose-bound GST or GST fusion protein was collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and washed four times with cold TNE buffer. Agarose-bound GST protein was incubated with His6-RHD in TNE buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. After the agarose-protein complex was washed three times with cold TNE buffer, the bound proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Xpress tag antibody.Recombinant GST-IκBα, GST-IκBβ, and His6-POZ proteins were prepared as described above using the pGEX4T3-IκBα, pGEX4T3-IκBβ, and pQE30-His-POZ expression plasmids, respectively. For the in vitro protein-protein interaction assay, 9 μg of purified GST-IκBα or GST-IκBβ and GST were bound to GSH-agarose for 1 h in 500 μl of TNE buffer at 4 °C. Agarose-bound GST or GST fusion protein was collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and washed four times with cold TNE buffer. Agarose-bound GST protein was incubated with His6-POZ in TNE buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. After the agarose-protein complex was washed three times with cold TNE buffer, the bound proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-His tag antibody.Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the transient transfection study, HeLa cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and grown for 24 h before transfection with a total of 1 μg of DNA (0.6 μg of pELAM-Luc, 0.2 μg of FBI-1 or POZ domain expression plasmid, and 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-gal) using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and TNFα (20 ng/ml) or PMA (250 ng/ml) was introduced 4 h before harvesting the cells. Cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer, and luciferase activities were measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity.To investigate whether the POZ domain of FBI-1 is sufficient to affect the cellular localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and to activate transcription of the E-selectin promoter, HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 1.2 μg of DNA (0.2 μg of pELAM-Luc, 0.4 μg of POZ or POZNLS domain expression plasmid, 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-gal, and the appropriate amount of pcDNA3.0 to make a total of 1.2 μg of DNA) using Lipofectamine Plus reagent as described above.Immunostaining—For immunostaining, PMA-stimulated or non-stimulated HeLa cells were grown on coverslips (Sunshine Works, Seoul, Korea), washed with cold PBS, and fixed in 99:3 cold methanol/formaldehyde for 20 min at -20 °C. Cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature and then washed three times for 10 min each with PBS. Cells were incubated in 5% normal goat serum (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking, the cells were incubated in a wet chamber with rabbit anti-POZ domain primary antibody (diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml) in an incubation solution of 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then rinsed three times for 10 min each with the incubation solution and further incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (diluted to 5 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. For double staining, after the cells were washed with PBS, they were incubated with 3.7% formaldehyde. The cells were then incubated with different antibodies (anti-p65 subunit primary antibody (diluted to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml) and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody) and washed three times for 10 min at room temperature, with the final wash containing 1 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were mounted onto slide glasses with mounting medium (90% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine, and 0.02% sodium azide) and examined with a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—One microgram of anti-p65 subunit polyclonal antibody, anti-IκBα or anti-IκBβ antibody, or control anti-IgG antibody was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 mg of cell extract prepared using lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm glycerophosphate, 0.1 g/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Forty microliters of a 1:1 suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the cell lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with cell lysis buffer. Bound proteins were dissociated by boiling the samples in 1× PAGE sample buffer (12 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 0.4% SDS, 2.88 mm mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). The whole cell lysates were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk containing anti-POZ domain antibody. The membrane was washed several times with TBST buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. After 1 h, the blot was washed several times with TBST buffer and developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSFBI-1 Interacts with the p65 Subunit of NF-κB—We screened a human liver Matchmaker® yeast LexA two-hybrid cDNA library using the LexA-POZ domain fusion protein as bait. We isolated the p65 subunit of NF-κB as one of the potential proteins interacting with the POZ domain. Accordingly, we investigated whether FBI-1 can interact with NF-κB by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro GST fusion protein pull-down assay. We transiently transfected HeLa cells with either the pcDNA3.0-FBI-1 overexpression plasmid or the mock expression plasmid (pcDNA3.0). We immunoprecipitated cell extracts with anti-p65 subunit antibody, and precipitants were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FBI-1 antibody. p65 interacted with FBI-1, and overexpression of FBI-1 led to a stronger FBI-1 band at 75-80 kDa (Fig. 1A).To investigate whether the protein-protein interaction between the POZ domain of FBI-1 and p65 is direct, we performed an in vitro GST fusion protein pull-down assay. Recombinant GST or GST-POZ was allowed to interact with His6-RHD-Xpress, pulled down, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Xpress tag antibody. Our data show that the POZ domain of FBI-1 and the RHD of the p65 subunit interacted directly (Fig. 1B).FBI-1 Enhances NF-κB-mediated Transcription of the E-selectin Promoter in HeLa Cells Stimulated with Either TNFα or PMA, and the POZ Domain of FBI-1 Represses Transcription— The molecular interaction between FBI-1 and the p65 subunit of NF-κB suggests that FBI-1 may play a role in NF-κB-mediated transcription activation. To investigate this possibility, we tested the effect of overexpression of FBI-1 and the POZ domain (the FBI-1 functional domain interacting with NF-κB) on NF-κB-mediated transcription using a luciferase reporter assay. After 44 h of cotransfection of HeLa cells with the NF-κB-responsive E-selectin promoter-luciferase reporter gene fusion plasmid (Fig. 2A) (30Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the FBI-1 or POZ domain expression plasmid, cells were stimulated with either TNFα or PMA for 4 h and harvested. In mock-transfected cells, reporter activity was increased by 6-10-fold due to the movement of NF-κB by the stimulants, as reported by others (40). Interestingly, full-length FBI-1 further enhanced transcription by 1.7-2-fold compared with the stimulated control (Fig. 2, B and C, bars 2 and 3). We overexpressed the POZ domain of FBI-1, which lacks the NLS and which is located only in the cytoplasm, and found that the domain repressed transcription by >70% compared with the control mock-transfected cells treated with TNFα or PMA (Fig. 2, B and C, bars 4).Fig. 2FBI-1 enhances and the POZ domain represses NF-κB-mediated E-selectin gene expression in HeLa cells stimulated with either TNFα or PMA.A, shown is the structure of the NF-κB-responsive E-selectin gene promoter-luciferase gene fusion construct (pELAM-Luc). Three copies of the NF-κB-responsive elements located at bp -135 to -75 are indicated by ovals. Tsp, transcription start point (position +1). B, HeLa cells were transfected with the pELAM-1-Luc reporter plasmid and with an expression plasmid for the POZ domain (POZFBI-1) or full-length FBI-1. After 24 h, cells were treated with TNFα for 4 h. FBI-1 enhanced transcription, and the POZ domain repressed transcription. C, HeLa cells were treated as described for B, but the cells were treated with PMA. The results were the same as those shown in B. D, FBI-1 enhanced transcription, but other POZ domain proteins either repressed or had no effect on transcription of the pELAM E-selectin promoter. HeLa cells were cotransfected with the"
https://openalex.org/W2160274984,"Budding and fission yeast Cdc14 homologues, a conserved family of serine-threonine phosphatases, play a role in the inactivation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) by molecularly distinct mechanisms. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc14 protein phosphatase inactivates CDKs by promoting mitotic cyclin degradation and the accumulation of a CDK inhibitor to allow budding yeast cells to exit from mitosis. Schizosaccharomyces pombe Flp1 phosphatase down-regulates CDK/cyclin activity, controlling the degradation of the Cdc25 tyrosine phosphatase for fission yeast cells to undergo cytokinesis. In the present work, we show that human Cdc14 homologues (hCdc14A and hCdc14B) rescued flp1-deficient fission yeast strains, indicating functional homology. We also show that hCdc14A and B interacted in vivo with S. pombe Cdc25 and that hCdc14A dephosphorylated this mitotic inducer both in vitro and in vivo. Our results support a Cdc14 conserved inhibitory mechanism acting on S. pombe Cdc25 protein and suggest that human cells may regulate Cdc25 in a similar manner to inactivate Cdk1-mitotic cyclin complexes."

The importance of the HIV gp41 loop region to envelope function has been systematically examined by alanine scanning of all gp41 loop residues and the subsequent characterization of the mutagenic effects on viral entry, envelope expression, envelope processing, and gp120 association with gp41. With respect to the wild-type gp41, mutational effects on viral entry fall into four classes as follows: 1) little or no effect (G594A, S599A, G600A, K601A, N611A, S615A, N616A, and L619A); 2) significantly reduced entry (I595A, L602A, I603A, V608A, and K617A); 3) abolished entry (L593A, W596A, G597A, T606A, W610A, W614A, S618A, and I622A); and 4) enhanced entry (T605A, P609A, S613A, E620A, and Q621A). The reduced functionality of many mutants was apparently due to either disruption of envelope processing (L593A and T606A), viral incorporation of the envelope (W610A, W614A, and I662A), or increased dissociation of gp120 (W596A, G597A, and S618A). The extreme sensitivity of the gp120-gp41 interaction to alanine substitutions (e.g. the G597A and S618A mutants are relatively conservative substitutions) suggests that this association is an attractive and novel target for future drug discovery efforts.

In contrast, the NMR structure of the SIV gp41 ectodomain includes the central loop (8Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A. Clore G. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). At present, there is no structural information available for the gp120-gp41 complex; however, based on previous mutagenesis studies, the central loop of gp41 is one site of non-covalent interactions with gp120 that are critical to HIV entry (13Cao J. Bergeron L. Helseth E. Thali M. Repke H. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Merat R. Raoul H. Leste-Lasserre T. Sonigo P. Pancino G. J.

Nunberg J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4921-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other regions of gp41, such as the N-helix, have also been implicated in forming a direct interaction with gp120 (18Park E. Quinnan G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5707-5713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we present the first systematic mutation study of the importance of each gp41 loop residue to gp41 function with the long-term goal of identifying gp41 regions that are attractive sites for drug intervention.MATERIALS AND METHODSMutants were prepared from plasmid pHXB2 (19Page K. Landau N. Littman D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5270-5276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Stratagene QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit with subsequent verification by DNA sequencing. The functionality of gp41 mutants was determined in a luciferase-based entry assay (20Connor R. Chen B. Choe S. Landau N. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). For this assay, plasmids pHXB2 (bearing wild-type or mutant gp41) and pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-(20Connor R. Chen B. Choe S. Landau N. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) were co-transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation into 293T cells, which were maintained in Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the medium was harvested and filtered through a 0.45-micron filter to make the virus stock. For an assay of viral entry, U87/CD4/CXCR4 cells (3Clapham P. McKnight A. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1809-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which were maintained in Dulbecco's medium with 15% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 1 mg/ml puromycin, 300 μg/ml G418, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well to a 12-well cell culture plate in a volume of 1 ml. The following day, 500 μl of the virus stock was added to each of the wells of the U87 cells after removal of the medium. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After ∼16 h, the virus was aspirated and replaced with U87 medium, and the cells were allowed to rest for another 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system from Promega and a Berthold FB12 luminometer running Sirius software. The experiments were run in triplicate from transfection to assay of luciferase activity and, thus, the uncertainties represent all parts of the experiment. For Western blot analysis, the 293T cell lysates were collected using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS). The virus pellet was prepared by ultracentrifugation on a cushion of 20% sucrose at 55,000 rpm for 1 h using a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. The pellets were re-suspended in the lysis buffer described above. Cell lysates and virus pellets were normalized for total protein concentration using the Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce) and p24 expression by Western analysis. After electrophoresis, transfer, and blocking (washing with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and subsequent blocking with TBST plus 5% dry milk for gp41 and SuperBlock (Pierce) for gp120), the blots were probed with either goat anti-HIV-1 gp120 polyclonal antibody (United States Biological) or mouse anti-HIV-1 gp41 monoclonal antibody (Chessie 8; National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). The secondary antibody used was peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure rabbit anti-goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) or anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Bio-Rad).RESULTSDesign of gp41 Loop Mutants—Based on the NMR structure of the SIV gp41 ectodomain (8Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A. Clore G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Covell D. Gronenborn A. Clore G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), the HIV-1 loop is expected to consist of 30 residues (amino acids 593 to 622 of HXB2 HIV-1), which are shown in Fig. 1. With respect to the gp41 of HIV-2 and SIV, there is a four-residue insertion in the HIV-1 gp41 loop (amino acid sequence ASWS). Discounting the insertion, 12 of the remaining 26 residues are conserved between HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV to give 46% sequence identity. In the present study, 26 alanine substitutions of the HIV-1 gp41 loop region were generated (Fig. 1). The conserved cysteines at positions 598 and 604 were not substituted, because a previous study suggested that single-site mutations result in improperly processed protein (21Dedra D. Gu R. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1207-1209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Viral Entry of gp41 Loop Mutants—The effects of the gp41 mutations on viral entry were first assayed by a luciferase-based assay in which viral entry is proportional to the observed luciferase activity (20Connor R. Chen B. Choe S. Landau N. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table I, the effects of the mutations range from the near complete abolishment of viral entry (e.g. L593A) to significant enhancement of viral entry (e.g. T605A). The mutants can be divided into the following four categories: 1) no effect with respect to virus expressing wild-type gp41 (defined as 40-160% of wild-type entry); 2) decreased viral entry (defined as 2-10% of wild-type entry); 3) abolished viral entry (defined as <2% of wild-type entry); and 4) enhancement of viral entry (defined as >200% of wild-type entry). Category 1 mutants, which exhibit minimal effects on viral entry, include G594A, S599A, G600A, K601A, N611A, S615A, N616A, and L619A. In general, this class of residues is not conserved among the three viral families (Fig. 1). Exceptions are Asn-616 and Leu-619, for which the alanine substitutions exhibit little effect on viral entry despite conservation in HIV-2 and SIV gp41 (Fig. 1). The results for the mutations of the glycosylation sites, Asn-611 and Asn-616, contradict a previous study, which reported that mutations at these sites significantly reduced viral infectivity (23Dedera D. Gu R. Ratner L. Virology. 1992; 187: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The present result is consistent, however, with a more recent study demonstrating that the entire glycan cluster (Asn-611, Asn-616, and Asn-637) must be removed in order to have a deleterious effect on function (24Johnson W. Sauvron J. Desrosiers R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11426-11436Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). With the exceptions of Lys-601 and Leu-619 within this category, substitution by alanine results in a relatively innocuous change in the nature of the amino acid side chain, and, thus, the absence of large effects on viral entry may not be surprising. Category 2 mutants, which have a significant effect on viral entry but do not abolish it, include I595A, L602A, I603A, V608A, and K617A. In all four cases, substitution by alanine results in a relatively radical change in the nature of the amino acid side chain and, thus, significant effects may be expected. On the other hand, Val-608 is the only member of this group that is conserved among the three viral families (Fig. 1). Category 3 mutants, which essentially abolish viral entry, include L593A, W596A, G597A, T606A, W610A, W614A, S618A, and I622A. Of this group, the majority (Leu-593, Trp-596, Gly-597, Thr-606, Trp-610, and Ser-618) are conserved between the gp41s of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV (Fig. 1). Of this subcategory, many of the alanine substitutions are relatively conservative in nature (e.g. G597A, T606A, and S618A). The exceptions include Trp-614 and Ile-622, which are not conserved among the three viral families; however, the alanine substitution is relatively radical in nature. Interestingly, Trp-614 occurs within the four-residue insertion of HIV-1 gp41 with respect to HIV-2 and SIV (Fig. 1), which suggests that this region plays a critical role in HIV-1 gp41 function. Category 4 mutants, which apparently enhance viral entry, include T605A, P609A, S613A, E620A, and Q621A. Of this group, only Pro-609 is conserved with HIV-2 and SIV gp41s. Ser-613 occurs in the inserted region, which again underlines the importance of this region to HIV-1 gp41 function.Fig. 2Luciferase reporter assay for viral entry.

Open table in a new tab Mutant Expression, Processing, and Association with gp120—The effects of gp41 mutations on viral entry could be due to a number of factors. For example, the mutations could have deleterious effects on viral entry by the following actions: (i) decreasing the amount of gp41 present because of reduced envelope expression or stability; (ii) decreasing the amount of gp41 present because of inefficient processing of the precursor gp160; (iii) decreasing the amount of gp41 present because of reduced incorporation into the virus; (iv) decreasing the affinity of the interaction between gp41 and gp120, thereby resulting in dissociation (or “shedding”) of gp120 into the media; or (v) the formation of a gp41-gp120 complex that cannot support the attachment or fusion steps of viral entry. On the other hand, mutational enhancement of viral entry could be due to the following: (i) increased envelope expression, stability, or incorporation resulting in increased concentration of envelope proteins at the virus surface; (ii) enhancement of the gp120-mediated viral attachment step; or (iii) enhancement of the gp41-mediated membrane fusion step. Many of these scenarios can be distinguished by a Western blot analysis of the envelope present in cell lysates or virus. For example, the presence of gp160 in cell lysates reflects expression, the presence of gp41 in cell lysates demonstrates processing, the presence of gp41 in virus demonstrates incorporation into the viral particle, and the presence of gp120 in cell lysates and the virus indicates that gp120 is associated with gp41 and is not shed into the media. In Fig. 3, a Western blot analysis of the wild-type and mutant envelope proteins present in cell lysates is presented. In addition, we have probed for the presence of gp41 and gp120 in virus to corroborate the results of the cell lysates and to establish incorporation of gp41 and gp120 into the virus. A summary of the two assays is presented in Table I. In the case of the wild-type, the cell lysates exhibit all three envelope species, and, thus, the envelope is expressed and processed, and gp120 remains associated with gp41, as expected. The category 1 mutants (G594A, S599A, G600A, K601A, N611A, S615A, N616A, and L619A), which are those that exhibit minimal effects on viral entry, exhibit a pattern of envelope proteins that is similar to that of the wild-type, as would be expected. In the case of the category 2 mutants (I595A, L602A, I603A, V608A, and K617A), which are those mutants that exhibit a significant deleterious effect on viral entry but do not abolish it, a variety of causes is implicated by the Western blot analyses. For example, I595A and I603A exhibit gp41 in the cell lysates, but the low levels of gp41 in the virus suggests that gp41 has been inefficiently incorporated into the virus. Low levels of gp41 and gp120 are observed in both cell lysates and the virus of V608A, indicating that the mutation has partially disrupted envelope processing and perhaps gp120 association with gp41. On the other hand, gp41 is observed in both cell lysates and the virus of K617A, but gp120 is reduced, suggesting that shedding of gp120 may be significant. Interestingly, L602A exhibits wild-type-like levels of gp41 and gp120 and, thus, its lower functionality is apparently due to either perturbation of the gp120-mediated attachment step or perturbation of the gp41-mediated membrane fusion step. In the case of the category 3 mutants (L593A, W596A, G597A, T606A, W610A, W614A, S618A, and I622A), the observed functionalities are apparently due to a variety of causes. For example, the low levels of gp41 in the cell lysates and viruses of L593A, T606A, W610A, W614A, and I622A suggest that these mutants are not efficiently processed. On the other hand, W596A, G597A, and S618A exhibit the presence of gp41 in cell lysates and viruses but significantly reduced levels of gp120, which suggests that these mutations cause shedding of gp120. Interestingly, S618A would be expected to abolish the glycosylation of Asn-616. Indeed, the S618A gp41 exhibits a lower molecular weight in Fig. 3, which is consistent with this notion. In light of the observations for N616A, which would also abolish the glycosylation of residue 616 but exhibits little effect on viral entry, the reduced functionality of S618A most likely arises from a direct interaction between Ser-618 and gp120 and not from the absence of glycosylation at Asn-616. Finally, in the case of the category 4 mutants (T605A, P609A, S613A, E620A, and Q621A), which are those that enhance viral entry, all of these mutants exhibit a similar pattern as the wild-type in cell lysates and viruses and, thus, they are expected to act by enhancing the viral attachment and/or membrane fusion steps.Fig. 3Western blot analysis of envelope expression, processing and gp120 association for HIV wild-type (wt) and the alanine mutants in cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONPrevious Studies of gp41 Loop Mutants—As discussed in the Introduction, a number of previous studies have characterized the effects of single-site mutations in the HIV gp41 loop, and, thus, it is of interest to compare the conclusions of these studies in light of the present work. In Table II, we have summarized our results along with those from two previous studies that characterized some similar gp41 loop mutations in a similar manner (16Maerz A. Drummer H. Wilson K. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17York J. Nunberg J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4921-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In general, the membrane fusion properties are in agreement with the exception of I595A, which exhibited significant effects to viral entry in our assay in contrast to a previous report (17York J. Nunberg J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4921-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Note that in both studies the I595A mutation did not appear to result in significant dissociation of gp120 (Table II). Differences in mutational effects can be attributed to different assays of envelope function (e.g. cell-cell fusion versus viral entry). In the case of mutations to Lys-601, all previous studies suggest little impairment of function and little effect to gp120 association, a result that is in agreement with our characterization of K601A (Table II). Moreover, Cao et al. (13Cao J. Bergeron L. Helseth E. Thali M. Repke H. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed that V608S abolished syncytia formation due to a lack of gp120 association with gp41, a result that is similar to our results for V608A. Previous mutations to Trp-596 and Gly-597 suggested that the mutations impaired function due to dissociation of gp120, which is in agreement with the results presented herein (Table II). An exception is the relatively conservative mutation W596F, which exhibited reduced function in the absence of gp120 dissociation. In another study, Cao et al. have characterized mutant W596M, which similarly exhibited decreased function in the absence gp120 dissociation (13Cao J. Bergeron L. Helseth E. Thali M. Repke H. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2747-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, previous studies of mutations to Leu-593, Thr-606, Trp-610, and Trp-614 suggested that the impaired function of mutations was due to the dissociation of gp120 from gp41, as evidenced by the presence of gp41 and the absence of gp120 in cell lysates (16Maerz A. Drummer H. Wilson K. Poumbourios P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17York J. Nunberg J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4921-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, our observations of the equivalent mutations indicate that they are improperly processed and/or that gp41 is not incorporated into the virus, as evidenced by low levels of gp41 in cell lysates and the virus. Finally, we note that the present study represents the first single-site mutations to residues Gly-594, Ser-599, Gly-600, Leu-602, Ile-603, Thr-605, Pro-609, Asn-611, Ser-613, Ser-615, Asn-616, Lys-617, Ser-618, Leu-619, Glu-620, Gln-621, and Ile-622. Of the 17 novel mutations, mutants L602A, I603A, K617A, and S618A exhibit significantly impaired function, and mutants T605A, P609A, and S613A exhibit enhanced viral entry with respect to wild-type gp41.Table IIComparison of HIV gp41 mutagenesis studiesMutantRef. 16Maerz A.

Guo Y. Kajumo F. Anselma J. Maddon P. Olson W. Moore J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In their study, pairs of non-native cysteines were introduced into the regions of HIV gp41 and gp120 that are thought to form the interaction site, and the presence of an intermolecular disulfide bond was taken to indicate close proximity of the gp41 and gp120 residues. The most reactive site of HIV gp41 and, thus, presumably a site that is directly interacting with gp120, was found at position 605, and less reactive sites were found at positions 596, 608, 609, and 610 (15Binley J. Sanders R. Clas B. Schuelke N. Master A. Guo Y. Kajumo F. Anselma J. Maddon P. Olson W. Moore J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). With respect to our studies, the W596A and V608A mutants apparently reduced viral entry due to shedding of gp120 and thus are in agreement with Binley et al. (15Binley J. Sanders R. Clas B. Schuelke N. Master A. Guo Y. Kajumo F. Anselma J. Maddon P. Olson W. Moore J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in our study the mutants T605A and P609A were found to exhibit enhanced viral entry with respect to the wild-type, and, thus, it is tempting to suggest that they cause a reorientation of the gp120 association with gp41 that is favorable for viral entry.Location of Mutants—Finally, it is of interest to consider the location of the mutations in the structure of gp41. As noted above, there is a high-resolution structure of the SIV gp41 loop available from NMR studies (8Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A. Clore G. J. Mol.

In this work, we used Tet-off PMCA antisense-expressing MCF-7 cells to assess the effects of PMCA inhibition in a human breast cancer cell line. At a level of PMCA inhibition that did not completely prevent PMCA-mediated Ca2+ efflux and did not induce cell death, a dramatic inhibition of cellular proliferation was observed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis indicated that PMCA antisense involves changes in cell cycle kinetics but not cell cycle arrest.

Biol. 2001; 36: 107-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2+ signaling is also a key regulator of proliferation (3Lipskaia L. Lompre A.M. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), cell cycle progression (4Kahl C.R. Means A.R. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and apoptosis (5Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). Modulation of capacitative Ca2+ entry, a mechanism whereby the influx of extracellular Ca2+ is coupled to the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores within the endoplasmic reticulum, is associated with the proliferative phenotype (6Ichikawa J. Furuya K. Miyata S. Nakashima T. Kiyohara T. Cell Biochem. Funct. 2000; 18: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Indeed, blockers of Ca2+ entry may be potential anti-proliferative agents (7Nie L. Oishi Y. Doi I. Shibata H. Kojima I. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Haverstick D.M. Heady T.N. MacDonald T.L. Gray L.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1002-1008PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase II also arrests HeLa cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (9Patel R. Holt M. Philipova R. Moss S. Schulman H. Hidaka H. Whitaker M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7958-7968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and apoptotic resistance conferred by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 involves modulation of Ca2+ handling by the endoplasmic reticulum (5Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2345) Google Scholar) and capacitative Ca2+ entry (10Williams S.S. French J.N. Gilbert M. Rangaswami A.A. Walleczek J. Knox S.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4358-4361PubMed Google Scholar, 11Vanden Abeele F. Skryma R. Shuba Y. Van Coppenolle F. Slomianny C. Roudbaraki M. Mauroy B. Wuytack F. Prevarskaya N.

Although the essential role of Ca2+ signaling in maintaining homeostatic functions is well established, less is known about the role of aberrant Ca2+ signaling in disease (12Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar, 13Rizzuto R. Pozzan T. Nat.

The plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; DOX, doxycycline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; 7-AAD, 7-amino-actinomycin D; PSS, physiological salt solution; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrapotassium salt; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; MTS, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt. 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; DOX, doxycycline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; 7-AAD, 7-amino-actinomycin D; PSS, physiological salt solution; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrapotassium salt; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; MTS, (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt.or pump, belongs to the family of P-type ATPases and is a critical regulator of free intracellular Ca2+ (14Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It actively extrudes Ca2+ across the plasma membrane and is important for maintaining basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels and lowering free intracellular Ca2+ after the generation of Ca2+ transients and other Ca2+ signaling events (2Carafoli E. Santella L. Branca D. Brini M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 107-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 15Monteith G.R. Roufogalis B.D. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PMCA has important roles in shaping the dynamics of Ca2+ signaling, as its activation can limit Ca2+ influx during capacitative Ca2+ entry (16Klishin A. Sedova M. Blatter L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1117-C1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PMCA overexpression decreases both the amplitude and duration of cytosolic Ca2+ responses after agonist-induced stimulation (17Brini M. Bano D. Manni S. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4926-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are four isoforms of PMCA (PMCA1-4) with additional isoform diversity generated by alternative splicing from the primary PMCA transcripts (14Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 18Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of PMCA2 and down-regulation of PMCA4 in the rat mammary gland during lactation may indicate that PMCA isoforms regulate differentiation and proliferation of the mammary gland (19Reinhardt T.A. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Horst R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1595-C1602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is also an increasing awareness that PMCA alterations are associated with tumorigenesis, including that of the mammary gland (20Kamrava M.R. Michener C.M. Kohn E.C. Pharmaceutical News. 2002; 9: 435-442Google Scholar). Indeed, relative PMCA1 mRNA expression is greater in tumorigenic breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells than that in non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells (21Lee W.J. Roberts-Thomson S.J. Holman N.A. May F.J. Lehrbach G.M. Monteith G.R. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PMCA1 and PMCA4 expression is also lower in simian virus 40-transformed human skin fibroblasts (22Reisner P.D. Brandt P.C. Vanaman T.C. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, perturbed PMCA regulation or function may be important in diseases such as cancer. Therapeutic modulation of PMCA expression and/or activity may have functional consequences in suppressing the tumorigenic phenotype. The appropriateness of PMCA as a possible drug target is also demonstrated by the prominence of other clinically used inhibitors of P-type ATPases, digoxin and omeprazole, as inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase and H+/K+-ATPase, respectively (23Chene P. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2002; 1: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Johnson P.H. Walker R.P. Jones S.W. Stephens K. Meurer J. Zajchowski D.A. Luke M.M. Eeckman F. Tan Y. Wong L. Parry G. Morgan Jr., T.K. McCarrick M.A. Monforte J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2002; 1: 1293-1304PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the dynamic regulation of PMCA expression in the mammary gland, the consequences of PMCA inhibition in breast cancer cell lines has not been addressed. Our aim was to investigate whether PMCA inhibition alters Ca2+ homeostasis, cell proliferation, and cell death in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Cell Culture—MCF-7 Tet-off cells (Clontech) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml G418, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin with the addition of 110 μg/ml hygromycin B and 100 ng/ml doxycycline (DOX) as required. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air incubator. Construction of PMCA Antisense cDNA and Cloning—A 286-base-pair cDNA fragment was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from MCF-7 Tet-off cells and cloned into the bidirectional pBI-G response plasmid (Clontech) to generate the PMCA antisense construct. The following primers were used to amplify the cDNA fragment: forward primer, 5′-TAGGTCGACGAAATGTCTATGACAGCAT-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-TAGGTCGACGGGCCCATTATCTTCTTCATCAT-3′. These primers were based on sequence information that is conserved across all human PMCA isoforms. A SalI restriction enzyme site (italics) was introduced into each primer to facilitate cloning, and an ApaI site (underlined) was incorporated into the reverse primer to assist in directional cloning. The PCR product was digested with SalI and inserted into the SalI site of the pBI-G plasmid in the antisense orientation. Following nucleotide sequencing of the antisense construct, the cDNA fragment sequence was compared against GenBank™ using BLAST version 2.2.8. Generation of a Double Stable MCF-7 Tet-off PMCA Antisense-transfected Cell Line—Parental MCF-7 Tet-off cells already stably transfected with the regulatory tetracycline-controlled transactivator were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with the prepared pBI-G PMCA antisense plasmid and the pTK-Hyg hygromycin B resistance plasmid (Clontech). Hygromycin B-resistant clones were isolated (total of 43) and screened for tetracycline-regulated β-galactosidase expression. β-Galactosidase acted as an indirect reporter for the simultaneous expression of PMCA antisense RNA when DOX was removed from the culture medium. Screening was performed using the β-galactosidase enzyme assay system with reporter lysis buffer in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Annandale, New South Wales, Australia). Eight colonies that showed differing degrees of tetracycline-regulated β-galactosidase activity (2-10-fold increases upon DOX removal) were further screened for their effect on PMCA protein with the non-isoform-specific PMCA antibody 5F10. From these colonies, three clones were assessed in subsequent proliferation assays and from the three, one clone (A7) was selected for more detailed characterization. Proliferation Assays—Cells were plated at 800 cells/well in 96-well plates by initially seeding them in DOX- and hygromycin B-free medium (100 μl/well). DOX was then added to or omitted from the wells at the time of plating (day 0). The cells were grown over a 2-week period with the medium renewed every 2-3 days, except on the last day of the experiment. The proliferation of viable cells was monitored daily from days 3 to 13 via a colorimetric MTS assay (25Goodwin C.J. Holt S.J. Downes S. Marshall N.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 179: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) by directly adding CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution reagent (20 μl; Promega) to each well and incubating plates for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air environment. After 2 h, absorbances were read at 490 nm with a Bio-Rad Model 550 microplate reader. Immunoblotting—Protein was isolated from cells plated into 10-cm diameter dishes at 1 × 105 cells/dish. The cells were seeded in DOX- and hygromycin B-free medium and then were adjusted at the time of plating to include hygromycin B, either with or without DOX (100 ng/ml). On days 3, 7, and 13, the cells were trypsinized and stored as cell pellets at -80 °C until further processing for total protein isolates. Total protein was analyzed by immunoblotting, as described previously (26Smith S.A. Monteith G.R. Holman N.A. Robinson J.A. May F.J. Roberts-Thomson S.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 72: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For each sample, 40 μg of total protein was loaded onto 7.5% gels. Antibodies were used at the following dilutions and incubated for 1 h at room temperature: 1:2000 for 5F10 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), 1:1000 for JA9 (kind gift from Dr. John T. Penniston, Department Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN), 1:1000 for NR1 (Affinity BioReagents), 1:1000 for NR2 (Affinity BioReagents), 1:1000 for IID8 (Affinity BioReagents), and 1:10,000 for anti-β-actin (AC-15, Sigma). A goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) was diluted 1:2000 or 1:1000, respectively, and used as required with incubations for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized via enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL™, Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry measurements of immunoblot bands were analyzed using MetaMorph® version 4.01 imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). For each immunoblot, the optical density values for bands representing total PMCA, PMCA4, PMCA1, PMCA2, and SERCA2 were normalized to the corresponding value for the β-actin band in each lane. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis of DNA Content—Cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/dish in 10-cm diameter dishes, in DOX- and hygromycin B-free medium and then grown in either the presence or absence of DOX. On days 7 and 13, the cells were harvested from the dishes by collecting trypsinized cells together with floating cells in the medium. For each condition, a volume of the cell suspension corresponding to 2 × 106 cells was centrifuged, and the resultant cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (0.5 ml). The cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and stained with propidium iodide. FACS analysis was performed using a BD Biosciences FACS-Calibur™ flow cytometer. DNA content histograms and cell cycle phase distributions were modeled from at least 10,000 single events by excluding the cell aggregates based on scatter plots of the fluorescence pulse area versus fluorescence pulse width using ModFit LT™ version 2.0 (Mac) software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Pulse-Chase Analysis of Cell Cycle Progression—Cells that had been growing in the presence or absence of DOX-containing medium for 6 days were plated at 1 × 106 cells/dish in 10-cm diameter dishes. After a further 24 h in the appropriate medium (±DOX), the cells were pulsed with either Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline or 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine 10 μm (BrdUrd) for 1 h, followed by one wash with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, the cells were then maintained in the appropriate medium (±DOX) until being trypsinized, centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min, and fixed at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h post-BrdUrd pulse. Collected cells were fixed and stained with the BD Biosciences fluorescein isothiocyanate BrdUrd flow kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, paraformaldehyde-fixed and saponin-permeabilized cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with DNase (300 μg/ml in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline). BrdUrd and total DNA were then stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD), respectively. Data were acquired using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer with BD Biosciences CellQuest™ version 3.3 software. For each sample, data were displayed using WinMDI version 2.8 (Joseph Trotter, facs.scripps.edu/software.html) by first gating at least 10,000 events to select a population of single cells based on density plots of the 7-AAD fluorescence pulse area (FL3-A) versus the 7-AAD fluorescence pulse width (FL3-W). Using this subpopulation of cells, density plots of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody fluorescence pulse height (FL1-H) versus 7-AAD fluorescence pulse height (FL3-H) were generated. Negative BrdUrd controls, where cells were pulsed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, were used to set the positions of quadrant markers. Assessment of Cell Morphology—Double stable MCF-7 Tet-off PMCA antisense-transfected cells were plated onto 25-mm diameter coverslips placed in a 6-well plate at 1.8 × 104 cells/well and grown either in the presence or absence of DOX. On day 13 of the culture, phase contrast images at 200× magnification were taken from five random fields using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope (Nikon Instech, Kawasaki, Japan) and MetaFluor® version 4.01 imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). Assessment of Calcium Efflux—The efflux of free intracellular Ca2+ was assessed using a fluorescence microplate reader to monitor the rate of decline in free intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) after the generation of ionomycin-induced Ca2+ transients that ranged in magnitude with varying concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophore. Subconfluent double stable MCF-7 Tet-off PMCA antisense cells grown in DOX were subcultured at a split ratio of 1:10 into new T-75 cm2 flasks containing fresh medium, either with or without DOX (100 ng/ml), and grown for 6 days. After 6 days, the cells were plated into polystyrene 96-well plates at 4 × 104 cells/well in growth medium (100 μl/well) with or without DOX, as previously treated. The cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h before loading the cells with the non-ratiometric Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 AM (8 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the loading buffer. The loading buffer (pH 7.3) was composed of 5.9 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 140 mm NaCl, 11.5 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were loaded at 37 °C for 30 min and washed once with loading buffer (no indicator) and once with physiological salt solution (PSS). PSS (pH 7.3) contained 5.9 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 140 mm NaCl, 11.5 mm glucose, and 1.8 mm CaCl2. The cells were then incubated for 15 min in PSS at room temperature (21 ± 2 °C) to minimize indicator leakage and sequestration into intracellular organelles. The PSS was removed, and the cells were washed once with loading buffer and then twice with PSS in which NaCl was replaced with an equimolar amount of N-methyl-d-glucamine and CaCl2 was excluded (Na+/Ca2+-free PSS). Cells loaded with fluo-4 were stimulated with 50-420 nm ionomycin in Na+/Ca2+-free PSS containing 100 μm BAPTA (Molecular Probes) and 5 μm cyclopiazonic acid to obtain various levels of peak [Ca2+]i and establish a Ca2+ efflux profile curve. A calcium chelator, BAPTA was included to block Ca2+ influx (27Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the addition of cyclopiazonic acid prevented Ca2+ sequestration into the endoplasmic reticulum by SERCA; this concentration was selected based on previous studies (28Usachev Y.M. DeMarco S.J. Campbell C. Strehler E.E. Thayer S.A. Neuron. 2002; 33: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and after cyclopiazonic acid dose response curves were generated in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Na+/Ca2+-free PSS was used throughout the experiment to prevent the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger from contributing to Ca2+ efflux (27Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19529-19535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Sedova M. Blatter L.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hence the rate of decline in [Ca2+]i was predominately a measure of PMCA-mediated free intracellular Ca2+ efflux. Experiments were performed using a NOVOstar® fluorescence microplate reader (BMG LabTechnologies, Offenburg, Germany). Fluo-4 was excited at 485 nm, and fluorescence emission was detected at 520 nm. Fluo-4 fluorescence data points were acquired every 1.5 s. All experiments were performed at 31 ± 1 °C. Relative changes in [Ca2+]i using fluo-4 were determined by calculations of ΔF/F, where ΔF/F = (Ft - F0)/F0. In this equation, Ft equals the fluorescence reading at each time point (t), and F0 represents initial fluorescence at t = 0 (30Laskey A.D. Roth B.J. Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For each well, where peak [Ca2+]i was obtained within 90.5 s following the addition of ionomycin, the fluorescence data corresponding to the 60 s after and including the peak ΔF/F was fitted to a monoexponential curve as a measure of the rate of PMCA-mediated free intracellular Ca2+ efflux (29Sedova M. Blatter L.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—All data points are presented as means ± S.D., unless otherwise stated, for the number of replicates (n) indicated. Meaningful comparisons between groups were analyzed for statistical significance using a two-sided Student's t test with significance set at p < 0.05. PMCA Antisense Induction Suppresses Proliferation of MCF-7 Tet-off Breast Cancer Cells—To generate a cell line where PMCA antisense could be tightly controlled and equivalent levels of expression could be obtained, we generated a MCF-7 Tet-off PMCA antisense cell line, where the removal of DOX induced PMCA antisense expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based upon initial screening for tetracycline-regulated β-galactosidase expression as a marker for the simultaneous expression of PMCA antisense and the sensitivity of PMCA expression to doxycycline removal, proliferation assays were conducted for three MCF-7 Tet-off PMCA antisense-transfected clones. All three clones exhibited inhibition of proliferation upon antisense induction, and one clone (A7) was selected for more detailed characterization. The effect of antisense expression on proliferation is shown in Fig. 1A for A7. Controls included identical experiments using parental MCF-7 Tet-off cells (Fig. 1B) and a MCF-7 Tet-off cell line with regulated expression of both β-galactosidase and a protein unrelated to PMCA (Fig. 1C). The induction of PMCA antisense (DOX absence) profoundly suppressed the proliferation of MCF-7 (A7) cells over a period of 13 days (Fig. 1A). The removal of DOX did not affect the proliferation of the controls (Fig. 1, B and C). Effect of PMCA Antisense Induction on PMCA Protein Expression—To evaluate whether tetracycline-regulated PMCA antisense inhibits PMCA protein expression, we used immunoblotting (Fig. 2) to probe for total PMCA protein using the non-isoform-specific 5F10 antibody and isoform-specific antibodies to PMCA4, PMCA1, and PMCA2 (31Filoteo A.G. Elwess N.L. Enyedi A. Caride A. Aung H.H. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23741-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were repeated twice for two independent sets of protein isolated from MCF-7 (A7) cells. A representative immunoblot is shown for total PMCA protein (Fig. 2A). As shown by densitometry measurements, a significant (p = 0.005) decrease in total PMCA protein expression was observed on day 13 in cells expressing PMCA antisense (DOX absence) compared with no antisense-expressing cells (DOX presence) (Fig. 2B). Relative PMCA4 levels increased with days in culture, implicating a potential role for PMCA4 in proliferation, and this increase was inhibited in cells expressing antisense (Fig. 2, C and D). By day 13 of growth, PMCA4 protein expression was significantly (p = 0.007) lower in PMCA antisense-induced MCF-7 (A7) cells, in contrast to the parallel non-induced control (Fig. 2D). We also showed for the first time, PMCA1 and PMCA2 protein in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2, E and G). PMCA1 was only modestly increased in relative expression with days in culture, which was not significantly attenuated by PMCA antisense (Fig. 2, E and F). Consistent with its likely role in specific cellular functions, such as lactation (19Reinhardt T.A. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Horst R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1595-C1602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Reinhardt T.A. Lippolis J.D. Shull G.E. Horst R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42369-42373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), PMCA2 levels did not alter with days in culture and proliferation (Fig. 2, G and H). Effect of PMCA Antisense Induction on SERCA2 Protein Expression—Due to the regulatory link between PMCA and SERCA expression (33Kuo T.H. Liu B.F. Yu Y. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Tsang W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we assessed the effects of PMCA antisense-mediated inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation on SERCA2 expression. The modest increase in SERCA2 expression at day 13 was attenuated when MCF-7 cell proliferation was inhibited via PMCA antisense (Fig. 3). PMCA Antisense Induction Alters Cell Cycle Phase Distribution—We next investigated the effect of PMCA antisense on cell cycle phase distribution by performing FACS analysis of DNA content using asynchronous cultures of MCF-7 (A7) cells, which were grown in either the presence or absence of DOX for 7 and 13 days. Fig. 4 shows (for each growth condition) percentages of the total number of cells modeled that were present in G0/G1, S, or G2/M phases of the cell cycle. There were no significant differences in the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase between MCF-7 (A7) cells grown in either the presence or absence of DOX for both 7 and 13 days (Fig. 4A). However, PMCA antisense induction significantly (p = 0.005, day 7; p = 0.006, day 13) decreased the percentage of cells present in S phase (Fig. 4B). PMCA antisense induction also significantly (p = 0.008, day 7; p = 0.013, day 13) increased the percentage of cells in G2/M phase (Fig. 4C). FACS analysis revealed the absence of a noticeable sub-G0/G1 peak, at either day 7 or 13, in a set of propidium iodide-stained PMCA antisense-induced MCF-7 (A7) cells (data not shown). To further assess the mechanism by which PMCA antisense induction inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 (A7) cells, we conducted BrdUrd pulse-chase experiments. Results (Fig. 5) are representative of two independent experiments. PMCA antisense induction (DOX absence) in MCF-7 (A7) cells resulted in fewer BrdUrd-positive cells at 0 h after the BrdUrd pulse (12-12.9%) compared with the controls (DOX presence; 26-26.8%). This is consistent with the significant reduction of S phase cells, as previously shown in Fig. 4B. At 6 h post-pulse, cells were progressing into G2/M in both control and antisense-induced groups. At 12 h, the emergence of a BrdUrd-positive peak with a G0/G1 DNA content in both PMCA antisense-induced (DOX absence) and -non-induced controls (DOX presence) indicated that PMCA antisense-induced cells were still actively transiting S and G2/M phases (Fig. 5A). Thus PMCA antisense expression in MCF-7 (A7) cells did not result in S or G2/M phase arrest. At 24 h post-pulse, PMCA antisense induction resulted in fewer BrdUrd-positive cells with a G0/G1 DNA content (11.3-12.4%) compared with controls (26.2-27.5%), indicating a slower transition through G2/M phase. No apparent differences in S and G2/M phase progression were found for parental MCF-7 Tet-off cells at the 0, 6, and 12 h time points (data not shown) or the 24 h time point (Fig. 5B). Induction of PMCA Antisense Inhibits PMCA-mediated Efflux of Free Intracellular Calcium—The effect of PMCA antisense on the primary functional role of PMCA was assessed by comparing the rate of PMCA-mediated efflux of free intracellular Ca2+ between MCF-7 (A7) cells that were cultured either with or without DOX for 7 days (Fig. 6). Data were obtained by stimulating Ca2+ transients with ionomycin (50-420 nm) and then monitoring PMCA-mediated declines in [Ca2+]i between pairs of wells containing either PMCA antisense-induced or -non-induced MCF-7 (A7) cells. Ionomycin was selected to reduce the activation of other pathways known to alter PMCA activity (28Usachev Y.M. DeMarco S.J. Campbell C. Strehler E.E. Thayer S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2131479899,"Hemoglobins at high concentration have been isolated long ago from some insect larvae living in hypoxic environments. Conversely, a monomeric hemoglobin has been discovered recently in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as intracellular protein expressed both in larvae and in the adult fly. Such a finding indicates that the oxygen supply in insects may be more complex than previously thought, relying not only on O2 diffusion through the tubular tracheal system, but also on carrier-mediated transport and storage. We present here the crystal structure of recombinant D. melanogaster hemoglobin at 1.20 Å resolution. Spectroscopic data show that the protein displays a hexacoordinated heme, whose axial ligands are the proximal and distal His residues. Such bis-His ligation of the heme has sizable effects on the protein local structure. Three protein matrix cavities, comparable in size but not in topological locations with those of sperm whale myoglobin, are spread through the protein matrix; one of these can host a xenon atom. Additionally, D. melanogaster hemoglobin binds one molecule of 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer at a surface pocket, next to the EF hinge. Despite the high resolution achieved, no sequence/structure features specifically supporting the heme hexa- to pentacoordination transition required for diatomic ligand binding could be recognized.

Insects inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide with the aid of the tracheal system, a tubular structure that connects their inner organs to the air. The trachea efficiently supports the passive diffusion of oxygen to the metabolically active tissues. Therefore, the presence of specific respiratory hemolymph proteins for the transport of oxygen has been regarded as unnecessary in this taxon (1Willmer P. Stone G. Johnston I.A. Environmental Physiology of Animals. Blackwell Press, Oxford2000Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a few insects possess either of two types of oxygen carriers, hemoglobins (Hbs) 1The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; CYGB, human cytoglobin; DmHb, D. melanogaster hemoglobin; GiHb, G. intestinalis Hb; Hc, hemocyanin; Mb, myoglobin; mNgb, mouse neuroglobin; NGB human neuroglobin; r.m.s., root mean square. or hemocyanins (Hcs) (2van Holde K.E.

A functional Hc has been identified so far only in the nymphs and adults of the stonefly Perla marginata (Plecoptera) (5Hagner-Holler S. Schoen A. Erker W. Marden J.H. Rupprecht R. Decker H. Burmester T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This Hc is composed of two distinct subunits and displays cooperative oxygen binding (n ∼ 2) with moderately oxygen affinity (P50 ∼ 8 torr). No evidence has so far been found for the presence of Hc in the more evolutionarily advanced neopterin insects, suggesting that this type of respiratory protein was later lost in insect evolution (2van Holde K.E.

Hbs at high concentrations have been found in a few insects that live, at least temporarily, in a hypoxic environment, such as the aquatic larvae of chironomid midges (6Osmulski P. Leyko W. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1986; 85: 701-722Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), some aquatic backswimmers (7Wells R.M.G. Hudson M.J. Brittain T. J. Comp.

These species harbor single chain Hbs (∼150 amino acids) in millimolar concentrations which either transport oxygen in the hemolymph (midges) or store oxygen in specialized tissues (backswimmers and botfly) (3Weber R.

Twelve different Hb polypeptides and more than 30 Hb genes have been identified in Chironomus (10Green B.N. Kuchumov A.R. Hankeln T. Schmidt E.R. Bergtrom G. Vinogradov S.N. Biochim. Biophys.

All Chironomus Hbs investigated so far have similar oxygen binding properties, are characterized by a myoglobin (Mb)-like oxygen affinity (P50 = 0.6-1.5 torr, at pH 7.0 and 20 °C), are not cooperative heme-proteins, and most of them show an alkaline Bohr effect (13La Mar G.N.

The three-dimensional structure of Chironomus thummi thummi Hb III, displaying 20% amino acid identity to sperm whale Mb, matches closely the standard globin fold (15Huber R. Epp O. Steigemann W.

Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These Hbs enable the Chironomus larvae to tolerate nearly anoxic environments (7Wells R.M.G. Hudson M.J. Brittain T. J. Comp. Physiol. 1981; 142: 515-522Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and may help explain the spread of more than chironomid species throughout the world (3Weber R. Vinogradov S.N. Physiol.

Recently, a monomeric Hb of 153 amino acids (17 kDa) has been discovered in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (DmHb) (19Burmester T. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 1809-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Hankeln T. Jaenicke V. Kiger L. Dewilde S. Ungerechts G. Schmidt M. Urban J. Marden M.C. Moens L. Burmester T. J. Biol.

It is an intracellular protein that is expressed at low concentration in the tracheal system and in the fat body of embryonic, larval, and adult flies. DmHb is produced by four transcripts with identical coding regions but different 5′-exons, which are generated by two distinct promoters of the dmeglob1 gene. Amino acid comparisons show significant sequence similarity with the Hbs from the Chironomidae, whereas the highest similarity score was found with the Hb of G. intestinalis (GiHb; 39% amino acid identity; Fig. 1A). Recombinant DmHb displays a typical hexacoordinated heme absorption spectrum both in the ferric form and in the deoxygenated ferrous form, binding oxygen noncooperatively with an affinity of ∼ 0.12 torr (20Hankeln T. Jaenicke V. Kiger L. Dewilde S. Ungerechts G. Schmidt M. Urban J. Marden M.C. Moens L. Burmester T. J. Biol.

Hankeln, unpublished results. indicating that the insect oxygen supply can be more complex than previously thought and may partly rely on carrier-mediated oxygen transport and storage (19Burmester T.

The physiological role of insect Hbs expressed at low cellular concentrations is, however, still obscure. Although Hbs, Hcs, and Mbs have long been considered oxygen transport or storage proteins, recent evidence indicates that some heme-proteins serve the detoxification of nitric oxide, the regeneration of NAD+ under anaerobic conditions, or act as oxygen sensors (3Weber R.

In the context of our ongoing studies on the biological role of hexacoordinated Hbs and on the molecular mechanisms regulating heme-ligand binding and Hb action, we report here the three-dimensional structure of DmHb, the product of the dmeglob1 gene, studied by x-ray diffraction analysis at very high resolution (1.20 Å). DmHb cDNA was cloned into the pET3a expression vector. Using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), the Cys121 residue at position GH1 was mutated to Ser to avoid irreversible protein aggregation during the crystallization stage. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Cells were grown at 25 °C in TB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1.0 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid. Hb expression was induced at A600 = 0.8 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and expression was continued overnight. The bacteria were harvested, dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and subsequently broken with three freeze-thaw cycles followed by sonication. The debris was removed by two centrifugation steps (10 min at 10,000 × g, and 60 min at 105,000 × g). Further purification was achieved by 40 and 90% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. The 90% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 pellet, which contains the crude Hb pellet, was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, dialyzed overnight, and loaded onto a Fast Flow DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing of the unbound material, DmHb was eluted with 200 mm NaCl. The DmHb fractions were concentrated by Amicon filtration (PM10) and passed through a Sephacryl S200 column. The final DmHb fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at -20 °C until use (20Hankeln T. Jaenicke V. Kiger L. Dewilde S. Ungerechts G. Schmidt M. Urban J. Marden M.C. Moens L. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29012-29017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). DmHb crystals were grown in the sitting drop vapor diffusion setup, against a reservoir solution containing 34% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m MgCl2, 0.05 m CAPS (pH 10-11.5), at 4 °C. The protein stock solution concentration was 72 mg/ml; crystallization droplets were composed of 1.0 μl reservoir and 1.0 μl stock protein solution. Well shaped prismatic crystals of 300 μm × 100 μm × 5 μm size grew in about 1 week. The crystals chosen for x-ray data collection were transferred to the same buffer medium used for growth, containing 40% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 for cryoprotection. X-ray diffraction data, to a maximum resolution of 1.6 Å, were collected at ESRF (Grenoble, France), on beam line ID29, using one frozen crystal (at 100 K) at wavelength λ = 1.7410 Å (Table I), to maximize the contribution of the anomalous signal of the heme iron atom, after measurement of the crystal x-ray fluorescence spectrum. A high resolution data set was subsequently collected on a crystal from the same batch, at 1.20 Å resolution (at λ = 0.9795 Å; Table I). The collected data were reduced and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA, respectively (33Leslie A.G.M. MOSFLM User Guide, Mosflm Version 6.2.3.

The structure was solved using a phased molecular replacement approach; initial phases were obtained with the SAD technique, based on the anomalous scattering of the heme iron atom.Table ISummary of the data collection and refinement statistics for DmHbData collection statistics at the iron absorption edge (left), high resolution native (center), and xenon-treated crystal (right)Wavelength (Å)1.74100.97950.9537Resolution (Å)55.9-1.5950.0-1.2041.5-1.50Mosaicity (°)0.520.550.42Completeness (%)82.0 (18.2)aOuter shell statistics (1.63-1.59 Å) are shown within parentheses.87.9 (92.0)bOuter shell statistics (1.26-1.20 Å) are shown within parentheses.98.1 (90.1)cOuter shell statistics (1.58-1.50 Å) are shown within parentheses.Rmerge (%)8.0 (38.2)12.8 (11.3)6.8 (14.3)Total reflections121,017151,95184,717Unique reflections15,05336,70621,044Redundancy8 (2)4 (3)4 (3)Average I/σ(I)22.4 (3.3)12.1 (6.6)16.6 (7.2)Anom. compl.79.8 (10.0)Anom. redun.4.3 (1.4)Refinement statistics and model qualityDmHbResolution range (Å)28.7.0-1.20Protein atoms3588Water molecules318R-factor/R-freedCalculated using 5% of the reflections.

Open table in a new tab The iron atom site was located in the λ = 1.7410 Å data set using a combination of SHELXD (35Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The iron site was used to calculate initial phases using SHARP (36La Fortelle E. de Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), which were improved through density modification with SOLOMON (37Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Subsequently, using as search model the lamprey Hb structure (PDB code 2LHB), phased molecular replacement was performed with MOLREP (38Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar). Further density modification cycles performed again with SOLOMON (37Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) confirmed the correct solution, which was improved using ARP/wARP (39Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) through atom addition and deletion. The best map then obtained was successfully autotraced by ARP/wARP (39Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Initial refinement was performed with BUSTER-TNT (40Blanc E. Roversi P. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Lea S.M. Bricogne G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2210-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), including some side chain adjustments and placing of the heme group. The partial DmHb model (lacking two amino acids in the N-terminal region, and the Leu76-Glu78 loop) was subsequently refined and completed at 1.20 Å resolution (isotropic B-factors) using the program REFMAC (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), to R-factor and R-free values of 15.3 and 16.7%, respectively. Manual model adjustments were performed using the O suite (42Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Finally, individual anisotropic atomic B-factors were refined using REFMAC (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) (R-factor 11.0%, R-free 14.8%), and in the last refinement cycles hydrogen atoms were added (R-factor 10.0%, R-free 13.4%; Table I). The final model contains 153 residues, 318 water molecules, two octahedral aquo-Mg complexes, one chloride anion, and one molecule of the CAPS buffer, with ideal stereochemical parameters (43Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) (Table I). The estimated atomic positional error is 0.053 Å (44Cruickshank D.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Subsequently one crystal was treated in a 20-bar xenon gas pressurized cell, for 20 min; diffraction data were then collected at ESRF on beam line ID23, to the maximum resolution of 1.50 Å. The structure of the DmHb·Xe complex was analyzed first through difference Fourier techniques, then refined using the program REFMAC (41Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The corresponding final model contains 153 residues, 199 water molecules, two octahedral aquo-Mg complexes, and two xenon atoms (R-factor 15.8%, R-free 19.2%), with ideal stereochemical parameters (43Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) (Table I). Absorption spectra, collected on dissolved crystals, indicate that DmHb is present as a mixture of ferrous and ferric forms, already in freshly grown crystals. Protein matrix cavities were calculated using the program Surfnet (45Laskowsi R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) and a 1.4 Å radius probe (Fig. 2). Atomic coordinates and structure factors for DmHb have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, as data sets 2BK9 and R2BK9, respectively (www.rcsb.org/pdb) (46Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z.

Overall DmHb Structure—The three-dimensional structure of DmHb (bearing the Cys121(GH1) → Ser mutation) was solved by phased molecular replacement, with initial phases obtained through the SAD method, based on the anomalous signal of the heme iron atom. Refinement of the crystal structure, including anisotropic B-factor refinement and fixed hydrogen atoms, converged at a conventional R-factor value of 10.0% (R-free 13.4%), at 1.20 Å resolution (Table I). As implied by the amino acid sequence and supported by the molecular replacement technique adopted in the phasing, the DmHb protein fold matches well the three-over-three α-helical sandwich fold of classical Hbs and Mbs, where the eight helices building up the globin fold are conventionally labeled A-H, according to their sequential order (47Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 327-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 48Bashford D. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol.

Structural overlay of the DmHb structure on sperm whale Mb (PDB code 1A6N), taken as the parent globin structure, yields a r.m.s. deviation of 2.18 Å (calculated over 134 Cα pairs) (Fig. 1B). The largest deviations occur in the CD-D region, where DmHb displays a scarcely helical D segment, in the N-terminal region of the E-helix, in the following EF hinge, which is three residues longer in DmHb, and in the GH hinge, two residues longer in sperm whale Mb (Fig. 1A). A modest (0.5 Å) shift of the heme group toward the EF interhelical hinge region is observed in sperm whale Mb, relative to DmHb. A comparably high r.m.s. deviation value (2.0 Å, for 75 Cα pairs) is found when the DmHb backbone is compared with that of Hb III from the larvae of the midge C. thummi thummi (PDB code 1ECO). In this case, structural deviations appear to be distributed throughout the protein chain, with a tendency to higher deviations in the F-G-H helical segments. Additionally, the heme group in DmHb appears to be more deeply located within the heme crevice, by about 2.7 Å, relative to C. thummi thummi Hb III, possibly related to 100% heme isomerism observed in the crystal structure of the latter protein (17Steigemann W. Weber E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 309-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Because the heme group in DmHb displays a bis-His hexacoordination (see below), it is of particular interest to examine the protein structure in relation to other hexacoordinate Hbs recently reported, particularly human cytoglobin (CYGB; PDB code 1UTO), human neuroglobin (NGB; PDB code 1OJ6), mouse neuroglobin (mNgb; PDB code 1Q1F), Caudina arenicola Hb (PDB code 1HLB), and rice nonsymbiotic Hb (PDB code 1D8U) (29de Sanctis D.

Structural overlay of DmHb on CYGB yields a r.m.s. deviation of 0.98 Å for 110 Cα pairs, thus indicating a very good match to the CYGB Cα trace. As noted above for sperm whale Mb, a two-residue insertion in DmHb EF hinge causes some local structural deviation in the two proteins, which also deviate somewhat at the C-terminal region of the G helix. Overlay of DmHb and NGB structures yields a r.m.s. deviation of 1.31 Å for 85 Cα pairs. The main differences are located in the protein CD region, related to the widely open conformation displayed by the CD heme distal region in NGB. Deviations at the EF hinge are also present, as noted above, related to a three-residue insertion in DmHb. Structural overlay on C. arenicola Hb yields a r.m.s. deviation of 1.76 Å (calculated over 107 Cα pairs). The main differences in comparing the two structures are located in the extended N-terminal region of C. arenicola Hb which has no counterparts in the DmHb structure, in the EF hinge, with a three-residue insertion in DmHb, and in the GH loop, which is two residues longer in C. arenicola Hb. The overlay of DmHb and rice Hb yields a r.m.s. deviation of 2.17 Å, for 83 Cα pairs. Again, the main differences are observed in the CD region, where the rice Hb structure is poorly defined, and in the EF-F regions. It should be noted that the EF hinge region is more extended in rice Hb than in other globins, whereas the F helix is shorter by five residues (52Hargrove M.S. Brucker E.A. Stec B. Sarath G.

Many reports indicate that ATP is essential for NPR-A and NPR-B activation. Current models suggest that natriuretic peptide binding to receptor extracellular domains causes ATP binding to intracellular kinase homology domains, which derepresses adjacent catalytic domains. Here, we report 100-fold activations of natriuretic peptide receptors in the absence of ATP. The addition of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog had no effect at early time periods (measured in seconds) but increased cGMP production about 2-fold after longer incubations (measured in minutes), consistent with a stabilization, not activation, mechanism. These data indicate that ATP does not activate natriuretic peptide receptors as has been repeatedly reported. Instead, ATP increases activity primarily by maintaining proper receptor phosphorylation status but also serves a previously unappreciated enzyme stabilizing function.

Natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B), also known as guanylyl cyclase B, is activated by C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) (7Koller K.J. Lowe D.G. Bennett G.L. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H.

NPR-A and NPR-B are members of the human transmembrane guanylyl cyclase family, which also includes StaR (GC-C), the receptor for heat-stabile enterotoxin, guanylin, and uroguanylin, as well as the two retinal cyclases, RetGC-1 and RetGC-2 (GC-E and GC-F), critical regulators of phototransduction (9Potter L.R. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1205-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each member has an ∼500-amino acid extracellular domain that has been shown to bind peptide ligands for NPR-A, NPR-B, and StaR. A single membrane-spanning region joins the extracellular and intracellular portions of these enzymes. The latter portion consists of kinase homology, coiled-coiled dimerization, and carboxyl-terminal guanylyl cyclase domains (10Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Activation of NPR-A requires natriuretic peptide binding to its extracellular domain at a stoichiometry of 1:2 (11Ogawa H. Qiu Y. Ogata C.M. Misono K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28625-28631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which results in a “tightening” of its juxtamembrane region (12Labrecque J. Deschenes J. McNicoll N. De Lean A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8064-8072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ATP was first reported to inhibit ANP binding (13De Lean A. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but shortly thereafter was shown to increase ANP-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity (14Song D.L. Kohse K.P. Murad F.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In analogy to GTP-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase, these reports led to an ATP-dependent activation model for guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptors. Because adenine analogs like AMPPNP that presumably cannot serve as substrates for protein kinases partially mimic the effect of ATP, it was suggested that ATP allosterically regulates NPR-A (15Kurose H. Inagami T. Ui M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, cDNA cloning revealed the presence of a motif within the kinase homology domain of NPR-A that resembles the canonical ATP-binding glycine elbow found in many protein kinases (22Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Chin H.M. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 23Lowe D.G. Chang M.S. Hellmiss R. Chen E. Singh S. Garbers D.L. Goeddel D.V. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1377-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Because the mutation of this motif resulted in diminished hormonal responsiveness of NPR-A and NPR-B, it was termed the ATP regulatory module (24Duda T. Goraczniak R.M. Sharma R.K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Goraczniak R.M. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Together, these data led to a two-step model in which natriuretic peptide-binding facilitates direct ATP binding to the kinase homology domains of NPR-A and NPR-B, which ultimately causes the formation of two active sites per catalytic dimer (10Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This description represents the model for natriuretic peptide receptor activation that is most frequently cited in reviews of the field (10Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Cell Biochem. 2002; 230: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). More recent studies suggest that the ATP-dependent regulation of the kinase homology domains of NPR-A and NPR-B also involves changes in their phosphorylation state, a process that is required for natriuretic peptide receptor activation (30Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15533-15539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 31Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For instance, mutations that disrupt the putative ATP regulator module in NPR-B reduce the phosphate content of the receptor (30Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15533-15539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Additionally, ATPγS sensitizes NPR-A to subsequent activation by ANP and AMPPNP, indicating that in broken cell assays ATP serves as a substrate for the protein kinase that phosphorylates NPR-A (32Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16311-16318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, even in studies in which ATP was implicated in receptor phosphorylation, an adenine nucleotide was still required for enzyme activation, presumably because ATP binding to the kinase homology domain is essential for activation (32Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16311-16318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, we show that when membranes are prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and assayed for short time periods, NPR-A and NPR-B are activated 50–200-fold in the absence of ATP. Surprisingly, the addition of ATP had no effect on activity at early time periods. However, upon prolonged exposure, it increased hormone-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity by a mechanism involving enzyme stabilization, not activation. For the first time, these data demonstrate that ATP is not an allosteric activator of NPR-A and NPR-B. Instead, they indicate that the primary effect of ATP is to keep NPR-A and NPR-B phosphorylated and that a secondary effect is to stabilize the cyclase activity of these receptors. Together, these data support a new single-step model for natriuretic peptide receptor activation. Membrane Preparation—HEK293T or NIH3T3 cells stably expressing NPR-A (293T-NPR-A or 3T3-NPR-A) or NPR-B (293T-NPR-B) were grown and maintained as described previously (33Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J.

Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Crude membranes were prepared by washing cells at 4 °C with phosphate-buffered saline and scraping them off the plate in the presence of either phosphatase inhibitor buffer (25 mm Hepes, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 μm microcystin, and 8.6 mg/10 ml Sigma protease inhibitor mixture (P8465)) or homogenizing buffer (50 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Suspended cells were sonicated for 1–2 s and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in either phosphatase inhibitor buffer or homogenizing buffer at a protein concentration of 5–10 mg/ml. For experiments shown in Fig. 2, membranes were repeatedly resuspended in 1 ml of phosphatase inhibitor buffer and pelleted by centrifugation. Guanylyl Cyclase Assays—All of the guanylyl cyclase reactions were at 37 °C. Except for those shown in the top panel of Fig. 4, all of the assays contained cyclase mixture 1 (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm microcystin, and 10–30 μCi of [α-32P]GTP). Where indicated in Figs. 1, 2, 3, reactions also included 1 μm rat ANP, 1 μm rat CNP, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm AMPPNP, 1% Triton X-100, and 3 mm MnCl2. Assays were started by adding 50–55 μl of prewarmed reaction mixture to tubes containing 15–20 μl of membranes and 30 μl of activators (natriuretic peptides and/or adenine analogs). Assays were stopped with zinc acetate, and cGMP was purified as described previously (35Abbey S.E. Potter L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42423-42430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).

Then water (basal), 1 μm ANP, or 1 μm ANP and 1 mm AMPPNP were added, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 10 min. The experiment shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4 was conducted exactly as described for the top panel of Fig. 4 except that the membranes were prepared in phosphatase inhibitor buffer and the cyclase reaction contained mixture 1.Fig. 1ATP-independent activation of NPR-A and NPR-B.

Samples were then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and precleared by rotating for 20 min at 4 °C with 50 μl of immobilized protein A beads followed by low speed centrifugation. 800 μl of sample were transferred to a new tube and incubated overnight with 2 μl of rabbit polyclonal antiserum 6325 against NPR-A. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described previously (36Bryan P.M. Potter L.R. J. Biol.

ATP Is Not Required for Maximal Natriuretic Peptide Receptor Activation—In the process of investigating the calcium-dependent inhibition of NPR-B, we performed guanylyl cyclase assays on membranes prepared from HEK293T cells stably expressing NPR-B (293T-NPR-B). In contrast to previous reports where the absence of ATP was associated with a complete failure of CNP to activate NPR-B (21Duda T. Goraczniak R.M. Sitaramayya A. Sharma R.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), CNP alone increased cyclase activity over 200-fold in our assay (Fig. 1, top left). The inclusion of AMPPNP did not further increase CNP-dependent activity, and the inclusion of ATP resulted in slight increases that were not statistically significant. Similarly, the addition of ANP to membranes from HEK-293T-NPR-A cells increased guanylyl cyclase activity about 50-fold (Fig. 1, top right). As with NPR-B, the inclusion of AMPPNP did not increase cyclase activity, and the ATP-dependent increases were not statistically significant. These data demonstrate that NPR-A and NPR-B are maximally activated in the absence of ATP, which is not consistent with a model in which ATP binding is required for receptor activation. To determine whether adenine nucleotides affect the sensitivity of NPR-A and NPR-B to natriuretic peptide stimulation, we performed concentration-response experiments in the presence or absence of AMPPNP or ATP (Fig. 1, bottom panels). We observed no statistically significant differences in the CNP or ANP concentrations required to elicit half of the maximum response in the presence or absence of the adenine nucleotides (Fig. 1, insets, bottom panels). Thus, our data indicate that adenine nucleotides neither increase natriuretic peptide-dependent receptor sensitivity (Fig. 1, bottom panels) nor increase maximal activation levels (Fig. 1, top panels). Because it was formally possible that the activation of our crude membranes was due to cellular ATP contamination, we performed guanylyl cyclase assays on membranes that were washed successively three or four times with phosphatase inhibitor buffer. We hypothesized that if activation were a function of ATP contamination, then the more highly washed membranes would be less responsive to natriuretic peptide stimulation. We found that washing had no effect on the hormone responsiveness of either receptor (Fig. 2). In fact, we found that natriuretic peptides stimulated these highly washed membranes to about the same level as did manganese and Triton X-100, conditions thought to activate particulate guanylyl cyclases to their maximum levels. We observed similar results in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing NPR-A, indicating that ATP-independent activation of these receptors is not limited to the 293 model system (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Interestingly, unlike the assays in Fig. 1, in these experiments we observed more activity in the presence of ATP and natriuretic peptide than with natriuretic peptide alone. ATP Stabilizes the Guanylyl Cyclase Activity of NPR-A and NPR-B—One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the effects of ATP on the cyclase activities measured in Figs. 1 and 2 is the reaction time. The membranes described in Fig. 1 were assayed for 15 s, whereas in Fig. 2 they were assayed for 1 min. Therefore, we investigated the ability of AMPPNP to increase the guanylyl cyclase activity of NPR-A and NPR-B as a function of time. We used AMPPNP instead of ATP to rule out the effect of phosphorylation on potential activity changes. As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3, AMPPNP had no statistically significant effect on the activity of NPR-A until the membranes had been incubated for 300 s. However, for every subsequent time point, the amount of activity measured in the presence of AMPPNP was significantly higher than that measured in its absence. Similar results were obtained for NPR-B except that a significant effect of AMPPNP was observed after 180 s (Fig. 3, bottom panel). These are the first data to demonstrate that the increased natriuretic peptide-dependent cyclase activities result from the ability of AMPPNP to maintain initial reaction rates. In other words, these data indicate that AMPPNP is stabilizing, not activating, NPR-A and NPR-B. Buffers That Yield Highest Cyclase Activity Yield More Highly Phosphorylated Receptors—Finally, we asked why we observed robust ATP-independent activations of natriuretic peptide receptors when other investigations observed either no activation or severely diminished responses. Clearly one reason is the short duration of our assays (15 s). All other reports describe much longer assay periods (10 min). However, another contributing factor became apparent during our attempts to demonstrate ATPγS-dependent sensitization of NPR-A to ANP stimulation as originally reported (32Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16311-16318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this assay, membranes from 3T3-NPR-A cells were prepared in a phosphatase inhibitor-deficient buffer and incubated in the presence of 10 μm concentrations of AMPPNP, ATP, or ATPγS at 37 °C to sensitize NPR-A to subsequent 10-min activations with ANP in the presence or absence of 1 mm AMPPMP. As in the original report (32Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16311-16318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we found that membranes preincubated with ATPγS were more active than those preincubated with ATP, AMPPNP, or buffer, presumably because thiophosphorylated NPR-A is resistant to dephosphorylation (Fig. 4, top). We also found that cyclase activities were higher in reaction mixtures containing ANP and AMPPNP compared with ANP alone, although unlike in the original report we observed a statistically significant (p = 0.05) 2.5-fold activation in the absence of AMPPNP. Interestingly, the specific activities obtained under these conditions were dramatically lower than those observed in our previous assays using membranes from the same cells (Fig. 2, middle). When we repeated this assay using our normal cell lysis (phosphatase inhibitor buffer) and cyclase reaction buffers that contain phosphatase inhibitors, EDTA, and higher GTP concentrations, specific activities were restored to the previous levels (Fig. 4, middle; please note y axis scale change). Importantly, the ability of ANP to prominently activate NPR-A in the absence of adenine nucleotides was also restored. Although cyclase levels in this assay were increased about 2-fold by AMPPNP, this is what would be expected because of stabilization in a 10-min assay (Fig. 3). These data indicate that the more than 100-fold disparity between our activities and the activities obtained by other laboratories is due to differences in the composition of the buffers used to prepare the membranes and measure cyclase activity. Given that our lysis and cyclase reaction buffers included phosphatase inhibitors (mixture 1), whereas the buffers that resulted in diminished activity did not (mixture 2), we asked whether the phosphorylation state of NPR-A isolated in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors was higher than that of NPR-A isolated from buffers lacking these inhibitors. To accomplish this goal, we treated 3T3-NPR-A membranes exactly as described in the top and middle panels of Fig. 4. However, instead of stopping the cyclase reactions with zinc acetate as is normally done for a cyclase assay, we solubilized the receptors in immunoprecipitation buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors and purified it by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. We then measured NPR-A phosphate content and protein levels by incubating the resulting gel with ProQ Diamond and SYPRO Ruby dyes, respectively (Fig. 4, bottom). We found that the amount of NPR-A isolated using the two procedures was unaffected by the buffer constituents (SYPRO Ruby), whereas the phosphorylation state of NPR-A was markedly higher when isolated with buffers containing phosphatase inhibitors (ProQ Diamond). Data from three separate experiments (n = 6) indicated that NPR-A purified in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (mixture 1 = 1 arbitrary units ± 0.05) contained more than twice as much phosphate as NPR-A purified in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors (mixture 2 = 0.47 arbitrary units ± 0.09). These differences were significant at a p value of 0.0003 and suggest that the differences in enzymatic activity result, at least in part, from changes in the NPR-A phosphorylation state. Hence, the reason that AMPPNP has a greater effect on ANP-dependent cyclase activity in the absence (Fig. 4, top) as opposed to the presence (Fig. 4, middle) of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 4, top) is not due to allosteric activation of NPR-A. Rather the stabilization effect of AMPPNP is simply more apparent under these conditions because of the diminished hormonal response of the dephosphorylated receptors. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time massive ATP-independent activation of guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptors. Also for the first time, we find that the AMPPNP-dependent increases in cyclase activities result from enzyme stabilization, not from receptor activation, as has been previously reported. These data call into question the current two-step allosteric activation model that suggests that the physiologic activation of these receptors requires ANP binding to their extracellular domains followed by ATP binding to their kinase homology domains. Instead, it suggests a single-step model in which natriuretic peptide binding in the absence of ATP is sufficient for maximal catalytic activation. ATP has now been shown to stabilize the activity of all members of the human transmembrane guanylyl cyclase family that have been tested.

However, the other ATP-regulated receptor guanylyl cyclases, GC-C and GC-E, completely lack this motif, suggesting that another region common to all four receptors either binds ATP directly or interacts with an ATP-binding regulatory protein.

For terminally misfolded glycoproteins, trimming of the oligosaccharide by the action of ER α-mannosidase I (ERManI) to generate a unique Man8GlcNAc2 isomer product (Fig. 1E) is the key rate-limiting initiation signal (9Wu Y.

Thus, the efficiency of creating fully folded glycoproteins for transport from the ER is defined by a competition between the kinetics of conformational maturation versus the rate of acquiring the key glycan signal for glycoprotein disposal. Many loss-of-function human genetic diseases result from delayed folding kinetics of potentially functional polypeptides, such as the ΔPhe508 mutant of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (21Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), rather than generating terminally misfolded protein structures (22Kleizen B. Braakman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Thus, treatment of many protein misfolding disorders could be achieved if pharmacological inhibition of the rate-determining steps for ERAD allowed sufficient time for completion of the protein folding process (7Ellgaard L.

ERManI is a member of a larger family of proteins, termed Class 1 mannosidases (24Moremen K. Ernst B. Hart G. Sinay P. Oligosaccharides in Chemistry and Biology: A Comprehensive Handbook. II.

The present models envisage recognition of the glycan structures by the EDEM proteins in a mode similar to substrate recognition during catalysis by the true hydrolases, followed by transfer to the Sec61 translocon pore, retrotranslocation into the cytosol, and proteasomal degradation (2Helenius A.

Thus, understanding how this family of enzymes and lectins accomplish their functions in recognition and catalysis will provide insights into the rate-limiting decisions between glycoprotein maturation and disposal in the secretory pathway.

Our recent studies suggest that the enzyme binds to the glycone residue in the -1 subsite in a high free energy 3S1 conformation (46Karaveg K. Siriwardena A. Tempel W. Liu Z.J. Glushka J. Wang B.C.

Novel general base (Glu599) and general acid (Glu330 and Arg334 acting in a through-water protonation scheme) functions were identified through a combination of kinetic analyses and structure determination of the ERManI-thiodisaccharide co-complex (Fig. 1, C and D) (46Karaveg K.

All of the known Class 1 mannosidase structures are essentially identical within the -1 and +1 subsites, suggesting that the catalytic mechanism for bond hydrolysis is conserved among all of the true hydrolases. Although all of the Class 1 mannosidases cleave Man-α1,2-Man linkages, there are significant differences in branch specificities among the different family members (24Moremen K. Ernst B. Hart G. Sinay P. Oligosaccharides in Chemistry and Biology: A Comprehensive Handbook. II. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 81-117Google Scholar). ERManI cleaves a single residue from the central branch of the Man9GlcNAc2 substrate to produce a single Man8GlcNAc2 isomer product (Fig. 1E) (39Herscovics A. Pinto B.M.

In contrast, the Golgi subfamily of enzymes recognizes the other terminal Man-α1,2-Man branches but instead cleaves the central branch with poor efficiency (48Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A.

Thus, these enzymes have a mutually exclusive but complementary specificity for the complete cleavage of Man-α1,2-Man linkages on high mannose glycans (41Tempel W. Karaveg K. Liu Z.J. Rose J.

In the studies described here, we have complemented and extended our recent work on the characterization of the ERManI catalytic mechanism (46Karaveg K. Siriwardena A. Tempel W. Liu Z.J. Glushka J.

Kinetic and binding analyses have allowed us to dissect the energetic contributions of individual amino acid residues and the protein-bound Ca2+ ion during substrate binding and catalysis. Through the use of a general acid catalytic mutant that is compromised in hydrolysis, yet maintains substrate binding with similar characteristics to the wild type enzyme, we also mapped the contributions of individual residues in the Man9GlcNAc2 substrate for their interactions with the extended enzyme glycan binding pocket. These studies revealed unanticipated roles for glycan interactions in the ≥ +1 subsites for facilitating catalysis and substrate specificity. The experimental strategy for the binding and kinetic analyses also provides a framework for further studies on the structural and energetic basis of substrate branch recognition and catalysis by other members of the class 1 (glycosylhydrolase family 47) α-mannosidases. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Human ERManI—The mutagenesis, expression, and purification of the human ERManI catalytic domain has been described previously (42Vallee F. Karaveg K.

Briefly, the cDNA encoding the human ERManI catalytic domain in the pPICZαA vector (Invitrogen) was used to perform site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmid constructs were then used to transform the Pichia pastoris strain X-33, and Zeocin-resistant colonies were screened for ERManI expression by performing Western blots using conditioned medium from induced cultures as described previously (42Vallee F.

Mutant enzymes were expressed in 1-liter shake flask cultures by induction in BMMY media, and the enzyme was purified from the conditioned media as described previously (42Vallee F. Karaveg K.

Glycopeptide and Glycan Isolation—Man9GlcNAc2-glycopeptides were isolated from crude soybean agglutinin by reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, elastase digestion, affinity chromatography using concanavalin A-Sepharose, and further purification by HPLC on a Cosmosil C18 column as described previously (46Karaveg K.

Man9GlcNAc2 was liberated from the peptide by peptide:N-glycosidase F digestion (50Sutton C.W. O'Neill J.A. Methods Mol.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Man8GlcNAc2-PA isomers, Man6GlcNAc2-PA, and Man5GlcNAc2-PA, were generated by digestion with either ERManI or Golgi ManIA and isolation by reverse phase HPLC as described (48Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Enzyme, Protein, and Carbohydrate Assays—The purified wild type and mutant enzymes were assayed for α1,2-mannosidase activity using Man9GlcNAc2-PA as substrate as described previously (46Karaveg K.

Briefly, the enzyme reactions (20 μl) were carried out in 96-well plates at 37 °C for the indicated times, stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and resolved and quantitated using a Hypersil APS-2 NH2-HPLC column (48Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that generates 1 μmol of Man8GlcNAc2 from Man9GlcNAc2 in 1 min at 37 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Oligosaccharide concentrations were determined by phenol-sulfuric acid assays (51Saha S.K. Brewer C.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 254: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Kinetic Analysis—Initial rates (v) for the enzymes were determined at various substrate concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 μm. The catalytic coefficient (kcat) and Michaelis constant (Km) values were determined by fitting initial rates to a Michaelis-Menten function by nonlinear regression analysis using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). kcat/Km values were derived from reciprocal plots of v and [S] where needed. In studies on the temperature dependence of catalysis, values for kcat were obtained between 5 and 40 °C at 5 °C intervals and were used to calculate activation energies (Ea) from the slopes (-Ea/R) of Arrhenius plots (ln(kcat) as a function of 1/T). The thermodynamic activation parameters were described by the Equations 1-3 (52Lonhienne T. Baise E. Feller G. Bouriotis V. Gerday C. Biochim. Biophys.

Calcium Equilibrium Analysis—Purified wild type ERManI or the T688A mutant was incubated with 200 mm EGTA for 2 h at 4 °C prior to desalting over a Sepharose G-25 column (1 × 40 cm), which was pretreated with 0.5 m EGTA, followed by pre-equilibration in calcium-free buffer (20 mm MES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl). The calcium-free protein solution was concentrated to 1 mg/ml using an Amicon YM-10 membrane. The calcium content of the protein solution, confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), was below 50 ppb. The total amount of calcium chloride required to generate defined concentrations of free Ca2+ ion (0-500 μm) in an EGTA-containing buffer (20 mm MES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA) was calculated using WEBMAXCLITE version 1.15 (54Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) (available online at www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/maxc.html). Solutions of defined Ca2+ ion concentration were prepared, and the pH of the mixture was monitored and adjusted to pH 7.0 by addition of NaOH. All stock solutions were prepared in EDTA-treated plasticware. Total calcium ion concentrations in each solution were confirmed by atomic absorption and used to recalculate the free calcium ion concentration under the conditions of analysis (55Potter J.D. Strang-Brown P. Walker P.L. Iida S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The calcium-free enzyme solution was diluted in calcium-free buffer to obtain a stock solution of 80 μg/ml for wild type ERManI and 140 μg/ml for the T688A mutant. Aliquots of the enzyme solutions (5 μl) were added to each of the buffers (10 μl) containing defined Ca2+ ion concentrations before addition of 5 μl of 80 μm Man9GlcNAc2-PA. Enzyme reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 1 h, stopped, and analyzed by NH2-HPLC chromatography as described above. Plotting of mannosidase enzyme activity versus Ca2+ ion concentration revealed a sigmoidal curve similar to data expected for a common equilibrium dialysis experiment, allowing the calculation of the Ca2+ affinity constant (KCa) by nonlinear regression analysis using Equation 4 (55Potter J.D. Strang-Brown P. Walker P.L. Iida S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar),y=nKCa[Ca2+]1+KCa[Ca2+](eq.4) where y is equal to the moles of Ca2+ bound per mol of enzyme, measured as units of α-mannosidase enzyme activity resulting from Ca2+ binding to the enzyme, and n is the apparent ERManI-specific activity. Binding Studies by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—SPR analyses were conducted using a Biacore 3000 apparatus (Biacore AB) with recombinant ERManI immobilized on the SPR chip surfaces at 25 °C by the amine-coupling method as described previously (46Karaveg K.

Specific inhibition of the two Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tor proteins by rapamycin alters many cellular processes and the expression of hundreds of genes. Among the regulated genes are those whose expression is activated by the GATA family transcription activator, Gln3. The extent of Gln3 phosphorylation has been thought to determine its intracellular localization, with phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms accumulating in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. Data presented here demonstrate that rapamycin and the glutamine synthetase inhibitor, methionine sulfoximine (MSX), although eliciting the same outcomes with respect to Gln3-Myc13 nuclear accumulation and nitrogen catabolite repression-sensitive transcription, generate diametrically opposite effects on Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation. MSX increases Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation and rapamycin decreases it. Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation levels are regulated by at least three mechanisms as follows: (i) depends on Snf1 kinase as observed during carbon starvation, (ii) is Snf1-independent as observed during both carbon starvation and MSX treatment, and (iii) is rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation. MSX and rapamycin act additively on Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation, but MSX clearly predominates. These results suggest that MSX- and rapamycin-inhibited proteins are more likely to function in separate regulatory pathways than they are to function tandemly in a single pathway as thought previously. Furthermore, as we and others have detected thus far, Gln3 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is not a demonstrably required step in achieving Gln3 nuclear localization and nitrogen catabolite repression-sensitive transcription in response to MSX or rapamycin treatment.

The observations that rapamycin induces Gln3 dephosphorylation and that this dephosphorylation depends on Sit4, a type-2A serine/threonine phosphatase regulated by Tor1/2, Tap42, and Tip41, further connected Gln3 intracellular localization to the upper portion of the Tor1/2 pathway (see Refs. 9Beck T.

Recently, treating cells with the glutamine synthetase inhibitor l-methionine sulfoximine (MSX) has been reported to increase Gln3 dephosphorylation, nuclear accumulation, and Gln3-activated transcription (32Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). MSX data also led to the conclusion that the nitrogen nutrient sensed by the Tor pathway is glutamine or a glutamine metabolite (32Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Overall, rapamycin treatment, nitrogen limitation, glutamine starvation, and MSX treatment all generate the same outcomes, nuclear localization of Gln3 and increased Gln3-mediated gene expression. In bare outline, the Tor pathway has been envisioned as glutamine levels positively regulating Tor1/2, which in turn positively regulates Tip41 and/or Tap42, the latter negatively regulating Sit4 phosphatase activity, preventing it from dephosphorylating Gln3, which thereby restricts Gln3 to the cytoplasm. Addition of either MSX, which inhibits production of the positive input signal sensed by Tor1/2 (glutamine), or rapamycin, which inhibits Tor1/2, frees Sit4 and perhaps a second type 2A phosphatase (Pph3) (16Bertram P.G.

Dephosphorylated Gln3, being capable of nuclear localization, can now function as a transcription activator (9Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 16Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.-F. Zheng X. F.S. J. Biol.

Both the Tor proteins and Snf1 phosphorylate Gln3 in vitro and interact with Gln3 in two-hybrid interaction and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (16Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C.

Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the actions of these kinases appear to regulate Gln3 localization differently. Tor1/2-dependent, i.e. rapamycin-sensitive, Gln3 phosphorylation correlates with its cytoplasmic localization, whereas Snf1-dependent Gln3 phosphorylation correlates with its nuclear accumulation during glucose starvation. Phosphorylation events regulated by the two kinases were concluded to be distinct because glucose starvation-induced Gln3 phosphorylation could be elicited in the presence of rapamycin (16Bertram P.G.

(i) The results of genetic studies with tap42 mutants are more consistent with the suggestion of Tap42 functioning as a positive rather than a negative regulator of Sit4 activity (7Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 8Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar 13Duvel K.

Cell. 2003; 14: 4342-4351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). (ii) Gln3 phosphorylation levels do not correlate with intracellular Gln3 localization in cells provided with a range of nitrogen sources and during nitrogen and carbon starvation in the same way as they do with rapamycin treatment (34Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). (iii) Nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated Gln3 during carbon starvation derives not from starvation for glucose but for nitrogen. Nitrogen starvation occurs because glucose-starved cells cannot produce the α-ketoglutarate needed to assimilate the nitrogen source (ammonia) used in the experiment. Therefore, both phosphorylated Gln3, generated by α-ketoglutarate-mediated nitrogen starvation, and dephosphorylated Gln3, in response to rapamycin addition, accumulate in the nucleus (35Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This occurs despite the fact that nitrogen starvation and rapamycin are both thought to regulate Gln3 through their inhibition of Tor1/2 (9Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 16Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.-F. Zheng X. F.S. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).This study was initiated in an effort to rectify instances in which the available data cited above are not congruent with expectations derived from the current model describing how the S. cerevisiae Tor proteins regulate Gln3. The report of MSX triggering dephosphorylation and nuclear localization of Gln3 provided a new way of perturbing Gln3 regulation (32Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and prompted us to employ MSX in our investigations. Here we confirm the earlier report that MSX treatment elicits nuclear localization of Gln3-Myc13 and high level NCR-sensitive gene expression. But to our surprise, MSX markedly increased rather than decreased Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation. Our results demonstrate Gln3-Myc13 phosphorylation occurs by at least two mechanisms: one is Snf1-dependent and the other Snf1-independent. MSX-induced Gln3 phosphorylation is Snf1-independent, whereas both mechanisms function to increase Gln3 phosphorylation during carbon starvation. Furthermore, the effects of MSX and rapamycin treatment on Gln3 phosphorylation are additive, but those of MSX clearly predominate. Although MSX and rapamycin treatment generate the same final outcome, nuclear localization of Gln3, the phosphorylation data are more consistent with MSX and rapamycin acting in parallel pathways to achieve that outcome than they are with their inhibiting tandem steps in a single regulatory pathway as proposed previously. These observations also suggest that something more or other than the Gln3 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation levels, detected thus far, determine the intracellular localization of Gln3.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains and Media—S. cerevisiae strains TB123 (MATa leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa, GLN3-Myc13[KanMX]) (10Shamji A.F. Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1574-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and RR181 (MATa leu2-3,112, ura3-52, rme1, trp1, his4, GAL+, HMLa GLN3-Myc13[KanMX] snf1::TRP1) were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.5) in YNB medium (without ammonium sulfate or amino acids), containing 2% glucose, the required auxotrophic supplements (120 μg/ml leucine, 20 μg/ml uracil, 20 μg/ml histidine, 20 μg/ml tryptophan, 20 μg/ml arginine), and the nitrogen source (0.1% final concentration) as indicated in the figure legends. Cells in Fig. 2B were cultured in SD medium prepared as described earlier (32Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 36Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Rapamycin (dissolved in 10% Tween 20 + 90% ethanol) was added to the cultures, where indicated, at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml. MSX (Sigma) was dissolved in water and added to the cultures, where indicated, at a final concentration of 2 mm. When yeast were transferred into carbon or nitrogen starvation media, the starvation media were pre-warmed, pre-aerated, and contained the required auxotrophic supplements.Strain Construction—Strain RR181 was constructed as follows. A fragment containing the SNF1 gene and its flanking sequences was amplified by high fidelity PCR (Stratagene PFU Turbo DNA polymerase) using DNA from TCY1 as template. An EcoRI-SpeI fragment from the PCR product was cloned into pBS(KS+), yielding pRR576. The 2.2-kb, SNF1-containing, PstI-HpaI fragment from pRR576 was replaced with the 0.8-kb, TRP1-containing, PstI-HpaI fragment from pRR496, yielding pRR578. The 1.7-kb EcoRI-SpeI fragment from pRR578 was used to transform strain TB123. Trp+ recombinants were selected by growth in minimal medium. Genomic Southern blot and mRNA analyses were used to confirm the presence of the snf1Δ in RR181.Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was isolated, and Northern blots were performed as described earlier (37Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 38Cox K.H. Pinchak A.B. Cooper T.G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Hybridization probes, other than that for SNF1, were described earlier (39Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36924-36933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The SNF1 probe was prepared by PCR, using primers 5′-AGCAGCCCAGATAACGATGAA-3′ and 5′-AATCCTCTTCAGATGGCTTGG-3′.Western Analysis—Cells were harvested in one of two ways. In the first method, the flask containing the culture was swirled in an ice-water bath for 1 min (9Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The culture was then transferred to a sterile 40-ml Nalgene tube, and the cells were pelleted at 3,000 rpm for 5 min (4 °C). The supernatant was removed; the cell pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of ice-cold protein extraction buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and a commercial mixture of protease inhibitors (Minicomplete, Roche Applied Science) (9Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 34Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and the cells were collected by centrifugation (30 s at 3000 rpm). The cells were resuspended in 200 μl of fresh, ice-cold extraction buffer and further processed as described earlier (34Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Alternatively, cells were harvested by filtration onto a type HA, 0.45-μm Millipore filter. Cells were quickly scraped from the filter, placed in a sterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and flash-frozen by submerging the microcentrifuge tube and cells in liquid nitrogen for 20-30 s. The total time for cell harvest was 45-50 s. The tube, still containing liquid nitrogen, was then quickly transferred to -80 °C until further processing of the cells was required. As with the centrifugation method, the frozen cells were resuspended in 200 μl of cold protein extraction buffer; cold glass beads were added, and the cells were processed as described by Cox et al. (34Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Except where otherwise indicated, cells were harvested throughout this work using the filtration flash-freezing method. Conditions of electrophoresis, immunochemical staining, and visualization were also as described earlier (34Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Although the method of cell harvest was not indicated in previous reports (9Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 16Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Ai W. Zeng C. Chan T.-F. Zheng X. F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35727-35733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the data presented are the same as we obtained when we harvested cells using the centrifugation method (34Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It may also be pertinent that centrifugation, along with chilling the cells on ice for ∼10 min, was used when cells in one report were transferred to new nutrient conditions (9Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar).In some experiments we observed spurious lane-to-lane variation in signal strength that we were unable to eliminate. Therefore, we felt it more prudent to assess the relative amounts of various species within a lane and to compare the pattern of data observed in that lane to the pattern observed in another lane than to compare quantitatively the amounts of specific Gln3 species observed in one lane to those in another. Also in many cases, control extracts derived from glutamine-grown cells were placed in the outside lanes of the gel as done earlier (34Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Phosphatase Treatment—Crude protein extracts were prepared as described above with the following extraction buffer: 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a commercial mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Extracts were incubated with 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) (Roche Applied Science) or 20 units of CIP + phosphatase inhibitor, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, for 15 (ammonia) or 30 min (urea) at 30 °C. Just prior to CIP addition, we added 0.9 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm ZnCl2 (final concentrations) to alleviate inhibition of CIP by EDTA that was present in the extraction buffer. Following incubation, samples were boiled 5 min and then loaded onto the gel. We noted that the presence of pyrophosphate in a sample adversely affected the strength of the immunofluorescent signal.Indirect Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described by Cox et al. (34Cox K.H. Kulkarni A. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10270-10278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

Analogously, MSX appears to be an even more useful perturbant for investigating control of Gln3. This inhibitor is more specific than rapamycin in that it altered nuclear localization of Gln3 and Rtg1 but not Gat1, Msn2, Msn4, and an unknown factor involved in the regulation of ribosomal protein gene expression (32Crespo J.L.

In the present study, we reveal that two scaffolding proteins, JIP1 and JIP3, have a cross-talk that leads to the regulation of the ASK1-SEK1-JNK signal during glucose deprivation. Glucose deprivation rapidly increases the interaction between ASK1 and JIP3, and the consequently activated ASK1 phosphorylates SEK1 on the Thr-261 residue. The activated SEK1 dissociates from JIP3 and phosphorylates JNK2 on the Tyr-185 residue. Phosphorylated JNK2 binds to JIP1, and the phosphorylation of the Thr-183 residue of JNK2 occurs. JNK2 phosphorylates JIP1 on the Thr-103 residue and leads to dissociation of Akt1 from JIP1. Dissociated Akt1 binds to SEK1 and ASK1 and inhibits their enzyme activity by phosphorylating SEK1 on the Ser-80 residue and ASK1 on the Ser-83 residue. Taken together, our data demonstrate that cross-talk between JIP3 and JIP1 is mediated through SEK1-JNK2 and Akt1.

Penninger J.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2838-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Their ubiquity and versatility raise the issue of how they achieve specific coupling of signal to cellular response (2Ho D.T. Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32662-32672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Most prominent among the known signal transduction pathways that control these events are the MAPK cascades, whose components are evolutionarily highly conserved in structure and organization, each cascade consisting of a module of three cytoplasmic kinases: a MAPK kinase kinase, a MAPK kinase, and the MAPK itself (3Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The control of diverse cellular processes in response to a plethora of extracellular stimuli by a few MAPKs lies in the fact that considerable specificity is built into MAPK activation and function (4Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4307) Google Scholar). There are two possible mechanisms that can operate in the cell. First, the protein kinase forming the MAPK signaling modules may interact via a series of sequential binary interactions to create a protein kinase cascade, or scaffold proteins may mediate signaling cascades by organizing the components of MAPK signaling into modules (5Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Scaffold proteins have been proposed to serve as organizing centers for signal transduction, and one function of scaffold proteins might be to reduce the extent of cross-talk between different pathways sharing molecular components (6Levchenko A. Bruck J. Sternberg P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5818-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that glucose deprivation activates the ASK1-MEK-MAPK signal transduction pathway. In this study, we hypothesized that the ASK1-MEK-MAPK signal transduction can be modulated through cross-talk between two scaffold proteins during prolonged glucose deprivation, as represented schematically in Fig. 12. The first scaffold protein, JIP3 (JNK-interacting protein 3, also named JSAP1 (JNK/SAPK-associated protein 1)), a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-binding protein (7Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), can be phosphorylated by ASK1, and its phosphorylation facilitates the recruitment of stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (SEK1), MKK7, and JNK into the JIP3-ASK1 signaling complex (8Matsuura H. Nishitoh H. Takeda K. Matsuzawa A. Amagasa T. Ito M. Yoshioka K. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40703-40709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The binding between JIP3 and JNKs (including JNK1, -2, and -3) is specific, whereas there is either no binding or very low binding of ERK2 and p38α to JIP3 (7Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S.

The second scaffold protein, JIP1, is a scaffold protein that integrates both positive and negative regulators of JNK.

In the present study, we observed that JNK activation was regulated by cross-talk between JIP3-associated proteins and JIP1-associated proteins during prolonged glucose deprivation. JIP3-mediated activation of SEK1 and JIP1-mediated restoration of Akt1 activity play an important role in the regulation of the ASK1-MEK-MAPK signal transduction pathway during prolonged glucose deprivation.Fig. 1Activation of JNK during glucose deprivation. DU-145 cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for various times (10–360 min).

Adenoviral Vector Construction—All recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by employing the Cre-lox recombination system (16Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The selective cell line CRE8 has an β-actin-based expression cassette driving a Cre recombinase gene with an N-terminal nuclear localization signal stably integrated into 293 cells. Transfections were done by using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). 5 × 105 cells were split into a 6-well plate 1 day before transfection. For the production of recombinant adenovirus, 2 μg of SfiI-digested Adlox/FLAG-JIP1, Adlox/FLAG-JIP3, Adlox/His-SEK1, Adlox/His-MKK7α1, Adlox/His-MKK7γ1, Adlox/His-MKK7γ2, Adlox/HA-JNK1, Adlox/HA-JNK2, or Adlox/HA-Akt1, ψ5 viral genomic DNA (2 μg) were co-transfected into CRE8 cells. The recombinant adenoviruses were generated by intermolecular homologous recombination between the shuttle vector and ψ5 viral DNA. The new virus had an intact packaging site and carried a recombinant gene. Plaques were harvested, analyzed, and purified. The insertion of various types of shuttle vector to adenovirus was confirmed by Western blot analysis, after infection of corresponding recombinant adenovirus into DU-145 cells. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to make point mutations in SEK1 protein. Threonine residue in mouse SEK1 was replaced with alanine (T259A). Sense primer oligonucleotide (5′-GACTCTATTGCCAAGGCAAGAGATGCTGGGTGT-3′) and antisense primer oligonucleotide (5′-ACACCCAGCATCTCTTGCCTTGGCAATAGAGTC-3′) were used for site-directed mutagenesis. PCR was prepared by adding 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 20 ng of double-stranded DNA template (pAdlox-His-SEK1), 125 ng of each sense primer, 125 ng of each antisense primer, 1 μl of dNTP mix, double-distilled water to a final volume of 50 μl, and 1 μlof Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (2.5 units/μl). PCR was performed with 14 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 7 min) with initial incubation at 95 °C for 30 s. Following temperature cycling, the reaction was placed on ice for 2 min to cool the reaction. After PCR, 1 μl of DpnI restriction enzyme (10 units/μl) was added directly to each amplification reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to digest the parental supercoiled double-stranded DNA. The DpnI-treated double-stranded DNA was transformed into Epicurian Coli XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Colonies were selected, and each plasmid (pAdlox-HA-JNK2) was sequenced using primer (5′-GGATGCTAACTTATGTCAGG-3′) to confirm mutation. RNA Interference by siRNA of SEK1, JIP1, or JIP3—To stably express siRNA for the long term knockdown, pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro vector (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) was used for clonal cell lines. The inserts for hairpin siRNA into pSilencer were prepared by annealing two oligonucleotides. For human SEK1 siRNA, the top strand sequence was 5′-GATCCACGCAAAGCACTGAAGTTGTTCAAGAGACAACTTCAGTGCTTTGCGTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′, and the bottom strand sequence was 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAACGCAAAGCACTGAAGTTGTCTCTTGAACAACTTCAGTGCTTTGCGTG-3′. For human JIP1 siRNA, the top strand sequence was 5′-GATCCGACCTCTCGGAGATCACTGTTCAAGAGACAGTGATCTCCGAGAGGTCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′, and the bottom strand sequence was 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGACCTCTCGGAGATCACTGTCTCTTGAACAGTGATCTCCGAGAGGTCG-3′. The annealed insert was cloned into pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro digested with BamHI and HindIII. The correct structure of pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro-SEK1 or pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro-JIP1 was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The resultant plasmid, pSilencer-SEK1 or pSilencer-JIP1, was transfected into DU-145 cells, and hygromycin B (250 μg/ml)-resistant cell clones were isolated. The interference of SEK1 or JIP1 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-SEK1 or anti-JIP1 antibody. To down-regulate the JIP3, JIP3 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. Cells were transfected with JIP3 siRNA and incubated for 36 h. The interference of JIP3 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-JIP3 antibody (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). Interaction between Proteins—To examine the interaction between ASK1 and JIP3/JIP1, adenoviruses expressing HA-tagged ASK1 (Ad.HA-ASK1) and FLAG-tagged JIP3/JIP1 (Ad.FLAG-JIP3 or JIP1) at an MOI of 10 were infected into DU-145 cells in 10-cm culture plates, respectively. For immunoprecipitation, after 48 h of infection, cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 80 μm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, and the lysates were incubated with 1 μg of anti-HA (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) or 3 μg of anti-FLAG M2 mouse IgG1 (Sigma) for 2 h. After the addition of protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the lysates were incubated for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with mouse anti-FLAG or mouse anti-HA (clone 12CA5; Roche Applied Science). Proteins in the membranes were then visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). To examine the interaction between SEK1/MKK7α1/JNK1 and JIP1/JIP3, anti-His antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. To examine the interaction between JNK2 and JIP1/JIP3, anti-HA antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. Immune Complex Kinase Assay—For in vitro kinase assay of Akt1, DU-145 cells were lysed in a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with mouse Akt antibody (Cell Signaling) and protein G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed twice with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture solution and washed once with the kinase buffer solution, and then they were subjected to kinase assays. To examine the Akt1 catalytic activity, GST-tagged fusion Bad protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a substrate of Akt1. 1 μg of Bad was incubated with immunoprecipitated Akt1 in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT, and 20 μm ATP at 30 °C for 1 h. Finally, the reaction was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Bad (Ser-136) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). For in vitro kinase assay of SEK1/ASK1 phosphorylation by Akt1, DU-145 cells were co-infected with Ad.His-SEK1/Ad.Myc-ASK1 and Ad.HA-Akt1 at an MOI of 10. After 48 h of infection, cells were incubated in glucose-free medium for 1 h and then lysed in a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-His/anti-Myc antibody and protein G-agarose. The beads were washed three times with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF and protein inhibitor mixture solution and washed once with the kinase buffer solution, and then they were subjected to kinase assays. 0.5 μg of GST-JNK/GST-SEK1 was incubated with immunoprecipitated His-SEK1/Myc-ASK1 in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT, and 20 μm ATP at 30 °C for 1 h. Finally, the reaction was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-ACTIVE JNK antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) or anti-phospho-SEK1 (Thr-261) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). For the in vitro kinase assay of JIP1 phosphorylation by JNK2, DU-145 cells were infected with various types of Ad.HA-JNK2 (wild type, T183A, and Y185F) at an MOI of 10. After 48 h of infection, cells were incubated in glucose-free medium for 1 h and then lysed in a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with rat anti-HA antibody and protein G-agarose. The beads were washed three times with a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and protein inhibitor mixture solution and washed once with the kinase buffer solution, and then they were subjected to kinase assays. 0.5 μg of GST-JIP1 or GST-JIP1 (T103A) was incubated with immunoprecipitated HA-JNK2 (WT, T183A, γ185F) in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT, 20 μm ATP, and 100 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 1 h. Finally, the reaction was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli buffer. Phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS under reducing conditions, and the proteins in the gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated with 7% (w/v) skim milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and then reacted with primary antibodies. After washing three times with PBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG. Then the proteins were detected with the ECL reagent. JNK Activation during Glucose Deprivation—We previously reported that glucose deprivation activates JNK. To examine the time course of JNK activation during glucose deprivation, DU-145 cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for various times (10–120 min). Fig. 1 shows that three isoforms of JNK (p43, p46, and p54) were phosphorylated during glucose deprivation. Phosphorylation of JNK occurred within 10–30 min, gradually increased until 60 min, and then decreased during glucose deprivation. We postulated that bistable systems in the cells are involved in the regulation of JNK activation during glucose deprivation. Bistability can result from cross-talking between scaffolding proteins. This possibility was further examined. Interaction between JIP3/JIP1 and ASK1-MEK-JNK Signaling Proteins during Glucose Deprivation—Previous studies have shown that JIP3 interacts with ASK1 (8Matsuura H. Nishitoh H. Takeda K. Matsuzawa A.

In this study, we investigated whether glucose deprivation promotes the interaction between JIP3 and ASK1. Fig. 2A shows that ASK1 associated with JIP3 in the presence of glucose. The interaction between these proteins gradually increased during glucose deprivation and reached a maximum at 1 h of glucose deprivation. This and the following experiments are compared diagrammatically in Table I. We further examined the interaction between JIP3 and downstream molecules (SEK1, MKK7α1, MKK7γ1, MKK7γ2, JNK1, and JNK2) of ASK1 signaling (Fig. 2, B–G). Interestingly, the kinetics of interaction between them during glucose deprivation were not identical. SEK1, MKK7α1, and JNK1 rapidly interacted with JIP3, reached a maximum at up to 30 min, and then dissociated from JIP3 during prolonged glucose deprivation (Fig. 2, B, C, and F). In contrast, little or no change in the interaction between JIP3 and MKK7γ1/JNK2 was observed in the presence or absence of glucose (Fig. 2, D and G). On the contrary, interaction between MKK7γ2 and JIP3 during glucose deprivation increased and reached a maximum within 10 min and then the interaction was sustained. We further investigated the interaction between the ASK1-MEK-JNK signaling proteins and JIP1, another scaffolding protein (Fig. 3). Interaction between JIP1 and ASK1/MKK7α1 during glucose deprivation increased and reached a maximum at 60 min and then the interaction was sustained. Interaction between MKK7γ2 and JIP1 during glucose deprivation rapidly increased and reached a maximum at 60 min and then the interaction was sustained. Interaction between JIP1 and MKK7γ1/JNK2 increased, reached a maximum within 30–60 min, and then decreased during glucose deprivation (Fig. 3, D and G). On the contrary, interaction between JIP1 and SEK1 or JNK1 was not detectable or not changed, respectively (Figs. 3, B and F). We summarized our observations in Table I. In this table, we have noticed that SEK1 and JNK2 were distinctively different from other proteins in terms of interacting with scaffolding proteins during glucose deprivation. Thus, we postulated that these proteins act as mediators for cross-talking between scaffolding proteins.Table ISummary of data from experiments shown in Figs. 2 and 3ASK1SEK1MKK7α1MKK7γ1MKK7γ2JNK1JNK2JIP30 min+--++++10 min+++++++++++30 min++++++++++++++60 min++++++-+++-+120 min++++-+++-+JIP10 min---+++++10 min---+++++++30 min+-+++++++++++60 min++-++-++++++++120 min++-++-++++++++ Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Interaction between JIP1 and various types of the ASK1-MEK-JNK signaling proteins during glucose deprivation.

After 48 h of infection, cells were exposed to glucose-free medium for various times (10–120 min). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody (A), anti-His antibody (B–F), or anti-HA antibody (G) and immunoblotted (WB) with anti-FLAG, anti-His, or anti-HA antibody (upper panels). The presence of HA-ASK1 or FLAG-JIP1 in the lysates was verified by immunoblotting (lower panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Role of JIP3 in the Activation of SEK1 and JNK during Glucose Deprivation—Data from Fig. 2 show the interaction between JIP3 and downstream molecules of ASK1 signaling. We hypothesized that this interaction is essential for activating downstream molecules of ASK1 signaling during glucose deprivation. To test this hypothesis, DU-145 cells were transfected with JIP3 siRNA or mock siRNA. Fig. 4 shows that the expression of JIP3 was effectively inhibited by siJIP3. Glucose deprivation-induced SEK1 and JNK activation were also inhibited in siJIP3-transfected cells. These results reveal that JIP3 plays an important role in activation of SEK1 and JNK. Role of ASK1 in the Interaction between JIP3 and SEK1 during Glucose Deprivation—Previous studies have shown that ASK1 phosphorylates JIP3 and its phosphorylation facilitates interactions of JIP3 with SEK1 (8Matsuura H.

To examine whether ASK1 has an effect on the interaction between JIP3 and SEK1 during glucose deprivation, cells were infected with adenoviral vector containing wild-type ASK1 (Fig. 5A) or mutant-type (kinase-inactive form) ASK1 (Fig. 5B) prior to glucose deprivation. Fig. 5 shows that glucose deprivation enhanced SEK1-JIP3 binding regardless of overexpressing either type of ASK1. SEK1 dissociated from JIP3 after 60 min of glucose deprivation in wild-type ASK1-overexpressed cells (Fig. 5A, lane 5). However, unlike overexpression of wild-type ASK1, overexpression of mutant type ASK1 prevented dissociation of SEK1 from JIP3 during prolonged glucose deprivation. We also observed that overexpression of wild-type ASK1 promoted JNK and SEK1 activation and sustained their activation during glucose deprivation (Fig. 5A). However, overexpression of mutant-type ASK1 suppressed JNK activation, and no detectable SEK1 phosphorylation on the Thr-261 residue was observed during glucose deprivation (Fig. 5B). We previously reported that glucose deprivation activates the ASK1-SEK1-JNK signal transduction pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that ASK1 kinase activity is not important for glucose deprivation-induced SEK1-JIP3 binding. Dissociation of activated (phosphorylated) SEK1 from JIP3 during prolonged glucose deprivation indicates that ASK1 kinase a"

Known L-selectin ligands include sulfated Lewis-type carbohydrates, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. Previously, we have shown that in situ detection of different types of L-selectin ligands is highly dependent on the tissue fixation protocol used. Here we use this knowledge to specifically examine the expression of L-selectin binding proteoglycans in normal mouse tissues. We show that L-selectin binding chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans are present in cartilage, whereas L-selectin binding heparan sulfate proteoglycans are present in spleen and kidney. Furthermore, we show that L-selectin only binds a subset of renal heparan sulfates, attached to a collagen type XVIII protein backbone and predominantly present in medullary tubular and vascular basement membranes. As L-selectin does not bind other renal heparan sulfate proteoglycans such as perlecan, agrin, and syndecan-4, and not all collagen type XVIII expressed in the kidney binds L-selectin, this indicates that there is a specific L-selectin binding domain on heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. Using an in vitro L-selectin binding assay, we studied the contribution of N-sulfation, O-sulfation, C5-epimerization, unsubstituted glucosamine residues, and chain length in L-selectin binding to heparan sulfate/heparin glycosaminoglycan chains. Based on our results and the accepted model of heparan sulfate domain organization, we propose a model for the interaction of L-selectin with heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. Interestingly, this opens the possibility of active regulation of L-selectin binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, e.g. under inflammatory conditions.

A well known function for L-selectin, a C-type lectin expressed on leukocytes, is its key role in the homing of lymphocytes to lymph nodes. This process involves the binding of L-selectin to its ligands expressed on high endothelial venules (HEVs), 1The abbreviations used are: HEV, high endothelial venule; CS, chondroitin sulfate; DS, dermatan sulfate; HS, heparan sulfate; KS, keratan sulfate; CSPG, CS proteoglycan; DSPG, DS proteoglycan; HSPG, HS proteoglycan; KSPG, KS proteoglycan; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; WB, wash buffer. which induces rolling of the lymphocytes and results in extravasation. L-selectin ligands on HEVs are well characterized and known to be mucin-like glycoproteins containing sulfated, sialylated, and fucosylated Lewis-related carbohydrate structures, which are expressed by the high endothelial cells (1Rosen S.D.

In addition to the lymph node, L-selectin ligands have been described to be expressed on endothelium under inflammatory conditions, including Crohn disease, asthma, heart and kidney acute allograft rejection, and a number of skin diseases (1Rosen S.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1013-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Rosen S.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 129-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In vitro studies show that, in addition to the well known Lewis-related glycoproteins, L-selectin can also bind to other types of molecules, including glycolipids and proteoglycans (3Norgard-Sumnicht K.E. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12012-12024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Koenig A. Norgard-Sumnicht K.E. Varki A. J. Clin.

Proteoglycans are glycoconjugates that consist of a core protein to which linear carbohydrate chains (glycosaminoglycans, GAGs) are linked. The composition of these GAGs is specific for the different types of proteoglycans, which are chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (DSPGs), heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPGs) (6Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Science. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin, which is an over-sulfated heparan sulfate, is produced by mast cells and stored in intracellular granules. A number of HSPGs, including perlecan, agrin, and collagen type XVIII, are important structural components of basement membranes in different tissues (7Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 8Erickson A.C. Couchman J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1291-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In addition, HSPGs are expressed on the cell surface, where they are involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Furthermore, depending on their sulfation pattern, HSPGs are able to bind and present many different proteins, including chemokines and growth factors (reviewed in Refs. 9Bernfield M. Götte M.

Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that L-selectin can bind to HSPGs and CSPGs isolated either from renal tissue or from a cell line (11Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K.

Although the identified proteoglycan ligands for L-selectin (collagen type XVIII and versican, respectively) are typically basement membrane or extracellular matrix components, in situ binding of L-selectin in these studies mainly detected intracellular ligands. Recently, we were able to show that in situ detection of different types of L-selectin ligands is highly dependent on the tissue section fixation protocol used (14Celie J.W.A.M. Beelen R.H.J. van den Born J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 298: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and that this is a likely explanation for this apparent discrepancy. In this study, we used this knowledge to specifically examine the expression of L-selectin binding proteoglycans in different normal mouse tissues. We showed that L-selectin binding proteoglycans are present in a number of different tissues, including the kidney. Using different proteoglycan knock-out mice, we identified the renal L-selectin binding HSPG and showed that a specific L-selectin binding domain on the HS GAG chain is involved. Finally, we identified a number of structural properties of HS/heparin chains that determine L-selectin binding. Combining these results with the well accepted model for HS domain organization enabled us to propose a model for L-selectin interaction with HS chains, under both normal and inflammatory conditions. Fusion Proteins and Enzymes—L-selectin-IgM, P-selectin-IgM, and E-selectin-IgM fusion proteins, consisting of the extracellular domain of human L-selectin, P-selectin, or E-selectin linked to human IgM Fc-tail, were secreted into OptiMeM (Invitrogen) by COS-7 cells after transfection with the corresponding plasmids (15Bistrup A.

Five-micrometer sections were cut and picked up onto gelatin-coated slides or Superfrost Plus slides (Menzel) in the case of enzymatic treatment and air-dried. Immunofluorescence—Cryostat tissue sections were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature (20 °C) and subsequently extensively washed using TBS (20 mm Tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, pH 7.4). Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated according to the routine histologic protocol using xylene/alcohol and subsequently extensively washed using TBS. Sialidase (0.5 units/ml), heparinase (0.5 units/ml), heparitinase I (0.05 units/ml), or chondroitinase ABC (5 units/ml) were diluted in acetate buffer (50 mm C2H3O2Na, 5 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 5 mm MgCl2·6H2O, pH 7.0 or pH 8.0, for chondroitinase ABC) and incubated on the sections for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber.

As secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 and goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 were used (Molecular Probes). In all experiments, controls for background staining were included by omission of primary antibodies or chimera and proved to be negative. L-selectin Binding Assay—Wells were coated overnight at room temperature with 50 μg/ml HS (isolated from human aorta according to Iverius (23Iverius P.H. Biochem. J. 1971; 124: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar)). After blocking with 5% dried skim milk (w/v) in TBS for 1 h at room temperature, wells were washed three times with WB. L-selectin-IgG (2.5 μg/ml in TBS + 1% (w/v) dried skim milk) was incubated with different concentrations of (chemically modified) polysaccharides for 10 min, transferred to the coated wells, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were washed, and biotinylated goat-anti-human IgG (1/250 dilution in WB; Sigma) was added and incubated for 1 h. After washing, wells were incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase (1/1000 in WB; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h and extensively washed. Substrate solution (2 mg/ml ortho-phenylene-diamine in 0.1 m citric acid, 0.2 m Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 5.5, + 0.03% H2O2) was added, and reaction was stopped after 30 min with 10% H2SO4.

N-Deacetylation was performed by hydrazinolysis as described previously (26Shaklee P.N. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). N-Acetylation of polysaccharides was performed by treatment with acetic anhydride as described by Danishefsky and Steiner (27Danishefsky I. Steiner H. Biochim. Biophys.

O-desulfated heparin was produced by N-sulfation (sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine) followed by N-acetylation of completely desulfated heparin. Unfractionated heparin was cleaved by deamination with HNO2 at pH 3.9, which results in selective cleavage at N-unsubstituted GlcN residues (30Pejler G. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Paulsson M.

Fraxiparin (molecular weight = ∼4500) was purchased from Sanofi Winthrop, Maassluis, the Netherlands, Fragmin (molecular weight = ∼6000) was purchased from Pharmacia & Upjohn, and Enoxaparin (molecular weight = ∼4500) was purchased from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Paris, France. L-selectin Ligands in Lymph Nodes—We previously were able to show that commonly used fixation protocols for frozen tissue sections can highly influence the in situ detection of L-selectin ligands (14Celie J.W.A.M. Beelen R.H.J. van den Born J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 298: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As we are interested in the expression and function of L-selectin binding proteoglycans, we set out to examine a panel of normal mouse tissues for the expression of L-selectin binding proteoglycans using formaldehyde-fixed frozen tissue sections, which enables visualization of L-selectin binding proteoglycans and glycoproteins. First of all, and as expected, L-selectin ligands were found on the HEVs in normal mouse lymph nodes. In addition, very strong granular staining of mast cells was observed (Fig. 1A). Double staining with an anti-IgE antibody, detecting mouse IgE bound to the mast cell IgE-receptor, confirmed the identity of these cells (data not shown). Next, we used different carbohydrate-degrading enzymes to determine the types of L-selectin ligands expressed. Pretreatment of the tissue sections with sialidase, which specifically removes sialic acid from a carbohydrate backbone, resulted in significantly decreased L-selectin-IgM-staining of HEVs, showing that binding of L-selectin to its ligands on HEVs is mainly sialic acid-dependent (Fig. 1, A and B). Staining of mast cells present in the lymph node tissue sections was unaffected by pretreatment with sialidase (Fig. 1B). However, pretreatment with heparinase, which specifically cleaves heparin, resulted in complete abrogation of L-selectin staining of mast cells (Fig. 1, C and D), showing that the L-selectin ligand present in mast cell granules is heparin. Binding of the L-selectin-IgM chimera to both HEVs and mast cells could be blocked upon the addition of L-selectin-blocking antibody DREG-56 or the calcium chelator EGTA (data not shown), indicating that the same carbohydrate binding site on L-selectin is involved in binding to these ligands. As controls, E-selectin-IgM and P-selectin-IgM chimeric proteins were used to determine specificity for L-selectin. E-selectin-IgM did bind to HEVs, as described previously (31Mebius R.E. Watson S.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3252-3260PubMed Google Scholar), but not to mast cells (data not shown). P-selectin-IgM did not bind to HEVs but did bind to mast cells (not shown). Together, these results indicated that the L-selectin-IgM chimera is a sensitive and specific probe to show the presence of different types of L-selectin ligands in tissues and that enzymatic treatment of the tissue sections can be used to unravel the identities of these ligands. Proteoglycans as Ligands for L-selectin—Next, we examined a panel of mouse tissues for the expression of L-selectin binding proteoglycans (Table I). In a number of tissues, including the small intestine and salivary gland, L-selectin ligands were detected, but binding was neither reduced by heparitinase I nor reduced by chondroitinase ABC, showing that these ligands are not proteoglycans. However, in a number of tissues, L-selectin binding proteoglycans were found. In cartilage, L-selectin binding was observed surrounding chondrocytes (Fig. 2A) and was shown to be chondroitinase ABC-sensitive (Fig. 2B). Heparitinase I pretreatment of the tissue sections had no significant effect on L-selectin binding (data not shown). This showed that L-selectin ligands found in cartilage are CS/DSPGs.Table IExpression of L-selectin ligands in normal mouse tissues L-selectin-ligand expression was examined by immunofluorescence staining using an L-selectin-IgM chimera on tissue sections. Enzymatic pretreatment of tissue section using heparitinase I or chondroitinase ABC (as described under “Experimental Methods”) was used to determine whether ligands expressed are proteoglycans. Controls for background staining were included in all experiments.Non-proteoglycan L-selectin ligandsL-selectin binding proteoglycansCervical lymph nodes+–Peyer's patches+–Mesenteric lymph nodes+–Salivary gland+–Stomach––Small intestine (duodenum, jejunum)––Small intestine (ileum)+–Colon––Liver––Spleen–+Kidney–+Brain––Lungs––Heart––Skin––Cartilage–+ Open table in a new tab Examination of the expression of L-selectin ligands in normal mouse spleen revealed a specific binding of the L-selectin-IgM chimera to vascular basement membranes in the spleen. Staining was located in the red pulp just outside the marginal zone (Fig. 2C) and was directly adjacent to endothelial cells (identified using the MECA-32 antibody directed against mouse endothelium; not shown). Furthermore, binding of L-selectin-IgM to these vascular basement membranes was shown to be sensitive to heparitinase I (Fig. 2D), whereas chondroitinase ABC pretreatment had no effect (data not shown), which shows that these ligands are heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In situ detection of L-selectin ligands in the mouse kidney revealed a very prominent staining of tubular basement membranes in the medulla (Fig. 2E). In addition, staining was observed associated with the vasa recta vascular bundles, in Bowman's capsule in the cortex, and in the papilla (not shown). The glomeruli were completely negative for L-selectin binding. Enzymatic digestion using heparitinase I significantly reduced staining in the papilla and completely abrogated staining in the medulla, cortex, and vasa recta vasculature, which indicates that the L-selectin ligands found are mainly HSPGs (Fig. 2F). Treatment of kidney tissue sections with sialidase had no effect on L-selectin-IgM staining, whereas chondroitinase ABC pretreatment slightly decreased staining in the papilla only (data not shown). These observations are in complete concordance with those observed in normal rat kidney (14Celie J.W.A.M. Beelen R.H.J. van den Born J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 298: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Identification of a Subset of Collagen Type XVIII as Renal L-selectin Ligand—As many of our antibodies directed against basement membrane HSPGs are generated in mice and recognize their epitopes in rat, we decided to perform the following experiments using normal rat kidneys. Various basement membrane HSPGs are present in normal mouse and rat kidney, including agrin, perlecan, and collagen type XVIII. All of these HSPGs have GAG chains to which L-selectin could potentially bind. Using an antibody directed against HS stubs (3G10) after heparitinase I treatment, all HS chains present in normal rat kidney can be visualized (Fig. 3, A and B). When comparing this staining with the L-selectin binding pattern of untreated sections (Fig. 3, C and D), it is clear that L-selectin binds only a subset of renal HS. Using antibodies directed against the protein cores of perlecan (Fig. 4A), agrin (Fig. 4B), and collagen type XVIII (Fig. 4C), it can be clearly shown that L-selectin binding partially colocalizes with agrin and collagen type XVIII, and to a lesser extent, with perlecan.Fig. 4Renal L-selectin ligands partially colocalize with perlecan, agrin and collagen type XVIII. Cryosections of normal rat kidney were stained using the L-selectin-IgM chimera (A–C; green fluorescence) and anti-perlecan (A; red fluorescence), anti-agrin (B; red fluorescence), or anti-collagen type XVIII (C; red fluorescence). Bar = 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further identify the L-selectin binding HSPGs, we stained kidney tissues from different knock-out mice. First of all, binding of L-selectin to kidney tissue sections of both CD44 and syndecan-4 knock-out mice was identical to that in wild type (data not shown). In Hspg2Δ3/Δ3 mutant mice, exon 3 of the perlecan gene is deleted, resulting in the loss of attachment sites for three of four potential HS chains (21Rossi M. Morita H. Sormunen R. Airenne S. Kreivi M. Wang L. Fukai N. Olsen B.R. Tryggvason K. Soininen R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In situ binding of the L-selectin-IgM chimera to kidneys of these mice also revealed a staining pattern identical to that of wild type (Fig. 5A). In contrast, L-selectin-IgM binding to kidney tissue sections of Col18a1-/- mice (20Fukai N. Eklund L. Marneros A.G. Oh S.P. Keene D.R. Tamarkin L. Niemela M. Ilves M. Li E. Pihlajaniemi T. Olsen B.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) was abrogated, with the exception of some residual staining in the papilla (Fig. 5B). The same results were obtained using kidney tissue of Hspg2Δ3/Δ3×Col18a1-/- double mutant mice, lacking both perlecan-HS chains and functional collagen type XVIII (21Rossi M. Morita H. Sormunen R. Airenne S. Kreivi M. Wang L. Fukai N. Olsen B.R. Tryggvason K. Soininen R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In these kidneys, no binding of the L-selectin chimera was observed (data not shown), with the exception of some residual staining in the papilla, which was heparitinase I-insensitive (not shown). Formally, we cannot exclude the possibility that due to the absence of collagen type XVIII in both the Col18a1-/- single mutant and Hspg2Δ3/Δ3×Col18a1-/- double mutant mice, the normal distribution of other HSPGs present in renal basement membranes was also disrupted. However, heparitinase I treatment followed by 3G10 staining (detecting HS stubs) of kidney tissue sections of both Col18a1-/- single mutant (Fig. 5D) and Hspg2Δ3/Δ3×Col18a1-/- double mutant mice (not shown) revealed that HS chains were present in the medullary basement membranes. Furthermore, the 3G10 staining of Col18a1-/- single mutant kidney appeared similar to that of Hspg2Δ3/Δ3 mutant kidney (Fig. 5C), to which L-selectin was able to bind. Together, these data showed that L-selectin selectively binds to heparan sulfate GAG chains expressed on collagen type XVIII in the renal medulla and cortex. Furthermore, there are certain structures in the kidney where collagen type XVIII is expressed, such as the glomerulus, but to which the L-selectin-IgM chimera cannot bind (Fig. 4C, single red staining). This indicated that not all collagen type XVIII molecules in the kidney express the heparan sulfate GAG chains to which L-selectin can bind. L-selectin Binds in Vitro to Heparin, CS-B, and Dextran Sulfate and Differentially to HS Isolated from Different Sources—As we have shown that L-selectin can bind to both CS/DSPGs and HSPGs in normal mouse tissue sections, we set up an in vitro L-selectin binding assay using a panel of different GAGs.

https://openalex.org/W1980334204,"Although human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) is imported into peroxisomes by a Pex5p-dependent pathway, the properties of its C-terminal tripeptide (KKL) are unlike those of any other type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1). We have previously suggested that AGT might possess ancillary targeting information that enables its unusual PTS1 to work. In this study, we have attempted to locate this information and to determine whether or not it is a characteristic of all vertebrate AGTs. Using the two-hybrid system, we show that human AGT interacts with human Pex5p in mammalian cells, but not yeast cells. Using (immuno)fluorescence microscopic analysis of the distribution of various constructs expressed in COS cells, we show the following. 1) The putative ancillary peroxisomal targeting information (PTS1A) in human AGT is located entirely within the smaller C-terminal structural domain of 110 amino acids, with the sequence between Val-324 and Ile-345 being the most likely candidate region. 2) The PTS1A is present in all mammalian AGTs studied (human, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and cat), but not amphibian AGT (Xenopus). 3) The PTS1A is necessary for peroxisomal import of human, rabbit, and cat AGTs, but not rat and guinea pig AGTs. We speculate that the internal PTS1A of human AGT works in concert with the C-terminal PTS1 by interacting with Pex5p indirectly with the aid of a yet-to-be-identified mammal-specific adaptor molecule. This interaction might reshape the tetratricopeptide repeat domain allosterically, enabling it to accept KKL as a functional PTS1.

Using (immuno)fluorescence microscopic analysis of the distribution of various constructs expressed in COS cells, we show the following. 1) The putative ancillary peroxisomal targeting information (PTS1A) in human AGT is located entirely within the smaller C-terminal structural domain of 110 amino acids, with the sequence between Val-324 and Ile-345 being the most likely candidate region. 2) The PTS1A is present in all mammalian AGTs studied (human, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, and cat), but not amphibian AGT (Xenopus). 3) The PTS1A is necessary for peroxisomal import of human, rabbit, and cat AGTs, but not rat and guinea pig AGTs. We speculate that the internal PTS1A of human AGT works in concert with the C-terminal PTS1 by interacting with Pex5p indirectly with the aid of a yet-to-be-identified mammal-specific adaptor molecule. This interaction might reshape the tetratricopeptide repeat domain allosterically, enabling it to accept KKL as a functional PTS1.

A deficiency of AGT, as occurs in the hereditary disease primary hyperoxaluria type 1, allows glyoxylate to be oxidized to oxalate instead. The resulting increased synthesis and excretion of oxalate leads to the deposition of insoluble calcium oxalate in the kidney and urinary tract and, ultimately, renal failure (1Danpure C.J.

AGT is normally peroxisomal in human liver, but in a subset of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 patients it is mistargeted to mitochondria (2Danpure C.J. Cooper P.J. Wise P.J. Jennings P.R. J.

Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal import of human AGT is dependent on the presence of the type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1) receptor Pex5p, but not the PTS2 receptor Pex7p (7Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B.

However, several features of the peroxisomal targeting of AGT are unusual when compared with the targeting of other peroxisomal proteins. The C-terminal tripeptide of human AGT is KKL (9Takada Y. Kaneko N. Esumi H. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which has a two-out-of-three match with the prototypical consensus PTS1 of (S/A/C)(K/R/H)(L/M) (10Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). KKL is necessary for peroxisomal targeting of human AGT but insufficient to direct the peroxisomal targeting of reporter proteins, such as bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or firefly luciferase (7Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Oatey P.B. Lumb M.J. Jennings P.R. Danpure C.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 652-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that additional targeting information may be necessary beyond that provided by the C-terminal tripeptide (7Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PTS1s are recognized by, and interact with, the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain located in the C-terminal part of Pex5p (13Van Der Leij I. Franse M.M. Elgersma Y. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Proc.

Commun. 1994; 204: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of human Pex5p bound to a synthetic hexapeptide ending in SKL showed that a small uncharged residue is required in the -3 position (15Gatto G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Lysine, which is the residue at -3 in human AGT, does not fit this description, being large and positively charged. Therefore, it is not surprising that human AGT does not appear to interact directly with human Pex5p in the yeast two-hybrid assay (8Knott T.G. Birdsey G.M. Sinclair K.E. Gallagher I.M. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, what is surprising is that the peroxisomal import of human AGT is still Pex5p-dependent (7Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although numerous tripeptides have been shown to be able to act as PTS1s, albeit in a highly context-dependent fashion, KKL has never been shown to either act as a PTS1 or interact directly with Pex5p (for example, see Refs. 16Lametschwandtner G.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1660-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, to our knowledge, KKL has not yet been found at the C terminus of any other peroxisomal protein. Further evidence that the human AGT PTS1 behaves very differently from other PTS1 sequences is shown by the observation that normal human AGT (ending in KKL) does not compete with other PTS1 proteins for peroxisomal import in a transient overexpression system, whereas mutated human AGT (ending in SKL) and GFP-SKL do (8Knott T.G. Birdsey G.M. Sinclair K.E. Gallagher I.M. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, the peroxisomal import of AGT-KKL, but not AGT-SKL or GFP-SKL, is markedly inhibited by overexpression of human Pex5p (8Knott T.G. Birdsey G.M. Sinclair K.E. Gallagher I.M. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unlike the C termini of most other PTS1 proteins, the C termini of mammalian AGTs are poorly conserved. For example, it is KKL in human (9Takada Y. Kaneko N. Esumi H. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and marmoset (20Purdue P.E.

Biochem. 1992; 207: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), NKL in rat (22Oda T. Miyajima H. Suzuki Y. Ichiyama A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), mouse (23Li X.M. Salido E.C. Shapiro L.J. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1999; 25: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and cat (24Lumb M.J. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), HKL in dog (EMBL accession number AAEX01037931/2, Canis familiaris chromosome 25 contig 37930/1), and SKL in cow (EMBL accession number AV605720, Bos taurus cDNA). This evolutionary variability differs from archetypal PTS1 proteins, such as urate oxidase, the C terminus of which (i.e. SRL) is conserved in rat, rabbit, mouse, pig, and baboon, or acyl-CoA oxidase, the C terminus of which (i.e. SKL) is conserved in rat, mouse, guinea pig, human, and koala. A complicating factor with AGT, but as far as we are aware no other peroxisomal protein, is that its intracellular compartmentalization varies between different mammalian species (25Birdsey G.M.

B. 2005; 272: 833-840PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in the human, rabbit, and guinea pig hepatocytes, AGT is peroxisomal. However, in the cat and dog, AGT is mainly mitochondrial with only a small proportion peroxisomal. In other mammals, such as marmoset and rat, AGT is more evenly distributed between both peroxisomes and mitochondria. Some non-mammalian vertebrates do not target AGT to peroxisomes at all. For example, in Xenopus laevis, AGT is mitochondrial and cytosolic. Interestingly, the C terminus of Xenopus AGT (i.e. KKM), although very similar to the KKL of human AGT, appears to be unable to act as a PTS1 (28Holbrook J.D. Danpure C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2336-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since the original discovery of the PTS1, it has become increasingly clear that a wide variety of tripeptides can target proteins to peroxisomes, albeit in a context-dependent manner. Context can be provided by the type of cell (particularly the species from which it is derived) or the nature of the cargo (i.e. the protein to be imported). In the case of the former, Pex5p from different species might have different PTS1 requirements (16Lametschwandtner G. Brocard C. Fransen M. Van Veldhoven P. Berger J. Hartig A. J. Biol.

Whereas in the case of the latter, amino acids in close proximity (i.e. within 10-20 residues) to the C-terminal tripeptide can markedly influence the properties of, and allowable residues within, the PTS1 (16Lametschwandtner G.

The importance of specific residues near the C terminus appears to be particularly important if the C-terminal tripeptide deviates from the conservative consensus PTS1 (16Lametschwandtner G. Brocard C. Fransen M. Van Veldhoven P. Berger J. Hartig A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33635-33643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, even the canonical PTS1 SKL can be inhibited by the close proximity of acidic amino acids (12Oatey P.B. Lumb M.J. Jennings P.R. Danpure C.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 652-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Human AGT is unusual in that the degeneracy of its PTS1 occurs in the same protein and cellular context. Human AGT can be targeted to peroxisomes not only by KKL, but also by all the other tripeptides found in mammalian AGTs (i.e. NKL, SQL, HRL, and SKL) as well as the glycosomal targeting sequence SSL (7Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, there are limits to the degeneracy of the allowable PTS1s in human AGT; SEL, DEL, LLL, and the Xenopus C terminus, KKM, do not work (7Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Holbrook J.D. Danpure C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2336-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although amino acids within the last 40 or so residues of human AGT were shown to be necessary for its peroxisomal targeting, they were still not sufficient for the peroxisomal targeting of reporter proteins (7Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. Jennings P.R. De Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Oatey P.B. Lumb M.J. Jennings P.R. Danpure C.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 652-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This suggests that any additional peroxisomal targeting information in human AGT must extend beyond the C-terminal 40 amino acids. Surprisingly, this extra information is evidently absent from Xenopus AGT, despite being 66% identical (and 75% similar) to human AGT. This was shown by the observation that, although cytosolic Xenopus AGT could be redirected to the peroxisomes if its C-terminal KKM was replaced by SKL, it could not if it was replaced by KKL (28Holbrook J.D. Danpure C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2336-2344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of the TPR domain of human Pex5p has been solved (15Gatto G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), the structures of very few of its cargo proteins have been determined. Therefore, it is not clear to what extent parts of the cargo, other than the C-terminal tripeptide, might interact with the import receptor and affect its function, particularly the acceptability of different C-terminal tripeptides as PTS1s. We have recently solved the crystal structure of human AGT to 2.5 Å and shown it to exist as an intimate dimer composed of two identical subunits, each of which can be divided into an N-terminal extension of about 20 amino acids, a large domain of about 260 amino acids containing most of the active site and the dimerization interface, and a smaller C-terminal domain of about 110 amino acids of uncertain function (36Zhang X. Roe S.M. Hou Y. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Pearl L.H. Danpure C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The structures of AGTs from other species are likely to be very similar to that of human AGT, thereby allowing the properties of their PTS1s to be analyzed in terms of the overall protein structure, rather than just in terms of polypeptide sequence. In the present study, we have attempted to localize the putative ancillary peroxisomal targeting information in human AGT by expression of a wide variety of AGT-GFP and interspecies AGT constructs in COS cells and determining their distribution by confocal (immuno)fluorescence microscopy. In addition, we have re-analyzed the interaction between human AGT and human Pex5p, using the mammalian two-hybrid system.

The 3′ primers additionally contained coding sequence for the desired C-terminal AGT oligopeptides (see Supplementary Materials). pEGFP.N3 (BD Biosciences) was used as template for PCR amplification of GFP for all GFP-oligopeptide constructs, except GFP-PKKKL for which the template was GFP-SKL (8Knott T.G.

Reverse primers used were P23 for GFP-CPKNKL, P24 for GFP-CPRHRL, P25 for GFP-PKSKL, P26 for GFP-CAQSQL, P27 for GFP-PKKKL, and P38 for GFP-CSRNKL. Each of these reverse primers was paired with the forward primer P22, which anneals upstream of the multiple cloning site in pEGFP.N3 or in the construct GFP-SKL. The resulting PCR products were digested with XbaI at the restriction site that was introduced by the reverse primers, and BamHI at the restriction site in the multiple cloning site downstream of the P22 primer. The resulting DNA sequence fragments were ligated into BamHI-XbaI-digested pcDNA3. GFP-AGT Constructs—GFP-HsAGT-KKL was made by first producing the intermediate construct pcDNA3.GFP as follows. The region coding for SKL in GFP-SKL was replaced by an XhoI restriction site by PCR amplification using primers P34 and P35. The PCR product was then subcloned into pcDNA3 using the restriction sites KpnI at the 5′ end and XbaI at the 3′ end (outside the newly constructed XhoI site in the insert) to give pcDNA3.GFP. Human AGT was amplified from the template pAGT (HsAGT-KKL in Bluescript KS+) (6Lumb M.J. Drake A.F. Danpure C.J. J. Biol.

In endothelial cells, Pg 2 regulates intracellular pH via Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) antiporters; however, this mechanism has not been demonstrated in any other cell type including prostate cancer cells. Because the Pg 2 receptor DPP IV is associated with NHE3 in kidney cell plasma membranes, we investigated a similar association in 1-LN human prostate cancer cells and a mechanistic explanation for changes in [Ca2+]i or pHi induced by Pg 2 in these cells. Our results suggest that the signaling cascade initiated by Pg 2 and its receptor proceeds via activation of phospholipase C, which promotes formation of inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, an inducer of Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum stores. Furthermore, our results suggest that Pg 2 may regulate pHi via an association with NHE3 linked to DPP IV in these cells. These associations suggest that Pg has the potential to simultaneously regulate calcium signaling pathways and Na+/H+ exchanges necessary for tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness.

We investigated a possible association of DPP IV with NHEs and a mechanistic explanation for changes in [Ca2+]i or pHi induced by Pg 2 in 1-LN cells. We found that interaction between Pg 2 and its receptor induces activation of phospholipase C (PLC), promoting the formation of inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which in turn stimulates release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores. We also found that Pg 2 may regulate pHi via an association with NHE3 linked to DPP IV in these cells. These associations have the potential to regulate simultaneously calcium signaling pathways and Na+/H+ exchanges necessary for tumor cell invasiveness. Materials—Culture media were from Invitrogen.

Polycarbonate filters (8-μm pore size; BD Biosciences) were coated with Matrigel® (12 μg/filter) and placed in a modified Boyden chamber. Cells (1 × 105) were added to the upper chamber in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing Pg 2 (0.1 μm) in the absence or presence of anti-NHE3 IgG or a control nonimmune rabbit IgG and incubated for 24 h in a humidified atmosphere. Following incubation, noninvading cells were removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab, and filters were excised and stained with Cyto-Quik® (Fisher). Cells on the lower surface of the filter were enumerated using an ocular micrometer. Five high-powered fields were counted. Each experiment was performed twice with triplicate samples. Measurements of Intracellular Free Ca2+ Concentrations and Cytosolic pH—1-LN [Ca2+]i was measured by digital imaging microscopy using the fluorescent indicator Fura-2/AM (27Gonzalez-Gronow M.

For measurements of pHi, 1-LN cells were incubated overnight in RMPI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum on glass coverslips and then washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 7.1. The cells were incubated for 20 min with 2 μm bis(carboxyethyl)-carbonyl fluorescein in HBSS, rinsed three times with buffer, and placed on the fluorescent microscope stage. pHi was measured by a digital video imaging technique in cells stimulated by the ligands, which were added after obtaining a stable base line (28Prpic V.

Then the cells were exposed to Pg 2 (0.1 μm) in HBSS for varying times at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the medium and adding a volume of 6.5% ice-cold perchloric acid. The cells were scraped and transferred to tubes containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 ml of octylamine. Then the suspension was centrifuged at 5,600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The upper phase was applied to a 1-ml packed Dowex resin column (AG1-X8, formate, Bio-Rad) and sequentially eluted in a batch fashion with 50, 200, 400, and 800 mm and 1.2 and 2.0 m ammonium formate containing 0.1 m formic acid, respectively. An aliquot of this mixture was used for determining radioactivity as described previously (29Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem.

Measurement of Cell-surface NHE3 Using a Cellular Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (CELISA)—Confluent monolayers of 1-LN cells grown in 96-well culture plates were gently rinsed in HBSS and then fixed for 5 min at 4 °C in freshly prepared 0.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Excess glutaraldehyde was washed away with PBS. The plate was then incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with 2% bovine serum albumin (200 μl) to saturate protein binding sites on the plastic. Wells in triplicate were then incubated with specific rabbit anti-NHE3 (Val275–Val290) IgG or nonimmune rabbit IgG in PBS (200 μl of a 0.5 μg/ml IgG solution) at 22 °C for 90 min followed by three rinses with PBS. Next, the cells were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (200 μl) of a solution containing 250 ng/ml secondary IgG). Bound IgG was monitored by hydrolysis of the alkaline phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate (2 mg/ml) at a wavelength of 405 nm using an Anthos Labtec® kinetic plate reader. Cell-surface NHE3 was expressed as ΔA405 nm/min. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—1-LN cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/ml on glass coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin with anti-DPP IV, anti-NHE3, anti-actin (negative control), or preimmune IgGs. Cells were washed and incubated at 4 °C with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 dye purchased from Molecular Probes-Invitrogen before washing and fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed by using an Olympus BX-60 microscope (Olympus, Lake Success, NY). Immunoprecipitation of DPP IV and NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3 from Plasma Membranes—1-LN cell monolayers from 5 × 150 cm2 were gently detached and washed twice with HBSS. After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, the cell pellet was suspended in HBSS buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm benzamidine, and 10 μm leupeptin. The cell suspension was transferred to chilled homogenizing tubes, and plasma membranes were isolated as described previously (31Misra U.K. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cell plasma membrane lysates were prepared by suspending the membranes in the above buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and passing the suspension through a syringe (22.5-gauge needle) six times followed by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C to remove particles in suspension. The supernatant was divided in five aliquots (200 μl), and each one was incubated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 22 °C followed by centrifugation and removal of the resin. The supernatant was then incubated with 10 μg of IgG anti-DPP IV, anti-NHE3 (Val275–Val290), or specific anti-NHE1, -NHE2, or -NHE3 in the presence of 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C with shaking. Then the mixtures were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in solubilization buffer and then prepared for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Protein samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar).

Sheets of nitrocellulose membranes containing transferred proteins were incubated first in a solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 80 in PBS for 1 h at 22 °C to block nonspecific binding of antibody followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C with specific rabbit anti-DPP IV or anti-NHE3 IgGs (1 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80 (PBS-Tween). The membranes were then washed three times in PBS-Tween and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Bound antibody was detected by incubating the membranes in PBS containing the horseradish peroxidase substrate 4-chloro-1-naphtol (1 mg/ml) and 0.01% (v/v) H2O2. Plasminogen Binding to Immobilized NHE3—Solubilized membrane aliquots (100 μl) were incubated with 10 μg anti-NHE3 IgG raised in rabbits against a 22-amino acid domain of human NHE3 (25Yoshioka S. Suzuki T. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) in the presence of 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads as described above. After separation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE and blocking of nonspecific sites, nitrocellulose membranes containing individual lanes were incubated with human Pg 2 (1 μm) in the absence or presence of 100 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA) in PBS-Tween at 4 °C overnight. After extensive rinsing in PBS-Tween, the membranes were incubated with an affinity-purified goat anti-human Pg IgG (1 μg/ml) at 22 °C for 3 h. A membrane containing a control lane was reacted with an anti-NHE3 (Val275–Val290) IgG. The membranes were then washed three times in PBS-Tween and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG. Bound antibody was detected as described above. Changes in [Ca2+]i in Response to Pg 2 Binding to the Surface of 1-LN Cells—Pg 2 (0.1 μm) added to 1-LN cells induces a transient rise in [Ca2+]i lasting about 90 s before returning to the base line (Fig. 1). Cells preincubated with the calcium chelator EGTA (1 mm) (Fig. 1) do not significantly influence the [Ca2+]i induced by Pg 2 (0. 1 μm); however, the rise in[Ca2+]i was almost completely abolished when cells were preincubated for 20 min with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (10 μm), which permeates the cell (34Tsien R.Y. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2396-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), prior to the addition of Pg 2 (0.1 μm) (Fig. 1A). These experiments suggest that Pg 2 induces calcium release from intracellular calcium stores, which are activated by signaling pathways initiated by cell-surface Pg 2 receptors. Because IP3 is responsible for the release of calcium from calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum, we studied the effect of Pg 2 receptor activation on IP3 generation. The results (Fig. 1B) indicate that there is a severalfold increase in IP3 formation in 1-LN cells stimulated with Pg 2 (0.1 μm). Next we assessed the effect of inhibitors of PLC, which hydrolyzes PIP2 into IP3 and diacylglycerol, on the rise of [Ca2+]i induced by Pg 2 on 1-LN cells. U-73122, a potent inhibitor of PLC activity, and generation of newly formed IP3 (35Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar) inhibit the rise of [Ca2+]i induced by Pg 2 (0.1 μm) (Fig. 3), whereas U-73343, a close analog that does not suppress PLC activity (24Praetorius J. Andreansen D. Jensen B.L. Ainsworth M.A. Friis U.G. Johansen T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G197-G206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), does not influence the Pg 2 effect (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data suggest that receptor activation leads to synthesis of IP3 followed by a rise in [Ca2+]i, primarily from intracellular calcium stores under our experimental conditions.Fig. 3Alignment of sequences of NHE1–6 homologous to amino acid residues containing Val275–Val290 in NHE3 and transmembrane topology model of these sequences. A, amino acid residues 275–290 of human NHE3, a candidate binding site for Pg 2A, were compared with homologous sequences in NHE1, -2, -4, -5, and -6. B, a hidden Markov model using the principles governing amino acid composition of integral membrane proteins was used to construct models of NHE1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 as described under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of the Mechanisms Involved in the Rise of pHi Induced by Pg 2 in 1-LN Cells—Pg 2 (0.1 μm) added to 1-LN cells induced a rise in pHi, which was continuous for 500 s (Fig. 2). In endothelial cells, a decrease in pHi induced by angiostatin, a Pg fragment, is mediated by NHE antiporters, which can be easily inhibited by amiloride analogs (36Wahl M.L. Owen C.S. Grant D.S. Endothelium. 2002; 9: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because DPP IV is a common receptor for Pg 2 and angiostatin on 1-LN cells (8Gonzalez-Gronow M. Grenett H.E. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that their effects on pHi may be mediated by the same NHE receptor. Preincubation of 1-LN cells with amiloride (100 nm) prior to addition of Pg 2 (0.1 μm) inhibits the rise in pHi (Fig. 2), suggesting that Pg 2 may regulate pHi in 1-LN cells via mechanisms involving NHE receptors. The association between DPP IV and NHE3 exists in kidneys (11Slimane T.A. Lenoir C. Bello V. Delaunay J.L. Goding J.W. Chwetzoff S. Maurice M. Fransen J.A.M. Trugnan G. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 270: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Choi J.Y. Shah M. Lee M.G. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Muallem S. Baum M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); however, a similar association has not been reported in other cell types. Our goal then was to determine whether NHE3 in association with DPP IV also serves as an additional receptor for Pg 2 on the 1-LN cell surface. Synthesis of an Antibody against a Cell-surface Epitope on NHE3—A hidden Markov model was used to search for the transmembrane topology corresponding to NHE3 (37Tusnády G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 38Tusnády G.E. Simon I. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). The membrane topology model predicts three outside loops in NHE3 (39Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9331-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including the amino acid segments Asn133–Thr142, Thr275–Phe291, and Asp427–Leu436. The sequence including Val275–Val290 (Fig. 3B) in the second outside loop of NHE3 contains one l-lysine residue (Lys280) flanked by two hydrophilic amino acids (Thr279 and His281) suggested a candidate binding site for Pg 2. A comparison of this primary amino acid sequence in NHE3 with similar sequences in other members of the NHE family (Fig. 3A), shows segments in NHE1, -2, and -5 with primary structural homologies greater than 60%, whereas NHE4 and NHE6 show only 50 and 35% homologies, respectively. A topology model comparing the second outside loop of NHE3 with homologous structures in NHE1, -2, -4, and -5 (Fig. 3B), predicts outside loops only in NHE2 and -5. However, only the outside loop in NHE5 contains a candidate binding site for Pg 2, l-Lys273. These comparisons suggest NHE3 as a unique receptor for Pg 2 in prostate cells because NHE5 is expressed solely in the brain (18Baird N.R. Orlowski J. Szabo E.Z. Zaun H.C. Schulteis P.J. Menon A.G.

Identification of NHE3 on 1-LN Cell Surface by CELISA and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The NHE3 peptide Val275–Val290 was synthesized and antibodies were prepared and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The anti-NHE3 IgG was then used as a reagent to assess the presence of NHE3 on the surface of 1-LN cells by CELISA and its possible association with DPP IV using immunoprecipitation techniques. Confluent cultures of 1-LN cells in 96-well culture plates were titrated with anti-NHE3 IgG and a control preimmune rabbit IgG (Fig. 4). The anti-NHE3 IgG binds to these cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas very little specific binding was observed with the nonimmune IgG, suggesting the presence of NHE3 in the 1-LN cell membrane. This experiment was validated by immunofluorescence microscopy studies in non-permeabilized 1-LN cells (Fig. 5). The cells were incubated first with anti-DPP IV (Fig. 5A), anti-NHE3 (Val275–Val290) (Fig. 5B), anti-actin (negative control) (Fig. 5C) or preimmune IgGs (Fig. 5D) followed by a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 dye, showing surface expression of both DPP IV and NHE3 on 1-LN cells.Fig. 5Immunofluorescence microscopy of DPP IV and NHE3 on 1-LN cell surface.

https://openalex.org/W1978191444,"ResT is the telomere resolvase of the spirochete <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, the causative agent of Lyme disease. ResT is an essential cellular function that processes replication intermediates to produce linear replicons terminated by covalently closed hairpin telomeres. ResT generates these hairpin telomeres in a reaction with mechanistic similarities to those catalyzed by type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases. We report here, that like most of the tyrosine recombinases, ResT requires interprotomer communication, likely in an in-line synapse, to activate reaction chemistry. Unlike the tyrosine recombinases, however, we infer that the cleavage and strand transfer reactions on the two sides of the replicated telomere occur nearly simultaneously. Nonetheless, the chemical steps of the forward and reverse reactions performed by ResT can occur in a non-concerted fashion (<i>i.e.</i> events on the two sides of the replicated telomere can occur independently). We propose that uncoupling of reaction completion on the two sides of the substrate is facilitated by an early commitment to hairpin formation that is imposed by the precleavage action of the hairpin binding module of the ResT active site."
https://openalex.org/W1970946409,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-containing complexes have been identified in different eukaryotes, and their existence has also been suggested in some Archaea. To investigate interactions involving aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in Archaea, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen for interactions between Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus proteins using prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) as the bait. Interacting proteins identified included components of methanogenesis, protein-modifying factors, and leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS). The association of ProRS with LeuRS was confirmed in vitro by native gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography. Determination of the steady-state kinetics of tRNAPro charging showed that the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of ProRS increased 5-fold in the complex with LeuRS compared with the free enzyme, whereas the Km for proline was unchanged. No significant changes in the steady-state kinetics of LeuRS aminoacylation were observed upon the addition of ProRS. These findings indicate that ProRS and LeuRS associate in M. thermautotrophicus and suggest that this interaction contributes to translational fidelity by enhancing tRNA aminoacylation by ProRS.

These findings indicate that ProRS and LeuRS associate in M. thermautotrophicus and suggest that this interaction contributes to translational fidelity by enhancing tRNA aminoacylation by ProRS. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole; HMD, H2-forming N5-N10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase; LeuRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase; ProRS, prolyl-tRNA synthetase; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole; HMD, H2-forming N5-N10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase; LeuRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase; ProRS, prolyl-tRNA synthetase; BSA, bovine serum albumin. are essential components of the translation process. Their cellular role is to ensure that individual tRNAs are attached to their cognate amino acid. Each aaRS specifically binds to a defined set of tRNAs and catalyzes the attachment of the amino acids to the tRNAs. Once synthesized, the aminoacyl-tRNAs function as substrates for ribosomal protein synthesis, thereby ensuring correct translation of the genetic code (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). In bacteria, aaRSs typically perform their role as individual enzymes, found either as monomers, homodimers, or homo- or heterotetramers. However, in eukaryotes several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases exist in multienzyme complexes (2Behrens C. Nielsen J.N. Fan X.J. Doisy X. Kim K.H. Prætorius-Ibba M. Nielsen P.E. Ibba M. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 9443-9449Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3Mirande M. Ibba M. Francklyn C.S. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 298-308Google Scholar, 4Wolfe C.L. Warrington J.A. Davis S. Green S. Norcum M.T. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2282-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and two different types have so far been found in mammalian cells. One is composed of only one aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, valyl-tRNA synthetase, and EF-1H, the heavy form of translation elongation factor 1 (5Bec G. Kerjan P. Waller J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2086-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complex is believed to contain seven subunits, two monomeric subunits of valyl-tRNA synthetase and the EF-1H subunits EF1-α, -β, -γ, and -δ in the molar ratio 2:1:1:1. The second complex described is considerably larger and includes nine aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities. The complex is composed of isoleucyl-, leucyl- (LeuRS), prolyl- (ProRS), methionyl-, glutaminyl-, glutamyl-, lysyl-, arginyl-, and aspartyl-tRNA synthetases. Whereas most of the aaRSs are present in the complex as monomers, data have indicated that lysyl-tRNA synthetase and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase exist as dimers (3Mirande M. Ibba M. Francklyn C.S. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 298-308Google Scholar, 6Lee S.W. Cho B.H. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, the polypeptide carrying the ProRS activity is multifunctional in that the protein also comprises the catalytic domain and activity of glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (7Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Three auxiliary proteins, p18, p38, and p43, are also part of the multisynthetase complex. Although the structural and functional significance of the complex still remains to be elucidated, it is known that N- and C-terminal extensions of the mammalian synthetases mediate association of the components. The accessory components p18, p38, and p43 assist complex formation and stability and promote tRNA binding by the complex (8Quevillon S. Robinson J.C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 9Quevillon S. Mirande M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W.

The heat shock protein Hsp90 has also been found to bind aaRSs of the complex (11Kang J. Kim T. Ko Y.G. Rho S.B. Park S.G. Kim M.J. Kwon H.J. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31682-31688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), an interaction believed to facilitate assembly.The only other multi-aaRS complex so far identified in eukaryotes was discovered in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The complex consists of methionyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, and the nonsynthetase protein Arc1p, which has homology to the mammalian protein p43 (12Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 13Deinert K. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Simos G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6000-6008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The association with Arc1p was shown to increase the catalytic efficiency of the two synthetases and enhances nuclear export of tRNA. The bacterial homologue of Arc1p, Trbp111, was first found in the extreme thermophile Aquifex aeolicus and was shown to promote tRNA binding by aaRSs (14Morales A.J. Swairjo M.A. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3475-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Nomanbhoy T. Morales A.J. Abraham A.T. Vortler C.S. Giege R. Schimmel P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Factors unrelated to the translation machinery have also been found to associate with aaRSs. In one case, a two-hybrid screen revealed interaction between yeast seryl-tRNA synthetase and Pex21p, a protein involved in peroxisome biogenesis (16Rocak S. Landeka I. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 214: 101-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar screen, yeast tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was isolated as a protein associating with Knr4p, a protein involved in regulation of cell wall assembly (17Dagkessamanskaia A. Martin-Yken H. Basmaji F. Briza P. Francois J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 200: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In Archaea, much less is known about aaRS complexes, and to date only two studies have reported their possible existence. Methanocaldococcus jannaschii ProRS was co-purified with the H2-forming N5-N10-methylene tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (HMD), a component of the methanogenesis pathway (18Lipman R.S. Chen J. Evilia C. Vitseva O. Hou Y.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7487-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ProRS and HMD were also used for co-immunoprecipitation experiments with recombinant proteins, leading to the proposal that HMD specifically interacts not only with ProRS but also with lysyl-tRNA synthetase and aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. The cellular role of the complex remains unclear, since the aaRS activities are unchanged upon complex formation. An aaRS complex has also been described in the extreme halophile Haloarcula marismortui, with many if not all of the aaRSs purified in one or possibly two large complexes (19Goldgur Y. Safro M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 32: 1075-1083PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigations of archaeal aaRS complexes are warranted, both to more clearly understand their role in these unusual organisms and also to better understand the role of such interactions in general. We have now used the yeast two-hybrid system to search for proteins interacting with ProRS in the archaeal methanogen Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (20Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. Harrison D. Hoang L. Keagle P. Lumm W. Pothier B. Qiu D. Spadafora R. Vicaire R. Wang Y. Wierzbowski J. Gibson R. Jiwani N. Caruso A. Bush D. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). This identified a stable interaction between LeuRS and ProRS, which appears to specifically enhance tRNAPro aminoacylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedia, Strains, and Plasmid Construction—Cloning procedures and Escherichia coli media were prepared by standard methods. Yeast transformation was done according to Ref. 21Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar. Yeast media were made according to the manual for the ProQuest two-hybrid system (Invitrogen) and as described (22Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2532) Google Scholar). All primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies. The bait vector pDBLeu, prey vector pDEST22, and yeast host strain MaV203 (MATα leu2–3, 112, trp 1–901, his3Δ200, ade2–101, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, SPAL10::URA3, GAL1::lacZ, HIS3UAS GAL1::HIS3@LYS2, can1R, cyh2R) were from the ProQuest two-hybrid system (Invitrogen). Construction of yeast two-hybrid bait vector containing the M. thermautotrophicus proS gene was done as follows. The ProRS-encoding gene, (proS, MTH611), was isolated by PCR using genomic M. thermautotrophicus DNA as template, the primers 5′-GGTGTTGTCGACCATGCAGAAACCTATC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGTGTCGACTCAGCTAATATGTTC-3′ flanked by SalI sites and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The proS PCR product was cloned into PCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and subsequently subcloned into the yeast ProQuest two-hybrid bait vector pDBLeu using the SalI restriction sites. The sequence obtained from verifying the proS clones deviated from the published MTH611 sequence in that it contained an extra C at position 1412. The C insertion in the sequence gave rise to a frameshift that then encoded the last nine amino acids of ProRS as YRAYLARTY instead of GLTLPEHIS (Stehlin et al. (23Stehlin C. Burke B. Yang F. Liu H. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8605-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) also reported LARTY as the five last amino acids).N-terminally tagged His6 fusion derivatives of ProRS and LeuRS (MTH1508) were made by PCR amplification of the relevant genes using oligonucleotide primers containing sequences encoding six histidine residues located immediately after the start codons of the genes (see below). Appropriate restriction sites used for cloning into final expression vectors were also included. Templates were either genomic DNA or plasmids containing the relevant genes. The PCR products were cloned into PCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced prior to cloning into the E. coli expression plasmid pET11a (Novagen). For the His6-ProRS construct, primers 5′-CATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACCAGAACCTATCAAA-3′ and 5′-TGATCATTAGCTAATATGTTC-3′ were used, and for His6-LeuRS, 5′-CATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACGATATTGAAAGAAAATGG-3′ and 5′-TGATCATTATTCAAGGTATATGGCTGGCT-3′ were used. Cloning into pET11a was done by isolating the respective NdeI-BclI fragments and ligating them into NdeI-BamHI-digested pET11a.Preparation of M. thermautotrophicus mRNA—Six cultures of M. thermautotrophicus were grown in 1.5-liter bioreactors at 55 °C in a minimal salts medium (24Morgan R.M. Pihl T.D. Nolling J. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 889-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A gas mixture of 89% H2, 11% CO2 was supplied to the cultures at a flow rate of 200 ml/min. The impellers on the fermentation vessels were spun at either 600 rpm to allow an optimum amount of hydrogen gas to dissolve into the medium or at 200 rpm to limit hydrogen dissolution. Eight RNA samples were purified from the six cultures under both high and low hydrogen conditions during early, middle, and late logarithmic growth phases. To extract the RNA, 10 ml of culture were withdrawn from the fermentation vessels into disposable Becton Dickinson syringes at each of the time points. The samples were then passed through reusable Gelman filter units containing Millipore nitrocellulose filters, 0.45-μm pore size. The filters were placed inside 2-ml screw cap vials containing 0.6 ml of 0.1-mm zirconia/silica beads; 0.6 ml of saturated phenol, pH 4.3; and 0.6 ml of 1% SDS, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The tubes were agitated inside a Mini-BeadBeater-8 cell disrupter (BioSpec Products, Inc.) for 5 min at 3,200 rpm. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was removed from each of the samples and extracted again with saturated phenol, pH 4.3. Nucleic acids were precipitated overnight with isopropyl alcohol and 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The pellets were washed with 75% ethanol, allowed to air-dry, and then resuspended in 50 μl of RNase-free distilled H2O. The samples were treated with DNase (amplification grade; Invitrogen) according to the supplier's instructions. RNA was further purified using a Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentrations of the samples were determined spectrophotometrically, and Northern blots were performed to check for degradation. 10 μg of total RNA from eight different samples were pooled (80 μg total) to provide templates for cDNA synthesis.Construction of M. thermautotrophicus cDNA-based Yeast Two-hybrid Library—cDNA library was generated by Christian Gruber and Mark Smith (Invitrogen) using random priming of M. thermautotrophicus total RNA. The cDNA was directionally cloned into the pDEST-22 vector. The resulting cDNA library contains 2.6 × 106 clones (representing >1000-fold coverage) with an average insert size of 0.4–2 kb.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—M. thermautotrophicus proS cloned in the yeast bait vector pDBLeu (ProQuest two-hybrid system; Invitrogen) was used to co-transform the yeast strain MaV203 with an M. thermautotrophicus cDNA library cloned into the prey vector pDEST22. Potential positive clones were selected by plating transformants on SC-Leu-Trp-His + 3-aminotriazole (3-AT; 10 mm) and incubating the plates at 30 °C for 3–10 days including replica cleaning as described (ProQuest two-hybrid system). The transformation plates were then replica-plated onto SC-Leu-Trp + 3-AT (10 and 25 mm) and incubated as above. Transformants showing consistent growth were streaked for single colonies, and from each transformant four colonies were retested for growth on SC-Leu-Trp-His + 10, 25, and 35 mm 3-AT and also tested for phenotypes of the other reporter genes (i.e. growth on SC-Leu-Trp-Ura and no growth on SC-Leu-Trp + 0.2% 5-fluoroorotic acid). A total of 2.8 × 105 transformants were screened, of which 90 were identified as positive interacting clones. Isolation of positive clones for sequencing was done by growing the co-transformants in SC-Trp followed by plating on SC-Trp in order to isolate colonies harboring only the prey vector. These colonies were tested for their inability to grow on media lacking leucine before prey plasmids were isolated from the cultures (25Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar) and inserts were sequenced. Prey vector cDNA inserts were sequenced using an oligonucleotide matching the part of the prey vector that reads into the 5′-end of the insert. In a few cases, oligonucleotides that surround the insert were used, so both the sequences in the 5′-end and the 3′-end of inserts could be determined.Protein Production and Purification—Production of His6-tagged ProRS and LeuRS was done by transforming BL21 (DE3) RP or RIL strains (Stratagene) with pET11 containing the relevant inserts and growing the resulting strains using the Overnight Express™ Autoinduction System 1 (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For His6-LeuRS, cell-free extract was prepared by sonication of the E. coli cells in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) followed by centrifugation at 27,000 rpm for 20 min. To minimize contamination with E. coli proteins, a flocculation step at 55 °C for 10 min was included prior to ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was then applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) equilibrated in lysis buffer and extensively washed in the same buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. His6-LeuRS was eluted in the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing His6-LeuRS (judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-PAGE) were pooled, and buffer was exchanged to buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) using a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). Samples were then concentrated and further purified to >95% purity by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra-15; 30-kDa cut-off). Aliquots were stored at –80 °C. Protein extract used to purify His6-ProRS was handled as described for LeuRS, except that the flocculation step was omitted. Fractions eluted and pooled from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column were diluted 5-fold in H2O and subjected to ultrafiltration as above. Samples were then diluted 5-fold in buffer A and applied to a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–500 mm) in the same buffer. Fractions containing ProRS (judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS-PAGE) were pooled and resubjected to ultrafiltration, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. ProRS prepared in this way was judged to be >95% pure. The concentrations of LeuRS and ProRS were determined by active site titration as previously described (26Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and the reaction was performed for 5 min.Native Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Attempts to visualize ProRS·LeuRS complexes by native PAGE were done by incubating a 1–2 μm concentration of each protein together in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C for 15 min (30-μl sample volume). Glycerol was added to the samples to a final concentration of 5% prior to loading on a 12% native polyacrylamide gel and run at 100 V for 16 h at 4 °C in native running buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, pH 8.5). Attempts to increase ProRS·LeuRS complex formation were made by incubating proteins at room temperature for 15–30 min combined with running gels at room temperature for 6 h at 100 V or for 16 h at 35 V. These changes did not result in increased visualization of protein-protein complex formation between ProRS and LeuRS. Western blotting was done in order to visualize the high molecular weight complex, as well as His6-LeuRS and His6-ProRS alone, by using antibodies against the epitope tag (tetra-His antibody; Qiagen), anti-mouse Ig horseradish peroxidase as second antibody (GE Healthcare), ECL plus Western blotting detection system, and hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare).Aminoacylation Assays—l-[U-14C]leucine (331 mCi/mmol), l-[U-14C]proline (276.5 mCi/mmol), and l-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline (85.0 Ci/mmol) were all from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The gene encoding M. thermautotrophicus tRNALeu (GAG anticodon) was cloned into pUC18, whereas the corresponding tRNAPro was a gift from D. Söll (Yale University). Synthesis and purification of the corresponding in vitro transcribed tRNAs was performed using standard procedures (27Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). All aminoacylations were performed at 50 °C as follows. A prereaction mixture was first prepared containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 125 mm dipotassium glutarate, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 6 μg/μl M. thermautotrophicus total tRNA (prepared as per Ref. 28Polycarpo C. Ambrogelly A. Ruan B. Tumbula-Hansen D. Ataide S.F. Ishitani R. Yokoyama S. Nureki O. Ibba M. Söll D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 287-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), or in vitro transcribed tRNA and aaRSs at the concentrations indicated for specific experiments. The entire mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, the appropriate radiolabeled amino acid was added, and the temperature was shifted to 50 °C. After 1 min, the reaction was started by the addition of 5 mm ATP. Aliquots were removed periodically and spotted onto 3MM filter disks presoaked in 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v) and then washed, and radioactivity was counted as described previously (29Hou Y.M. Westhof E. Giege R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6776-6780Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For Pro Km determination, l-[3H]Pro was added at concentrations varying between 0.2 and 5 times Km. For tRNAPro Km determination, tRNA was added at concentrations varying between 0.2 and 5 times the Km. Due to the relatively low activity of in vitro transcribed tRNALeu, saturation conditions could not be achieved, and kcat/Km was estimated directly (see “Results” for details).Size Exclusion Chromatography of aaRSs—Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superose 12 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in low salt (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10mm dithiothreitol) or high salt buffer (100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 125 mm dipotassium glutarate, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol). Both columns were calibrated using gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad). Samples were prepared in the same buffer and contained 1.4 μm His6-ProRS, 1.4 μm His6-LeuRS (both 100-μl injected sample volume), or a mixture of 2 μm His6-ProRS and 1.8 μm His6-LeuRS (200-μl injected sample volume).RESULTSIdentification of ProRS-interacting Proteins—The bait vector, pDBLeu, harboring the M. thermautotrophicus ProRS-encoding gene was used in the two-hybrid screen with a cDNA library cloned into the prey vector pDEST22. A total of 2.8 × 105 transformants were screened for protein-protein interacting phenotypes. Of those, 525 potential positive clones were retested for the protein-protein interacting phenotype, and 90 clones were selected for plasmid isolation and sequencing. Five clones, each identified once in the screen, contain genes involved in different steps in the methanogenesis pathway (MTH1159, MTH1160, MTH1163, MTH1300, and MTH1878; Table I). Two of four protein-modifying genes identified (MTH785 and MTH1623) appeared once, whereas the other two appeared eight times in total (MTH357 and MTH412). LeuRS (MTH1508) was identified once, and other proteins that are all subunits of protein complexes appeared either once (MTH736 and MTH802) or twice (MTH957 and MTH674).Table IProteins identified as interacting with M. thermautotrophicus ProRSFunctionOpen reading frameaORFs are numbered according to the annotated genome sequence of M. thermautotrophicus (20).DescriptionbPredicted functions of the corresponding proteins are taken from the TIGR Comprehensive Microbial Resource (available on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR2/CMRHomePage.spl).TranslationMTH1508Leucyl-tRNA synthetaseProtein modificationMTH357TransglutaminaseMTH412TransglutaminaseMTH785La proteaseMTH1623Oligosaccharyl transferase STT3MethanogenesisMTH1159N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:CoM methyltransferase, α-subunitMTH1160N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:CoM methyltransferase, β-subunitMTH1163N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin:CoM methyltransferase, E-subunitMTH1300Co-F420-reducing hydrogenase, a-subunitMTH1878CoB-CoM heterodisulfide reductase, C-subunitOtherMTH736Carbomoyl phosphate synthase large subunitMTH802Aspartokinase II α-subunitMTH957ATP synthaseMTH674Unknown functiona ORFs are numbered according to the annotated genome sequence of M. thermautotrophicus (20Smith D.R.

Open table in a new tab Potential ProRS-associating proteins identified from the two-hybrid screen were sorted into four subgroups (Table I). The first contained protein-modifying enzymes known to bind a large variety of proteins in the cell. The most abundant of these was a transglutaminase-like superfamily domain protein (MTH412) and its homologue (MTH357), both of which have been annotated as proteins involved in protein degradation. In addition, a putative La protease (MTH785) and an oligosaccharyl transferase STT3 subunit-related protein (MTH1623) were found, both of which act in modification or degradation of other proteins. All of the members of this group generally bind to many different proteins in the cell and thus are more likely to act as expected false positive clones rather than being proteins that specifically bind ProRS. The second major grouping contained three subunits from different multimeric proteins (MTH736, -802, and -957) and one protein of unknown function (MTH674). As with the first grouping, the finding that most of these proteins are normally expected to associate with other proteins suggests that they may also be false positive clones. The other large group of proteins identified in this study contains components of the methanogenesis pathway (MTH1159, -1160, -1163, -1300, and -1878). All of these proteins are known to be subunits of larger multimeric proteins and thus might be expected to readily associate with other proteins, perhaps as components of higher order complexes (e.g. see Ref. 30Mayer F. Rohde M. Salzmann M. Jussofie A. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1438-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only component of protein synthesis identified from the two-hybrid screen was LeuRS, a monomeric aaRS. Contact between ProRS and LeuRS has previously been observed in the human multi-aaRS complex (reviewed in Refs. 3Mirande M. Ibba M. Francklyn C.S. Cusack S. The Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2005: 298-308Google Scholar and 6Lee S.W. Cho B.H. Park S.G. Kim S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3725-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and the functional consequences of this interaction in Archaea were further characterized (see below). In light of the potential for nonspecific complex formation, the ability of proteins other than LeuRS to interact with ProRS was not further investigated.Association of ProRS with LeuRS—A gene fragment encoding the C-terminal 471 amino acids (residues 467–938) of LeuRS was isolated as a ProRS-interacting clone in the two-hybrid screen (Fig. 1 and Table II). In order to further investigate complex formation between ProRS and full-length LeuRS, both proteins were produced and purified heterologously as His6-amino-terminal fusion proteins. Complex formation was first monitored by native gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with His6-specific antibodies (Fig. 2). LeuRS and ProRS are easily detected and well resolved under the conditions employed here (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). When ProRS and LeuRS are incubated together prior to analysis, an additional species is observed with a slower mobility than either of the individual proteins (Fig. 2, lanes 3–5), suggesting that a complex is formed between the two proteins. Attempts to further increase the level of ProRS·LeuRS complexes by using a variety of different conditions were unsuccessful (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2013104458,"For thyroid hormone synthesis, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) molecules must be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum via the Golgi complex to be delivered at the cell surface to catalyze iodination of secreted thyroglobulin. Like other glycoproteins, TPO molecules in transit to the cell surface have the potential to acquire endoglycosidase H resistance as a consequence of Golgi-based modification of their <i>N</i>-linked carbohydrates, and measurement of the intracellular distribution of TPO has often relied on this assumption. To examine TPO surface distribution in thyrocyte cell lines, we prepared new antibodies against rat TPO. Antibody reactivity was first established upon expression of recombinant rat (r) TPO in 293 cells, which were heterogeneous for surface expression as determined by flow cytometry. By cell fractionation, surface rTPO fractionated distinctly from internal pools of TPO (that co-fractionate with calnexin), yet surface TPO molecules remained endoglycosidase H (endo H)-sensitive. Although the FRTL5 (and PC Cl3) rat thyrocyte cell line also exhibits almost no endo H-resistant TPO, much of the endogenous rTPO is localized to the cell surface by immunofluorescence. Similar results were obtained by fractionation of FRTL5 cell membranes on sucrose gradients. We conclude that in FRTL5 cells, a large fraction of rTPO is delivered to the plasma membrane yet does not acquire Golgi-type processing of its <i>N</i>-glycans. Rat and mouse thyroid tissue TPO also shows little or no endo H resistance, although cell fractionation still needs to be optimized for these tissues."
