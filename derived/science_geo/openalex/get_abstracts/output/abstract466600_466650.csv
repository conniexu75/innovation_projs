https://openalex.org/W2061058076,"Key cellular decisions, such as proliferation or growth arrest, typically occur at spatially defined locations within tissues. Loss of this spatial control is a hallmark of many diseases, including cancer. Yet, how these patterns are established is incompletely understood. Here, we report that physical and architectural features of a multicellular sheet inform cells about their proliferative capacity through mechanical regulation of YAP and TAZ, known mediators of Hippo signaling and organ growth. YAP/TAZ activity is confined to cells exposed to mechanical stresses, such as stretching, location at edges/curvatures contouring an epithelial sheet, or stiffness of the surrounding extracellular matrix. We identify the F-actin-capping/severing proteins Cofilin, CapZ, and Gelsolin as essential gatekeepers that limit YAP/TAZ activity in cells experiencing low mechanical stresses, including contact inhibition of proliferation. We propose that mechanical forces are overarching regulators of YAP/TAZ in multicellular contexts, setting responsiveness to Hippo, WNT, and GPCR signaling."

Evidence has been reported supporting regeneration via transplantation of multiple cell types, as well as replication of postmitotic cardiomyocytes. In addition, the adult myocardium harbors endogenous c-kitpos cardiac stem cells (eCSCs), whose relevance for regeneration is controversial. Here, using different rodent models of diffuse myocardial damage causing acute heart failure, we show that eCSCs restore cardiac function by regenerating lost cardiomyocytes. Ablation of the eCSC abolishes regeneration and functional recovery. The regenerative process is completely restored by replacing the ablated eCSCs with the progeny of one eCSC. eCSCs recovered from the host and recloned retain their regenerative potential in vivo and in vitro. After regeneration, selective suicide of these exogenous CSCs and their progeny abolishes regeneration, severely impairing ventricular performance. These data show that c-kitpos eCSCs are necessary and sufficient for the regeneration and repair of myocardial damage.

Most mammalian adult tissues harbor a subpopulation of tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells (hereafter referred together as stem cells) that differentiate into some or all of the parenchymal cells of their tissue of origin (Weissman, 2000Weissman I.L. Translating stem and progenitor cell biology to the clinic: barriers and opportunities.Science. 2000; 287: 1442-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Cardiac resident stem cells in embryonic, neonatal, and adult mammalian heart have been identified by different membrane markers (c-kit, Sca-1, Abcg-2, Flk-1, and PDGFR-α) and transcription factors (Isl-1, Nkx2.5, GATA4, and Wt-1) (Vincent and Buckingham, 2010Vincent S.D.

It is likely that a number of these identified cell populations represent different developmental and/or physiological stages of a unique resident stem cell (Ellison et al., 2010Ellison G.M.

Intensive research on the adult mammalian heart’s capacity for self-renewal has led to a consensus that new cardiomyocytes (hereinafter CMs) are indeed formed throughout adult mammalian life (Hsieh et al., 2007Hsieh P.C.

Buchholz B.A. Druid H. et al.Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans.Science. 2009; 324: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of this renewal, the origin of the new CMs, and the rate of adult CM turnover are still highly debated. Whereas some recent studies have calculated a yearly CM turnover of about 1% (Bergmann et al., 2009Bergmann O. Bhardwaj R.D. Bernard S. Zdunek S. Barnabé-Heider F. Walsh S. Zupicich J. Alkass K. Buchholz B.A. Druid H. et al.Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans.Science. 2009; 324: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar), others have calculated 4%–10% (Senyo et al., 2013Senyo S.E. Steinhauser M.L. Pizzimenti C.L. Yang V.K. Cai L. Wang M. Wu T.D. Guerquin-Kern J.L. Lechene C.P. Lee R.T. Mammalian heart renewal by pre-existing cardiomyocytes.Nature. 2013; 493: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar) and some as high as 40% per year (Kajstura et al., 2012Kajstura J. Rota M. Cappetta D. Ogórek B. Arranto C. Bai Y. Ferreira-Martins J. Signore S. Sanada F. Matsuda A. et al.Cardiomyogenesis in the aging and failing human heart.Circulation. 2012; 126: 1869-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similar discrepancy exists regarding the origin of the new CMs and their physiological significance. Myocyte replacement, particularly after injury, was originally attributed to differentiation of a stem cell compartment (Beltrami et al., 2003Beltrami A.P. Barlucchi L. Torella D. Baker M. Limana F. Chimenti S. Kasahara H. Rota M. Musso E. Urbanek K. et al.Adult cardiac stem cells are multipotent and support myocardial regeneration.Cell. 2003; 114: 763-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar), a source confirmed by genetic cell fate mapping (Hsieh et al., 2007Hsieh P.C.

Med. 2007; 13: 970-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that CMs in the border zone of an infarct are replaced by the division of pre-existing postmitotic myocytes (Senyo et al., 2013Senyo S.E. Steinhauser M.L. Pizzimenti C.L. Yang V.K. Cai L. Wang M. Wu T.D. Guerquin-Kern J.L. Lechene C.P. Lee R.T. Mammalian heart renewal by pre-existing cardiomyocytes.Nature. 2013; 493: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). These results would shift the target of regenerative therapy toward boosting mature CM cell-cycle re-entry. However, the experiments of Senyo et al., 2013Senyo S.E. Steinhauser M.L. Pizzimenti C.L. Yang V.K. Cai L. Wang M. Wu T.D. Guerquin-Kern J.L. Lechene C.P. Lee R.T. Mammalian heart renewal by pre-existing cardiomyocytes.Nature. 2013; 493: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar document that a very small fraction of CM DNA replication occurs in cells that have already activated the myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene, a well-known aspect of myocyte development; these data fall short of documenting mature myocyte re-entry into the cell cycle. The adult endogenous c-kitposCD45negtryptaseneg cardiac stem cells (hereafter, c-kitposeCSCs or just eCSCs) participate in adaptations to myocardial stress (Ellison et al., 2007aEllison G.M.

Urbanek K. et al.Adult cardiac stem cells are multipotent and support myocardial regeneration.Cell. 2003; 114: 763-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). Recently, the in situ myogenic potential of adult c-kitpos cardiac cells has been questioned as being significantly reduced, particularly in comparison to their neonatal counterparts (Zaruba et al., 2010Zaruba M.M. Soonpaa M. Reuter S. Field L.J.

Kotlikoff M.I. c-kit+ precursors support postinfarction myogenesis in the neonatal, but not adult, heart.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 13380-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To revisit the regenerative potential of c-kitpos eCSCs, we employed experimental protocols of severe diffuse myocardial damage which, unlike an experimental infarct, spares the eCSCs (Ellison et al., 2007bEllison G.M. Torella D. Karakikes I. Purushothaman S. Curcio A. Gasparri C. Indolfi C. Cable N.T. Goldspink D.F. Nadal-Ginard B. Acute beta-adrenergic overload produces myocyte damage through calcium leakage from the ryanodine receptor 2 but spares cardiac stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11397-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), in combination with several genetic murine models and cell transplantation approaches. Here, we demonstrated that eCSCs are necessary and sufficient for myocyte regeneration, leading to complete cellular, anatomical, and functional myocardial recovery. To follow c-kitposeCSC physiological response to cardiac injury, we induced severe diffuse myocardial damage in adult rats with a single high dose of isoproterenol (ISO) (Ellison et al., 2007bEllison G.M. Torella D. Karakikes I. Purushothaman S. Curcio A. Gasparri C. Indolfi C. Cable N.T. Goldspink D.F. Nadal-Ginard B.

Chem. 2007; 282: 11397-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). New cell formation was monitored with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling in vivo (Waring et al., 2012Waring C.D. Vicinanza C. Papalamprou A. Smith A.J. Purushothaman S. Goldspink D.F. Nadal-Ginard B. Torella D. Ellison G.M.

Heart J. 2012; https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehs338Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the presence of a patent coronary circulation, ISO produces a Takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy (Akashi et al., 2008Akashi Y.J. Goldstein D.S. Barbaro G. Ueyama T. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a new form of acute, reversible heart failure.Circulation. 2008; 118: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) with both diffuse subendocardial and apical CM death. This acute insult kills 8%–10% of the left ventricle (LV) CMs and results in overt acute heart failure (Ellison et al., 2007bEllison G.M. Torella D. Karakikes I. Purushothaman S. Curcio A. Gasparri C. Indolfi C. Cable N.T. Goldspink D.F. Nadal-Ginard B.

Chem. 2007; 282: 11397-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the myocardial damage and heart failure spontaneously reverse anatomically and functionally by 28 days (Figure S1 available online). Whereas in the normal myocardium (CTRL) most c-kitposeCSCs are quiescent (>90% BrdUneg and Ki67neg), after ISO damage, a high fraction enters the cell cycle (Figures 1A–1C and S1). At day 3, ∼88% are BrdUpos (Figure 1C), leading to an ∼8-fold increase in eCSC number, which decreases thereafter but remains above CTRL for up to 28 days (Figure 1A).Figure 1eCSC Activation and Myogenic Differentiation following Diffuse Myocardial DamageShow full caption(A–C) c-kitposeCSCs in myocardium (A), FACS cell-cycle analysis (B), and percentage of activated c-kitposBrdUposeCSCs (C) in CTRL and after ISO. ∗p < 0.01 versus CTRL.(D and E) Confocal microscopy (D) and quantification of c-kitpos/Nkx2.5pos progenitors (E; arrows) and myogenic precursor (arrowhead) 3 days after ISO.

All data are mean ± SD. See also Figure S1. The expansion of the eCSC pool in response to CM loss by ISO damage was followed by their commitment to myocardial cell lineages. Indeed, many of the c-kitpos eCSCs expressed GATA4 (Figure S1) and Nkx2.5 (Figures 1D and 1E), two early transcription factors of the cardiac lineage which, together with Tbx5 and MEF-2C, are essential for the differentiation of mesoderm and reprogramming of fibroblasts into the CM lineage (Takeuchi and Bruneau, 2009Takeuchi J.K.

Tallquist M.D. Neilson E.G. et al.Heart repair by reprogramming non-myocytes with cardiac transcription factors.Nature. 2012; 485: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The number of c-kitposNkx2.5posGATA4pos cells increased ∼4-fold over CTRL by day 3 (Figures 1E and S1). This sequential transition from undifferentiated cells to committed progeny is further illustrated by the transcription of sarcomeric and gap junction genes (troponin I, cTnI; connexin 43, Cnx43) and the presence of their corresponding proteins, even though at lower levels than found in the adult spared CMs (Figures 1D and S1). These new c-kitposGATA-4posNkx2.5pos myogenic progenitors express β-MHC, the isoform characteristic of the fetal rat heart (Lompré et al., 1984Lompré A.M. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Expression of the cardiac ventricular alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain genes is developmentally and hormonally regulated.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6437-6446PubMed Google Scholar). No expression of the α-Mhc gene, characteristic of adult rat CMs and expressed by spared CMs 72 hr after ISO, was detected (Figure S1). Starting at day 3 post-ISO, very small mononucleated BrdUposKi67pos CMs, including some in mitosis, were detected (Figures 1F–1L), which is indicative of immature, proliferative CMs. These new CMs were localized mainly in the LV subendocardium and apex, the area most severely damaged by ISO. From 3 to 28 days, there was a significant increase in the number (Figures 1H and 1I) and size of these CMs, which were nearly all mononucleated and smaller than the spared (BrdUneg) ones (Figure 1L). The BrdUpos CMs also expressed CNX43, suggestive of gap junction formation and integration with the neighboring myocardium (Figure 1J). Rod-shaped small BrdUpos CMs were also detected as single cells when isolated from ISO-treated hearts (Figure 1K). Their smaller size indicates that, despite the normal histology and function of the ISO-treated hearts 4 weeks postinjury, the newly regenerated CMs had not yet fully matured. BrdU labeling and Ki67 expression cannot establish whether the new CMs are generated by the reported division of pre-existing adult CMs or by the activation and ensuing differentiation of a stem cell compartment. To specifically address this issue, we traced the cell lineage of the new CMs. We generated double-transgenic mice (MerCreMer-ZEG) (Hsieh et al., 2007Hsieh P.C. Segers V.F. Davis M.E. MacGillivray C. Gannon J. Molkentin J.D. Robbins J. Lee R.T. Evidence from a genetic fate-mapping study that stem cells refresh adult mammalian cardiomyocytes after injury.Nat.

In tamoxifen-naive MerCreMer-ZEG mice, 99 ± 0.2% of the CMs express β-gal and are negative for GFP (the leakage of the Myh6-Cre construct in these animals is ∼0.2%). Tamoxifen correctly switched β-gal to GFP in CMs (Figures 2A–2C). This resulted in hearts composed of 83 ± 3% GFPpos and 17 ± 2% β-galpos CMs (Figures 2B and 2C), as previously reported (Hsieh et al., 2007Hsieh P.C. Segers V.F. Davis M.E. MacGillivray C. Gannon J. Molkentin J.D. Robbins J. Lee R.T. Evidence from a genetic fate-mapping study that stem cells refresh adult mammalian cardiomyocytes after injury.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 970-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, Senyo et al., 2013Senyo S.E. Steinhauser M.L. Pizzimenti C.L. Yang V.K. Cai L. Wang M. Wu T.D. Guerquin-Kern J.L. Lechene C.P. Lee R.T. Mammalian heart renewal by pre-existing cardiomyocytes.Nature. 2013; 493: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). In this setting, if new CMs (BrdUpos) originated from division of pre-existing CMs, they should be mostly GFPpos, and the ratio between GFPpos and β-galpos CMs should remain unchanged at ∼80/20. If instead the new CMs originate from non-CM cells, they should be β-galpos and produce a “dilution” of GFPpos CMs with a decrease of the GFPpos/β-galpos CM ratio (Figure 2A). In mice, ISO injection caused the same type of myocardial damage and LV dysfunction shown in rats, resulting in c-kitposeCSC activation, CM regeneration, and recovery of cardiac function (Figure S2). When ISO was administered to CM-recombined MerCreMer/ZEG mice (Figure 2A) followed by BrdU labeling, 28 days later there was a significant increase in the percentage of β-galpos CMs: 18% ± 2.5% in saline-treated mice versus 26.5 ± 2% in ISO-injured mice (Figures 2B and 2C), accompanied by a decrease of GFPpos CMs in the hearts of ISO-treated mice (73.5 ± 3.5%) compared to CTRL mice (82 ± 3.5%) (Figures 2B and 2C). There was also a concomitant increase of BrdUpos CMs (9 ± 2%) in the ISO-treated hearts, and these were β-galpos (Figures 2D and 2E). These numbers match the CM loss produced by ISO administration (Figure S2). In contrast, we detected very few newly generated BrdUposβ-galpos CMs (0.15 ± 0.05%) in saline-treated CTRL mice (Figure 2E). This result concurs with Hsieh et al., 2007Hsieh P.C. Segers V.F. Davis M.E. MacGillivray C. Gannon J. Molkentin J.D. Robbins J. Lee R.T. Evidence from a genetic fate-mapping study that stem cells refresh adult mammalian cardiomyocytes after injury.Nat.

Mammalian heart renewal by pre-existing cardiomyocytes.Nature. 2013; 493: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar using the same genetic tools. This discrepancy might be due to the different injury models used. In contrast to coronary ligation, ISO kills a large number of CMs in the presence of patent coronary circulation, and it spares the eCSCs. Thus, ISO provides a more physiologic test for the endogenous reparative potential of the adult heart (Ellison et al., 2007bEllison G.M. Torella D. Karakikes I. Purushothaman S. Curcio A. Gasparri C. Indolfi C. Cable N.T. Goldspink D.F. Nadal-Ginard B. Acute beta-adrenergic overload produces myocyte damage through calcium leakage from the ryanodine receptor 2 but spares cardiac stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11397-11409Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Furthermore, during the 2 week administration of tamoxifen for Cre induction, it would be expected that some eCSCs have committed to the myogenic lineage and activated the Myh6 gene with recombination of the transgene and generation of β-galpos CMs, as reported by Dong et al., 2012Dong F. Harvey J. Finan A. Weber K. Agarwal U. Penn M.S. Myocardial CXCR4 expression is required for mesenchymal stem cell mediated repair following acute myocardial infarction.Circulation. 2012; 126: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar. Although cell fusion might allow the expression of both GFP and β-gal in the same CM, it can be ruled out because the percentage of CMs positive for both markers was negligible (<0.1%) in saline-treated CTRL and ISO-injured mice. The possibility that the decrease in GFPpos and corresponding increase in β-galpos CMs after ISO might be due to a higher susceptibility of GFP-labeled CMs to ISO damage was also excluded by the fact that the percentage of necrotic and apoptotic GFPpos and β-galpos CMs 1 day after ISO was similar (Figure S2). Finally, we dissociated to single cells CMs from the hearts of double-transgenic MerCreMer:RYP mice obtained by crossing MerCreMer with R26R-EYFP (RYP) mice (Qian et al., 2012Qian L. Huang Y. Spencer C.I. Foley A. Vedantham V. Liu L. Conway S.J. Fu J.D. Srivastava D. In vivo reprogramming of murine cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes.Nature. 2012; 485: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar), in which the CMs were labeled with the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) upon tamoxifen injection. In agreement with the data shown on MerCreMer:ZEG mice, tamoxifen-driven induction of YFP marked ∼80% of endogenous CMs in the uninjured CTRL heart, which decreased to ∼72% in the apex (and subendocardium) of injured hearts at 28 days after ISO. Only the YFPneg fraction isolated from the CM-recombined double-transgenic mice was BrdUpos (Figure 2F). Most of these newly generated BrdUposYFPneg CMs were rod shaped, mononucleated, and smaller than the pre-existing (mostly binucleated) YFPposBrdUneg CMs (Figure 2F). In conclusion, after diffuse myocardial injury, new CMs are not generated (at least in quantities above background) through the division of pre-existing terminally differentiated CMs as claimed (Senyo et al., 2013Senyo S.E. Steinhauser M.L. Pizzimenti C.L. Yang V.K. Cai L. Wang M. Wu T.D. Guerquin-Kern J.L. Lechene C.P. Lee R.T.

Kajstura J. Chimenti S. Jakoniuk I. Anderson S.M. Li B. Pickel J. McKay R. Nadal-Ginard B.

To test this possibility, either saline or ISO was injected to sublethally γ-irradiated mice 3 months after successful reconstitution of their BM with BM cells from TgGFP mice (Sata et al., 2002Sata M. Saiura A. Kunisato A. Tojo A. Okada S. Tokuhisa T. Hirai H. Makuuchi M. Hirata Y. Nagai R. Hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into vascular cells that participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). In both CTRL and ISO-treated animals, a small fraction (3.5 ± 2% versus 5 ± 2%, respectively) of c-kitposCD45neg cardiac cells was GFP positive at 28 days (Figure 2G). However, despite extensive histological analysis and CM isolation, we were unable to find a single BM-derived GFPposBrdUpos or GFPpos CM in either ISO-treated or CTRL hearts (Figures 2H and 2I). Therefore, BM-derived cells do not directly contribute in any significant manner to new CM formation in normal or ISO-damaged hearts. To determine whether c-kitposeCSCs replenish the CMs lost by diffuse myocardial damage, we genetically tagged in situ a subset of adult resident c-kitposeCSCs and their myocyte committed progeny (Figure 3A). We generated a lentivirus carrying Cre-recombinase under the control of the c-kit promoter (Lenti-c-kit/Cre) with a pattern of expression restricted to c-kitpos cells (Figure S3; Cairns et al., 2003Cairns L.A.

To confine lentivirus release to the LV myocardium, we employed a fibrin-based PEGylated hydrogel for epicardial delivery (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang G. Wang X. Wang Z. Zhang J. Suggs L.

To increase delivery, we also injected the lentivirus directly into the apex, the region with the greatest CM damage after ISO (Ellison et al., 2007bEllison G.M. Torella D. Karakikes I.

https://openalex.org/W2024000011,"Cellular-state information between generations of developing cells may be propagated via regulatory regions. We report consistent patterns of gain and loss of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) as cells progress from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to terminal fates. DHS patterns alone convey rich information about cell fate and lineage relationships distinct from information conveyed by gene expression. Developing cells share a proportion of their DHS landscapes with ESCs; that proportion decreases continuously in each cell type as differentiation progresses, providing a quantitative benchmark of developmental maturity. Developmentally stable DHSs densely encode binding sites for transcription factors involved in autoregulatory feedback circuits. In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells extensively reactivate silenced ESC DHSs and those from developmental programs external to the cell lineage from which the malignancy derives. Our results point to changes in regulatory DNA landscapes as quantitative indicators of cell-fate transitions, lineage relationships, and dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2078455244,"During cell division, transcription factors (TFs) are removed from chromatin twice, during DNA synthesis and during condensation of chromosomes. How TFs can efficiently find their sites following these stages has been unclear. Here, we have analyzed the binding pattern of expressed TFs in human colorectal cancer cells. We find that binding of TFs is highly clustered and that the clusters are enriched in binding motifs for several major TF classes. Strikingly, almost all clusters are formed around cohesin, and loss of cohesin decreases both DNA accessibility and binding of TFs to clusters. We show that cohesin remains bound in S phase, holding the nascent sister chromatids together at the TF cluster sites. Furthermore, cohesin remains bound to the cluster sites when TFs are evicted in early M phase. These results suggest that cohesin-binding functions as a cellular memory that promotes re-establishment of TF clusters after DNA replication and chromatin condensation."
https://openalex.org/W2027694180,"Reporter genes integrated into the genome are a powerful tool to reveal effects of regulatory elements and local chromatin context on gene expression. However, so far such reporter assays have been of low throughput. Here, we describe a multiplexing approach for the parallel monitoring of transcriptional activity of thousands of randomly integrated reporters. More than 27,000 distinct reporter integrations in mouse embryonic stem cells, obtained with two different promoters, show ∼1,000-fold variation in expression levels. Data analysis indicates that lamina-associated domains act as attenuators of transcription, likely by reducing access of transcription factors to binding sites. Furthermore, chromatin compaction is predictive of reporter activity. We also found evidence for crosstalk between neighboring genes and estimate that enhancers can influence gene expression on average over ∼20 kb. The multiplexed reporter assay is highly flexible in design and can be modified to query a wide range of aspects of gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2102296842,"The complex anatomy of the epidermis contains multiple adult stem cell populations, but the extent to which they functionally overlap during homeostasis, wound healing, and tumor initiation remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that Lrig1(+ve) cells are highly proliferative epidermal stem cells. Long-term clonal analysis reveals that Lrig1(+ve) cells maintain the upper pilosebaceous unit, containing the infundibulum and sebaceous gland as independent compartments, but contribute to neither the hair follicle nor the interfollicular epidermis, which are maintained by distinct stem cell populations. In contrast, upon wounding, stem cell progeny from multiple compartments acquire lineage plasticity and make permanent contributions to regenerating tissue. We further show that oncogene activation in Lrig1(+ve) cells drives hyperplasia but requires auxiliary stimuli for tumor formation. In summary, our data demonstrate that epidermal stem cells are lineage restricted during homeostasis and suggest that compartmentalization may constitute a conserved mechanism underlying epithelial tissue maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2065923714,"Early embryonic patterning events are strikingly precise, a fact that appears incompatible with the stochastic gene expression observed across phyla. Using single-molecule mRNA quantification in Drosophila embryos, we determine the magnitude of fluctuations in the expression of four critical patterning genes. The accumulation of mRNAs is identical across genes and fluctuates by only ∼8% between neighboring nuclei, generating precise protein distributions. In contrast, transcribing loci exhibit an intrinsic noise of ∼45% independent of specific promoter-enhancer architecture or fluctuating inputs. Precise transcript distribution in the syncytium is recovered via straightforward spatiotemporal averaging, i.e., accumulation and diffusion of transcripts during nuclear cycles, without regulatory feedback. Common expression characteristics shared between genes suggest that fluctuations in mRNA production are context independent and are a fundamental property of transcription. The findings shed light on how the apparent paradox between stochastic transcription and developmental precision is resolved."
https://openalex.org/W2069891658,"Mononuclear phagocytes are classified as macrophages or dendritic cells (DCs) based on cell morphology, phenotype, or select functional properties. However, these attributes are not absolute and often overlap, leading to difficulties in cell-type identification. To circumvent this issue, we describe a mouse model to define DCs based on their ontogenetic descendence from a committed precursor. We show that precursors of mouse conventional DCs, but not other leukocytes, are marked by expression of DNGR-1. Genetic tracing of DNGR-1 expression history specifically marks cells traditionally ascribed to the DC lineage, and this restriction is maintained after inflammation. Notably, in some tissues, cells previously thought to be monocytes/macrophages are in fact descendants from DC precursors. These studies provide an in vivo model for fate mapping of DCs, distinguishing them from other leukocyte lineages, and thus help to unravel the functional complexity of the mononuclear phagocyte system."
https://openalex.org/W1967584365,"Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls growth and survival in response to metabolic cues. Oxidative stress affects mTORC1 via inhibitory and stimulatory inputs. Whereas downregulation of TSC1-TSC2 activates mTORC1 upon oxidative stress, the molecular mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition remains unknown. Here, we identify astrin as an essential negative mTORC1 regulator in the cellular stress response. Upon stress, astrin inhibits mTORC1 association and recruits the mTORC1 component raptor to stress granules (SGs), thereby preventing mTORC1-hyperactivation-induced apoptosis. In turn, balanced mTORC1 activity enables expression of stress factors. By identifying astrin as a direct molecular link between mTORC1, SG assembly, and the stress response, we establish a unifying model of mTORC1 inhibition and activation upon stress. Importantly, we show that in cancer cells, apoptosis suppression during stress depends on astrin. Being frequently upregulated in tumors, astrin is a potential clinically relevant target to sensitize tumors to apoptosis."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra, a region in the midbrain that is critical for motor control (Lang and Lozano, 1998Lang A.E.

PINK1 plays an important role in repairing mitochondrial dysfunction by responding to damage at the level of individual mitochondria. In healthy mitochondria, PINK1 is rapidly degraded by the protease ParL (Meissner et al., 2011Meissner C. Lorenz H. Weihofen A. Selkoe D.J. Lemberg M.K.

Recent work has shown that, of 17 clinically relevant PINK1 mutations, those mutants that affect catalytic activity but do not affect cleavage or subcellular localization have the most dramatic effect on neuron viability, further supporting a role for PINK1 activity in the prevention of neurodegeneration (Song et al., 2013Song S.

Chem. 2013; 288: 5660-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One of the most common of the catalytic mutants, PINK1G309D, shows an ∼70% decrease in kinase activity and abrogates the neuroprotective effect of PINK1 (Petit et al., 2005Petit A. Kawarai T.

PINK1 protects against oxidative stress by phosphorylating mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e172Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). However, lower PINKG309D catalytic activity can be rescued by overexpression of PINK1WT, and increasing PINK1 activity by PINK1WT overexpression has been shown to reduce staurosporine- and oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis in multiple cell lines, suggesting that enhanced PINK1 activity could be an effective therapeutic strategy for PD (Arena et al., 2013Arena G.

Recognizing the therapeutic potential of PINK1/Parkin pathway activation, we began investigating mechanisms for the pharmacological activation of PINK1. Small-molecule activation of kinases is typically accomplished by binding allosteric regulatory sites. For example, natural products such as phorbol esters bind to the lipid-binding domain of PKCs and recruit the kinase to the membrane (Castagna et al., 1982Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K.

The role of protein kinase C in cell surface signal transduction and tumour promotion.Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (5757) Google Scholar); separately, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated by binding of AMP to an allosteric site (Ferrer et al., 1985Ferrer A. Caelles C. Massot N. Hegardt F.G. Activation of rat liver cytosolic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase by adenosine 5′-monophosphate.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Another potential strategy might involve manipulation of protein interaction sites or the active site, given that synthetic ligands have been identified that bind to the protein docking sites on the kinase PDK1 (Hindie et al., 2009Hindie V. Stroba A. Zhang H. Lopez-Garcia L.A. Idrissova L. Zeuzem S. Hirschberg D. Schaeffer F. Jørgensen T.J.

However, these approaches were not applicable to PINK1 as no structural data for PINK1 are available. We next turned our attention to sites within PINK1 known to alter its function or stability. Four PINK1 disease-associated mutations, including G309D, occur in an unusual insertion in the canonical kinase fold.

Inserts in the active site of several enzymes have been shown to alter substrate specificity. In one example, the deubiquitinase UCH-L5 can hydrolyze larger ubiquitin chains only when a >14 AA loop is present in the active site (Zhou et al., 2012Zhou Z.R. Zhang Y.H. Liu S. Song A.X. Hu H.Y. Length of the active-site crossover loop defines the substrate specificity of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases for ubiquitin chains.Biochem. J. 2012; 441: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In another example, protein engineering of alkyl guanine DNA alkyltransferase through insertion of a loop into the active site allows for recognition of an enlarged O6-modified guanine substrate not accepted by the enzyme without the loop insertion (Heinis et al., 2006Heinis C. Schmitt S. Kindermann M. Godin G. Johnsson K. Evolving the substrate specificity of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase through loop insertion for applications in molecular imaging.ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, the three insertions in PINK1’s adenine-binding N-terminal subdomain led us to believe that PINK1 might also exhibit altered substrate specificity. In considering the possibility that nucleotides other than ATP could be substrates for kinases, we noticed that CK2 can utilize multiple substrates as phospho-donors—guanosine triphosphate (GTP) as well as ATP, though its activity with GTP is much lower (Niefind et al., 1999Niefind K. Pütter M. Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Schomburg D. GTP plus water mimic ATP in the active site of protein kinase CK2.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Though it is uncommon for eukaryotic protein kinases to accept alternative substrates in the ATP binding site, kinases engineered with a single mutation to the gatekeeper residue often tolerate ATP analogs with substitutions at the N6 position (Liu et al., 1998bLiu Y.

USA. 1997; 94: 3565-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Importantly, no wild-type (WT) kinase we had previously studied had shown the ability to accept N6-modified ATP analogs (Figure S1B). We discovered that, unlike any kinase we have studied, PINK1 accepts the neo-substrate N6 furfuryl ATP (kinetin triphosphate, KTP) with higher catalytic efficiency than its endogenous substrate, ATP. We also found that the metabolic precursor of this neo-substrate (kinetin) can be taken up by cells and converted to the nucleotide triphosphate form, which leads to accelerated Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria, diminished mitochondrial motility in axons, and suppression of apoptosis in human-derived neural cells, all in a PINK1-dependent manner. We expressed both PINK1WT and PINK1G309D GST-tagged kinase domains (156–496PINK1) in E. coli (Figure S2A) and performed kinase assays with a series of neo-substrate analogs. As expected, PINK1G309D displayed reduced activity with ATP; interestingly, however, incubation with N6 furfuryl ATP (KTP) (Figure 1A) led to increased levels of transphosphorylation of the mitochondrial chaperone hTRAP1 (residues 60–704) (Figure 1B) and autophosphorylation with both PINK1G309D and PINK1WT (Figures 1C and 1D).

See also Figures S1 and S2. PINK1 is intrinsically highly unstable, especially so when produced in bacteria (Beilina et al., 2005Beilina A. Van Der Brug M. Ahmad R. Kesavapany S. Miller D.W. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 associated with recessive parkinsonism have differential effects on protein stability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 5703-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar); therefore, in order to confirm the PINK1 dependency of the observed kinase activity, we took several steps to optimize PINK1 expression. We constructed several FLAG3-tagged truncation variants of PINK1 and induced expression using baculovirus-infected SF21 insect cells (Figure S2B). C-terminally tagged 112–581PINK1FLAG3 expressed the most soluble protein. However, the amount was far below what we required for biochemical characterization (Figure S2C). Hypothesizing that PINK1 might require interaction with other proteins to fold properly, we coexpressed proteins known to associate with PINK1, such as DJ-1, Parkin, and TRAP1. Coexpression of full-length TRAP1 dramatically increased the stability of PINK1 (Figure S2C). This finding enabled us to express larger amounts of properly folded PINK1WT, PINK1G309D, and a kinase-dead PINK1kddd (residues 112–581 with K219A, D362A, and D384A [Figure S1A]). In line with our initial observations, SF21-produced-PINK1 activity is also enhanced using KTP, but not other nucleotides (Figure 1F). We confirmed that PINK1kddd has severely compromised activity (Figures 1G and S2D) and were able to show that PINK1WT could autophosphorylate with a 3.9 ± 1.3-fold higher (p = 0.02; t test) Vmax and a higher KM (27.9 ± 4.9 μM versus 74.6 ± 13.2 μM) for the neo-substrate KTP versus ATP (Figures 1G, S2E, and S2F). As the previous assays utilized ATP with a γ-thiophosphate as a tracer, we wanted to confirm the activity using an orthogonal tracer, γ-32P ATP, to visualize PINK1 activity. Therefore, we generated KTP with a γ-32P-labeled phosphate and were able to see that, using this orthogonally labeled version of KTP, PINK1WT transphosphorylation of 60–704TRAP1 is increased relative to γ-32P ATP (Figure S2G). Because KTP would have to compete with millimolar intracellular ATP concentrations in order to function, we performed a competition assay with γ-thiophosphate-labeled KTP versus ATP. We found that the KTPγS signal persisted even when ATP was present at 4-fold greater concentration than KTPγS (2 mM versus 0.5 mM) (Figure S2H), suggesting that PINK1 can be activated by KTP in the presence of cellular ATP. Our results showing in vitro increases in PINK1 activity using KTP led us to investigate the ability to achieve enhanced activity of PINK1 in cells. One major challenge to activating PINK1 in cells is that ATP analogs, like KTP, are not membrane permeable; however, previous work has shown that certain cytokinins can be taken up by human cells and converted to the nucleotide triphosphate form (Ishii et al., 2003Ishii Y. Sakai S. Honma Y. Cytokinin-induced differentiation of human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells is associated with the formation of nucleotides, but not with incorporation into DNA or RNA.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1643: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent work in cells expressing hypomorphic mutant CDK2 alleles showed that the activity of CDK2 could be increased in cells by providing nucleotide analog precursors that can be converted to the nucleotide triphosphate form and are able to fit into the hypomorphic CDK2 active site (Merrick et al., 2011Merrick K.A. Wohlbold L. Zhang C. Allen J.J. Horiuchi D. Huskey N.E. Goga A. Shokat K.M. Fisher R.P. Switching Cdk2 on or off with small molecules to reveal requirements in human cell proliferation.Mol. Cell. 2011; 42: 624-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The first step in bioconversion is ribosylation of the cytokinin to a 5′-monophosphate form, which can be mediated by adenine phospho-ribosyl transferase (APRT) (Kornberg et al., 1955Kornberg A.

https://openalex.org/W2138741496,"Proteins, particularly viral proteins, can be multifunctional, but the mechanisms behind multifunctionality are not fully understood. Here, we illustrate through multiple crystal structures, biochemistry, and cellular microscopy that VP40 rearranges into different structures, each with a distinct function required for the ebolavirus life cycle. A butterfly-shaped VP40 dimer traffics to the cellular membrane. Once there, electrostatic interactions trigger rearrangement of the polypeptide into a linear hexamer. These hexamers construct a multilayered, filamentous matrix structure that is critical for budding and resembles tomograms of authentic virions. A third structure of VP40, formed by a different rearrangement, is not involved in virus assembly but instead uniquely binds RNA to regulate viral transcription inside infected cells. These results provide a functional model for ebolavirus matrix assembly and the other roles of VP40 in the virus life cycle and demonstrate how a single wild-type, unmodified polypeptide can assemble into different structures for different functions."

We choose between objects based on their values, which we learn from past experience with rewarding consequences (Awh et al., 2012Awh E. Belopolsky A.V. Theeuwes J.

On the other hand, the values of some other objects remain unchanged, and we have to choose the valuable objects based on the long-term memory.

Both flexible and stable value-guided behaviors are critical to choose the valuable objects efficiently. If we rely only on flexible values, we would always have to make an effort to find valuable objects by trial and error. If we rely only on stable values, we would fail to choose valuable objects if their values have changed recently. Therefore, our brain must acquire both flexible and stable values of objects to guide each behavior. However, the flexible and stable values are often mutually conflicting (stability-flexibility dilemma) (Abraham and Robins, 2005Abraham W.C. Robins A. Memory retention—the synaptic stability versus plasticity dilemma.Trends Neurosci. 2005; 28: 73-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, Anderson, 2007Anderson P.

Neural stability and flexibility: a computational approach.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2003; 28: S64-S73Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the flexible value, any short-term change in object value matters, and the memory must be updated quickly. For the stable value, only a long-term change matters, and the memory must be updated only slowly so that small changes can be ignored. It is still unclear how the brain encodes both flexible and stable values to guide choice behavior accordingly. It would be difficult for a single neural circuit to process the potentially conflicting values. One alternative hypothesis would be that the brain has two independent mechanisms, one encoding flexible memories and the other encoding stable memories to guide choice behavior differently in each situation. Notably, the parallel process has been suggested to be a fundamental feature of the brain anatomically and functionally (Alexander et al., 1986Alexander G.E. DeLong M.R. Strick P.L.

Especially, the basal ganglia have well-known parallel anatomical circuits connected from cortical regions to output structures (Alexander et al., 1986Alexander G.E. DeLong M.R. Strick P.L.

In particular, the caudate nucleus receives inputs from a large portion of the cerebral cortex including the prefrontal and temporal cortex (Saint-Cyr et al., 1990Saint-Cyr J.A. Ungerleider L.G.

Cai X. Hwang J. Lee D. Prefrontal and striatal activity related to values of objects and locations.Front Neurosci. 2012; 6: 108PubMed Google Scholar, Yamamoto et al., 2012Yamamoto S. Monosov I.E. Yasuda M. Hikosaka O. What and where information in the caudate tail guides saccades to visual objects.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 11005-11016Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that the caudate nucleus contains parallel functional units that process object value information independently. To test this hypothesis, we performed two experiments, first aiming at neuronal information processing and then behavioral causality. These experiments together suggested that the head and tail of the primate caudate nucleus have distinct functions, the head guiding controlled behavior based on flexible values and the tail guiding automatic behavior based on stable values. To examine the value representation and the behavior control by the caudate nucleus, we used flexible and stable value procedures (Figure 1). Figure S1, available online, shows the underlying concept. In each case, the monkey experienced fractal objects with high values and low values. In the flexible value procedure (Figure S1A), objects changed their values frequently and the monkey had to adapt to the changes flexibly. This is a short-term learning process. In the stable value procedure (Figure S1B), objects retained their values (i.e., high or low) stably across repeated learning. This is a long-term learning process. The testing of the long-term memory was done in a separate experimental context in which objects were no longer associated with the previously assigned values. We used saccades to the fractal objects as the behavioral measure (Figure 1). In the flexible value procedure (Figure 1A), the saccade to one object was followed by a reward and the other object was associated with no reward, and this contingency was reversed frequently. To examine the short-term behavioral learning, we measured the target acquisition time after a go cue (the disappearance of the fixation point). As the value of each object changed blockwise, the target acquisition time changed accordingly: the monkeys made saccades more quickly to the high-valued object than the low-valued object (Figure 1B) (difference of target acquisition time: 57.7 ms, p < 0.001, two-tailed t test). On choice trials (see Experimental Procedures), the monkeys mostly chose the high-valued object (average: 83.9% ± 0.8%). These saccades can be called “controlled saccades,” because they were controlled by reinforcing feedbacks delivered just after the saccades. During learning of stable values (Figure 1C), the saccades to a set of objects were always followed by a reward (high valued) and the saccades to a different set of objects were always followed by no reward (low valued), and this was repeated across days (see Figure S2 for detail). To examine the long-term behavioral memory, we used a free-looking task (Figure 1D) and a free-viewing procedure (Figure S2D). These tests were done at least 1 day after the learning session, and the saccades were followed by no reward. Yet, the monkey made saccades to the objects automatically and did so more likely to high-valued objects than low-valued objects. The preference to the high-valued objects emerged slowly across several daily learning sessions and then remained stable after four daily sessions of learning (Figure S2D), as reported previously (Yasuda et al., 2012Yasuda M. Yamamoto S. Hikosaka O. Robust representation of stable object values in the oculomotor Basal Ganglia.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 16917-16932Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, to analyze the neuronal and behavioral coding of stable object values, we used fractal objects that the monkey had learned for more than four daily sessions. When such well-learned objects were used in the free-looking task, the likelihood of saccades to high-valued objects was significantly higher than to low-valued ones (Figure 1D, right) (difference of automatic looking: 18.9%, p < 0.01, two-tailed t test). These saccades can be called “automatic saccades,” because they were not followed by any reinforcing feedbacks delivered just after the saccades. To test whether the caudate nucleus controls the saccade behavior to choose high-valued objects, we recorded spike activity of single neurons in the caudate nucleus using the flexible and stable value procedures. We first found that many neurons in the caudate nucleus responded to visual objects, confirming previous studies (Brown et al., 1995Brown V.J. Desimone R. Mishkin M. Responses of cells in the tail of the caudate nucleus during visual discrimination learning.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 1083-1094PubMed Google Scholar, Caan et al., 1984Caan W. Perrett D.I. Rolls E.T.

The ratios of neurons that responded to fractal objects relative to the encountered neurons in the three caudate regions (Figure 3A) were: head 163/845 (19.3%), body 109/381 (28.6%), and tail 107/205 (52.2%). Their responses were often modulated by the values associated with the objects. Importantly, neurons in different regions of the caudate nucleus were influenced by flexible and stable values differently. Figure 2 shows the activity of three example neurons that were recorded from three caudate regions. In the flexible value procedure (Figures 1A and 2A), the three example neurons in the caudate responded to the fractal objects with a phasic activation but in different ways (Figure 2C). The caudate head neuron was activated by the objects when their values were high (Figure 2C, left, red), but not when their values were low (Figure 2C, left, blue) (p < 0.001, two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The caudate body neuron weakly encoded the flexible reward values of the objects (Figure 2C, center): its responses to the objects were more prolonged when their values were low. In contrast, the responses of the caudate tail neuron were not influenced by the flexibly changing values of the objects (Figure 2C, right). In the stable value procedure, the same three caudate neurons behaved quite differently compared to the activity in the flexible value procedure. To test the neuronal activity, we serially presented fractals without any object-reward contingency while the monkey was fixing on the center dot (Figure 2B). The caudate head neuron, which responded selectively to objects with high flexible values (Figure 2C, left), became nearly silent in the stable value procedure (Figure 2D, left). The caudate body neuron, which weakly encoded negative flexible values (Figure 2C, center), showed little bias based on stable values (Figure 2D, center). In contrast, the caudate tail neuron, which was not influenced by objects’ flexible values (Figure 2C, right), now showed a clear bias toward objects with high stable values (Figure 2D, right) (p < 0.001, two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The regional difference in flexible/stable value encoding, exemplified in Figure 2, was commonly present among caudate neurons. This is shown in Figures 3B and 3C as the averaged responses of all neurons responding to fractal objects in the three caudate subregions. Since different caudate neurons responded more strongly to high-valued objects or to low-valued objects (positive and negative neurons in Figures 3D and 3E), we averaged the neurons’ responses (using cross-validation) separately for the neurons’ preferred value (magenta) and the nonpreferred value (black) (Figures 3B and 3C). The bias in activity based on flexible values appears strongest in the caudate head and weakest in the caudate tail (Figure 3B, yellow). In contrast, the bias in activity based on stable values appears strongest in the caudate tail and weakest in the caudate head (Figure 3C, yellow). Similar trends were observed for both positive and negative neurons (Figure S3). These conclusions were confirmed by the subregional difference in the proportion of neurons that showed a statistically significant bias based on flexible values (Figure 3D) or stable values (Figure 3E). The flexible and stable value biases showed two opposing gradients across the caudate head, body, and tail. An analysis of individual neurons supports these conclusions (Figure 4).Figure 4Flexible and Stable Values by Individual Neurons in the Caudate SubregionsShow full caption(A–C) Comparison between flexible value coding (abscissa) and stable value coding (ordinate) in the caudate head (n = 125) (A), body (n = 65) (B), and tail (n = 87) (C).

First, the regional difference might be caused by the monkey’s long-term experience of the experimental procedure. This is unlikely, however, because we recorded from the three caudate subregions in a temporally counterbalanced manner along the whole experimental project. Second, the regional difference might depend on the difference in the testing procedure (i.e., saccades to objects in the flexible value procedure, not in the stable value procedure). However, this possibility was not supported by a supplemental experiment using the flexible value-fixation task (Figure S4). We so far have shown that (1) the flexible and stable values are represented in the caudate subregions differentially (particularly caudate head and tail) and (2) the flexible and stable values induce controlled and automatic saccades, respectively. These results suggest that the caudate nucleus contains parallel mechanisms: the caudate head guides controlled saccades based on flexible values and the caudate tail guides automatic saccades based on stable values. Our data support this hypothesis, as shown below. Since caudate body neurons showed an intermediate coding pattern, we will focus on the comparison between the caudate head and tail. First, neurons in the caudate head, not tail, showed value-differential activity before controlled saccades. In the flexible value procedure that induced controlled saccades (Figures 1A and 1B), the value-differential response of caudate head neurons (Figure 5A, left, yellow) emerged in parallel with the change in the monkey’s target acquisition time (Figure 5B, left, yellow). Such a correlation was absent in caudate tail neurons (Figure 5, right). Second, the flexible-stable dichotomy was observed using the object-value association learning task (Figure S2) in different contexts (Figure 6). When the monkey learned the values of novel objects (Figure 6A, left), neurons in the caudate head, not tail, acquired the value-differential response (Figures 6B and 6C, left), as in the flexible value procedure (Figure 5A). In contrast, when well-learned objects were introduced after more than 1 day retention, the monkey showed a clear bias in the target acquisition time from the beginning throughout the session (Figure 6A, right). This was paralleled by the stably maintained value bias in caudate tail neurons (Figure 6C, right), which was absent during the new learning (Figure 6C, left). Notably, caudate head neurons showed no value bias initially, although they quickly acquired it (Figure 6B, right). These results suggest that neurons in the caudate tail, not head, can support the value-differential saccades when previously well-learned objects are unexpectedly presented. Third, in the flexible value procedure, the overall presaccadic activity of caudate head neurons was significantly stronger to preferred value objects than nonpreferred value objects (Figure 7A, top), but such a bias was not detected in the caudate tail (Figure 7A, bottom). In the free-looking task (as part of the stable value procedure) that induced automatic saccades (Figure 1D), caudate tail neurons showed presaccadic activity that was significantly stronger to preferred value objects than to nonpreferred value objects (Figure 7B, bottom). Such presaccadic activity was absent in caudate head neurons (Figure 7B, top). The caudate tail-specific activity preceding automatic saccades was confirmed using a free-viewing procedure (Figure S5) in which four objects, chosen randomly on each trial, were presented simultaneously and the monkey looked at them with no reward consequence. To further test the flexible-stable dichotomy hypothesis, we selectively inactivated the caudate head or the caudate tail by injecting a GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol (Figure 8A). The inactivation of the caudate head disrupted the initiation of saccades in the flexible value task (which we call controlled saccades) (Figure 8B, top). Before the inactivation, the target acquisition time on single object trials was significantly shorter for high-valued objects than for low-valued objects (Figure 1B, Figure S6B, left). This bias of controlled saccades decreased significantly during the caudate head inactivation (Figure 8B, top) but only for contralateral saccades (from 69.7 ms to 20.4 ms; p < 0.01, paired t test). The bias decrease was largely due to earlier saccades to low-valued objects (Figure S6B, top). The caudate head inactivation also disrupted the choice of the high-valued objects in the flexible value task (Figure S7C, top), again only for contralateral saccades (p < 0.05, paired t test), when four, not two, objects were used. However, the caudate head inactivation did not affect saccades in the stable value procedure using either the free-looking task (Figure 8C, top) or the free-viewing procedure (Figure S8B). In contrast, the inactivation of the caudate tail specifically disrupted the initiation of saccades in the stable value task (free-looking task) (Figure 8C, bottom). Before the inactivation, the likelihood of saccades to the presented object (which we call automatic saccades) was higher for high-valued objects than for low-valued objects (Figure 1D, Figure S6D, left). This bias of automatic saccades disappeared during the caudate tail inactivation (Figure 8C, bottom) but only for contralateral saccades (from 19.9% to −1.2%; p < 0.01, paired t test). The bias decrease was largely due to more frequent saccades to low-valued objects (Figure S6D, bottom). Among the saccades made to the presented object, there was no change in latency. The caudate tail inactivation also disrupted the choice of the high-valued objects in the stable value task, again only for contralateral saccades (free-viewing procedure, Figure S8C; see Figure S5 for neuronal activity). However, the caudate tail inactivation did not affect saccades in the flexible value procedure in either the single object trials (Figure 8B, bottom) or the choice trials (Figure S7C, bottom). Our results demonstrate that two subregions of the caudate nucleus, head and tail, distinctly encode the flexible and stable values of visual objects, and these value memories guide behavior in controlled and automatic manners, selectively and respectively. This provides an answer to a long-standing question about the function of the parallel neural circuits in the basal ganglia. The parallel circuits are thought to serve different functions, such as oculomotor, motor, cognitive, and emotional functions (Alexander et al., 1986Alexander G.E. DeLong M.R. Strick P.L. Parallel organization of functionally segregated circuits linking basal ganglia and cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1986; 9: 357-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how these circuits coordinate with each other during adaptive behavior. Our data suggest that the caudate subregions work integratively but independently, aiming at a unitary goal, choosing valuable objects. How can parallel and independent mechanisms work for a unitary goal? We propose that caudate head and tail work in a mutually complementary manner. Their complementary features are 2-fold: information and behavior, as discussed below. Flexible value coding is useful to find valuable objects if their values change frequently. This is the function that the caudate head contributes to. Single neurons of the caudate head change their responses flexibly to inform which objects are recently more (or less) valuable. Their responses rely on short-term memory or working memory. Such flexibility is an essential feature of cognitive functions (Kehagia et al., 2010Kehagia A.A. Murray G.K. Robbins T.W. Learning and cognitive flexibility: frontostriatal function and monoaminergic modulation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Indeed, many neurons in “cognitive” brain areas encode flexible object values (Kim et al., 2008Kim S. Hwang J. Lee D.

Relative reward preference in primate orbitofrontal cortex.Nature. 1999; 398: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). However, the caudate head does not retain the value information, once the reinforcing feedback is not delivered immediately. This is problematic because the information would not allow us (and animals) to choose valuable objects until we experience an actual reward. The caudate tail, as part of the stable value system, would compensate for this limitation. Single neurons in the caudate tail respond to objects differentially based on the previous, long-term experience of the objects (see Yamamoto et al., 2013Yamamoto S. Kim H.F. Hikosaka O. Reward value-contingent changes of visual responses in the primate caudate tail associated with a visuomotor skill.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 11227-11238Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar for details). This information would enable us to choose valuable objects without updated feedback. Such stable value information would underlie visual skills (Gottlieb, 2012Gottlieb J.

Ski2, Ski3, and Ski8 assemble in a tetramer with 1:1:2 stoichiometry. The crystal structure of an S. cerevisiae 370 kDa core complex shows that Ski3 forms an array of 33 TPR motifs organized in N-terminal and C-terminal arms. The C-terminal arm of Ski3 and the two Ski8 subunits position the helicase core of Ski2 centrally within the complex, enhancing RNA binding. The Ski3 N-terminal arm and the Ski2 insertion domain allosterically modulate the ATPase and helicase activities of the complex. Biochemical data suggest that the Ski complex can thread RNAs directly to the exosome, coupling the helicase and the exoribonuclease through a continuous RNA channel. Finally, we identify a Ski8-binding motif common to Ski3 and Spo11, rationalizing the moonlighting properties of Ski8 in mRNA decay and meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1986907203,"During breast cancer progression, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) switches from acting as a growth inhibitor to become a major promoter of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanisms involved in this switch are not clear. We found that loss of CCAAT-enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ), a differentiation factor for the mammary epithelium, was associated with signs of EMT in triple-negative human breast cancer, and in invasive areas of mammary tumors in MMTV-PyMT mice. Using an established model of TGF-β-induced EMT in mouse mammary gland epithelial cells, we discovered that C/EBPβ was repressed during EMT by miR-155, an oncomiR in breast cancer. Depletion of C/EBPβ potentiated the TGF-β response towards EMT, and contributed to evasion of the growth inhibitory response to TGF-β. Furthermore, loss of C/EBPβ enhanced invasion and metastatic dissemination of the mouse mammary tumor cells to the lungs after subcutaneous injection into mice. The mechanism by which loss of C/EBPβ promoted the TGF-β response towards EMT, invasion and metastasis, was traced to a previously uncharacterized role of C/EBPβ as a transcriptional activator of genes encoding the epithelial junction proteins E-cadherin and coxsackie virus and adenovirus receptor. The results identify miR-155-mediated loss of C/EBPβ as a mechanism, which promotes breast cancer progression by shifting the TGF-β response from growth inhibition to EMT, invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2020179005,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are highly sensitive to DNA damage and have low survival ability relative to differentiated cells. We investigated the source of this difference by comparing damage response pathways in hESCs and differentiated cells. We found that hESCs undergo more rapid p53-dependent apoptosis after DNA damage than differentiated cells do. However, p53 localization and function are similar between hESCs and differentiated cells, suggesting that p53 alone cannot explain the difference in sensitivity. Instead, we show that mitochondrial readiness for apoptosis, known as mitochondrial priming, differs between hESCs and differentiated cells. Specifically, the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins is shifted closer to the apoptotic threshold in hESCs than in differentiated cells. Altering this balance in differentiated cells increases their sensitivity and results in cell death, suggesting that manipulation of mitochondrial priming could potentially alter the sensitivity of other stem cells, including cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2127013861,"The molecular mechanism of autophagy and its relationship to other lysosomal degradation pathways remain incompletely understood. Here, we identified a previously uncharacterized mammalian-specific protein, Beclin 2, which, like Beclin 1, functions in autophagy and interacts with class III PI3K complex components and Bcl-2. However, Beclin 2, but not Beclin 1, functions in an additional lysosomal degradation pathway. Beclin 2 is required for ligand-induced endolysosomal degradation of several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) through its interaction with GASP1. Beclin 2 homozygous knockout mice have decreased embryonic viability, and heterozygous knockout mice have defective autophagy, increased levels of brain cannabinoid 1 receptor, elevated food intake, and obesity and insulin resistance. Our findings identify Beclin 2 as a converging regulator of autophagy and GPCR turnover and highlight the functional and mechanistic diversity of Beclin family members in autophagy, endolysosomal trafficking, and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2118600164,"It has been postulated that selective temporal coordination between neurons and development of functional neuronal assemblies are fundamental for brain function and behavior. Still, there is little evidence that functionally relevant coordination emerges preferentially in neuronal assemblies directly controlling behavioral output. We investigated coherence between primary motor cortex and the dorsal striatum as rats learn an abstract operant task. Striking coherence developed between these regions during learning. Interestingly, coherence was selectively increased in cells controlling behavioral output relative to adjacent cells. Furthermore, the temporal offset of these interactions aligned closely with corticostriatal conduction delays, demonstrating highly precise timing. Spikes from either region were followed by a consistent phase in the other, suggesting that network feedback reinforces coherence. Together, these results demonstrate that temporally precise coherence develops during learning specifically in output-relevant neuronal populations and further suggest that correlations in oscillatory activity serve to synchronize widespread brain networks to produce behavior."

Using GFP-binding proteins derived from Camelid antibodies, we co-opted GFP as a scaffold for inducing formation of biologically active complexes, developing a library of hybrid transcription factors that control gene expression only in the presence of GFP or its derivatives. The modular design allows for variation in key properties such as DNA specificity, transcriptional potency, and drug dependency. Production of GFP controlled cell-specific gene expression and facilitated functional perturbations in the mouse retina and brain. Further, retrofitting existing transgenic GFP mouse and zebrafish lines for GFP-dependent transcription enabled applications such as optogenetic probing of neural circuits. This work establishes GFP as a multifunctional scaffold and opens the door to selective manipulation of diverse GFP-labeled cells across transgenic lines. This approach may also be extended to exploit other intracellular products as cell-specific scaffolds in multicellular organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2068004082,"Idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (ICP) has traditionally been defined as chronic pancreatitis in the absence of any obvious precipitating factors (e.g. alcohol abuse) and family history of the disease. Studies over the past 15 years have revealed that ICP has a highly complex genetic architecture involving multiple gene loci. Here, we have attempted to provide a conservative assessment of the major genetic causes of ICP in a sample of 253 young French ICP patients. For the first time, conventional types of mutation (comprising coding sequence variants and variants at intron/exon boundaries) and gross genomic rearrangements were screened for in all four major pancreatitis genes, PRSS1, SPINK1, CTRC and CFTR. For the purposes of the study, synonymous, intronic and 5'- or 3'-untranslated region variants were excluded from the analysis except where there was persuasive evidence of functional consequences. The remaining sequence variants/genotypes were classified into causative, contributory or neutral categories by consideration of (i) their allele frequencies in patient and normal control populations, (ii) their presumed or experimentally confirmed functional effects, (iii) the relative importance of their associated genes in the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis and (iv) gene-gene interactions wherever applicable. Adoption of this strategy allowed us to assess the pathogenic relevance of specific variants/genotypes to their respective carriers to an unprecedented degree. The genetic cause of ICP could be assigned in 23.7% of individuals in the study group. A strong genetic susceptibility factor was also present in an additional 24.5% of cases. Taken together, up to 48.2% of the studied ICP patients were found to display evidence of a genetic basis for their pancreatitis. Whereas these particular proportions may not be extrapolable to all ICP patients, the approach employed should serve as a useful framework for acquiring a better understanding of the role of genetic factors in causing this oligogenic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2052238161,"Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate (MARCKS), a substrate of protein kinase C, is a key regulatory molecule controlling mucus granule secretion by airway epithelial cells as well as directed migration of leukocytes, stem cells and fibroblasts. Phosphorylation of MARKCS may be involved in these responses. However, the functionality of MARCKS and its related phosphorylation in lung cancer malignancy have not been characterized. This study demonstrated elevated levels of MARCKS and phospho-MARCKS in highly invasive lung cancer cell lines and lung cancer specimens from non-small-cell lung cancer patients. siRNA knockdown of MARCKS expression in these highly invasive lung cancer cell lines reduced cell migration and suppressed PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase)/Akt phosphorylation and Slug level. Interestingly, treatment with a peptide identical to the MARCKS N-terminus sequence (the MANS peptide) impaired cell migration in vitro and also the metastatic potential of invasive lung cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistically, MANS peptide treatment resulted in a coordination of increase of E-cadherin expression, suppression of MARCKS phosphorylation and AKT/Slug signalling pathway but not the expression of total MARCKS. These results indicate a crucial role for MARCKS, specifically its phosphorylated form, in potentiating lung cancer cell migration/metastasis and suggest a potential use of MARCKS-related peptides in the treatment of lung cancer metastasis."

CMD can be inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD) trait or occur after de novo mutations in the pyrophosphate transporter ANKH. Although the autosomal recessive (AR) form of CMD had been mapped to 6q21-22 the mutation has been elusive. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing for one subject with AR CMD and identified a novel missense mutation (c.716G>A, p.Arg239Gln) in the C-terminus of the gap junction protein alpha-1 (GJA1) coding for connexin 43 (Cx43). We confirmed this mutation in 6 individuals from 3 additional families. The homozygous mutation cosegregated only with affected family members. Connexin 43 is a major component of gap junctions in osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts and chondrocytes. Gap junctions are responsible for the diffusion of low molecular weight molecules between cells. Mutations in Cx43 cause several dominant and recessive disorders involving developmental abnormalities of bone such as dominant and recessive oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD; MIM #164200, 257850) and isolated syndactyly type III (MIM #186100), the characteristic digital anomaly in ODDD. However, characteristic ocular and dental features of ODDD as well as syndactyly are absent in patients with the recessive Arg239Gln Cx43 mutation.

https://openalex.org/W2022597841,"A number of small-molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases have been developed and are undergoing clinical trials for anti-cancer therapies. Different Aurora kinases, however, behave as very different targets: while inhibition of Aurora A (AURKA) induces a delay in mitotic exit, inhibition of Aurora B (AURKB) triggers mitotic slippage. Furthermore, while it is evident that p53 is regulated by Aurora kinase-dependent phosphorylation, how p53 may in turn regulate Aurora kinases remains mysterious. To address these issues, isogenic p53-containing and -negative cells were exposed to classic inhibitors that target both AURKA and AURKB (Alisertib and ZM447439), as well as to new generation of inhibitors that target AURKA (MK-5108), AURKB (Barasertib) individually. The fate of individual cells was then tracked with time-lapse microscopy. Remarkably, loss of p53, either by gene disruption or small interfering RNA-mediated depletion, sensitized cells to inhibition of both AURKA and AURKB, promoting mitotic arrest and slippage respectively. As the p53-dependent post-mitotic checkpoint is also important for preventing genome reduplication after mitotic slippage, these studies indicate that the loss of p53 in cancer cells represents a major opportunity for anti-cancer drugs targeting the Aurora kinases."

Besides, nanotube-based interfaces are being developed, such as prosthesis for monitoring brain activity. We recently described how carbon nanotube substrates alter the electrophysiological and synaptic responses of hippocampal neurons in culture. This observation highlighted the exceptional ability of this material in interfering with nerve tissue growth. Here we test the hypothesis that carbon nanotube scaffolds promote the development of immature neurons isolated from the neonatal rat spinal cord, and maintained in vitro. To address this issue we performed electrophysiological studies associated to gene expression analysis. Our results indicate that spinal neurons plated on electro-conductive carbon nanotubes show a facilitated development. Spinal neurons anticipate the expression of functional markers of maturation, such as the generation of voltage dependent currents or action potentials. These changes are accompanied by a selective modulation of gene expression, involving neuronal and non-neuronal components. Our microarray experiments suggest that carbon nanotube platforms trigger reparative activities involving microglia, in the absence of reactive gliosis. Hence, future tissue scaffolds blended with conductive nanotubes may be exploited to promote cell differentiation and reparative pathways in neural regeneration strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2000214703,"Groupers of the family Epinephelidae are a diverse and economically valuable group of reef fishes. To investigate the evolution of their mitochondrial genomes we characterized and compared these genomes among 22 species, 17 newly sequenced. Among these fishes we identified three distinct genome organizations, two of them never previously reported in vertebrates. In 19 of these species, mitochondrial genomes followed the typical vertebrate canonical organization with 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs, two rRNAs, and a non-coding control region. Differing from this, members of genus Variola have an extra tRNA-Ile between tRNA-Val and 16S rRNA. Evidence suggests that this evolved from tRNA-Val via a duplication event due to slipped strand mispairing during replication. Additionally, Cephalopholis argus has an extra tRNA-Asp in the midst of the control region, likely resulting from long-range duplication of the canonical tRNA-Asp through illicit priming of mitochondrial replication by tRNAs. Along with their gene contents, we characterized the regulatory elements of these mitochondrial genomes’ control regions, including putative termination-associated sequences and conserved sequence blocks. Looking at the mitochondrial genomic constituents, rRNA and tRNA are the most conserved, followed by protein-coding genes, and non-coding regions are the most divergent. Divergence rates vary among the protein-coding genes, and the three cytochrome oxidase subunits (COI, II, III) are the most conserved, while NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND6) and the ATP synthase subunit 8 (ATP8) are the most divergent. We then tested the phylogenetic utility of this new mt genome data using 12 protein-coding genes of 48 species from the suborder Percoidei. From this, we provide further support for the elevation of the subfamily Epinephelinae to family Epinephelidae, the resurrection of the genus Hyporthodus, and the combination of the monotypic genera Anyperodon and Cromileptes to genus Epinephelus, and Aethaloperca to genus Cephalopholis."

In the resistant ecotype Col-0, xopAC is a major avirulence gene of Xcc. In this study, we show that both the RLCK interaction domain and the uridylyl transferase domain of XopAC are required for avirulence. Furthermore, xopAC can also confer avirulence to both the vascular pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and the mesophyll-colonizing pathogen Pseudomonas syringae indicating that xopAC-specified effector-triggered immunity is not specific to the vascular system. In planta, XopAC-YFP fusions are localized at the plasma membrane suggesting that XopAC might interact with membrane-localized proteins. Eight RLCK of subfamily VII predicted to be localized at the plasma membrane and interacting with XopAC in yeast two-hybrid assays have been isolated.

https://openalex.org/W2154936893,"Allosteric interactions provide precise spatiotemporal control over signaling proteins, but how allosteric activators and their targets coevolve is poorly understood. Here, we trace the evolution of two allosteric activator motifs within the yeast scaffold protein Ste5 that specifically target the mating MAP kinase Fus3. One activator (Ste5-VWA) provides pathway insulation and dates to the divergence of Fus3 from its paralog, Kss1; a second activator (Ste5-FBD) that tunes mating behavior is, in contrast, not conserved in most lineages. Surprisingly, both Ste5 activator motifs could regulate MAP kinases that diverged from Fus3 prior to the emergence of Ste5, suggesting that Ste5 activators arose by exploiting latent regulatory features already present in the MAPK ancestor. The magnitude of this latent allosteric potential drifts widely among pre-Ste5 MAP kinases, providing a pool of hidden phenotypic diversity that, when revealed by new activators, could lead to functional divergence and to the evolution of distinct signaling behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2081025609,"Polysialic acid (polySia), an α-2,8-glycosidically linked polymer of sialic acid, is a developmentally regulated post-translational modification predominantly found on NCAM (neuronal cell adhesion molecule). Whilst high levels are expressed during development, peripheral adult organs do not express polySia-NCAM. However, tumours of neural crest-origin re-express polySia-NCAM: its occurrence correlates with aggressive and invasive disease and poor clinical prognosis in different cancer types, notably including small cell lung cancer (SCLC), pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma. In neuronal development, polySia-NCAM biosynthesis is catalysed by two polysialyltransferases, ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV, but it is ST8SiaII that is the prominent enzyme in tumours. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ST8SiaII inhibition by a small molecule on tumour cell migration, utilising cytidine monophosphate (CMP) as a tool compound. Using immunoblotting we showed that CMP reduced ST8iaII-mediated polysialylation of NCAM. Utilizing a novel HPLC-based assay to quantify polysialylation of a fluorescent acceptor (DMB-DP3), we demonstrated that CMP is a competitive inhibitor of ST8SiaII (K i = 10 µM). Importantly, we have shown that CMP causes a concentration-dependent reduction in tumour cell-surface polySia expression, with an absence of toxicity. When ST8SiaII-expressing tumour cells (SH-SY5Y and C6-STX) were evaluated in 2D cell migration assays, ST8SiaII inhibition led to significant reductions in migration, while CMP had no effect on cells not expressing ST8SiaII (DLD-1 and C6-WT). The study demonstrates for the first time that a polysialyltransferase inhibitor can modulate migration in ST8SiaII-expressing tumour cells. We conclude that ST8SiaII can be considered a druggable target with the potential for interfering with a critical mechanism in tumour cell dissemination in metastatic cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2138657838,"The larvae of the wax moth, Galleria mellonella, have been used experimentally to host a range of bacterial and fungal pathogens. In this study we evaluated the suitability of G. mellonella as an alternative animal model of Salmonella infection. Using a range of inoculum doses we established that the LD₅₀ of SalmonellaTyphimurium strain NCTC 12023 was 3.6 × 10³ bacteria per larva. Further, a set of isogenic mutant strains depleted of known virulence factors was tested to identify determinants essential for S. Typhimurium pathogenesis. Mutants depleted of one or both of the type III secretion systems encoded by Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands 1 and 2 showed no virulence defect. In contrast, we observed reduced pathogenic potential of a phoQ mutant indicating an important role for the PhoPQ two-component signal transduction system. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure was also shown to influence Salmonella virulence in G. mellonella. A waaL(rfaL) mutant, which lacks the entire O-antigen (OAg), was virtually avirulent, while a wzz(ST)/wzz(fepE) double mutant expressing only a very short OAg was highly attenuated for virulence. Furthermore, shortly after infection both LPS mutant strains showed decreased replication when compared to the wild type in a flow cytometry-based competitive index assay. In this study we successfully established a G. mellonella model of S. Typhimurium infection. By identifying PhoQ and LPS OAg length as key determinants of virulence in the wax moth larvae we proved that there is an overlap between this and other animal model systems, thus confirming that the G. mellonella infection model is suitable for assessing aspects of Salmonella virulence function."
https://openalex.org/W2009624913,"One of the main hallmarks of the fronto-temporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) is the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in the brain as an outcome of the aggregation of mutated tau protein. This process occurs due to a number of genetic mutations in the MAPT gene. One of these mutations is the ∆K280 mutation in the tau R2 repeat domain, which promotes the aggregation vis-à-vis that for the wild-type tau. Experimental studies have shown that in Alzheimer's disease Aβ peptide forms aggregates both with itself and with wild-type tau. By analogy, in FTDP-17, it is likely that there are interactions between Aβ and mutated tau, but the molecular mechanisms underlying such interactions remain to be elucidated. Thus, to investigate the interactions between Aβ and mutated tau, we constructed fourteen ∆K280 mutated tau-Aβ17-42 oligomeric complexes. In seven of the mutated tau-Aβ17-42 oligoemric complexes the mutated tau oligomers exhibited hydrophobic interactions in their core domain, and in the other seven mutated tau-Aβ17-42 oligoemric complexes the mutated tau oligomers exhibited salt-bridge interactions in their core domain. We considered two types of interactions between mutated tau oligomers and Aβ oligomers: interactions of one monomer of the Aβ oligomer with one monomer of the mutated tau oligomer to form a single-layer conformation, and interactions of the entire Aβ oligomer with the entire mutated tau oligomer to form a double-layer conformation. We also considered parallel arrangements of Aβ trimers alternating with mutated tau trimers in a single-layer conformation. Our results demonstrate that in the interactions of Aβ and mutated tau oligomers, polymorphic mutated tau-Aβ17-42 oligomeric complexes were observed, with a slight preference for the double-layer conformation. Aβ trimers alternating with mutated tau trimers constituted a structurally stable confined β-structure, albeit one that was energetically less stable than all the other constructed models."
https://openalex.org/W1972407541,"Lysosomal cysteine cathepsins contribute to proteolytic events promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Their enzymatic activity, however, is tightly regulated by endogenous inhibitors. To investigate the role of cathepsin inhibitor stefin B (Stfb) in mammary cancer, Stfb null mice were crossed with transgenic polyoma virus middle T oncogene (PyMT) breast cancer mice. We show that ablation of Stfb resulted in reduced size of mammary tumors but did not affect their rate of metastasis. Importantly, decrease in tumor growth was correlated with an increased incidence of dead cell islands detected in tumors of Stfb-deficient mice. Ex vivo analysis of primary PyMT tumor cells revealed no significant effects of ablation of Stfb expression on proliferation, angiogenesis, migration and spontaneous cell death as compared with control cells. However, upon treatment with the lysosomotropic agent Leu-Leu-OMe, cancer cells lacking Stfb exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity to apoptosis. Moreover, Stfb-ablated tumor cells were significantly more prone to cell death under increased oxidative stress. These results indicate an in vivo role for Stfb in protecting cancer cells by promoting their resistance to oxidative stress and to apoptosis induced through the lysosomal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2047041895,"Background Mortality among TB/HIV co-infected patients is still high particularly in developing countries. This study aimed to determine the predictors of death in TB/HIV co-infected patients during TB treatment. Methods We reviewed medical records at the time of TB diagnosis and subsequent follow-up of all newly registered TB patients with HIV co-infection at TB clinics in the Institute of Respiratory Medicine and three public hospitals in the Klang Valley between January 2010 and September 2010. We reviewed these medical records again twelve months after their initial diagnosis to determine treatment outcomes and survival. We analysed using Kaplan-Meier and conducted multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis to identify predictors of death during TB treatment in TB/HIV co-infected patients. Results Of the 227 patients studied, 53 (23.3%) had died at the end of the study with 40% of deaths within two months of TB diagnosis. Survival at 2, 6 and 12 months after initiating TB treatment were 90.7%, 82.8% and 78.8% respectively. After adjusting for other factors, death in TB/HIV co-infected patients was associated with being Malay (aHR 4.48; 95%CI 1.73-11.64), CD4 T-lymphocytes count < 200 cells/µl (aHR 3.89; 95% CI 1.20-12.63), three or more opportunistic infections (aHR 3.61; 95% CI 1.04-12.55), not receiving antiretroviral therapy (aHR 3.21; 95% CI 1.76-5.85) and increase per 103 total white blood cell count per microliter (aHR 1.12; 95% CI 1.05-1.20) Conclusion TB/HIV co-infected patients had a high case fatality rate during TB treatment. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy in these patients can improve survival by restoring immune function and preventing opportunistic infections."
https://openalex.org/W2036038440,"Physiological electric field (EF) plays a pivotal role in tissue development and regeneration. In vitro, cells under direct-current electric field (dcEF) stimulation may demonstrate directional migration (electrotaxis) and long axis reorientation (electro-alignment). Although the biophysical models and biochemical signaling pathways behind cell electrotaxis have been investigated in numerous normal cells and cancer cells, the molecular signaling mechanisms in CL1 lung adenocarcinoma cells have not been identified. Two subclones of CL1 cells, the low invasive CL1-0 cells and the highly invasive CL 1-5 cells, were investigated in the present study. CL1-0 cells are non-electrotactic while the CL 1-5 cells are anodally electrotactic and have high expression level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), in this study, we investigated the generally accepted hypothesis of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation in the two cell lines under dcEF stimulation. Erbitux, a therapeutic drug containing an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, was used to investigate the EGFR signaling in the electrotaxis of CL 1-5 cells. To investigate RTK phosphorylation and intracellular signaling in the CL1 cells, large amount of cellular proteins were collected in an airtight dcEF stimulation device, which has advantages of large culture area, uniform EF distribution, easy operation, easy cell collection, no contamination, and no medium evaporation. Commercial antibody arrays and Western blotting were used to study the phosphorylation profiles of major proteins in CL1 cells under dcEF stimulation. We found that electrotaxis of CL 1-5 cells is serum independent and EGFR independent. Moreover, the phosphorylation of Akt and S6 ribosomal protein (rpS6) in dcEF-stimulated CL1 cells are different from that in EGF-stimulated cells. This result suggests that CL1 cells' response to dcEF stimulation is not through EGFR-triggered pathways. The new large-scale dcEF stimulation device developed in the present work will aid the sample preparation for protein-based experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2110696782,"In the absence of clinically-efficacious therapies for ischemic stroke there is a critical need for development of new therapeutic concepts and approaches for prevention of brain injury secondary to cerebral ischemia. This study tests the hypothesis that administration of PNU-120596, a type-II positive allosteric modulator (PAM-II) of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), as long as 6 hours after the onset of focal cerebral ischemia significantly reduces brain injury and neurological deficits in an animal model of ischemic stroke. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by a transient (90 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Animals were then subdivided into two groups and injected intravenously (i.v.) 6 hours post-MCAO with either 1 mg/kg PNU-120596 (treated group) or vehicle only (untreated group). Measurements of cerebral infarct volumes and neurological behavioral tests were performed 24 hrs post-MCAO. PNU-120596 significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume and improved neurological function as evidenced by the results of Bederson, rolling cylinder and ladder rung walking tests. These results forecast a high therapeutic potential for PAMs-II as effective recruiters and activators of endogenous α7 nAChR-dependent cholinergic pathways to reduce brain injury and improve neurological function after cerebral ischemic stroke."

Furthermore, there are no data on the viral efficacy of raltegravir (RAL) plus ritonavir-boosted Darunavir (DRV/r) in patients with suppressed viral load. Methods This multicenter, randomized trial compared renal function and viral efficacy in patients with suppressed viral load treated with RAL+DRV/r and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) plus tenofovir/emtricitabine (TVD), who had been previously on LPV/r+TVD. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with >10% improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 48 weeks calculated with Cockcroft-Gault equation. Results 58 randomized and treatment-exposed patients were analyzed (28 on RAL+DRV/r and 30 on LPV/r+TVD). Greater than 10% improvement in eGFR was noted in 6 (25%) out of 24 with RAL+DRV/r and 3 (11%) of 28 with LPV/r+TVD, and the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.272, 95% CI -0.067 to 0.354). Sensitivity analyses using three other equations for eGFR showed the same results. Urinary β2 microglobulin, a sensitive marker of tenofovir tubulopathy, significantly improved with RAL+DRV/r than with LPV/r+TVD (-271 versus -64 µg/gCr, p=0.026). Per protocol analysis showed that the HIV-RNA was <50 copies/mL at week 48 in all patients of both arms (24 in RAL+DRV and 29 in LPV/r+TVD). Conclusions Switching LPV/r+TVD to RAL+DRV/r did not significantly increase the proportion of patients who showed >10% improvement in renal function among those with relatively preserved eGFR. However, the switch improved urinary β2 microglobulin, suggesting that discontinuation of TDF might be beneficial in the long-term. RAL+DRV/r showed favorable viral efficacy in patients with suppressed viral load.

https://openalex.org/W2098218803,"A crucial role of the inflammatory lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in breast cancer aggressiveness has been reported. Recent clinical studies have suggested that C-reactive protein (CRP) has a role in breast cancer development. However, limited information is available on the molecular basis for the expression of CRP and its functional significance in breast cell invasion. The present study aimed to elucidate the molecular link between S1P and CRP during the invasive process of breast epithelial cells. This is the first report showing that transcription of CRP was markedly activated by S1P in breast cells. Our data suggest that not only S1P treatment but also the endogenously produced S1P may upregulate CRP in breast carcinoma cells. Transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta and c-fos were required for S1P-induced CRP expression. Coupling of S1P3 to heterotrimeric Gαq triggered the expression of CRP, utilizing signaling pathways involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs). S1P-induced CRP expression was crucial for the transcriptional activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 through ERKs, ROS and c-fos, leading to breast cell invasion. Using a xenograft mice tumor model, we demonstrated that S1P induced CRP expression both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings have revealed a molecular basis for S1P-induced transcriptional activation of CRP and its functional significance in the acquisition of the invasive phenotype of human breast epithelial cells under inflammatory conditions. Our findings may provide useful information on the identification of useful therapeutic targets for inflammatory breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1980466961,"The epigenetic regulator BMI1 is upregulated progressively in a wide variety of human tumors including colorectal cancer. In this study, we assessed the requirement for Bmi1 in intestinal tumorigenesis using an autochthonous mouse model in which Apc was conditionally ablated in the intestinal epithelium. Germline mutation of Bmi1 significantly reduced both the number and size of small intestinal adenomas arising in this model, and it acted in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, in contrast to wild-type controls, Bmi1(-/-) mice showed no increase in median tumor size, and a dramatic decrease in tumor number, between 3 and 4 months of age. Thus, Bmi1 is required for both progression and maintenance of small intestinal adenomas. Importantly, Bmi1 deficiency did not disrupt oncogenic events arising from Apc inactivation. Instead, the Arf tumor suppressor, a known target of Bmi1 epigenetic silencing, was upregulated in Bmi1 mutant tumors. This was accompanied by significant upregulation of p53, which was confirmed by sequencing to be wild-type, and also elevated apoptosis within the smallest Bmi1(-/-) adenomas. By crossing Arf into this cancer model, we showed that Arf is required for the induction of both p53 and apoptosis, and it is a key determinant of the ability of Bmi1 deficiency to suppress intestinal tumorigenesis. Finally, a conditional Bmi1 mutant strain was generated and used to determine the consequences of deleting Bmi1 specifically within the intestinal epithelium. Strikingly, intestinal-specific Bmi1 deletion suppressed small intestinal adenomas in a manner that was indistinguishable from germline Bmi1 deletion. Thus, we conclude that Bmi1 deficiency impairs the progression and maintenance of small intestinal tumors in a cell autonomous and highly Arf-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2029021753,"Folate metabolism, also known as one-carbon metabolism, is required for several cellular processes including DNA synthesis, repair and methylation. Impairments of this pathway have been often linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In addition, increasing evidence from large scale case-control studies, genome-wide association studies, and meta-analyses of the literature suggest that polymorphisms of genes involved in one-carbon metabolism influence the levels of folate, homocysteine and vitamin B12, and might be among AD risk factors. We analyzed a dataset of 30 genetic and biochemical variables (folate, homocysteine, vitamin B12, and 27 genotypes generated by nine common biallelic polymorphisms of genes involved in folate metabolism) obtained from 40 late-onset AD patients and 40 matched controls to assess the predictive capacity of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in distinguish consistently these two different conditions and to identify the variables expressing the maximal amount of relevant information to the condition of being affected by dementia of Alzheimer’s type. Moreover, we constructed a semantic connectivity map to offer some insight regarding the complex biological connections among the studied variables and the two conditions (being AD or control). TWIST system, an evolutionary algorithm able to remove redundant and noisy information from complex data sets, selected 16 variables that allowed specialized ANNs to discriminate between AD and control subjects with over 90% accuracy. The semantic connectivity map provided important information on the complex biological connections among one-carbon metabolic variables highlighting those most closely linked to the AD condition."

In viral vectored vaccines, strong recombinant antigen expression and timing of expression influence the quantity and quality of the immune response. Screening of synthetic and native poxvirus promoters for strong protein expression in vitro and potent immune responses in vivo led to the identification of the MVA13.5L promoter, a unique and novel naturally occurring tandem promoter in MVA composed of two 44 nucleotide long repeated motifs, each containing an early promoter element. The MVA13.5L gene is highly conserved across orthopoxviruses, yet its function is unknown. The unique structure of its promoter is not found for any other gene in the MVA genome and is also conserved in other orthopoxviruses. Comparison of the MVA13.5L promoter activity with synthetic poxviral promoters revealed that the MVA13.5L promoter produced higher levels of protein early during infection in HeLa cells and particularly in MDBK cells, a cell line in which MVA replication stops at an early stage before the expression of late genes. Finally, a recombinant antigen expressed under the control of this novel promoter induced high antibody titers and increased CD8 T cell responses in homologous prime-boost immunization compared to commonly used promoters. In particular, the recombinant antigen specific CD8 T cell responses dominated over the immunodominant B8R vector-specific responses after three vaccinations and even more during the memory phase. These results have identified the native MVA13.5L promoter as a new potent promoter for use in MVA vectored preventive and therapeutic vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2137158091,"Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) represent a new class of photoreceptors which support a variety of non-image forming physiological functions, such as circadian photoentrainment, pupillary light reflex and masking responses to light. In view of the recently proposed role of retinal inputs for the regulation of diurnal and nocturnal behavior, we performed the first deep analysis of the ipRGC system in a diurnal rodent model, Arvicanthisansorgei, and compared the anatomical and physiological properties of ipRGCs with those of nocturnal mice. Based on somata location, stratification pattern and melanopsin expression, we identified two main ipRGC types in the retina of Arvicanthis: M1, constituting 74% of all ipRGCs and non-M1 (consisting mainly of the M2 type) constituting the following 25%. The displaced ipRGCs were rarely encountered. Phenotypical staining patterns of ganglion cell markers showed a preferential expression of Brn3 and neurofilaments in non-M1 ipRGCs. In general, the anatomical properties and molecular phenotyping of ipRGCs in Arvicanthis resemble ipRGCs of the mouse retina, however the percentage of M1 cells is considerably higher in the diurnal animal. Multi-electrode array recordings (MEA) identified in newborn retinas of Arvicanthis three response types of ipRGCs (type I, II and III) which are distinguished by their light sensitivity, response strength, latency and duration. Type I ipRGCs exhibited a high sensitivity to short light flashes and showed, contrary to mouse type I ipRGCs, robust light responses to 10 ms flashes. The morphological, molecular and physiological analysis reveals very few differences between mouse and Arvicanthis ipRGCs. These data imply that the influence of retinal inputs in defining the temporal niche could be related to a stronger cone input into ipRGCs in the cone-rich Arvicanthis retina, and to the higher sensitivity of type I ipRGCs and elevated proportion of M1 cells."

However, the mechanism of antifungal action of antifungalmycin 702 remains unknown. Antifungalmycin 702 strongly inhibited mycelial growth and sclerotia formation/germination of Rhizoctonia solani. When treated with antifungalmycin 702, the hyphae morphology of R. solani became more irregular. The membrane and the cellular organelles were disrupted and there were many vacuoles in the cellular space. The lesion in the plasma membrane was detected through the increase of membrane permeability, lipid peroxidation and leakage of cell constituents. In summary, antifungalmycin 702 may exert its antifungal activity against R. solani by changing the structure of cell membranes and the cytoskeleton and interacting with the organelles."
https://openalex.org/W2006750556,"The non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) is an important mediator of signal transduction in B cells. By acting downstream of the B-cell antigen receptor, Syk promotes signaling pathways involved in proliferation, differentiation and survival of B cells. To study the oncogenic potential of Syk, we generated a mouse model for the inducible expression of the leukemia-derived TEL-Syk fusion protein exhibiting constitutive kinase activity. To achieve B-cell-specific expression of TEL-Syk in adult mice, we used a tamoxifen-inducible Cre mouse line. This study shows that inducible expression of TEL-Syk in B cells leads to transient proliferation and subsequent plasma cell differentiation. However, it does not lead to B-cell transformation. Instead, Syk activation induces the tumor suppressor B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), which interferes with the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Combined induction of TEL-Syk with transgenic expression of Bcl-2 results in a severe phenotype and plasma cell expansion. Our results suggest that deregulated Syk activity by itself is not sufficient for the transformation of B cells, as downstream effectors, such as Blimp-1, limit the survival and expansion of the activated B cell."

Although the actual biological role of Polι remains enigmatic, we have identified its coding gene as a candidate for pulmonary adenoma resistance 2 (Par2), a mouse quantitative trait locus modulating chemically induced lung tumor susceptibility. Notably, the most tumor-sensitive Par2 allele possessed by the 129X1/SvJ mouse is associated with a loss-of-function mutation in Polι. To determine whether the nonfunctional Polι is responsible for the 129X1/SvJ-specific Par2 phenotype, we knocked out Polι in a C57BL/6J mouse carrying a less tumor-sensitive Par2 allele. Disruption of the C57BL/6J Polι conferred 129X1/SvJ-like sensitivity on the C57BL/6J Par2 locus and increased the in vivo mutation frequency in the lung, providing definitive proof that Polι causes the Par2 effect and inhibits tumorigenesis and mutagenesis, despite its extreme replication infidelity."

After angiographic lesion evaluation PTA with or without stent placement was performed. Technical success was recorded. Clinical outcome post-treatment was assessed at three months post-intervention and was classified as: 1) complete relief of symptoms, 2) partial relief, or 3) no relief of symptoms. Complications during follow-up were recorded.Forty-four lesions in 34 symptomatic patients were treated with PTA. Eight lesions were treated with additional stent placement. Technical success was achieved in 40/44 lesions (91%). Three procedure-related minor complications occurred, i.e. asymptomatic conservatively treated intimal dissections. After a median of 2.9 months, patients experienced no relief of symptoms in 7/34 cases (21%), partial relief in 14/34 cases (41%), and complete relief in 13/34 cases (38%). Six patients required a reintervention during follow-up.Endovascular treatment of IIA stenosis has a high technical success rate and a low complication rate.

We have generated a transgenic mouse model that ubiquitously expresses a tri-fusion reporter gene (fluc2-tdTomato-ttk) driven by a constitutive chicken β-actin promoter. This “Tri-Modality Reporter Mouse” system allows one to isolate most cells from this donor mouse and image them for bioluminescent (fluc2), fluorescent (tdTomato), and positron emission tomography (PET) (ttk) modalities. Transgenic colonies with different levels of tri-fusion reporter gene expression showed a linear correlation between all three-reporter proteins (R2=0.89 for TdTomato vs Fluc, R2=0.94 for Fluc vs TTK, R2=0.89 for TdTomato vs TTK) in vitro from tissue lysates and in vivo by optical and PET imaging. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from this transgenics showed high level of reporter gene expression, which linearly correlated with the cell numbers (R2=0.99 for bioluminescence imaging (BLI)). Both BLI (R2=0.93) and micro-PET (R2=0.94) imaging of the subcutaneous implants of Tri-Modality Reporter Mouse derived MSCs in nude mice showed linear correlation with the cell numbers and across different imaging modalities (R2=0.97). Serial imaging of MSCs transplanted to mice with acute myocardial infarction (MI) by intramyocardial injection exhibited significantly higher signals in MI heart at days 2, 3, 4, and 7 (p<0.01). MSCs transplanted to the ischemic hindlimb of nude mice showed significantly higher BLI and PET signals in the first 2 weeks that dropped by 4th week due to poor cell survival. However, laser Doppler perfusion imaging revealed that blood circulation in the ischemic limb was significantly improved in the MSCs transplantation group compared with the control group.

Perhaps reflecting their many functions, they occur at multiple sites of the cell. In this study, we focused on the nuclear-localizing ability of the smaller C protein, Y1, and found that this translocation is mediated by Ran GTPase but not by passive diffusion, and that basic residues within the 149-157 amino acid region are critical for that. The mechanism of inhibition of interferon (IFN)-signaling seemed to differ between the C and Y1 proteins, since deletion of 12 C-terminal amino acids resulted in a loss of the function for the C but not for the Y1 protein. The ability of Y1 mutants to inhibit IFN-α-induced, ISRE-driven expression of a reporter gene almost paralleled with that to localize in the nucleus. These results suggest that nuclear localization of the Y1 protein might be important for the inhibitory effect on type-I IFN-stimulated gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1978528817,"An increasing number of studies indicate that not only females but also males can be selective when choosing a mate. In species exhibiting male or mutual mate choice, females may benefit from being attractive. While male attractiveness is often positively influenced by higher plasma levels of the androgenic hormone testosterone, it has been shown that testosterone can masculinise female behavior and morphology in several bird species, potentially rendering them less attractive. In this study, we investigated whether female budgerigars, Melopsittacusundulatus, suffer from increased plasma testosterone levels through a negative effect on their attractiveness to males. We experimentally increased plasma testosterone levels in testosterone-treated females (T-females) compared to controls (C-females) and allowed males to choose between a T- and a C-female in a two-way choice situation. Although testosterone treatment significantly affected female behavioral and morphological characteristics, males did not show a significant difference in preference between T- and C-females. These results suggest that experimentally increasing testosterone levels in females does not appear to influence male preference during initial mate choice. Our findings indicate that selection for higher levels of testosterone in male budgerigars is probably not constrained by a correlated response to selection causing negative effects on female attractiveness during initial mate choice. Evaluating whether or not a potential constraint may arise from negative testosterone-induced effects on other fitness related traits in females requires further work."
