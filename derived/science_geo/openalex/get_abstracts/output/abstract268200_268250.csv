https://openalex.org/W2039630413,"The process of polar auxin transport, central to a plant's auxin relations, can be inhibited by a group of synthetic compounds that apparently act by binding to a plasma membrane protein known as the naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) receptor. No endogenous ligand to the NPA receptor, capable of affecting polar auxin transport in plants, has yet been found. It is now shown that a group of flavonoids-including quercetin, apigenin, and kaempferol-can specifically compete with [(3)H]NPA for binding to its receptor and can perturb auxin transport in a variety of plant tissues and transport systems in a manner closely paralleling the action of synthetic transport inhibitors. Because the active flavonoids are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and exert their effects at micromolar concentrations approximating likely endogenous levels, they may act as natural auxin transport regulators in plants."

Diatom production peaked from 1820 to 1850 in Lake Ontario, at about 1880 in Lake Erie, but not until 1970 in Lake Michigan. This is the first reported sediment record of the silica-depletion sequence for the Great Lakes."
https://openalex.org/W2027622689,"Easterly trade winds from near-equatorial islands in the central Pacific weakened before each El Niño between 1950 and 1978, except for the 1963 El Niño. The weakening of the easterlies and their later collapse did not occur uniformly over several months, but rather through a series of strong westerly wind bursts lasting 1 to 3 weeks. The bursts may force equatorial Kelvin waves in the ocean that can both initiate and sustain the sea surface warming characteristics of El Niño events."
https://openalex.org/W2004336154,"High-density demersal layers of krill have been detected in the submarine canyons off Georges Bank by means of a high-frequency, dual-beam bioacoustical technique. Krill densities in these demersal layers were observed to be two to three orders of magnitude greater than the highest densities observed in water-column scattering layers. Such abundances may help explain the unusually high squid and demersal fish production estimates attributed to the Georges Bank ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2017108766,"The eruption of El Chichón Volcano in March and April 1982 resulted in the nucleation of large numbers of new sulfuric acid droplets and an increase by nearly an order of magnitude in the size of the preexisting particles in the stratosphere. Nearly 10(7) metric tons of sulfuric acid remained in the stratosphere by the end of 1982, about 40 times as much as was deposited by Mount St. Helens in 1980."
https://openalex.org/W2023438183,"A monomeric arsinogallane containing a covalent gallium-arsenic bond has been prepared, and its molecular structure has been determined by x-ray crystallography. The compound reacted with tert-butanol at ambient temperature to yield the III-V semiconductor gallium arsenide as a finely divided amorphous solid. During the initial stages of the reaction small clusters of gallium arsenide were apparently present in solution. The band gaps of these particles, as observed by their absorption spectra, were larger than that of the bulk material. This work is a step toward the development of new molecular precursors for technologically important materials and the study of quantum size effects in small semiconductor particles."
https://openalex.org/W2075374302,"Large trade deficits and the corresponding increase in U.S. international indebtedness have raised concerns about the long-run competitiveness of the United States. But being competitive requires more than balance in our foreign trade; it requires an improving standard of living. The long-term U.S. competitive problem is largely caused by low saving rates, high costs of capital, and the resulting inadequate level of both visible and invisible investment. As long as the U.S. national saving rate remains far below that of all our major competitor nations, there is little chance for restoring America's international economic position."
https://openalex.org/W2040283032,"There are various ways of looking at economic competitiveness. Some of the popular conceptions of America's relative position are clarified by examining the concept in terms of wage cost, productivity, profit margins, and exchange rates. A quantitative approach is laid out and examined in relation to similar measures for other countries. Also some relationships between competitiveness and the external deficit on current account for the United States are analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2086219003,"Solar photovoltaic technology is receiving increasing attention as a prospective source of bulk, electric utility power within the next 10 to 20 years. Successful development will require solar energy conversion efficiencies of about 15 percent for photovoltaic flat-plate modules, or about 25 percent for photovoltaic cells using highly concentrated sunlight. Three different cell technologies have a better than even chance of achieving these target efficiencies with costs and operating lifetimes that would allow significant use by electric utilities. The challenge for the next decade is to push photovoltaic technology to its physical limits while expanding markets and user confidence with currently available systems."
https://openalex.org/W2121502459,"Changes in the ground surface tilt and in the rate of seismicity indicate that an aseismic deformation event may have occurred between 1978 and 1980 along the plate boundary in the eastern Aleutians, Alaska, within the Shumagin seismic gap. Pavlof Volcano was unusually quiescent during this period. The proposed event would cause an increase of stress on the shallow locked portion of the plate boundary, bringing it closer to rupture in a great earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W2034543386,"The United States still is a leader in technology and innovation, but American industry has been slow to translate that advantage into commercial success. A major contributing factor is the low status accorded manufacturing in this country and a lack of teamwork among scientists, engineers, and managers. However, there are encouraging signs that these key players in the innovation cycle are recognizing the need to work together to improve products and manufacturing processes and to restore the competitive position of the United States."

https://openalex.org/W2079931657,"James H. Oliver, Jr.’s Policy Forum “Crisis in biosystematics of arthropods” (20 May, p. 967) would have the scientific community do the right deed for the wrong reason. Systematics is not simply the identification of specimens, it is the reconstruction of evolutionary history; and it should be supported not just because it has practical applications (which it does) but because it is a fundamental scientific discipline. Systematics is important because all living things are the product of history, and we can understand little about the diversity of organisms without knowledge of their history— the phylogenetic knowledge provided by systematics (1). One might just as well try to understand the current political conflicts in Central America or the Middle East without understanding the history of the people of those areas. Oliver correctly deplores the placement of major systematics collections in “maintenance storage,” and we further deplore the disposal of other collections (2) and the retreat of university biology departments into nonevolutionary disciplines. Many of the biological “laws” that such disciplines discover may be bounded by clade and place, and only systematic research—research on evolutionary history—can discover those bounds. Other recent calls for the support of systematics (3) have also emphasized its practical and cataloging aspects. We agree strongly that systematics is insufficiently supported, but we fear that these arguments based exclusively on “usefulness” will backfire in the long run. Systematics will not attract the brightest students—the true innovators of theory and practice—if it is portrayed as an identification service. Systematics must command attention because of the intellectual challenge it represents, in and of itself, as the study of evolutionary history. ROBERT J. O’HARA DAVID R.

https://openalex.org/W2112693715,"Magnetic field records at the earth's surface contain the effects of a variety of different source currents flowing in outer space. During the last decade, several computational techniques for the use of magnetometer data have been proposed to obtain the global pattern of the electric fields and currents and Joule heating in the ionosphere. The numerical algorithm has now been enormously improved, such that simultaneous more direct or in situ measurements by satellites and radars can be incorporated into the scheme. In particular, owing to recent progress in satellite-viewed auroral images, it is possible to estimate ""instantaneous"" patterns of the ionospheric electrodynamic quantities over the entire polar region with a time resolution of several minutes. This report demonstrates that, contrary to our conventional views, large ionospheric currents can flow in regions of low auroral activity."
