https://openalex.org/W1533085219,"Abstract The deoxyribonuclease controlled by the recB and recC loci of Escherichia coli K-12 has been purified to near homogeneity. It is composed of two nonidentical polypeptide chains with a combined molecular weight of approximately 270,000. In the presence of ATP the enzyme hydrolyzes linear duplex or single stranded DNA in an exonucleolytic manner to 5'-phosphoryl-terminated oligonucleotides of an average length of 4.5. The enzyme can also cleave single stranded DNA endonucleolytically, being stimulated 7-fold by ATP in this reaction. However, no nuclease activity is observed on closed circular duplex DNA. In the course of exonuclease digestion more than 20 ATP molecules are hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate for each DNA phosphodiester bond broken. There is no ATP hydrolysis in the absence of degradable DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1524124774,"Proteolysis of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (mol wt 109,000) yields two fragments: a large fragment (mol wt 76,000) which retains polymerase and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities, and a small fragment (mol wt 36,000) which retains only the 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activity. The large fragment has been obtained in two ways: by cleavage of the intact enzyme with subtilisin or other proteases, and by isolation from E. coli extracts, presumably after proteolysis had occurred in the extract. The large fragment carries out DNA synthesis on nicked double-stranded DNA without degradation of the strand ahead of the growing point, and catalyzes a 3′ → 5′ exonuclease action on both single- and doublestranded DNA with production of nucleoside monophosphates. The large fragment is inactive in unprimed poly[d(A-T)] synthesis, but catalyzes primed poly[d(A - T)] synthesis at a relatively linear rate generating poly[d(A-T)] molecules up to 10 µm in length. The single cysteine residue and the single disulfide group of the intact enzyme are retained in the large fragment as are the binding sites for a deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate and a 3′-hydroxyl ribonucleotide (primer terminus)."
https://openalex.org/W1569753682,"Abstract Fluorescence emission spectra of the oxidized and reduced forms of thioredoxin (thioredoxin-S2 and thioredoxin-(SH)2, respectively) from Escherichia coli were determined at varying pH, solvent composition, and concentration of urea or guanidine hydrochloride. Thioredoxin-S2, with only 2 tryptophan residues at positions 28 and 31, showed a strongly quenched tryptophan fluorescence (Q = 0.02) which remained constant from pH 2 to pH 10. Addition of ethanol or dioxan up to 50% (v/v) at pH 7.0 did not perturb the tryptophan emission. Guanidine hydrochloride from 2 to 4 m increased the fluorescence intensity of thioredoxin-S2 3-fold and the emission maximum was shifted from 342 nm to 355 nm indicating unfolding of the protein. The beginning of this reversible transition was also observed in 6 m urea. Between 4 to 7 m guanidine only a small increase in tryptophan fluorescence occurred, indicating that thioredoxin-S2 was largely unfolded. Thioredoxin-(SH)2, obtained by chemical reduction of thioredoxin-S2 by dithiothreitol, showed a pronounced pH dependence of fluorescence with a maximum at pH 5, where the emission intensity was 6.5-fold higher than that of thioredoxin-S2. The fluorescence intensity decreased on the alkaline side of pH 5 and seemed to fit a titration curve with an apparent pK of 6.75. Between 0 to 2 m guanidine hydrochloride the fluorescence intensity for thioredoxin-(SH)2 increased almost 2-fold in a transition not observed with thioredoxin-S2. Between 2 to 4 m guanidine the fluorescence intensity decreased in a transition similar to the increase in intensity for thioredoxin-S2. Under all experimental conditions, the tryptophan fluorescence intensity of thioredoxin-(SH)2 was higher than that of thioredoxin-S2, suggesting that the disulfide bond of thioredoxin-S2 was an important quenching group. The fluorescence emission spectrum of yeast thioredoxin, which has a single tryptophan residue in a position homologous to Trp-31 of E. coli thioredoxin, showed a low quantum yield, (Q = 0.03), of tryptophan fluorescence in its oxidized form. Reduction of the disulfide bond increased the fluorescence intensity 1.2-fold. This suggests that the conformational change which accompanies reduction of thioredoxin-S2 from E. coli has its main effect on the emission of Trp-28."
https://openalex.org/W2168091367,"Abstract The biosynthesis of phospholipids in Escherichia coli is catalyzed by enzymes most of which are associated with the bacterial membrane. In the present work, it has been found that the enzyme CDP-diglyceride: l-serine phosphatidyltransferase (phosphatidylserine synthetase) is exceptional in that it is not bound to membrane fragments in cell-free extracts of E. coli, but is predominantly associated with ribosomes. The enzyme resists extraction from ribosomes in buffers of high ionic strength. When ribosomes were allowed to dissociate in buffers containing low concentrations of magnesium, the enzyme was associated with both 50 and 30 S subunits. Phosphatidylserine is found only in trace amounts in E. coli, being rapidly converted to phosphatidylethanolamine by a decarboxylase which is a membrane-bound enzyme. Despite the apparently different intracellular localization of the two enzymes, their function in vivo must be tightly coupled. When the decarboxylase in living cells of E. coli was inhibited by the addition of hydroxylamine to the medium, phosphatidyl[1-14C]serine was shown to accumulate within 1 min. In the control cells, in which the decarboxylase was not inhibited, no labeled phosphatidylserine could be detected, showing that the decarboxylation of the newly formed phosphatidylserine must take place without detectable time lag."
https://openalex.org/W1522220566,Abstract We have investigated the mechanism of action of the gene 6 exonuclease of bacteriophage T7. The enzyme hydrolyzes duplex DNA until about 50% of the DNA is acid soluble. The remaining acid-insoluble DNA is single stranded and the acid-soluble product is almost entirely 5'-mononucleotides. The enzyme begins its exonucleolytic attack at the 5' terminus of DNA and hydrolyzes 5'-phosphoryl terminated and 5'-hydroxyl terminated DNA at equal rates. The exonuclease releases a dinucleoside monophosphate from a 5'-hydroxyl terminus and is able to release from one chain of DNA and begin hydrolysis of another before completion of hydrolysis. The enzyme is able to initiate hydrolysis at nicks as well as at external termini. The gene 6 exonuclease is involved in the acid solubilization of bacterial DNA after T7 phage infection. The enzyme may also be involved in other processes such as genetic recombination.

Mutants lacking each of these activities have been isolated and were found to complement each other."

https://openalex.org/W1523959680,"Abstract Incomplete β-galactosidase polypeptide chains made by nonsense mutant strains of Escherichia coli were measured quantitatively by treatment of extracts with BrCN followed by complementation with an excess of an extract of a deletion mutant strain. Rates of synthesis were determined in cells grown in the presence of inducer, and rates of degradation were determined in cells grown after removal of inducer. Incomplete chains are degraded at different rates which are not directly proportional to their length but are apparently determined by their conformation. The degradation system is temperature dependent and is more active during growth. Synthesis of the different chains occurs at similar rates indicating no polar effect within the gene. The difference in rates of degradation is a primary cause of the variation in levels of cross-reacting material in these strains."
https://openalex.org/W1539799880,"Abstract The small fragment (mol wt 36,000) produced by the limited proteolytic cleavage of DNA polymerase (mol wt 109,000) retains only the 5' → 3' exonuclease activity. The small fragment resembles the 5' → 3' exonuclease of the intact enzyme in degrading DNA to mono- and oligonucleotides and in its capacity to excise mismatched regions such as thymine dimers. It differs from the intact enzyme in that deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, which support polymerization, fail to stimulate the exonuclease or to increase the proportion of oligonucleotides among the products. However with a mixture of small fragment, large fragment (mol wt 76,000; polymerase and 3' → 5' exonuclease functions), nicked DNA, and suitable deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, the same influences of polymerization on 5' → 3' exonucleases are seen as with the intact enzyme. Thus at the locus of a nick in DNA, the two fragments bind adjacent to one another to perform the coordinated polymerization—5' → 3' exonuclease functions that characterize the intact enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1496752641,"During anaerobic growth, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lose their normal mitochondria and accumulate respiration-deficient promitochondria. Upon aeration of the anaerobically grown cells, the promitochondria are converted to respiring mitochondria. The present study investigates the role of promitochondrial protein synthesis in this conversion. The proteins synthesized by promitochondria in vivo were selectively labeled by incubating the cells with radioactive leucine in the presence of cycloheximide. This antibiotic selectively inhibits cytoplasmic protein synthesis, and thereby prevents the oxygen-induced conversion of promitochondria to mitochondria. Electrophoretic comparison of the polypeptides labeled in the presence and absence of oxygen revealed that oxygen controlled the promitochondrial synthesis of a specific class of proteins. This effect of oxygen was inhibited by glucose. During respiratory adaptation, the promitochondrial protein-synthesizing system can thus respond to oxygen and to glucose independently of cytoplasmic protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1539765398,"Abstract The structure of an ornithine-containing lipid from Thiobacillus thiooxidans has been elucidated. Methanolysis of the lipid released methyl cis-11,12-methylene-2-hydroxy-octadecanoate. Acid hydrolysis of the residue yielded ornithine and a mixture of fatty acids, the major components of which were 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic and 2-hexadecenoic acids. Identification of the 3-hydroxy fatty acid was based on the thin layer chromatographic mobilities of the acid, its methyl ester, the methyl ether, and acetate derivatives of its methyl ester, on the equivalent chain lengths of the derivatives of the acid and the acid obtained by oxidation of the natural acid with permanganate, and on mass spectral studies. Similar techniques were used for the identification of 2-hexadecenoic acid. The minor fatty acids and the 2-hexadecenoic acid were found to be degradation products of the 3-hydroxy acid. A 1:1:1 molar ratio was determined for the three lipid components, ornithine, cis-11,12-methylene-2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, and 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid. Evidence for an ester linkage between the carboxyl group of the 2-hydroxy fatty acid and the hydroxyl group of the 3-hydroxy acid was obtained by infrared spectra, degradation of 14C-labeled lipid, and reactions of the lipid with NaOCH3 and NH2OH. The 3-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid was determined to be attached to the α-amino group of ornithine through an amide bond. This conclusion was supported by the conditions necessary to achieve hydrolysis, infrared spectra, end group analysis with dansyl chloride, and nonaqueous titrations. Data obtained in this investigation indicated that the δ-amino group and the carboxyl group of ornithine were free and that the extracted lipid existed as a zwitterion. Elemental analysis and unit weight determinations were consistent with the proposed structure."
https://openalex.org/W1545126128,"Abstract Acetate kinase (ATP:acetate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.1) can be phosphorylated with ATP or with acetyl phosphate. The degree of phosphorylation increases with the relative concentration of phosphorylating agent. The isolated phosphoenzyme reacts quantitatively with ADP to form ATP, and with acetate to form acetyl phosphate in 70 to 80% yield. The pH stability profile of the phosphoenzyme at 37° has a U shape characteristic of acyl phosphates. Neutral hydroxylamine at 26° reacts rapidly (10 min) with the phosphoenzyme to effect the quantitative release of orthophosphate. These properties intimate that the phosphoryl group of the phosphoenzyme is linked covalently to a carboxyl function of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2049500722,"THE potential for the formation of N-nitrosamines in the human environment, either during the processing of foods or in vivo from nitrate and/or nitrite, and precursor amines has received considerable attention in recent years. Traditionally only secondary amines were thought to undergo N-nitrosation reactions. While secondary amines per se are not common in biological systems, tertiary amines and quaternary ammonium compounds do occur in plant and animal tissue. The possible formation of N-nitrosamines from these compounds must be considered because recent reports have appeared on the nitrosation of trimethylamine1,2 and trimethylamine oxide1 in connexion with the possible formation of N-nitrosamines in fish products cured with nitrate. The nitrosative cleavage of tertiary amines is not new and has been described before3,4."
https://openalex.org/W1593693172,"Abstract The amino acid sequences around two sites reactive with the specific pepsin inactivator, 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane, were determined to be: Sequence I, Phe-Glu-Gly-Met-Asp-Val-Pro-Thr-Ser-Ser-Gly-Glu-Leu; Sequence II, Ile-Val-Asp-Thr-Gly-Ser-Ser-Asn. Epoxide-modified pepsin was digested separately by proteases and the epoxide-modified peptides were purified by Sephadex column chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis. When the sequences of the peptides were determined, they fell into one of the two groups shown above—Sequence I or Sequence II. The modification in Sequence I, occurring at the methionyl residue, represented an alkylation by the epoxide to form a sulfonium salt. This methionine residue is located 38 residues from the COOH terminus of pepsin. The modification of the β-carboxyl group of the aspartyl residue in Sequence II was an esterification reaction. The location of this aspartyl residue in the primary structure of pepsin is uncertain. Extensive homology exists between the epoxide-modified aspartyl Sequence II and the previously reported diazo-reactive aspartyl sequence. The sequence confirmed data from a previous study (Tang, J. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 4510) which indicated that 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane reacts with two main sites of pepsin and that these sites differ from those reactive with diazo and p-bromophenacyl bromide inactivators of pepsin."
https://openalex.org/W1665922368,"Abstract Modification of a single carboxylate side chain in pepsin by 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane abolished enzymic activity. The degree of inactivation was related to incorporation of the modifier in a 1:1 molar ratio. The essential residue was an aspartic acid which is contained in the amino acid sequence Ile-Val-Asp-Thr-Gly-Ser-Ser-Asn. The pH rate profile of enzymic inactivation suggested the pKa of the active carboxylate ion to be below pH 3. Rate constants for the reaction of the 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane with water, citrate ion, and pepsin and for the reaction of propylene oxide with pepsin were determined. Evaluation of these rate constants allowed some quantitative determination of the effect of affinity labeling in this system and of the nucleophilic character of the reactive carboxylate ion. In the light of these experiments and information available in the literature, potential mechanisms for pepsin catalysis are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1508794346,"Abstract Concentrative uptake of 16 amino acids by membrane vesicles isolated from Staphylococcus aureus is stimulated 3 to 100 times by the conversion of l-α-glycerol phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. With the exception of ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate, d-lactate, phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP, and a number of other metabolites and cofactors do not replace α-glycerol phosphate. Amino acid transport by these membrane preparations in the presence of α-glycerol phosphate requires oxygen, and is blocked by potassium cyanide, sodium azide, and dinitrophenol; however, uptake is not significantly inhibited by high concentrations of arsenate. Vesicles contain insignificant amounts of ATP; and the level of ATP is not increased by incubation in the presence of α-glycerol phosphate or NADH. The membrane-bound α-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase is coupled to oxygen via a cytochrome system also present in the vesicle membrane, and spectrophotometric evidence shows that α-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase, NADH dehydrogenase, l-lactic dehydrogenase, and succinic dehydrogenase all utilize the same cytochrome system. There is no relationship between rates of oxidation of electron donors by the respiratory chain (NADH g α-glycerol phosphate >> l-lactatesuccinate) and the ability of these compounds to stimulate amino acid transport. N-Ethylmaleimide and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate inhibit amino acid transport and α-glycerol phosphate oxidation. However, N-ethyl-maleimide does not significantly inhibit α-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase with dichlorophenolindophenol as an artificial acceptor, nor does it inhibit oxygen utilization in the presence of NADH. These findings indicate that the site of coupling of α-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase to amino acid transport lies between the primary dehydrogenase and the cytochrome chain. It is concluded that amino acid transport in S. aureus is catalyzed by mechanisms similar to those found in Escherichia coli with the exception that α-glycerol phosphate, rather than d-lactate, is the primary electron donor."

https://openalex.org/W1502168313,"An 11-residue peptic peptide from the catalytic center of Escherichia coli lipoamide dehydrogenase has been isolated and sequenced. This peptide contains the oxidation-reduction active disulfide of the enzyme which functions in concert with the flavin during catalysis. The peptide was isolated from a digest of a derivative in which the free sulfhydryls of the enzyme were substituted with the colored maleimide N-(4-dimethylamino-3,5-dinitrophenyl)maleimide. The sequence of the peptide was determined by a subtractive Edman degradation to be: [see PDF for sequence] This work suggests that the oxidation-reduction active disulfide of E. coli lipoamide dehydrogenase is contained in a hydrophobic pocket at the catalytic center of the enzyme, consistent with the binding of the nonpolar substrate dihydrolipoamide.

https://openalex.org/W1582972277,"Abstract A phospholipid-requiring membrane enzyme of Salmonella typhimurium was isolated. The purified enzyme (UDP-glucose:lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase I) catalyzed transfer of glucosyl residues from uridine diphosphoglucose to the glucose-deficient lipopolysaccharide of a mutant strain (S. typhimurium SL1032) deficient in the glucosyltransferase. The glucosylated product of the reaction was a substrate for UDP-galactose:lipopolysaccharide α,3-galactosyltransferase, the next enzyme in the series of membrane-bound transferase enzymes that together catalyze the sequential addition of sugar residues during biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide. Phospholipid was required for activity of both transferases and phosphatidylethanolamine was the most effective phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1653457708,"Absence of 6-phosphogluconolactonase alone slightly decreases the growth rate of Escherichia coli on glucose. In such a strain there is considerable, and possibly normal, use of the oxidative hexose monophosphate shunt, according to ribose specific activity after growth on [1-14C]glucose. Thus, absence of lactonase, even in a strain with genetic deletion of lactonase, does not block the shunt. A strain which lacks both phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase does not grow at all on glucose. A strain lacking isomerase and lactonase, however, does grow very slowly on glucose. Thus the shunt can function as the sole pathway of glucose metabolism in a lactonase mutant. Metabolism of 6-phosphogluconolactone past the enzyme block of the mutant probably occurs mainly by spontaneous hydrolysis, giving the normal product, gluconate 6-phosphate. However, some metabolism uses a new sequence of reactions bypassing the lactonase: dephosphorylation and excretion of gluconolactone, hydrolysis of the gluconolactone in the medium, and uptake and phosphorylation of the gluconic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1556800439,"Abstract Several different Escherichia coli K-12 strains have been investigated for evidence of control of fatty acid metabolism in response to exogenous fatty acid supplementation. [14C]-Acetate incorporation into lipid was used to identify the synthesized fatty acids recovered from the cell and the culture fluid. The identity and amounts (micrograms) of these fatty acids were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. When oleic acid is present in the growth medium as supplement, synthesized unsaturated fatty acids decrease in the cultures of two strains; furthermore, turnover of synthesized fatty acids via β oxidation can not occur in one of these strains. Taken together, these observations show that there is regulation of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in these two strains. A third strain shows a less well defined response to oleate supplementation while an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph from this strain clearly accumulated saturated and β-hydroxy fatty acids. The difference between strains with respect to regulation of synthesis may be explained partly in terms of differences in the β oxidation activities of the cells. The composition of the synthesized fatty acids recovered from the medium is consistent with the release of lipopolysaccharide and phospholipid from the outer membrane of the cell envelope."

https://openalex.org/W1486889119,"Abstract Sodium borohydride-reduced, carboxymethylated holotryptophanase was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were purified by column chromatography on basic and acidic ion exchange resins, and by paper chromatography and electrophoresis. The isolation and sequence determinations of 13 peptides, including the NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides, those containing carboxymethylcysteine or tryptophan, and that containing the pyridoxyllysine residue (Lys(Pxy)) are reported here, together with a summary of the sequences of a total of 54 tryptic peptides present in the digest. The NH2-terminal peptide, Met-Glu-Asn-Phe-Lys, and the COOH-terminal peptide, Leu-Lys-Glu-Val, were isolated, and an extended sequence at the COOH-terminal end of tryptophanase was proposed to be His-Thr-Phe-Ala-Lys-Leu-Lys-Glu-Val on the basis of carboxypeptidase A experiments and the sequence of an isolated pentapeptide. The amino acid sequence of an extended portion of the peptide chain around the reduced pyridoxal 5-phosphate residue was determined to be Tyr-Ala-Asp-Met-Leu-Ala-Met-SerAla-Lys-Lys(Pxy)-Asp-Ala-Met-Val-Pro-Met-Gly-Gly-Leu-Leu-Cys(Cm)-Met-Lys. Tryptophanase contains 2 tryptophan and 6 cystine residues per subunit of 55,000 molecular weight, and two distinct tryptophan peptides and five distinct carboxymethylcysteine peptides were isolated and sequenced. The studies thus support the view that this subunit contains a single peptide chain. Of a total of about 474 amino acid residues per subunit, 411 were recovered in the 54 tryptic peptides so far studied."

https://openalex.org/W1492226052,"Abstract Ultraviolet irradiation of thymidine kinase with light primarily of 253.7 nm wave length results in a loss of catalytic activity at a rate that follows first order inactivation kinetics. Ultraviolet irradiation does not alter the sigmoidal nature of the ATP saturating curve, the sensitivity of the enzyme to the allosteric regulators (dCDP or dTTP), or the Km for thymidine and 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine. Catalytic activity is not restored by postirradiation incubation with substrate. The ultraviolet sensitivity of thymidine kinase is altered by the presence of molecules that interact with this enzyme and affect its catalytic activity. Regulatory deoxynucleotides (dTTP, dCDP) and normal substrates (ATP, thymidine) reduce the rate of inactivation. The photoreactive substrate 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine enhances the rate of loss of catalytic activity but does not alter the sensitivity of the allosteric activities to ultraviolet irradiation. The effect of ATP and thymidine concentration on the extent of protection closely parallels their effect on the rate of formation of thymidylate. The ultraviolet enhancement effect observed with 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine is a hyperbolic function of the concentration of this substrate, similar to the substrate saturation curve but displaced to higher concentrations by a factor of 2 or 3. The effect of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine can be prevented by the normal substrate thymidine. Furthermore, the thymidine protective effect and the 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine ultraviolet enhancement effect may be altered in a predictable fashion by the presence of the appropriate allosteric regulator; i.e. both effects are reduced by dTTP which decreases the enzymic affinity for substrate and are increased by dCDP which increases the enzymic affinity for substrate. It is postulated that photolysis of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine results in the formation of a deoxyuridine-free radical which when formed when the halogenated substrate is in the enzyme-substrate complex causes a modification in one or more of the amino acids at the active site vital for catalytic activity."

The experimental patterns of synthesis were consistent with a discontinuous mode of chromosome replication and an exponentially increasing rate of stable RNA synthesis. The rates of tRNA and rRNA synthesis relative to the rate of total stable RNA synthesis were constant during the cell division cycle and were not affected by replication of stable RNA cistrons.

Dissociation in urea of a complemented enzyme followed by centrifugation showed heterogeneity of the prematurely terminated fragment, suggesting that an exposed overlapping segment had been subjected to proteolysis. The amount of complemented enzyme formed varied from strain to strain and was dependent in part on the tertiary structure of the nonsense fragment itself.

https://openalex.org/W1601570931,"Abstract Pepsinogen reacts with gossypol to form gossypolpepsinogen, a zymogen which cannot be activated to pepsin. This modified protein was digested with Nagarse followed by partial acid hydrolysis with 0.03 n HCl at 110° for 40 hours. The gossypol-containing portion of the molecule was isolated and purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-15 and LH-20 columns and countercurrent distribution by means of a 1-butanol, pyridine, and acetic acid system. The material thus purified was found to be a decapeptide originating from the NH2-terminal portion of the protein and a heptapeptide obtained from the COOH terminus. The two peptides were cross-linked by gossypol through the e-NH2 groups of Lys18 and Lys358. As indicated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, it is apparent that intra- as well as intermolecular cross-linkages may occur. Furthermore, the optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism differ from those of pepsinogen."

https://openalex.org/W2206566392,"The biosynthesis of vitamin B6 was studied in an Escherichia coli mutant, blocked between pyridoxol and pyridoxal. Specific incorporation of glycerol, pyruvate, serine, and glucose was shown by chemical degradation of labeled samples of pyridoxol isolated from the medium of cultures which had been incubated with various 14C-labeled radiomers of these substrates. The observed pattern of incorporation of 14C shows that pyridoxol is derived from 3 triose units. One of these is incorporated by way of pyruvate, as a 2-carbon unit at the oxidation level of acetaldehyde. The other 2 triose units are incorporated intact. A hypothetical sequence for the biogenesis of pyridoxol is advanced on the basis of the tracer evidence. 5-Deoxyxylulose 1-phosphate and a branched chain 8-carbon sugar are postulated as intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1546266113,"Abstract A study of the limited peptic and tryptic fragmentation of intact type K Bence-Jones proteins into the variable and the constant halves showed a strong difference in the subsequent digestibility of the variable half and the constant half at different temperatures. The variable half was much more resistant to enzymatic digestion than the constant half at 37°, whereas the situation was reversed at 55°. This suggests that there is a larger contribution of hydrophobic bonds to the tertiary structure of the constant half than to the tertiary structure of the variable half and perhaps a greater contribution of salt linkages to the tertiary structure of the variable half. The temperature differential permits the easy preparation and isolation of the fragments of the variable and the constant halves since only the variable-half fragment and the remaining intact Bence-Jones protein are found in the digest after digestion at 37° and only the constant-half fragment is found after digestion at 55°."
https://openalex.org/W1513634663,"Abstract The histidyl-tRNA synthetase has been partially purified from five hisS mutants of Salmonella typhimurium and the kinetic constants compared to those previously obtained with the wild type enzyme. The mutants were selected on the basis of being derepressed for the histidine operon. Some of the mutant enzymes have markedly decreased affinities for histidine (one has a 36-fold decrease in affinity) and this has been correlated with the physiological behavior of the mutants. One of the mutant enzymes, that of hisS1587, has a markedly increased affinity for histidine and ATP and a 7-fold decreased affinity for tRNAhis. Another mutant enzyme, that of hisS2280, has normal affinities for histidine and for tRNAhis but a 5-fold decreased affinity for ATP. Analysis of the mutants has not helped to answer the question of whether the derepression of the histidine operon caused by altered synthetases is due solely to the decreased amount of aminoacylated tRNAhis in the cell, or whether the synthetase is also involved as a repressor in complex with charged tRNAhis."

Tetracycline inhibited mostly the binding of phenylalanyl-tRNA to the acceptor site, but the binding to the donor site may be inhibited at 13 mm Mg++. Puromycin reaction of phenylalanyl-tRNA bound to the donor site was inhibited by the presence of N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA at the acceptor site."
https://openalex.org/W1480557394,"Abstract The formation of 4-thiouridine through the transfer of sulfur from cysteine to a uridine in enzymatically activated tRNA is mediated in the Escherichia coli system by a sulfurtransferase which requires pyridoxal 5-phosphate. Resolution of the enzyme may be accomplished by hydroxylapatite chromatography. The sulfurtransferase is inactivated by incubation with hydroxylamine or potassium borohydride. It may be reactivated by a short treatment with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, but not pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, or pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. Incubation of the holoenzyme with amino acids leads to partial inactivation. This inactivation is alleviated if α-keto acids are present along with the amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1520395978,"Abstract A previously unidentified nonsaponifiable metabolite of p-hydroxybenzoate in liver slices, postulated to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, has been isolated. This metabolite, like ubiquinone, was labeled in liver slices when incubated with [U-14C]benzoate, 4-hydroxy[G-3H]benzoate, [Me-14C]methionine, and [2-14C]mevalonate. The time course of incorporation of radioactivity from benzoate into the unknown lipid and into ubiquinone was consistent with a precursor-product relationship between the 4-hydroxybenzoate metabolite and ubiquinone. This metabolite has been purified from the nonsaponifiable lipids of rat liver and analyzed by spectrometry. On the basis of its mass spectrum, ultraviolet absorption spectrum, and chromatographic properties, the unknown compound was identified as 5-demethoxyubiquinone-9 and its structure proven by synthesis. 5-Demethoxyubiquinone-6 and ubiquinone-6 were isolated from a crude sample of ubiquinone obtained from Saccharomyces cerevisae. Synthetic 5-demethoxyubiquinone-9, labeled in the methoxyl group with 3H, and the biosynthesized 5-demethoxyubiquinone-9, labeled with 14C in liver slices, were both converted to ubiquinone-9 by the isolated, perfused rat liver. It is concluded that the synthesis of ubiquinone-9 in rat liver occurs via 5-demethoxyubiquinone-9."
https://openalex.org/W1525244601,"Abstract The activated form of the mutationally altered alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli S-19 was found to be identical with the wild type enzyme with respect to the following properties: sedimentation coefficient, circular dichroic and optical rotatory dispersion spectra, heat stability, broad substrate specificity, Km for 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, and Ki for inorganic phosphate. But the turnover number of the mutant enzyme at pH 8.0 was only one-tenth of that of the wild type enzyme. Analysis of the mechanism of catalytic action by transient kinetics showed that the amino acid substitution causes a specific alteration in the rate of the conformation change during the turnover of the enzyme without apparently affecting any other process in the multistep pathway. The comparison of the kinetics of substrate hydrolysis by mutant and wild type enzymes permits one to distinguish between various proposals for the mechanism of alkaline phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1552610907,"Abstract The amino acid substitution caused by the inactivating point mutation, trpB244, in tryptophan synthetase β2 subunit (Escherichia coli K-12) was found to be Lys → Asn. This alteration was characterized in the tryptic, chymotryptic, and cyanogen bromide fragments containing the substitution. When the sequence of the 35-residue cyanogen bromide fragment was obtained, this proved to comprise the COOH terminus of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1513140557,"Abstract Reaction of l-asparaginase from Escherichia coli with tetranitromethane converted up to 25% of the tyrosine residues to nitrotyrosine. In addition, however, acrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated aggregation of the nitroenzyme into multiple higher molecular weight species. Up to 60% of the monomers of this tetrameric enzyme were covalently cross-linked as a result of the tetranitromethane treatment. Although extensive inactivation of asparaginase activity occurred, glutaminase activity intrinsic in the native enzyme and the hydrolysis of β-cyano-l-alanine were relatively more inactivated. The rate of covalent binding of 5-diazo-4-oxo-l-norvaline to the active site of the enzyme was increased 2-fold in the nitroenzyme. These studies suggest caution in the treatment of oligomeric enzymes with tetranitromethane since extensive cross-linkage as well as alterations of substrate specificity can occur."
https://openalex.org/W1556320551,"Abstract A two-enzyme segment of a membrane-bound series of glycosyltransferase enzymes from Salmonella typhimurium has been reconstituted in vitro from the purified components. The reassembled structure contained the two enzymes (glucosyl- and galactosyltransferases) together with phosphatidylethanolamine and lipopolysaccharide. Isolation by differential centrifugation and isopycnic centrifugation of a particle containing the four components, and the demonstration that the coupled activity of the two enzymes was restored, indicate that the enzyme proteins were properly inserted into a common phospholipid-lipopolysaccharide matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1607943800,"Abstract Lysine or Mg2+ alone at high concentrations brings about partial dimerization of the lysine-sensitive aspartokinase of Escherichia coli B. The native enzyme, which has a molecular weight of 75,300 and consists of 2 subunits, responds to a combination of lysine and Mg2+ at much lower concentrations by dimerizing to a tetrameric molecule with a molecular weight approaching 150,000. This dimerization is also observed in the presence of substrates at lysine concentrations known to be inhibitory. The substrates MgATP and aspartate also produce dimerization at high concentrations, and substrate inhibition is observed with MgATP. Aging of aspartokinase results in a loss of cooperativity for lysine inhibition with lysine saturation curves becoming hyperbolic. Aging also results in a loss of lysine-binding capacity and catalytic activity and decreases the extent of dimerization induced by lysine and Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1534890293,"Abstract An alkaline phosphatase-negative (P-) mutant of Escherichia coli K-12 that produces a protein antigenically related to the wild type enzyme has been found to accumulate a zinc-deficient dimeric form of this metalloenzyme. The mutationally altered alkaline phosphatase could be activated by incubation at pH values between 5 and 6 in the presence of Zn(II) at 37°. The kinetics of the activation process was examined with purified preparations of the apoenzyme. Activation appeared to consist of multiple stages of structural rearrangements induced by zinc binding. The pH sensitivity of the activation of the isolated protein could be correlated with a pH conditionality of the P- phenotype. Thus, the mutant acted as a P- strain when grown at pH 7.4, but was P+ when grown at pH 6.0. Although unable to grow effectively in a medium containing an organic phosphate as the sole phosphate source at pH 7.4, the P- strain survived much better than its P+ parent in a medium totally lacking phosphorus."
