https://openalex.org/W2039055473,"Prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) predicts a wide variety of behavioral and physical outcomes in the offspring. Although epigenetic processes may be responsible for PNMS effects, human research is hampered by the lack of experimental methods that parallel controlled animal studies. Disasters, however, provide natural experiments that can provide models of prenatal stress.Five months after the 1998 Quebec ice storm we recruited women who had been pregnant during the disaster and assessed their degrees of objective hardship and subjective distress. Thirteen years later, we investigated DNA methylation profiling in T cells obtained from 36 of the children, and compared selected results with those from saliva samples obtained from the same children at age 8.Prenatal maternal objective hardship was correlated with DNA methylation levels in 1675 CGs affiliated with 957 genes predominantly related to immune function; maternal subjective distress was uncorrelated. DNA methylation changes in SCG5 and LTA, both highly correlated with maternal objective stress, were comparable in T cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and saliva cells.These data provide first evidence in humans supporting the conclusion that PNMS results in a lasting, broad, and functionally organized DNA methylation signature in several tissues in offspring. By using a natural disaster model, we can infer that the epigenetic effects found in Project Ice Storm are due to objective levels of hardship experienced by the pregnant woman rather than to her level of sustained distress."

This comes about by differential gene regulation and by establishing a type of gene expression memory that is passed down during cell division to daughter cells. Gaydos et al. report that in nematodes, both sperm and oocytes transmit a memory of chromatin repression to embryos in the form of modified histones. During DNA replication, modified histones are passed to daughter chromatids to provide chromatin memory for a few cell divisions. Histone-modifying enzymes replenish histone modifications and provide long-term chromatin memory. Science , this issue p. 1515"
https://openalex.org/W2038608171,"Bile acid signaling is a critical regulator of glucose and energy metabolism, mainly through the nuclear receptor FXR and the G protein-coupled receptor TGR. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether dual activation of FXR and TGR5 plays a significant role in the prevention of atherosclerosis progression. To evaluate the effects of bile acid signaling in atherogenesis, ApoE−/− mice and LDLR−/− mice were treated with an FXR/TGR5 dual agonist (INT-767). INT-767 treatment drastically reduced serum cholesterol levels. INT-767 treatment significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in both ApoE−/− and LDLR−/− mice. INT-767 decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the aortas of ApoE−/− mice through the inactivation of NF-κB. In addition, J774 macrophages treated with INT-767 had significantly lower levels of active NF-κB, resulting in cytokine production in response to LPS through a PKA dependent mechanism. This study demonstrates that concurrent activation of FXR and TGR5 attenuates atherosclerosis by reducing both circulating lipids and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2057013721,"Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) participate in the regulation of inflammation and innate immunity, for example by responding to pathogen-derived signals and by regulating the function of innate immune cells. MSCs from the bone-marrow and peripheral tissues share common basic cell-biological functions. However, it is unknown whether these MSCs exhibit different responses to microbial challenge and whether this response subsequently modulates the regulation of inflammatory cells by MSCs. Methodology/Principal Findings We isolated MSCs from human bone-marrow (bmMSCs) and human salivary gland (pgMSCs). Expression levels of TLR4 and LPS-responsive molecules were determined by flow cytometry and quantitative PCR. Cytokine release was determined by ELISA. The effect of supernatants from unstimulated and LPS-stimulated MSCs on recruitment, cytokine secretion, bacterial clearance and oxidative burst of polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) was tested in vitro. Despite minor quantitative differences, bmMSCs and pgMSCs showed a similar cell biological response to bacterial endotoxin. Both types of MSCs augmented anti-microbial functions of PMNs LPS stimulation, particularly of bmMSCs, further augmented MSC-mediated activation of PMN. Conclusions/Significance This study suggests that MSCs may contribute to the resolution of infection and inflammation by promoting the anti-microbial activity of PMNs. This property is exerted by MSCs derived from both the bone-marrow and peripheral glandular tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2042609726,"Drp1 is a dynamin-like GTPase that mediates mitochondrial and peroxisomal division in a process dependent on self-assembly and coupled to GTP hydrolysis. Despite the link between Drp1 malfunction and human disease, the molecular details of its membrane activity remain poorly understood. Here we reconstituted and directly visualized Drp1 activity in giant unilamellar vesicles. We quantified the effect of lipid composition and GTP on membrane binding and remodeling activity by fluorescence confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. In contrast to other dynamin relatives, Drp1 bound to both curved and flat membranes even in the absence of nucleotides. We also found that Drp1 induced membrane tubulation that was stimulated by cardiolipin. Moreover, Drp1 promoted membrane tethering dependent on the intrinsic curvature of the membrane lipids and on GTP. Interestingly, Drp1 concentrated at membrane contact surfaces and, in the presence of GTP, formed discrete clusters on the vesicles. Our findings support a role of Drp1 not only in the formation of lipid tubes but also on the stabilization of tightly apposed membranes, which are intermediate states in the process of mitochondrial fission.

https://openalex.org/W2040102528,"Peripartum nutrition is crucial for developing the immune system of neonates. We hypothesized that maternal short-chain fructooligosaccharide (scFOS) supplementation could accelerate the development of intestinal immunity in offspring. Thirty-four sows received a standard or a scFOS supplemented diet (10 g scFOS/d) for the last 4 weeks of gestation and the 4 weeks of lactation. Colostrum and milk immunoglobulins (Ig) and TGFβ1 concentrations were evaluated on the day of delivery and at d 6 and d 21 postpartum. Piglet intestinal structure, the immunologic features of jejunal and ileal Peyer's patches, and mesenteric lymph node cells were analysed at postnatal d 21. Short-chain fatty acid concentrations were measured over time in the intestinal contents of suckling and weaned piglets. Colostral IgA (P<0.05) significantly increased because of scFOS and TGFβ1 concentrations tended to improve (P<0.1). IFNγ secretion by stimulated Peyer's patch and mesenteric lymph node cells, and secretory IgA production by unstimulated Peyer's patch cells were increased (P<0.05) in postnatal d 21 scFOS piglets. These differences were associated with a higher proportion of activated CD25+CD4α+ T cells among the CD4+ helper T lymphocytes (P<0.05) as assessed by flow cytometry. IFNγ secretion was positively correlated with the population of activated T lymphocytes (P<0.05). Total short-chain fatty acids were unchanged between groups during lactation but were higher in caecal contents of d 90 scFOS piglets (P<0.05); specifically propionate, butyrate and valerate. In conclusion, we demonstrated that maternal scFOS supplementation modified the intestinal immune functions in piglets in association with increased colostral immunity. Such results underline the key role of maternal nutrition in supporting the postnatal development of mucosal immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2031395737,"Bitter taste receptors and signaling molecules, which detect bitter taste in the mouth, are expressed in the gut mucosa. In this study, we tested whether two distinct bitter taste receptors, the bitter taste receptor 138 (T2R138), selectively activated by isothiocyanates, and the broadly tuned bitter taste receptor 108 (T2R108) are regulated by luminal content. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that T2R138 transcript is more abundant in the colon than the small intestine and lowest in the stomach, whereas T2R108 mRNA is more abundant in the stomach compared to the intestine. Both transcripts in the stomach were markedly reduced by fasting and restored to normal levels after 4 hours re-feeding. A cholesterol-lowering diet, mimicking a diet naturally low in cholesterol and rich in bitter substances, increased T2R138 transcript, but not T2R108, in duodenum and jejunum, and not in ileum and colon. Long-term ingestion of high-fat diet increased T2R138 RNA, but not T2R108, in the colon. Similarly, α-gustducin, a bitter taste receptor signaling molecule, was reduced by fasting in the stomach and increased by lowering cholesterol in the small intestine and by high-fat diet in the colon. These data show that both short and long term changes in the luminal contents alter expression of bitter taste receptors and associated signaling molecules in the mucosa, supporting the proposed role of bitter taste receptors in luminal chemosensing in the gastrointestinal tract. Bitter taste receptors might serve as regulatory and defensive mechanism to control gut function and food intake and protect the body from the luminal environment."
https://openalex.org/W2038250774,"Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a chronic disease characterized by widespread pain, and difficult to diagnose and treat. We analyzed the plasma metabolic profile of patients with FMS by using a metabolomics approach combining Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time Of Flight/Mass Spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS) with multivariate statistical analysis, aiming to discriminate patients and controls. LC-Q-TOF/MS analysis of plasma (FMS patients: n = 22 and controls: n = 21) identified many lipid compounds, mainly lysophosphocholines (lysoPCs), phosphocholines and ceramides. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to identify the discriminating metabolites. A protein docking and molecular dynamic (MD) study was then performed, using the most discriminating lysoPCs, to validate the binding to Platelet Activating Factor (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, PAF) Receptor (PAFr). Discriminating metabolites between FMS patients and controls were identified as 1-tetradecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [PC(14:0/0:0)] and 1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [PC(16:0/0:0)]. MD and docking indicate that the ligands investigated have similar potentialities to activate the PAFr receptor. The application of a metabolomic approach discriminated FMS patients from controls, with an over-representation of PC(14:0/0:0) and PC(16:0/0:0) compounds in the metabolic profiles. These results and the modeling of metabolite-PAFr interaction, allowed us to hypothesize that lipids oxidative fragmentation might generate lysoPCs in abundance, that in turn will act as PAF-like bioactivators. Overall results suggest disease biomarkers and potential therapeutical targets for FMS."
https://openalex.org/W2060842903,"The Gram-positive bacterium Paenibacillus larvae is the etiological agent of American Foulbrood. This bacterial infection of honey bee brood is a notifiable epizootic posing a serious threat to global honey bee health because not only individual larvae but also entire colonies succumb to the disease. In the recent past considerable progress has been made in elucidating molecular aspects of host pathogen interactions during pathogenesis of P. larvae infections. Especially the sequencing and annotation of the complete genome of P. larvae was a major step forward and revealed the existence of several giant gene clusters coding for non-ribosomal peptide synthetases which might act as putative virulence factors. We here present the detailed analysis of one of these clusters which we demonstrated to be responsible for the biosynthesis of bacillibactin, a P. larvae siderophore. We first established culture conditions allowing the growth of P. larvae under iron-limited conditions and triggering siderophore production by P. larvae. Using a gene disruption strategy we linked siderophore production to the expression of an uninterrupted bacillibactin gene cluster. In silico analysis predicted the structure of a trimeric trithreonyl lactone (DHB-Gly-Thr)3 similar to the structure of bacillibactin produced by several Bacillus species. Mass spectrometric analysis unambiguously confirmed that the siderophore produced by P. larvae is identical to bacillibactin. Exposure bioassays demonstrated that P. larvae bacillibactin is not required for full virulence of P. larvae in laboratory exposure bioassays. This observation is consistent with results obtained for bacillibactin in other pathogenic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2087402433,"Acne vulgaris is a very common disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the human skin. The pathological processes of acne are not fully understood. To gain further insight sebaceous follicular casts were extracted from 18 healthy and 20 acne-affected individuals by cyanoacrylate-gel biopsies and further processed for mass spectrometry analysis, aiming at a proteomic analysis of the sebaceous follicular casts. Human as well as bacterial proteins were identified. Human proteins enriched in acne and normal samples were detected, respectively. Normal follicular casts are enriched in proteins such as prohibitins and peroxiredoxins which are involved in the protection from various stresses, including reactive oxygen species. By contrast, follicular casts extracted from acne-affected skin contained proteins involved in inflammation, wound healing and tissue remodeling. Among the most distinguishing proteins were myeloperoxidase, lactotransferrin, neutrophil elastase inhibitor and surprisingly, vimentin. The most significant biological process among all acne-enriched proteins was ‘response to a bacterium’. Identified bacterial proteins were exclusively from Propionibacterium acnes. The most abundant P. acnes proteins were surface-exposed dermatan sulphate adhesins, CAMP factors, and a so far uncharacterized lipase in follicular casts extracted from normal as well as acne-affected skin. This is a first proteomic study that identified human proteins together with proteins of the skin microbiota in sebaceous follicular casts."
https://openalex.org/W2017571136,"miRNAs are key regulatory small non-coding RNAs involved in critical steps of melanoma tumorigenesis; however, the relationship between sequence specific variations at the 5' or 3' termini (isomiR) of a miRNA and cancer phenotype remains unclear. Deep-sequencing and qRT-PCR showed reduced expression of miR-144/451a cluster and most abundant isomiR (miR451a.1) in dysplastic nevi, in-situ and invasive melanomas compared to common nevi and normal skin (n = 101). miRNA in situ hybridization reproducibly confirmed lost miR-451a.1 in melanoma compared to nevus cells or adjacent keratinocytes. Significantly higher expression of miR-451a.1 was associated with amelanotic phenotype in melanomas (n = 47). In contrast, miR-451a was associated with melanotic phenotype, absent pagetoid scatter of intraepidermal melanocytes, superficial spreading histological subtype and tumor inflammation. Sequencing miRNAs from cultured melanocytes with cytoplasmic melanin gradient (light, medium to dark) showed absent miR-451a while revealing other melanin-associated miRNAs, e.g. miR-30b, miR-100 and miR-590 in darkly and let-7a, let-7i and let-7f in lightly to moderately pigmented cultured melanocytes. Ectopic expression of miR-144/451a in melanoma cell lines resulted in markedly higher levels of mature miR-451a.1 than miR451a or miR-144; and significantly retarded cell migration and inhibited invasion in a glucose-sensitive manner. Surprisingly, these effects were not mediated by calcium binding protein 39 (CAB39), a proven miR451a gene target. miR-144/miR-451a cluster is a novel miRNA locus with tumor suppressive activity in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2032383097,"Recent findings indicate that apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) may be a protective humoral mediator involved in remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC). This study sought to determine if ApoA-I mediates its protective effects via the RISK and SAFE signaling pathways implicated in RIPC. Wistar rats were allocated to one of the following groups. Control: rats were subjected to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) without any further intervention; RIPC: four cycles of limb I/R were applied prior to myocardial ischemia; ApoA-I: 10 mg/Kg of ApoA-I were intravenously injected prior to myocardial ischemia; ApoA-I + inhibitor: pharmacological inhibitors of RISK/SAFE pro-survival kinase (Akt, ERK1/2 and STAT-3) were administered prior to ApoA-I injection. Infarct size was significantly reduced in the RIPC group compared to Control. Similarly, ApoA-I injection efficiently protected the heart, recapitulating RIPC-induced cardioprotection. The ApoA-I protective effect was associated with Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation and substantially inhibited by pretreatment with Akt and ERK1/2 inhibitors. Pretreatment with ApoA-I in a rat model of I/R recapitulates RIPC-induced cardioprotection and shares some similar molecular mechanisms with those of RIPC-involved protection of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1977642962,"BMP9, a member of the TGFβ superfamily, is a homodimer that forms a signaling complex with two type I and two type II receptors. Signaling through high-affinity activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) in endothelial cells, circulating BMP9 acts as a vascular quiescence factor, maintaining endothelial homeostasis. BMP9 is also the most potent BMP for inducing osteogenic signaling in mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and promoting bone formation in vivo. This activity requires ALK1, the lower affinity type I receptor ALK2, and higher concentrations of BMP9. In adults, BMP9 is constitutively expressed in hepatocytes and secreted into the circulation. Optimum concentrations of BMP9 are essential to maintain the highly specific endothelial-protective function. Factors regulating BMP9 stability and activity remain unknown. Here, we showed by chromatography and a 1.9 Å crystal structure that stable BMP9 dimers could form either with (D-form) or without (M-form) an intermolecular disulfide bond. Although both forms of BMP9 were capable of binding to the prodomain and ALK1, the M-form demonstrated less sustained induction of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. The two forms could be converted into each other by changing the redox potential, and this redox switch caused a major alteration in BMP9 stability. The M-form displayed greater susceptibility to redox-dependent cleavage by proteases present in serum. This study provides a mechanism for the regulation of circulating BMP9 concentrations and may provide new rationales for approaches to modify BMP9 levels for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2041553059,"Radiotherapy is the primary treatment for patients with head and neck cancer, which account for roughly 500,000 annual cases worldwide. Dysfunction of the salivary glands and associated conditions like xerostomia and dysphagia are often developed by these patients, greatly diminishing their life quality. Current preventative and palliative care fail to deliver an improvement in the quality of life, thus accentuating the need for regenerative therapies. In this study, a model of label retaining cells (LRCs) in murine salivary glands was developed, in which LRCs demonstrated proliferative potential and possessed markers of putative salivary progenitors. Mice were labeled with 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) at postnatal day 10 and chased for 8 weeks. Tissue sections from salivary glands obtained at the end of chase demonstrated co-localization between LRCs and the salivary progenitor markers keratin 5 and keratin 14, as well as kit mRNA, indicating that LRCs encompass a heterogeneous population of salivary progenitors. Proliferative potential of LRCs was demonstrated by a sphere assay, in which LRCs were found in primary and secondary spheres and they co-localized with the proliferation marker Ki67 throughout sphere formation. Surprisingly, LRCs were shown to be radio-resistant and evade apoptosis following radiation treatment. The clinical significance of these findings lie in the potential of this model to study the mechanisms that prevent salivary progenitors from maintaining homeostasis upon exposure to radiation, which will in turn facilitate the development of regenerative therapies for salivary gland dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2071025408,"Background Previous research has identified a number of variables that constitute potential risk factors for victimization and revictimization. However, it remains unclear which factors are associated not only with childhood or adolescent victimization, but specifically with revictimization. The aim of this study was to determine whether risk recognition ability and other variables previously associated with revictimization are specifically able to differentiate individuals with childhood victimization only from revictimized individuals, and thus to predict revictimization. Methods Participants were N = 85 women aged 21 to 64 years who were interpersonally victimized in childhood or adolescence only, interpersonally revictimized in another period of life, or not victimized. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine whether risk recognition ability, sensation seeking, self-efficacy, state dissociation, shame, guilt, assertiveness, and attachment anxiety predicted group membership. Results The logistic regression analysis revealed risk recognition ability, attachment anxiety, state dissociation, and self-efficacy as significant predictors of revictimization. The final model accurately classified 82.4% of revictimized, 59.1% of victimized and 93.1% of non-victimized women. The overall classification rate was 80%. Conclusions This study suggests that risk recognition ability, attachment anxiety, self-efficacy, and state dissociation play a key role in revictimization. Increased risk recognition ability after an interpersonal trauma may act as a protective factor against repeated victimization that revictimized individuals may lack. A lack of increased risk recognition ability in combination with higher attachment anxiety, lower self-efficacy, and higher state dissociation may increase the risk of revictimization."
https://openalex.org/W2169441493,"Self-rated health (SRH) is a valid measure of health status and associated with mortality. Based on individual-level biannual repeat data on SRH we sought to characterize the natural history of poor SRH during the 12 years prior to death in men and women in different age groups. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the Health and Retirement Study participants who died between 1998 and 2010 and had at least two SRH measurements in the 12 years prior to death. We used a nested case-control design to compare SRH trajectories of deceased men and women aged 30-64, 65-79 and 80 years versus surviving participants. The cases comprised 3,350 deceased participants who were matched to surviving controls (n = 8,127). SRH was dichotomized into good vs. poor health. Men and women dying at age 65-79 and ≥ 80 years had 1.5 to 3 times higher prevalence of poor SRH already 11-12 years prior to death compared to surviving controls. The risk estimates remained statistically significant even after adjusting for life-style related risk factors and diagnosed diseases. Prevalence of poor SRH before death was lowest among those aged ≥ 80 years and highest in 30-64 year-olds. In conclusion, men and women who subsequently die perceive their health worse already 11-12 years prior to death compared to their surviving controls."

Among them, the remarkable stability of hSOD1WT and several of its ALS-associated mutants suggests that hSOD1 oxidation may precede its conversion to the unfolded and aggregated forms found in ALS patients. The bicarbonate-dependent peroxidase activity of hSOD1 causes oxidation of its own solvent-exposed Trp32 residue. The resulting products are apparently different from those produced in the absence of bicarbonate and are most likely specific for simian SOD1s, which contain the Trp32 residue. The aims of this work were to examine whether the bicarbonate-dependent peroxidase activity of hSOD1 (hSOD1WT and hSOD1G93A mutant) triggers aggregation of the enzyme and to comprehend the role of the Trp32 residue in the process. The results showed that Trp32 residues of both enzymes are oxidized to a similar extent to hSOD1-derived tryptophanyl radicals. These radicals decayed to hSOD1-N-formylkynurenine and hSOD1-kynurenine or to a hSOD1 covalent dimer cross-linked by a ditryptophan bond, causing hSOD1 unfolding, oligomerization, and non-amyloid aggregation. The latter process was inhibited by tempol, which recombines with the hSOD1-derived tryptophanyl radical, and did not occur in the absence of bicarbonate or with enzymes that lack the Trp32 residue (bovine SOD1 and hSOD1W32F mutant).

In addition, hSOD1 is a small protein (153 amino acids and 1 copper and 1 zinc ion per monomer), which in the native state is a remarkably stable non-covalent homodimer highly resistant to detergents and proteolysis. Nevertheless, mutations in hSOD1 (>170 have been described) are associated with the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). As is the case with other neurodegenerative diseases, protein misfolding and aggregation are hallmarks of ALS. A distinctive feature of ALS is that it displays amorphous protein aggregates instead of the amyloid aggregates characteristic of most protein aggregation diseases (9Hwang Y.-M. Stathopulos P.B.

It is agreed that ALS-SOD1 mutants cause motor neuron death via a toxic gain-of-function that is independent of the normal antioxidant function of the enzyme. Over the years, many theories about the nature of this toxic gain-of-function have been proposed, such as an ability to generate oxidants, a higher sensitivity to oxidants and to denaturing conditions, and a higher propensity for aggregation (11Rosen D.R.

The latter characteristic is currently the most emphasized, although it may be related to the other properties. In fact, the so-called non-native hSOD1 forms, which are detected in the affected areas of the central nervous systems of patients and animal models of the disease and are considered crucial to ALS pathogenesis, include unfolded/misfolded hSOD1 forms (18Rakhit R.

These non-native hSOD1 forms have been characterized primarily by immuno-based techniques, which provide limited structural information. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that some of the non-native hSOD1 forms are oxidized to some extent. The possibility of oxidative modifications of hSOD1 triggering hSOD1 unfolding and aggregation was first proposed in 2002 by Chakrabartty and co-workers (25Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A.

Subsequent studies by these and other investigators have shown that hSOD1 oxidized by long incubations with hydrogen peroxide, added in bolus or generated by other agents, undergoes major structural changes and non-amyloid aggregation resembling that observed in ALS (10Mulligan V.K.

These structural modifications have been shown to occur downstream to the oxidation of His80 and His120 residues in the active site of hSOD1 (10Mulligan V.K. Kerman A. Laister R.C. Sharda P.R.

These oxidations are caused by Fenton chemistry, including that associated with the peroxidase activity of SOD1, in which the enzyme consumes modest amounts of hydrogen peroxide to become oxidized and inactivated (27Hodgson E.K.

In the presence of bicarbonate, SOD1 consumes considerable amounts of hydrogen peroxide to generate the carbonate radical before becoming inactivated. This highly oxidizing radical can diffuse away from the active site and oxidize distant targets, such as other proteins (28Bonini M.G. Fernandes D.C. Augusto O.

Apparently, the latter hSOD1 oxidation products are different from those produced in the absence of the bicarbonate buffer (10Mulligan V.K. Kerman A. Laister R.C. Sharda P.R. Arslan P.E.

The involvement of the oxidation products of hSOD1-Trp32 in triggering hSOD1 aggregation has been hypothesized (3Zhang H. Andrekopoulos C. Joseph J. Chandran K. Karoui H. Crow J.P. Kalyanaraman B.

Here, we examine whether the bicarbonate-dependent peroxidase activity of hSOD1, both hSOD1WT and the hSOD1G93A mutant, triggers its aggregation and whether the Trp32 residue plays a role in the process. Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma, Merck, or Fisher and were analytical grade or better.

Beckman from the Linus Pauling Institute. To obtain the mutant hSOD1W32F, we employed a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Biotechnology). Two pairs of reverse complementary primers harboring the appropriate single mutation were designed (forward primer: GGACCAGTGAAGGTGTTCGGAAGCATTAAAGGAC and reverse primer: GTCCTTTAATGCTTCCGAACACCTTCACTGGTCC) and purchased from Extend Inc. The PCR was performed according to the standard procedure of the site-directed mutagenesis kit. The pET3D plasmid containing the new SOD1W32F mutant gene was transformed into Escherichia coli and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing (GenBankTM number KJ179904). The plasmids were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS, and the enzymes were purified and analyzed as previously described (6Medinas D.B. Toledo Jr., J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2035254220,"Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) has been widely used in China as a drug for the treatment of various diseases. Recent studies have suggested that TMP has a protective effect on ischemic neuronal damage. However, the exact mechanism is still unclear. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of TMP mediated ischemic hippocampal neurons injury induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). The effect of TMP on hippocampal neurons viability was detected by MTT assay, LDH release assay and apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry. TMP significantly suppressed neuron apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. TMP could significantly reduce the elevated levels of connexin32 (Cx32) induced by OGD. Knockdown of Cx32 by siRNA attenuated OGD injury. Moreover, our study showed that viability was increased in siRNA-Cx32-treated-neurons, and neuron apoptosis was suppressed by activating Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting Bax expression. Over expression of Cx32 could decrease neurons viability and increase LDH release. Furthermore, OGD increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38, whose inhibitors relieved the neuron injury and Cx32 up-regulation. Taken together, TMP can reverse the OGD-induced Cx32 expression and cell apoptosis via the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2011804090,"Integrin-mediated cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion is critical for control of intracellular signaling; however, the mechanisms underlying this ""outside-in"" signaling are incompletely understood. Here we show that depletion of kindlin-2 impairs integrin outside-in signaling. Kindlin-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon cell-ECM adhesion. Furthermore, kindlin-2 binds Src in a cell-ECM adhesion-regulatable fashion. At the molecular level, the kindlin-2·Src interaction is mediated by the kindlin-2 F0 and the Src SH2 and SH3 domains. Src activation increases kindlin-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and the kindlin-2·Src interaction. Conversely, inhibition of Src reduces kindlin-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and diminishes the kindlin-2·Src interaction. Finally, disruption of the kindlin-2·Src interaction, unlike depletion of kindlin-2, impairs neither cell-ECM adhesion nor cell-ECM adhesion-induced focal adhesion kinase Tyr-397 phosphorylation. However, it markedly inhibits cell-ECM adhesion-induced paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation, cell migration, and proliferation. These results suggest that kindlin-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and interaction with Src serve as a regulatable switch downstream of focal adhesion kinase in the integrin outside-in signaling circuit, relaying signals from cell-ECM adhesion to paxillin that control cell migration and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2055132501,"Thrombocytopenia is a serious issue connected with the pathogenesis of several human diseases including chronic inflammation, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and other oxidative stress-associated pathologies. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics and other biological drugs are reported to result in thrombocytopenia, which is often neglected during the treatment regime. In addition, augmented oxidative stress induced by drugs and pathological conditions has also been shown to induce thrombocytopenia, which seems to be the most obvious consequence of elevated rate of platelet apoptosis. Thus, blocking oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis would be of prime importance in order to negotiate thrombocytopenia and associated human pathologies. The current study presents the synthesis and platelet protective nature of novel ibuprofen derivatives. The potent anti-oxidant ibuprofen derivative 4f was selected for the study and the platelet protective efficacy and platelet aggregation inhibitory property has been demonstrated. The compound 4f dose dependently mitigates the oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis in both platelet rich plasma and washed platelets. The platelet protective nature of compound 4f was determined by assessing various apoptotic markers such as ROS generation, cytosolic Ca2+ levels, PS externalization, cytochrome C translocation, Caspase activation, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytotoxicity, LDH leakage and tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic proteins. Furthermore, compound 4f dose dependently ameliorated agonist induced platelet aggregation. Therefore, compound 4f can be estimated as a potential candidate in the treatment regime of pathological disorders associated with platelet activation and apoptosis. In addition, compound 4f can be used as an auxiliary therapeutic agent in pathologies associated with thrombocytopenia."
https://openalex.org/W2080113882,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA or kallikrein-related peptidase-3, KLK3) exerts chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activity. The main biological function of PSA is the liquefaction of the clot formed after ejaculation by cleavage of semenogelins I and II in seminal fluid. PSA also cleaves several other substrates, which may explain its putative functions in prostate cancer and its antiangiogenic activity. We compared the proteolytic efficiency of PSA towards several protein and peptide substrates and studied the effect of peptides stimulating the activity of PSA with these substrates. An endothelial cell tube formation model was used to analyze the effect of PSA-degraded protein fragments on angiogenesis. We showed that PSA degrades semenogelins I and II much more efficiently than other previously identified protein substrates, e.g., fibronectin, galectin-3 and IGFBP-3. We identified nidogen-1 as a new substrate for PSA. Peptides B2 and C4 that stimulate the activity of PSA towards small peptide substrates also enhanced the proteolytic activity of PSA towards protein substrates. Nidogen-1, galectin-3 or their fragments produced by PSA did not have any effect on endothelial cell tube formation. Although PSA cleaves several other protein substrates, in addition to semenogelins, the physiological importance of this activity remains speculative. The PSA levels in prostate are very high, but several other highly active proteases, such as hK2 and trypsin, are also expressed in the prostate and may cleave protein substrates that are weakly cleaved by PSA."
https://openalex.org/W2083426991,"Children below six months are reported to be less susceptible to clinical malaria. Maternally derived antibodies and foetal haemoglobin are important putative protective factors. We examined antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) and glutamate-rich protein (GLURP), in children in their first two years of life in Burkina Faso and their risk of malaria.A cohort of 140 infants aged between four and six weeks was recruited in a stable transmission area of south-western Burkina Faso and monitored for 24 months by active and passive surveillance. Malaria infections were detected by examining blood smears using light microscopy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify total Immunoglobulin G to Plasmodium falciparum antigens MSP3 and two regions of GLURP (R0 and R2) on blood samples collected at baseline, three, six, nine, 12, 18 and 24 months. Foetal haemoglobin and variant haemoglobin fractions were measured at the baseline visit using high pressure liquid chromatography.A total of 79.6% of children experienced one or more episodes of febrile malaria during monitoring. Antibody titres to MSP3 were prospectively associated with an increased risk of malaria while antibody responses to GLURP (R0 and R2) did not alter the risk. Antibody titres to MSP3 were higher among children in areas of high malaria risk. Foetal haemoglobin was associated with delayed first episode of febrile malaria and haemoglobin CC type was associated with reduced incidence of febrile malaria.We did not find any evidence of association between titres of antibodies to MSP3, GLURP-R0 or GLURP-R2 as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and early protection against malaria, although anti-MSP3 antibody titres may reflect increased exposure to malaria and therefore greater risk. Foetal haemoglobin was associated with protection against febrile malaria despite the study limitations and its role is therefore worthy further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1963970776,"Enteral formula feeding is a risk factor for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants, yet studies are conflicting regarding the safest timing for introduction and advancement of feeds. Our aim was to test the effects of early vs. late initiation and abrupt vs. gradual advancement of enteral feeding of an intact vs. hydrolyzed protein formula on NEC incidence and severity in preterm pigs. In Experiment 1, preterm pigs received total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at birth with abrupt initiation of enteral formula feeds (50% full intake) on d of life (DOL) 2 (EA) or 5 (LA) while PN continued. Pigs were also fed formula containing either intact or hydrolyzed protein. In Experiment 2, preterm pigs received TPN at birth with enteral, hydrolyzed-protein formula feeds introduced on DOL 2 either abruptly (EA; 50% full feeds) or gradually (EG; 10-50% full feeds over 5 d) while PN continued. NEC incidence and severity were assessed based on macroscopic and histological scoring. In Experiment 1, NEC incidence (41% vs. 70%, P<0.05) and severity were reduced in LA vs. EA groups and LA was associated with a higher survival rate, daily weight gain and jejunum villus height. Piglets fed hydrolyzed vs. intact protein formula had lower stomach content weights and similar NEC incidence. In Experiment 2, NEC incidence and severity were not different between pigs the EG vs. EA group. Proinflammatory gene expression (IL-1β, IL-6 and S100A9) in the ileum was lower in both LA and EG vs. EA groups. In conclusion, delayed initiation but not gradual advancement of enteral feeding is protective against NEC in preterm pigs. Feeding hydrolyzed vs. intact protein formula improved gastric transit without affecting the NEC incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2009669656,"Background Modafinil is employed for the treatment of narcolepsy and has also been, off-label, used to treat cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders. In a previous study, we have reported that single dose administration of modafinil in healthy young subjects enhances fluid reasoning and affects resting state activity in the Fronto Parietal Control (FPC) and Dorsal Attention (DAN) networks. No changes were found in the Salience Network (SN), a surprising result as the network is involved in the modulation of emotional and fluid reasoning. The insula is crucial hub of the SN and functionally divided in anterior and posterior subregions. Methodology Using a seed-based approach, we have now analyzed effects of modafinil on the functional connectivity (FC) of insular subregions. Principal Findings Analysis of FC with resting state fMRI (rs-FMRI) revealed increased FC between the right posterior insula and the putamen, the superior frontal gyrus and the anterior cingulate cortex in the modafinil-treated group. Conclusions Modafinil is considered a putative cognitive enhancer. The rs-fMRI modifications that we have found are consistent with the drug cognitive enhancing properties and indicate subregional targets of action. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01684306"
https://openalex.org/W2040583051,"Hypoxia/Reoxygenation (H/R) cardiac injury is of great importance in understanding Myocardial Infarctions, which affect a major part of the working population causing debilitating side effects and often-premature mortality. H/R injury primarily consists of apoptotic and necrotic death of cardiomyocytes due to a compromise in the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane. Major factors associated in the deregulation of the membrane include fluctuating reactive oxygen species (ROS), deregulation of mitochondrial permeability transport pore (MPTP), uncontrolled calcium (Ca2+) fluxes, and abnormal caspase-3 activity. Erythropoietin (EPO) is strongly inferred to be cardioprotective and acts by inhibiting the above-mentioned processes. Surprisingly, the underlying mechanism of EPO's action and H/R injury is yet to be fully investigated and elucidated. This study examined whether EPO maintains Ca2+ homeostasis and the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in cardiomyocytes when subjected to H/R injury and further explored the underlying mechanisms involved. H9C2 cells were exposed to different concentrations of EPO post-H/R, and 20 U/ml EPO was found to significantly increase cell viability by inhibiting the intracellular production of ROS and caspase-3 activity. The protective effect of EPO was abolished when H/R-induced H9C2 cells were treated with Wortmannin, an inhibitor of Akt, suggesting the mechanism of action through the activation Akt, a major survival pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1997828760,"Recent work on the use of mRNA lipoplexes for gene delivery demonstrates the need for a mathematical model that simulates and predicts kinetics and transfection efficiency. The small copy numbers involved make it necessary to use stochastic models and include statistical analysis of the variation observed in the experimental data. The modeling requirements are further complicated by the multi-level nature of the problem, where mRNA molecules are contained in lipoplexes, which are in turn contained in endosomes, where each of these entities displays a behavior of its own. We have created a mathematical model that reproduces both the time courses and the statistical variance observed in recent experiments using single-cell tracking of GFP expression after transfection. By applying a few key simplifications and assumptions, we have limited the number of free parameters to five, which we optimize to match five experimental determinants by means of a simulated annealing algorithm. The models demonstrate the need for modeling of nested species in order to reproduce the shape of the dose-response and expression-level curves."

https://openalex.org/W2064579667,"Brain activity is energetically costly and requires a steady and highly regulated flow of energy equivalents between neural cells. It is believed that a substantial share of cerebral glucose, the major source of energy of the brain, will preferentially be metabolized in astrocytes via aerobic glycolysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether uncoupling proteins (UCPs), located in the inner membrane of mitochondria, play a role in setting up the metabolic response pattern of astrocytes. UCPs are believed to mediate the transmembrane transfer of protons, resulting in the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production. UCPs are therefore potentially important regulators of energy fluxes. The main UCP isoforms expressed in the brain are UCP2, UCP4, and UCP5. We examined in particular the role of UCP4 in neuron-astrocyte metabolic coupling and measured a range of functional metabolic parameters including mitochondrial electrical potential and pH, reactive oxygen species production, NAD/NADH ratio, ATP/ADP ratio, CO2 and lactate production, and oxygen consumption rate. In brief, we found that UCP4 regulates the intramitochondrial pH of astrocytes, which acidifies as a consequence of glutamate uptake, with the main consequence of reducing efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production. The diminished ATP production is effectively compensated by enhancement of glycolysis. This nonoxidative production of energy is not associated with deleterious H2O2 production. We show that astrocytes expressing more UCP4 produced more lactate, which is used as an energy source by neurons, and had the ability to enhance neuronal survival.

In summary, only limited information is currently available regarding the role of UCPs in the brain, with the main observations with a cellular resolution being limited to neurons. In this study, we have investigated the roles of UCP4 and UCP5 in astrocytes, a cell type central to brain energy metabolism. We have previously shown (20.Azarias G. Perreten H. Lengacher S. Poburko D. Demaurex N. Magistretti P.J. Chatton J.Y. Glutamate transport decreases mitochondrial pH and modulates oxidative metabolism in astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 3550-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that uptake into astrocytes of neuronally released glutamate results in an intramitochondrial pH decrease in astrocytes rapidly reducing the effectiveness of the oxidative phosphorylation. In the present report, we show that this effect of glutamate involves UCP4. Indeed, we observed that the decrease in oxidative efficiency following glutamate uptake into astrocytes is controlled by UCP4, which reduces mitochondrial respiration by lowering the intramitochondrial pH. Reducing mitochondrial efficiency promotes aerobic glycolysis in astrocytes. Lactate produced through glycolysis can be used by neurons as an energy substrate consistent with the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (21.Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. Glutamate uptake into astrocytes stimulates aerobic glycolysis: a mechanism coupling neuronal activity to glucose utilization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10625-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). These results indicate that UCP4 plays a key role in astrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling (12.Bélanger M. Allaman I. Magistretti P.J. Brain energy metabolism: focus on astrocyte-neuron metabolic cooperation.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 724-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of cortical astrocytes were prepared from newborns (1–2 days old) Swiss Albino mice (OF1; Charles River Laboratories) as previously described (22.Sorg O. Magistretti P.J. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and noradrenaline exert long-term control on glycogen levels in astrocytes: blockade by protein synthesis inhibition.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4923-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were seeded at a density of ∼105 cells/cm2. Depending on the experiments, the cells were seeded on 35-mm Petri dishes or multiwell plates of 6, 12, 24, or 48 wells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were rinsed 3–5 days after seeding, and the medium was changed twice a week until cells reached confluency at 21 days in vitro. Experiments were performed on confluent cells. Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic day 17 OF1 mice embryos (Charles River Laboratories). Pregnant mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The abdomen was opened, and the placenta containing the embryos was removed and put in a Petri dish. The embryos were rapidly recovered, and the cut heads were placed in Petri dish containing 25 ml of ice-cold Hanks' buffered salt solution supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. The embryo brains were separated from the skulls, and olfactory bulbs, striata, hippocampi, and meninges were removed. The isolated cortices were minced in 2-mm2 pieces and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a solution containing papain 20 units/ml (Worthington Biochemical), 1 mm l-cysteine, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 100 units/ml DNase (Worthington Biochemical). Papain activity was then inhibited by addition of FCS. Any traces of papain were removed by keeping the cells sedimenting and removing the supernatant. Cell pellet was resuspended in Neurobasal medium (21103049; Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin, B27 (17504044; Invitrogen), and GlutaMAX (35050038; Invitrogen), and single-cell suspension was obtained by repeated mechanical trituration. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was carefully resuspended in prewarmed 5 ml supplemented Neurobasal medium. Cells were plated at an average density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2 on 20-mm diameter glass coverslips previously coated overnight with 25 mg/liter polyornithine and rinsed three times with sterile water the day of dissection. Neurons were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air and were used at day in vitro 14. At 21 days, when astrocytes were confluent, medium was exchanged for Neurobasal medium supplemented with GlutaMAX and B27 without antioxidant (B27 minus AO) (10889038; Invitrogen). 24 h later, the co-culture was initiated by transferring 12-day-old neurons grown on coverslips on top of the astrocyte layer culture. The coverslips with neurons were placed in such a way that neurons were facing astrocytes separated by a 3-mm gap created by three paraffin beads attached to the coverslip. The small gap created by the three paraffin beads was sufficient to avoid any contact between the two cell types, and thus to avoid astrocytic contamination of the neuronal culture, but allowed the exchange of medium. Viability experiments were performed 48 h later. RNA extraction was performed with the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen as indicated in the manufacturer's instruction. RT reactions were done with the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Life Technologies) as indicated in the manufacturer's instructions. Each reaction was done in 20 µl with 400 ng of RNA. Quantitative determination of mRNA of the five uncoupling protein isoforms were performed with the fast real time PCR system 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The following primers were used: mUCP1Fo519, 5′-CGA CTC AGT CCA AGA GTA CTT CTC TTC; mUCP1Re591, 5′-TCC CCT GTT GAT GTG GTC AA; mUCP2Fo992, 5′-TCC CCT GTT GAT GTG GTC AA; mUCP2Re1062, 5′-CAG TGA CCT GCG CTG TGG TA; mUCP3Fo78, 5′-CCT ACG ACA TCA TCA AGG AGA AGT T; mUCP3Re863, 5′-TCC AAA GGC AGA GAC AAA GTG A; mUCP4Fo13, 5′-GAA TGC CTA TCG CCG AGG A; mUCP4Re85, 5′-AGT AGG AAC TTG CTC GTC CGG; mUCP5Fo602, 5′-TCC CAA CTG CTC AGC GTG; mUCP5Re673, 5′-GGT GCT TCT TGG TAA TA TCA TAA ACG; mActinβFo31, 5′-GCT TCT TTG CAG CTC CTT CGT; mActinβRe94, 5′-ATA TCG TCA TCC ATG GCG AAC; mTBPFo271, 5′-ACC TTA TGC TCA GGG CTT GGC C; and mTBPRe359, 5′-GTC CTG TGC CGT AAG GCA TCA TTG. All primers pairs were designed to overlap exon-exon junction to avoid contamination signal from eventual genomic DNA. Genes for β-actin and TATA box binding protein were used as reference genes for the normalization. The Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) was used as a Taq polymerase master mix. All samples were analyzed in triplicate. The results were analyzed with the SDS2.3 software (Applied Biosystems). To compare the expression difference, we first convert the cycle threshold (CT) in copies number by applying the rule that CT = 10 is equivalent to 1E11 copies and CT = 37.34 is equivalent to 625 copies. We then calculate a normalization value for each sample of the reference genes by dividing each absolute value by the geomean calculated for each reference gene. We obtain a normalization factor for each gene used as calibrator (β-actin, TATA box binding protein). To obtain a calibrator number, we calculated the geomean from these reference numbers. We divided each absolute value obtained for the different samples by this final calibrator number. The result is a normalized value of gene expression for the different UCPs that keep the differences of expression between the various UCPs intact. mRNA for UCP4 and UCP5 were isolated from brain of OF1 mice. Reverse transcription was prepared by using 200 ng of extracted mRNA in 50 µl of total RT. Specific cDNA was obtained by PCR with the following primers: mUCP4FoEcoRI, 5′-GAA TTC TGC TGA ATG CCT ATC GCC; mUCP4ReSphI, 5′-GCA TGC ATG GGC TGA CTC CAC TC; mUCP5FoEcoRI, 5′-GAA TTC GTG AAT GGG TAT CTT TCC; and mUCP5ReXhoI, 5′-CTC GAG GAT CTG AAG CCT CTT GA. PCR products were cloned in the pGEMT vector (Promega), and UCPs genes were isolated by restriction digestion with EcoRI and SphI for UCP4 and with EcoRI and XhoI for UCP5 and were cloned in the pIRES-hrGFP-2a vector (Stratagene). The gene of interest is thus fused to three contiguous copies of the HA epitope (AGC GTA GTC AGG TAC ATC GTA AGG GTA AGC GTA ATC CGG AAC GTC GTA CGG ATA CGC GTA GTC TGG AAC GTC ATA TGG GTA). The next step in the lentiviral construction is the use of the Gateway System. UCP-HA genes were amplified from the pIRES-hrGFP-2a vector by PCR using the following primers: mUCP4FoTopo, 5′-CAC CAT GGG ACC TAT CGC CGA GGA GGA GAA; mUCP5FoTopo, 5′-CAC CAT GGG TAT CTT TCC CGG AAT AAT CC; and mUCPsReTopo, 5′-ATC TTG TTA AGC GTA GTC AGG TAC ATC GTA AG. PCRs were performed with a proof reading polymerase (Pfu polymerase), and the blunt end PCR products were directly cloned in the pENTR/d-TOPO using the pENTR/d-TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Transfer into the lentiviral vector SIN-PGK-CassRFA-WHV (kindly provided by Dr. H. Hirling, Lausanne, Switzerland) was performed with the Gateway LR Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The lentiviral vectors sequences for silencing UCP4 and UCP5 were purchased from Open Biosystems (reference number for UCP4, RMM3981-97057374, reference number for UCP5, RMM3981-97057464). HEK 293T cells were transfected with 13 µg of pCMVΔ8.92, 3 µg of pRSV-ReV, 3.75 µg of pMD2G, and 13 µg of the vector SIN-PGK-WHV containing the transgene per Petri dish with the calcium phosphate method and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air. Medium was replaced 6–8 h later. Medium containing lentiviruses were collected 3 days after transfection, filtered at 0.45 µm (Stericup SCHVU01RE; Millipore), and spun at 19000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C in an ultracentrifuge using SW32Ti rotors (BD Biosciences). The supernatants were removed, and each pellet containing viruses was suspended in PBS, 0.5% BSA and frozen at −80 °C. Viral titration was determined using the HIV-1 P24 ELISA kit (Zeptometrix Corporation, Buffalo, NY) as indicated in the manufacturer's instructions. For UCP overexpression, astrocytes were infected from days 3 to 5 in vitro with a final concentration of 400 ng of p24 per 35-mm Petri dish. As a control, we infected astrocytes with a lentivirus coding for GFP. The UCP expression was similar to noninfected astrocytes (data not shown), suggesting that the infection itself had no effect on UCP gene expression. For gene silencing, astrocytes were infected at a final concentration of 100 ng of p24 per 35-mm Petri dish. The mature antisense coded by the shUCP4 virus was AAT ATT GGG TAT CCA GCC TGC. The mature antisense coded by the shUCP5 virus was ATT TCT TTG AAA CGA ACA TCG. As a control of gene silencing, we infected astrocytes with a lentivirus made with a vector containing no sequence. When astrocytes reached confluency at day 21 in vitro, 35-mm Petri dishes of infected cells were placed on ice and rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were homogenized and proteins were extracted with 200 µl/dish of lysis buffer (30 mm HEPES, 210 mm sucrose, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete 11257000; Roche). Each condition was made in duplicate, and two dishes were mixed. Protein samples were sonicated and frozen at −80 °C. 10 µl of each samples were mixed to 10 µl of 2× loading buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mm DTT, 4% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) and heated at 100 °C for 4 min before loading onto an Invitrogen NuPage 10% gel (NP0301BOX). When proteins were loaded after mitochondrial isolation following the mitochondria isolation kit (MITOISO1; Sigma-Aldrich) protocol, 2.5 µg of protein were loaded. Gel was run at 100 volts at 4 °C. After running, proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose membranes (84261514; Whatman) in a Tris-glycine transfer buffer (0.4 m glycine, 0.25 m Tris-base, pH 6.8, 20% methanol). Transfers were done by application of 75 volts for 80 min at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated for 1 h in the Odyssey blocking buffer (927-40000; LI-COR) at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies polyclonal anti-HA (1:4000) (AB9110; Abcam), monoclonal anti-β actin (1:5000) (A5441; Sigma-Aldrich), or monoclonal anti-cytochrome c oxidase (1:1000) (MS407; Mitosciences) diluted in the same blocking buffer. After several washes in PBS, secondary antibodies anti-mouse IgG IRDye 800 (1:5000) (610-132-121; Bioconcept) and anti-rabbit IgG Alexafluor 680 (1:5000) (Juro, Lucerne, Switzerland) were applied for 2 h at room temperature and protected from light. After washing, membranes were scanned with the ODYSSEY Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Astrocytes grown on 20-mm coverslips and infected with UCP lentiviral constructs were carefully rinsed with PBS before being fixed in cold paraformaldehyde 4% for 15 min at room temperature. Treatment with PBS, 0.1% Triton for 15 min was performed to permeabilize the cell membranes. After three PBS washes, fixed cells were then treated with casein (0.5% in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific sites. Fixed cultures were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of the primary antibodies polyclonal anti-HA (1:500) (AB9110; Abcam), polyclonal GFAP (1:500) (Z0334; Dako), or monoclonal anti-cytochrome c oxidase (1:500) (MS407; Mitosciences). After three repeated washes in PBS, cells were incubated in the secondary antibodies goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:200) (A11008; Invitrogen) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 594 (1:200) (A11005; Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. After rinsing, coverslips were mounted in a solution containing 50% glycerol and DABCO (D2522; Sigma-Aldrich) to reduce photobleaching. Z-stack acquisitions were done using a confocal microscope ZEISS LSM 710. The images underwent deconvolution using Huygens Remote Manager v1.2.2 and were then analyzed using the Imaris Software (Bitplane Corp.). Co-localization between UCP and mitochondria was calculated with the Manders' coefficient which is the part of the intensity in each channel that coincides with a number of intensity in the other channel (with 0 indicating no co-localization and 1 indicating perfect co-localization). Glucose uptake was measured as previously described (23.Allaman I. Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. Glucocorticoids modulate neurotransmitter-induced glycogen metabolism in cultured cortical astrocytes.J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 900-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The effect of glutamate on astrocytic glucose uptake was measured in parallel in other Petri dishes by adding glutamate 200 µm in the medium containing [3H]2-deoxyglucose for 20 min of incubation. Other Petri dishes were used to measure the portion of glucose uptake that is not linked to glucose transporter by addition of the glucose transporter inhibitor cytochalasin B (C6762; Sigma-Aldrich) 25 µm during 20 min of incubation. The fraction of glucose transported is calculated by subtracting the fraction of glucose uptake that is not inhibited by the cytochalasin B. Glucose uptake was normalized to the protein content. Glycogen content was measured enzymatically as previously described (22.Sorg O. Magistretti P.J. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and noradrenaline exert long-term control on glycogen levels in astrocytes: blockade by protein synthesis inhibition.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4923-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, astrocytes grown on 35-mm Petri dishes and previously infected with UCP lentiviral constructs were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed by sonication in HCl 30 mm. Two aliquots of 100 µl were sampled. 300 µl of 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.65, was added to the first aliquot, whereas the same buffer containing 1% amyloglucosidase (10 mg/ml) was added to the other one. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, 2 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.1, containing 3.3 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm ATP, 38 µm NADP, 4 µg/ml hexokinase, and 2 µg/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence associated with the formation of NADPH was read on a fluorometer using excitation wavelength at 340 nm and emission wavelength at 450 nm. Glycogen was normalized to protein content and was expressed as glycosyl units originating from glycogen. The results are expressed as percentages of control values. Astrocytes grown on a multiplate of 48 wells and previously infected with UCP lentiviral constructs were rinsed carefully and incubated 1 h in phenol red-free DMEM (D5030; Sigma) supplemented with 2 mm glucose and 44 mm NaHCO3. After rinsing, cells were incubated in the same medium containing 5 µg/ml JC-1 dye (T-3168; Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% air and protected from light. The JC-1 dye exhibits potential dependent accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green to red (24.Smiley S.T. Reers M. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Lin M. Chen A.

At low potential, monomers are formed that display green fluorescence, whereas at higher potential, JC-1 aggregates and exhibits a red fluorescence. Cells were carefully rinsed with PBS to remove any extracellular dye, and fluorescence was directly detected on the multiplate using a fluorometer (Safir 2; Tecan). The wavelengths used are emission 497/excitation 594 for the red fluorescence"
https://openalex.org/W2000738243,"Francisella tularensis, the etiologic agent of tularemia and a Class A Select Agent, is divided into three subspecies and multiple subpopulations that differ in virulence and geographic distribution. Given these differences, there is a need to rapidly and accurately determine if a strain is F. tularensis and, if it is, assign it to subspecies and subpopulation. We designed TaqMan real-time PCR genotyping assays using eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were potentially specific to closely related groups within the genus Francisella, including numerous subpopulations within F. tularensis species. We performed extensive validation studies to test the specificity of these SNPs to particular populations by screening the assays across a set of 565 genetically and geographically diverse F. tularensis isolates and an additional 21 genetic near-neighbor (outgroup) isolates. All eleven assays correctly determined the genetic groups of all 565 F. tularensis isolates. One assay differentiates F. tularensis, F. novicida, and F. hispaniensis from the more genetically distant F. philomiragia and Francisella-like endosymbionts. Another assay differentiates F. tularensis isolates from near neighbors. The remaining nine assays classify F. tularensis-confirmed isolates into F. tularensis subspecies and subpopulations. The genotyping accuracy of these nine assays diminished when tested on outgroup isolates (i.e. non F. tularensis), therefore a hierarchical approach of assay usage is recommended wherein the F. tularensis-specific assay is used before the nine downstream assays. Among F. tularensis isolates, all eleven assays were highly sensitive, consistently amplifying very low concentrations of DNA. Altogether, these eleven TaqMan real-time PCR assays represent a highly accurate, rapid, and sensitive means of identifying the species, subspecies, and subpopulation of any F. tularensis isolate if used in a step-wise hierarchical scheme. These assays would be very useful in clinical, epidemiological, and/or forensic investigations involving F. tularensis."
https://openalex.org/W2078760984,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious problem in China. While there have been some studies on the nationwide genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), there has been little detailed research in Beijing, the capital of China, which has a huge population. Here, M. tuberculosis clinical strains collected in Beijing during 2009 were genotyped by classical methods. Methodology/Principal Findings Our aim was to analyze the genetic diversity of M. tuberculosis strains within the Beijing metropolitan area. We characterized these strains using two standard methods, spoligotyping (n = 1585) and variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) typing (n = 1053). We found that the most prominent genotype was Beijing family genotype. Other genotypes included the MANU, T and H families etc. Spoligotyping resulted in 137 type patterns, included 101 unclustered strains and 1484 strains clustered into 36 clusters. In VNTR typing analysis, we selected 12-locus (QUB-11b, MIRU10, Mtub21, MIRU 23, MIRU39, MIRU16, MIRU40, MIRU31, Mtub24, Mtub04, MIRU20, and QUB-4156c) and named it 12-locus (BJ) VNTR. VNTR resulted in 869 type patterns, included 796 unclustered strains and 257 strains clustered into 73 clusters. It has almost equal discriminatory power to the 24-locus VNTR. Conclusions/Significance Our study provides a detailed characterization of the genotypic diversity of M. tuberculosis in Beijing. Combining spoligotyping and VNTR typing to study the genotyping of M. tuberculosis gave superior results than when these techniques were used separately. Our results indicated that Beijing family strains were still the most prevalent M. tuberculosis in Beijing. Moreover, VNTR typing analyzing of M. tuberculosis strains in Beijing was successfully accomplished using 12-locus (BJ) VNTR. This method used for strains genotyping from the Beijing metropolitan area was comparable. This study will not only provide TB researchers with valuable information for related studies, but also provides guidance for the prevention and control of TB in Beijing."
https://openalex.org/W2314000248,"IscR, an Fe–S cluster-containing transcriptional factor, regulates genes involved in various cellular processes. In response to environmental stimuli such as oxidative stress and iron levels, IscR switches between its holo and apo forms to regulate various targets. IscR binding sequences are classified into two types: the type 1 IscR box that is specific for holo-IscR binding, and the type 2 IscR box that binds holo- and apo-IscR. Studying Klebsiella pneumoniae CG43S3, we have previously shown that iron availability regulates capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis and iron-acquisition systems. The present study investigated whether IscR is involved in this regulation. Compared with that in CG43S3, the amount of CPS was decreased in AP001 (ΔiscR) or AP002 (iscR3CA), a CG43S3-derived strain expressing mutated IscR mimicked apo-IscR, suggesting that only holo-IscR activates CPS biosynthesis. Furthermore, a promoter-reporter assay verified that the transcription of cps genes was reduced in AP001 and AP002. Purified IscR::His6, but not IscR3CA::His6, was also found to bind the predicted type 1 IscR box specifically in the cps promoter. Furthermore, reduced siderophore production was observed in AP004 (Δfur-ΔiscR) but not in AP005 (Δfur-iscR3CA), implying that apo-IscR activates iron acquisition. Compared with those in AP004, mRNA levels of three putative iron acquisition systems (fhu, iuc, and sit) were increased in AP005, and both purified IscR::His6 and IscR3CA::His6 bound the predicted type 2 IscR box in the fhuA, iucA, and sitA promoters, whereas IscR3CA::His6 displayed a lower affinity. Finally, we analyzed the effect of external iron levels on iscR expression. The transcription of iscR was increased under iron-depleted conditions as well as in AP001 and AP002, suggesting an auto-repression exerted by apo-IscR. Our results show that in K. pneumoniae, IscR plays a dual role in the regulation of CPS biosynthesis and iron-acquisition systems in response to environmental iron availability."

However, this does not always appear unanimously because of large inter-individual variability. This may be explained by different alleles of the functional COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism that are associated with COMT enzyme activity; high-activity enzyme, COMT(H)(Val/Val genotype), and low-activity COMT(L)(Met/Met genotype).Fourteen Caucasian subjects (BMI: 22.2±2.3 kg/m2, age: 21.4±2.2 years) of whom 7 with the COMT(H)-genotype and 7 with the COMT(L)-genotype were included in a randomized, cross-over study in which EE and substrate oxidation were measured with a ventilated-hood system after decaffeinated GT and placebo(PL) consumption.At baseline, EE, RQ, FATox and carbohydrate oxidation(CHOox) did not differ between groups. Significant interactions were observed between COMT genotypes and treatment for RQ, FATox and CHOox (p<0.05). After GT vs. PL, EE(GT: 62.2 vs. PL: 35.4 kJ.3.5 hrs; p<0.01), RQ(GT: 0.80 vs. PL: 0.83; p<0.01), FATox(GT: 18.3 vs. PL: 15.3 g/d; p<0.001) and CHOox(GT: 18.5 vs. PL: 24.3 g/d; p<0.001) were significantly different for subjects carrying the COMT(H) genotype, but not for subjects carrying the COMT(L) genotype (EE, GT: 60.3 vs. PL: 51.7 kJ.3.5 hrs; NS), (RQ, GT: 0.81 vs. PL: 0.81; NS), (FATox, GT: 17.3 vs. PL: 17.0 g/d; NS), (CHOox, GT: 22.1 vs. PL: 21.4 g/d; NS).Subjects carrying the COMT(H) genotype increased energy expenditure and fat-oxidation upon ingestion of green tea catechins vs, placebo, whereas COMT(L) genotype carriers reacted similarly to GT and PL ingestion. The differences in responses were due to the different responses on PL ingestion, but similar responses to GT ingestion, pointing to different mechanisms. The different alleles of the functional COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism appear to play a role in the inter-individual variability for EE and FATox after GT treatment.Nederlands Trial register NTR1918."

However, the potential of these cells as a target for the treatment of various immune diseases, as well as the factors involved in their development and function, remain debated. Here, we demonstrate in a myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific murine model of CNS autoimmune disease that adoptive transfer of antigen-specific iTreg cells ameliorates disease progression. Moreover, we show that the co-stimulatory molecule CTLA-4 mediates in vitro differentiation of iTreg cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the secreted, immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 controls the ability of antigen-specific iTreg cells to suppress autoimmune disease. Overall, we conclude that antigen-specific iTreg cells, which depend on various immune regulatory molecules for their differentiation and function, represent a major target for effective immunotherapy of autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2034102172,"Patients with Marfan syndrome have an increased risk of life-threatening aortic complications, mostly preceded by aortic dilatation. In the FBN1(C1039G/+) Marfan mouse model, losartan decreases aortic root dilatation. We recently confirmed this beneficial effect of losartan in adult patients with Marfan syndrome. The straightforward translation of this mouse model to man is reassuring to test novel treatment strategies. A number of studies have shown signs of inflammation in aortic tissue of Marfan patients. This study examined the efficacy of anti-inflammatory therapies in attenuating aortic root dilation in Marfan syndrome and compared effects to the main preventative agent, losartan.To inhibit inflammation in FBN1(C1039G/+) Marfan mice, we treated the mice with losartan (angiotensin II receptor type 1 inhibitor), methylprednisolone (corticosteroid) or abatacept (T-cell-specific inhibitor). Treatment was initiated in adult Marfan mice with already existing aortic root dilatation, and applied for eight weeks. Methylprednisolone- or abatacept-treated mice did not reveal a reduction in aortic root dilatation. In this short time frame, losartan was the only treatment that significantly reduced aorta inflammation, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling and aortic root dilatation rate in these adult Marfan mice. Moreover, the methylprednisolone-treated mice had significantly more aortic alcian blue staining as a marker for aortic damage.Anti-inflammatory agents do not reduce the aortic dilatation rate in Marfan mice, but possibly increase aortic damage. Currently, the most promising therapeutic drug in Marfan syndrome is losartan, by blocking the angiotensin II receptor type 1 and thereby inhibiting pSmad2 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1985579322,"Background It is not clear whether elevated uric acid is a risk factor for the onset of impaired fasting glucose after stratifying by baseline fasting plasma glucose levels. We conducted a community-based retrospective longitudinal cohort study to clarify the relationship between uric acid levels and the onset of impaired fasting glucose, according to baseline fasting plasma glucose levels. Methods We enrolled 6,403 persons (3,194 men and 3,209 women), each of whom was 18–80 years old and had >2 annual check-ups during 2003–2010. After excluding persons who had fasting plasma glucose levels ≥6.11 mM and/or were currently taking anti-diabetic agents, the remaining 5,924 subjects were classified into quartiles according to baseline fasting plasma glucose levels. The onset of impaired fasting glucose was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥6.11 mM during the observation period. Results In the quartile groups, 0.9%, 2.1%, 3.4%, and 20.2% of the men developed impaired fasting glucose, respectively, and 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, and 5.6% of the women developed impaired fasting glucose, respectively (P trend <0.001). After adjusting for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triacylglycerols, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, creatinine, fatty liver, family history of diabetes, alcohol consumption, and current smoking, uric acid levels were positively associated with onset of impaired fasting glucose in men with highest-quartile fasting plasma glucose levels (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.003; 95% confidence interval, 1.0001–1.005, P = 0.041). Conclusions Among men with high fasting plasma glucose, hyperuricemia may be independently associated with an elevated risk of developing impaired fasting glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2113025711,"We used demographic and clinical data to design practical classification models for prediction of neurocognitive impairment (NCI) in people with HIV infection.The study population comprised 331 HIV-infected patients with available demographic, clinical, and neurocognitive data collected using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Classification and regression trees (CART) were developed to obtain detailed and reliable models to predict NCI. Following a practical clinical approach, NCI was considered the main variable for study outcomes, and analyses were performed separately in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients.The study sample comprised 52 treatment-naïve and 279 experienced patients. In the first group, the variables identified as better predictors of NCI were CD4 cell count and age (correct classification [CC]: 79.6%, 3 final nodes). In treatment-experienced patients, the variables most closely related to NCI were years of education, nadir CD4 cell count, central nervous system penetration-effectiveness score, age, employment status, and confounding comorbidities (CC: 82.1%, 7 final nodes). In patients with an undetectable viral load and no comorbidities, we obtained a fairly accurate model in which the main variables were nadir CD4 cell count, current CD4 cell count, time on current treatment, and past highest viral load (CC: 88%, 6 final nodes).Practical classification models to predict NCI in HIV infection can be obtained using demographic and clinical variables. An approach based on CART analyses may facilitate screening for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and complement clinical information about risk and protective factors for NCI in HIV-infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W1988622660,"Studies of plant invasions rarely address impacts on molluscs. By comparing pairs of invaded and corresponding uninvaded plots in 96 sites in floodplain forests, we examined effects of four invasive alien plants (Impatiens glandulifera, Fallopia japonica, F. sachalinensis, and F.×bohemica) in the Czech Republic on communities of land snails. The richness and abundance of living land snail species were recorded separately for all species, rare species listed on the national Red List, and small species with shell size below 5 mm. The significant impacts ranged from 16–48% reduction in snail species numbers, and 29–90% reduction in abundance. Small species were especially prone to reduction in species richness by all four invasive plant taxa. Rare snails were also negatively impacted by all plant invaders, both in terms of species richness or abundance. Overall, the impacts on snails were invader-specific, differing among plant taxa. The strong effect of I. glandulifera could be related to the post-invasion decrease in abundance of tall nitrophilous native plant species that are a nutrient-rich food source for snails in riparian habitats. Fallopia sachalinensis had the strongest negative impact of the three knotweeds, which reflects differences in their canopy structure, microhabitat humidity and litter decomposition. The ranking of Fallopia taxa according to the strength of impacts on snail communities differs from ranking by their invasiveness, known from previous studies. This indicates that invasiveness does not simply translate to impacts of invasion and needs to be borne in mind by conservation and management authorities."
https://openalex.org/W2054503222,"Background The underlying mechanisms of the association between ambient temperature and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are not well understood, particularly for daily temperature variability. We evaluated if daily mean temperature and standard deviation of temperature was associated with heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) duration, a marker of ventricular repolarization in a prospective cohort of older men. Methods This longitudinal analysis included 487 older men participating in the VA Normative Aging Study with up to three visits between 2000–2008 (n = 743). We analyzed associations between QTc and moving averages (1–7, 14, 21, and 28 days) of the 24-hour mean and standard deviation of temperature as measured from a local weather monitor, and the 24-hour mean temperature estimated from a spatiotemporal prediction model, in time-varying linear mixed-effect regression. Effect modification by season, diabetes, coronary heart disease, obesity, and age was also evaluated. Results Higher mean temperature as measured from the local monitor, and estimated from the prediction model, was associated with longer QTc at moving averages of 21 and 28 days. Increased 24-hr standard deviation of temperature was associated with longer QTc at moving averages from 4 and up to 28 days; a 1.9°C interquartile range increase in 4-day moving average standard deviation of temperature was associated with a 2.8 msec (95%CI: 0.4, 5.2) longer QTc. Associations between 24-hr standard deviation of temperature and QTc were stronger in colder months, and in participants with diabetes and coronary heart disease. Conclusion/Significance In this sample of older men, elevated mean temperature was associated with longer QTc, and increased variability of temperature was associated with longer QTc, particularly during colder months and among individuals with diabetes and coronary heart disease. These findings may offer insight of an important underlying mechanism of temperature-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in an older population."
https://openalex.org/W2079184328,"Stress granules (SGs) are compartmentalized messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) where translationally repressed mRNAs are stored when cells encounter environmental stress. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB)4 is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein and translational regulator. In keeping with the results obtained from the study of other RNA-binding proteins, we found CPEB4 localized in SGs in various arsenite-treated cells. In this study, we identified that Vinexin, a CPEB4-interacting protein, is a novel component of SGs. Vinexin is a SH3-domain-containing adaptor protein and affects cell migration through its association with Vinculin to localize at focal adhesions (FAs). Unexpectedly, Vinexin is translocated from FAs to SGs under arsenite-induced stress. The recruitment of Vinexin to SGs depends on its interaction with CPEB4 and influences SG formation and cell survival. Arsenite-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling enhances the association between CPEB4 and Vinexin, which consequently facilitates SG localization of Vinexin. Taken together, this study uncovers a novel interaction between a translational regulator and an adaptor protein to influence SG assembly and cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2028582088,"Group IV Nanowires have strong potential for several biomedical applications. However, to date their use remains limited because many are synthesised using heavy metal seeds and functionalised using organic ligands to make the materials water dispersible. This can result in unpredicted toxic side effects for mammalian cells cultured on the wires. Here, we describe an approach to make seedless and ligand free Germanium nanowires water dispersible using glutamic acid, a natural occurring amino acid that alleviates the environmental and health hazards associated with traditional functionalisation materials. We analysed the treated material extensively using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), High resolution-TEM, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Using a series of state of the art biochemical and morphological assays, together with a series of complimentary and synergistic cellular and molecular approaches, we show that the water dispersible germanium nanowires are non-toxic and are biocompatible. We monitored the behaviour of the cells growing on the treated germanium nanowires using a real time impedance based platform (xCELLigence) which revealed that the treated germanium nanowires promote cell adhesion and cell proliferation which we believe is as a result of the presence of an etched surface giving rise to a collagen like structure and an oxide layer. Furthermore this study is the first to evaluate the associated effect of Germanium nanowires on mammalian cells. Our studies highlight the potential use of water dispersible Germanium Nanowires in biological platforms that encourage anchorage-dependent cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2047881016,"We sought to determine a role for platelets in in vivo angiogenesis, quantified by changes in the capillary to fibre ratio (C∶F) of mouse skeletal muscle, utilising two distinct forms of capillary growth to identify differential effects. Capillary sprouting was induced by muscle overload, and longitudinal splitting by chronic hyperaemia. Platelet depletion was achieved by anti-GPIbα antibody treatment. Sprouting induced a significant increase in C∶F (1.42±0.02 vs. contralateral 1.29±0.02, P<0.001) that was abolished by platelet depletion, while the significant C∶F increase caused by splitting (1.40±0.03 vs. control 1.28±0.03, P<0.01) was unaffected. Granulocyte/monocyte depletion showed this response was not immune-regulated. VEGF overexpression failed to rescue angiogenesis following platelet depletion, suggesting the mechanism is not simply reliant on growth factor release. Sprouting occurred normally following antibody-induced GPVI shedding, suggesting platelet activation via collagen is not involved. BrdU pulse-labelling showed no change in the proliferative potential of cells associated with capillaries after platelet depletion. Inhibition of platelet activation by acetylsalicylic acid abolished sprouting, but not splitting angiogenesis, paralleling the response to platelet depletion. We conclude that platelets differentially regulate mechanisms of angiogenesis in vivo, likely via COX signalling. Since endothelial proliferation is not impaired, we propose a link between COX1 and induction of endothelial migration."
https://openalex.org/W1988825718,"Species distributions are known to be limited by biotic and abiotic factors at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Species distribution models, however, frequently assume a population at equilibrium in both time and space. Studies of habitat selection have repeatedly shown the difficulty of estimating resource selection if the scale or extent of analysis is incorrect. Here, we present a multi-step approach to estimate the realized and potential distribution of the endangered giant kangaroo rat. First, we estimate the potential distribution by modeling suitability at a range-wide scale using static bioclimatic variables. We then examine annual changes in extent at a population-level. We define “available” habitat based on the total suitable potential distribution at the range-wide scale. Then, within the available habitat, model changes in population extent driven by multiple measures of resource availability. By modeling distributions for a population with robust estimates of population extent through time, and ecologically relevant predictor variables, we improved the predictive ability of SDMs, as well as revealed an unanticipated relationship between population extent and precipitation at multiple scales. At a range-wide scale, the best model indicated the giant kangaroo rat was limited to areas that received little to no precipitation in the summer months. In contrast, the best model for shorter time scales showed a positive relation with resource abundance, driven by precipitation, in the current and previous year. These results suggest that the distribution of the giant kangaroo rat was limited to the wettest parts of the drier areas within the study region. This multi-step approach reinforces the differing relationship species may have with environmental variables at different scales, provides a novel method for defining “available” habitat in habitat selection studies, and suggests a way to create distribution models at spatial and temporal scales relevant to theoretical and applied ecologists."
https://openalex.org/W1986414096,"Human DNA polymerase β (polβ) has been suggested to play a role in cisplatin resistance, especially in polβ-overexpressing cancer cells. Polβ has been shown to accurately albeit slowly bypass the cisplatin-1,2-d(GpG) (Pt-GG) intramolecular cross-link in vitro. Currently, the structural basis for the inefficient Pt-GG bypass mechanism of polβ is unknown. To gain structural insights into the mechanism, we determined two ternary structures of polβ incorporating dCTP opposite the templating Pt-GG lesion in the presence of the active site Mg(2+) or Mn(2+). The Mg(2+)-bound structure shows that the bulky Pt-GG adduct is accommodated in the polβ active site without any steric hindrance. In addition, both guanines of the Pt-GG lesion form Watson-Crick base pairing with the primer terminus dC and the incoming dCTP, providing the structural basis for the accurate bypass of the Pt-GG adduct by polβ. The Mn(2+)-bound structure shows that polβ adopts a catalytically suboptimal semiclosed conformation during the insertion of dCTP opposite the templating Pt-GG, explaining the inefficient replication across the Pt-GG lesion by polβ. Overall, our studies provide the first structural insights into the mechanism of the potential polβ-mediated cisplatin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2084718807,"The genetic diversity of plants has traditionally been employed to improve crop plants to suit human needs, and in the future feed the increasing population and protect crops from environmental stresses and climate change. Genome-wide sequencing is a reality and can be used to make association to crop traits to be utilized by high-throughput marker based selection methods. This study describes a strategy of using next generation sequencing (NGS) data from the rice genome to make comparisons to the high-quality reference genome, identify functional polymorphisms within genes that might result in function changes and be used to study correlations to traits and employed in genetic mapping. We analyzed the NGS data of Oryza sativa ssp indica cv. G4 covering 241 Mb with ∼20X coverage and compared to the reference genome of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica to describe the genome-wide distribution of gene-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The analysis shows that the 63% covered genome consists of 1.6 million SNPs with 6.9 SNPs/Kb, and including 80,146 insertions and 92,655 deletions (INDELs) genome-wide. There are a total of 1,139,801 intergenic SNPs, 295,136 SNPs in intronic/non-coding regions, 195,098 in coding regions, 23,242 SNPs at the five-prime (5′) UTR regions and 22,686 SNPs at the three-prime (3′) UTR region. SNP variation was found in 40,761 gene loci, which include 75,262 synonymous and 119,836 non-synonymous changes, and functional reading frame changes through 3,886 inducing STOP-codon (isSNP) and 729 preventing STOP-codon (psSNP) variation. There are quickly evolving 194 high SNP hotspot genes (>100 SNPs/gene), and 1,513 out of 2,458 transcription factors displaying 2,294 non-synonymous SNPs that can be a major source of phenotypic diversity within the species. All data is searchable at https://plantstress-pereira.uark.edu/oryza2. We envision that this strategy will be useful for the identification of genes for crop traits and molecular breeding of rice cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2009779784,"Asymptomatic malaria infection in refugees is both a threat to the lives of the individuals and the public in the host country. Although South Africa has been experiencing an unprecedented influx of refugees since 1994, data on malaria infection among refugees is lacking. Such information is critical since South Africa is among the countries that have planned to eliminate malaria. The objective of this study was to determine prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infection among a refugee population living in a city of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.A survey was conducted on adult refugee participants who attended a faith-based facility offering social services in a city of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. The participants were screened for the presence of malaria using rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy. Demographic data for the participants were obtained using a closed ended questionnaire. Data was obtained for 303 participants consisting of 51.5% females and 47.5% males, ranging from 19 to 64 years old. More than 95% of them originated from sub-Saharan African countries. Two hundred and ninety participants provided a blood sample for screening of malaria. Of these, 3.8% tested positive for rapid diagnostic test and 5.9% for microscopy. The majority of malaria infections were due to Plasmodium falciparum.The study confirms the presence of asymptomatic malaria infections among a refugee population residing in a city of KwaZulu-Natal province that is not endemic for malaria. The results have important implications for both public health and malaria control in South Africa, particularly since the country has decided to eliminate malaria by 2018. To achieve this goal, South Africa needs to expand research, surveillance and elimination activities to include non-endemic areas, particularly with high refugee populations. We further recommend use of powerful diagnostic tests such as PCR for these interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1993015285,"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTA + stent) has gained acceptance as a primary treatment modality for the superficial femoral artery (SFA) diseases. Popliteal artery embolization (PAE) is a severe complication in SFA interventions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, treatment and prognosis of PAE in primary SFA PTA + stent.Chronic SFA arteriosclerosis cases that underwent primary PTA + stent were reviewed from a retrospectively maintained database. Runoff vessels were evaluated in all cases before and after the interventions for PAE detection. The primary patency, secondary patency and limb salvage rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using log-rank analysis. Cox multivariate regression was performed to evaluate predictors of patency and limb salvage rates.There were 436 lesions treated in 388 patients with 10 PAE events (2.3%) in total. PAE rate was significantly higher in Transatlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) C/D group compared with TASC A/B group (OR = 8.91, P = .002), in chronic total occlusion (CTO) lesions compared with stenotic lesions (P<.0001), and in group with history of cerebral ischemic stroke (OR = 6.11, P = .007). PAE rates were not significantly affected by age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and runoff status. The binary logistic regression showed that only the TASC C/D was an independent predictor of PAE (P = .031). The 12-month and 24-month primary patency, secondary patency and limb salvage rates in PAE group showed no significant differences comparing with non-PAE group.PAE is a rare event in primary SFA PTA + stent. TASC C/D lesion, CTO and cerebral ischemic stroke history are risk factors for PAE. PAE is typically reversible by comprehensive techniques. If the popliteal flow is restored in time, PAE has no significant effect on long-term patency and limb salvage rates."
https://openalex.org/W1969395500,"We characterize the conformational dynamics and substrate selectivity of the signal recognition particle (SRP) using a thermodynamic free energy cycle approach and microsecond timescale molecular dynamics simulations. The SRP is a central component of the co-translational protein targeting machinery that binds to the N-terminal signal peptide (SP) of nascent proteins. We determined the shift in relative conformational stability of the SRP upon substrate binding to quantify allosteric coupling between SRP domains. In particular, for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, an SP that is recognized by the SRP for co-translational targeting, it is found that substrate binding induces substantial changes in the SRP toward configurations associated with targeting of the nascent protein, and it is found that the changes are modestly enhanced by a mutation that increases the hydrophobicity of the SP. However, for alkaline phosphatase, an SP that is recognized for post-translational targeting, substrate binding induces the reverse change in the SRP conformational distribution away from targeting configurations. Microsecond timescale trajectories reveal the intrinsic flexibility of the SRP conformational landscape and provide insight into recent single molecule studies by illustrating that 10-nm lengthscale changes between FRET pairs occur via the rigid-body movement of SRP domains connected by the flexible linker region.

Throughout this paper, we refer to these two conformations as syn and anti, indicating the relative orientation of the SRP RNA and the NG domain. Biochemical evidence suggests that SP binding influences the kinetics of downstream targeting events, such as dimerization of the SRP with its receptor, GTPase activity of the SRP, and final release of the RNC from the SRP to the translocon channel (30Zhang X. Rashid R. Wang K. Shan S.O. Sequential checkpoints govern substrate selection during cotranslational protein targeting.Science. 2010; 328: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Truncation or modification of the SP has additionally been shown to modulate the rate of these targeting events (31Egea P.F. Stroud R.M. Walter P.

Rashid R. Wang K. Shan S.O. Sequential checkpoints govern substrate selection during cotranslational protein targeting.Science. 2010; 328: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the anti conformation of the SRP places the universally conserved tetraloop end of its RNA in close proximity with its catalytic NG domain (19Hainzl T. Huang S. Meriläinen G.

The thermodynamic cycle employed in this study allows us to equate the difference in binding FE of the SP to different conformations of the SRP to SRP conformational changes upon SP binding and reduces the demands of protein conformational sampling. We calculate the allosteric effect induced by SP binding for a range of experimentally studied SPs to investigate the effect of changing the SP amino acid sequence. Furthermore, we reveal details of the large scale SRP conformational rearrangements by performing several microsecond timescale (MD) trajectories. Taken together, these calculations provide insight into the sensitivity of the SRP conformational changes to the identity of the SP. In particular, the results of this study reveal that the conformational preference of the SRP for the anti over the syn conformation upon SP binding agrees with trends found in experimentally measured targeting efficiencies, suggesting that SRP conformational dynamics are substrate-specific and provide a selection mechanism of nascent proteins for the co-translational targeting pathway. Initial coordinates for the syn conformation of the SRP are available from the high resolution crystal structure of the archaeal Sulfolobus solfataricus species (Protein Data Bank code 1QZW) (20Rosendal K.R. Wild K. Montoya G. Sinning I. Crystal structure of the complete core of archaeal signal recognition particle and implications for interdomain communication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 14701-14706Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Coordinates for the anti conformation of the SRP from S. solfataricus have not been reported in a crystallographic study, so they are instead modeled from the available M. jannaschii structure (Protein Data Bank code 3NDB) (19Hainzl T. Huang S. Meriläinen G. Brännström K. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Structural basis of signal-sequence recognition by the signal recognition particle.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) as follows. A pairwise sequence alignment of the S. solfataricus and Methanococcus jannaschii sequences is performed using ClustalX (50Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Clustal W and Clustal X version 2.0.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (22512) Google Scholar) and input into MODELLER (51Eswar N. Webb B. Marti-Renom M.A. Madhusudhan M. Eramian D. Shen M.-Y. Pieper U. Sali A. Comparative protein structure modeling using modeller.Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2006; (2006 Chapter 5, Unit 5.6)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MODELLER protocol builds coordinates for the S. solfataricus SRP in the anti conformation that minimizes a set of the spatial restraints generated from the sequence alignment with the existing M. jannaschii structure and a set of stereochemical restraints determined from the CHARMM22 force field (52MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B.

All-atom empirical potential for molecular modeling and dynamics studies of proteins.J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (11686) Google Scholar). The model coordinates are refined with conjugate gradient minimization and molecular dynamics with simulated annealing. The FE associated with SP binding to either the syn and anti conformations of the SRP is calculated for three SPs, listed in Table 1. The first is dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAP-WT), a prototypical example of a peptide sequence that is targeted to the co-translational targeting pathway (53Ng D.T. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The second SP, DPAP-K464L, is obtained from the DPAP-WT sequence by a single lysine-to-leucine mutation at residue 464. This mutation extends the hydrophobic region of the SP relative to the DPAP-WT. The third SP is PhoA, which is found to bind SRP in vitro (10Gierasch L.M. Signal sequences.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), but only weakly targets proteins via the co-translational targeting pathway (30Zhang X. Rashid R. Wang K. Shan S.O. Sequential checkpoints govern substrate selection during cotranslational protein targeting.Science. 2010; 328: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); the in vivo systems alternatively select PhoA for the post-translational SecB pathway (54Huber D. Boyd D. Xia Y. Olma M.H. Gerstein M. Beckwith J. Use of thioredoxin as a reporter to identify a subset of Escherichia coli signal sequences that promote signal recognition particle-dependent translocation.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2983-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of the DPAP-WT SP bound to the syn conformation of the SRP is available (Protein Data Bank code 3KL4) (17Janda C.Y. Li J. Oubridge C. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Nagai K. Recognition of a signal peptide by the signal recognition particle.Nature. 2010; 465: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and is used to initialize coordinates for simulations of the bound DPAP-WT. The coordinates for bound DPAP-K464L are constructed via direct substitution of the leucine side chain coordinates in DPAP-WT at residue 464 with lysine coordinates, followed by steepest descent minimization to remove steric clashes (55Fletcher R. Powell M.J.D. A rapidly convergent descent method for minimization.Comput. J. 1963; 6: 163-168Crossref Google Scholar). The coordinates for bound PhoA are constructed by sequence alignment with the DPAP-WT SP and modeled by the MODELLER protocol described previously. We note that the N-terminal end of the SP sequences are capped using a neutral acetyl group, rather than a positively charged bare ammonium terminus, to account for the fact that in the experimental crystal structure (17Janda C.Y. Li J. Oubridge C. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Nagai K. Recognition of a signal peptide by the signal recognition particle.Nature. 2010; 465: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) the N terminus of the SP sequence is bonded to additional residues that are not resolved; and for the simulations to include a bare ammonium terminus at the N-terminal end of the SP would introduce an unphysical charge at that point in the sequence.TABLE 1Summary of the sequences and features of studied SPsSPSequenceV(Å3)aExcluded volume of the SP, was determined by VMD volmap (82).FeaturesDPAP-WTGIILVLLIWGTVLLLKSIPH3291Efficient co-translational targeting sequenceDPAP-K464LGIILVLLIWGTVLLLLSIPH3178Single-point mutation from WTPhoAIALALLPLLFTPVTKA2338Inefficient co-translational targeting sequencea Excluded volume of the SP, was determined by VMD volmap (82Humphrey W.

Open table in a new tab We performed nine sets of calculations to determine the FE of binding for each of the three SPs to the SRP in the syn or anti conformation. For the ith SP, these calculations yield, ΔG(aq)(i), ΔGS (SRP)(i), and ΔGA (SRP)(i), which are, respectively, the FE of aqueous solvation for the SP, the FE associated with transferring the SP from the vacuum state to binding the solvated SRP in the syn conformation, and the FE associated with transferring the SP from the vacuum state to binding the solvated SRP in the anti conformation. These quantities are then used to compute the FE of SP binding, ΔGS/A(i) = ΔGS/A (SRP)(i) − ΔG(aq)(i). In this study, each calculation of a FE difference was performed using the FE perturbation (FEP) method in two stages. The first stage involves “turning on” the Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions between the SP and the remaining atoms in the system. The second stage involves turning on the electrostatic interactions between the SP and the remaining atoms. For each stage, independent sampling trajectories were performed with potential energy functions that corresponding to different values of the parameter λ, as shown in Equation 1, v(λ)=(1−λ)v0+λv1(Eq. 1) For the first stage, in which the LJ interactions are turned on, V0 refers to the noninteracting state, and V1 refers to the state with fully interacting LJ potentials. To ensure the use of smooth potential energy functions during this process (56Beutler T.C. Mark A.E. van Schaik R.C. Gerber P.R. van Gunsteren W.F.

Prior detailed studies of selected systems have highlighted mechanistic features that distinguish different phosphoryl transfer enzymes. Here, a top-down approach is developed for comparing statistically the active site configurations between populations of diverse structures in the Protein Data Bank, and it reveals patterns of hydrogen bonding that transcend enzyme families. Through analysis of large samples of structures, insights are drawn at a level of detail exceeding the experimental precision of an individual structure. In phosphagen kinases, for example, hydrogen bonds with the O3β of the nucleotide substrate are revealed as analogous to those in unrelated G proteins. In G proteins and other enzymes, interactions with O3β have been understood in terms of electrostatic favoring of the transition state. Ground state quantum mechanical calculations on model compounds show that the active site interactions highlighted in our database analysis can affect substrate phosphate charge and bond length, in ways that are consistent with prior experimental observations, by modulating hyperconjugative orbital interactions that weaken the scissile bond. Testing experimentally the inference about the importance of O3β interactions in phosphagen kinases, mutation of arginine kinase Arg280 decreases kcat, as predicted, with little impact upon KM."
