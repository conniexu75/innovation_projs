https://openalex.org/W2060873042,"Microelectrode mapping experiments indicate that the classical primary somatosensory cortex of monkeys consists of as many as four separate body representations rather than just one. Two complete body surface representations occupy cortical fields 3b and 1. In addition, area 2 contains an orderly representation of predominantly ""deep"" body tissues. Area 3a may constitute a fourth representation."

In contrast, the posterior cingulate cortex receives afferents primarily from the anterior thalamic nuclei and from extensive cortical areas in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. These contrasting afferents may provide a structural basis for pain-related functions of the anterior cingulate cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2018964466,"The effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone and 17 β-estradiol on the electrical membrane properties of a prolactin-secreting pituitary cell line (GH3/B6) were studied with intracellular microelectrode recordings. Of the cells tested, 50 percent were excitable and displayed calcium-dependent action potentials when depolarized. When injected directly on the membrane of an excitable cell, thyrotropin-releasing hormone and 17 β-estradiol induced action potentials within 1 minute. The spiking activity was preceded by a progressive increase of the input resistance without any detectable change in the resting membrane polarization. The results reveal a rapid effect of both substances on the membrane of GH3/B6 cells. In the case of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, which has both a short-term effect on release of prolactin and a long-term effect on its synthesis, the induced electrical activity may be associated with the stimulation of prolactin production. The physiological implication of 17 β-estradiol-induced, calcium-dependent spiking activity remains to be elucidated."

https://openalex.org/W1587615515,"A guanine insertion enzyme (tRNA transglycosylase) was purified to a homogeneous state from Escherichia coli B by ammonium sulfate fractionation and DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-Sephadex A-50, phosphocellulose, and Sephadex G-200 column chromatographies. The molecular weight of the enzyme, which appeared to be a single polypeptide, was 4.6 X 10(4) by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The enzyme catalyzes exchange of guanine with guanine located in the first position of the anticodon of tRNATyr, tRNAHis, tRNAAsn, and tRNAAsp, but unlike the enzymes isolated from rabbit reticulocytes and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells it does not catalyze the exchange of guanine with queuine (7-(3,4-trans-4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1-cyclopenten-3-ylaminomethyl)-7-deazaguanine) present in these tRNAs. The pH optimum of the reaction was 7.0, and the pH1 value was 4.6 to 4.8. The reaction required Mg2+ ion. 7-Methylguanine inhibited guanine insertion, but the other purine analogues tested were not inhibitory and could not replace guanine.20"

The Japanese macaques consistently performed best on peak position and the other species on pitch. The results imply special strategies for perceptual processing of vocal sounds and suggest parallels with human speech perception.
https://openalex.org/W1480783430,"The specific glucocorticoid binding capacity in cytosols prepared from L929 mouse fibroblasts (L cells) is inactivated with a half-life of approximately 2 h at 25 degrees C. As previously published, this inactivation can be prevented with 10 mM molybdate and markedly slowed by addition of other phosphatase inhibitors such as glucose 1-phosphate and fluoride. We have now found that ATP (5 to 10 mM) also slows the rate of this inactivation. After extensively inactivating the receptor by preincubating cytosol at 25 degrees C for 4 and preventing further inactivation by addition of molybdate, addition of ATP results in reactivation of the steroid binding capacity. Maximal reactivation of 40 to 70% is achieved with 5 to 10 mM ATP. The activation is temperature-dependent and specific for ATP. ADP, GTP, CTP, and UTP do not cause activation and preliminary results indicate no effect of cyclic nucleotides in this system. If activation is prevented by addition of 10 mM EDTA to the cytosol, addition of 3 to 10 mM magnesium permits ATP-dependent activation of the binding capacity. The level of reactivation can be enhanced by addition of a heat-stable factor prepared from the same L cell supernatant. These results support the proposal that L cell glucocorticoid receptors can be activated to the glucocorticoid binding state by an ATP-dependent phosphorylation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1592430696,"Human renin was purified from a juxtaglomerular cell tumor with a high renin content, 24.2 Goldblatt units/mg of protein. The purification procedure comprised three steps: gel filtration, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and preparative isoelectric focusing. Five forms of renin amounting to 5.3 mg of enzyme were obtained with isoelectric points of 4.95, 5.10, 5.35, 5.55, and 5.70. They were all glycoproteins. The three major fractions had very similar specific activities, 868, 860, and 809 Goldblatt units/mg of protein. These fractions produced a single band on analytical isoelectric focusing and a single arc on immunoelectrophoresis. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 7.8, each fraction consisted of two renin bands with the same molecular weight, but different net charges. The molecular weight determined by gel filtration and Fergusson plot analysis on polyacrylamide gel was 38,000 to 42,000. The optimum pH determined on N-acetyltetradecapeptide substrate was 6.5, and the Km was 6.8 x 10(-6) M. These parameters were identical with those for standard human kidney renin. Antibodies raised against tumor renin completely inhibited the activity of both tumor and standard renin. Under dissociating conditions (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel electrophoresis in the presence of 6 M urea), part of the purified enzyme dissociated into two smaller fragments (Mr = 20,000 and 25,000) containing renin activity."

Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase solubilized from a microsomal fraction catalyzed the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 in the presence of heme and tryptophan. Prostaglandin D synthetase (prostaglandin endoperoxidase-D isomerase) catalyzing the isomerization of prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2 was found predominantly in a cytosol fraction and was purified to apparent homogeneity with a specific activity of 1.7 mumol/min/mg of protein at 24 degrees C. The enzyme also acted upon prostaglandin G2 and produced a compound presumed to be 15-hydroperoxy-prostaglandin D2. Glutathione was not required for the enzyme reaction, but the enzyme was stabilized by thiol compounds including glutathione. The enzyme was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid in a reversible manner. The purified enzyme was essentially free of the glutathione S-transferase activity which was found in the cytosol of brain."
https://openalex.org/W1522574153,"In order to establish the complete amino acid sequence of the human IgA alpha1 chain Bur, IgA1 protease from Streptococcus sanguis was employed to generate Fabalpha and Fcalpha fragments in the final stage of this investigation. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of the Fabalpha fragment followed by reduction and aminoethylation produced the Fd' fragment (residues 84 to 227); this contains part of the variable region (VR), the whole first constant domain (Calpha1), and part of the hinge region of this heavy chain. The tryptic peptides of the Fd' fragment were isolated, characterized, and sequenced. The results together with the data in the preceding papers on chymotryptic, tryptic, and thermolysin peptides permitted the complete amino acid sequence of the human IgA alpha1 chain to be established."

https://openalex.org/W1538018503,"[3H7]Prostaglandin D2 was biosynthesized and infused into an unanesthetized monkey. The urinary metabolites were isolated and subsequently identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two pathways of prostaglandin D2 metabolism were identified and resulted in metabolites with prostaglandin D (3-hydroxycyclopentanone) and prostaglandin F (cyclopentane-1,3-diol) ring structures. The major prostaglandin D ring metabolite was identified as 9,20-dihydroxy-11,15-dioxo-2,3-dinorprost-5-en-1-oic acid. Nine other prostaglandin D ring metabolites were identified reflecting various combinations of metabolism by beta and omega oxidation, 15 dehydrogenation, and 13-14 reduction. In greater abundance were those prostaglandin D2 metabolites which had the prostaglandin F ring structure. The major prostaglandin D2 metabolite which had the prostaglandin F ring structure was identified as 9,11,15-trihydroxy-2,3-dinorprosta-5,13-dien-1-oic acid (dinor prostaglandin F2 alpha). Nine other metabolites with the prostaglandin F ring structure were identified, including prostaglandin F2 alpha itself. These, for the most part, were the structural counterparts of the metabolites with the prostaglandin D ring. Since many prostaglandin D2 metabolites were found to be identical with the metabolites of prostaglandin F2 alpha, quantitative determinations of prostaglandin F ring metabolites may not be a specific indicator of prostaglandin F2 alpha biosynthesis. Likewise, data involving the measurement of a biological effect of prostaglandin D2 must be re-examined to account for the possible contribution of prostaglandin F2 alpha, a metabolite of prostaglandin D2, to the biological response."

https://openalex.org/W1484767440,"Abstract An azoreductase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from the hepatic 105,000 x g supernatant fraction of 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. In the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the purified enzyme preparation electrophoreses on polyacrylamide gels as a single protein band with a molecular weight of 30,000. In the absence of detergent, chromatography of the azoreductase on Sephadex G-100 gives a molecular weight of about 52,000 suggesting that the native enzyme may exist as a dimer. The purified azoreductase has a typical flavoprotein absorption spectrum and contains 2 mol of FAD/mol of enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes the reductive fission of methyl red (2'-carboxy-4-N,N-dimethylaminoazobenzene) and a structure-activity study indicates that the 2'-carboxyl group of methyl red is essential for catalysis since other structurally related analogs are totally inactive."

https://openalex.org/W1598383366,"Proteins S8 and S15 from the 30 S ribosomal subunit of Escherichia coli were bound to 16 S RNA and digested with ribonuclease A. A ribonucleoprotein complex was isolated which contained the two proteins and three noncontiguous RNA subfragments totaling 93 nucleotides, that could be unambiguously located in the 16 S RNA sequence. We present a secondary structural model for the RNA moiety of the binding site complex, in which the two smaller fragments are extensively base-paired, respectively, to the two halves of the large fragment, to form two disconnected duplexes. Each of the two duplexes is interrupted by a small internal loop. This model is supported by (i) minimum energy considerations, (ii) sites of cleavage by ribonuclease A, and (iii) modification by the single strand-specific reagent kethoxal. The effect of protein binding on the topography of the complex is reflected in the kethoxal reactivity of the RNA moiety. In the absence of the proteins, 5 guanines are modified; 4 of these, at positions 663, 732, 733, and 741, are strongly protected from kethoxal when protein S15 is bound."
https://openalex.org/W2053155992,"INTERFERON has antiviral effects both in vivo and in vitro. Viral replication is inhibited in interferon-treated cells in vitro because the reproductive cycle of the virus is inhibited at the transcriptional or translational level, depending on the virus–cell system studied1. This direct inhibition of viral replication has been assumed to also be the mechanism by which interferon exerts its antiviral effect in vivo. We report here results that indicate protection by interferon against viral infection in vivo without inhibition of the viral replication of the same virus in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1574652624,"Cathepsin B was isolated from porcine parathyroid tissue and from liver by a procedure involving acetone precipitation, gel filtration, and carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. The final preparations of each migrated as single bands upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels but exhibited several minor active variants upon isoelectric focusing. The parathyroid and liver enzymes were similar to each other and also resembled cathepsin B from other sources. The molecular weights for the porcine enzymes were estimated as 25,000, and the isoelectric point was at pH 4.8. The parathyroid enzyme cleaved benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg-(4-methoxy)-2-naphthylamide at pH 5.8 and 37 degrees C with a Km of 0.14 mM and a kcat of 68 s-1. The pH optimum for this reaction was pH 6 to 7. The enzyme was unstable above pH 7.5 and below pH 4.5. It was strongly inhibited by HgCl2, ZnSO4, iodoacetate, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmaleimide which indicated that it is a thiol protease, and by leupeptin, a strong inhibitor of cathepsin B from other sources. Antibodies to the parathyroid enzyme were elicited in rabbits. The antisera formed single precipitin bands upon double diffusion in agar gels against both the parathyroid and liver enzymes. Precipitin bands were formed at both pH 6 and pH 8.5 which indicated that the antisera recognized both native and denatured forms of the enzymes."

The majority of the AGMr(HindIII)-1 sequences are organized in long tandem repeats of a segment of 172 base pairs in length. However, a fraction of the AGMr (HindIII)-1 sequences is interspersed with another 37% of the genome.

Small amounts of pure PBP 2b could be isolated by manipulation of the affinity chromatography conditions. Structural and physical properties of these proteins as well as the generation of one major penicilloyl peptide from each PBP by digestion with pepsin suggest that each PBP is the product of a separate gene.

To examine the requirement for ongoing fatty acid synthesis and/or elongation in the aldosterone-induced alteration of cellular protein metabolism in the toad's urinary bladder, the effect of TPIA has been examined in double-labeled amino acid incorporation experiments. TPIA itself has no effect on the pattern of protein labeling in either the or a plasma membrane-enriched fraction. However, inhibition of fatty acid synthesis selectively inhibits the aldosterone-induced incorporation of membrane proteins without altering the labeling of soluble cell protein. These results indicate that ongoing fatty acid synthesis is required for the hormone-induced changes in plasma membrane protein metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1982616430,"Competition assays for estradiol receptors in cytosol preparations of uteri from rhesus monkeys and humans showed that delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) does not compete with estradiol for intracellular estrogen recptors. Although isotopically labeled THC bound to macromolecules in uterine cytosol from the rhesus monkey, the binding was not displaced by unlabeled THC, diethylstilbestrol, estradiol, progesterone, cortisol, or 5 alpha-dihydrostestosterone. Scatchard analyses indicated that high-affinity saturable binding of THC to cytosol did not occur. Thus the inhibitory effect of THC on gonadotropin and steroid secretion in primates is not mediated by the interaction of THC with intracellular steroid hormone receptors."
https://openalex.org/W199900031,"Abstract Antibodies against the trout testis nonhistone chromosomal protein, high mobility group protein T (HMG-T), have been elicited in goats. The antiserum was shown to be specific for HMG-T and did not cross-react with histone 1 or with the other two trout testis HMG proteins, H6 and ubiquitin. Purified anti-HMG-T IgG was used to determine the location of HMG-T within chromatin subunits separated on sucrose gradients. Binding of fluorescent labeled anti-HMG-T to these subunits clearly supports the notion that this protein is associated not with the nucleosome core but rather with the internucleosomal linker regions, and previously suggested (Levy W., B., Wong, N.C.W., and Dixon, G.

https://openalex.org/W1492556959,"We have tested the hypothesis that interconversion between multiple glucose-6-P-dependent forms of glycogen synthase helps regulate glycogen synthesis in adipose tissue. Our results indicate that interconversion of glycogen synthase in adipose tissue involves primarily dependent forms and that these interconversions were measured better by monitoring the activation constant (A0.5) for glucose-6-P than measuring the -: + glucose-6-P activity ratio. Insulin decreased and epinephrine increased the A0.5 for glucose-6-P without significant change in the activity ratio. Insulin consistently decreased the A0.5 in either the presence or absence of glucose, indicating that the insulin-promoted interconversion did not require increased hexose transport. Isoproterenol increased the A0.5 for glucose-6-P, while methoxamine was without effect, indicating beta receptors mediate adrenergic control of interconversion between glucose-6-P-dependent forms. The changes in the A0.5 produced by incubations with insulin or epinephrine were mutually reversible. We conclude that 1) glycogen synthesis in adipose tissue is catalyzed by multiple glucose-6-P-dependent forms of glycogen synthase, 2) hormones regulate glycogen metabolism by promoting reversible interconversions between these forms, and 3) there is no evidence that a glucose-6-P-independent form of glycogen synthase exists in intact adipose tissue."

Bio-Gel A-5m filtration of the solubilized components shows that all of the compounds necessary for peptidoglycan synthesis can be dissociated into material with a molecular weight of less than approximately 68,000. Using this reconstitution system, an assay has been developed for a new protein factor, PG-II, of B. megaterium. This factor could be combined with phospho-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide translocase and N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase to synthesize polymerized peptidoglycan from the precursors UDP-N-acetylmuramyl pentapeptide and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. In the absence of PG-II, the disaccharide pentapeptide substrate for the polymerase was accumulated. In the presence of this factor, the amount of the substrate was diminished and polymeric peptidoglycan was formed. Therefore, PG-II was likely to be necessary for the polymerization step and may well have been the polymerase itself. From three chromatographic steps developed for the purification of PG-II, it seemed likely that a single protein with a molecular weight of approximately 60,000 could have PG-II activity."

The newly incorporated methyl groups were distinguished from 3-O-methyl groups by the use of polysaccharide containing radioactively labeled endogenous methyl groups. The positions of methyl group localization were established by a proton magnetic resonance study of the intact methyl-replaced polysaccharide combined with an analysis of the constituent monosaccharides by gas-liquid chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry of their alditol acetate derivatives. These studies demonstrate that the acetyl groups are located at position 6 of approximately half of the 10 contiguous alpha(1 leads to 4)-linked 3-O-methyl-D-mannose residues. Purification of the polysaccharide was accomplished by an added step involving affinity chromatography on a column containing immobilized palmitoyl residues.

https://openalex.org/W1589361676,"Galactokinase mRNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated by indirect immunoprecipitation of total yeast polysomes labeled with 32P. This step purified galactokinase-synthesizing polysomes more than 50fold. Polyadenylated mRNA was separated from the other RNA in the immunoprecipitate by affinity chromatography on polyuridylic acid-linked Sepharose. The final mRNA preparation appears to contain 70% pure galactokinase mRNA. This conclusion is supported by the following evidence. 1) Under the conditions employed, 2% of the total polysomes from galactose-induced yeast are immunoprecipitated while only 0.5% of the total polysomes from uninduced cells are immunoprecipitated. 2) The kinetic data of hybridization of the galactokinase mRNA preparation to total yeast DNA are very similar to those expected for a highly purified RNA preparation. 3) Hybridization of galactokinase mRNA to total yeast DNA is blocked by an excess of unlabeled polysomal mRNA from galactose-induced yeast, while, at most, 30% of the hybridization is blocked by larger amounts of unlabeled polysomal mRNA from uninduced yeast. 4) The molecular weight of the galactokinase mRNA preparation, 0.5 to 0.7 x lo’, is consistent with the size of a monocistronic mRNA coding for the galactokinase protein molecule. The low inhibition of hybridization by uninduced RNA suggests that the induction of galactokinase synthesis by galactose is the result of a large increase in the transcription of the galactokinase gene. Since galactokinase comprises only 1.5% of the total induced yeast cell protein, the purification of its message to 70% purity by the use of indirect immunoprecipitation suggests that this technique can be used to purify other eukaryotic mRNAs which comprise between 0.5% and 5% of the total mRNA."

The purified enzyme consisted of identical subunits having molecular weights of about 48,800 which could aggregate to catalytically active isomers of various sizes; however, only one form of the enzyme was detected in freshly prepared homogenates of rat neural tissue. Physical and immunological properties of the enzyme from rat brain were similar to those from superior cervical ganglia and liver. Augmented 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity noted in superior cervical ganglia 2 days after transection of major postganglionic nerve trunks was accompanied by a parallel increase in immunoreactive protein. Michaelis constants of the enzyme were the same in control and axotomized ganglia, and the presence of activators and inhibitors was not detected. It is concluded that increases in 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase subsequent to axotomy can be accounted for entirely by an increase in the steady state concentration of this protein."
