https://openalex.org/W2620662403,"Centrosomes are non-membrane-bound compartments that nucleate microtubule arrays. They consist of nanometer-scale centrioles surrounded by a micron-scale, dynamic assembly of protein called the pericentriolar material (PCM). To study how PCM forms a spherical compartment that nucleates microtubules, we reconstituted PCM-dependent microtubule nucleation in vitro using recombinant C. elegans proteins. We found that macromolecular crowding drives assembly of the key PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 into spherical condensates that morphologically and dynamically resemble in vivo PCM. These SPD-5 condensates recruited the microtubule polymerase ZYG-9 (XMAP215 homolog) and the microtubule-stabilizing protein TPXL-1 (TPX2 homolog). Together, these three proteins concentrated tubulin ∼4-fold over background, which was sufficient to reconstitute nucleation of microtubule asters in vitro. Our results suggest that in vivo PCM is a selective phase that organizes microtubule arrays through localized concentration of tubulin by microtubule effector proteins."

By delivering to the brain multiple electric fields at frequencies too high to recruit neural firing, but which differ by a frequency within the dynamic range of neural firing, we can electrically stimulate neurons throughout a region where interference between the multiple fields results in a prominent electric field envelope modulated at the difference frequency. We validated this temporal interference (TI) concept via modeling and physics experiments, and verified that neurons in the living mouse brain could follow the electric field envelope. We demonstrate the utility of TI stimulation by stimulating neurons in the hippocampus of living mice without recruiting neurons of the overlying cortex. Finally, we show that by altering the currents delivered to a set of immobile electrodes, we can steerably evoke different motor patterns in living mice.

Physical means of brain stimulation, such as the use of implanted electrodes for deep brain stimulation (DBS), have led to widespread excitement about the possibility of repairing neural dysfunction through direct control of brain circuit dynamics, including multiple FDA-approved therapies for previously intractable brain disorders (Greenberg et al., 2010Greenberg B.D. Gabriels L.A. Malone Jr., D.A. Rezai A.R. Friehs G.M. Okun M.S. Shapira N.A. Foote K.D. Cosyns P.R.

Electrical stimulation via implanted electrodes sparsely activates distributed sets of neurons (Histed et al., 2009Histed M.H. Bonin V. Reid R.C. Direct activation of sparse, distributed populations of cortical neurons by electrical microstimulation.Neuron. 2009; 63: 508-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), in a fashion different from direct optogenetic control of local cells (Gradinaru et al., 2009Gradinaru V. Mogri M. Thompson K.R. Henderson J.M. Deisseroth K. Optical deconstruction of parkinsonian neural circuitry.Science. 2009; 324: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). The impact of electromagnetic stimulation on brain circuitry is an emergent function of the fields applied, the excitability properties of the neurons themselves, and the configuration of the neural network in which they are embedded (Merrill et al., 2005Merrill D.R. Bikson M. Jefferys J.G.R. Electrical stimulation of excitable tissue: design of efficacious and safe protocols.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; 141: 171-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). As a result of this complexity, physical means of brain stimulation are often used in a phenomenological way, especially because the excitability properties of neurons vary across different cell types, and thus understanding how a given brain stimulation method impacts a given brain function may require analyzing many factors. However, some properties of neurons are likely universal—for example, the intrinsic low-pass filtering of electrical signals by the neural membrane (Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000Hutcheon B. Yarom Y. Resonance, oscillation and the intrinsic frequency preferences of neurons.Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 216-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), which prevents neural electrical activity from following very high-frequency oscillating (e.g., ≥ 1 kHz) electric fields. Here, we explore whether the biophysics underpinning such a potentially universal property might support novel strategies for electrical brain stimulation. In particular, if we apply high-frequency oscillating electric fields at multiple sites outside the brain, neurons in the brain will not be able to follow these high-frequency fields directly. However, if two such electric fields are applied at high frequencies that differ by a small amount, which corresponds to a low frequency that neurons can follow, neurons in the brain may be able to demodulate and follow the envelope modulation that results from the temporal interference between these two applied fields, and which oscillates at the difference frequency. If the amplitude of the envelope modulation reaches a maximum at a site deep in the brain, it might be possible to drive deep-lying neurons without recruiting overlying ones. We here test this concept, which we call temporal interference (TI) stimulation, by using computational modeling and phantom measurements, as well as electrophysiological measurements in vivo. We demonstrate the ability of TI stimulation to mediate activation of hippocampal neurons without recruiting overlying cortical neurons and steerably probe motor cortex functionality without physically moving electrodes by altering the current magnitudes delivered to a fixed set of electrodes. We first set out to examine whether the TI concept could indeed result in well-defined low-frequency envelope modulated electric fields. In the TI concept (Figure 1A), electric currents are applied at high frequencies f1 and f2 = f1+Δf that fall outside the range of normal neural operation, but which differ by a small amount, Δf, that falls within the frequency range that neurons can respond to. The superposition of the two electric fields inside the brain results in an electric field at a frequency of (f1+f2)/2, whose envelope is modulated at the frequency Δf (Figure 1B). The amplitude of the envelope modulation at a particular location depends on the vectorial sum of the two applied field vectors at that point and as a result can have a maximum at a point distant from the electrodes, potentially even deep in the brain (Figure 1C). The location of this envelope maximum depends on the electrode configuration, as well as properties of the applied waveforms. For the trapezoidal configuration shown in Figure 1A, the low-frequency envelope oscillates at a frequency of 40 Hz, with waveforms in Figure 1B plotted at the two specific points highlighted by Roman numerals in Figure 1A. For example, Figure 1Bi shows a large envelope modulation amplitude at a location where the two fields are large and aligned, whereas Figure 1Bii shows a small envelope modulation amplitude at a location where the two fields are less aligned. To assess whether such low-frequency field envelopes could effectively drive neural spiking activity, we applied TI stimulation transcranially to anesthetized living mice, and recorded the responses by using automated whole-cell patch clamp neural recording. Currents were applied via two electrodes on the skull (with a ∼0.5 mm gap between their edges), and recordings were made in the somatosensory cortex. We found that interferential stimulation with two sinusoids at 2.01 kHz and 2 kHz, resulting in a Δf envelope frequency of 10 Hz, was able to recruit neurons to fire at 10 Hz (Figure 1D), as efficaciously as direct 10 Hz stimulation (Figure 1E) that would be expected to broadly affect neural activity (Miranda et al., 2013Miranda P.C. Mekonnen A. Salvador R. Ruffini G. The electric field in the cortex during transcranial current stimulation.Neuroimage. 2013; 70: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). High-frequency stimulation (with one sinusoid at 2 kHz and no TI) did not result in activity (Figure 1F), beyond a brief transient associated with the beginning of stimulation in some cells (n = 4 out of 6 cells from 2 mice) when 0.25 s sinusoidal ramp-up times were used. When 0.5 s ramp-up times were used, no such transient activity was observed in any cells (n = 5 cells from 2 mice), suggesting that the transient spiking activity observed earlier was due to the speed of the 0.25 s duration ramp-up (Figure 1J). We validated TI stimulation on a population of cortical cells (Figure 1Ii) and found that interferential stimulation with a difference frequency of 10 Hz resulted in spike frequencies of 10.21 ± 0.83 Hz (mean ± SD), for a 1 kHz carrier frequency (n = 6 cells from 2 mice) and 9.68 ± 0.85 Hz for a 2 kHz carrier frequency (n = 7 cells from 3 mice; see Table S1 for full statistics associated with Figure 1Ii). To validate whether neuronal firing can be manipulated at different depths in tissue, we performed automatic patch clamp recording in the mouse hippocampus. Currents were applied via two electrodes that were located on the skull, with proximal edges 1.5–2 mm apart. We found that interferential stimulation (with two sinusoids at 2.01 kHz and 2 kHz, resulting in a Δf envelope frequency of 10 Hz) was able to recruit neural firing in synchronization with the envelope—with either single spikes (n = 3 cells from 2 mice) or brief bursts of spikes (n = 5 cells from 3 mice; a burst was defined as a < 50 ms spiking event with inter-spike interval ≤ 15 ms; 1.3 ± 0.37 mean spikes per burst ± SD; 9.07 ± 3.2 ms inter-spike interval) elicited by the TI stimulation (in detail: mouse 1 had one cell with a burst response; mouse 2 had two cells with single spike responses; mouse 3 had two cells with a burst response; mouse 4 had two cells with a burst response and one cell with a single spike response) (Figure 1G). Direct application of high-frequency stimulation (with two sinusoids on the two electrodes, both at 2 kHz) did not result in activity (Figure 1H). No spiking transient was observed because we used the slower, 0.5 s duration ramp-up that we had previously observed to eliminate this transient (Figure 1J; n = 5 cells from 3 mice). We found (Figure 1Iii) that interferential stimulation with a difference frequency of 10 Hz resulted in spike or burst occurrence frequencies of 10.23 ± 0.61 Hz for a 2 kHz carrier frequency (n = 8 cells from 4 mice; see Table S1 for full statistics associated with Figure 1Iii). The timing of the spikes or the first spikes of bursts, relative to the peak of the TI envelope, was −2.8 ± 4.8 ms, i.e., when the envelope amplitude was >97% of its peak amplitude, which was not different from the timing of spikes evoked by 10 Hz stimulation relative to the 10 Hz sinusoid peak (−1.3 ± 2.2 ms; pairwise t test, p = 0.47). The membrane potential of neurons undergoing TI stimulation repolarized between single spikes, or between brief bursts of spikes, to the baseline membrane potential (cortex, −10.36 ± 27.84 mV, mean difference from baseline ± SD; p = 0.74, pairwise t test; n = 13 cells from 5 mice; hippocampus, 5.5 ± 7.89 mV; p = 0.34; n = 8 cells from 4 mice). The spike frequency during the 20th bout of TI stimulation (tested in three cells in the somatosensory cortex from one mouse; 2 s stimulation followed by 2 s rest) was 9.93 ± 0.2 Hz (mean ± SD), not different from the spike frequency during the 1st bout (p = 0.95; pairwise t test), and the spike amplitude during the 20th bout of TI stimulation was not different from the spike amplitude during the first bout (5.3 ± 3.5 mV, mean amplitude difference ± SD; p = 0.75, pairwise t test); see Figures S1L–S1N for representative traces. The membrane potential of neurons undergoing high-frequency stimulation (with two sinusoids on the two electrodes, both at 2 kHz or at 1 kHz) in both the cortex and the hippocampus was not different from the baseline membrane potential before the stimulation (cortex, 1.67 ± 4.87 mV, mean difference from baseline ± SD, measured 1 s after stimulation onset; p = 0.66, pairwise t test; n = 11 cells from 5 mice; hippocampus, −1.7 ± 5.39 mV; p = 0.91; n = 5 cells from 3 mice). To explore the effects of interferential stimulation at a physics level, we modeled the interferential electric field envelope magnitude as in Figure 1A but for a variety of electrode configurations, and we also experimentally assessed these fields by using a tissue phantom comprising a plastic cylinder filled with saline (Figure S2). Current sources were isolated in the circuitry as described in Figure S3. We found that by altering the locations of the electrodes and by setting the currents appropriately, we could enable the interferential envelope modulation to be targeted to specific locations. For example, when the electrodes were arranged in a trapezoidal geometry as in Figure 1A, but with a narrow base, we obtained, both in simulation and in the phantom, a peak of envelope modulation near the surface of the cylinder, at a point in between the two electrodes (Figure 2A), when both electrode pairs were conducting equal currents (1 mA in this example). By moving the electrodes that comprise the narrow base of the trapezoid further and further apart from each other, holding the currents constant, we could steer the location of the peak envelope modulation deeper into the tissue (Figure 2B), approaching the center of the cylinder as the trapezoid converged to a rectangle (Figure 2C). The envelope locus (i.e., distance out to 1/e of the envelope maximum) in Figure 2C was approximately two times larger, and the peak envelope amplitude ten times weaker, than in Figure 2A (see Table 1 for numerical values associated with these three panels). Thus, it is possible to steer the envelope peak to have its maximum at essentially any depth throughout a volume, albeit with a tradeoff between the locus depth and its width and strength. Varying the locations of electrodes causes large changes in steering, with electrode size variation playing a more minor role (Figures S2A–S2C). These analyses were conducted with a cylindrical phantom, but similar field distributions were obtained in simulations with a spherical phantom (Figures S2G–S2L).Figure S3Design, Implementation, and Characterization of TI Stimulator, Related to Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and STAR MethodsShow full captionStimulating currents were generated using a custom device consisting of two electrically isolated current sources. To isolate the channels, each waveform was supplied via a balanced pair of current sources that were driven in precisely opposite phase, a technique that we call anti-phasic current drive.(A) Schematics of the electronic circuitry of the stimulator. (i) Dual channel stimulation with anti-phasic current drive isolation. In channel 1 (CH1), a voltage waveform V1 at a frequency f1 was applied to the positive (+) input of a voltage-controlled current source (J1) that had its negative (−) input grounded, resulting in a current waveform I1 at node 1A that was in-phase with waveform V1. An equal voltage waveform V1 at a frequency f1 was applied to the negative (−) input of a second voltage-controlled current source (J2) that had its positive (+) input grounded, resulting in a current waveform −I1 at node 1B that is anti-phase with waveform V1. In channel 2 (CH2), a second voltage waveform V2 at a frequency f2 was converted in an equivalent way to an in-phase current waveform I2 at node 2A by a voltage-controlled current source (J3) and to an anti-phase current waveform −I2 at node 2B by a voltage-controlled current source (J4). The amplitude of current I1 of CH1 between nodes 1A and 1B was calibrated such that I1(A)=(V1(V)/500) and the amplitude of current I2 of CH2 between nodes 2A and 2B was calibrated such that I2(A)=(V2(V)/500). A ground or reference electrode (Ref) was provided to carry any imbalance currents from the paired current sources and to prevent charging of the body relative to earth ground. (ii) Dual channel stimulation without isolation. As in (i), but nodes 1B and 2B were connected to the GND of the device.(B) Characterization of channel isolation. (i) Schematic of the experiment setup. Voltage waveform V1 of CH1 was set to 1 kHz and 0.5 V resulting in a current I1 between nodes 1A and 1B at the same frequency and an amplitude of 1 mA. The output nodes 1A and 1B were connected to a load made of a bridge of 6 resistors with 1 kΩ resistance each. Voltage waveform V2 of CH2 was set to 1.1 kHz and 0.5 V resulting in a current I2 between nodes 2A and 2B at the same frequency and an amplitude of 1 mA. The output nodes 2A and 2B were connected to the same resistor bridge load as shown in the schematics. The frequency spectrum of the currents was measured using a FFT spectrum analyzer (SR770, Stanford Research) at the output of CH1 between nodes 1A and 1B, the output of CH2 between nodes 2A and 2B, and across the resistor bridge between nodes 1A and 2B. (ii) Ratio of the FFT amplitude at the cross-talk frequency (i.e., f2 at the output nodes 1A and 1B of CH1 and f1 at the output nodes 2A and 2B of CH2) and the FFT amplitude at the channel’s set frequency (i.e., f1 at the output nodes 1A and 1B of CH1 and f2 at the output nodes 2A and 2B of CH2). FFT ratio across CH1−CH2 between the output node 1A of CH1 and the output node 2B of CH2 is the ratio of the FFT amplitude of f1 and the FFT amplitude of f2. (The total harmonic distortion of the current source was < 0.08% at 100 Hz and < 0.4% at 10 kHz, measured with 9 harmonics on 1 kΩ load resistor.)(C) Characterization of output current for different load resistances. Voltage waveform V1 of CH1 was set to 1kHz and 0.5 V resulting in a current I1 between nodes 1A and 1B of the same frequency and an amplitude of 1 mA. The output nodes 1A and 1B were connected to loads with resistances between 100 Ω and 100 kΩ. The output nodes 2A and 2B of CH2 were grounded. The current flowing between nodes 1A and 1B was measured using a digital ammeter. The panel shows the amplitude of the measured currents Imeasured in mA against the load resistance in Ω.(D) Characterization of output current for different set frequencies. Voltage waveform V1 of CH1 was set to a range of frequencies between 0.1 Hz and 50 kHz with a range of amplitudes between 0.5 mV and 0.5 V, resulting in a current I1 between 1A and 1B nodes of the same frequencies and with amplitudes that ranged between 1 μA and 1 mA. The output nodes 1A and 1B were connected to a load with a resistance of 10 kΩ. The output nodes 2A and 2B of CH2 were grounded. The current flowing between nodes 1A and 1B was measured using a digital ammeter. The panel shows 7 line plots of the RMS amplitude of the measured currents Imeasured(RMS) in μA against the RMS amplitude of the current that was programmed in the device Iprogrammed(RMS) in μA, where Iprogrammed(RMS)=(I1/2)=(V1(V)/2⋅500), for frequencies 0.1 Hz, 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 100 Hz, 1kHz, 10 kHz and 50 kHz. (Note that the line plots of frequencies between 0.1 Hz and 10 kHz are overlapping).(E and F) Effect of channel isolation on distribution of envelope amplitude. An alternating current I1 was applied to a phantom at a frequency of 1 kHz via one pair of electrodes (gray). A second alternating current I2 was applied to the phantom at a frequency of 1.02 kHz via a second pair of electrodes (black). The phantom was a non-conductive cylinder of 50 mm diameter and 10 mm height that was filled with a saline solution. The two pairs of electrodes (gray and black) were placed in an isosceles trapezoid geometry such that each electrode pair was located at the vertices of one lateral side. The trapezoid had a normalized small base size of a = 1.39 and a normalized large base size of b = 1.96. The amplitudes of currents I1 and I2 were 1 mA. The envelope modulation amplitude from temporal interference of two electric fields projected along the xˆ and yˆ directions was measured using a lock-in amplifier as in Figure 2 (see also STAR Methods for a detailed description of the phantom measurement). Envelope modulation amplitude maps are a linear interpolation (interpolation factor 2) between the measured values. Color-maps show values normalized to maximal envelope modulation amplitude. Distances were normalized to the phantom’s radius and are shown relative to the center of the phantom. High isolation is required between the two current sources in order to focus the region with large envelope modulation amplitude deep into the phantom.(E) Envelope modulation amplitude maps when currents were applied with a high level of electrical isolation between the current sources. (i) Envelope modulation amplitude map |EAMxˆ(x,y)| along xˆ direction; (ii) envelope modulation amplitude map |EAMyˆ(x,y)| (projection along yˆ direction). Dashed lines cross at the peak of the envelope modulation amplitude distribution, i.e., |EAMxˆ|max and |EAMyˆ|max. The volume of large envelope modulation amplitude was located along the midline of trapezoid at its small base with a peak at x = 0 and y = 0.49. The spread of |EAMxˆ| around its peak has a normalized half width at half maximum along the xˆ direction HWHMxˆ=0.46 and a normalized half width at half maximum along the yˆ direction HWHMyˆ=0.46. The spread of |EAMyˆ| around its peak is HWHMxˆ=0.51 and HWHMyˆ=0.95.(F) Same as (E) but when currents were applied without electrical isolation between the current sources. The peak of the envelope modulation amplitude was located along the midline of the trapezoid at its small base as in (E) however the distribution of the envelope modulation amplitude was significantly more dispersed. The amplitude of |EAMxˆ| at the end of the xˆ direction dashed line (normalized distance of 0.51 from center) was 0.76 of its maximal value. The spread of |EAMxˆ| around its maximal value had a normalized HWHMxˆ=0.95. The amplitude of |EAMyˆ| at the end of the yˆ direction dashed line was 0.91 of its maximal value. The spread of |EAMyˆ| around its maximal value had a normalized HWHMyˆ=0.83.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Steerability of TI, Probed via Both Computational Modeling and a Tissue PhantomShow full captionFor each condition (A)–(E), we simulated the interferential electric field envelope modulation (projected along: i, x-direction, ii, y-direction) that would result from electrodes at the locations indicated by the rectangles (the gray electrodes forming a pair, with an alternating current I1 applied at 1 kHz, and the black electrodes forming a second pair, with an alternating current I2 applied at 1.02 kHz), passing the currents described below in the individual panel caption sections.

(A) Schematics of the electronic circuitry of the stimulator. (i) Dual channel stimulation with anti-phasic current drive isolation. In channel 1 (CH1), a voltage waveform V1 at a frequency f1 was applied to the positive (+) input of a voltage-controlled current source (J1) that had its negative (−) input grounded, resulting in a current waveform I1 at node 1A that was in-phase with waveform V1. An equal voltage waveform V1 at a frequency f1 was applied to the negative (−) input of a second voltage-controlled current source (J2) that had its positive (+) input grounded, resulting in a current waveform −I1 at node 1B that is anti-phase with waveform V1. In channel 2 (CH2), a second voltage waveform V2 at a frequency f2 was converted in an equivalent way to an in-phase current waveform I2 at node 2A by a voltage-controlled current source (J3) and to an anti-phase current waveform −I2 at node 2B by a voltage-controlled current source (J4). The amplitude of current I1 of CH1 between nodes 1A and 1B was calibrated such that I1(A)=(V1(V)/500) and the amplitude of current I2 of CH2 between nodes 2A and 2B was calibrated such that I2(A)=(V2(V)/500). A ground or reference electrode (Ref) was provided to carry any imbalance currents from the paired current sources and to prevent charging of the body relative to earth ground.

https://openalex.org/W2621150162,"•Facial images can be linearly reconstructed using responses of ∼200 face cells•Face cells display flat tuning along dimensions orthogonal to the axis being coded•The axis model is more efficient, robust, and flexible than the exemplar model•Face patches ML/MF and AM carry complementary information about faces Primates recognize complex objects such as faces with remarkable speed and reliability. Here, we reveal the brain’s code for facial identity. Experiments in macaques demonstrate an extraordinarily simple transformation between faces and responses of cells in face patches. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, we discovered that each face cell’s firing rate is proportional to the projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a face cell ensemble to encode the location of any face in the space. Using this code, we could precisely decode faces from neural population responses and predict neural firing rates to faces. Furthermore, this code disavows the long-standing assumption that face cells encode specific facial identities, confirmed by engineering faces with drastically different appearance that elicited identical responses in single face cells.

Here, we reveal the brain’s code for facial identity. Experiments in macaques demonstrate an extraordinarily simple transformation between faces and responses of cells in face patches. By formatting faces as points in a high-dimensional linear space, we discovered that each face cell’s firing rate is proportional to the projection of an incoming face stimulus onto a single axis in this space, allowing a face cell ensemble to encode the location of any face in the space. Using this code, we could precisely decode faces from neural population responses and predict neural firing rates to faces. Furthermore, this code disavows the long-standing assumption that face cells encode specific facial identities, confirmed by engineering faces with drastically different appearance that elicited identical responses in single face cells. Our work suggests that other objects could be encoded by analogous metric coordinate systems. A central challenge of visual neuroscience is to understand how the brain represents the identity of a complex object. This process is thought to happen in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, where neurons carry information about high-level object identity, with invariance to various transformations that do not affect identity (Brincat and Connor, 2004Brincat S.L. Connor C.E. Underlying principles of visual shape selectivity in posterior inferotemporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Ito et al., 1995Ito M.

However, despite decades of research on the response properties of IT neurons, the precise code for object identity used by single IT neurons remains unknown: typically, neurons respond to a broad range of stimuli, and the principles governing the set of effective stimuli are not understood. Ideally, if we had a full understanding of IT cortex, then we would be able to decode the precise object presented from IT population responses and conversely predict IT responses to an arbitrary object. Due to the many layers of computation between the retina and IT cortex, it has been suggested that a simple, explicit model of IT cells may be impossible to achieve (Yamins et al., 2014Yamins D.L. Hong H. Cadieu C.F. Solomon E.A. Seibert D. DiCarlo J.J. Performance-optimized hierarchical models predict neural responses in higher visual cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 8619-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to construct an explicit model of face-selective cells that would allow us to both decode an arbitrary realistic face from face cell responses and predict the firing of cells in response to an arbitrary realistic face. Studying face coding has two unique advantages. First, the macaque face patch system, a set of regions strongly selective for faces in fMRI experiments, provides a powerful experimental model to dissect the mechanism for face representation, since these regions contain high concentrations of face-selective cells (Tsao et al., 2006Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Tootell R.B. Livingstone M.S. A cortical region consisting entirely of face-selective cells.Science. 2006; 311: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and appear to perform distinct steps in face representation (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y. Functional compartmentalization and viewpoint generalization within the macaque face-processing system.Science. 2010; 330: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Second, the homogeneity of faces as a stimulus class permits arbitrary faces to be represented by relatively small sets of numbers describing coordinates within a “face space” (Beymer and Poggio, 1996Beymer D. Poggio T. Image representations for visual learning.Science. 1996; 272: 1905-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Blanz and Vetter, 1999Blanz, V., and Vetter, T. (1999).

Interpreting face images using active appearance models. Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition - Third IEEE International Conference Proceedings, 300–305.Google Scholar), facilitating systematic exploration of the full geometry of neuronal tuning. To explore the geometry of tuning of high-level sensory neurons in a high-dimensional space, we recorded responses of cells in face patches middle lateral (ML)/middle fundus (MF) and anterior medial (AM) to a large set of realistic faces parameterized by 50 dimensions. We chose to record in ML/MF and AM because previous functional (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y. Functional compartmentalization and viewpoint generalization within the macaque face-processing system.Science. 2010; 330: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and anatomical (Grimaldi et al., 2016Grimaldi P. Saleem K.S. Tsao D. Anatomical connections of the functionally-defined “face patches” in the macaque monkey.Neuron. 2016; 90: 1325-1342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar; S. Moeller et al., 2008, Soc. Neurosci., abstract) experiments have demonstrated a hierarchical relationship between ML/MF and AM and suggest that AM is the final output stage of IT face processing. In particular, a population of sparse cells has been found in AM, which appear to encode exemplars for specific individuals, as they respond to faces of only a few specific individuals, regardless of head orientation (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y. Functional compartmentalization and viewpoint generalization within the macaque face-processing system.Science. 2010; 330: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). These cells encode the most explicit concept of facial identity across the entire face patch system, and understanding them seems crucial for gaining a full understanding of the neural code for faces in IT cortex. Our data reveal a remarkably simple code for facial identity in face patches ML/MF and AM that can be used to both precisely decode realistic face images from population responses and accurately predict neural firing rates. Single cells in both ML/MF and AM are essentially projecting incoming faces, represented as vectors in face space, onto specific axes. A prediction of this model is that each cell should have a linear null space, orthogonal to the preferred axis, in which all faces elicit the same response. We confirm this prediction, even for sparse AM cells that had previously been assumed to explicitly code exemplars of specific identities. We first localized six face patches in two monkeys with fMRI by presenting a face localizer stimulus set containing images of faces and non-face objects (Moeller et al., 2008Moeller S. Freiwald W.A.

USA. 2008; 105: 19514-19519Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Middle face patches MF, ML, and anterior patch AM were targeted for electrophysiological recordings (Tsao et al., 2006Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Tootell R.B. Livingstone M.S. A cortical region consisting entirely of face-selective cells.Science. 2006; 311: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). Well-isolated single units were recorded while presenting 16 real faces and 80 non-face objects (same stimuli as in Tsao et al., 2006Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Tootell R.B. Livingstone M.S. A cortical region consisting entirely of face-selective cells.Science. 2006; 311: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Units selective for faces were selected for further recordings (Figures S1B and S1C; see STAR Methods). To investigate face representation in face patches, we generated parameterized realistic face stimuli using the “active appearance model” (Cootes et al., 2001Cootes T.F. Edwards G.J. Taylor C.J. Active appearance models.IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 2001; 23: 681-685Crossref Scopus (4015) Google Scholar, Edwards et al., 1998Edwards, G.J., Taylor, C.J., and Cootes, T.F. (1998). Interpreting face images using active appearance models. Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition - Third IEEE International Conference Proceedings, 300–305.Google Scholar): for each of 200 frontal faces from an online face database (FEI face database; see STAR Methods: Generation of parameterized face stimuli), a set of landmarks were labeled by hand (Figure 1A, left). The positions of these points carry information about the shape of the face and the shape/position of internal features (Figure 1A, middle). Then the landmarks were smoothly morphed to a standard template (average shape of landmarks); the resulting image (Figure 1A, right) carries shape-free appearance information. In this way, we extracted a set of 200 shape descriptors and 200 appearance descriptors. To construct a realistic face space, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) on the shape and appearance descriptors separately, to extract the feature dimensions that accounted for the largest variability in the database, retaining the first 25 PCs for shape and first 25 PCs for appearance (Figures 1B and S2A). This results in a 50-dimensional (50-d) face space, where every point represents a face, obtained by starting with the average face, first adding the appearance transform and then applying the shape transform to the landmarks; reconstructions of faces from the original dataset within this 50-d space strongly resemble the original faces (Figure S2B). Most of the dimensions were “holistic,” involving changes in multiple parts of the face; for example, the first shape dimension involved changes in hairline, face width, and height of eyes. Movie S1 shows a movie of a face undergoing changes only in shape parameters and a face undergoing changes only in appearance parameters.Figure S2Feature Dimensions of Parameterized Face Stimuli, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Frontal faces corresponding to the first 3 PCs for shape (top) and first 3 PCs for shape-free appearance (bottom).(B) Original faces from the database are shown alongside reconstructions based on their feature values in the 50-d space.(C) (C1) Gray lines show distribution of feature values of 200 real faces along 50 dimensions, normalized to zero mean and unit variance.

The intensity was normalized so that 0 was mapped to middle gray, and maximum absolute value was mapped to black or white. To generate stimuli for our recordings, we randomly drew 2,000 faces from this face space (Figure 1C). Projections of real faces onto the 50 axes were largely Gaussian, and the 2,000 faces shared a similar distribution of vector lengths as the real faces (Figure S2C). Face stimuli were presented for 150 ms (ON period) interleaved by a gray screen for 150 ms (OFF period), and the same set of 2,000 stimuli were presented to each cell from three to five times each. We recorded 205 cells in total from two monkeys: 51 cells from ML/MF and 64 cells from AM for monkey 1; 55 cells from ML/MF, and 35 cells from AM for monkey 2. To quantify neuronal tuning to the 50 dimensions of the face space, responses of each neuron were first used to calculate a “spike-triggered average” (STA) stimulus (Schwartz et al., 2006Schwartz O. Pillow J.W. Rust N.C. Simoncelli E.P. Spike-triggered neural characterization.J. Vis. 2006; 6: 484-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), i.e., the average stimulus that triggered the neuron to fire (Figure 1D). On average, each cell was significantly tuned along 6.1 feature dimensions (covering the range [0 17] with SD = 3.8). We next compared the relative sensitivity to shape or appearance for each neuron: a “shape preference index” was computed based on the vector length of the STA for shape versus appearance dimensions. We found that most ML/MF cells showed stronger tuning to shape dimensions than to appearance dimensions, while AM cells showed the opposite trend (Figures 1E–1H). The shape preference indices computed with subsets of stimuli were highly correlated (split halves approach, correlation = 0.89 ± 0.07, n = 205 cells, see STAR Methods); hence, this distinction between preferred axes in ML/MF and AM is real (Figure 1G). Furthermore, this distinction is completely consistent with previous studies showing that ML/MF cells are tuned to specific face views, while AM cells code view-invariant identity (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y. Functional compartmentalization and viewpoint generalization within the macaque face-processing system.Science. 2010; 330: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Changes in identity would produce changes in appearance dimensions, and changes in view (within a limited range away from frontal) would be accounted for by changes in shape dimensions. Importantly, because shape dimensions encompass a much larger set of transformations than just view changes, the tuning of AM cells to appearance dimensions indicates invariance to a much larger set of transformations in articulated shape than just view changes, consistent with the invariance of face recognition behavior to many transformations beyond view changes, such as severe distortion in face aspect ratio (Sinha et al., 2006Sinha P. Balas B. Ostrovsky Y. Russell R. Face recognition by humans: Nineteen results all computer vision researchers should know about.P. IEEE. 2006; 94: 1948-1962Crossref Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Next, we explored the shape of tuning to shape/appearance dimensions by ML/MF and AM neurons. When responses of an example AM neuron were grouped according to the distance between the stimulus and the average face (i.e., the face at the origin of the face space) along the STA axis in the 50-d face space, we saw ramp-like tuning, with maximum and minimum responses occurring at extreme feature values (Figure 1I). Such ramp-like tuning was consistently observed along the STA dimension across the population for both AM and ML/MF (Figure 1J) and was also clear for individual dimensions (Figure 1K). If a face cell has ramp-shaped tuning to different features, this means that its response can be roughly approximated by a linear combination of the facial features, with the weighting coefficients given by the slopes of the ramp-shaped tuning functions. For a population of neurons, R→=S⋅F→+C→, where R→ is the vector of responses of different neurons, S is the matrix of weighting coefficients for different neurons, F→ is the 50-d vector of face feature values, and C→ is the offset vector. If this is true, then by simply inverting this equation, we should be able to linearly decode the facial features from the population response (Cowen et al., 2014Cowen A.S. Chun M.M. Kuhl B.A. Neural portraits of perception: Reconstructing face images from evoked brain activity.Neuroimage. 2014; 94: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Kay et al., 2008Kay K.N.

USA. 2016; 113: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To attempt this, we took advantage of the fact that we always presented the same set of 2,000 stimuli to the monkey and used a leave-one-out approach to train and test our model. We determined the transformation from responses to feature values with linear regression using population responses of face cells in a time window from 50 to 300 ms after stimulus onset to 1,999 faces and then predicted the feature value of the remaining image (Figure 2A). Note that, for this decoding procedure, we used cells recorded sequentially; if the brain were to use a similar decoding approach, it would be using neurons firing simultaneously. We found this simple linear model could predict single features very well (Figure 2B). We used percentage variance of the feature values explained by the linear model to quantify the decoding quality. Overall, the decoding quality for appearance features was better than that for shape features for AM neurons, while the opposite was true for ML/MF neurons (Figures 2C and 2D), consistent with our analysis using STA (Figure 1F). By combining the predicted feature values across all 50 dimensions, we could reconstruct the face that the monkey saw. Examples of the reconstructed faces are shown in Figure 3A next to the actual faces, using ML/MF data, AM data, and combined data from both patches. The reconstructions using AM data strongly resemble the actual faces the monkey saw, and the resemblance was further improved by adding ML/MF data. To quantify the overall decoding accuracy of our model, we randomly selected a number of faces from the stimulus set and compared their actual 50-d feature vectors to the reconstructed feature vector of one face in the set using Euclidean distance. The decoding accuracy decayed with increasing number of faces but was ∼75% with 40 faces when all cells were pooled together (Figure 3B, black solid line), which is much higher than chance level (Figure 3B black dashed line). Furthermore, when the number of cells was equalized, decoding accuracy rose fastest for the combined population compared to ML/MF and AM populations alone (Figure 3C, for n = 99 cells, p < 0.01 when comparing combined population with AM; p < 0.005 when comparing combined population with ML/MF, estimated by 1,000 iterations of random sampling with replacement, see STAR Methods), consistent with the two regions carrying complementary information about shape and appearance. We also determined the accuracy of decoding by measuring the subjective similarity between the reconstructions and actual faces using human psychophysics and found that human subjects were significantly more likely to match the reconstructed with the actual face, compared to a highly similar distractor (see STAR Methods: Human psychophysics). The fact that we can accurately decode the identity of real faces from population responses in ML/MF and AM shows that we have satisfied one essential test of a full understanding of the brain’s code for face identity. The model used for decoding assumes that face patch neurons are linearly combining different features (“axis model”). While simple, this code is inconsistent with prevailing notions of the function of IT cells, in particular, sparse AM cells. Many models of object recognition assume an exemplar-based representation (Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999Riesenhuber M. Poggio T. Hierarchical models of object recognition in cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar, Valentine, 1991Valentine T. A unified account of the effects of distinctiveness, inversion, and race in face recognition.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. A. 1991; 43: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar) (Figure 4G, right), in which object recognition is mediated by units tuned to exemplars of specific objects that need to be recognized. Early studies attempting to find the “optimal object” for IT cells assumed such an exemplar-based model (Tanaka, 1996Tanaka K. Inferotemporal cortex and object vision.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). More direct support for an exemplar-based model comes from recordings in face patch AM, where a subset of cells have been found to respond extremely sparsely to only a few identities, invariant to head orientation (e.g., see Figure 1 in Freiwald and Tsao, 2010Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y. Functional compartmentalization and viewpoint generalization within the macaque face-processing system.Science. 2010; 330: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar and Movie S2). These cells have been hypothesized to code exemplars of specific individuals, analogous to the “Jennifer Aniston” cells recorded in human hippocampus that respond to images, letter strings, and vocalizations of one specific individual (Quiroga et al., 2005Quiroga R.Q. Reddy L. Kreiman G. Koch C. Fried I. Invariant visual representation by single neurons in the human brain.Nature. 2005; 435: 1102-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). If AM cells are in fact linearly combining different features, then geometrically what an AM cell is doing is simply taking a dot product between an incoming face and a specific direction in face space defined by the cell’s STA (Figure 4A, inset). If this is true, then each cell should have a null space within which the response of the cell does not change. This null space is simply the plane orthogonal to the STA, since adding a vector in this plane will not change the value of projection onto the STA. In contrast, if AM cells are coding exemplars of specific individuals, then the response to an incoming face should be a decreasing function of distance of the face to the exemplar face (Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999Riesenhuber M. Poggio T. Hierarchical models of object recognition in cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar, Valentine, 1991Valentine T. A unified account of the effects of distinctiveness, inversion, and race in face recognition.Q. J. Exp. Psychol. A. 1991; 43: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). To decide whether a cell is coding an exemplar or an axis, the critical question is, what is the shape of tuning along axes in the plane orthogonal to the STA axis? If this plane constitutes a “null space” in which all faces elicit the same response, this would be indicative of axis coding. Alternatively, if there is Gaussian tuning along axes within this plane, this would be indicative of exemplar coding. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we quantified tuning of AM cells along axes orthogonal to the STA in 25-d appearance feature space (Figure 4A); we purposely excluded the 25-d shape feature space to avoid the possibility of shape invariance giving rise to flat tuning along the orthogonal dimension. To obtain better signal quality, we averaged tuning along multiple axes that accounted for the largest variability of the stimuli (see STAR Methods; the results also hold true for single axes, see Figure S3). Surprisingly, the tuning of AM neurons was largely flat along orthogonal axes and showed no clear bias for Gaussian nonlinearity. To quantitatively confirm the flatness, we compared the result with several models (Figures 4B and S3B–S3D). The first model defined, for each AM cell recorded, a counterpart model “exemplar” cell that fired maximally to a specific exemplar face, and whose firing rate decayed linearly as a function of the distance between an incoming face and the exemplar face. We chose the exemplar face by projecting one of the 200 real faces in the original FEI database to the 25-d appearance feature space. The sparseness and noise of the model units were set equal to those of the actual units. As expected, the model units displayed clear bell-shaped tuning along orthogonal axes (Figure 4B1). In a second exemplar model, we implemented view invariance by a conventional max-pooling operation: each unit contained a set of templates corresponding to different views and positions of the same identity, and the response of the unit to one face was the maximum of the similarities between this face and each template (similarity was defined as a decreasing linear function of mean absolute pixel difference between two images). This model also demonstrated a clear bell-shaped nonlinearity (Figure 4B2). One might worry that the flat tuning we observed in the orthogonal plane was due to contribution from dimensions that did not modulate any cells in the population; analysis of responses restricted to the actual face space spanned by the STAs of AM neurons shows that this is not the case (Figures S4A–S4H). Another concern is that cells may encode exemplars using an ellipsoidal distance metric, such that tuning is broader along some dimensions than others; analysis of model exemplar units explicitly endowed with non-circular aspect ratio rule out this possibility (Figures S4I–S4L). A further potential confounding factor is adaptation: cells in IT cortex have been reported to suppress their responses more strongly for more frequent feature values (Vogels, 2016Vogels R. Sources of adaptation of inferior temporal cortical responses.Cortex. 2016; 80: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our stimuli were Gaussian distributed along each axis; as a result, faces closer to the average appeared more frequently. To rule out the possibility that our findings are specific to our stimulus conditions, we examined the extent of adaptation in the recorded cells by regrouping the responses based on the preceding stimuli. We first examined how tuning along the STA dimension is affected by the preceding stimuli. The responses of each cell were regrouped according to the distance between the immediately preceding stimulus and the average face along the STA dimension, into a far group (33% largest distances) and a near group (33% smallest distances). If adaptation plays an important role, one would expect to see a clear difference in tuning between the two groups (for example, one might expect the center of the tuning function to be more suppressed for the “near” group than the “far” group). However, we observed no difference in tuning between the two groups (Figures S5A–S5D). Similar to results along the STA dimension, we found adaptation played little role in reshaping tuning along orthogonal axes"

To investigate such protein interactions, we establish a ribosome affinity purification method that unexpectedly identifies hundreds of ribosome-associated proteins (RAPs) from categories including metabolism and cell cycle, as well as RNA- and protein-modifying enzymes that functionally diversify mammalian ribosomes. By further characterizing RAPs, we discover the presence of ufmylation, a metazoan-specific post-translational modification (PTM), on ribosomes and define its direct substrates. Moreover, we show that the metabolic enzyme, pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM), interacts with sub-pools of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ribosomes, exerting a non-canonical function as an RNA-binding protein in the translation of ER-destined mRNAs. Therefore, RAPs interconnect one of life's most ancient molecular machines with diverse cellular processes, providing an additional layer of regulatory potential to protein expression."

The conformation corresponds to an “uncoupled,” PIP2-free state of KCNQ1, with activated voltage sensors and a closed pore. Unique structural features within the S4-S5 linker permit uncoupling of the voltage sensor from the pore in the absence of PIP2. CaM contacts the KCNQ1 voltage sensor through a specific interface involving a residue on CaM that is mutated in a form of inherited LQTS. Using an electrophysiological assay, we find that this mutation on CaM shifts the KCNQ1 voltage-activation curve. This study describes one physiological form of KCNQ1, depolarized voltage sensors with a closed pore in the absence of PIP2, and reveals a regulatory interaction between CaM and KCNQ1 that may explain CaM-mediated LQTS."
https://openalex.org/W2620755219,"Proteolytic degradation of peptide-based drugs is often considered as major weakness limiting systemic therapeutic applications. Therefore, huge efforts are typically devoted to stabilize sequences against proteases present in serum or plasma, obtained as supernatants after complete blood coagulation or centrifugation of blood supplemented with anticoagulants, respectively. Plasma and serum are reproducibly obtained from animals and humans allowing consistent for clinical analyses and research applications. However, the spectrum of active or activated proteases appears to vary depending on the activation of proteases and cofactors during coagulation (serum) or inhibition of such enzymes by anticoagulants (plasma), such as EDTA (metallo- and Ca2+-dependent proteases) and heparin (e.g. thrombin, factor Xa). Here, we studied the presumed effects on peptide degradation by taking blood via cardiac puncture of CD-1 mice using a syringe containing a peptide solution. Due to absence of coagulation activators (e.g. glass surfaces and damaged cells), visible blood clotting was prevented allowing to study peptide degradation for one hour. The remaining peptide was quantified and the degradation products were identified using mass spectrometry. When the degradation rates (half-life times) were compared to serum derived freshly from the same animal and commercial serum and plasma samples, peptides of three different families showed indeed considerably different stabilities. Generally, peptides were faster degraded in serum than in plasma, but surprisingly all peptides were more stable in fresh blood and the order of degradation rates among the peptides varied among the six different incubation experiments. This indicates, that proteolytic degradation of peptide-based therapeutics may often be misleading stimulating efforts to stabilize peptides at degradation sites relevant only in vitro, i.e., for serum or plasma stability assays, but of lower importance in vivo."

Heterozygous BRCA2 truncations, by lowering pre-existing BRCA2 expression, sensitize to BRCA2 haploinsufficiency induced by transient exposure to natural concentrations of formaldehyde. Acetaldehyde, an alcohol catabolite detoxified by ALDH2, precipitates similar effects. Ribonuclease H1 ameliorates replication fork instability and chromosomal aberrations provoked by aldehyde-induced BRCA2 haploinsufficiency, suggesting that BRCA2 inactivation triggers spontaneous mutagenesis during DNA replication via aberrant RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops). These findings suggest a model wherein carcinogenesis in BRCA2 mutation carriers can be incited by compounds found pervasively in the environment and generated endogenously in certain tissues with implications for public health."
https://openalex.org/W2623012790,"How does experience inform decisions? In episodic sampling, decisions are guided by a few episodic memories of past choices. This process can yield choice patterns similar to model-free reinforcement learning; however, samples can vary from trial to trial, causing decisions to vary. Here we show that context retrieved during episodic sampling can cause choice behavior to deviate sharply from the predictions of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we show that, when a given memory is sampled, choices (in the present) are influenced by the properties of other decisions made in the same context as the sampled event. This effect is mediated by fMRI measures of context retrieval on each trial, suggesting a mechanism whereby cues trigger retrieval of context, which then triggers retrieval of other decisions from that context. This result establishes a new avenue by which experience can guide choice and, as such, has broad implications for the study of decisions."

Classically, the NLRP3 inflammasome in murine macrophages is activated by the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and by many structurally unrelated factors. Understanding the precise mechanism of NLRP3 activation by such a wide array of stimuli remains elusive, but several signaling events, including cytosolic efflux and influx of select ions, have been suggested.

Here, we report that the chloride intracellular channel proteins CLIC1 and CLIC4 participate in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Confocal microscopy and cell fractionation experiments revealed that upon LPS stimulation of macrophages, CLIC1 and CLIC4 translocated into the nucleus and cellular membrane. In LPS/ATP-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), CLIC1 or CLIC4 siRNA transfection impaired transcription of IL-1β, ASC speck formation, and secretion of mature IL-1β.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1β) is a central proinflammatory cytokine that plays a critical role in the innate immunity and inflammation (1van der Meer J.W. Barza M. Wolff S.M. Dinarello C.A.

Induction of IL-1β is tightly regulated by the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that upon recognition of a large number of inflammatory factors mediates activation of caspase-1, which processes pro-IL-1β and IL-18 into their mature active forms and also causes a type of cell death called pyroptosis (4Bergsbaken T.

Several inflammasome complexes have been described to date; however, the NLRP3 inflammasome is of special interest because of its ability to recognize a wide range of noxious substances. Importantly, dysregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is recognized as the common feature of a wide spectrum of chronic inflammatory and metabolic diseases, such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type-2 diabetes, and obesity (6Denoble A.E.

Toll-like receptors and NLRP3 as central regulators of pancreatic islet inflammation in type 2 diabetes.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2014; 92: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The classical activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in murine macrophages requires two distinct signals. Signal 1, also called priming, involves the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as the Gram-negative bacterial product LPS, by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which leads to the increased expression of pro-IL1β and NLRP3 (15Mariathasan S.

Cryopyrin activates the inflammasome in response to toxins and ATP.Nature. 2006; 440: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar). The second signal is triggered by the recognition of a myriad of structurally unrelated factors including endogenous markers of cellular and metabolic distress such as monosodium urate (MSU), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), amyloid-β, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), exogenous agents such as asbestos, silica or alum, and obesity-related factors such as ceramide or fatty acids (16Duncan J.A.

All of these factors lead to the activation and assembly of the inflammasome complex. Understanding of the precise mechanism of NLRP3 activation by such a wide array of stimuli remains elusive, but to date several signaling events have been suggested to induce NLRP3 activation. These include cytosolic efflux of K+ (20Muñoz-Planillo R. Kuffa P. Martínez-Colón G. Smith B.L. Rajendiran T.M. Núñez G. K+ efflux is the common trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by bacterial toxins and particulate matter.Immunity. 2013; 38: 1142-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar), Ca2+ influx, lysosome rupture, cathepsin B activation, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation (21Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J. Activation of the NALP3 inflammasome is triggered by low intracellular potassium concentration.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of evidence suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome activity is sensitive to changes in ion concentrations and in particular to K+ efflux. Two classical stimuli are known to cause K+ efflux, namely bacterial toxins, such as nigericin, by forming pores in the plasma membrane, and extracellular ATP by activating the ionotropic P2X7 receptor (15Mariathasan S. Weiss D.S. Newton K. McBride J. O'Rourke K. Roose-Girma M. Lee W.P. Weinrauch Y. Monack D.M. Dixit V.M. Cryopyrin activates the inflammasome in response to toxins and ATP.Nature. 2006; 440: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar). More importantly, increasing the potassium concentration in the media, which inhibits K+ efflux, can potently inhibit NLRP3 activation by many different stimuli. Ionic fluctuations result in changes in intracellular pH, membrane potential, and cell volume, which must be tightly regulated to maintain cell function and homeostasis. A remarkable feature of LPS-ATP-stimulated macrophages is cell-swelling (22Perregaux D.G. Laliberte R.E. Gabel C.A. Human monocyte interleukin-1β posttranslational processing. Evidence of a volume-regulated response.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29830-29838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a response that is controlled by the coordinated action of K+ and Cl−, and the activity of multiple ion channels, a process known as regulatory volume decrease (RVD). A study by Compan et al. (23Compan V. Baroja-Mazo A. López-Castejón G. Gomez A.I. Martínez C.M. Angosto D. Montero M.T. Herranz A.S. Bazán E. Reimers D. Mulero V. Pelegrín P.

Based on the fact that all inflammasome activators induce changes in cell volume, the authors proposed that mechanosensitive ion channels may be general regulators of inflammasome activation. In accordance with this hypothesis, application of hypertonic solutions blocked the release of IL-1β in response to all NLRP3 activators in vitro and reduced inflammasome activity in a rat model of brain inflammation (23Compan V.

Chloride intracellular channel proteins (CLICs 1–6) are a family of evolutionary conserved proteins whose structure belongs to glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fold superfamily. In response to increased cytoplasmic oxidation or pH changes, cytoplasmic soluble CLIC proteins insert into cellular membranes where they act as anion channels that counteract cationic fluctuations. CLIC proteins participate in a number of biological functions, including regulation of membrane potential, cell volume regulation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (26Littler D.R. Harrop S.J.

Upon phagocytosis, CLIC1 has been shown to translocate into the phagosomal membrane where it colocalizes with NADH oxidase and modulates phagosomal acidification. CLIC1−/− macrophages displayed impaired phagosomal proteolytic capacity and reduced reactive oxygen species production (30Jiang L. Salao K. Li H. Rybicka J.M. Yates R.M. Luo X.W. Shi X.X. Kuffner T.

These studies prompted us to investigate the role of CLIC1 and CLIC4 channels during the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. We provide evidence for a role for CLIC1 and CLIC4 in both the induction of pro-IL1β and the activation of NLRP3, identifying CLICs as key regulators of the IL-1β system. K+ efflux is a common denominator in NLRP3 activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion, a mechanism that can be blocked by increasing the extracellular K+ (21Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 7623-7634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting that anions or anion channels may play a role in the IL-1 β response. We reexamined the effects of culturing macrophages in a high extracellular KCl or NaCl medium. ATP-induced IL-1β release in LPS-primed macrophages, BMDMs, and J774 cells were exposed to different concentrations of NaCl or KCl for 30 min after LPS priming before ATP stimulation. The addition of different concentrations of KCl into the extracellular media, ranging from 25 to 50 mm, triggered a significant decrease in a dose-dependent manner of secreted IL-1β in both BMDMs and J774 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). The addition of 25 mm or 50 mm KCl resulted in a >50% reduction on the amount of secreted IL-1β. We used the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 (34Coll R.C. Robertson A.A. Chae J.J. Higgins S.C.

Núñez G. et al.A small-molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar) as a positive control for inhibition. KCl did not have any significant impact on the production of TNF-α in BMDMs or J774 cells (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively). This result confirms that increasing the extracellular concentration of K+, which in turn impedes a net K+ efflux, can block secretion of IL-1β. However, the addition of different concentrations of NaCl, ranging from 50 mm to 100 mm, to the extracellular media also resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease of IL-1β release in both BMDMs and J774 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, production of TNF-α remained at similar levels regardless of the extracellular NaCl concentrations (Fig. 1, C and D), mimicking the results observed in cells exposed to high KCl conditions. To address the effects of the removal of extracellular Cl−, Na+ and K+ were counterbalanced with the impermeant anion gluconate. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis demonstrated that extracellular NaGln, ranging from 50 to 130 mm, actually increased the production of ATP-induced IL-1β in a dose-dependent manner relative to BMDMs cultured with a high extracellular NaCl (100 mm) (Fig. 1E). As expected, when BMDMs were treated with equimolar concentrations of KGln, IL-1β secretion was inhibited, as K+ efflux is impeded by the high extracellular K+ concentration (Fig. 1E). However, treatments with NaGln or KGln had no effect on TNF-α production (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data suggest that the efflux of Cl− and/or other anions could be involved in the maturation of IL-1β. In the absence of ATP, NaCl has been reported to induce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in BMDMs in a K+ efflux-independent manner (38Ip W.K. Medzhitov R. Macrophages monitor tissue osmolarity and induce inflammatory response through NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasome activation.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To verify the dual role of NaCl in NLRP3 activation, BMDMs primed with 100 ng/ml LPS for 3 h were placed in a high NaCl medium (ranging from 25 mm to 100 mm) overnight. We were able to confirm the increased release of IL-1β, although the effect was much more modest than with ATP (Fig. 1G). No significant differences were observed on the production of TNF-α (Fig. 1H). In contrast to NaCl, when BMDMs were treated with 25–50 mm KCl after LPS, no increase in IL-1β secretion was detected (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, the addition of different concentrations of KCl or NaCl did not significantly change TNF-α production (Fig. 1H), again indicating the specificity of the effect on IL-1β-processing and release. The dual effect of NaCl on IL-1β release suggests that differences in treatment timings lead to different molecular mechanisms that either inhibit or induce IL-1β release. Taken together, these results confirm what was previously reported by Perregaux and Gabel (22Perregaux D.G. Laliberte R.E. Gabel C.A. Human monocyte interleukin-1β posttranslational processing.

Macrophages monitor tissue osmolarity and induce inflammatory response through NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasome activation.Nat.

The inhibitory effect of both KCl and NaCl on IL-1β secretion and the promoting effect of NaGln suggested that chloride efflux might mediate this effect. To evaluate this further, we examined two chloride channel inhibitors NPPB and DIDS. Both agents had a strong dose-dependent inhibitory effect on IL-1β secretion induced by ATP (Fig. 2, A and B). A dose of 200 μm NPPB or DIDS prevented IL-1β secretion to the same extent as that observed using the NLRP3 selective inhibitor MCC950. Neither agent had a significant impact on secretion of TNF-α by BMDMs or J774 cells (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively). These results indicated that chloride ion efflux might be required for NLRP3 activation. We next examined whether chloride ions could also impact on IL-1β release triggered by another inflammasome, the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2. Interestingly, NPPB and DIDS chloride inhibitors only partially inhibited IL-1β release and only at the highest concentration tested (200 μm) (Fig. 2, E and F). However, a slight decrease of TNF-α secretion was also observed on cells treated with 200 μm NPPB or DIDS (Fig. 2G), suggesting that the inhibitory effects observed could be related to toxicity. To ensure that the NPPB and DIDS concentrations used did not cause major toxic effects on the cells, an lactate dehydrogenase assay was performed on the supernatant of each of the treated cells. Based on the amounts of lactate dehydrogenase released into the extracellular media, only a 5% reduction on cell viability was observed on cells treated with 200 μm NPPB or DIDS. No significant reduction on cell viability was observed when using lower concentrations (data not shown). Because the increase of extracellular osmolarity and the inhibition of chloride channels impaired the release of IL-1β, we sought to determine whether chloride channels could control NLRP3 activation. Compounds highly related to the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 have been shown to interact with the chloride intracellular channel CLIC1 (35Laliberte R.E. Perregaux D.G. Hoth L.R. Rosner P.J. Jordan C.K.

Expression of CLIC1 and CLIC4 mRNA was evaluated by RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR) in BMDMs, J774, and RAW 264.7 cells in a time-course study. CLIC1 mRNA was not significantly changed in LPS-stimulated BMDMs, J774, or RAW 264.7 cells during the time-course studied (Fig. 3, A–C). However, a significant increase of CLIC4 mRNA expression was observed at 2, 4, and 8 h after LPS stimulation in BMDMs and RAW 264.7 (Fig. 3, D and F, respectively). CLIC4 mRNA expression in J774 was not significantly changed after LPS stimulation; however, a trend to increased expression was observed (Fig. 3E). Western blot analysis revealed that CLIC1 protein levels were similar across the different LPS time points, and a slight increase of CLIC4 was observed in J774 and RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 3, G–I). The above results confirmed that LPS induces expression of CLIC4, which agrees with He et al. (32He G. Ma Y. Chou S.Y. Li H. Yang C. Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. Ding A.

Although the influence of dietary DHA on visual acuity is well known and the retina has an abundance of DHA-containing phospholipids (PL-DHA), the mechanisms associated with DHA's effects on visual function are unknown. We previously identified lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 3 (LPAAT3) as a PL-DHA biosynthetic enzyme. Here, using comprehensive phospholipid analyses and imaging mass spectroscopy, we found that LPAAT3 is expressed in the inner segment of photoreceptor cells and that PL-DHA disappears from the outer segment in the LPAAT3-knock-out mice. Dynamic light-scattering analysis of liposomes and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the physical characteristics of DHA reduced membrane-bending rigidity. Following loss of PL-DHA, LPAAT3-knock-out mice exhibited abnormalities in the retinal layers, such as incomplete elongation of the outer segment and decreased thickness of the outer nuclear layers and impaired visual function, as well as disordered disc morphology in photoreceptor cells. Our results indicate that PL-DHA contributes to visual function by maintaining the disc shape in photoreceptor cells and that this is a function of DHA in the retina. This study thus provides the reason why DHA is required for visual acuity and may help inform approaches for overcoming retinal disorders associated with DHA deficiency or dysfunction.

Although essential for vision, the clearance of 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal from the photoreceptor disc membrane is important due to their highly reactive aldehyde groups. 11-cis-Retinal with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is isomerized to the all-trans form, which is then reduced by retinol dehydrogenase 8 for entry into the visual cycle of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (8Quazi F.

Currently, the elucidation of molecular mechanisms associated with DHA is needed for understanding of visual functions. Recently, we partially identified the molecular mechanism associated with DHA incorporation into phospholipids (15Harayama T. Eto M. Shindou H. Kita Y. Otsubo E. Hishikawa D. Ishii S. Sakimura K.

DHA is first activated to DHA-CoA, which is esterified to lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid (PA) by lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 3 (LPAAT3) (16Yuki K. Shindou H. Hishikawa D.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids are incorporated into maturating male mouse germ cells by lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 3.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the relationship between LPAAT3 and retinas, which contain high amounts of DHA-containing phospholipids (PL-DHA). We observed that LPAAT3 was highly expressed in the retina and that LPAAT3 deficiency dramatically lowered PL-DHA levels in the outer segment (OS) of photoreceptors and impaired visual functions. Additionally, disc morphology and/or organization in the OS of LPAAT3-knock-out (LPAAT3-KO) mice was disrupted. Cellular membrane with PL-DHA was more flexible than those with phospholipid-containing arachidonic acid (PL-AA) and other fatty acids according to analyses using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our findings demonstrate DHA involvement in maintaining disc properties in the retina and provide insight into the roles of DHA in visual function. In the accompanying paper (56Iizuka-Hishikawa Y.

We have previously reported the age-dependent up-regulation of mouse LPAAT3 in the testis (16Yuki K. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Shimizu T.

In this study, LPAAT3 levels were mainly evaluated in DHA-abundant mouse tissues. Quantitative-PCR analysis showed that LPAAT3 mRNA levels were higher in the retina, followed by the testis, in 8-week-old mice (Fig. 1A). LPAAT3 protein levels also increased in an age-dependent manner in the retina (wild-type (WT) in Fig. 1B). To examine the role of LPAAT3 in the retina, we constructed LPAAT3-KO mice as described in detail in the accompanying paper (56Iizuka-Hishikawa Y. Hishikawa D. Sasaki J. Takubo K. Goto M. Nagata K. Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Okamura T. Ito C. Toshimori K. Sasaki T. Shimizu T.

Comprehensive phospholipid analysis of the retina was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect PA, PC, PE, phosphatidylserine (PS) (Fig. 2, A–D), and PC with long chain fatty acids (total carbon number >54) (Fig. 2E), as well as phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), oxidized PC, LPA, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lyso-PE, lyso-PG, lyso-PS, and lyso-PI (supplemental Fig. S1, A–I). In the retina of LPAAT3-KO mice, PL-DHA levels were almost abolished, whereas the PL-AA levels increased compared with WT mice. Oxidized PC generated from PC-DHA also decreased in LPAAT3-KO retinas (supplemental Fig. S1C). We also performed MS/MS analyses to investigate the acyl-chain composition of the representative PC species (PC38:4, PC38:6, and PC40:6). Each PC subspecies had an almost single acyl-chain composition (supplemental Fig. S1J). From the results, PC38:4, PC38:6, and PC40:6 were identified as PC18:0/20:4, PC16:0/22:6, and PC18:0/22:6 molecular species, respectively.Figure 2Attenuation of PL-DHA in LPAAT3-KO retinas. PA (A), PC (B), PE (C), PS (D), and PC with very long chain fatty acids (E) were measured by comprehensive phospholipid analysis and indicated by the area ratio (y axis, 100% indicates sum of the detected signals for each phospholipid). The x axis indicates the summation of fatty acid information at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions (number of carbon and double bonds, i.e. 34:0) in the phospholipids. 38:6, 40:6, and 44:12 in all phospholipids and very long chain in PC may contain DHA, which were suppressed in LPAAT3-KO mice. By contrast, 36:4, 38:4, and 40:4 may contain AA and were increased in LPAAT3-KO mice. 34:1 and 36:1 thought to have oleic acid were increased. These data were obtained from p11 to 8-week-old mice; WT (black) and LPAAT3-KO (magenta). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. F, PC localization of 8-week-old mice (WT, upper; KO, lower) was observed by imaging mass microscope. PC32:0, PC34:1, PC38:4, and PC40:6 are supposed to have C16:0 (palmitic acid), C18:1 (oleic acid), C20:4 (AA), and C22:6 (DHA), respectively. The signals of PC40:6 were disappeared in the OS of LPAAT3-KO retina. Imaging data of phospholipids were merged with captured light images. Scale bar, 70 μm. Two independent experiments were performed with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the cell type in which PL-DHA was depleted in LPAAT3-KO retinas, we next examined PL-DHA localization in the retina by using an imaging mass microscope, iMscope TRIO (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). In addition to PC containing DHA and AA, representative PCs are shown in Fig. 2F. PC32:0, PC34:1, PC38:4, and PC40:6 are supposed to have C16:0 (palmitic acid), C18:1 (oleic acid), C20:4 (arachidonic acid, AA), and C22:6 (DHA), respectively. PC40:6 (supposed to have DHA, PC-DHA) was detected in the OS of WT retinas but disappeared in the OS of LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 2F). By contrast, PC38:4 (PC-AA) levels increased in LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 2F). These results were consistent with more quantitative analyses by LC-MS data (Fig. 2B). The levels of PC32:0 and PC34:1 were similar between WT and LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 2F). From these results, abundant PL-DHA was located at the OS of the retina, but it almost disappeared during LPAAT3 deficiency. Our observations of disrupted PL-DHA levels in LPAAT3-KO mice encouraged us to examine the physical properties of lipid bilayers composed of several PCs, including PC-DHA. Thus, we studied the size of liposomes with known phospholipid contents. Liposomes composed of di-oleoyl-PC (DOPC), di-arachidonoyl-PC (DAPC), or di-DHA-PC (DDPC) (Fig. 3A) were constructed and analyzed by DLS using a Zetasizer NanoZSP (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). Although each liposome size was adjusted by passage through a 100-nm filter, the z-average diameters (light-intensity weighted hydrodynamic diameters) of DAPC or DDPC liposomes were smaller than that of DOPC liposomes (Fig. 3B). After additional passage through a 50-nm filter, DDPC liposome size decreased significantly relative to those of DAPC and DOPC (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that differences in fatty acid physical characteristics directly affected each liposome size, i.e. the physical property of membranes containing DDPC differed from those containing DAPC or DOPC. Liposomes consisting of PC with mixed acyl chains having stearic acid at the sn-1 position and oleic acid, AA, or DHA at the sn-2 position did not show any differences (data not shown); the differences in diameter, if they existed, might have been less than the sensitivity limit of the assay. We then calculated membrane elasticity by MD simulations using GROMACS 5.1 simulation packages (20Pall S. Abraham M.J. Kutzner C. Hess B. Lindahl E. Tackling exascale software challenges in molecular dynamics simulations with gromacs.In Solving software challenges for exascale. 2014; : 3-27Google Scholar, 21Abraham M.J. Murtola T. Schulz R.

Gromacs: High performance molecular simulations through multi-level parallelism from laptops to supercomputers.SoftwareX. 2015; 1: 19-25Crossref Scopus (9737) Google Scholar). Each membrane area expansion modulus (KA) was estimated (supplemental Fig. S2) to calculate the membrane bending rigidity (κ) for three different membranes composed of either DOPC, DAPC, or DDPC. The membrane rigidity of DDPC was lower than the rigidity of DOPC and DAPC at 30 °C, indicating that DDPC is more flexible than the others (Fig. 3C). These differences in κ might be attributed to the number of double bonds in the three phospholipid species. PE liposomes using di-oleoyl-PE (DOPE), di-arachidonoyl-PE (DAPE), or di-DHA-PC (DDPE) showed a similar trend (Fig. 3C). Although the effect of double bonds on bending rigidity was decreased at 50 and 70 °C (supplemental Fig. S2), DDPC showed the lowest κ at all three temperatures. LPAAT3-KO retinas indicated decreases and increases of PL-DHA and PL-AA levels, respectively, with each exhibiting distinct physical properties. To examine whether the elimination of PL-DHA would affect retinal structure, we next performed histological analyses of LPAAT3-KO retinas. The thicknesses of the outer nuclear layer (ONL), inner nuclear layer (INL), inner segment (IS), and OS were comparable between WT and LPAAT3-KO retinas at ∼2 weeks following birth (Fig. 4, A–D), indicating that early retinal development was not significantly affected by PL-DHA deficiency. However, 3–8-week-old mice exhibited fully elongated OS with IS in WT retinas but not in LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 4, A and B). This developmental benchmark in OS coincided with increased LPAAT3 expression in the retinas (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the ONL in 6- and 8-week-old LPAAT3-KO retinas were thinner than those in WT retinas (Fig. 4, A, C, and E), whereas the INL thickness was similar between WT and LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 4, A, D, and F). Next, the expression patterns of LPAAT3 and markers for rod photoreceptor cells (rhodopsin and recoverin) and cone photoreceptor cells (M-opsin) were detected by immunohistochemistry. We observed that LPAAT3 was localized in the IS indicating that PL-DHA was biosynthesized by LPAAT3 in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or other organelles in photoreceptor cells (Fig. 4G). Rhodopsin was primarily localized to the OS of rod photoreceptor cells in WT and LPAAT3-KO retinas; however, in LPAAT3-KO retinas, rhodopsin expression may have shown a slightly disturbed pattern in ONL. By contrast, recoverin was mainly expressed in the IS of WT retinas but appeared diffusely in both the IS and OS of LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, M-opsin was aligned in the OS of WT retinas but exhibited fragmented signals in LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 4G). Thus, the structures of the IS and OS were disorganized, and rhodopsin was partially stacked at ONL in LPAAT3-KO retinas. Next, we examined whether the damage of retinal structure was affected by phototoxicity. ABCA4 clears 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal from the photoreceptor disc membrane to protect against phototoxicity (11Quazi F. Lenevich S. Molday R.S. ABCA4 is an N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylethanolamine importer.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 925Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). During this step, 11-cis-retinal combined with PE-DHA is effectively isomerized to an all-trans isomer by retinol dehydrogenase 8 and enters the visual cycle (8Quazi F. Molday R.S. ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA4 and chemical isomerization protect photoreceptor cells from the toxic accumulation of excess 11-cis-retinal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 5024-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We also investigated the effect of phototoxicity on retinal degeneration in LPAAT3-KO mice. Mice were housed under dark conditions for a 2-week period when they were 1–3 weeks old, and then their retinal layers were analyzed. The OS/IS and ONL of LPAAT3-KO retinas were lower than those of WT mice (Fig. 5) with similar results obtained under normal light/dark cycle conditions (Fig. 4, A–F). These results demonstrate that retinal degeneration of LPAAT3-KO mice was not caused by phototoxicity. To examine the effect of PL-DHA attenuation and OS damage on visual function, 8-week-old LPAAT3-KO mice were assessed by ERGs. A dark-adapted ERG revealed 80 and 50% decreases in the a- and b-wave amplitudes, respectively, in LPAAT3-KO retinas at light intensities of 4.5 cd·s/m2 (Fig. 6, A–C). Similarly, light-adapted ERG showed 80 and 70% decreases in the a- and b-waves, respectively, in LPAAT3-KO retinas at light intensities of 22.3 cd·s/m2 (Fig. 6, D–F). Therefore, these results indicate that loss of PL-DHA as a consequence of LPAAT3 deficiency resulted in visual dysfunction. We further examined the precise structure of the IS and OS of photoreceptor cells in LPAAT3-KO retinas by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The retinas of 3-week-old mice were investigated, because the OS length was shortened significantly in LPAAT3-KO retinas according to the retinal sections in this stage (Fig. 4, A and B). At low magnification, the OS was well organized, and the disc exhibited normal formation in WT retinas (Fig. 7, A–C) but not in LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 7, D–H). Highly disorganized but membranous disc-like structures were detected at the basal side of the OS in LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 7E). However, RPE cells exhibiting normal structures may not affect OS abnormality in LPAAT3-KO retinas (Fig. 7D). Close examination of the IS-OS junction in LPAAT3-KO retinas revealed no drastic morphological changes in the IS and the connecting cilium (Fig. 7, F–H). Given that discs showed abnormal morphology compared with WT (Fig. 7C), but were at least formed and located at the OS in LPAAT3-KO retinas, membrane evagination and/or fusion at the base of the OS (22Ding J.D. Salinas R.Y. Arshavsky V.Y. Discs of mammalian rod photoreceptors form through the membrane evagination mechanism.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 211: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) might still be processed normally (WT, Fig. 7C; KO, Fig. 7, F and G). However, abnormal discs parallel to the axoneme, which is a hallmark of abnormal OS morphogenesis (23Gilliam J.C. Chang J.T. Sandoval I.M. Zhang Y. Li T. Pittler S.J. Chiu W. Wensel T.G. Three-dimensional architecture of the rod sensory cilium and its disruption in retinal neurodegeneration.Cell. 2012; 151: 1029-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), were also observed in LPAAT3 KO retinas (Fig. 7, F and H). These results indicate that PL-DHA might be more essential for disc organization and/or maintenance of morphology than for new disc formation at the basal OS. Combined with DLS and MD simulation data, our results reveal that the different physical properties of phospholipids induced the distinct disc characteristics between WT and LPAAT3-KO retinas. Based on their structural flexibilities, PL-DHA but not PL-AA may be essential for disc organization/morphology (Fig. 8).Figure 8Model figures of DHA roles.

Low levels of PL-DHA in LPAAT3-KO-induced abnormal disc morphology/organization, which was not rescued by increased PL-AA levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This study provides a molecular mechanism associated with how DHA promotes visual functions. Attenuation of PL-DHA in retina as a consequence of LPAAT3 deficiency induced visual dysfunction due to the disruption of disc morphology in photoreceptor cells. DLS analysis revealed distinct physical properties of DDPC liposomes as compared with those of DAPC liposomes according to the increased number of double bonds in fatty acids. These results from DLS analysis were supported by MD simulations. This study proposes a molecular mechanism of DHA functions in photoreceptor cells formation (Fig. 8). In LPAAT3-KO retinas, although PL-DHA levels were strongly suppressed, PL-AA levels were increased (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1). We do not have a clear answer regarding the mechanism by which PL-AA increased; therefore, fatty acid metabolism in the LPAAT3-KO retinas requires future investigation. However, increased PL-AA did not compensate for lack of PL-DHA in disc maintenance and/or organization. One possible reason might be explained from the results of DLS analysis and MD simulations (Fig. 3, B and C). These results consistently indicate that the limit sizes of liposomes were reduced coinciding decreases with phase transition temperature, which decreases with increasing double bond number in fatty acids (24Zhigaltsev I.V. Tam Y.K. Leung A.K. Cullis P.R. Production of limit size nanoliposomal systems with potential utility as ultra-small drug delivery agents.J. Liposome Res. 2016; 26: 96-102PubMed Google Scholar). The high flexibility resulting from fatty acid desaturation in phospholipids might contribute to the maintenance of precise disc conformations (Fig. 8). Recently, polyunsaturation of fatty acids was reported to promote fluidity on both two-dimensional (x-y plane) and three-"

We show that scaffold assembly requires conserved leucine zipper (LZ) and Cnn-motif 2 (CM2) domains that co-assemble into a 2:2 complex in vitro. We solve the crystal structure of the LZ:CM2 complex, revealing that both proteins form helical dimers that assemble into an unusual tetramer. A slightly longer version of the LZ can form micron-scale structures with CM2, whose assembly is stimulated by Plk1 phosphorylation in vitro. Mutating individual residues that perturb LZ:CM2 tetramer assembly perturbs the formation of these micron-scale assemblies in vitro and Cnn-scaffold assembly in vivo. Thus, Cnn molecules have an intrinsic ability to form large, LZ:CM2-interaction-dependent assemblies that are critical for mitotic centrosome assembly. These studies provide the first atomic insight into a molecular interaction required for mitotic centrosome assembly."

The authors demonstrate that, in mice, activation of a subset of neurons in the parabrachial nucleus mediate cancer-induced anorexia and associated sickness behaviors. Anorexia is a common manifestation of chronic diseases, including cancer. Here we investigate the contribution to cancer anorexia made by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) that transmit anorexic signals. We show that CGRPPBN neurons are activated in mice implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Inactivation of CGRPPBN neurons before tumor implantation prevents anorexia and loss of lean mass, and their inhibition after symptom onset reverses anorexia. CGRPPBN neurons are also activated in Apcmin/+ mice, which develop intestinal cancer and lose weight despite the absence of reduced food intake. Inactivation of CGRPPBN neurons in Apcmin/+ mice permits hyperphagia that counteracts weight loss, revealing a role for these neurons in a 'nonanorexic' cancer model. We also demonstrate that inactivation of CGRPPBN neurons prevents lethargy, anxiety and malaise associated with cancer. These findings establish CGRPPBN neurons as key mediators of cancer-induced appetite suppression and associated behavioral changes."
https://openalex.org/W2951734993,"Mammalian chromosomes are organized in structural and functional domains of 0.1–10 Mb, which are characterized by high self-association frequencies in the nuclear space and different contact probabilities with nuclear sub-compartments. They exhibit distinct chromatin modification patterns, gene expression levels and replication timing. Recently, nucleolus-associated chromosomal domains (NADs) have been discovered, yet their precise genomic organization and dynamics are still largely unknown. Here, we use nucleolus genomics and single-cell experiments to address these questions in human embryonic fibroblasts during replicative senescence. Genome-wide mapping reveals 1,646 NADs in proliferating cells, which cover about 38% of the annotated human genome. They are mainly heterochromatic and correlate with late replicating loci. Using Hi-C data analysis, we show that interactions of NADs dominate interphase chromosome contacts in the 10–50 Mb distance range. Interestingly, only minute changes in nucleolar association are observed upon senescence. These spatial rearrangements in subdomains smaller than 100 kb are accompanied with local transcriptional changes. In contrast, large centromeric and pericentromeric satellite repeat clusters extensively dissociate from nucleoli in senescent cells. Accordingly, H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin gets remodelled at the perinucleolar space as revealed by immunofluorescence analyses. Collectively, this study identifies connections between the nucleolus, 3D genome structure, and cellular aging at the level of interphase chromosome organization."
https://openalex.org/W2620578265,"Purpose In an effort for early assessment of treatment response, we investigate radiation induced changes in quantitative CT features of tumor during the delivery of chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for pancreatic cancer. Methods Diagnostic-quality CT data acquired daily during routine CT-guided CRT using a CT-on-rails for 20 pancreatic head cancer patients were analyzed. On each daily CT, the pancreatic head, the spinal cord and the aorta were delineated and the histograms of CT number (CTN) in these contours were extracted. Eight histogram-based radiomic metrics including the mean CTN (MCTN), peak position, volume, standard deviation (SD), skewness, kurtosis, energy and entropy were calculated for each fraction. Paired t-test was used to check the significance of the change of specific metric at specific time. GEE model was used to test the association between changes of metrics over time for different pathology responses. Results In general, CTN histogram in the pancreatic head (but not in spinal cord) changed during the CRT delivery. Changes from the 1st to the 26th fraction in MCTN ranged from -15.8 to 3.9 HU with an average of -4.7 HU (p<0.001). Meanwhile the volume decreased, the skewness increased (less skewed), and the kurtosis decreased (less peaked). The changes of MCTN, volume, skewness, and kurtosis became significant after two weeks of treatment. Patient pathological response is associated with the changes of MCTN, SD, and skewness. In cases of good response, patients tend to have large reductions in MCTN and skewness, and large increases in SD and kurtosis. Conclusions Significant changes in CT radiomic features, such as the MCTN, skewness, and kurtosis in tumor were observed during the course of CRT for pancreas cancer based on quantitative analysis of daily CTs. These changes may be potentially used for early assessment of treatment response and stratification for therapeutic intensification."

Early diagnosis and identification of carriers of heritable RB1 mutations can improve disease outcome and management. In this study, mutational analysis was conducted on fifty-nine matched tumor and peripheral blood samples from 18 bilateral and 41 unilateral unrelated RB cases by a combinatorial approach of Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) assay, deletion screening, direct sequencing, copy number gene dosage analysis and methylation assays. Screening of both blood and tumor samples yielded a mutation detection rate of 94.9% (56/59) while only 42.4% (25/59) of mutations were detected if blood samples alone were analyzed. Biallelic mutations were observed in 43/59 (72.9%) of tumors screened. There were 3 cases (5.1%) in which no mutations could be detected and germline mutations were detected in 19.5% (8/41) of unilateral cases. A total of 61 point mutations were identified, of which 10 were novel. There was a high incidence of previously reported recurrent mutations, occurring at 38.98% (23/59) of all cases. Of interest were three cases of mosaic RB1 mutations detected in the blood from patients with unilateral retinoblastoma. Additionally, two germline mutations previously reported to be associated with low-penetrance phenotypes: missense-c.1981C>T and splice variant-c.607+1G>T, were observed in a bilateral and a unilateral proband, respectively. These findings have implications for genetic counselling and risk prediction for the affected families. This is the first published report on the spectrum of mutations in RB patients from Singapore and shows that further improved mutation screening strategies are required in order to provide a definitive molecular diagnosis for every case of RB. Our findings also underscore the importance of genetic testing in supporting individualized disease management plans for patients and asymptomatic family members carrying low-penetrance, germline mosaicism or heritable unilateral mutational phenotypes."

Specifically, it is unclear which factors determine DHA incorporation into cell membranes and how DHA exerts biological effects. We found that lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 3 (LPAAT3) is required for producing DHA-containing phospholipids in various tissues, such as the testes and retina.

https://openalex.org/W2621399005,"Fall prediction in geriatric patients remains challenging because the increased fall risk involves multiple, interrelated factors caused by natural aging and/or pathology. Therefore, we used a multi-factorial statistical approach to model categories of modifiable fall risk factors among geriatric patients to identify fallers with highest sensitivity and specificity with a focus on gait performance. Patients (n = 61, age = 79; 41% fallers) underwent extensive screening in three categories: (1) patient characteristics (e.g., handgrip strength, medication use, osteoporosis-related factors) (2) cognitive function (global cognition, memory, executive function), and (3) gait performance (speed-related and dynamic outcomes assessed by tri-axial trunk accelerometry). Falls were registered prospectively (mean follow-up 8.6 months) and one year retrospectively. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on 11 gait variables was performed to determine underlying gait properties. Three fall-classification models were then built using Partial Least Squares–Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), with separate and combined analyses of the fall risk factors. PCA identified ‘pace’, ‘variability’, and ‘coordination’ as key properties of gait. The best PLS-DA model produced a fall classification accuracy of AUC = 0.93. The specificity of the model using patient characteristics was 60% but reached 80% when cognitive and gait outcomes were added. The inclusion of cognition and gait dynamics in fall classification models reduced misclassification. We therefore recommend assessing geriatric patients’ fall risk using a multi-factorial approach that incorporates patient characteristics, cognition, and gait dynamics."

Whether or not S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) is associated with clonality, implicating potential nosocomial transmission, has not, however, been investigated. Herein, we examined the epidemiology of SAB using whole genome sequencing (WGS). 152 SAB isolates collected over the course of 2015 at a single large Minnesota medical center were studied. Staphylococcus protein A (spa) typing was performed by PCR/Sanger sequencing; multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and core genome MLST (cgMLST) were determined by WGS. Forty-eight isolates (32%) were methicillin–resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The isolates encompassed 66 spa types, clustered into 11 spa clonal complexes (CCs) and 10 singleton types. 88% of 48 MRSA isolates belonged to spa CC-002 or -008. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were more genotypically diverse, with 61% distributed across four spa CCs (CC-002, CC-012, CC-008 and CC-084). By MLST, there was 31 sequence types (STs), including 18 divided into 6 CCs and 13 singleton STs. Amongst MSSA isolates, the common MLST clones were CC5 (23%), CC30 (19%), CC8 (15%) and CC15 (11%). Common MRSA clones were CC5 (67%) and CC8 (25%); there were no MRSA isolates in CC45 or CC30. By cgMLST analysis, there were 9 allelic differences between two isolates, with the remaining 150 isolates differing from each other by over 40 alleles. The two isolates were retroactively epidemiologically linked by medical record review. Overall, cgMLST analysis resulted in higher resolution epidemiological typing than did multilocus sequence or spa typing."

This study evaluated combined relationships of systemic inflammation and body size with insulin resistance in a Japanese cohort.We analyzed cross-sectional data from 1,074 eligible subjects (536 men and 538 women) aged 35-69 years who participated in the baseline survey of a cohort study in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. Systemic inflammation level was assessed by serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and the degree of insulin resistance and beta-cell function were evaluated by the homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function (HOMA-β), respectively. Overweight and obesity were defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 and ≥25.0 kg/m2, respectively. Associations between serum hs-CRP (assessed as quartiles and additionally continuous values after log-transformation) and indices of glucose homeostasis were analysed adjusting for probable covariates, including BMI (quartiles). Combined associations of serum hs-CRP (≤median, >median) and body size (normal, overweight, obese) with insulin resistance as well as their interaction effect on insulin resistance were also evaluated.Serum hs-CRP was dose-dependently associated with HOMA-IR, but not HOMA-β, after adjustment for probable covariates, including BMI. Subjects with obesity and elevated serum hs-CRP (>median) showed a high multivariable-adjusted HOMA-IR value of 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23, 1.41) compared with subjects with normal BMI and low serum hs-CRP (≤median) whose multivariable-adjusted HOMA-IR value was 1.14 (95% CI 1.06, 1.21). The interaction effect between body size (normal, overweight, obese) and serum hs-CRP (≤median, >median) on HOMA-IR was significant (P for interaction <0.001).Our study suggests that elevated systemic inflammation is dose-dependently associated with increased insulin resistance, independent of the known risk factors, in a Japanese population. Concomitant obesity and elevated systemic inflammation may synergistically contribute to increased insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2620975934,"Abundant regulatory 14-3-3 proteins have an extremely wide interactome and coordinate multiple cellular events via interaction with specifically phosphorylated partner proteins. Notwithstanding the key role of 14-3-3/phosphotarget interactions in many physiological and pathological processes, they are dramatically underexplored. Here, we focused on the 14-3-3 interaction with human Tau protein associated with the development of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Among many known phosphorylation sites within Tau, protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates several key residues of Tau and induces its tight interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. However, the stoichiometry and mechanism of 14-3-3 interaction with phosphorylated Tau (pTau) are not clearly elucidated. In this work, we describe a simple bacterial co-expression system aimed to facilitate biochemical and structural studies on the 14-3-3/pTau interaction. We show that dual co-expression of human fetal Tau with PKA in Escherichia coli results in multisite Tau phosphorylation including also naturally occurring sites which were not previously considered in the context of 14-3-3 binding. Tau protein co-expressed with PKA displays tight functional interaction with 14-3-3 isoforms of a different type. Upon triple co-expression with 14-3-3 and PKA, Tau protein could be co-purified with 14-3-3 and demonstrates complex which is similar to that formed in vitro between individual 14-3-3 and pTau obtained from dual co-expression. Although used in this study for the specific case of the previously known 14-3-3/pTau interaction, our co-expression system may be useful to study of other selected 14-3-3/phosphotarget interactions and for validations of 14-3-3 complexes identified by other methods."

In detail, Cryptosporidium was detected in 9.3% (8/86) of turkeys, 5.7% (9/158) of broilers and 8.3% (1/12) of layers. After DNA sequencing, Cryptosporidium parvum the most frequently observed species was identified in 5.1% (13/256) of all poultry species, including 8.1% (7/86) of turkeys, 3.2% (5/158) of broilers and 8.3% (1/12) of layers. Cryptosporidium baileyi was detected in 1.3% (2/256) of the broilers only. Three novel unclassified Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in 1.2% (1/86) of turkeys and 1.3% (2/158) of broilers. The infection rate was high in 13–20 week old turkeys, 1–6 weeks old broilers and >20 weeks old layers but differences between age groups were not significant. This is the first study in Germany uses molecular methods for the detection of Cryptosporidium in poultry. The results indicate that Cryptosporidium parasites are common among broilers and turkeys in Germany. Considering the large size of the poultry industry, the large amount of poultry meat that is consumed and the fact that C. parvum is also the most common Cryptosporidium parasite in humans, poultry might also be a source of human infections."

However, the underlying etiology is not well understood. An iTRAQ proteomics was used to reveal the involvement of inflammation factors in TOLF. TNF-α is a pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Protein profiling analysis showed that the protein level of TNF-α increased in the ossified ligamentum flavum of TOLF, which was confirmed by western blot. The effects of TNF-α on primary ligamentum flavum cells was examined. Cell proliferation assay demonstrated that primary cells from the ossified ligamentum flavum of TOLF grew faster than the control. Flow cytometry assay indicated that the proportions of cells in S phase of cell cycle of primary cells increased after TNF-α stimulation. To address the effect of TNF-α on gene expression, primary cells were derived from ligamentum flavum of TOLF patients. Culture cells were stimulated by TNF-α. RNA was isolated and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. G1/S-specific proteins cyclin D1 and c-Myc were upregulated after TNF-α stimulation. On the other hand, osteoblast differentiation related genes such as Bmp2 and Osterix (Osx) were upregulated in the presence of TNF-α. TNF-α activated Osx expression in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK inhibitor U0126, but not JNK kinase inhibitor SP600125, abrogated TNF-α activation of Osx expression. This suggests that TNF-α activates Osx expression through the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK pathway. Taken together, we provide the evidence to support that TNF-α involves in TOLF probably through regulating cell proliferation via cyclin D1 and c-Myc, and promoting osteoblast differentiation via Osx."

This study aimed to pilot the use of computerised facial expression analysis software to investigate emotion expression across the ED spectrum and recovery in a large sample of participants.297 participants with AN, BN, RecAN, and healthy controls were recruited. Participants watched film clips designed to elicit happy or sad emotions, and facial expressions were then analysed using FaceReader.The finding mirrored those from previous work showing that healthy control and RecAN participants expressed significantly more positive emotions during the positive clip compared to the AN group. There were no differences in emotion expression during the sad film clip.These findings support the use of computerised methods to analyse emotion expression in EDs. The findings also demonstrate that reduced positive emotion expression is likely to be associated with the acute stage of AN illness, with individuals with BN showing an intermediate profile."

However, the prevalence and risk factors associated with microalbuminuria in Korean youth are unknown. Objectives The aims of this study are to evaluate the prevalence of microalbuminuria and the association between microalbuminuria and obesity or cardiometabolic risk factors in Korean children and adolescents without diabetes. Methods This study examines data obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (between 2011 and 2014). It includes a total of 1,976 participants aged between 10 and 19 years (boys 1,128 and girls 848). Microalbuminuria was defined as a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of ≥ 30 mg/g and < 300 mg/g. Association between microalbuminuria and the risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases including insulin resistance was evaluated. Results The prevalence of microalbuminuria was found to be 3.0% in Korean children and adolescents over this time period. The mean UACR for non-obese youth was significantly greater than that found in obese youth (3.2 ± 0.1 mg/g in the non-obese group vs. 2.1 ± 0.2 mg/g in the obese group; P < 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, microalbuminuria was associated with hyperglycemia (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.09–6.30) and hemoglobin A1c (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.09–10.17) in the non-obese group and hypertension (OR 14.10, 95% CI 1.12–177.98) and HbA1c (OR 6.68, 95% CI 1.87–23.95) in the obese group. Conclusions The prevalence of microalbuminuria is not prominent in obese children and adolescents. Our findings demonstrated that the presence of hypertension and hyperglycemia was associated with microalbuminuria. Especially Hemoglobin A1c was associated with microalbuminuria in youths regardless of weight status.

Here we study networks of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with a new type of adaptive coupling, and show that these networks naturally produce both permanent and transient synchronization of local clusters of neurons. These deterministic systems exhibit complex dynamics with 1/fη power spectra, which appears to be a consequence of a novel form of self-organized criticality."
https://openalex.org/W2620952081,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is an idiopathic liver disease while the biochemical characteristic is the elevated level of total bile acid (TBA). The present study investigated whether miR-148a mediates the induced effect of estrogen on the development of ICP and the proper mechanism: PXR/MRP3 signal pathway. mRNA expression was detected by qPCR, protein expression was detected by western blotting, the concentration of estrogen and TBA were detected by reagent kit respectively. In the cinical research, it was found that miR-148a expression was positive related with the concentration of TBA in the serum of ICP patients. In in vitro research, estradiol (500 nmol/L, 12 h) significantly upregulated miR-148a expression and LV-148a-siRNA inhibited the function of estradiol (500 nmol/L, 48 h) on TBA secretion. In addition, gene silence of miR-148a upregulated PXR expression which was inhibited by estradiol in LO2 cells. Pretreatment of rifampin (10 μmol/L), the agonist of PXR alleviated the TBA secretion induced by estradiol (500 nmol/L, 48 h). miR-148a-siRNA and PXR had a synergistic action on TBA secretion of LO2. Both of miR-148a-siRNA and rifampin (10 μmol/L) inhibited the upregulated effect of estradiol on MRP3 expression. This research has demonstrated that miR-148a may be involved in the induction of estrogen on ICP via PXR signal pathway, and MRP3 may be involved."
https://openalex.org/W2621207332,"IgM memory cells are recognized as an important component of B cell memory in mice and humans. Our studies of B cells elicited in response to ehrlichial infection identified a population of CD11c-positive IgM memory cells, and an IgM bone marrow antibody-secreting cell population. The origin of these cells was unknown, although an early T-independent spleen CD11c- and T-bet-positive IgM plasmablast population precedes both, suggesting a linear relationship. A majority of the IgM memory cells detected after day 30 post-infection, also T-bet-positive, had undergone somatic hypermutation, indicating they expressed activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Therefore, to identify early AID-expressing precursor B cells, we infected an AID-regulated tamoxifen-inducible Cre-recombinase-EYFP reporter strain. Tamoxifen administration led to the labeling of both IgM memory cells and bone marrow ASCs on day 30 and later post-infection. High frequencies of labeled cells were identified on day 30 post-infection, following tamoxifen administration on day 10 post-infection, although IgM memory cells were marked when tamoxifen was administered as early as day 4 post-infection. Transcription of Aicda in the early plasmablasts was not detected in the absence of CD4 T cells, but occurred independently of TLR signaling. Unlike the IgM memory cells, the bone marrow IgM ASCs were elicited independent of T cell help. Moreover, Aicda was constitutively expressed in IgM memory cells, but not in bone marrow ASCs. These studies demonstrate that two distinct long-term IgM-positive B cell populations are generated early in response to infection, but are maintained via separate mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2622663150,"Growing evidence in vertebrates predicts that cellular haem levels in animals are maintained not only by a cell's internal capacity for haem synthesis in a cell-autonomous manner, but also by an inter-organ haem trafficking network through cell-non-autonomous regulation. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, a genetically and optically amenable animal model for visualizing haem-dependent signalling, we show that HRG-7, a protein with homology to aspartic proteases, mediates inter-organ signalling between the intestine and extra-intestinal tissues. Intestinal HRG-7 functions as a secreted signalling factor during haem starvation in extra-intestinal tissues and is regulated through a DBL-1, homologous to BMP5, dependent signal from neurons. Given the evidence that vertebrate homologues exist for each of the components of the HRG-7-mediated signalling pathway, it is conceivable that the cell-non-autonomous signalling framework that we uncovered in C. elegans may have functional relevance for inter-organ regulation of iron and haem metabolism in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2620603149,"Prolonged cigarette smoking (CS) causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a prevalent serious condition that may persist or progress after smoking cessation. To provide insight into how CS triggers COPD, we investigated temporal patterns of lung transcriptome expression and systemic metabolome changes induced by chronic CS exposure and smoking cessation. Whole lung RNA-seq data was analyzed at transcript and exon levels from C57Bl/6 mice exposed to CS for 1- or 7 days, for 3-, 6-, or 9 months, or for 6 months followed by 3 months of cessation using age-matched littermate controls. We identified previously unreported dysregulation of pyrimidine metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways and confirmed alterations in glutathione metabolism and circadian gene pathways. Almost all dysregulated pathways demonstrated reversibility upon smoking cessation, except the lysosome pathway. Chronic CS exposure was significantly linked with alterations in pathways encoding for energy, phagocytosis, and DNA repair and triggered differential expression of genes or exons previously unreported to associate with CS or COPD, including Lox, involved in matrix remodeling, Gp2, linked to goblet cells, and Slc22a12 and Agpat3, involved in purine and glycerolipid metabolism, respectively. CS-induced lung metabolic pathways changes were validated using metabolomic profiles of matched plasma samples, indicating that dynamic metabolic gene regulation caused by CS is reflected in the plasma metabolome. Using advanced technologies, our study uncovered novel pathways and genes altered by chronic CS exposure, including those involved in pyrimidine metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signaling and lysosome function, highlighting their potential importance in the pathogenesis or diagnosis of CS-associated conditions."

Therefore this enzyme, conserved throughout the Apicomplexa, is likely to have been obtained via lateral gene transfer from a prokaryote. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate, intracellular protozoan parasite that is able to invade and colonize a wide variety of nucleated vertebrate cells. It is a member of the Apicomplexa, a diverse phylum including important pathogens of humans and domestic animals such as Plasmodium (the causative agent of malaria), Cryptosporidium (diarrhea), Eimeria (coccidiosis in poultry), and Theileria (East Coast fever in cattle). Toxoplasma has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen, and toxoplasmosis is one of the primary opportunistic diseases in the immunocompromised, particularly AIDS patients, those receiving anti-cancer chemotherapy, and organ transplant recipients (1Chowdhury M.N. Toxoplasmosis: a review.J. Med. 1986; 17: 373-396PubMed Google Scholar). Toxoplasma infection in utero is also a significant cause of spontaneous abortion in economically important domestic animals (2Dubey J.P.

Although the basic sphingolipid, ceramide, is a secondary signaling molecule involved in, for example, apoptosis (8Prieschl E.E. Baumruker T.

These domains have been proposed to function in a diverse array of processes from the polarized trafficking of lipid-modified proteins to the assembly and activation of signal transduction complexes (11Simons K.

Following transport to the Golgi apparatus, ceramide is used to form modified or complex sphingolipids, sphingomyelin (SM), or glycosphingolipid (GSL), for example (10Young S.A. Mina J.G. Denny P.W.

One subunit, LCB2, contains the canonical PLP-binding and catalysis domain, whereas the other, LCB1, is not thought to bind this co-factor but to be important for complex stability (12Lowther J.

However, the first functionally characterized enzyme in the apicomplexan sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway has now been described as an ortholog of the yeast inositol phosphorylceramide synthase (an enzyme with no mammalian equivalent) (6Pratt S.

To enable further understanding and analyses, the identification and characterization of the key enzyme components in the apicomplexan de novo pathway is essential. Although our characterization of the Toxoplasma inositol phosphorylceramide synthase has initiated this process (6Pratt S. Wansadhipathi-Kannangara N.K. Bruce C.R. Mina J.G. Shams-Eldin H. Casas J.

Importantly, in the absence of a defined SPT, the incorporation of tritiated serine into sphingolipid species during metabolic labeling of isolated Toxoplasma and P. falciparum indicated the presence of an active apicompexan SPT (22Gerold P.

Here we describe the identification and characterization of the Toxoplasma SPT, which represents a new class of eukaryotic enzyme with a very surprising, prokaryotic, origin. These studies shed new light on the evolution of these protozoan parasites and present a paradigm shift in the way the origin of sphingolipid biosynthesis is considered. In all eukaryotes studied to date, including members of the protozoa, the first enzyme in the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway, SPT (13Hanada K. Serine palmitoyltransferase, a key enzyme of sphingolipid metabolism.Biochim. Biophys.

However, initial BLAST searches of the complete, annotated genome databases of both T. gondii (http://toxodb.org (60Gajria B. Bahl A. Brestelli J. Dommer J. Fischer S. Gao X. Heiges M. Iodice J.

Further interrogation of the Toxoplasma genome database using BLAST and the conserved 10 residue PLP-binding domain (PROSITE consensus PS00599) common to all eukaryotic SPT LCB2 proteins (27Denny P.W.

Surprisingly, the putative PLP-binding sites from both proteins were both completely conserved with respect to the 12 residue PLP-binding motif (GTFSKSXXXXGG) identified in the Sphingomonadaceae bacterial SPT (28Ikushiro H.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5749-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Further analyses demonstrated that the best characterized bacterial SPT, from S. paucimobilis, showed limited homology with the identified Toxoplasma proteins: 28 and 30% identity and 47 and 46% similarity in the C-terminal region (64% of total predicted protein) of TgSPT1 and TgSPT2, respectively (20Ikushiro H.

In addition, using the BLAST tool and the predicted Toxoplasma protein sequences, singly encoded orthologues of the putative apicomplexan SPT were also found in the genome databases of Plasmodium spp. and the chicken pathogen Eimeria tenella. Comparison of the primary amino acid sequences of the putative apicomplexan proteins with the bacterial SPT indicated the presence of an N-terminal extension, which harbors a transmembrane region absent in the prokaryotic polypeptide (Fig. 2). Taken together, these observations clearly indicated that the putative apicomplexan SPT is radically different to those of all other eukaryotes studied thus far. To prove this, it was vital to demonstrate the functionality of the apicomplexan SPT. The complete open reading frame of the predominant, tachyzoite expressed, Toxoplasma SPT, TgSPT1 (see http://toxodb.org for transcriptomic data),3 was cloned into the yeast expression vector, pRS426-MET, to create pRS426-TgSPT1. In the auxotrophic yeast strain YPH499-HIS-GAL-LCB2, the essential PLP-binding, catalytic SPT subunit LCB2 (15Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. The LCB2 gene of Saccharomyces and the related LCB1 gene encode subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase, the initial enzyme in sphingolipid synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In non-permissive glucose-containing SD medium, which inhibits expression from the GAL1 promoter, the yeast are non-viable. Transformation with pRS426-TgSPT1 allowed the growth of YPH499-HIS-GAL-LCB2 in this media, as did the ectopic expression of S. cerevisiae LCB2. In contrast, the empty vector, pRS426-MET, did not rescue the growth of the auxotrophic yeast strain (Fig. 3). These data strongly indicate that TgSPT1 is a functional orthologue of the S. cerevisiae LCB2 and, therefore, at least part of the T. gondii serine palmitoyltransferase. To analyze the functionality of TgSPT1 in vitro, a series of constructs were made in collaboration with the Oxford Protein Purification Facility in the vector pOPINS3C, where the insert is N-terminally fused to a cleavable N-HIS SUMO tag (29Berrow N.S. Alderton D. Sainsbury S. Nettleship J. Assenberg R. Rahman N. Stuart D.I. Owens R.J.

High throughput construction and small scale expression screening of multi-tag vectors in Escherichia coli.Methods. 2011; 55: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Following triage based on expression levels and product solubility, a series of these fusion proteins (with N-terminal deletions of 143, 158, 176, and 180 amino acids) were expressed, purified, and subjected to preliminary functional analyses using palmitoyl-CoA and 14C-labeled serine as substrates (supplemental Fig. S1). The truncated construct TgSPT1 Δ158 was selected for further analyses. Mass spectrometry demonstrated the reaction product of the enzyme to be KDS (Fig. 4), and therefore TgSPT1 is a bona fide SPT. To further understand enzyme function, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was utilized to determine the shape of the protein in solution and investigate whether TgSPT1 forms a homodimer similar to the bacterial orthologue. The results are summarized in Fig. 5A, which shows the experimentally derived shape of the molecule in gray as a bead model and superimposed a ribbon diagram of the homodimeric homology model of TgSPT1 based on the known crystal structure of the Sphingobacterium multivorum SPT (52Ikushiro H. Islam M.M. Okamoto A. Hoseki J. Murakawa T. Fujii S. Miyahara I. Hayashi H. Structural insights into the enzymatic mechanism of serine palmitoyltransferase from Sphingobacterium multivorum.J. Biochem. 2009; 146: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The ab initio envelope shows very good agreement with the homodimeric model, where the core of the enzyme adopts a similar conformation to the bacterial orthologue. The elongated shape of the envelope indicated increased conformational flexibility of the termini of the protein. Using the homology model of the TgSPT1 dimer, the theoretical X-ray scattering data calculated with CRYSOL (31Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H. CRYSOL: a program to evaluate X-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar) revealed some discrepancies with the experimental data (Fig. 5B). Although the shape of the curve was similar, the low intensity values are higher in the experimental data consistent with a more elongated/or larger shape as shown in the ab initio envelope. Furthermore, the homology model indicated that the co-factor PLP can bind precisely to the predicted binding motifs in each monomer at the dimer interface of the structural model (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the Toxoplasma and by extension the apicomplexan SPTs are functional as homodimers. This resembles the bacterial situation (19Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H.

As discussed above, the N-terminal extension contains a predicted transmembrane domain, and the data indicate that this does not influence functionality in vitro. It is noteworthy that Uniprot (www.uniprot.org) has predicted the P. falciparum SPT N-terminal region to target the protein to the apicoplast (32Zuegge J. Ralph S. Schmuker M. McFadden G.I.

However, the ability of TgSPT1 to complement for a deficiency of LCB2 in auxotrophic mutant yeast (Fig. 3) indicated that the protozoal enzyme is targeted to the ER, which is the locale for SPT activity in this and other eukaryotes (14Han G.

https://openalex.org/W2620682114,"Different herpesviruses have been associated with respiratory and enteric disease and mortality among seabirds and waterfowl. In 2011, a respiratory disease outbreak affected 58.3% (98/168) of the Magellanic penguins undergoing rehabilitation due to an oil spill off the southern Brazilian coast. Etiology was attributed to a novel herpesvirus identified by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and molecular studies with partial DNA sequencing. Since migration, rehabilitation and translocation may facilitate the spread of pathogens between populations and trigger the onset of clinical disease in animals with latent infections, investigation of herpesvirus occurrence in asymptomatic seabirds was performed. Samples from free-ranging seabirds were collected in Argentinian Patagonia (Magellanic penguins) and the Abrolhos Archipelago in Brazil (Brown boobies, Masked boobies, Red-billed tropicbirds, White-tailed tropicbirds and South American tern). Furthermore, asymptomatic seabirds housed at the facility where the outbreak occurred were also sampled. In total, 354 samples from eight seabird species were analyzed by PCR for herpesvirus. Four different sequences of herpesviruses were identified, one in Yellow-nosed Albatross, one in Boobies and Tropicbirds and two in Magellanic penguins. Magellanic penguin herpesvirus 1 was identified during the penguin outbreak at the rehabilitation facility in Brazil, while Magellanic penguin herpesvirus 2 was recovered from free-ranging penguins at four reproduction sites in Argentina. Phylogenic analysis of the herpesviruses sequences tentatively identified suggested that the one found in Suliformes and the one associated with the outbreak are related to sequences of viruses that have previously caused seabird die-offs. These findings reinforce the necessity for seabird disease surveillance programs overall, and particularly highlight the importance of quarantine, good hygiene, stress management and pre-release health exams in seabirds undergoing rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2621249636,"Avian influenza virus (AIV) can infect a variety of avian species and mammals, leading to severe economic losses in poultry industry and posing a substantial threat to public health. Currently, traditional virus isolation and identification is inadequate for the early diagnosis because of its labor-intensive and time-consuming features. Real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) is an ideal method for the detection of AIV since it is highly specific, sensitive and rapid. In addition, as the new quencher MGB is used in RRT-PCR, it only needs shorter probe and helps the binding of target gene and probe. In this study, a pan-AIV RRT-PCR for the detection of all AIVs and H5-AIV RRT-PCR for detection of H5 AIV based on NP gene of AIV and HA gene of H5 AIV were successfully established using Taqman-MGB method. We tested 14 AIV strains in total and the results showed that the pan-AIV RRT-PCR can detect AIV of various HA subtypes and the H5-AIV RRT-PCR can detect H5 AIV circulating in poultry in China in recent three years, including H5 viruses of clade 7.2, clade 2.3.4.4 and clade 2.3.2.1. Furthermore, the multiplex detection limit for pan-AIV and H5-AIV RRT-PCR was 5 copies per reaction. When this multiplex method was applied in the detection of experimental and live poultry market samples, the detection rates of pan-AIV and H5 AIV in RRT-PCR were both higher than the routine virus isolation method with embryonated chicken eggs. The multiplex RRT-PCR method established in our study showed high sensitivity, reproducibility and specificity, suggesting the promising application of our method for surveillance of both pan AIV and prevalent H5 AIV in live poultry markets and clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W2621026020,"Background Recent meta-analyses have suggested a modest protective effect of high levels of physical activity on developing both prostate and bladder cancer, but significant heterogeneity between studies included in these meta-analyses existed. To our knowledge, few Chinese studies investigated the association between physical activity and prostate cancer and none between physical activity and bladder cancer. Given the inconsistencies between previous studies and because studies on the relation between physical activity and prostate and bladder cancer in China are scarce, it remains elusive whether there is a relationship between physical activity and prostate and bladder cancer within the Chinese population. Methods We investigated the association between physical activity and risk of developing prostate and bladder cancer within a hospital-based case-control study in the East and South of China among 260 and 438 incident prostate and bladder cancer cases, respectively, and 427 controls. A questionnaire was administered to measure physical activity as metabolic equivalents (METs). Random effects logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) of prostate and bladder cancer for different levels of physical activity and for the specific activities of walking and cycling. Results Increasing overall physical activity was associated with a significant reduction in prostate cancer risk (Ptrend = 0.04) with the highest activity tertile level showing a nearly 50% reduction in prostate cancer risk (OR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.28–0.98). Overall physical activity was not significantly associated with risk of bladder cancer (Ptrend = 0.61), neither were vigorous (Ptrend = 0.60) or moderate levels of physical activity (Ptrend = 0.21). Walking and cycling were not significantly associated with either prostate (Ptrend> = 0.62) or bladder cancer risk (Ptrend> = 0.25). Conclusions The findings of this largest ever case-control study in China investigating the relationship between physical activity and prostate and bladder cancer suggest that overall physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but not with bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2620847870,"Several quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been proposed to investigate microstructural tissue changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetization transfer imaging, and R2* mapping. Here, in this study, we compared these techniques with regard to their capability for detecting ALS related white matter (WM) changes in the brain and their association with clinical findings. We examined 27 ALS patients and 35 age-matched healthy controls. MRI was performed at 3T, after which we analyzed the diffusion properties, the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and the effective transversal relaxation rate R2* in 18 WM tracts that were obtained by a fully automated segmentation technique. ALS patients, especially with a bulbar onset, showed a bilateral increase in radial and mean diffusivity, as well as a reduction in fractional anisotropy of the corticospinal tract (CST), and diffusion changes in the parietal and temporal superior longitudinal fasciculus. A reduction of the MTR was found in both CSTs and an R2* reduction was seen only in the left CST. Tract-specific diffusion properties were not related to clinical status in a cross-sectional manner but demonstrated some association with disease progression over three subsequent months. DTI reveals more widespread WM tissue changes than MTR and R2*. These changes are not restricted to the CST, but affect also other WM tracts (especially in patients with bulbar onset), and are associated with the short term course of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2620941136,"Background Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) is a multi-sectoral approach working to equalize opportunities and include people with disability in all aspects of community life. Reliable and internationally comparable data needed to monitor and evaluate CBR are scarce, partially due to the absence of standardized indicators. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the collaborative development process which led to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recently launched set of standardized CBR outcome indicators. Methods The WHO's CBR Guidelines recognize CBR as a comprehensive and multi-sectoral strategy, and were therefore used as the starting point for the development of the indicators, in a consensus process involving WHO and International Disability and Development Consortium. Pilot implementations in Guatemala, Egypt and China using a specifically developed mobile phone application to collect data, and an online expert survey were completed to assess validity and feasibility of the indicators and their corresponding questions. Results The indicator set includes 13 Base Indicators which are broad enough to capture the situation of people with disability in settings where CBR is carried out, independently of the specific CBR activities carried out in a community; and 27 Supplementary Indicators that provide more specific coverage and can be selected based on the specific goals of a CBR program. Conclusion The indicators were suitable to assess differences in health, education, social life, livelihood and empowerment between people with disability and other community members. This comparability provides valuable information to CBR managers, donors and government agencies, to guide decision making, support advocacy and improve accountability. The CBR indicators will support WHO and its member states in their efforts towards strengthening CBR, by generating evidence on its effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2621061425,"Vanillin is a plant secondary metabolite and has numerous beneficial health applications. Divanillin is the homodimer of vanillin and used as a taste enhancer compound and also a promissory anticancer drug. Here, divanillin was synthesized and studied in the context of its interaction with bovine serum albumin (BSA). We found that divanillin acquires axial chirality when complexed with BSA. This chiroptical property was demonstrated by a strong induced circular dichroism (ICD) signal. In agreement with this finding, the association constant between BSA and divanillin (3.3 x 105 mol-1L) was higher compared to its precursor vanillin (7.3 x 104 mol-1L). The ICD signal was used for evaluation of the association constant, demonstration of the reversibility of the interaction and determination of the binding site, revealing that divanillin has preference for Sudlow’s site I in BSA. This property was confirmed by displacement of the fluorescent markers warfarin (site I) and dansyl-L-proline (site II). Molecular docking simulation confirmed the higher affinity of divanillin to site I. The highest scored conformation obtained by docking (dihedral angle 242°) was used for calculation of the circular dichroism spectrum of divanillin using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT). The theoretical spectrum showed good similarity with the experimental ICD. In summary, we have demonstrated that by interacting with the chiral cavities in BSA, divanillin became a atropos biphenyl, i.e., the free rotation around the single bound that links the aromatic rings was impeded. This phenomenon can be explained considering the interactions of divanillin with amino acid residues in the binding site of the protein. This chiroptical property can be very useful for studying the effects of divanillin in biological systems. Considering the potential pharmacological application of divanillin, these findings will be helpful for researchers interested in the pharmacological properties of this compound."
https://openalex.org/W2621124305,"In Sandhoff disease (SD), the activity of the lysosomal hydrolytic enzyme, β-hexosaminidase (Hex), is lost due to a Hexb gene defect, which results in the abnormal accumulation of the substrate, GM2 ganglioside (GM2), in neuronal cells, causing neuronal loss, microglial activation, and astrogliosis. We established induced pluripotent stem cells from the cells of SD mice (SD-iPSCs). In the present study, we investigated the occurrence of abnormal differentiation and development of a neural lineage in the asymptomatic phase of SD in vitro using SD mouse fetus-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and SD-iPSCs. It was assumed that the number of SD mouse fetal brain-derived NSCs was reduced and differentiation was promoted, resulting in the inhibition of differentiation into neurons and enhancement of differentiation into astrocytes. The number of SD-iPSC-derived NSCs was also reduced, suggesting that the differentiation of NSCs was promoted, resulting in the inhibition of differentiation into neurons and enhancement of that into astrocytes. This abnormal differentiation of SD-iPSCs toward a neural lineage was reduced by the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, miglustat. Furthermore, abnormal differentiation toward a neural lineage was reduced in SD-iPSCs with Hexb gene transfection. Therefore, differentiation ability along the time axis appears to be altered in SD mice in which the differentiation ability of NSCs is promoted and differentiation into neurons is completed earlier, while the timing of differentiation into astrocytes is accelerated. These results clarified that the abnormal differentiation of SD-iPSCs toward a neural lineage in vitro was shown to reflect the pathology of SD."

We conducted a cross-sectional pilot study to investigate how best to study ethnic differences in lung function in young adults and evaluate whether these could be explained by birth weight and socio-economic factors. Methods We recruited 112 university students of White and South Asian British ethnicity, measured post-bronchodilator lung function, obtained information on respiratory symptoms and socio-economic factors through questionnaires, and acquired birth weight through data linkage. We regressed lung function against ethnicity and candidate predictors defined a priori using linear regression, and used penalised regression to examine a wider range of factors. We reviewed the implications of our findings for the feasibility of a larger study. Results There was a similar parental socio-economic environment and no difference in birth weight between the two ethnic groups, but the ethnic difference in FVC adjusted for sex, age, height, demi-span, father’s occupation, birth weight, maternal educational attainment and maternal upbringing was 0.81L (95%CI: -1.01 to -0.54L). Difference in body proportions did not explain the ethnic differences although parental immigration was an important predictor of FVC independent of ethnic group. Participants were comfortable with study procedures and we were able to link birth weight data to clinical measurements. Conclusion Studies of ethnic disparities in lung function among young adults are feasible. Future studies should recruit a socially more diverse sample and investigate the role of markers of acculturation in explaining such differences."

Using immortalized human myometrial (hTERT-HM) cells stably expressing wild-type PR-A or PR-B (PRWT), we found that P4 significantly inhibited IL-1β induction of the NF-κB target genes, COX-2 and IL-8. P4–PRWT transrepression occurred at the level of transcription initiation and was mediated by decreased recruitment of NF-κB p65 and RNA polymerase II to COX-2 and IL-8 promoters.

ChIP analysis of hTERT-HM cells stably expressing PRWT or PRmDBD revealed that P4 treatment caused equivalent recruitment of PRWT and PRmDBD to COX-2 and IL-8 promoters, suggesting that PR inhibitory effects were not mediated by its direct DNA binding. Using immunoprecipitation, followed by MS, we identified a transcriptional repressor, GATA zinc finger domain–containing 2B (GATAD2B), that interacted strongly with PRWT but poorly with PRmDBD.

Classically, binding of P4 to PR induces conformational changes in PR, followed by its dimerization and translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it either directly binds to progesterone response elements in PR target gene promoters or tethers to other transcription factors bound to their respective response elements in the promoter regions of target genes to modulate their transcriptional activity.

Bellward G.D. Serum progesterone levels in the pregnant and postpartum laboratory mouse.Endocrinology. 1974; 95: 1486-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) led to the concept that term labor is associated with P4 withdrawal. However, in humans and guinea pigs, circulating P4 levels remain elevated throughout pregnancy and into labor, as do myometrial levels of PR (20Challis J.R.G. Matthews S.G. Gibb W. Lye S.J. Endocrine and paracrine regulation of birth at term and preterm.Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 514-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Notably, even in mice, maternal P4 levels at term remain well above the Kd for binding to PR (21Pointis G. Rao B. Latreille M.T. Mignot T.M. Cedard L.

These findings have led to the concept that parturition in all species is initiated by a concerted series of biochemical events that act to impair PR function and antagonize its ability to maintain myometrial quiescence.

However, the details of how these mechanisms are integrated to orchestrate the functional withdrawal of P4–PR during late gestation remain unknown. To better understand the mechanism(s) responsible for the decline of PR function prior to labor at term, in the present study, we observed that the DNA-binding motif of PR plays an important role in P4-mediated inhibition of endogenous proinflammatory genes. We further observed that transrepressive activity of P4–PR occurred at the level of transcription initiation and was mediated by decreased recruitment of NF-κB p65 and RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) to the COX-2 and IL-8 promoter regions. Thus, we postulated that nuclear proteins interacting with the PR DNA-binding motif may play an important role in P4–PR–mediated transrepression. Using mass spectrometry to identify proteins that differentially interacted with PRWT versus the PRDBD mutants, we identified a transcriptional repressor, GATAD2B, which interacted with the PR DNA-binding motif and served an important role in P4–PR suppression of proinflammatory and CAP gene expression during pregnancy. We propose that during late gestation, a decrease in GATAD2B expression contributes to the decline in PR function and thereby contributes to the initiation of labor at term. To further define mechanisms underlying P4–PR–mediated anti-inflammatory responses, we first identified the functional domain(s) of PR important for these effects using transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. HEK-293 cells were used because they are easily transfectable and lack endogenous PR but contain cofactors required for transcriptional activity of transfected steroid receptors. Because sumoylation of nuclear receptors has been shown to play an important role in anti-inflammatory activity (30Glass C.K. Saijo K.

Previously, it was reported that the PR DBD contributed to P4–PR transrepressive activity on NF-κB p65-mediated transactivation in transfected cells; when the entire DBD was deleted, the P4–PR–mediated repressive activity was lost (2Kalkhoven E. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Negative interaction between the RelA(p65) subunit of NF-κB and the progesterone receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6217-6224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). To avoid causing major changes in PR structure, in the present study, we generated point mutations in two functional motifs within the DBD of PR. These included PR-B A604T, a point mutation in the D-box of the DBD, important for receptor dimerization, and PR-BmDBD, a triple mutation of the P-box, required for direct DNA binding (34Quiles I. Millán-Ariño L. Subtil-Rodríguez A. Miñana B. Spinedi N. Ballaré C. Beato M. Jordan A. Mutational analysis of progesterone receptor functional domains in stable cell lines delineates sets of genes regulated by different mechanisms.Mol. Endocrinol. 2009; 23: 809-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To test PR transrepression activity, an NF-κB–mediated reporter assay was used. As shown in Fig. 1A, when HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing five NF-κB consensus binding sites, treatment with IL-1β significantly induced luciferase activity compared with vehicle. Treatment with IL-1β + P4 did not affect luciferase activity because PR is not expressed in the HEK-293 cells. When cells were cotransfected with wild-type PR-B (PR-BWT) expression vector and reporter plasmids, treatment with P4 + IL-1β caused a significant decrease in luciferase activity compared with IL-1β alone. By contrast, in cells cotransfected with PR-BmDBD, P4-mediated repressive activity was completely lost. Whereas in cells cotransfected with expression vectors for PR-B mutants K388R or PR-B A604T, P4 repression of IL-1β-induced luciferase activity was still evident, the -fold repression was reduced significantly compared with the effects of PR-BWT (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these findings suggest that the sumoylation site, dimerization site, and DNA-binding motif of PR may play a role in P4 repression of NF-κB-mediated transcription. However, PR transrepression activity was most severely disrupted by mutation of the PR DNA-binding motif. To further study transrepressive efficacy of the PR-A isoform and effects of DBD mutations, HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding either PR-AWT, PR-BWT, or the corresponding DBD mutants. As can be seen in Fig. 1, C and D, when cells expressed PR-AWT or PR-BWT, co-treatment with P4 significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced luciferase activity to a similar extent. As observed for PR-BmDBD, mutation of the PR-A DBD (PR-AmDBD) completely blocked transrepression activity. To confirm that P4–PR–mediated repression of NF-κB activity was direct, rather than through an indirect mechanism, such as induction of IκBα (15Hardy D.B. Janowski B.A. Corey D.R. Mendelson C.R. Progesterone receptor (PR) plays a major anti-inflammatory role in human myometrial cells by antagonism of NF-κB activation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression.Mol.

Physiologic uterine inflammation and labor onset: integration of endocrine and mechanical signals.Reprod. Sci. 2013; 20: 154-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), a mammalian one-hybrid reporter assay was used. Using this assay, HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with Gal4–p65 CTD expression vector (35Li H. Wittwer T. Weber A. Schneider H. Moreno R. Maine G.N. Kracht M. Schmitz M.L. Burstein E. Regulation of NF-κB activity by competition between RelA acetylation and ubiquitination.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), encoding a chimeric protein comprised of the C-terminal transactivation domain (amino acids 286–551) of NF-κB p65 fused to the DBD of Gal4, a GAL4 luciferase reporter, and PRWT or PRmDBD expression vectors. The Gal4 DBD, containing a nuclear localization sequence, binds to Gal4-binding sites; luciferase activity is transactivated via the p65 transactivation domain. As shown in Fig. 1E, treatment with P4 significantly repressed luciferase activity compared with vehicle when cells were cotransfected either with PR-BWT or PR-AWT expression vectors. By contrast, cotransfection of PR-BmDBD or PR-AmDBD expression vectors failed to exert transrepressive activity. These data suggest that P4–PR directly repressed p65 transactivation and that the PR DNA-binding motif plays an important role in transrepression activity. To evaluate the roles of PR-A and PR-B and their DNA-binding motifs in P4-mediated repression of endogenous proinflammatory and CAP gene expression, we utilized immortalized human myometrial cells (hTERT-HM) that lack endogenous PR to develop cell lines stably expressing either GFP alone or GFP-conjugated PR-BWT or PR-AWT or their corresponding DNA-binding domain mutants (PRmDBD) (Fig. 2A). These cells maintain characteristics of myometrial smooth muscle cells (36Condon J. Yin S. Mayhew B. Word R.A. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Rainey W.E.

As shown in the representative immunoblot (Fig. 2B), PR expression levels in the four genetically modified stable hTERT-HM cell lines were comparable. mRNA levels of proinflammatory and CAP genes in the cell lines cultured in the absence or presence of IL-1β with or without P4 for 2 h were analyzed by RT-qPCR. As shown in Fig. 3, in cells stably expressing either PR-BWT or PR-AWT, co-treatment with P4 significantly reduced IL-1β-induced COX-2 and IL-8 expression (Fig. 3, A and E), compared with IL-1β alone. Although both PR-BWT and PR-AWT had the capacity to repress COX-2 and IL-8 expression, the repressive activity mediated by PR-BWT was significantly greater than that of PR-AWT (Fig. 3, B and F). In cells stably expressing the PR-BmDBD mutant, P4-mediated repression activity was significantly reduced compared with cells expressing PR-BWT, whereas in cells expressing the PR-AmDBD mutant, P4 no longer could repress IL-1β–induced COX-2 and IL-8 mRNA expression (Fig. 3, B and F). Similar findings were obtained for endogenous mRNA expression of the proinflammatory genes, CCL-2 and IL-6 (data not shown). To determine whether the P4–PR–mediated transrepression activity occurred at the level of transcription initiation, the uridine analogue, 5-ethynyl uridine (EU), was used to label and isolate newly synthesized nascent RNA; levels of heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) were analyzed by RT-qPCR. The hTERT-HM cells stably transfected with GFP conjugates of PR-AWT, PR-BWT, or the corresponding DBD mutants were cultured for only 40 min with or without IL-1β and with or without P4 to ensure that the level of hnRNA for a given gene was representative of transcriptional initiation. When cells were treated with IL-1β alone, COX-2 (Fig. 3C) and IL-8 (Fig. 3G) hnRNA levels were significantly increased compared with vehicle-treated cells. In both PR-BWT– and PR-AWT–expressing cells, co-treatment with P4 significantly reduced COX-2 and IL-8 hnRNA levels (Fig. 3, C and G) suggesting that P4–PR inhibition of IL-1β-induced expression is at the level of transcription initiation. In cells expressing PR-BmDBD, P4 retained its ability to repress transcription initiation, but transrepression activity was significantly reduced compared with cells expressing PRWT (Fig. 3, D and H). However, in PR-AmDBD–expressing cells, P4 completely lost its ability to repress transcription (Fig. 3, D and H). Taken together, P4–PR-mediated transrepression activity occurs at the level of transcription initiation, and the DNA-binding motif of PR appears to play a critical role. Moreover, PR-B appears to have more profound transrepressive activity than PR-A on IL-1β–mediated activation of proinflammatory gene expression. Because levels of PR expression in the four genetically modified hTERT-HM cell lines were comparable (Fig. 2B), the decreased repressive activities of PR-BmDBD, PR-AWT, and PR-AmDBD relative to PR-BWT cannot be attributed to differences in PR expression. To further define the mechanisms whereby P4–PR represses transcription of proinflammatory genes in human myometrial cells, ChIP was used to analyze the effects of IL-1β with or without P4 on recruitment of RNA Pol II, NF-κB p65, and PR to the COX-2 and IL-8 promoters. hTERT-HM cells stably expressing GFP or GFP conjugates of PR-AWT and PR-BWT and corresponding DBD mutants were cultured with or without IL-1β and with or without P4 for 40 min. In all cell lines, IL-1β significantly stimulated recruitment of RNA Pol II to a genomic region surrounding the COX-2 (Fig. 4A) and IL-8 (Fig. 4B) transcription start sites (TSS); co-treatment with P4 significantly decreased recruitment of RNA Pol II in cells stably expressing PR-BWT, PR-AWT, and PR-BmDBD. However, in cells expressing PR-AmDBD, P4 failed to inhibit recruitment of RNA Pol II (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar effects were observed for recr"

https://openalex.org/W2620761453,"Background The prevalence of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) has been proposed to be elevated in the patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Our aims were to determine the prevalence of NF1 in a large Finnish population based cohort of IA patients and, on the other hand, the occurrences of subarachnoid haemorrhage and unruptured intracranial aneurysms in a nationwide population-based cohort of NF1 patients and its matched ten-fold control cohort. Methods The Kuopio IA Database (www.kuopioneurosurgery.fi) includes all ruptured and unruptured IA cases admitted to the Kuopio University Hospital (KUH) from its defined Eastern Finnish catchment population since 1980. In this registry-based study, we cross-linked the Kuopio IA database with the Finnish national registry covering all hospital diagnoses. The NF1 diagnoses of the 4543 patients with either saccular of fusiform IA were identified from 1969 to 2015 and verified from patient records. Our second approach was to analyze the occurrence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) and unruptured IAs in a nationwide population-based database of 1410 NF1 patients and its ten-fold matched control cohort (n = 14030) using national registry of hospital diagnoses between 1987 and 2014. Results One NF1 patient was identified among the 4543 IA patients. Three verified IA cases (one unruptured IA and two aSAH cases) were identified in the cohort of 1410 NF1 patients, with similar occurrences in the control cohort. Conclusions We found no evidence in our population-based cohorts to support the conception that NF1 is associated with IAs. Our results indicate that the incidence of aSAH is not elevated in patients with NF1. Further studies are required to confirm that there is no association between NF1 and unruptured IAs."

In this study nonlinear mixed-effects pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation was used to investigate caspofungin pharmacokinetics and explore dosing regimens in cats using caspofungin minimum effective concentrations (MECs). Plasma concentrations in healthy cats were determined using HPLC-MS/MS after administration of a single and seven consecutive daily intravenous doses of 1 mg/kg caspofungin. In the final pharmacokinetic model an optimum maximum concentration (Cmax): MEC ratio of 10-20 was used to guide caspofungin efficacy. Simulations were performed for dosing regimens (doses 0.25-2 mg/kg and 6-72 h dosing intervals) with and without inclusion of a loading dose. Using a 1 mg/kg dose Cmax first dose was 14.8 μg/mL, Cmax at steady state was 19.8 μg/mL, Cmin was 5 μg/mL and Cmax: MEC was >20 in 42.6% of cats after multiple doses. An optimal Cmax: MEC ratio was achieved in caspofungin simulations using 0.75 mg/kg q 24 h or 1 mg/kg q 72h. However, at 1 mg/kg q 72h, Cmin was < MEC (<1 μg/mL) in over 95% of the population. Using a loading dose of 1 mg/kg and a daily dose of 0.75 mg/kg thereafter, the Cmax: MEC was optimal and Cmin was > 2.5 μg/mL for 98% of the population. Based on the modeling data this dosing regimen is likely to achieve target therapeutic concentrations, meet the proposed Cmax: MEC window and provide consistent exposure between doses."
https://openalex.org/W2620720819,"Withania somnifera is a high value medicinal plant which is used against large number of ailments. The medicinal properties of the plant attributes to a wide array of important secondary metabolites. The plant is predominantly infected with leaf spot pathogen Alternaria alternata, which leads to substantial biodeterioration of pharmaceutically important metabolites. To develop an effective strategy to combat this disease, proteomics based approach could be useful. Hence, in the present study, three different protein extraction methods tris-buffer based, phenol based and trichloroacetic acid-acetone (TCA-acetone) based method were comparatively evaluated for two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis of W. somnifera. TCA-acetone method was found to be most effective and was further used to identify differentially expressed proteins in response to fungal infection. Thirty-eight differentially expressed proteins were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF MS/MS). The known proteins were categorized into eight different groups based on their function and maximum proteins belonged to energy and metabolism, cell structure, stress and defense and RNA/DNA categories. Differential expression of some key proteins were also crosschecked at transcriptomic level by using qRT-PCR and were found to be consistent with the 2-DE data. These outcomes enable us to evaluate modifications that take place at the proteomic level during a compatible host pathogen interaction. The comparative proteome analysis conducted in this paper revealed the involvement of many key proteins in the process of pathogenesis and further investigation of these identified proteins could assist in the discovery of new strategies for the development of pathogen resistance in the plant."

While the emphasis of experimental work so far was on the developmental period, we focus here on disease mechanisms that induce progression into severe adult disease. The goal of this study was the comprehensive analysis of the long-term effects of the absence of Norrin on vascular homeostasis and retinal function. In a mouse model of Norrie disease retinal vascular morphology and integrity were studied by means of in vivo angiography; the vascular constituents were assessed in detailed histological analyses using quantitative retinal morphometry. Finally, electroretinographic analyses were performed to assess the retinal function in adult Norrin deficient animals. We could show that the primary developmental defects not only persisted but developed into further vascular abnormalities and microangiopathies. In particular, the overall vessel homeostasis, the vascular integrity, and also the cellular constituents of the vascular wall were affected in the adult Norrin deficient retina. Moreover, functional analyses indicated to persistent hypoxia in the neural retina which was suggested as one of the major driving forces of disease progression. In summary, our data provide evidence that the key to adult Norrie disease are ongoing vascular modifications, driven by the persistent hypoxic conditions, which are ineffective to compensate for the primary Norrin-dependent defects."
https://openalex.org/W2621026031,"With age, the trip to -your doctor for the annual physical check-up can be a daunting one. A perfect blood and lipid profile during youth slowly caves in to the inevitable process of aging, leading to slow but steady deflections in physiological metrics. For many, an especially surprising result is that of the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and the ratio of its comparison to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc). LDL and HDL are lipoproteins that bind and transport cholesterol in the body. LDL delivers it to cells and HDL drives cholesterol transport away from cells and into the liver. While it is known that a sedentary lifestyle and growing obesity are contributing factors to imbalances in lipid profiles, what is surprising is that often the seemingly fit or lean are also susceptible to increases in LDLc. An increase in cholesterol levels in itself is asymptomatic, but long-term risks include a host of cardiovascular complications. In fact, cardiovascular diseases are the world’s number one cause of death and a major medical problem in both developed and developing countries. The CDC estimates that more than a third of American adults have high LDL levels and of these, only a third are able to control it in some way. Diet and exercise are of course useful measures; however, patients that are genetically predisposed to hypercholesterolemia or other cardiovascular complications require additional clinical options. Since the late 80s, drugs known as statins have been at the forefront of cholesterol-reduction efforts. Statins target the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is a key rate-limiting factor in cholesterol synthesis. Various versions of the drug have been shown to not just directly lower LDL levels but also strongly reduce cardiovascular disease-associated complications as well as deaths (Reiner, 2013Reiner Ž. Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2013; 10: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). While largely considered to be safe, some patients experience side effects such as myopathy or show limited to no benefit with statin medication (Dadu and Ballantyne, 2014Dadu R.T. Ballantyne C.M. Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2014; 11: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, large-scale genetic studies have linked elevated LDL cholesterol levels as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, identifying specific genes such as LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 as possibly playing a direct role (Lange et al., 2014Lange L.A. Hu Y. Zhang H. Xue C. Schmidt E.M. Tang Z.Z. Bizon C. Lange E.M. Smith J.D. Turner E.H. et al.NHLBI Grand Opportunity Exome Sequencing ProjectAm. J. Hum. Genet. 2014; 94: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PCSK9 was found through genetic studies documenting familial hypercholesterolemia and molecular studies that characterized it as a member of the proprotein convertase family of serine proteases that play a role in a range of metabolic, infectious, and neurodegenerative diseases (Artenstein and Opal, 2011Artenstein A.W. Opal S.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In humans, PCSK9 is primarily expressed in the liver, intestine, kidney, and brain, though recent studies have detected its expression in other tissues as well (Artenstein and Opal, 2011Artenstein A.W. Opal S.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Secreted PCSK9 binds to the LDL receptor and targets it for lysosomal degradation. With fewer LDL receptors expressed at the cell surface to bind circulating LDL cholesterol, overall LDL levels rise. Loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 thus result in reduced LDL cholesterol levels and it is therefore not surprising that this protein emerged as a potentially interesting and promising therapeutic target for the control of hypercholesterolemia and its associated complications (Dullaart, 2017Dullaart R.P.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 1790-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In 2008, a study showed that siRNA nanoparticles could be used to knock down PCSK9 in rodent and non-human primate models and that this resulted in a marked reduction in overall LDL cholesterol levels, without affecting HDL or triglycerides (Frank-Kamenetsky et al., 2008Frank-Kamenetsky M. Grefhorst A. Anderson N.N. Racie T.S. Bramlage B. Akinc A. Butler D. Charisse K. Dorkin R. Fan Y. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 11915-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Earlier this year, a phase 1 trial used a similar approach testing the effect of inclisiran, a lipid nanoparticle containing siRNAs against human PCSK9 (Fitzgerald et al., 2017Fitzgerald K. White S. Borodovsky A. Bettencourt B.R. Strahs A. Clausen V. Wijngaard P. Horton J.D. Taubel J. Brooks A. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A range of concentrations and dose regiments were tested in a small cohort of 69 patients that all had LDL levels of 100 mg/dL, which is considered just above optimal. Interestingly, patients that received a subcutaneous single dose of 300 mg or more of inclisiran showed almost a 60% reduction in LDL cholesterol for up to 84 days, suggesting that on a practical level, patients would need a dose only every few months (Fitzgerald et al., 2017Fitzgerald K. White S. Borodovsky A. Bettencourt B.R. Strahs A. Clausen V. Wijngaard P. Horton J.D. Taubel J. Brooks A. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, what has not been clear in the field is whether lowered LDL cholesterol levels alone are an indicative metric to suggest long-term cardiovascular benefits and how predictive these observed effects in the trials really are to prevent complications such as stroke, atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction. Humanized antibodies against PCSK9 such as evolocumab and alirocumab have provided the other therapeutic leads in this field (Natarajan and Kathiresan, 2016Natarajan P. Kathiresan S. Cell. 2016; 165: 1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By binding extracellular PCSK9 and preventing its interaction with the LDL receptor, these antibodies have demonstrated up to a 61% reduction in levels in patients (Dullaart, 2017Dullaart R.P.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 1790-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the question of what this means for long-term cardiovascular protection remained unexplored. Now a trial with nearly 27,000 patients across 49 countries over a 2 year period has helped to address whether subcutaneous evolocumab administration could provide benefits beyond lowering LDL levels. Besides a 59% reduction in LDL levels, the authors noted a decrease in the cumulative incidence of several cardiovascular events including myocardial infraction, stroke, angina, and even death after a 2 year follow up. The authors thus conclude that there are indeed long-term benefits, though whether this therapy is clearly preventive for developing cardiovascular disease remains to be seen (Sabatine et al., 2017Sabatine M.S. Giugliano R.P. Keech A.C. Honarpour N. Wiviott S.D. Murphy S.A. Kuder J.F. Wang H. Liu T. Wasserman S.M. et al.FOURIER Steering Committee and InvestigatorsN. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (3197) Google Scholar). In both, the RNAi and antibody therapy studies, the majority of the patients were also taking statins. While not exactly additive, there seems to be some synergy between statins and anti-PCSK9 therapeutics in terms overall benefit. Further, the authors of the recent evolocumab study note that there is a need for more long-term follow up to see what the effects of lower LDLc levels are in terms of cardiovascular disease protection, given that prior trials with statins and other drugs have shown that a longer window is needed to really see the effects on myocardial infarction, stroke, and related death (Sabatine et al., 2017Sabatine M.S. Giugliano R.P. Keech A.C. Honarpour N. Wiviott S.D. Murphy S.A. Kuder J.F. Wang H. Liu T. Wasserman S.M. et al.FOURIER Steering Committee and InvestigatorsN. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (3197) Google Scholar). Importantly though, little if any complications or major side effects have been observed in the various studies targeting PCSK9 in animal models and humans. Together, these recent studies provide new and exciting therapeutic promise toward tackling the biggest non-infectious source of death worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2620895091,"The number of new dialysis patients has been increasing worldwide, particularly among elderly individuals. However, information on seasonal variation in hemodialysis initiation in recent decades is lacking, and the seasonal distribution of patients’ conditions immediately prior to starting dialysis remains unclear. Having this information could help in developing a modifiable approach to improving pre-dialysis care. We retrospectively investigated the records of 297 patients who initiated hemodialysis at Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital from January 1st, 2009 to December 31st, 2013. Seasonal differences were assessed by χ2 or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Multiple comparison analysis was performed with the Steel test. The overall number of patients starting dialysis was greatest in winter (n = 85, 28.6%), followed by spring (n = 74, 24.9%), summer (n = 70, 23.6%), and autumn (n = 68, 22.9%), though the differences were not significant. However, there was a significant winter peak in dialysis initiation among patients aged ≥65 years, but not in those aged <65 years. Fluid overload assessed by clinicians was the most common uremic symptom among all patients, but a winter peak was only detected in patients aged ≥65 years. The body weight gain ratio showed a similar trend to fluid overload assessed by clinicians. Pulmonary edema was most pronounced in winter among patients aged ≥65 years compared with other seasons. The incidences of infection were modestly increased in summer and winter, but not statistically significant. Cardiac complications were similar in all seasons. This study demonstrated the existence of seasonal variation in dialysis initiation, with a winter peak among patients aged ≥65 years. The winter increment in dialysis initiation was mainly attributable to increased fluid overload. These findings suggest that elderly individuals should be monitored particularly closely during the winter."
https://openalex.org/W2620746405,Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis begins with the co-transcriptional assembly of the 90S pre-ribosome. The ‘U three protein’ (UTP) complexes and snoRNP particles arrange around the nascent pre-ribosomal RNA chaperoning its folding and further maturation. The earliest event in this hierarchical process is the binding of the UTP-A complex to the 5'-end of the pre-ribosomal RNA (5'-ETS). This oligomeric complex predominantly consists of β-propeller and α-solenoidal proteins. Here we present the structure of the Utp4 subunit from the thermophilic fungus Chaetomium thermophilum at 2.15 Å resolution and analyze its function by UV RNA-crosslinking (CRAC) and in context of a recent cryo-EM structure of the 90S pre-ribosome. Utp4 consists of two orthogonal and highly basic β-propellers that perfectly fit the EM-data. The Utp4 structure highlights an unusual Velcro-closure of its C-terminal β-propeller as relevant for protein integrity and potentially Utp8 recognition in the context of the pre-ribosome. We provide a first model of the 5'-ETS RNA from the internally hidden 5'-end up to the region that hybridizes to the 3'-hinge sequence of U3 snoRNA and validate a specific Utp4/5'-ETS interaction by CRAC analysis.

Prolonged NO exposure irreversibly inhibits respiration by covalent modification of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, a phenomenon of pathological relevance. However, the speed and potency of NO's metabolic effects at physiological concentrations are incompletely characterized. To this end, we set out to investigate the metabolic effects of NO in cultured astrocytes from mice by taking advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution afforded by genetically encoded Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensors. Full-Text PDF Open Access Astrocytes make up a large part of the human brain, and because of their many processes, extended feet that attach to axons, dendrites, and capillaries in the brain, they sometimes appear to be star-shaped. However, their reputation as the stars of the brain also derives from the fact that they play a key role in numerous physiological processes and are intimately coupled with neuronal function and metabolism (1Oberheim N.A. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. Heterogeneity of astrocytic form and function.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 814: 23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 2Schousboe A. Bak L.K. Waagepetersen H.S. Astrocytic control of biosynthesis and turnover of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA.Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2013; 4: 102Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); so intimately, in fact, that we in our lab sometimes refer to neurons as AHCs, astrocyte helper cells. Ever since Pellerin and Magistretti made the suggestion in 1994 (3Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. Glutamate uptake into astrocytes stimulates aerobic glycolysis: A mechanism coupling neuronal activity to glucose utilization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10625-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar) that astrocytes provide lactate as metabolic fuel for neurons, there has been much interest in how astrocyte energy metabolism is regulated. Answering this question has both fundamental and practical importance; for example, interpretation of positron emission tomography imaging signals from fluorodeoxyglucose depends on our understanding of the underlying cellular activity dictating the measured responses. While the overall topic of astrocyte-neuron coupling via the lactate pool is controversial, being debated at every conference in the field and in the literature (e.g. Refs. 4Bak L.K. Schousboe A.

Blood Flow Metab. 2012; 32: 1152-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), other basic questions regarding astrocyte metabolism remain unresolved. In this context, San Martín et al. (7San Martin A. Arce-Molina R. Galaz A. Pérez-Guerra G. Barros L.F. Nanomolar nitric oxide concentrations quickly and reversibly modulate astrocytic energy metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 9432-9438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) provide a new clue into possible mechanisms of cellular cross-talk in the brain in their investigation of NO's influence on astrocytes. Blood flow determines the amount of glucose delivered to the brain, and NO originating from endothelial cells is known to be one of several potent signaling molecules involved in the regulation of vascular tone or the extent to which blood vessels are dilated. Glycolysis is the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, and previous work has shown that NO may increase the flow through this pathway, i.e. glycolytic flux, by blocking complex IV, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration and thus induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent phosphorylation of the phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB) 2The abbreviation used is: PFKFBphosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. dual enzyme (8Almeida A. Moncada S. Bolaños J.P. Nitric oxide switches on glycolysis through the AMP protein kinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). What was not clear at that time was whether the effects of NO would be present at nanomolar rather than micromolar levels (i.e. closer to what may be physiological) of NO, and whether these effects were readily reversible. phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. The authors test these questions using a range of approaches. First, employing mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes, the authors confirm that a 1-min exposure to 2 μm NO induces an immediate decrease in the glucose level and an increase in the level of lactate; both were fully reversible within a couple of minutes after removal of NO from the buffer. In this assay, a decrease in the cytosolic level of glucose is interpreted as an increase in glycolytic flux. Next, the authors investigated whether the effect of NO on cytosolic glucose levels would be more pronounced at a lower level of O2, since that would indicate that mitochondrial respiration via complex IV was involved in the mechanism, and not other targets of NO that are not directly dependent on respiration. This was indeed the case, and at the lower level of O2, the recovery back to baseline upon withdrawal of NO was slower. In some cells, prolonged exposure to 2 μm NO (3 min) even caused a persistent decrease in cytosolic glucose levels consistent with continuing inhibition of complex IV, possibly by nitrosylation. However, whether the activity of PFKFB is involved in the mechanism, as suggested previously (8Almeida A. Moncada S. Bolaños J.P. Nitric oxide switches on glycolysis through the AMP protein kinase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), was not explored in this investigation. One drawback of employing the glucose biosensor is that it reports free, non-phosphorylated glucose levels, not glycolytic flux per se; thus, other changes to glucose concentration, such as from glucose transporter activity or changes in glycogen metabolism, may influence the read-out. The authors performed experiments in the presence of a blocker of glucose transport to rule out this complication. Under this experimental condition, the authors found significant effects of as low as 100 nm NO in some cells suggesting that nanomolar levels of NO may indeed modulate glycolytic flux (or glycogen metabolism); future work to deconvolute the influence of glycogen metabolism will be a welcome addition to this line of research. In a second experiment, the authors employed a biosensor that measures cytosolic levels of pyruvate, the direct precursor of lactate, and switched the buffer to contain only pyruvate as substrate. After establishing a steady-state level of cytosolic pyruvate (i.e. uptake and mitochondrial consumption is presumed to match), a blocker of cellular uptake of pyruvate was introduced, and the disappearance of pyruvate was monitored and assumed to correspond to mitochondrial consumption. In some cells, the decrease in pyruvate was curbed by the presence of as low as 50 nm NO, suggesting that NO at these low levels inhibits consumption of pyruvate consistent with inhibition of respiration. The work by San Martín et al. (7San Martin A. Arce-Molina R. Galaz A. Pérez-Guerra G. Barros L.F. Nanomolar nitric oxide concentrations quickly and reversibly modulate astrocytic energy metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 9432-9438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) provides a proof-of-principle that NO at nanomolar levels, presumed to be within the physiological range, can reversibly increase cellular glycolytic flux by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. As mentioned above, further work is needed on this topic to determine whether the mechanism involves PFKFB or glycogen metabolism. In addition to these data, the authors put forward a proposal for the functional significance of their observations. Because astrocytes themselves do not express any of the known isoforms of nitric-oxide synthases, whereas both endothelial cells and neurons do, they appear to be targets rather than producers of NO. This prompts the authors to suggest that NO released from endothelial cells during increased blood flow in turn spares O2 for use in neurons and increases glycolytic flux and lactate production in astrocytes and that this aids in maintaining an extracellular lactate pool available to neurons (Fig. 1). As hinted above, the existence of this pool is in itself controversial because, among other factors, there is disagreement as to whether there is a unidirectional flow of lactate in the intact brain (a necessary component of the lactate shuttle hypothesis). At the moment, therefore, any regulatory role of endothelial NO on astrocyte energy metabolism remains an open question. There is an intriguing putative link between endothelial NO production through dilation of blood vessels and thus an elevated supply of glucose to the brain to an increase in glycolytic flux and production of lactate in astrocytes. While San Martín et al. (7San Martin A. Arce-Molina R. Galaz A. Pérez-Guerra G. Barros L.F. Nanomolar nitric oxide concentrations quickly and reversibly modulate astrocytic energy metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 9432-9438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) has provided proof-of-principle that NO regulates astrocyte glycolysis, experimentation employing the emerging imaging systems surgically attached to behaving animals will ultimately be needed to fully resolve this question. Finally, we and others (9Satrústegui J. Bak L.K. Fluctuations in cytosolic calcium regulate the neuronal malate-aspartate NADH shuttle: Implications for neuronal energy metabolism.Neurochem. Res. 2015; 40: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have also observed a form of activity-dependent reversible increase in glycolysis and lactate production in neurons albeit via a different mechanism. Thus, an alternative to the lactate shuttle hypothesis could be that both neurons and astrocytes produce lactate during brain activation and that this lactate pool can then be metabolized at a later point by both cell types (and maybe other cells) or dispersed within the brain parenchyma. However the story of neuronal coupling ends, these new data from San Martín et al. (7San Martin A. Arce-Molina R. Galaz A. Pérez-Guerra G. Barros L.F.
