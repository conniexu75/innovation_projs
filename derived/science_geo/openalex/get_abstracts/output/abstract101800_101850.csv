https://openalex.org/W1974572661,"The high resolution three-dimensional x-ray structure of the metal sites of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase is reported. Cytochrome c oxidase is the largest membrane protein yet crystallized and analyzed at atomic resolution. Electron density distribution of the oxidized bovine cytochrome c oxidase at 2.8 A resolution indicates a dinuclear copper center with an unexpected structure similar to a [2Fe-2S]-type iron-sulfur center. Previously predicted zinc and magnesium sites have been located, the former bound by a nuclear encoded subunit on the matrix side of the membrane, and the latter situated between heme a3 and CuA, at the interface of subunits I and II. The O2 binding site contains heme a3 iron and copper atoms (CuB) with an interatomic distance of 4.5 A; there is no detectable bridging ligand between iron and copper atoms in spite of a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between them. A hydrogen bond is present between a hydroxyl group of the hydroxyfarnesylethyl side chain of heme a3 and an OH of a tyrosine. The tyrosine phenol plane is immediately adjacent and perpendicular to an imidazole group bonded to CuB, suggesting a possible role in intramolecular electron transfer or conformational control, the latter of which could induce the redox-coupled proton pumping. A phenyl group located halfway between a pyrrole plane of the heme a3 and an imidazole plane liganded to the other heme (heme a) could also influence electron transfer or conformational control."

By contrast, a patient with selective bilateral damage to the hippocampus failed to acquire the facts but did acquire the conditioning. Finally, a patient with bilateral damage to both amygdala and hippocampal formation acquired neither the conditioning nor the facts. These findings demonstrate a double dissociation of conditioning and declarative knowledge relative to the human amygdala and hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2087172814,"Members of the Rho family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton; Rho controls the assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, Rac regulates actin filament accumulation at the plasma membrane to produce lamellipodia and membrane ruffles, and Cdc42 stimulates the formation of filopodia. When microinjected into quiescent fibroblasts, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 stimulated cell cycle progression through G1 and subsequent DNA synthesis. Furthermore, microinjection of dominant negative forms of Rac and Cdc42 or of the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase blocked serum-induced DNA synthesis. Unlike Ras, none of the Rho GTPases activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that contains the protein kinases c-Raf1, MEK (MAPK or ERK kinase), and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). Instead, Rac and Cdc42, but not Rho, stimulated a distinct MAP kinase, the c-Jun kinase JNK/SAPK (Jun NH2-terminal kinase or stress-activated protein kinase). Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 control signal transduction pathways that are essential for cell growth."

The mutated CDK4 allele was present in autologous cultured melanoma cells and metastasis tissue, but not in the patient's lymphocytes. The mutation, an arginine-to-cysteine exchange at residue 24, was part of the CDK4 peptide recognized by CTLs and prevented binding of the CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4a, but not of p21 or of p27KIP1. The same mutation was found in one additional melanoma among 28 melanomas analyzed. These results suggest that mutation of CDK4 can create a tumor-specific antigen and can disrupt the cell-cycle regulation exerted by the tumor suppressor p16INK4a."

In these mutant mice, the amounts of glycogen synthase messenger RNA were 50 to 70 percent of normal and the transcriptional induction of the genes for two gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase, was delayed. The hepatocytes and adipocytes of the mutant mice failed to accumulate lipid and the expression of the gene for uncoupling protein, the defining marker of brown adipose tissue, was reduced. This study demonstrates that C/EBP alpha is critical for the establishment and maintenance of energy homeostasis in neonates."
https://openalex.org/W2054703295,"Female lions (Panthera leo) showed persistent individual differences in the extent to which they participated in group-territorial conflict. When intergroup encounters were simulated by playback of aggressive vocalizations, some individuals consistently led the approach to the recorded intruder, whereas others lagged behind and avoided the risks of fighting. The lead females recognized that certain companions were laggards but failed to punish them, which suggests that cooperation is not maintained by reciprocity. Modification of the ""odds"" in these encounters revealed that some females joined the group response when they were most needed, whereas other lagged even farther behind. The complexity of these responses emphasizes the great diversity of individual behavior in this species and the inadequacy of current theory to explain cooperation in large groups."
https://openalex.org/W2007962912,"Vulval induction during Caenorhabditis elegans development is mediated by LET-23, a homolog of the mammalian epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase. The sli-1 gene is a negative regulator of LET-23 and is shown here to encode a protein similar to c-Cbl, a mammalian proto-oncoprotein. SLI-1 and c-Cbl share approximately 55 percent amino acid identity over a stretch of 390 residues, which includes a C3HC4 zinc-binding motif known as the RING finger, and multiple consensus binding sites for Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. SLI-1 and c-Cbl may define a new class of proteins that modify receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2007834031,"Decorin and biglycan are structurally related interstitial proteoglycans synthesized in connective tissues like skin, tendon, and cartilage. Despite the conspicuous sequence similarities, where about 55% of the amino acid residues in decorin and biglycan are located in identical positions, the two proteoglycans show differences in their interaction with collagen. Decorin binds to collagen type I, whereas biglycan in several assay systems shows no affinity for this collagen type. Here we have made use of these structural similarities and affinity differences in studies of the collagen binding properties of decorin. Recombinant biglycan/decorin chimeras were produced in mammalian cells and analyzed for their capacity to bind collagen. In the chimeras, biglycan contributes sequences crucial for synthesis and export from the mammalian cells, and decorin provides potential collagen-binding properties. By using this approach we show that decorin binds to the collagen primarily via leucine-rich repeats 4-5 composed of some 40 amino acid residues. Proteoglycan chimeras containing decorin sequences from the N terminus to leucine-rich repeat 3 or sequences from leucine-rich repeat 6 to the C terminus do not show any detectable binding to collagen. A proteoglycan chimera containing decorin leucine-rich repeats 4-5 flanked by biglycan sequences binds to collagen. However, this chimera binds to collagen with somewhat lower affinity than wild type decorin, suggesting that additional low affinity binding sites may be located in other parts of decorin. Alternatively, the conformation of the collagen binding leucine-rich repeats 4-5 are different in decorin and in the biglycan/decorin chimera, leading to a lower collagen affinity for the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2055556021,Lithography can be performed with beams of neutral atoms in metastable excited states to pattern self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiolates on gold. An estimated exposure of a SAM of dodecanethiolate (DDT) to 15 to 20 metastable argon atoms per DDT molecule damaged the SAM sufficiently to allow penetration of an aqueous solution of ferricyanide to the surface of the gold. This solution etched the gold and transformed the patterns in the SAMs into structures of gold; these structures had edge resolution of less than 100 nanometers. Regions of SAMs as large as 2 square centimeters were patterned by exposure to a beam of metastable argon atoms. These observations suggest that this system may be useful in new forms of micro- and nanolithography.

The protein product of the mammalian c-cbl proto-oncogene is a widely expressed cytoplasmic 120-kDa protein (p120cbl) whose normal cellular function has not been determined. Here we show that upon stimulation of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, p120cbl becomes strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with activated EGF receptor in vivo. A GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1-486 of p120cbl, including a region highly conserved in nematodes, binds directly to the autophosphorylated carboxyl-terminal tail of the EGF receptor. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), or nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation also results in tyrosine phosphorylation of p120cbl. Recent genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that Sli-1, a p120cbl homologue, plays a negative regulatory role in control of the Ras signaling pathway initiated by the C. elegans EGF receptor homologue.

https://openalex.org/W2005664398,"We have recently shown that hsp56, the FK506-binding immunophilin component of both the heat shock protein (hsp90•hsp70•hsp56) heterocomplex and the untransformed glucocorticoid receptor heterocomplex, is bound directly to hsp90 (Czar, M.J., Owens-Grillo, J. K., Dittmar, K. D., Hutchison, K. A., Zacharek, A. M., Leach, K. L., Deibel, M. R., and Pratt, W. B.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 11155-11161). In this work, we show that both untransformed glucocorticoid receptor and hsp90 heterocomplexes contain CyP-40, a 40-kDa immunophilin of the cyclosporin A-binding class. CyP-40 is present in both native glucocorticoid receptor heterocomplexes and receptor heterocomplexes reconstituted with rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and the presence of CyP-40 in the receptor heterocomplex is stabilized by molybdate. Immunoadsorption of hsp90 from cell lysate yields coimmunoadsorption of both hsp56 and CyP-40, showing that both immunophilins are in native heterocomplex with hsp90. However, immunoadsorption of hsp56 does not yield coimmunoadsorption of CyP-40; thus, the two immunophilins do not exist in the same heterocomplex with hsp90. Both purified CyP-40 and hsp56 bind directly to purified hsp90, and excess CyP-40 blocks the binding of hsp56, consistent with the presence of a common immunophilin binding site on hsp90. Our data also suggest that there are at least two types of untransformed glucocorticoid receptor-hsp90 heterocomplexes, one that contains hsp56 and another that contains CyP-40. The role played by the immunophilins in steroid receptor action is unknown, but it is clear that the peptidylprolyl isomerase activity of immunophilins is not required for glucocorticoid receptor-hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and proper folding of the hormone binding domain by the hsp90-associated protein folding system of reticulocyte lysate."
https://openalex.org/W2067390157,"The activation of Janus protein-tyrosine kinases (Jaks) and the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of latent signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) are common elements in signal transduction through the cytokine receptor superfamily. To assess the role and specificity of Jaks in Stat activation, we have utilized baculovirus expression systems to produce Stat1 and the Jaks. Co-expression of Stat1 with Tyk2, Jak1, or Jak2 resulted in the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 at Tyr701, the residue phosphorylated in mammalian cells stimulated with interferon γ. Alternatively, Stat1, purified to apparent homogeneity from insect cell extracts, was phosphorylated at Tyr701 in Jak immune complex kinase reactions. Phosphorylation of purified Stat1 was necessary and sufficient for the acquisition of DNA binding activity. The specificity in both systems was indicated by the inability of a Jak2 catalytically inactive mutant (Jak2-Glu882) or the Tec protein-tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate Stat1. However, immune complex-purified epidermal growth factor receptor was capable of phosphorylating purified Stat1 at Tyr701 and activating its DNA binding activity in in vitro reactions.

INTRODUCTIONCellular functions are regulated through the interaction of extracellular ligands with their cognate receptors. One group of ligands, variably termed growth factors, cytokines, or colony-stimulating factors, utilize structurally and functionally similar receptors of the cytokine receptor superfamily(1Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). These receptors couple ligand binding to the activation of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation through their association with members of the Janus protein-tyrosine kinase (Jaks) family (reviewed in (2Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and (3Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar)). The Jak family currently consists of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2, which vary in size from 120-135 kDa. One or more of the Jaks associate with one or more of the cytokine receptor chains at a membrane proximal site of the cytoplasmic domain. The association and activation of Jaks is critical for signaling through these receptors as indicated by the inactivation of receptor function by deletions or point mutations in the receptors that disrupt their ability to associate with the Jaks. A critical role for Jaks in interferon (IFN) 1The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferon(s)EGFRepidermal growth factor receptorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGASinterferon-gamma-activated sequence. signaling has also been established through the identification of cell lines selected for the inability to respond to IFN that lack individual Jaks. In these cells, introduction of the appropriate Jak restores IFN signaling. Lastly, recent studies (4Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 5Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that kinase inactive Jaks can function as dominant negatives in cytokine signaling.The activation of Jaks is required for the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of proteins that are involved in signal transduction. In particular, analysis of receptor mutants has indicated that Jak activation is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Vav, as well as members of the Stat family of proteins. The Stats (signal transducers and activators of transcription) were initially identified in IFN signaling and have been shown to be essential for many of the responses to IFN (reviewed in (6Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4947) Google Scholar)). Individual cytokines induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of one or more of the seven known Stats (Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5a, Stat5b, and Stat6). In the response to IFNα/β, Jak1 and Tyk2 are activated, and Stat1 and Stat2 are subsequently tyrosine-phosphorylated. Following phosphorylation, Stat1 and Stat2 form a complex with a DNA-binding protein, p48, and the complex translocates to the nucleus, binds DNA, and is required for activation of transcription of IFN responsive genes. The absence of any of the components negates the response. In the response to IFNγ, Jak1 and Jak2 are activated, and Stat1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and forms a DNA binding homodimer that translocates to the nucleus and is required for activation of the transcription of IFNγ responsive genes.Although a strong correlation exists between Jak activation and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Stats, there has not been direct evidence to support the hypothesis that the Stats are immediate substrates for the Jaks. Indeed, Stat activation has been seen with other receptor systems, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)(7Fu X. Zhang J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 8Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21933-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the utilization of specific Jaks by individual cytokines and activation of specific Stats have suggested the possibility that individual Jaks may specifically phosphorylate Stats. The studies presented here were designed to address these questions. Using baculovirus expressions systems, we demonstrate that Stat1, either co-expressed with the Jaks or as a purified protein added to immune complex reactions, is a substrate for Jak1, Jak2, or Tyk2. Phosphorylation occurs at the single site previously identified as the in vivo site of tyrosine phosphorylation and as a consequence, Stat1 acquires DNA binding activity. Lastly we demonstrate that Stat1 is similarly a substrate for EGFR but not for the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase Tec.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Expression in Insect CellsInsect SF9 cells were maintained in Grace's insect media. Baculovirus expression vectors were prepared as described previously (10Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R. Ernst T.J. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Jak2-Glu882 was derived from the Jak2 cDNA by introducing a point mutation at codon 882 resulting in its alteration from a lysine to glutamic acid. For expression of proteins in insect cells, SF9 cells were infected with one or more viruses (multiplicity of infection, 5-10). 50-60 h after infection, cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol). Lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and were then used directly for immunoprecipitation or gel mobility shift assays.Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingAntisera specific for Stat1(14Rothman P.

Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20) were obtained from ICN. Rabbit anti-EGFR serum was prepared using the receptor isolated from mouse liver as an antigen (16Cohen S. Fava R.A. Sawyer S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6237-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Specific proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the indicated antiserum and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Precipitated proteins were washed in lysis buffer and were eluted with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Eluted proteins were separated on 7% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Filters were probed using designated sera or antibodies and visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Corp.) as directed by the manufacturer.Stat1 PurificationFor Stat1 purification, SF9 cells infected with Stat1 virus were lysed by sonication in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol. Lysates were passed over a DEAE-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, and the column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-500 mM). Elution fractions containing Stat1 were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and were pooled, concentrated, and subsequently separated on a Sephacryl S-300 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 μM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol. Peak Stat1-containing Sephacryl S-300 fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, pooled, and concentrated for use in in vitro kinase reactions.In Vitro Kinase ReactionsImmune complex Jak kinases were prepared by washing the products of anti-Jak immunoprecipitations in kinase buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 100 μM Na3VO4, 5 mM MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2). For peptide kinase assays, immune complex Jak preparations were suspended in 15 μl of kinase buffer with 1 mg/ml peptide and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated at 25°C for 30 min and then stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Peptides were separated from unincorporated label on 20% gels and visualized by autoradiography. The Tyr701 peptide corresponds to amino acid 695-711 of Stat1 (GPKGTGYIKTELISVS). The Tyr22 peptide corresponds to amino acids 14-29 of Stat1 (FLEQVHQLYDDSFPME).For Stat1 kinase reactions, immune complex Jak kinases were mixed with purified Stat1 (8 μg of protein) in kinase buffer plus 5 mM ATP. Following 30 min of incubation at 25°C, reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a 15 mM final concentration. The products of these reactions were separated by centrifugation into soluble (Stat1) and insoluble (Jak kinase) fractions for use in SDS-PAGE and gel mobility shift assays.EGFR immune complexes were prepared by adding 4 μl of anti-EGFR serum to 1 ml of a centrifuged (12,000 × g for 10 min) 10% homogenate of adult mouse liver prepared with a lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Trition X-1000, 50 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 100 μM sodium vanadate, 0.1 M sodium chloride. After standing for 2 h at 0°C, 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose was added, and incubation, with mixing, was continued for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged, washed three times with 1 ml of homogenizing buffer and stored frozen at −70°C. Before use, the complex was washed once with 1 ml of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 buffer containing 1 mM dithiothreitol.Gel Mobility Shift AssaysFor the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, cell extracts (10 μg of total protein) were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min, followed by a 30-min incubation with 1 ng of Klenow-labeled probe DNA. The probe used (5′-CTAGCAGTGTTTCCCCGAAACACGCTAG-3′) contains a core sequence corresponding to the GAS element found in the interferon regulatory factor 1 promoter. Samples were run on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in 200 mM Tris borate, 2.2 mM EDTA. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography.Phosphopeptide MappingAnalysis of tryptic phosphopeptide was performed as described by Boyle et al.(17Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Briefly, SF9 cells were infected with appropriate viruses and cultured for 60 h. Infected cells were transferred to phosphate-free Grace's media and incubated with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h. Labeled cells were lysed, and Stat1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with Stat1-specific antisera and separation by SDS-PAGE. [32P]Stat1 was identified by autoradiography, isolated from gel slices, and digested with L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma). Tryptic peptides were mixed with a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the Tyr701 peptide of Stat1 (GTGYIK). The peptide mixture was separated in two dimensions on thin layer cellulose plates. 32P-labeled peptides were visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The position of the Tyr701 peptide was determined by ninhydrin staining.RESULTSCytokine-dependent activation of the Jaks is associated with the phosphorylation and activation of one or more of the known Stats. To initially explore the role of the Jaks in Stat phosphorylation, the ability of various Jaks to phosphorylate Stat1 in insect cells was examined. Baculovirus expression constructs were developed for Jak1, Jak2, Tyk2, and a kinase inactive mutant Jak2-Glu882 as well as for Stat1. An expression construct containing the Tec kinase (18Mano H. Ishikawa F. Nishida J. Hirai H. Takaku F. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1781-1786PubMed Google Scholar) was also utilized to determine specificity relative to the Jaks. Each of the wild type kinases was expressed at comparable levels and was tyrosine-phosphorylated constitutively and catalytically active in immune kinase reactions (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 1, when expressed alone, Stat1 was not detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated. However co-expression of Stat1 with Jak1, Jak2, or Tyk2 resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1. Moreover, over several experiments, the levels of phosphorylation with the various Jaks were comparable with the levels of Jak expression, indicating that Stat1 was not preferentially phosphorylated by a particular Jak. The specificity was demonstrated by a lack of Stat1 phosphorylation by the kinase inactive Jak2 mutant (Jak2-Glu882) or by Tec.In the cellular response to IFN, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 occurs on a single residue (Tyr701)(19Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Jaks phosphorylate this site and/or additional sites in Stat1, two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis was done (Fig. 2). Stat1 expressed alone contained a single phosphopeptide that based on the above data is not a phosphotyrosine-containing peptide. When expressed with Jak1, Jak2, or Tyk2, a single additional phosphopeptide was detected. This phosphopeptide co-migrated with a synthetic tryptic peptide containing phosphotyrosine at position Tyr701 (data not shown).Figure 2:Phosphopeptide mapping of Stat1. SF9 cells were infected with Stat1 virus (A) or co-infected with virus for Stat1 and Tyk2 (B), Stat1 and Jak1 (C), or Stat1 and Jak2 (D). 60 h after infection, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Subsequently, Stat1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE separation. Tryptic peptides of the isolated Stat1 were prepared and mixed with a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the predicted Tyr701 peptide of Stat1. Separation was performed in two dimensions, and labeled phosphopeptides were visualized using a PhosphorImager. The positions of the synthetic peptides were determined by ninhydrin staining and are indicated by the broken circles. The origin of separation is indicated by the arrowhead.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in mammalian cells is associated with the acquisition of the ability to bind DNA. In the response to IFNα/β, Stat1 participates in a complex containing an additional protein, p48, that is essential for DNA binding, whereas in the response to IFNγ p48 is not required for DNA binding. It was therefore important to determine whether Stat1, phosphorylated in a non-mammalian cell where associating proteins are less likely to be present, would bind its cognate sequence. As illustrated in Fig. 3, expression of Stat1 alone resulted in the appearance of no detectable GAS binding activity. However, co-expression of Stat1 with any of the wild type Jaks resulted in the appearance of DNA binding activity. The contribution of Stat1 to this activity is evident from the ability of antisera to Stat1 to supershift the complexes (Fig. 3B).Figure 3:GAS binding activity of phosphorylated Stat1. A, the cell lysates prepared for Fig. 1were used directly for gel shift analysis using an oligonucleotide containing the core GAS element of the interferon regulatory factor 1 promotor. B, alternatively, lysates were mixed with normal rabbit serum (control antibody) or Stat1 specific serum prior to gel shift analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further establish the ability of Jaks to directly phosphorylate Stat1, Jaks were purified by immunoprecipitation and examined for their ability to phosphorylate either a peptide containing Stat1 Tyr701 or purified Stat1. As shown in Fig. 4A, Jak2, but not the kinase inactive mutant Jak2-Glu882, phosphorylated the Stat1 peptide. The specificity is indicated by the lack of phosphorylation of a peptide containing Stat1 Tyr22, a tyrosine that is conserved in all the Stats. Comparable results were obtained with Jak1 and Tyk2 (data not shown). Jak2 was also able to phosphorylate peptides containing the predicted phosphorylation sites of Stat2 and Stat4 (data not shown).Figure 4:Jak2 phosphorylation of a Stat1-Tyr701 peptide. Jak2 immunoprecipitates were prepared for SF9 cells infected with a control virus, Jak2 virus, or Jak2-Glu882 virus. A portion of each immunoprecipitation was used for in vitro kinase reactions with the Tyr701-peptide substrate (A) or the Y22-peptide substrate (B). A portion of the immunoprecipitation was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with Jak2 antisera (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ability of Jaks to phosphorylate purified Stat1 is shown in Fig. 5. For these experiments, Stat1 was purified to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 5A) by sequential ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” The purified Stat1 was added to the immune complex kinase reactions, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and examined by autoradiography (Fig. 5B). As indicated, the reactions were separated into a fraction containing the immune complexes (insoluble) and the supernatant fraction (soluble). Jak1 and Jak2 autophosphorylations were seen in the immune complexes as expected. In addition, a fraction of the phosphorylated Stat1 was co-isolated with the immune complexes. However, phosphorylated Stat1 was also seen in the soluble fraction. The requirements for the Jaks is indicated by the lack of Stat1 phosphorylation by the kinase inactive Jak2-Glu882. Tryptic peptide analysis of in vitro phosphorylated Stat1 demonstrated the phosphorylation of a single tryptic fragment that co-migrated with the Tyr701 tryptic peptide (Fig. 5, C and D). Lastly, in vitro phosphorylation of purified Stat1 activated its latent DNA binding activity (Fig. 6A), and this activation was dependent upon the addition of ATP (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, two distinct GAS binding complexes were seen with in vitro phosphorylated Stat1. The major, faster migrating complex co-migrated with the complex seen in the co-expression studies above. The slower migrating complex was more variably observed. The basis for the second complex is unknown.Figure 5:In vitro phosphorylation of Stat1. Stat1 expressed in SF9 cells was purified by sequential ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Purified Stat1 was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (A). Immune complex kinase preparations were made for Jak1, Jak2, Jak2-Glu882, Tec, EGFR, or control (no kinase) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each kinase preparation was reacted with purified Stat1 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction products were separated by centrifugation into soluble (Stat1) and insoluble (kinase) fractions. Each fraction was further separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography (B). Stat1 phosphorylated by Jak1 (C), Jak2 (D), or EGF-R (E) was then excised from gel slices of the soluble reaction product and used for tryptic phosphopeptide mapping as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6:In vitro activation of Stat1. Immune complex kinase reactions were preformed in the presence or the absence of purified Stat1. Following the kinase reaction, the soluble (Stat1) and insoluble (kinase) components were separated by centrifugation. An aliquot of the soluble portion of each in vitro kinase reaction was assayed for GAS binding activity (A). Aliquots of the insoluble fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with antibodies for phosphotyrosine (B) or with a pool of antisera specific for Tyk2, Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3 (C). Alternatively, Jak2 immune complex kinase reactions were performed with purified Stat1 in the presence or absence of ATP. Aliquots of the soluble fraction of each reaction were incubated with non-reactive rabbit serum (NRS) or anti-Stat1 serum prior to the gel mobility shift assay (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies (7Fu X.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21933-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that EGF stimulation, both in tissue culture cell lines and in vivo, can induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 as well as Stat3. However, it was not determined whether this occurred directly or through the activation of a Jak by the EGFR. As illustrated in Fig. 5B, immune complex purified EGFR readily phosphorylated purified Stat1 and this phosphorylation occurred on a single tryptic peptide corresponding to the peptide containing Tyr701 (Fig. 5E). The specificity is indicated by the inability of Tec to phosphorylate Stat1, although autophosphorylation was readily detectable in these reactions (Fig. 6B). It should also be noted that the immune complex purified Tec and EGFR contained no detectable Jak1 or Jak2 by Western blotting of the preparations (Fig. 6, B and C). As with the Jaks, phosphorylation of Stat1 by EGFR resulted in the activation of its latent DNA binding activity (Fig. 6A).DISCUSSIONThe Jaks are required for cytokine-stimulated signal transduction pathways leading to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the Stats. However, whether the Stats are immediate substrates of the Jaks or substrates of a Jak-activated kinase has not been established. The studies described here address this question and the related question of the specificity of the kinases for Stats. Our results demonstrate that the Jaks are capable of mediating the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 in vivo in insect cells and in in vitro reactions with purified proteins. Similar to Stat1, co-expression of Jak2 with Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5, or Stat6 resulted in their tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown), although these results have not as yet been done with the respective purified proteins. Therefore Stats are potentially immediate substrates of the activated Jaks in vivo.Strikingly, tyrosine phosphorylation, both in insect cells and in vitro, occurs at a single site, Tyr701, although numerous tyrosines are present in Stat1. This specificity is particularly noteworthy because it occurs in the absence of any relevant receptor complex. The specificity for Tyr701 may be determined solely by the immediate flanking sequences and/or other structural determinants of Stat1 that contribute to the tertiary structure and position Tyr701 to be accessible for phosphorylation. The ability of Jaks to phosphorylate a peptide containing Tyr701 demonstrates the ability of the catalytic pocket to bind the site of phosphorylation in the absence of other structural determinants. In this regard it should be noted that considerable similarity exists at comparable sites in the other Stats, as indicated in Table 1. Among these peptides, those for Stat4 and Stat2 peptides are also substrates of Jak2 (data not shown); the remainder have not been examined.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In addition to the Jak-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr701, a second site of phosphorylation was seen in Stat1 produced in insect cells. This phosphorylation was seen without co-expression of the Jaks, suggesting that an endogenous insect cell kinase is involved. The lack of reactivity of Stat1 produced alone in insect cells with antiphosphotyrosine reagents would suggest that this second site of phosphorylation is either a serine or threonine residue. The potential significance of this phosphorylation site is unclear. Because the insect cell-produced Stat1 is constitutively phosphorylated at this site, we cannot rule out a role in DNA binding. In this regard, recent studies have indicated that phosphorylation of Stat1 S727 may be required for maximal transcriptional activation (20Zhang Z. Blenis J. Li H. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar).The above data are consistent with a relatively simple recognition of Stat1 by the Jaks. However, we have also begun to examine the ability of various mutants of Stat proteins to be phosphorylated when co-expressed with Jaks. Strikingly many mutations, deletions, or truncations eliminate the ability of Stats to be recognized and phosphorylated by the Jaks (data not shown). For example, relatively small deletions in the amino-terminal region of Stat4 eliminate its ability to be phosphorylated by Jak2. The basis for these effects are not known and are currently being examined, although they demonstrate that the interaction of Jaks and Stats may be more complex and may be dependent upon Stat tertiary structure.The complexity of Stat activation is further indicated by recent studies that have demonstrated that Stat2 is required for IFNα-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1(21Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell J.E.J. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basis for this dependence is not known; however, it can be hypothesized that Stat2 is required to recruit Stat1 to the receptor complex. Recruitment may rely on the SH2 domain of Stat1 interacting with phosphorylated Stat2. Alternatively, recruitment may rely on heterodimerization of the Stat1 and Stat2 through other domains that affect the ability of the complex to associate with the activated Jaks.When co-expressed in insect cells, Jak1, Jak2, or Tyk2 were equally capable of phosphorylating and activating Stat1. Therefore the specificity with which different cytokines induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific Stat proteins in vivo cannot be ascribed to the Jaks. Rather, the specificity must reside in the ability of individual receptor complexes to recruit specific Stat proteins to the associated Jaks. Recent studies have provided compelling evidence that this recruitment involves the interaction of the SH2 domains of the Stats with sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on the receptor. Specifically, a single tyrosine in the IFNγ receptor α (R1) chain has been implicated in recruiting Stat1(22Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Similarly, tyrosine residues within gp130 or the IL-4 receptor α chain have been shown to be docking sites for Stat3 (23Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) or Stat6(24Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 25Quelle F.W. Shimoda K. Thierfelder W. Fischer C. Kim A. Ruben S.M. Cleveland J.L. Pierce J.H. Keegan A.D. Nelms K. Paul W.E. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3336-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), respectively. Lastly, exchanging SH2 domains has been shown to alter the specificity with which Stat proteins associate with receptor complexes(26Heim M.H. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). It is important to note that in this model and based on our results it is essential that the activated Jaks be restricted to the activated receptor complex to maintain specificity. Indeed, overexpression of Jaks in mammalian cells results in their constitutive, ligand-independent activation and the concommitant constitutive activation of the endogenous Stats(27Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Nature. 1993; 366: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 28Yamamoto K. Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4342-4349Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).The phosphorylation of Stat1, either in vivo in insect cells or in vitro, resulted in the acquisition of GAS DNA binding activity. This result supports the hypothesis that unlike the ISGF3 complex, Stat1 is capable of binding DNA in the absence of any additional factors. Because of this result we have also examined the properties of Stat2 phosphorylated in insect cells by the Jaks (data not shown). Consistent with the current models, no DNA binding activity was detected against either various GAS sequences or the ISRE sequence.The Stat proteins are utilized in signaling pathways other than those activated by receptors of the cytokine receptor superfamily. In particular, EGF has been shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 as well as Stat3(7Fu X. Zhang J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 8Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Science. 1993; 261: 1733-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Ruff-Jamison S. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Chen K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21933-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stat1 is hypothesized to be a necessary component of an EGF induced DNA binding activity that recognizes the SIE (c-sis-inducible element) in the c-fos gene promoter. From these studies, however, it was not clear whether Stat1 phosphorylation was mediated by the EGF receptor or through activation of a Jak. We therefore examined the ability of immuno-purified EGFR to phosphorylate purified Stat1. As demonstrated, EGFR catalyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 at Tyr701. Conversely, Stat1 was not detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated when co-expressed with the Tec protein-tyrosine kinase. Based on these results it will be of some interest to define the spectrum of kinases that are capable of phosphorylating the various Stats. INTRODUCTIONCellular functions are regulated through the interaction of extracellular ligands with their cognate receptors. One group of ligands, variably termed growth factors, cytokines, or colony-stimulating factors, utilize structurally and functionally similar receptors of the cytokine receptor superfamily(1Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). These receptors couple ligand binding to the activation of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation through their association with members of the Janus protein-tyrosine kinase (Jaks) family (reviewed in (2Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) and (3Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar)). The Jak family currently consists of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2, which vary in size from 120-135 kDa. One or more of the Jaks associate with one or more of the cytokine receptor chains at a membrane proximal site of the cytoplasmic domain. The association and activation of Jaks is critical for signaling through these receptors as indicated by the inactivation of receptor function by deletions or point mutations in the receptors that disrupt their ability to associate with the Jaks. A critical role for Jaks in interferon (IFN) 1The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferon(s)EGFRepidermal growth factor receptorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGASinterferon-gamma-activated sequence. signaling has also been established through the identification of cell lines selected for the inability to respond to IFN that lack individual Jaks. In these cells, introduction of the appropriate Jak restores IFN signaling. Lastly, recent studies (4Guschin D. Rogers N. Briscoe J. Witthuhn B. Watling D. Horn F. Pellegrini S. Yasukawa K. Heinrich P. Stark G.R. Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 5Zhuang H. Patel S.V. He T. Sonsteby S.K. Niu Z. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that kinase inactive Jaks can function as dominant negatives in cytokine signaling.The activation of Jaks is required for the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of proteins that are involved in signal transduction. In particular, analysis of receptor mutants has indicated that Jak activation is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHC, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Vav, as well as members of the Stat family of proteins. The Stats (signal transducers and activators of transcription) were initially identified in IFN signaling and have been shown to be essential for many of the responses to IFN (reviewed in (6Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4947) Google Scholar)). Individual cytokines induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of one or more of the seven known Stats (Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5a, Stat5b, and Stat6). In the response to IFNα/β, Jak1 and Tyk2 are activated, and Stat1 and Stat2 are subsequently tyrosine-phosphorylated. Following phosphorylation, Stat1 and Stat2 form a complex with a DNA-binding protein, p48, and the complex translocates to the nucleus, binds DNA, and is required for activation of transcription of IFN responsive genes. The absence of any of the components negates the response. In the response to IFNγ, Jak1 and Jak2 are activated, and Stat1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and forms a DNA binding homodimer that translocates to the nucleus and is required for activation of the transcription of IFNγ responsive genes.Although a strong correlation exists between Jak activation and the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Stats, there has not been direct evidence to support the hypothesis that the Stats are immediate substrates for the Jaks. Indeed, Stat activation has been seen with other receptor systems, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)(7Fu X. Zhang J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 8Ruff-Jamison S. Chen K. Cohen S. Science. 1993; 261: 1733-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Ruff-Jamison S. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Chen K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21933-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the utilization of specific Jaks by individual cytokines and activation of specific Stats have suggested the possibility that individual Jaks may specifically phosphorylate Stats. The studies presented here were designed to address these questions. Using baculovirus expressions systems, we demonstrate that Stat1, either co-expressed with the Jaks or as a purified protein added to immune complex reactions, is a substrate for Jak1, Jak2, or Tyk2. Phosphorylation occurs at the single site previously identified as the in vivo site of tyrosine phosphorylation and as a consequence, Stat1 acquires DNA binding activity. Lastly we demonstrate that Stat1 is similarly a substrate for EGFR but not for the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase Tec."

INTRODUCTIONDuring sporulation the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produces a variety of intracellular insecticidal crystal proteins in the form of crystalline inclusions. These inclusions, when ingested by susceptible insects, are solubilized in the alkaline environment of the insect midgut where the protoxins undergo enzymatic conversion to the active toxin form by resident gut proteases(1Knowles B.H. Adv. Insect Physiol. 1994; 24: 275-308Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar). After activation, CryI toxins have been shown to bind to specific high affinity receptors on the surface of the midgut epithelial cell layer(2Hofmann C. Luthy P. Hutter R. Pliska V. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1989; 186: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Independent studies have shown that B. thuringiensis toxins are able to form ion channels in susceptible cultured insect cells at low concentrations (4Schwartz J.-L. Garneau L. Masson L. Brousseau R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1065: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or in artificial lipid bilayers in the complete absence of receptors at high toxin concentrations(5Slatin S.L.

Biol. 1993; 132: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Perturbation of the intracellular ionic homeostasis created by these ion channels is thought to ultimately result in cell death by lysis(7Knowles B.H. Ellar D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 924: 509-518Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar).Integral to our understanding of the toxin mode of action is the study of toxin interactions with their specific binding proteins. Most of the in vitro studies characterizing these proteins to date have utilized brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) 1The abbreviations used are: BBMVsbrush border membrane vesiclesSPRsurface plasmon resonanceHBSHEPES-buffered salineRUresonance unitsAPNaminopeptidase NCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonatePIPLCphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase CPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. purified from the gut epithelium of susceptible insects (8Wolfersberger M.

Characterization of toxin-binding sites on BBMVs from a variety of larvae has revealed highly complex patterns of toxin binding. The existence of separate distinct classes of toxin-binding proteins as well as single binding sites capable of recognizing multiple toxins has been clearly demonstrated by numerous competition and ligand blotting studies(3van Rie J.

However, the presence of multiple binding proteins on the surface of BBMVs, high levels of nonspecific binding, and inherent toxin integration into the membrane have made the interpretation of brush border binding results rather difficult and have led to some very complex interaction models(3van Rie J. Jansens S. Höfte H. Degheele D. van Mellaert H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 17Estada U. Ferre J. Appl. Env.

In one notable case, a colony of Trichoplusia ni, having developed resistance to CryIA(b) by laboratory selection, failed to show resistance to CryIA(c) although in vitro binding studies demonstrated they share the same binding site(17Estada U. Ferre J. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3840-3846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that binding site predictions based on BBMV studies do not necessarily correlate with in vivo toxicity. Clearly, studies on isolated toxin-binding proteins would be crucial in resolving the relationship between binding sites and binding proteins. Recently, three independent sources have described the purification of a 210-kilodalton (kDa) CryIA(b) (19Vadlamudi R.K. Ji T.H. Bulla Jr., L.A. J. Biol.

SPR is an optical detection technique which allows direct interaction analysis between a ligand immobilized on a modified dextran sensor chip and a specific analyte in a continuous flow system(23Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löf S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. St R. Urbaniczky C. Ö stlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). The reactants are monitored in real time without the use of labels thus permitting the determinations of kinetic rate constants, binding affinities, and binding site characterization(24Karlsson R.

SPR has been used previously to determine the kinetics of CryIA binding to BBMVs from both the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) and the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella)(27Masson L.

In this report, we present a detailed kinetic analysis of CryIA toxin binding interactions with a specific membrane protein purified from the brush border of the lepidopteran larva M. sexta. Detailed evidence is presented showing that two toxins, CryIA(a) and CryIA(b), recognize a single binding site on the purified 115-kDa protein and that CryIA(c) binds to two binding sites. Furthermore, we show that the latter binding is selectively inhibited by the amino sugar N-acetylgalactosamine.MATERIALS AND METHODSToxin PurificationThe three recombinant CryIA protoxins from B. thuringiensis kurstaki (strain NRD-12) were expressed in Escherichia coli as cytoplasmic inclusions and purified as described elsewhere(29Masson L. Préfontaine G. Péloquin L. Lau P.C.K. Brousseau R. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A second CryIA(c) protoxin was isolated from the single gene strain of B. thuringiensis kurstaki (HD-73). All protoxins were activated by solubilization in 40 mM carbonate buffer pH = 10.5 and treated with trypsin (0.1% (w/v) final concentration) for 3 h at ambient temperature. The 65-kDa trypsin-resistant proteins were purified by ion-exchange liquid chromatography using either Mono Q or Q-Sepharose anion exchangers (Pharmacia LKB AB) buffered with 40 mM carbonate buffer pH = 10.5. Bound toxins were eluted using a 50-500 mM NaCl gradient, dialyzed against four changes of distilled water, and the precipitated protein recovered and stored as a concentrated stock in water. Protein levels were quantitated by the dye-binding method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213347) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To minimize the formation of multimers, a small aliquot of precipitated toxin was resuspended in HBS (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA) before each experiment and kept on ice(31Feng Q. Becktel W.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8521-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). CryIA(c) toxin for radiolabeling was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography and directly iodinated by the chloramine-T method (32Hunter W. Greenwood F. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5839) Google Scholar) as described in Garczynski et al.(14Garczynski S.F. Crim J.W. Adang M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 2816-2820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activity of the labeled toxin was about 50 mCi/mg input toxin.Preparation of Brush Border Membrane VesiclesM. sexta eggs were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Services, Biosciences Research Laboratory (Fargo, ND) and larvae reared on artificial diet (Southland Products, Inc., Lake Village, AR). BBMVs were made from second day 5th instar larvae using the MgCl2 precipitation method of Wolfersberger et al.(8Wolfersberger M. Luthy P. Mauer A. Parenti P. Sacchi V. Giordana B. Hanozet G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86: 301-308Crossref Scopus (544) Google Scholar), except that 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was included in the final suspension buffer. BBMVs were stored at −80°C until needed.Purification of M. sexta 115-kDa ProteinBBMVs (10 mg of protein) were solubilized at 4°C for 30 min in 2 ml of Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% CHAPS (v/v). Undissolved material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. CHAPS-solubilized BBMVs were chromatographed in Buffer A plus 0.2% CHAPS on a Sephacryl 300 column (Pharmacia). Fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar) and ligand blotting. Fractions containing the 115-kDa toxin-binding protein were dialyzed against Buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% CHAPS) at 4°C overnight, loaded onto a Mono Q column pre-equilibrated with Buffer B, then the bound proteins eluted with 0-600 mM NaCl in Buffer B.Ligand Blot AnalysesBBMVs or purified proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked with 5% (w/v) dry milk in TBS-T (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h, followed by three washes with TBS-T. Filters were bathed with 125I-CryIA(c) (108 counts/min/10 ml TBS-T) for 3 h, washed three times in TBS-T, blotted dry, and exposed to x-ray film at −80°C.Instrumentation and ReagentsThe surface plasmon resonance detector (BIAcore™) system and CM5 sensor chips were obtained from Pharmacia Biosensor. All chemical immobilizations of the M. sexta 115-kDa receptor were done using the standard BIAcore amine coupling protocol provided with the Pharmacia coupling kit. Bovine serum albumin (fraction 5, radioimmunoassay grade) was purchased from Sigma. The buffers used with the BIAcore machine contained the following: HBS-P20 (HBS containing 0.05% BIAcore Surfactant P20), regeneration buffer (50 mM CAPS, pH 11.0, and 150 mM NaCl), carboxymethylated dextran activation solutions (A = 0.1 MN-hydroxysuccinimide, B = 0.1 MN-ethyl-N‘-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), coupling buffer (20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.5), and deactivation solution (1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.5). Approximately 700-1500 RUs of the 115-kDa binding protein (dissolved as a 0.1 mg/ml stock solution in 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 5) was amine-coupled to the dextran. A reagent flow rate of 5 μl/min was used during all experiments except for dissociation rates which used 15 μl/min.Binding AnalysesAll sensorgram data transformations and analyses were performed with BIAevaluation software version 2.1. using non-linear least-squares curve fitting. This method of kinetic binding analysis permits the determination of both the dissociation rate constant (kd) and the association rate constant (ka) for each binding experiment(26O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 34O'Shannessy D.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For all kinetic toxin binding experiments, kd was determined first by plotting the log of the drop in response, ln(R0/R), against the time interval (t), where R0 is the response at an arbitrarily chosen starting time soon after toxin flow is replaced by buffer, and Rand t are data points chosen every 0.5 s along the dissociation curve. The apparent kd value was used to constrain values when determining the ka constant. The maximum binding levels for each toxin was determined on surfaces containing approximately 700-1500 RUs (representing a surface of approximately 6.1-13.1 fmol/mm2) of immobilized 115-kDa receptor. Since the molecular mass of a protein is proportional to the SPR response (35Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1002) Google Scholar), an immobilized surface, representing 1000 RU of the 115-kDa binding protein, could theoretically bind 565 RUs of a 65-kDa toxin analyte (A) in a simple one binding site model (A+B ⇔ AB) on ligand (B). To prevent any influence by toxin rebinding, the immobilized ligand was saturated with analyte and the start point arbitrarily chosen 5 s after the start of buffer flow where the ln(R0/R) against (t) curve initially becomes linear.To determine ka, eight different toxin concentrations ranging from 50 to 1500 nM were injected over immobilized APN. As with the kd determination, all data were fitted to either a one-site (A+B ⇔ AB) or a two-site model (A+B1+B2 ⇔ AB1+AB2). Whenever possible, fitted lines from either model were compared to each other using an F-test comparison. All models were verified by residual plots which calculate the difference between the observed and the fitted curves for each data point. To determine the goodness of fit of the data to the model, both association and dissociation rate constants were chosen from sensorgrams producing a chi2 value less than one. All models used in our kinetic evaluations were further evaluated by lag plots to determine the relationship of neighboring data points thus providing additional support for binding model selection (data not shown).Competition StudiesTwo types of competition studies were performed. For carbohydrate inhibition experiments, toxins were diluted in HBS-P20 buffer containing varying concentrations of either N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), D-glucose (BDH, Inc., Toronto, Ontario), or D-mannose (Sigma) to a final concentration of 150 nM and injected over an immobilized receptor surface (approximately 1000 RUs). The highest response obtained for each sugar concentration injected over the receptor surface in the absence of toxin was subtracted from the highest RU value obtained in the presence of toxin and the results expressed as percent inhibition. For binding site competition experiments, saturating levels of toxin pairs were injected individually or co-injected over a surface of immobilized receptor.RESULTSPurification of 115-kDa CryIA(c)-binding APNThe 120-kDa APN that binds CryIA(c) toxin is cleaved to a 115 kDa form by treatment with PIPLC(36Garczynski S.F. Adang M.J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 409-415Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The same 120-115 kDa conversion occurs in solubilized preparations of M. sexta BBMVs due to an endogenous PIPLC. 2Lu, Y. J., and Adang, M.(1995) Biochem. Mol. Biol., in press. The 115-kDa APN form has the same N terminus, lacks the lipid moiety on the glycosylphosphatidyl inositol membrane anchor, and still binds CryIA(c) toxin. M. sexta BBMVs were solubilized in 1% CHAPS then fractionated by S-300 gel filtration in the presence of 0.2% CHAPS. Protein blots were probed with 125I-CryIA(c) to identify fractions containing toxin-binding 115-kDa APN. Toxin-binding 115-kDa protein was further purified by a Mono Q chromatography step. Fig. 1shows a stained gel and ligand blot of CHAPS-solubilized BBMVs and purified 115-kDa protein.Stoichiometry and Kinetic AnalysesIncreasing concentrations of the different CryI toxin subclasses were injected over a low density surface of immobilized 115-kDa receptor to determine levels required for ligand saturation. As summarized in Fig. 2, CryIA(c) bound to almost a 2-fold higher level than either CryIA(a) or CryIA(b). Considering that the molecular masses of all three activated toxins are essentially the same (~65 kDa) and that the SPR response corresponds linearly to the surface protein concentration (35Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Coll. Int. Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) these results indicate that the immobilized 115-kDa protein possesses a single binding site for either CryIA(a) or CryIA(b) but that CryIA(c) binds to two sites on the same molecule. Injection of a similar concentration of CryIC resulted in little or no specific binding demonstrating the specificity of the immobilized ligand for the three CryIA toxins.Figure 2:Stoichiometric analysis of CryIA binding. Saturating levels of CryIC, CryIA(a), or CryIA(b) (1500 nM) and of CryIA(c) (1000 nM) were injected at 5 μl/min over a surface of immobilized 115-kDa CryIA(c)-binding protein representing approximately 1000 RU. At the end of the injection, toxin flow was replaced by buffer alone and the sensorgram allowed to continue for an additional 100 s to demonstrate the rate of complex dissociation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the number of toxin-binding sites and determine the kinetic rate constants, different toxin concentrations were injected over a surface of immobilized 115-kDa ligand. The binding data from each curve were fitted by non-linear least-squares fitting to either a one- or two-site model. The model fitting further suggested that CryIA(a) and CryIA(b) bound to a single site on the immobilized ligand whereas CryIA(c) best fit a two-site model (F-test comparison between the two models gave a probability = 1). The possibility that the second observed CryIA(c) dissociation rate was caused by the rebinding of toxin to immobilized aminopeptidase was eliminated since a plot of the log of the drop in response against time interval produced a linear rather than a curved response, a normal indicator of rebinding. 3L. Masson, unpublished observations. Residual plots (i.e. a plot of the difference between the observed and the calculated response for each data point) of the dissociation segment of the response curves were created to verify the appropriateness of the binding model chosen. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the data point distribution is random around the x axis and the signal noise is no greater than background (±2 RU) thus indicating that the quality of fit was good for CryIA(a) and CryIA(b) to a single binding site model. The χ2 values, testing for the goodness-of-fit, for all the sensorgrams from the different toxin concentrations were <1.0. Fig. 4shows a fitting of the CryIA(c) data to a one-site (A) and a two-site (B) model. The distribution of points for fitting of the data to a one-site model is clearly not random and is greater than background noise suggesting a poor fit. All χ2 values for the one-site model were found to be >1.0. If the data are fitted to a model which accounts for two separate toxin-binding sites on the ligand, the point distribution becomes random indicating a good fit. Furthermore, all χ2 values obtained from the different sensorgrams fall below 1.0 providing additional support for the two-site hypothesis. Residual plots performed on data from the association area of the sensorgram were similar to those shown above for the dissociation segments (data not shown).Figure 3:Dissociation rate residual plots for CryIA(a) and CryIA(b). Residual plots, representing the randomness of data point distribution around a fitted curve, are shown for a typical binding data set taken 40 s after the start of complex dissociation for CryIA(a) (A) or CryIA(b) (B) when applied to a one-site model (A+B ⇔ AB). In the Response plot, the actual dissociation data points are represented by a solid line and the fitted curve by a dashed line.

Each toxin studied displayed a moderately fast association rate showing at most a 5-fold variation. The most interesting differences were found in the various dissociation rates. In general, all the E. coli produced NRD-12 toxins showed similar kd values; however, the second CryIA(c)-binding site demonstrated a much faster rate (≥ an order of magnitude) of toxin-receptor complex dissociation than that calculated for the other CryIA toxins. Furthermore, the B. thuringiensis produced CryIA(c) toxin, although showing ka rates indistinguishable from the E. coli produced CryIA(c), demonstrated a 2-fold faster dissociation rate for both sites than the E. coli produced toxin. Despite the observed variations in kinetic rates, the three CryIA toxins from NRD-12 essentially share the same affinity for the immobilized aminopeptidase with CryIA(c) also binding to a second site at a lower affinity.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Competition AnalysesIn order to verify whether the multiple binding sites were unique or shared among the three CryIA toxins, saturating levels of toxins were paired together and co-injected over a surface of immobilized ligand. If the toxins bind to separate sites, an additive effect should be observed when comparing the maximal binding response (Rmax) to single toxin injections. As shown in Fig. 5A, pairing of the CryIA(a) and CryIA(b) toxins produced a maximal binding level (Rmax) similar to either of the individual injections. This result agrees with the finding of van Rie et al.(3van Rie J. Jansens S. Höfte H. Degheele D. van Mellaert H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) using BBMVs from M. sexta that these two toxins share the same site. When the CryIA(b) toxin is paired with the CryIA(c) toxin, an additive effect is again absent. The maximal binding level obtained with the co-injected toxins was similar to CryIA(c) alone suggesting that one of the two CryIA(c)-binding sites is shared with CryIA(b) and by extension, CryIA(a). Experiments using consecutive rather than simultaneous toxin injections were attempted, but the ability of toxins to bind to each other at high concentrations (28Masson L. Mazza A. Brousseau R.

We have performed site-directed mutagenesis on the carboxyl-terminal tail of the Flt-1 receptor in order to identify the site(s) that is responsible for the p85 interactions. A single tyrosine to phenylalanine change at position 1213 inhibits the binding of both p85 SH2 domains.

https://openalex.org/W2044679375,"In pancreatic islets, formation of β-secretory granule cores involves early proinsulin homohexamerization and subsequent insulin condensation. We examined proinsulin conformational maturation by monitoring accessibility of protein disulfide bonds. Proinsulin disulfides are intact immediately upon synthesis, but are ≥90% sensitive to in vivo reduction with 2 mM dithiothreitol; wash out of dithiothreitol leads to reoxidation, proinsulin transport, and conversion to insulin. With t ∼10 min, newly synthesized proinsulin becomes resistant to disulfide reduction, correlating with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export. However, inhibition of ER export with brefeldin A blocks acquisition of resistance to reduction, and once proinsulin arrives in the Golgi, it resists reduction despite brefeldin treatment. Moreover, in vivo, resistance of proinsulin disulfides is overcome after increasing [dithiothreitol] > 10-fold, or in vitro, in islets lysed in a zinc-free, but not a zinc-containing, medium. Employing 30 mM dithiothreitol in vivo, a further decrease in disulfide accessibility is observed following proinsulin conversion to insulin. Incubation of islets with chloroquine or zinc enhances and diminishes accessibility of insulin disulfides, respectively. We hypothesize that two major conformational changes culminating in granule core formation, proinsulin hexamerization and insulin condensation, are sensitive to zinc and occur upon ER exit and arrival in immature secretory granules, respectively. In pancreatic islets, formation of β-secretory granule cores involves early proinsulin homohexamerization and subsequent insulin condensation. We examined proinsulin conformational maturation by monitoring accessibility of protein disulfide bonds. Proinsulin disulfides are intact immediately upon synthesis, but are ≥90% sensitive to in vivo reduction with 2 mM dithiothreitol; wash out of dithiothreitol leads to reoxidation, proinsulin transport, and conversion to insulin.

We hypothesize that two major conformational changes culminating in granule core formation, proinsulin hexamerization and insulin condensation, are sensitive to zinc and occur upon ER exit and arrival in immature secretory granules, respectively. The distinguishing feature of regulated secretory cells is the packaging of a distinct subset of proteins into insoluble dense cores within storage granules (Palade, 1975; Kelly, 1985). Although most storage granule contents are rapidly solubilized upon exocytosis, intracellular accumulation of secretory proteins at supersaturating conditions appears to represent a conserved mechanism by which glandular tissues ready themselves for an acute response to demand for protein secretion. In the β-cells of pancreatic islets, insulin is normally stored within a polymerized condensate in the cores of granules, which are stimulated to undergo exocytotic discharge in response to glucose. In the secretory pathway of these cells, insulin is initially made as the single chain precursor, proinsulin. Endoproteolysis converts the soluble prohormone into insulin that becomes insoluble (Steiner, 1973; Michael et al., 1987; Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994), a process that begins after the former enters immature secretory granules (Orci et al., 1987; Huang and Arvan, 1994). While remaining highly soluble in the early secretory pathway, proinsulin normally progresses from monomers to homohexamers (Frank and Veros, 1968, 1970; Grant et al., 1972; Steiner, 1973; Baker et al., 1988). It has been hypothesized that proinsulin assembly to homohexamers proceeds within the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumDTTdithiothreitolDMEDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumIAAiodoacetamidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineBFAbrefeldin ABSAbovine serum albuminMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. (Emdin et al., 1980) and indeed for many secretory proteins, such oligomerization is a prerequisite for ER export (for review, see Hurtley and Helenius (1989)). Recently, several remarkable studies have shown that conformational maturation of newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway can be monitored in vivo, by changes in the accessibility of protein disulfide bonds (Alberini et al., 1990; Braakman et al., 1992; Kaji and Lodish, 1993; Lodish and Kong, 1993). Moreover, it has been established that disulfide bonds in exportable proteins, including regulated secretory proteins, may be reduced in vivo not only within the ER but also in Golgi and post-Golgi compartments (Chanat et al., 1993; Tatu et al., 1993; Valetti and Sitia, 1994). If disulfide accessibility represents a useful means to follow proinsulin structural maturation during its intracellular transport, then it should be possible to use this approach to examine the stages of conformational maturation of this regulated secretory protein, which lead ultimately to granule core condensation. endoplasmic reticulum dithiothreitol Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium iodoacetamide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine brefeldin A bovine serum albumin 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. With this in mind, we have examined pancreatic β-cells of live islets, to explore dithiothreitol (DTT)-mediated disulfide bond reduction of proinsulin and insulin while in transit through the secretory pathway. We find that, in live β-cells, the accessibility of proinsulin disulfides to reducing agents is lost in two discrete stages. Surprisingly, the first stage, which is likely to represent proinsulin hexamerization, does not occur within the ER but occurs just after ER export. The second stage, which is likely to represent granule core formation, occurs shortly after proteolytic conversion to insulin. Interestingly, both of these stages appear to be facilitated by zinc ions. Collagenase was from Worthington (Freehold, NJ); Hypaque, human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, chloroquine, zinc sulfate, iodoacetamide, and DTT were from Sigma; calf serum and antibiotic-antimycotic solution were from Life Technologies, Inc.; [35S]methionine/cysteine (Express) were from DuPont NEN; and brefeldin A was from Epicentre Technologies Corp. (Madison, WI). Islets from 30-g CD-1 mice were isolated by pancreatic ductal perfusion with collagenase, flotation on a hypaque gradient, picking of individual islets, and recovery overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME) containing 10% calf serum plus 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Islets were washed twice with Met-free, Cys-free DME, prior to pulse labeling for times ranging up to 5 min at 37°C in the same medium containing ∼300 μCi of [35S]methionine and cysteine. At the conclusion of the pulse labeling, the islets were washed and chased in complete DME. All labeling and chase media also contained 0.5 mg/ml human serum albumin and 0.005% soybean trypsin inhibitor. Chase incubations for batches of islets were performed as described (Huang and Arvan, 1994). When employed, brefeldin A was used at 10 μg/ml. Islets were lysed by sonication in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, containing Triton X-100 ranging from 0.1 to 1.0% in different experiments. An anti-protease mixture of aprotinin (1 milliunit/ml), leupeptin (0.1 mM), pepstatin (10 mM), EDTA (5 mM), and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 mM) was added to the islet lysates. The alkylating agent, iodoacetamide (IAA) was also added (described below). Prior to lysis, islets were either mock-treated or treated with DTT in complete DME for 10 min at 37°C. At the conclusion of the incubation with reducing agent, the islets were rapidly washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mM IAA and lysed (as described above) in a buffer including 50 mM IAA (except in Fig. 7, where the IAA dose was 150 mM). The islet lysate was spun briefly in a Microfuge to remove debris. The supernatant was further incubated in the presence of the alkylating agent (overnight at 4°C) before electrophoretic analysis. In Fig. 6, lysed islets were either mock-treated or treated with DTT in lysis buffer, before alkylation overnight at 4°C in the presence of 100 mM IAA, and in Fig. 8, alkylation employed 150 mM IAA.Figure 6:In vitro, proinsulin re-acquires sensitivity to disulfide reduction, but its structure is stabilized in the presence of zinc. A, isolated islets were pulse labeled for 5 min with 35S-labeled amino acids and then chased for the times indicated. At each chase time the islets were lysed at neutral pH as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, a separate preparation of islets were pulse labeled for 5 min and chased for 20 min before lysis in the presence or absence of 0.5 mM ZnSO4, at neutral pH as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each lysate was then treated with low dose DTT either at the doses shown (A) or at 2 mM (B) for 10 min at 37°C. After treatment with DTT, the lysates were incubated in ice-cold buffer containing 100 mM IAA overnight at 4°C. All samples were then analyzed by Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE without prior immunoprecipitation.

A, isolated mouse pancreatic islets were continuously labeled for 10 min with 35S-labeled amino acids and then lysed in unbuffered 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, and 8 M urea, with the intention to fully denature newly synthesized proinsulin. The lysate was then divided into five aliquots containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 40 mM Tris-Mes (20 mM Tris, 20 mM Mes) at the pH values shown and treated with 30 mM DTT for 10 min at 37°C. B, a constitutive secretory protein, BSA, was dissolved in 150 mM NaCl plus 0.1% Triton X-100 (lanes marked “TX”). The samples were then divided into five aliquots (lanes 3-7) and reduced as in A. In parallel, two additional BSA samples were denatured by exposure to 2% SDS and then divided into equal portions. One was treated with 5 mM DTT (lane 1) and a second was nonreduced (lane 2). Finally, all samples in A and B were alkylated with 150 mM IAA overnight at 4°C. A, the samples were analyzed by Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The positions of fully reduced (Red.) and fully oxidized (Ox.) proinsulin standards (St'd) are shown with arrows on the left.

The position of fully oxidized albumin standard is shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Islet lysates were analyzed by 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE plus urea using a Tricine buffer system (Schagger and von Jagow, 1987). In this system, mouse proinsulins I and II were not resolved from one another, nor were insulins I and II. Reduced and oxidized mouse proinsulin were run as standards on all gels. Insulin gels were fixed initially in 20% trichloroacetic acid without alcohol, then in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid plus 50% methanol, then incubated briefly with water, and finally incubated with 1 M sodium salicylate for 20 min. Dried gels were exposed to XAR film at −70°C. Proinsulin has three highly conserved disulfide bonds; all are preserved within insulin. Based on the x-ray structure of the 2-Zn/insulin crystal, solvent accessibility is highest for the interchain B7-A7 bond, lower for the interchain B19-A20 disulfide, and most buried in the case of the intrachain A6-A11 bond (Blundell et al., 1971; Baker et al., 1988). In order to resolve different forms of proinsulin exhibiting either a full or partial complement of disulfide bonds, pulse-labeled mouse pancreatic islets were lysed and then treated with low doses of DTT in SDS-sample buffer. The partially reduced lysates were then alkylated with iodoacetamide and analyzed by Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE and fluorography. A progressively decreasing mobility was observed for proinsulin as a function of the DTT dose used for in vitro exposure. Specifically, four discrete regions of proinsulin were detected (Fig. 1). It is apparent from these data that the four observed bands signify increasing reduction of proinsulin, corresponding to the hydrolysis of none, one, two, or all three proinsulin disulfide bonds. In order to estimate the rate at which native proinsulin disulfide bonds are formed in vivo, isolated mouse islets were pulse-labeled for 1 min and rapidly lysed either without chase or after a brief chase period. At each chase time, the islets were lysed in the presence of iodoacetamide and then analyzed under nonreducing conditions by Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 2, most labeled proinsulin was already fully oxidized at the zero chase time. Eliminating the possibility that proinsulin disulfides might form artifactually at the time of cell lysis, the same results were obtained when the islets were preincubated with 20 mMN-ethylmaleimide in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min before the lysis step (data not shown). Since the labeling itself was 1 min in duration, it is clear that formation of the three native disulfide bonds in proinsulin is complete within a minute and is likely to occur co-translationally. Nascent secretory proteins within the ER undergo significant monomer folding (Kim and Arvan, 1993) which may allow presentation of a suitable surface for recognition of oligomerization partners (Hurtley and Helenius, 1989). Because these processes are expected to result in decreased accessibility of protein disulfide bonds, we examined the susceptibility of disulfides in newly synthesized proinsulin to reduction by low doses of DTT. First, isolated islets were pulse-labeled for 5 min and chased for times ranging from 0 to 20 min, before exposure of the live cells to reducing agent. At the zero chase time, proinsulin disulfides were ≥90% reduced upon subsequent exposure to low dose (2 mM) DTT (Fig. 3, lane 1). If, after DTT exposure, the live islets were washed free of DTT and the 37°C chase continued in fresh medium, reduced proinsulin was quantitatively reoxidized (Fig. 4). Reoxidation was complete within 5 min after DTT washout and did not impair the ability of previously reduced protein to be transported through the secretory pathway and converted to insulin (data not shown). Thus, like for other exportable proteins (Braakman et al., 1992), proinsulin was reduced in the ER, and this reduction was fully reversible.Figure 4:Reduction of proinsulin disulfides in the ER is reversible. Isolated islets were pulse-labeled for 5 min (lane 1) and immediately exposed to 5 mM DTT for 10 min with the intention of fully reducing proinsulin in vivo (lane 2). The islets were then washed and chased in normal medium for the recovery times indicated (lanes 3 and 4) before lysis and overnight alkylation as in Fig. 3. The lysates were analyzed by Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE without prior immunoprecipitation. The positions of fully reduced (Red.) and fully oxidized (Ox.) proinsulin standards (St'd) are shown with arrows on the left side. Upon further chase, re-oxidized proinsulin was proteolytically converted to insulin (not shown), indicating normal intracellular transport to secretory granules.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the reported t of 10-20 min for proinsulin exit from the ER (Steiner et al., 1986) and a similar rate through the Golgi stacks (Howell et al., 1969), it is expected that by 20 min of chase, at least half of labeled proinsulin should have exited the ER and been in transit through Golgi cisternae. Over the course of a 20-min chase, labeled proinsulin disulfides changed progressively from being largely reduced upon low dose DTT exposure (Fig. 3, lane 1) to predominantly resistant to reduction (Fig. 3, lane 4). At 5 min of chase, roughly 70% of labeled proinsulin remained sensitive to low dose DTT, whereas at 10 min this value approached 50%; these data suggest a t for acquisition of DTT resistance ≈ 10 min. 2Calculations from the chase times selected in this paper are based on a model of intercompartmental vesicular transport that assumes first-order kinetics (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987). Since some of our experiments employed no pharmacological block of transport, no “perfect” chase times could be selected in these experiments (i.e. times in which a radioactive wave of proinsulin labeled one compartment to the exclusion of all others (Farquhar et al., 1978; Salpeter and Farquhar, 1981)). For the purposes of this study, 20 min of chase was selected as a time when a majority of proinsulin is thought to be in Golgi cisternae, although a minority may have reached the trans-Golgi network and another minor fraction may have lingered in the ER; whereas 30 min of chase was selected as a time when a majority of proinsulin is thought to have reached the trans-Golgi network, a minority may have reached immature granules and another minor fraction may have lingered in prior compartments (Howell et al., 1969; Orci, 1982). Thus, based on the foregoing information, conformational maturation of proinsulin in vivo appeared to correlate with its intracellular transport. Specifically, these data appeared consistent with a published hypothesis (Emdin et al., 1980) that proinsulin might hexamerize before its exit from the ER. However, these kinetic data do not exclude the possibility of initial oligomerization in the Golgi (Jascur et al., 1991; Musil and Goodenough, 1993) or the possibility of initial oligomerization in the ER with larger assembly units forming subsequently (Wagner and Marder, 1984; Colley and Baenziger, 1987). To more precisely define the relationship between the initial acquisition of DTT resistance and proinsulin export from the ER, pulse-chase experiments were performed in the presence of brefeldin A (BFA, 10 μg/ml). Previous studies have indicated that in β-cells of mouse pancreatic islets (Huang and Arvan, 1994), like in many other cells (Klausner et al., 1992), the use of BFA blocks anterograde traffic of proteins out of the ER. As expected for pulse-labeled islets exposed to DTT without prior chase, the presence of BFA during the labeling period did not diminish the susceptibility of ≥90% of newly synthesized proinsulin to reduction with low dose DTT (Fig. 5A, lane 1). However, even after 20 min of chase in the continuous presence of BFA, proinsulin in live islets failed to acquire resistance to reduction with low dose DTT (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Because BFA itself is not known to interfere with protein folding or assembly within the ER (Doms et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1991; Russ et al., 1991; Collins and Mottet, 1992), the conformational maturation revealed by DTT resistance must be a consequence of intracellular transport of proinsulin, whereupon it encounters some feature of the Golgi lumenal environment. Thus, the t of ∼10 min (Fig. 3) appears to reflect the kinetics of a process that occurs immediately after rather than before proinsulin exit from the ER. When pulse-labeled islets (Fig. 5B, lane 1) were chased 20 min so that most proinsulin had reached the Golgi (Fig. 5B, lane 2), further chase in the presence of BFA failed to disassemble or unfold proinsulin back to its previous, DTT-susceptible state (Fig. 5B, lane 3). These data confirm that, separate from general effects on membrane traffic, BFA has no specific effect on proinsulin conformation. However, independent of BFA, when pulse-labeled proinsulin was chased for either 15 or 30 min before islet lysis in a zinc-free medium, most labeled proinsulin was no longer resistant to reduction in the presence of low dose DTT (i.e.in vitro reduction with either 0.5 or 1.5 mM DTT, Fig. 6A). Importantly, significant resistance to reduction by 2 mM DTT was maintained simply by adding 0.5 mM zinc to the islet lysis medium (Fig. 6B). These data (Fig. 3-6) demonstrate that a new state in conformational maturation can be detected in live cells upon proinsulin transport from the ER to the Golgi; this new state is unaffected by subsequent addition of BFA, but is largely reversed in vitro upon dilution of proinsulin into a zinc-free, but not a zinc-containing, buffer. Since proinsulin eventually proceeds along the intracellular transport pathway to immature secretory granules where proteolytic conversion to insulin occurs (Huang and Arvan, 1994), we performed new dose-response curves of proinsulin at later chase times in order to develop an assay of further changes in the accessibility of proinsulin disulfide bonds in live pancreatic β-cells. At 20 min of chase when initial resistance of proinsulin disulfides to reduction with low dose DTT had achieved a maximum (Fig. 3), progressive reduction could still be detected as the DTT dose was incrementally raised by more than an order of magnitude (Fig. 7). Although at delayed chase times, some variability was observed in the degree of sensitivity of proinsulin and processed insulin to in vivo reduction (i.e. in occasional experiments, essentially complete proinsulin reduction and even significant insulin reduction was observed with high dose DTT (see below)), 3Despite attempts to control digestion conditions during islet isolation, the size distribution of islets from different preparations varied. Unlike studies of proinsulin in the ER (which was always reduced with low dose DTT), in experiments attempting to achieve reduction that required high dose DTT, it appeared that preparation-dependent variability in disulfide cleavage related to differences in DTT penetration. This variability was thought to be an acceptable consequence of islet experiments, since such results were thought to have greater physiological significance than comparable experiments performed in cell lines (where penetration of DTT is more uniform). Despite increased reduction observed in experiments where the islets were smaller (e.g. Fig. 10), comparative data between samples within the same preparation were reproducible and thus did not affect our conclusions. we elected to employ 30 mM DTT as our standard means by which to monitor further conformational maturation of proinsulin in the distal secretory pathway. During proinsulin trafficking from the Golgi stacks to mature storage granules, there is progressive acidification of the lumen of the secretory pathway (Orci et al., 1986). Since the ability of DTT to reduce disulfide bonds is affected by the prevailing pH (Means and Feeney, 1971), we were concerned that detection of delayed changes in proinsulin disulfide sensitivity might be obscured by direct effects of pH on the potency of DTT. To control for this, we initially examined the effect of pH on the ability of DTT to reduce proinsulin that was largely denatured by exposure to 8 M urea. Denaturation was intended to minimize potential effects of pH on protein conformation per se (Bewley and Li, 1969), so that these data could be used largely as a measure of DTT efficacy in disulfide reduction. As shown in Fig. 8A using a 10-min exposure at 37°C to high dose DTT, proinsulin was essentially fully reduced over the entire pH range from 6.8 to 5.2, although a slight decrease was noted at pH 5.2. 4We could not be sure that we achieved complete proinsulin denaturation, even in the presence of 8 M urea. With this in mind, additional thermal denaturation (boiling the sample) led to quantitatively identical and complete reduction of proinsulin at all pH values, including pH 5.2. A similar point was demonstrated by in vitro reduction of bovine serum albumin (BSA), a constitutive secretory protein that is highly disulfide-bonded and highly soluble (Gerdes et al., 1989; Freedman and Scheele, 1993). When treated with SDS for denaturation, essentially full reduction of protein disulfides was accomplished (Fig. 8B, lane 1). By contrast, when BSA was dissolved in 150 mM NaCl containing only 0.1% Triton X-100 (comparable with the islet lysis buffer), disulfide reduction was limited, causing only minor SDS-PAGE mobility shifts for a large fraction of the protein, although a very small fraction was fully reduced at the highest pH (Fig. 8B, lane 7). Evidently, in contrast with the effects of protein conformation per se (compare lanes 1 and 7), changes of pH in the range from 6.8 to 5.2 (Fig. 8B, lanes 3-7) have at most a modest effect on DTT-mediated disulfide reduction. Thus, the ability of high dose (30 mM) DTT to cause full disulfide reduction is not limiting (Fig. 8A),4 except to the extent that protein structure alters disulfide reactivity/accessibility (Fig. 8B). We therefore proceeded to examine the susceptibility of disulfides to reduction in pulse-labeled islets in which labeled proinsulin had been chased to the trans-Golgi network or later compartments. Arrival of labeled proinsulin at immature secretory granules could be monitored by ongoing proteolytic conversion to insulin (Huang and Arvan, 1994). In these experiments, although proinsulin in live islets was largely sensitive to reduction with high dose DTT prior to the appearance of labeled insulin, it was clear that a major step-up in resistance to reduction occurred following proteolytic processing to insulin (Fig. 9A). Moreover, except for a possible small lag time after initial insulin formation, resistance of newly made insulin to high dose DTT relatively rapidly approached that found in mature granules from the same preparation (as measured after overnight chase, see Fig. 9B). These data suggest strongly that in addition to initial conformational changes that take place upon proinsulin transport from ER → Golgi, new DTT resistance occurs within immature granules (at least in part reflecting quaternary structural maturation that occurs after C-peptide is released from the proinsulin backbone (Huang and Arvan, 1994)), and this state is preserved during the maturation of storage granules. Previous reports have indicated that in pancreatic β-cells, most of the formation of insoluble aggregates of regulated secretory protein begins within immature granules (Huang and Arvan, 1994) and that 100 μM chloroquine or zinc added to the islet chase medium selectively inhibits or promotes granule core condensation, respectively (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994). Since these conclusions are based upon in vitro observations, we sought to examine the effect of these perturbations on β-granule core formation as monitored by proinsulin and insulin disulfide accessibility in vivo. In control islets at 2-h chase, roughly 70% of proinsulin had been converted to insulin (Fig. 10, lane 5). Although the remaining proinsulin in the control islets was nearly fully reduced by in vivo exposure to high dose DTT (lane 6), insulin contained within the immature granules of these islets was fairly evenly divided into three portions in which: 1) no disulfide reduction was evident, 2) at least one disulfide bond had been broken (the insulin band shifted up in the gel), or 3) both interchain disulfide bonds were broken (insulin hydrolyzed into separate A and B chains ran off our Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE system and therefore could only be detected as protein under-recovery). The addition of chloroquine from 70 to 120 min of chase did not inhibit the conversion of proinsulin to insulin (Fig. 10, compare lanes 1 and 5), nor the fraction of proinsulin that was reduced by exposure to DTT (lanes 2 and 6). However, upon chloroquine exposure, none of the insulin contained within immature granules was protected from disulfide reduction: a minority of the insulin was partially reduced (band shift up), whereas most had lost both interchain disulfide bonds (compare lanes 1 and 2). Finally, islet exposure to zinc appeared to modestly slow the rate of proinsulin conversion within immature granules (Fig. 10, lane 3). Nevertheless, this increased fraction of proinsulin remained highly sensitive to high dose DTT, whereas the insulin contained within immature granules showed markedly increased resistance to reduction (lane 4). These data indicate that chloroquine treatment did not block proinsulin conversion to insulin but inhibited granule core formation, whereas zinc treatment modestly slowed proinsulin conversion and yet enhanced granule core formation. This investigation has concentrated on new methods to explore the quaternary structural maturation of proinsulin in the secretory pathway of mouse pancreatic β-cells. In selecting in vivo reduction as our primary tool, we were aware that, since it is based on the spatial positioning of protein disulfide bonds, this method may not work for all proteins and by itself cannot define the size of assembled protein complexes. However, we are extremely fortunate that the tertiary and quaternary structures of proinsulin and insulin, the location of their three highly conserved disulfide bonds, and their reduction have all been well characterized (Bewley and Li, 1969; Blundell et al., 1972). Furthermore, hexamerization of this protein within the secretory pathway of β-cells is an established fact (see below). As measured by Tricine-urea-SDS-PAGE, exposure to increasing doses of DTT in vitro led to a stepwise mobility shift, confirming our ability to detect the integrity of the three disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). In vivo, although native disulfide bonds were intact immediately upon synthesis (Fig. 2), nearly all proinsulin disulfides appeared susceptible to low dose DTT (Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:A). The reduced proinsulin readily re-oxidized upon washout of DTT (Fig. 4); these features of extensive reduction and efficient reoxidation may be a specific reflection of the ER environment (Braakman et al., 1992; Valetti and Sitia, 1994). As a function of chase in pulse labeled pancreatic islets, proinsulin became nearly fully resistant to low dose DTT with a t (∼10 min) that closely approximates the t of proinsulin transport from the ER (Fig. 3). Thus, it initially seemed quite reasonable to think that conformational maturation such as hexamerization might be a rate-limiting step for proinsulin export. However, in islet β-cells producing abundant quantities of a mutant proinsulin that is unable to hexamerize (Gruppuso et al., 1984; Carroll et al., 1988), there are no obvious defects in transport of the mutant through the ER (nor the rest of the secretory pathway, as measured by proteolytic conversion to mutant insulin). During intracellular transport in normal β-cells, proinsulin encounters zinc, which in most species is required for homohexamerization (Bentley et al., 1992); furthermore, zinc stabilizes hexamer close-packing during insulin condensation (Emdin et al., 1980). Thus, proinsulin differs from most other exportable proteins in that even after achieving conformational competence, hexamerization does not proceed until the secretory protein reaches a compartment in which sufficient zinc is present (Gold and Grodsky, 1984), which has never been demonstrated in the ER. Thus, despite the kinetics showing acquisition of resistance to low dose DTT, proinsulin hexamerization in the ER cannot be assumed. When BFA was added to mouse islets in order to prevent protein export from the ER, the ability of proinsulin to acquire resistance to reduction with low dose DTT was fully inhibited (Fig. 5A). Since proinsulin receives no post-translational glycosylation that might influence monomer folding, this initial decrease in disulfide accessibility almost certainly signifies oligomeric assembly (see below). Because BFA has no direct inhibitory effects on protein folding or assembly (Doms et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1991; Russ et al., 1991; Collins and Mottet, 1992; and this report, Fig. 5B), the present data, taken together, indicate that while closely correlated with intracellular transport, proinsulin hexamer formation is unlikely to occur within the ER of pancreatic β-cells. It is believed that oligomeric assembly of proinsulin proceeds from folded monomers to homodimers to homohexamers (Emdin et al., 1980; Steiner et al., 1986). It is extremely unlikely that the conformational maturation reflected by disulfide resistance to low dose DTT (Fig. 3) represents either proinsulin monomer folding or dimerization (as opposed to hexamer formation), for several reasons. First, quality control mechanisms ensure that monomers are folded to an advanced stage prior to export from the ER (Copeland et al., 1988; Kim et al., 1992; Tatu et al., 1993), whereas proinsulin resistance to low dose DTT occurs after ER export (see above). Second, there is strong reason to suspect that proinsulin dimers can form within the β-cell ER, because in a manner dependent essentially only on protein concentration, monomers and dimers interconvert in dynamic equilibrium (Jeffrey and Coates, 1966). Third, unlike hexamers, proinsulin dimers have no zinc requirement for assembly and therefore should be able to form independently of intracellular transport (Blundell et al., 1972; Goldman and Carpenter, 1974; Emdin et al., 1980; Carroll et al., 1988). By contrast, the present data strongly support the view that in pancreatic β-cells, assembly of proinsulin hexamers occurs upon exit from the ER, whereupon proinsulin encounters zinc ions. If newly made proinsulin, chased to the Golgi complex, is intentionally diluted (by cell lysis) into a zinc-deficient medium, the molecules reacquire their previous sensitivity to low dose DTT (Fig. 6A). This is analogous to the ∼107-fold dilution of exocytosed granule cores into the hepatic portal bloodstream (which contains micromolar levels of zinc), causing near-instantaneous dissolution of condensed insulin into free insulin monomers (Gold and Grodsky, 1984). More importantly, when Golgi proinsulin is comparably diluted into a medium containing 0.5 mM zinc ions, resistance to low dose DTT is largely preserved (Fig. 6B). Based on our knowledge of proinsulin structure, these findings are very likely to signify stabilization of proinsulin hexamers as a consequence of zinc addition (Emdin et al., 1980). It must be emphasized that just because exportable proteins normally dimerize in the ER, it does not necessarily follow that folded monomers must be restrained from transport (Hoshina and Boime, 1982; Peters et al., 1984; Singh et al., 1990). Thus, it should not be surprising that a proinsulin mutant defective for homodimerization can in fact be transported through the secretory pathway (Quinn et al., 1991). The significance of this observation with respect to ER quality control remains unclear, since this finding is not based on studies of a homozygous mutation in β-cells, but rather represents the results from transfected heterologous cells where possible heterotypic proinsulin associations with abundant endogenous secretory proteins have not been excluded (Quinn et al., 1991). Thus, in pancreatic β-cells where proinsulin is the predominant secretory protein, previously published studies and the current results lead us to hypothesize that proinsulin normally forms dimers in the ER, but does not hexamerize. We propose that upon export from ER to Golgi, proinsulin encounters zinc and hexamerization proceeds. In the β-cells of pancreatic islets, most if not all condensation of regulated secretory protein begins in immature secretory granules, because proinsulin does not form higher order insoluble aggregates until after its proteolytic conversion to insulin (which takes place within this compartment (Huang and Arvan, 1994)). This conclusion is based upon the biophysical properties of proinsulin and insulin in vitro (Frank and Veros, 1968; Grant et al., 1972; Steiner, 1973; Emdin et al., 1980; Baker et al., 1988; Weiss et al., 1990; Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994). To complement these findings we have exploited disulfide accessibility in Golgi and post-Golgi compartments in vivo (Chanat et al., 1993; Tatu et al., 1993; Chanat et al., 1994), using high dose DTT to monitor further quaternary structural maturation of proinsulin during this stage of the secretory pathway (Fig. 7). After acquisition of resistance to low dose DTT, no further change in sensitivity of proinsulin disulfides occurred until shortly after the appearance of labeled insulin (Fig. 9). This was true in spite of experimental variation in proinsulin conversion rates and degrees of sensitivity to reduction between islet preparations. In some samples where processing to insulin neared completion (∼90% converted), small amounts of residual proinsulin also appeared to exhibit increased resistance to DTT; this is consistent with the reported ability of small quantities of proinsulin to participate in higher order insulin assemblies (Steiner, 1973). Moreover, insulin condensation in immature granules was clearly inhibited or enhanced by the presence of chloroquine or zinc, respectively (Fig. 10), in agreement with previous studies suggesting that not only do these agents alter the stability of the β-granule core (Kuliawat and Arvan, 1994), but zinc plays a role in insulin condensation that is over and above its role in proinsulin hexamer formation. In conclusion, the studies in this report support the notion that storage of insulin by formation of the β-granule core represents the culmination of a stepwise process of quaternary structural maturation in the secretory pathway (Carroll et al., 1988). Specifically, proinsulin exhibits at least three predominant conformational states that are reflected in three discrete stages of disulfide accessibility. We propose that proinsulin monomers and probably dimers within the ER are reduced maximally, proinsulin hexamers within the Golgi complex are reduced at an intermediate level, and insulin (and a small quantity of co-condensed proinsulin) forms higher order assemblies within secretory granules that are maximally resistant to disulfide reduction. Thus, at least in the β-cells of mouse pancreatic islets, condensation of insulin is predicated upon the prior formation of proinsulin hexamers, and both processes are facilitated by the presence of zinc. However, we must point out that at present, nothing is known about the mechanism by which zinc ions enter the secretory pathway in pancreatic β-cells; this will be an important area for future investigation. We thank members of the Arvan laboratory for help during the progress of these studies."
https://openalex.org/W2008703312,"Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) genomic mRNA codes for two gag precursors by alternative initiations of translation. An AUG codon governs the synthesis of the retroviral capsid proteins precursor, whereas a CUG codon directs the synthesis of a glycosylated cell surface antigen, the gross cell surface antigen. Control of the relative synthesis of the two precursors is crucial for MuLV infectivity and pathology. Furthermore, the MuLV mRNA leader sequence is very long and should inhibit translation according to the classical scanning model. This suggests a different translation initiation mechanism allowing gag efficient expression. We demonstrate, by using bicistronic vectors expressed in COS-7 cells, that the Mo-MuLV mRNA leader drives translation initiation by internal ribosome entry. We have localized the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) between the two initiation codons. This 126 nucleotide long IRES implies an oligopyrimidine tract located 45 nucleotides upstream of AUG codon. UV cross-linking and affinity chromatography experiments show that the PTB/p57 splicing factor specifically interacts with this oligopyrimidine tract. The MuLV IRES controls alternative translation initiation by activating the capsid protein precursor expression. This gag translational enhancer could exist in other retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W1999721692,"Shock temperatures of hydrogen up to 5200 kelvin were measured optically at pressures up to 83 gigapascals (830 kilobars). At highest pressures, the measured temperatures are substantially lower than predicted. These lower temperatures are caused by a continuous dissociative phase transition above 20 gigapascals. Because hydrogen is in thermal equilibrium in shock-compression experiments, the theory derived from the shock data can be applied to Jupiter. The planet's molecular envelope is cooler and has much less temperature variation than previously believed. The continuous dissociative phase transition suggests that there is no sharp boundary between Jupiter's molecular mantle and its metallic core. A possible convectively quiescent boundary layer might induce an additional layer in the molecular region, as has been predicted."

D'Ambrosio D. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 393-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This change in phosphorylation status of cellular proteins has two potential consequences. First, it may alter the enzymatic activity of certain proteins (e.g. PLCγ (2Padeh S. Levitsky A. Gazit A. Mills G.B. Roifman C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). Second, the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation provides a mechanism to accomplish specific interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins and can result in an altered subcellular distribution of proteins or protein complexes(3Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that two types of PTK are physically and functionally associated with the BCR. These include the src family members lyn, fyn, blk, and lck(4Yamanashi Y. Kakiuchi T.

Expression of CD45 is required for BCR signaling, because BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is severely affected in B cells lacking CD45(10Justement L.B. Campbell K.S. Chien N.C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The recent observation that CD45 may be physically associated with the BCR supports this notion(11Brown V.K. Ogle E.W. Burkhardt A.L. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17238-17244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A potential role for a second class of protein tyrosine phosphatase was suggested by the recent identification of the intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase 1C-hematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP) (12Yi T. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 836-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and Syp (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1D)(13Freeman R.M. Plutzky Jr., J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). HCP is mainly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, whereas Syp is ubiquitously expressed. Both protein tyrosine phosphatases are characterized by the presence of two SH2 domains, which provide them with the capacity to become recruited toward tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates(14Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Yi T. Mui A.L.F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Motheaten mice and viable Motheaten mice, which do not express or express aberrant forms of HCP protein, respectively(16Tsui H.W. Siminovitch K.A. De Souza L. Tsui F.W.L.

Green M.C. J. Immunol. 1976; 116: 936-943PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the molecular role of HCP in B cell signaling and differentiation is unknown. Because signals transmitted via the BCR are known to guide B cell development and differentiation, we decided to analyze the possible involvement of HCP in BCR signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSCellsThe Burkitt lymphoma cell line Daudi was routinely cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Tonsillar B cells were isolated from tonsils of healthy donors and purified as described previously (21van Noesel C.J.M. Brouns G.S. van Schijndel G.M.W. Bende R.J. Mason D.Y.

The δH chain mAb (δTA-4) was obtained from the ATCC. Antibodies directed against phosphotyrosine (RC20) and Shc were from Signal Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies specific for HCP were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingIntact cells and subcellular fractions were lysed with IMMUNOPRECIPITATION BUFFER (final concentration, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.01 M triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 0.02 mg/ml ovomucoid trypsin inhibitor, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mM vanadate, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 25 μM phenylarsine oxide) as described previously(22Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W.

Postnuclear debris and subcellular fractions were precleared by three incubations with 50 μl of a 10% (v/v) suspension of protein A-CL4B Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) coated with nonimmune mouse Ig, and once with protein A-Sepharose. Next, cell lysates were sequentially incubated with specific antibodies (15 min) and protein A-Sepharose (1.5 h). After washing in immunoprecipitation buffer, the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed as described previously(23Lankester A.C van Schijndel G.M.W. van Noesel C.J.M. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In short, after transfer to Hybond C nitrocellulose blots (Amersham Corp.), employing a semidry electroblotting chamber (Multiphore II, Pharmacia) and blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (Organon, Oss, The Netherlands), the proteins were detected with specific antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham; POD, Boehringer Mannheim). For sequential analysis of the same blot with distinct antibodies, deprobing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.B Cell ActivationThe cells were washed twice in Hepes solution (132 mM NaCl, 6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM K2HPO4, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.5% human serum albumin and 0.1% glucose) and kept at 4°C. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with purified biotinylated mAb for 3 min, pelleted by rapid centrifugation, and resuspended in Hepes solution containing 25 μg/ml streptavidin at 37°C for the indicated period of time. Following activation, the cells were either pelleted and lysed or resuspended in ice-cold sonication buffer.Subcellular FractionationFollowing stimulation, B cells (2-3 × 107) were resuspended in ice-cold sonication buffer (5% w/v sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). After sonication of the suspension (3 × 15 s at 21 kHz frequency and 9 μm peak-to-peak amplitude) and removal of unbroken cells and nuclei, 1 ml of postnuclear supernatant was layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 1.5 ml of 40% (w/v) sucrose and 1.5 ml of 15% (w/v) sucrose. After centrifugation (35,000 × g, 50 min), 80% of the supernatant (as source of cytosol) and the interface of the sucrose layers (as source of membranes) were collected and analyzed as indicated elsewhere(24Bolscher B.G.J.M. Denis S.W. Verhoeven A.J. Roos D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15782-15787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBCR Cross-linking Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of HCP and the Formation of a Multimolecular HCP ComplexPrevious reports have indicated that HCP may serve as substrate for src family protein tyrosine kinase(25Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Pei D. Walsh C.T. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1824-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 26Matozaki T. Uchida T. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since the BCR is functionally and physically coupled to several of these src family protein tyrosine kinase we have analyzed whether BCR ligation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of HCP. HCP was isolated from activated and nonactivated Daudi cells and was subsequently analyzed in anti-phosphotyrosine blots. Following activation, a moderately tyrosine phosphorylated HCP protein was detected that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa (Fig. 1, upper panel (arrow)). This protein reacted with anti-HCP antibodies (Fig. 1, lower panel). An additional tyrosine phosphorylated protein (arrow∗) was visualized that migrated only slightly slower than HCP but was nonreactive with anti-HCP antibodies (Fig. 1, lower panel). Next to HCP and the 68-70-kDa protein a very prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 130-135 kDa (<rif;) was detected in anti-HCP immunoprecipitates following BCR cross-linking. Similar results were obtained when HCP was isolated from tonsillar B cells (data not shown).Subcellular Distribution of Activation-induced HCP ComplexesSeveral studies have demonstrated that HCP interacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated transmembrane receptors in an activation-dependent manner(14Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Yi T. Mui A.L.F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Similarly, the phosphoproteins detected in anti-HCP immunoprecipitates might represent constituents of the BCR complex that serve to recruit HCP toward potential substrates associated with the BCR complex. When the anti-HCP immunoprecipitates were analyzed in anti-phosphotyrosine blots, HCP complexes with distinct features were observed in membrane and cytosolic fractions, respectively (Fig. 2, upper panel). Most of the HCP proteins resided in the cytosolic fraction, although after activation a slight decrease was observed (Fig. 2, lower panel). In activated B cells, cytosolic HCP proteins were moderately phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (arrow) and were associated with the 68-70-kDa phosphoprotein (arrow∗). However, a small amount of the HCP proteins (5-10%) was detected in the membrane fraction. In contrast to what was observed in the cytosolic fraction, neither tyrosine phosphorylation of the HCP protein nor of the 68-70-kDa protein was detected in the membrane fraction. Although it can not be excluded that the tyrosine phosphorylation of HCP proteins residing in the membrane fraction is below detection level, these findings argue against a preferential membrane translocation of tyrosine phosphorylated HCP proteins, which appears to be the case for Shc proteins(22Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M.W.

Daudi cells were stimulated for the indicated periods of time as described in Fig. 1and, prior to lysis, subcellular fractions were prepared by sonication. Next, HCP proteins were specifically recovered from the precleared membrane (m) and cytosolic (c) fractions and analyzed in anti-phosphotyrosine (upper panel) and anti-HCP Western blots (lower panel). Symbols are used as described in Fig. 1. Three additional experiments gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tyrosine-phosphorylated CD22 Acts as Membrane Target for HCPIn marked contrast to the 68-70-kDa phosphoprotein, the tyrosine-phosphorylated 130-135-kDa phosphoprotein was exclusively detected in association with the membrane-translocated HCP protein (Fig. 2, <rif;), indicating that this phosphoprotein possibly represents the membrane target of HCP. The fact that this 130-135-kDa phosphoprotein was not detected in HCP complexes from activated Jurkat cells (data not shown) suggested that this protein could be a B cell-specific transmembrane molecule. Among the B cell-specific transmembrane molecules that serve as a substrate for BCR-induced protein tyrosine kinase activity and are known to be involved in BCR signaling, the BCR complex-associated CD22 appeared to be a possible candidate(29Leprince C. Draves K.E. Geahlen R.L. Ledbetter J.A. Clark E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3236-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 30Peaker C.J.G. Neuberger M.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1358-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To investigate this hypothesis, anti-HCP and CD22 immunoprecipitates were isolated from activated Daudi cells, and half of each immunoprecipitate was directly analyzed in anti-phosphotyrosine blots. In accordance with previous reports, CD22 was detected as a 135-kDa tyrosine-phosporylated protein (Fig. 3, left panel)(31Schulte R.J. Campbell M.A. Fischer W.H. Sefton B.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Comparison with the HCP-associated 135-kDa phosphoprotein demonstrated that both proteins migrated at the same position in the SDS-PAGE, both under nonreducing (Fig. 3, left panel) and reducing conditions (data not shown). Treatment of the remaining half of the immunoprecipitates with N-glycanase prior to analysis in anti-phosphotyrosine blots revealed that both CD22 and the HCP-associated 135-kDa protein were deglycosylated and then still migrated at the same position following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, right panel). The apparent molecular mass of 100-105 kDa corresponds with the reported protein backbone of CD22(32Schwartz-Albiez R. Dorken B. Moldenhauer G. Knapp W. Dorken B. Gilks W.R. Rieber E.P. Schmidt R.E. Stein M. Kr. von dem Borne A.E.G. Leucocyte Typing IV. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 65-67Google Scholar). Definite evidence for the interaction of CD22 with HCP was obtained when CD22 immunoprecipitates, isolated from activated B cells, were analyzed in anti-HCP blots. In agreement with the subcellular fractionation experiments (see Fig. 2) only a small part of the total amount of HCP protein was found to interact with CD22 (Fig. 4). Densitometric analysis indicated that 5-10% of the total cellular HCP pool may associate with CD22 upon activation. The observation that in these parallel immunoprecipitations the phosphotyrosine content of HCP-associated CD22 is comparable with that of directly isolated CD22 suggests that most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated CD22 is bound by HCP.Figure 3:The HCP-associated 135-kDa glycoprotein comigrates with CD22. HCP and CD22 were specifically isolated from lysates of Daudi cells following activation as described in Fig. 1.

Likely, one or more phosphotyrosine-incorporating motifs within the CD22 cytoplasmic tail directly mediate the interaction with one or both SH2 domains of HCP. Indeed, some of these CD22 motifs share homology with the recently described erythropoietin receptor-derived phosphopeptides that display binding specificity for the amino-terminal SH2 domain of HCP(27Yi T. Zhang J. Miura O. Ihle J.N. Blood. 1995; 85: 87-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Leprince C. Draves K.E. Geahlen R.L. Ledbetter J.A. Clark E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3236-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The recruitment of HCP via CD22 into the BCR complex suggests that one or more BCR constituent(s) and/or associated tyrosine- phosphorylated proteins may serve as substrate for its tyrosine phosphatase activity. So far, we failed to detect substantial protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of HCP directed against BCR constituents in vitro (data not shown). However, the recent observation that recombinant HCP has the capacity to dephosphorylate the IL-3 receptor β-chain, c-fms and c-kit in vitro provides a precedent for this possibility(14Yi T.

The involvement of the phosphorylation status of HCP in its protein tyrosine phosphatase activity is still unresolved. The IL-3-induced association between the IL-3 receptor β-chain and HCP occurs without any significant alteration in HCP tyrosine phosphorylation and activity, while a marginal induction of HCP tyrosine phosphorylation was detected following c-fms and c-kit ligation, again without effect on its activation status. Our experiments indicate that tyrosine-phosphorylated HCP is preferentially localized in the cytosolic compartment (Fig. 2-4). Therefore tyrosine phosphorylation of HCP might facilitate the potential interactions with other cytosolic proteins incorporating SH2 domains.Previous studies in Motheaten mice, which lack HCP protein, have demonstrated the importance of HCP in B cell differentiation(18Sidman C.L. Schultz L.D. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 2392-2404PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schultz L.D. Green M.C. J. Immunol. 1976; 116: 936-943PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sidman C.I. Schultz L.D. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 2399-2404PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of the B cells in these mice belong to the CD5+ subset, which is thought to be responsible for the production of autoreactive antibodies(34Sidman C.L. Schultz L.D. Hardy R.R. Hayakawa K. Herzenberg L.A. Science. 1986; 232: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported structural and functional differences between the BCR in CD5+ and conventional B cells, respectively(23Lankester A.C van Schijndel G.M.W. van Noesel C.J.M. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Zupo S. Dono M. Azzoni L. Chiorazzi N. Ferrarini M. Eur. J.

This may indicate that BCR signals required for differentiation of the former subset operate relatively independent of HCP or that the presence of CD5 within the BCR complex somehow compensates for this defect. However, another explanation could be that HCP is involved in the BCR-mediated deletion of autoreactive B cells. Lack of HCP expression might thus deregulate this selection process. Recently, Cyster and Goodnow (39Cyster J.G. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1995; 2: 13-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that such a mechanism may indeed be operative.BCR-induced protein tyrosine kinase activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of several accessory molecules, including CD5(23Lankester A.C van Schijndel G.M.W. van Noesel C.J.M. van Lier R.A.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), CD19(40Tuveson D.A. Carter R.H. Soltoff S.P. Fearon D.T. Science. 1993; 260: 986-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and CD22(31Schulte R.J. Campbell M.A. Fischer W.H. Sefton B.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), creating potential binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins. Indeed, it has been shown that tyrosine-phosphorylated CD19 serves as a specific and preferential binding site for the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (40Tuveson D.A. Carter R.H. Soltoff S.P. Fearon D.T. Science. 1993; 260: 986-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Our present finding that CD22 specifically recruits HCP provides further support for this function of accessory molecules. Thus, accessory molecules appear to have a dual function. They have the capacity to cooperate with the BCR at the extracellular level in the process of antigen recognition(41van Noesel C.J.M. Lankester A.C. van Lier R.A.W. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 8-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42Law C.L. Sidorenko S.V. Clark E.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 442-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition, they provide the BCR with molecular substrates to couple to specific intracellular activation pathways. INTRODUCTIONAntigen receptor-mediated B cell activation critically depends on the regulated activities of both protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases. Early after BCR 1The abbreviations used are: BCRB cell antigen receptorHCPhematopoietic cell phosphatasemAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisILinterleukinCLBCentral Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. cross-linking a large number of cellular proteins become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues(1Pleiman C.M. D'Ambrosio D. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 393-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This change in phosphorylation status of cellular proteins has two potential consequences. First, it may alter the enzymatic activity of certain proteins (e.g. PLCγ (2Padeh S. Levitsky A. Gazit A. Mills G.B. Roifman C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). Second, the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation provides a mechanism to accomplish specific interactions with SH2 domain-containing proteins and can result in an altered subcellular distribution of proteins or protein complexes(3Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that two types of PTK are physically and functionally associated with the BCR. These include the src family members lyn, fyn, blk, and lck(4Yamanashi Y. Kakiuchi T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12310-12319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to the considerable number of protein tyrosine kinase that are known to be involved in BCR signaling, studies on the contribution of protein tyrosine phosphatase have so far been restricted to the CD45 protein. Expression of CD45 is required for BCR signaling, because BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is severely affected in B cells lacking CD45(10Justement L.B. Campbell K.S. Chien N.C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The recent observation that CD45 may be physically associated with the BCR supports this notion(11Brown V.K. Ogle E.W. Burkhardt A.L. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17238-17244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A potential role for a second class of protein tyrosine phosphatase was suggested by the recent identification of the intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase 1C-hematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP) (12Yi T. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 836-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and Syp (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1D)(13Freeman R.M. Plutzky Jr., J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). HCP is mainly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, whereas Syp is ubiquitously expressed. Both protein tyrosine phosphatases are characterized by the presence of two SH2 domains, which provide them with the capacity to become recruited toward tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates(14Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Yi T. Mui A.L.F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Motheaten mice and viable Motheaten mice, which do not express or express aberrant forms of HCP protein, respectively(16Tsui H.W. Siminovitch K.A. De Souza L. Tsui F.W.L. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 17Schultz L.D. Schweitzer P.A. Rajan T.V. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Matthews R.J. Thomas M.L. Beier D.R.

Schultz L.D. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 2392-2404PubMed Google Scholar, 19Greiner D.L. Goldschneider I. Komschlies K.L. Medlock E.S. Bollum F.J. Schultz L. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1129-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Clinically, Motheaten mice suffer from severe autoimmune diseases and severe combined immunodeficiency syndromes(20Schultz L.D. Green M.C. J. Immunol. 1976; 116: 936-943PubMed Google Scholar). At present, the molecular role of HCP in B cell signaling and differentiation is unknown. Because signals transmitted via the BCR are known to guide B cell development and differentiation, we decided to analyze the possible involvement of HCP in BCR signaling."

In none of these studies has a full-length recombinant DM kinase protein control been available to prove DM kinase identity and antibody specificity. We have expressed a full-length recombinant DM kinase protein in COS and BC3H1 cells and shown that the DM kinase protein is expressed as 71- and 80-kDa mobility forms, and that these prior reports are incorrect. Both DM kinase forms are found and differentially expressed in human muscle tissues. Analysis of the expression and subcellular localization of the DM kinase in normal human heart and skeletal muscle implicate highly specialized cellular structures, the intercalated discs and the neuromuscular junctions, as potential subcellular targets for cell dysfunction in DM. A full-length coding-only DM kinase cDNA construct was generated by PCR with primers spanning sequences encoding the first in-frame methionine to the downstream termination codon, as determined from the published sequence(12Mahadevan M.S. Amemiya C.T. Jansen G. Sabourin L. Baird S. Neville C.E. Wormskamp N. Segers B. Lamerdin J. de Jong P. Wieringa B. Korneluk R.G. Hum. Mol.

Primers were designed such that EcoRI sites would be added to the termini of the amplified region: forward primer (5′-GGCCGAATTCATGTCAGCCGAGGTGCGG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CCGGGAATTCCAGGGAGCGCGGGCGGC-3′). A 1895-base pair PCR product was amplified and cloned into the EcoRI site of the eukaryotic expression vector PCDNA3 (Invitrogen). This clone was sequenced and compared to published sequence to verify authenticity (Sequenase), and designated PCDNA3 DMK. COS cells (ATCC) were grown in T75 flasks with 10 ml of COS cell medium (DMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% calf serum (HyClone), 10 mM Hepes (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 4 mML-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.)). PCDNA3 DMK (10 μg/flask) was transfected using the Pharmacia CellPhect transfection system. Briefly, the culture medium was aspirated and the COS cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 10 μg of PCDNA3 DMK was added to each flask with 3 ml of DMEM medium (serum-free) and 300 μl of DEAE. After 3 h of incubation at 37°C the transfection mixture was removed and the cells were incubated with 10% Me2SO in DMEM (serum-free) for 60 s at room temperature. The cells were washed twice in DMEM, 10 ml of COS cell medium was added to each flask and incubated at 37°C for 48-72 h. COS cells were harvested by scraping, followed by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was suspended in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), containing 0.1% Triton X-114, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (300 μl/flask), and subjected to five freeze/thaw cycles with dry ice and a 37°C water bath. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 9000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant containing recombinant DM kinase was aspirated and used for Western blotting. Human left ventricular heart samples and cardiac Purkinje fibers were obtained from three normal donor hearts intended for transplantation (recipient not available), three explanted hearts from patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and one from a patient with Becker muscular dystrophy and severe cardiomyopathy. Cardiac Purkinje fibers were isolated as described previously(16Sommer J.R. Johnson E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle samples were obtained from non-myotonic patients via needle or open biopsy. Three patients with DM were examined in this study. Patient 1 with DM (DM 1) was a 42-year-old male with cataracts, progressive weakness, and diffuse myotonia by nerve conduction and electromyography studies. Skeletal muscle biopsy was performed from left quadriceps. Patient 2 with DM (DM 2) was a 47-year-old female with myotonia and muscle weakness. Skeletal muscle biopsy was performed from left deltoid. Patient 3 with DM (DM 3) was a 48-year-old female with mild myotonia, muscle weakness, severe bradycardia, and diffuse T wave abnormality on electrocardiogram, who required pacemaker implantation for syncope and hypotension. She had normal left ventricular function. Cardiac tissue was obtained by endomyocardial biopsy of the right ventricle. All samples were quickly frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until assayed. Anti-DM kinase antibodies used in this study were produced in New Zealand White rabbits immunized with a recombinant fusion protein encoding C-terminal amino acids 471-629 of the human DM kinase gene (courtesy of R. G. Korneluk). Homogenates of cardiac ventricular tissue, Purkinje fibers, and skeletal muscle were prepared as described previously(17Bies R.D. Friedman D. Roberts R. Perryman M.B. Caskey C.T. Circulation. 1992; 86: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of tissue homogenates were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Proteins were resolved electrophoretically in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and stained with DM kinase antibody (1:2000 dilution) using previously described methods (17Bies R.D. Friedman D. Roberts R. Perryman M.B. Caskey C.T. Circulation. 1992; 86: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution, Amersham Corp.) and an enhanced chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Amersham). Differences in gel loading were examined by reprobing the membrane with anti-cadherin antibody (1:2000 dilution, Sigma) in heart to assess abundance of the intercalated disc protein cadherin, or staining the 10% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue to assess myosin abundance in each sample lane. Unfixed frozen tissue specimens were cut into 6-μm sections and placed on Superfrost microscope slides (Fisher). The sections were stained with anti-DM kinase antibody (1:100 dilution) or anti-cadherin antibody (1:200 dilution, Sigma). Anti-cadherin antibody was selected as a control in heart where it specifically localizes at the fascia adherens of the intercalated disc (18Geiger B. Volberg T. Ginsberg D. Bitzur S. Sabanay I. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 607-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent detection with fluorescein or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) were performed using previously described methods(17Bies R.D. Friedman D. Roberts R. Perryman M.B. Caskey C.T. Circulation. 1992; 86: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Tetramethyl rhodamine-labeled α-bungarotoxin (1:100 dilution, Molecular Probe) was selected as control staining for the neuromuscular junction(19Astrow S.H. Sutton L.A. Thompson W.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1605-1615Crossref Google Scholar). Staining with secondary antibodies alone were used as controls for nonspecific fluorescence. The stained sections were photographed under ultraviolet light with a Nikon microscope. In order to confirm the specificity of immunostaining for DM kinase in the heart, we performed subcellular isolation of intercalated disc structures as described by Green and Severs (20Green C.R. Severs N.J. Tissue Cell. 1983; 15: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. One gram of fresh human heart tissue was homogenized at low speed with a Polytron tissue homogenizer in 30 ml of 1 mM sodium bicarbonate. After a low speed centrifugation (750 × g, for 5 min), supernatant was removed by aspiration (supernatant 1). The pellet was resuspended with sodium bicarbonate, and low speed centrifugation was repeated twice (supernatants 2 and 3). A mixture of 65 ml of sodium bicarbonate, 8% sucrose, 0.6 M KCl was added to the pellet, and the resuspended solution stirred in the cold room at 4°C for 4 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min (supernatant 4). The final crude membrane pellet, containing intercalated discs, and the supernatants(1 −4) were used for Western blotting. The soluble protein fraction from supernatant 1 was isolated by loading on top of a sucrose step gradient (0, 25, 37, 45, and 54% sucrose layers) and centrifugation at 98,000 × g for 90 min. Low to high sucrose gradient fractions were then carefully pipetted from the top surface of the tube and analyzed by Western blotting for DM kinase. Total protein concentration was determined for each purification step. The membrane was first probed for DM kinase, stripped, and reprobed with anti-cadherin antibody to verify intercalated disc isolation in the pellet fraction. Biochemical characterization of human DM kinase was explored by recombinant protein expression, Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry of human tissue, and subcellular fractionation of the protein. Western blot analysis of COS cells transfected with the full-length DM kinase cDNA using anti-DM kinase antibody demonstrated specific immunoreactive proteins compared to control untransfected COS cells, which contained no immunoreactive material (Fig. 1). Two major protein bands at 80 and 71 kDa were specifically detected in the transfected COS cells, suggesting that previous studies of 50-62-kDa proteins were probably not DM gene products (Fig. 1). Proteins with the same apparent molecular weight were also detected in transfected BC3H1 cells (data not shown). Human heart contained a doublet with similar staining intensity of both proteins at 80 and 71 kDa (Fig. 1), and no smaller protein forms were observed. The in vitro recombinantly expressed proteins were similar to that detected in human cardiac and skeletal muscle and probably represents two mobility forms of DM kinase. The two protein forms detected in heart had differential expression in other tissues. Human skeletal muscle demonstrated a predominance of the upper 80-kDa immunoreactive protein with only faint staining of the 71-kDa protein. In contrast, human cardiac Purkinje fibers expressed the 71-kDa protein as the major form (Fig. 1). The 71-kDa protein does not appear to be a degradation product of the 80-kDa form, and neither form appears to be glycosylated, since exposing the two forms to boiling, prolonged incubation at 65°C, 10% nonionic detergents (Triton X, Nonidet P-40), or glycolytic cleavage enzymes (endoglycosidase H, N-glycosidase F, Boehringer Mannheim) did not alter their molecular size (data not shown). To determine whether DM kinase displays a specific subcellular structure for its localization, immunostaining of DM kinase in human tissues was performed. Cardiac myocytes and Purkinje fibers demonstrated specific subcellular localization to the intercalated discs (Fig. 2, A and C). There were no obvious differences in staining pattern between cardiac muscle and Purkinje fibers despite the apparent differences in mobility forms noted on Western blotting of these tissues (Fig. 1). The staining pattern was identical to that obtained with anti-cadherin antibody, which specifically labels the fascia adherens at the intercalated discs in heart tissue (Fig. 2B). Immunostaining of human skeletal muscle with anti-DM kinase antibody demonstrated specific localization to the motor endplate of the neuromuscular junctions (Fig. 2D), by double staining with a rhodamine-labeled α-bungarotoxin (Fig. 2E). We further analyzed the nature of DM kinase association with structures in the heart using the methods described by Green and Severs for partial purification of intercalated discs(20Green C.R. Severs N.J. Tissue Cell. 1983; 15: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Most of the DM kinase was easily dissociated from the final pellet, but small amount of the total DM kinase remained in the crude membrane fraction containing intercalated discs (Fig. 3). Supernatants 1 and 2 from this preparation contained both DM kinase mobility forms noted in whole heart homogenates. High speed centrifugation of the supernatant in a sucrose gradient showed that both forms were found in the top layer and demonstrates that these are soluble proteins (data not shown). The predominance of soluble DM kinase in cell homogenate supernatant suggests that the putative transmembrane domain proposed by sequence analysis of DM kinase (21Perryman M.B. Friedman D.L. Fu Y.H. Caskey C.T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) does not confer a strong membrane interaction. This observation is consistent with the fact that most serine-threonine protein kinases are soluble and not membrane-bound. Interestingly, our preparations consistently contained more of the smaller 71-kDa DM kinase form in the supernatant, while the 80-kDa DM kinase form was the major form isolated in the crude membrane pellet. The affinity of DM kinase for these specialized structures may thus vary between the 80- and 71-kDa forms, yet the nature of these interactions are unknown. To control for the stability of the preparation, we reprobed the membrane with anti-cadherin antibody. Cadherin, which is localized to the intercalated discs, was almost exclusively found in the crude membrane pellet (Fig. 3B). Because the pellet contains other cellular particulate matter, our observations do not prove that the 80-kDa form is associated with the intercalated disc. To test whether DM kinase expression is altered in myotonic dystrophy, a few fresh frozen skeletal muscle samples from 2 DM patients (DM 1 and 2) were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4). We found an obvious decrease in DM kinase abundance in affected skeletal muscle. Heart tissue from a DM patient (DM 3) also showed low abundance of both forms of DM kinase (Fig. 4). DM kinase was not diminished in cardiac tissue from other forms of cardiomyopathy. This preliminary observation suggests that, if DM is a disease of DM kinase deficiency, then haplotype insufficiency is the likely mechanism for autosomal dominant disease expression. A dominant disease expressed via haplotype insufficiency can occur in mutations of structural proteins or enzymes in critical metabolic pathways(22Warmke J.W. Kreuz A.J. Falkenthal S. Genetics. 1989; 122: 139-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Barbas J.A. Galceran J. Krah I. de la Pompa J.L. Canal I. Pongs O. Ferrus A. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Purkinje conduction system of the heart is a highly specialized group of cells, which exhibit a 4-fold increase in conduction velocity and a high number of intercellular connections, gap junctions, and desmosomes in the intercalated disc, compared to the disc structure in normal cardiac myocytes(24Legato M.J. The Myocardial Cell for the Clinical Cardiologist. Futura Publishing Co., New York1973: 131-175Google Scholar). Electrophysiologic studies have shown that the His-Purkinje system is damaged in DM, and this conduction disturbance becomes progressively worse with age(25Prystowsky E.N. Pritchett E.L.C. Roses A.D. Gallagher A.J. Circulation. 1979; 60: 1360-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The relationship between the localization and expression of DM kinase and the observed clinical phenotype is not clear. One report has described reduced myocardial glucose phosphorylation in the hearts of DM subjects(26Annane D. Duboc D. Mazoyer B. Merlet P. Fiorelli M. Eymard B. Radvanyi H. Junien C. Fardeau M. Philippe G. Guerin F. Syrota A. Circulation. 1994; 90: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently another group has shown that increased CTG repeat length is correlated with the severity of conduction abnormalities(7Melacini P. Villanova C. Menegazzo E. Novelli G. Danieli G. Rizzoli G. Fasoli G. Angelini C. Buja G. Miorelli M. Dallapiccola B. Volta S.D. J. Am. Coll.Cardiol. 1995; 25: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this report, we described a DM patient with severe bradycardia, who had decreased myocardial DM kinase expression as detected by Western blotting. Thus, the observation that DM kinase is expressed in the specialized conduction cells of the heart may be important to the common cardiac conduction defects found in DM patients. The two major immunoreactive proteins of 80 and 71 kDa detected in normal tissues, and by recombinant protein synthesis in COS cells, are different from the putative DM kinase protein described by other investigators(8Fu Y.H. Friedman D.L. Richards S. Pearlman J.A. Gibbs R.A. Pizzuti A. Ashizawa T. Perryman M.B. Scarlato G. Fenwick Jr., R.G. Caskey C.T.

Commun. 1994; 202: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass of DM kinase from the cDNA coding sequence is 69 kDa(12Mahadevan M.S. Amemiya C.T. Jansen G. Sabourin L. Baird S. Neville C.E. Wormskamp N. Segers B. Lamerdin J. de Jong P. Wieringa B. Korneluk R.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), close to the 71-kDa form described in this report. It is thus tempting to speculate that the 71-kDa form is the nascent full-length DM kinase protein and that the 80-kDa protein form has been modified in the cell. The two immunoreactive proteins seen in normal tissues and transfected COS cells are not produced via alternative splicing since they were derived from a single cDNA construct transfected into COS cells. A recent study demonstrated an increase in molecular size of DM kinase fusion protein after phosphorylation(27Dunne P.W. Walch E.T. Epstein H.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10809-10814Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that post-translational protein modification or phosphorylation state may be responsible for the two different mobility forms detected in SDS-PAGE. Numerous reports have attempted to define the cellular localization of DM kinase. Because our data conflict in part with these reports, several comments should be made. Van der Ven et al.(13Van der Ven P.F.M. Jansen G. Van Kuppevelt T.H.M.S.M. Perryman M.B. Lupa M. Dunne P.W. Laak H.J.T. Jap P.H.K. Veerkamp J.H. Epstein H.F. Wieringa B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1889-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) described immunolocalization of a 53-kDa protein at the neuromuscular junctions, myotendinous junctions and the cytoplasm of type 1 skeletal muscle fibers, and intercalated discs in the heart. Interestingly, their antibody also detected a larger molecular size protein of ~80 kDa, which may represent activity against both DM kinase and the 53-kDa protein. The fact that other studies have shown similar immunolocalization data of a ~50-54-kDa protein does not detract from our results. Other proteins such as utrophin localize to neuromuscular junctions and intercalated discs(28Ohiendiech K. Ervasti J.M. Matsumura K. Kahl S.D. Leveille C.J. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1991; 7: 499-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 29Pons F. Robert A. Fabbrizio E. Hugon G. Califano J. Fehrentz J.A. Martinez J. Mornet D. Circulation. 1994; 90: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and this report demonstrates that the 71- and 80-kDa DM kinase proteins localize specifically to these structures. This study demonstrates that the protein product of the DM gene is translated as 71- and 80-kDa proteins in striated muscle tissues and displays tissue-specific variation in the expression of these two forms. DM kinase is localized to specialized cell structures in both heart and skeletal muscle that are associated with intercellular conduction and impulse transmission. However, because DM kinase remains uncharacterized biochemically and physiologically, no conclusions can be made regarding its role in the cell Anti-DM kinase antibody was kindly provided by R. G. Korneluk."

Since many hormones that regulate cardiac contractility have also been found to modulate intracellular pH (pHi) the goal of this study was to determine if AngII altered pHi in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Changes in pHi were monitored in single cells using the fluorescent pH indicator carboxy-seminaphthorhodafluor-1. Application of 100 nM AngII resulted in a rapid, receptor-mediated alkalinization of 0.08 ± 0.02 pH unit. The Na+/H+ exchanger was not involved since the response was HCO3--dependent and amiloride-insensitive. Ammonia rebound experiments showed AngII increased the initial rate of recovery from an imposed acid load by 3.15-fold and showed that the hormone led to the selective activation of the Na+/HCO3- symport. In contrast, phorbol ester activation of protein kinase C led to the selective activation of Na+/H+ antiport in these cells. Pharmacological studies showed that the alkalinization was independent of the AngII receptor subtype 1 (AT1) phosphoinositide signaling path. In contrast, AngII activation of the symport was blocked by nanomolar AT2 receptor antagonist PD 123319. Superfusion of the myocytes with exogenous arachidonic acid (5 μM) mimicked the AngII-mediated alkalinization, further suggesting that the AT2 signaling pathway underlies the response. In summary, while most of the known actions of AngII in heart are mediated through AT1 receptors, activation of the Na+/HCO3- symport occurs through a distinct alternative path that is likely related to fatty acid production.

https://openalex.org/W2038567895,"The regulation of the lysophospholipase activity of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was studied in vitro and in stimulated macrophages. Bovine serum albumin was found to inhibit lysophospholipase activity of the recombinant 85-kDa PLA2 when assayed at a relatively low substrate concentration. Inhibition could be reversed if the substrate concentration was increased or if Ca2+ was present in the assay. Incubation of recombinant enzyme with macrophage membranes and lipid extracts from macrophage membranes resulted in the release of arachidonic acid, as well as, stearic acid, which is enriched at the sn-1 position of macrophage phospholipids. This suggests that with a bilayer substrate the PLA2 can sequentially deacylate the sn-2 then sn-1 acyl groups. This was verified by demonstrating that the phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol, were hydrolyzed to glycerophosphocholine and glycerophosphoinositol by incubation with recombinant 85-kDa PLA2. The 85-kDa enzyme was identified as the main lysophospholipase activity in mouse peritoneal macrophage cytosols. Addition of Ca2+ to the assay enhanced activity, but this effect decreased as the substrate concentration was increased. Incubation of macrophages with zymosan increased the lysophospholipase activity of the 85-kDa PLA2 in cytosols.

Arachidonic acid can be metabolized to a number of potent proinflammatory eicosanoids. In addition, arachidonic acid itself can act as a second messenger and modulate a number of cellular functions(1Axelrod J. Burch R.M. Jelsema C.L. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 117-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Lysophospholipids occur naturally at low levels (0.5-6%) in membranes of unstimulated cells and are produced transiently during phospholipid remodeling reactions (2Stafford R.E. Dennis E.A.

Recent studies suggest that lysophospholipids themselves can cause a variety of cellular responses such as changes in intracellular Ca2+ and modulation of chemotaxis(5Stoll L.L. Spector A.A. Am. J.

Accumulation of lysophospholipid can be controlled by reacylation to phospholipid or by metabolism to water soluble glycerophosphocholine by lysophospholipases.

Whether the 85-kDa PLA2 acts as a lysophospholipase in vivo and whether its lysophospholipase activity is regulated during cell activation is not currently known. Simultaneous activation of both PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities of the 85-kDa enzyme would provide an efficient mechanism for regulation of levels of arachidonic acid and lysophospholipid. There is now substantial evidence that both phosphorylation of the 85-kDa PLA2 and Ca2+-dependent translocation to the membrane are necessary for activation of the PLA2 resulting in arachidonic acid release(13Lin L.-L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). In this study we have examined whether the lysophospholipase activity of the 85-kDa PLA2 is regulated in zymosan-stimulated macrophages and whether it functions as a lysophospholipase under physiological conditions. Pathogen-free female ICR mice (8 weeks old) were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley. Zymosan, aprotinin, leupeptin, potato acid phosphatase, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, glycerophosphocholine, glycerophosphoinositol, bovine liver phosphatidylinositol, and ATP were obtained from Sigma. 1-Palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-PC was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. 1-[14C]Palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-PC (57 mCi/mmol), [methyl-3H]choline chloride (81 Ci/mmol), L-α-[myo-inositol-2-3H]phosphatidylinositol (11 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Hank's balanced salts solution were from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Zymosan was prepared for use as described previously(14Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One mg of zymosan is equivalent to approximately 1.3 × 107 particles. Recombinant MAP kinase (ERK 2), which had been activated with MAP kinase kinase, was generously provided by Dr. Lee Graves, University of Washington, Seattle, WA. 1-O-Hexadecyl-2-[3H]arachidonoyl-PC was prepared as described in detail elsewhere(15Leslie C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; : 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinant baculovirus-derived PLA2 as described previously(16de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant virus containing the PLA2 gene as described previously(16de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 65-70 h post-infection by scraping into 10 mM HEPES, 10% glycerol, 0.34 M sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Buffer A) containing the phosphatase inhibitors 100 mM sodium fluoride, 3 μMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate. Cell suspensions were then sonicated for 50 s and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The cytosolic fraction was removed, stored at −20°C and thawed once before assay. Resident mouse peritoneal cells were isolated as described previously and plated at a density of 20-25 × 106 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish(17Qiu Z.H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with zymosan (30 particles/cell) for 30 min, scraped into Buffer A, and then lysed by sonication for 10 s at 0°C. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g, for 5 min at 4°C to remove whole cells and then the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C to obtain the cytosolic and membrane fractions. Lysophospholipase activity was assayed using sonicated dispersions of 1-[14C]palmitoyl-lyso-PC (100,000-200,000 dpm/assay) with a final substrate concentration of 50-200 μM. For assays using macrophage cytosols, 10 μg of cytosolic protein was incubated for 2 min in 50 μl of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, with or without 5 mM CaCl2. For assays using PLA2 in Sf9 cytosols 0.4 μg of cytosolic protein was incubated for 30 s, which was within the linear range of the reaction, in a total volume of 50 μl of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6. For assays with added BSA and/or 5 mM Ca2+ these were incubated with the substrate 10 min at 37°C prior to the addition of cytosol. The assay was stopped by the addition of 1.25 ml of Dole reagent(18Dole V.P. Meinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid (20 μg) was added as carrier lipid and then 100 μg of silica was added. The tubes were vortexed followed by the addition of 0.75 ml of heptane and 0.75 ml of water. The tubes were vortexed, the upper heptane phase removed, and the radiolabeled fatty acids released measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For measuring PLA2 activity, assays contained 1-hexadecyl-2-[3H]arachidonoyl-PC (30 μM) (100,000 dpm/assay) cosonicated with 9 μM dioleoylglycerol, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, for macrophage cytosols or in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, for recombinant PLA2. For PLA2 assays using macrophage cytosol, 25 μg of cytosolic protein was added, and the reaction was incubated 10 min at 37°C. PLA2 assays with purified recombinant PLA2 used 40 ng of enzyme purified as described previously and a reaction time of 30 s, which was within the linear range of the reaction(16de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2.5 ml of Dole reagent(18Dole V.P. Meinertz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2595-2599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid (20 μg) was added as carrier lipid, and the radiolabeled fatty acids released were extracted and separated by silicic acid chromatography as described previously(10Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 100,000 × g membrane pellet, prepared from macrophages as described above, was resuspended in Buffer A containing 100 μg/ml of fatty acid-free BSA and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C to remove any free fatty acids. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.6, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and then resuspended in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.6. Macrophage membranes were also extracted and lipid phosphorus determined as described previously(19Dawson R.M. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Membranes (20 μg of protein) or sonicated lipids extracted from 10 μg of membrane protein (0.7 μg of lipid phosphorus) were incubated with purified PLA2 (50 ng) in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, containing 1 mM CaCl2, 100 μg/ml of fatty acid-free BSA, 150 mM NaCl at 37°C with shaking in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of ice-cold methanol, to which was added 50 ng of [13C4]palmitic acid, 50 ng [2H3]stearic acid, 10 ng of [2H2]oleic acid, and 10 ng of [2H8]arachidonic acid. The solution was acidified by the addition of 50 μl of 1 N HCl. The fatty acids were extracted into isooctane, then derivatized to their pentafluorobenzyl esters as described previously(21Strife R.J. Murphy R.C. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 305: 3-12Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Fatty acid pentafluorobenzyl esters were resuspended in decane and analyzed by temperature-programmed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Finnigan SSQ 70 quadrupole mass spectrometer, San Jose, CA). The gas chromatograph utilized a DB-1 column (10 m, 250-μm inner diameter, and 0.25-μm film) (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) and helium as a carrier gas. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion chemical ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. Amounts of fatty acids were determined by stable isotope dilution calibration curves. Carboxylate anion signals were obtained by selected ion recording of ions of target fatty acids and ratioed to the carboxylate anion from the corresponding stable isotope labeled fatty acids (internal standards). [3H]Choline-labeled macrophage lipids were prepared by labeling macrophages with [methyl-3H]choline (20 μCi/20 × 106 cells) in 60-mm dishes for 17 h. Macrophage lipids were extracted, and the labeled PC was purified by HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard series 1050 system with a variable wavelength detector set at 205 nm(20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The lipid extract was applied to a 250 × 4.6-mm Phenomenex column packed with Lichrosorb 5 Sil 60A which was equilibrated in 47% solvent B (hexane/isopropanol/water, 300:400:70) in solvent A (hexane/isopropanol, 300:400). Using a flow rate of 1 ml/min, the solvent was held at 47% solvent B for 6 min followed by a 20-min linear gradient from 47% solvent B to 100% solvent B. The solvent was then held at 100% solvent B until 60 min. The [3H]choline-labeled PC eluted at approximately 35 min. The [3H]PC (250,000 dpm/assay) or [3H]PI (85,000 dpm/assay) (obtained from DuPont NEN) were sonicated and used at a final concentration of 70 μM. They were also tested as substrates after cosonication with extracted macrophage membrane lipid resulting in a final concentration of phospholipid of 530 μM for the experiments with PC and 490 μM for the experiments with PI. The substrates were incubated with purified PLA2 (100 ng) in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, containing 1 mM CaCl2, 100 μg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, and 150 mM NaCl at 37°C in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of methanol. Lipids were extracted, and the organic and aqueous phases analyzed separately by TLC by comparison with appropriate standards(20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). For analysis of lyso-PC and PC the organic phase was separated on Analtech Silica Gel G plates using the solvent system CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3CO2H/H2O (100:50:16:8). For analysis of lyso-PI and PI, the organic phase was separated on Analtech Silica gel H plates using the solvent system CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH (28%) (45:45:2.5). For analysis of GPC and GPI the aqueous phase was separated on Silica Gel G plates using the solvent system CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH (28%) (30:50:25). The aqueous phase was also analyzed for any lyso-PC and lyso-PI. Lyso-PC carryover in the aqueous phase was negligible. Lyso-PI was found in the aqueous phase (approximately 40% of total), but was separated from GPI using the above TLC conditions for analysis of the aqueous phase (RF lyso-PI = 0.75, RF GPI = 0.34). Silica was scraped into 1 ml of H20, and radiolabeled lipids were detected by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Macrophages were plated at 1 × 106 cells/2 cm2 (24-well plate) and stimulated with zymosan (30 particles/cell) in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of serum for indicated times as described previously(14Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were scraped into ice-cold methanol (0.5 ml) and the free fatty acids released analyzed as described above. For preparation of phosphorylated PLA2, cytosol from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant virus was prepared in Buffer A containing the phosphatase inhibitors 100 mM sodium fluoride, 3 μMp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate. For preparation of dephosphorylated PLA2, cytosol from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant virus was prepared in Buffer A without phosphatase inhibitors and treated with acid phosphatase. Potato acid phosphatase, which is supplied at 1 mg/ml in 3.2 M (NH4)2SO4 pH 6.0, containing 10 mg/ml BSA, was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, pH 7.0. Cytosols were treated with dialyzed phosphatase (60 units/mg of cytosolic protein) for 1 h at 30°C in 100 mM HEPES, pH 6.0, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or treated with a similar solution containing an equivalent amount of BSA instead of phosphatase. Reactions were adjusted to 12.5% ethylene glycol in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.6, and then loaded onto a Mono Q (HR 5/5) column which had been equilibrated with 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 10% glycerol and 230 mM NaCl. Fractions (0.5 ml) were eluted with a 40-ml gradient from 230 to 400 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Dithiothreitol (1 mM) was added to the fractions for long term storage at −20°C. Dephosphorylated PLA2 (84 ng), which had been separated by Mono Q chromatography, was incubated with MAP kinase (175 ng) in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μM ATP in a 200-μl reaction volume for 1 h at 30°C. Parallel samples were run containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/200 μl of assay. PLA2 and lysophospholipase activity was then assayed using 25 μl of the reaction mixture as described above for the purified enzyme. To detect the gel shift on Western blots, a portion of the sample was boiled in Laemmli buffer, and proteins were resolved using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide separating gel made using a pH 8.3 Tris buffer and a concentration of bisacrylamide that was decreased to 1% of the total acrylamide(22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gel was run an additional 1 h and 40 min after the dye front had run off. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated for 2 h with polyclonal antibody against recombinant 85-kDa PLA2. Amersham's ECL detection system was used to detect bound antibody. For analysis of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation the 32P-labeled PLA2 was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the band excised and counted by Cerenkov counting to determine the moles phosphate incorporated per mol of PLA2(16de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Prior to our studies to investigate lysophospholipase activity in stimulated macrophages, experiments were carried out to optimize the lysophospholipase assay of the 85-kDa PLA2. This PLA2 exhibits unusual kinetics characterized by a burst of activity that quickly levels off and ceases after only 5-10% substrate hydrolysis(10Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Leslie C.C. Voelker D.R. Channon J.Y. Wall M.M. Zelarney P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 476-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is observed for both the Ca2+-dependent PLA2 activity against PC liposomes and the Ca2+-independent lysophospholipase activity against lysophospholipid micelles(10Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is thought to be due to trapping of the enzyme on substrate vesicles as product accumulates(24Ghomashchi F. Schuttel S. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3814-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The presence of BSA in the PLA2 assay can partially reverse this phenomenon and helps linearize the reaction curve(24Ghomashchi F. Schuttel S. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3814-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, BSA was found to inhibit the lysophospholipase activity of the 85-kDa enzyme in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). BSA at 0.1 and 1 mg/ml inhibited lysophospholipase activity of the recombinant PLA2 by 50 and 90%, respectively, when assayed in the absence of Ca2+ using a substrate concentration of 50 μM. When 5 mM Ca2+ was included in the assay, inhibition by BSA could be prevented and the degree of reversal was dependent on the BSA concentration. Ca2+ could completely reverse inhibition at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml BSA and lower, but only partially reversed inhibition at concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mg/ml BSA. Ca2+ itself had no significant effect on lysophospholipase activity when assays were run in the absence of BSA, as reported previously(10Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11366-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L. Louis A.I. Kramer R.M. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16de Carvalho M.S. McCormack F.X. Leslie C.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Inhibition by BSA was not unique to the lysophospholipase activity in the cytosolic fraction of Sf9 cells, as BSA at 0.5 and 1 mg/ml also inhibited lysophospholipase activity of purified recombinant PLA2 by 57 and 87%, respectively (data not shown). Although the BSA used was fatty acid-free, experiments were carried out to determine if other lipids bound to the BSA were interfering with the assay. BSA was delipidated using di-isopropyl ether and butanol which removed 75% of the contaminating lipid phosphorus(25Cham B.E. Knowles B.R. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extracted BSA inhibited lysophospholipase activity similarly when compared with equivalent amounts of the unextracted BSA, demonstrating that inhibition was not due to the presence of contaminating lipids. It is well established that albumin has the capacity to bind lysophospholipid and acts as a carrier of this lipid in the blood(26Switzer S. Eder H.A. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 506-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that BSA was binding to the lysophospholipid substrate and interfering with the lysophospholipase assay, the enzyme was assayed in the presence of increasing amounts of lysophospholipid at a fixed concentration of BSA (0.5 mg/ml) in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2). As the substrate concentration was increased from 50 to 200 μM, the degree of inhibition by BSA decreased from 68 to 24%, indicating that inhibition by BSA was dependent on the substrate concentration and suggested that BSA was interacting with the substrate. During stimulation of macrophages with zymosan, phosphorylation of the 85-kDa PLA2 occurs, resulting in a stable increase in PLA2 activity in macrophage cytosols(14Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out to determine if zymosan stimulation resulted in an increase in lysophospholipase activity in the cytosol, which could be attributed to the 85-kDa PLA2. When activity was assayed using 200 μM lysophospholipid, significant Ca2+-independent lysophospholipase activity was observed which was increased by 2-fold in cytosols from zymosan-stimulated cells (Fig. 3). At assay times of 1-2 min, lysophospholipase activity was increased by approximately 50% by the addition of Ca2+. However, as shown in Table 1, lysophospholipase activity could not be detected in macrophage cytosols when assayed using a lower substrate concentration (50 μM) unless Ca2+ was present in the assay. The ability to detect Ca2+-independent lysophospholipase activity increased with increasing substrate concentration, and the stimulatory effects of Ca2+ on activity decreased with increasing substrate concentration. These results were similar to the inhibitory effects of BSA we observed on lysophospholipase activity of recombinant PLA2, suggesting that proteins in the macrophage cytosols might be similarly interfering with the lysophospholipase assay at low substrate concentrations, and Ca2+ was reversing the inhibition.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Since mammalian cells contain multiple lysophospholipases, it was necessary to determine that the zymosan-stimulated lysophospholipase activity in macrophage cytosols was due to the 85-kDa enzyme. When a neutralizing polyclonal antibody against the recombinant baculovirus-expressed PLA2 was incubated with purified recombinant PLA2, both PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities of the enzyme were inhibited, although a higher concentration of antiserum was required to inhibit the lysophospholipase activity of the enzyme (Fig. 4). PLA2 activity was completely inhibited at a serum dilution of 1:50, whereas a 1:25 dilution of antiserum was required to inhibit lysophospholipase activity by 82%. The two enzymatic activities share one catalytic domain(12Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23250-23254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the purified substrates for the two different enzymatic activities assays differ structurally and presumably in how they bind to the enzyme. Thus the differential potency of the antiserum against the two enzymatic activities could possibly be attributed to differences in the inhibition of the binding of the substrates to the enzyme. When tested on macrophage cytosols, preimmune serum did not inhibit activity, whereas immune serum inhibited PLA2 and lysophospholipase activity in both unstimulated and zymosan-stimulated cytosols, verifying that these activities were due to the 85-kDa PLA2 (Fig. 5). Lysophospholipase activity was similarly inhibited whether assayed in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (data not shown).Figure 5:Inhibition of PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities in macrophage cytosols by polyclonal antiserum to the 85-kDa PLA2. Macrophage cytosol from unstimulated (open bars) and zymosan-stimulated (striped bars) cells was incubated with a 1:50 dilution of preimmune (PI) or immune (I) serum from rabbits immunized with recombinant PLA2. Samples were then assayed for lysophospholipase (10 μg of cytosolic protein) (A) or PLA2 activity (20 μg of cytosolic protein) (B). Data are expressed as a percent of the maximum response, which is the activity in zymosan-stimulated cytosol incubated with preimmune serum (100%). The data are from a representative e"
https://openalex.org/W2039640023,"In the Drosophila embryo, the central nervous system (CNS) develops from a population of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) and midline progenitor cells. Here, the fate and extent of determination of CNS progenitors along the dorsoventral axis was assayed. Dorsal neuroectodermal cells transplanted into the ventral neuroectoderm or into the midline produced CNS lineages consistent with their new position. However, ventral neuroectodermal cells and midline cells transplanted to dorsal sites of the neuroectoderm migrated ventrally and produced CNS lineages consistent with their origin. Thus, inductive signals at the ventral midline and adjacent neuroectoderm may confer ventral identities to CNS progenitors as well as the ability to assume and maintain characteristic positions in the developing CNS. Furthermore, ectopic transplantations of wild-type midline cells into single minded (sim) mutant embryos suggest that the ventral midline is required for correct positioning of the cells."

Mutations to Trp, Ala, and Leu have been identified, all of which confer high levels of quinolone resistance. Extensive segments of DNA gyrase are homologous to eukaryotic topoisomerase II, and Ser741 of yeast TOP2 is homologous to Ser83 of prokaryotic DNA gyrA. Introduction of the Ser741→ Trp mutation into yeast TOP2 confers resistance to 6,8-difluoro-7-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-1-cyclopropyl-4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid (CP-115,953), a fluoroquinolone with substantial activity against eukaryotic topoisomerase II, whereas changing Ser741 to either Leu or Ala does not change sensitivity to quinolones. Interestingly, Ser741→ Trp in the yeast TOP2 also confers hypersensitivity to etoposide. Sensitivity to intercalating anti-topoisomerase II agents such as amsacrine is not changed by any of the three mutations. The topoisomerase II protein carrying the Ser741→ Trp mutation was overexpressed and purified. The purified mutant enzyme had enhanced levels of etoposide stabilized covalent complex as compared with the wild type enzyme and reduced cleavage with CP-115,953. Unlike the wild type enzyme, etoposide-stabilized cleavage is not readily reversible by heat. We suggest that Ser741 is near a binding site for both quinolones and etoposide and that the Ser741→ Trp mutation leads to a more stable ternary complex between etoposide, DNA, and the mutant enzyme.

INTRODUCTIONDNA topoisomerases play essential roles in a wide range of DNA metabolic processes(1Cozzarelli N.C. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Studies in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have demonstrated their importance in transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation(2Wang J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The type II topoisomerases, which make transient double strand breaks and change the linking number of DNA in steps of two, play key roles in chromosome structure. In eukaryotic cells, these enzymes are essential for the chromosome condensation/decondensation process critical for the normal progression through mitosis(3Holm C. Goto T. Wang J.C. Botstein D. Cell. 1985; 41: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 4Uemura T. Ohkura H. Adachi Y. Morino K. Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1987; 50: 917-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The ability of the enzyme to pass two DNA strands and change linking number in steps of two uniquely allows this class of enzyme to segregate fully replicated DNA molecules prior to cell division (reviewed in (5Nitiss J.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 103-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and (6Holm C.

Genetic studies in yeast demonstrated that topoisomerase II is the primary physiological target for quinolone cytotoxicity(15Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13150-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike etoposide, which stabilizes cleavage mainly by inhibiting the religation reaction of topoisomerase II, CP-115,953 stabilizes cleavage by enhancing the forward rate of cleavage(12Robinson M.J. Martin B.A. Gootz T.D. McGuirk P.R. Moynihan M. Sutcliffe J.A. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14585-14592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, fluoroquinolones are nonintercalating anti-topoisomerase II agents with a different biochemical mechanism of action than etoposide. Although the action of quinolone-based drugs differs from agents such as etoposide, the ultimate mechanism of cell-killing, enhanced levels of the covalent complex is the same(15Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13150-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Osheroff N. Corbett A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).In Escherichia coli, mutations that lead to quinolone resistance are most often found in gyrA, the structural gene for the DNA gyrase A subunit, although changes that lead to quinolone resistance have also been found in the gyrB subunit. Ser83 of gyrA is the amino acid most frequently mutated in strains with high levels of quinolone resistance(17Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Among the substitutions noted in quinolone-resistant mutants are mutations of Ser83 to Ala, Leu, or Trp, with higher levels of resistance in strains carrying Ser83→ Trp or Ser83→ Leu mutations. It has recently been reported that gyrase protein with the Ser83→ Trp mutation in gyrA has greatly reduced binding of ciprofloxacin compared with the wild type protein, further demonstrating the importance of this region of the protein(18Willmott C.J. Maxwell A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 126-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).These findings have led us to examine the effects of mutations in the yeast TOP2 gene that change Ser741, the amino acid that is homologous to Ser83 in gyrA of E. coli, on the yeast type II enzyme for sensitivity to quinolones as well as other topoisomerase II inhibitors. We have found that the Ser741→ Trp mutation results in resistance to quinolones that act against eukaryotic topoisomerase II. In addition, this mutation causes hypersensitivity to etoposide. Overexpression, purification, and characterization of yeast topoisomerase II carrying the Ser741→ Trp demonstrated that the protein is relatively insensitive to fluoroquinolones and is hypersensitive to etoposide. Our results demonstrate that Ser741 of yeast TOP2 plays a critical role in the action of some anti-topoisomerase II agents and may be directly involved in the interactions of the eukaryotic enzyme with etoposide.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast StrainsThe yeast strains used to examine drug sensitivity were all derived from JN362a (a ura3-52 leu2 trp1 his7 ade1-2 ISE2). Isogenic derivatives of JN362a carrying TOP2 mutations were constructed as described previously(19Liu X.-Y. Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Yeh Y. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2943-2951PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the strain was transformed with Asp718-digested pMJ2 carrying mutations constructed by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis, and the transformants were selected on SC-URA medium(20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar). pMJ2 carries the 3′ portion of the yeast TOP2 gene (4.1-kilobase BglII/BglII fragment) in a yeast integrating plasmid, which has the yeast URA3 gene as a selectable marker. Strains carrying mutations of Ser741→ Trp, Ser741→ Leu, and Ser741→ Ala were constructed. The strains carrying top2 mutations were then converted to rad52- by one-step gene disruption using pSM20, which carries a LEU2 disruption of the RAD52 gene(21Schild D.B. Konforti B. Perez C. Gish W. Mortimer R.K. Curr. Genet. 1983; 7: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All yeast transformations were carried out using the modified lithium acetate protocol of Schiestl and Gietz(22Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar).PlasmidsThe plasmid pMJ2 has been previously described (19Liu X.-Y. Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Yeh Y. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2943-2951PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations were constructed in pMJ2 using the method of Kunkel et al.(23Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar) with the Muta-Gene kit (Bio-Rad) following the supplier's instructions. E. coli strain DH5α was used for propagation of plasmids. The mutations at Ser741 of the yeast TOP2 gene were constructed in pMJ2 using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: GGTGAGCAGTGGTTGGCACAA for Ser741→ Trp, GGTGAGCAGGCGTTGGCACAA for Ser741 [arrow] Ala, and GGTGAGCAGCTGTTGGCACAA for Ser741→ Leu. The bold letters indicate the changes from the wild type yeast TOP2 sequence(24Giaever G. Lynn R. Goto T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12448-12454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.In order to construct a plasmid for overexpressing the Ser741→ Trp mutant topoisomerase II, plasmid pMJ2-S∗W and YEpTOP2-PGAL1 (25Worland S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were digested with KpnI and AvrII. The 2.2-kilobase fragment from pMJ2-S∗W and the 11.5-kilobase fragment from YEpTOP2-PGAL1 were gel purified, ligated, and transformed into E. coli DH5α competent cells. Plasmids that had an identical restriction pattern to YEpTOP2-PGAL1 were identified, and the presence of the Ser741→ Trp mutation in YEpTOP2-PGAL1 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid carrying the mutation was designated YEptop2-S∗W-PGAL1.Measurements of Drug Sensitivity in YeastEtoposide was obtained from Sigma, amsacrine was a gift from Dr. Steve Member of Bristol Myer Laboratories, and CP-115,953 was the gift of Drs. P. R. McGuirk and T. D. Gootz of Pfizer Laboratories. Etoposide and amsacrine were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and CP-115,953 was dissolved as a 25 mM solution in 0.1 N NaOH and diluted to a 5 mM stock with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. All drugs were stored at −80°C in dark. Drug sensitivity measurements were carried out as described previously(19Liu X.-Y. Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Yeh Y. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2943-2951PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells growing in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose/adenine (YPDA) medium at were adjusted to 2 × 106 cells/ml. Drugs or drug solvent was added, and aliquots of samples were removed at the indicated times, diluted, and plated to YPDA medium solidified with 1.6% agar. The minimum lethal concentrations shown in Table 1were determined by examining drug sensitivity as described above and determining the drug concentration required to reduce viability below 100% (i.e. the number of viable cells at T = 0) at 8 and 24 h. Drug concentrations from 1 to 100 μg/ml (or 1-50 μM for CP-115,953) were examined. We also determined IC50 concentrations by growing the cells to stationary phase in the presence of various drug concentrations and then plating dilutions to YPDA plates. The IC50 is the drug concentration that reduces the number of colonies by 50% compared with cells grown to stationary phase in the absence of drug.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Overexpression and Purification of Yeast Topoisomerase IIWild type yeast TOP2 and Ser741→ Trp proteins were overexpressed using YEpTOP2-PGAL1 or YEptop2-S∗W-PGAL1 using yeast strain JEL1 (26Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and purified to homogeneity by a modification of the procedure of Worland and Wang(25Worland S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The detailed procedure has been described elsewhere(27Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II reactions were carried out as described previously using either supercoiled pBR322 to monitor ATPdependent relaxation or kinetoplast DNA isolated from Crithidia fasiculata to monitor decatenation(19Liu X.-Y. Hsiung Y. Jannatipour M. Yeh Y. Nitiss J.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2943-2951PubMed Google Scholar, 27Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Quantitation of Drug-stabilized CleavageQuantitation of DNA cleavage was determined using a modified version of the K+/SDS method(28Jannatipour M. Liu Y.-X. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18586-18592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate was pUC18 DNA that was end-labeled by filling in the EcoRI-digested plasmid with α-32P-labeled dATP using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I. The specific activity of the labeled DNA was typically 1-3 × 106 cpm/μg of DNA, and 5-10 × 105 cpm were added per reaction. The amount of drug-stabilized cleavage was determined in triplicate for each drug concentration. Each cleavage reaction contained 8 units (80 ng) of topoisomerase II. Independent determination of cleavage with the same batch of labeled substrate showed levels of cleavage with a standard error of no more than 10%.DISCUSSIONAcquired drug resistance by mutation of the drug target likely represents a contributor to the failure of drug treatment for both antibacterial and anti-cancer drugs. This has been clearly demonstrated with quinolone antibiotics, where mutations in the structural genes of bacterial DNA gyrase are frequently observed in quinolone-resistant clinical isolates(7Neu H.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 227-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this report, we have demonstrated that mutations in yeast TOP2 at a position homologous to Ser83 of gyrA gives rise to fluoroquinolone resistance. The same mutation also generates hypersensitivity to another class of drugs, epipodophyllotoxins. Our results suggest that in some contexts, it may be possible to overcome acquired drug resistance due to a mutation in the drug target by use of a different class of drugs that act against the same target.We constructed several changes at Ser741 in the yeast TOP2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have demonstrated that mutation of Ser741→ Trp of yeast topoisomerase II confers hypersensitivity to etoposide and resistance to quinolone CP-115,953 in vivo. In agreement with the in vivo results, the Ser741→ Trp protein has increased drug-stabilized cleavage in response to etoposide and decreased drug stabilized cleavage when treated with the fluoroquinolone CP-115,953. The results of Maxwell and Willmott strongly suggest that Ser83 of gyrA is critical for the binding of quinolones to gyrase(18Willmott C.J. Maxwell A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 126-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the homology between gyrase and eukaryotic topoisomerases (32Lynn R. Giaever G. Goto T. Wang J.C. Science. 1986; 233: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) suggested that the equivalent amino acid would be important, at least for the action of fluoroquinolones that have activity against eukaryotic topoisomerase II. However, the homology between yeast TOP2 and gyrA does not result in a perfect correspondence in sensitivity to fluoroquinolones. Most notably, the Ser741→ Leu mutant is not resistant to CP-115,953, nor is it etoposide-hypersensitive. By contrast, a Ser83→ Leu mutation in gyrA results in almost the same level of quinolone resistance as Ser83→ Trp.Although there are likely to be several ways that alterations in TOP2 lead to a drug-resistant protein, it would seem that there are only a limited number of ways where mutations could generate drug hypersensitivity. Because the Ser741→ Trp protein has essentially wild type activity and because the drug hypersensitivity is specific for epipodophyllotoxins (i.e. sensitivity to intercalating drugs is not affected by the mutant protein), the simplest explanation is that the protein's affinity for epipodophyllotoxins is affected. The increased stability of the etoposide-stabilized covalent complex at 65°C also supports the hypothesis that the drug hypersensitivity is due to a more stable interaction between the mutant TOP2 protein and etoposide. The nature of the covalent interaction is unlikely to be qualitatively different with the Ser741→ Trp protein because the covalent complex formed in the absence of drug or in the presence of CP-115,953 is fully heat-reversible. Because gyrA protein carrying a Ser83→ Trp mutation has reduced fluoroquinolone binding(17Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 18Willmott C.J. Maxwell A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 126-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), Ser83 either is part of a domain of gyrase that binds to quinolones or is fairly close to the quinolone binding site. Our results would suggest that the domain including Ser741 in yeast TOP2 interacts with both fluoroquinolones and epipodophyllotoxins. This result is consistent with recently reported results that suggest that fluoroquinolones and etoposide can compete for binding to topoisomerase II(33Corbett A.H. Hong D. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A simple interpretation is that the two agents share (at least in part) the domain required for drug/protein interactions. Our results suggest that Ser741 may be a key part of that domain. Drug binding assays with eukaryotic topoisomerase II have yet to be reported, however, so we have not been able to directly demonstrate the roles of specific domains in interaction with etoposide or other topoisomerase II agents.It should be possible to design etoposide derivatives that generate covalent complexes that behave like the TOP2 Ser741→ Trp-etoposide-DNA complexes with the wild type protein. Because other agents such as clerocidin have been described that can generate heat stable complexes(34Kawada S. Yamashita Y. Fujii N. Nakano H. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2922-2925PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that such agents have a high enough affinity for topoisomerase II such that at 65°C the covalent complex is still favored. It will be of considerable interest to determine whether agents that form such stable cleavage complexes might result in more effective antibacterial or anti-cancer agents. INTRODUCTIONDNA topoisomerases play essential roles in a wide range of DNA metabolic processes(1Cozzarelli N.C. Wang J.C. DNA Topology and Its Biological Effects. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Studies in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have demonstrated their importance in transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation(2Wang J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The type II topoisomerases, which make transient double strand breaks and change the linking number of DNA in steps of two, play key roles in chromosome structure. In eukaryotic cells, these enzymes are essential for the chromosome condensation/decondensation process critical for the normal progression through mitosis(3Holm C. Goto T. Wang J.C. Botstein D. Cell. 1985; 41: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 4Uemura T. Ohkura H. Adachi Y. Morino K. Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1987; 50: 917-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The ability of the enzyme to pass two DNA strands and change linking number in steps of two uniquely allows this class of enzyme to segregate fully replicated DNA molecules prior to cell division (reviewed in (5Nitiss J.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 103-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and (6Holm C. Cell. 1994; 77: 955-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)).Type II topoisomerases have also been identified as a major target of chemotherapeutic agents that are specifically active against prokaryotic cells (7Neu H.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 227-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or against rapidly proliferating cancer cells (8D'Arpa P. Liu L.F. Biochim. Biophys.

The kinase inserts blocked the ability of TrkC to mediate neurotrophin-3 stimulated c-myc and c-fos transcription and activation of the AP-1 transcriptional complex. In cells expressing full-length TrkC, neurotrophin-3 promoted a sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase; TrkC containing kinase inserts only mediated transient activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. The kinase inserts specifically blocked neurotrophin-3-stimulated autophosphorylation of the phospholipase Cγ binding site on TrkC (tyrosine 789) resulting in a severe reduction in phospholipase Cγ association with TrkC and its tyrosine phosphorylation. Neurotrophin-3-stimulated phosphorylation of the Shc binding site (tyrosine 485) on TrkC, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc itself, was unaffected by the kinase inserts; however, the kinase inserts blocked high affinity Shc association with TrkC. It is proposed that the lack of high affinity binding of Shc and/or phospholipase Cγ to the TrkC kinase insert variants may be responsible for the inability of these variants to bring about a full biological response in fibroblasts."

DNA replication initiates at discrete points in the genome, termed origins of replication. Origin DNA sequences are recognized by specialized origin DNA-binding proteins (OBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: OBPorigin DNA-binding proteinsEBNAEpstein-Barr virus nuclear antigenMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. that serve as assembly sites for the DNA replication machinery and can also mediate the local unwinding of origin DNA (reviewed in Kornberg and Baker(1992)). OBPs have been purified and characterized from many different systems including bacteria, plasmids, phages, viruses of mammalian cells, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The OBPs are distinguished by several features: they form multimeric complexes at their respective origins, they lack sequence homology to other characterized DNA-binding proteins, and they are involved in a network of protein-protein interactions with the other components of the replication machinery (Kornberg and Baker, 1992; Kelman and O'Donnell, 1994; Stillman, 1994). The structural mechanisms by which OBPs bind origin DNA and facilitate the assembly of the replication apparatus are unclear. Some insights will undoubtedly arise from the high resolution structure of an OBP and of an OBP bound to its cognate recognition sequence. As a first step toward this goal, we have crystallized the DNA binding domain of an OBP, the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1). origin DNA-binding proteins Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. EBNA1 binds as a dimer to multiple copies of an 18-base pair palindromic sequence present within the latent origin of replication of the Epstein-Barr virus (Rawlins et al., 1985; Frappier and O'Donnell, 1991; Ambinder et al., 1991). During latent infection of host cells, Epstein-Barr virus episomal genomes replicate autonomously, initiating bidirectional replication from the latent origin once every cellular S phase (Adams, 1987; Yates and Guan, 1991). This replication is absolutely dependent on EBNA1 and presumably also requires the cellular replication apparatus (Yates et al., 1985). The mechanism by which EBNA1 activates replication from the latent origin is not yet clear because this protein does not appear to have any intrinsic enzymatic activities (Frappier and O'Donnell, 1991; Middleton and Sugden, 1992). In addition to its role in DNA replication, EBNA1 has been shown to activate transcription (Reisman and Sugden, 1986; Sugden and Warren, 1989), repress transcription (Sample et al., 1992), and govern the stable segregation of Epstein-Barr virus episomes during cell division (Krysan et al., 1989). Like the DNA replication function of EBNA1, all of these functions require the binding of EBNA1 dimers to its DNA recognition sequence. One approach we have taken to better understand EBNA1 function involves the structural analysis of the protein. To begin with we have focussed on the DNA binding and dimerization region, because this region is central to all known EBNA1 functions. Our strategy for structure solution was to purify and crystallize the DNA binding domain of EBNA1 for analysis by x-ray diffraction. The DNA binding and dimerization region of EBNA1 had been previously mapped to the COOH-terminal third of the protein within amino acids 459-607 (Chen et al., 1993). We chose to refine the borders of the domain by limited proteolytic digestion, re-clone the newly defined DNA binding domain for expression in bacteria, and then purify that domain for crystal trials. Six mutants of EBNA1, all containing the DNA binding/dimerization region, were generated. These are EBNA452-641, EBNA470-607, EBNA470-607, and EBNA470-607, where the subscripts indicate the amino acid coordinates within the protein (see Fig. 1). The coding sequence for each mutant was amplified from the EBNA1 gene in plasmid p205 (Yates et al., 1985) using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) by polymerase chain reaction. The restriction sites NdeI and BamHI were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the polymerase chain reaction product, respectively, and were used to insert the EBNA1 fragments between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the T7 polymerase expression vector, pET15b (Novagen). The proteins were thus expressed as COOH-terminal fusions to an NH2-terminal six-histidine tag and a thrombin protease site. Digestion of each fusion protein with thrombin resulted in the inclusion of four residues (GSHM) at the NH2 terminus of the EBNA1 derivatives. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21(DE3)pLysS) (Studier et al., 1990). The polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to yield amplification products with an NdeI site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end and are as follows (written 5′ to 3′): EBNA452-641: 5′ primer CGTCGACATATGGGTCAGGGTGATGGAGGC and 3′ primer CGTGCAGGATCCTCACTCCTGCCCTTCCTCACC; EBNA470-619: 5′ primer CGTCGACATATGCGCAAAAAAGGAGGGTGG and 3′ primer CGTGCAGGATAATCACTCCGCGGCAGCCCCTTCCAC; EBNA470-619: 5′ primer CCTCCACATATGGGTCAAGGAGGTTCCAAC and 3′ primer CGTGCAGGATAATCACTCCGCGGCAGCCCCTTCCAC; EBNA470-607 5′ primer CGTCGACATATGCGCAAAAAACCACCCTGG and 3′ primer CGTCGAGGATCCTCAAGGCAAATCTACTCCATC; EBNA470-607: 5′ primer CCTCCACATATGGGTCAAGGAGGTTCCAAC and 3′ primer CGTGCAGGATCCTCAAGGCAAATCTACTCCATC; and EBNA470-607: 5′ primer CGTCGACATATGCATCGTGGTCAAGGAGGT and 3′ primer CGTGCAGGATCCTCAAGGCAAATCTACTCCATC. Bacterial cells expressing EBNA452-641 were grown in a fermenter (30 liters) in Terrific broth at 37°C to an absorbance of 0.8 at 595 nm, and EBNA1 expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, followed 30 min later by the addition of 150 μg/ml of rifampicin. 3 h postinduction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 1.0 mM benzamidine, 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0 mM EDTA (1 ml/gram of cells). Cells were frozen at −70°C and then thawed and lysed by sonication. NaCl was added to 350 mM, and after a 30-min incubation on ice, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was then placed in a 75°C water bath (for EBNA452-641) or in a 55°C water bath (for the other mutants) until the temperature of the protein solution reached the temperature of the bath. Heating was followed by a 10-min incubation on ice. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min and then flowed through a 60-ml DE52 column (Whatman) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 350 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The DE52 flow-through was diluted with 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, to a final NaCl concentration of 200 mM and loaded on to a 120-ml heparin-agarose column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM dithiothreitol). After washing the column with four column volumes of buffer A, the protein was eluted with buffer A containing 750 mM NaCl. The protein eluate was dialyzed against buffer B (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 750 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM benzamidine) and loaded onto a 5-ml high pressure liquid chromatography metal-chelating column (Perseptive Biosystems) charged with nickel and equilibrated in buffer B plus 5 mM imidazole. The column was developed with a 20-ml linear gradient of 5-300 mM imidazole in buffer B. The fractions containing >99% pure EBNA1 (as judged by Coomassie staining of 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels) were pooled and digested with thrombin (10 units/mg of protein) at 37°C for 2.5 h in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 2.5 mM CaCl2. After digestion, the protein was diluted to 1 mg/ml with the digestion buffer and then diluted further with buffer A lacking NaCl to a final NaCl concentration of 200 mM. This dilution protocol was necessary to avoid protein aggregation. The protein was loaded onto a 5-ml high pressure liquid chromatography Poros S column (Perseptive Biosystems) at 200 mM NaCl in buffer A eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient from 200 mM to 1 M NaCl in buffer A, concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a Centricon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon), and finally dialyzed into buffer C (1 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 500 mM NaCl). EBNA452-641 EBNA470-619, EBNA470-607, and EBNA470-607 were crystallized using the method of hanging drop vapor diffusion using Linbro multiwell tissue culture plates. Unless otherwise stated, the crystals were grown at room temperature from an initial protein solution of 10 mg/ml, and the hanging drop comprised an equal volume of the protein solution and the solution containing the precipitant. All solutions, including the protein, were filtered through 0.22 μM filters before crystallization. The initial goal of this work was to identify the smallest fragment of EBNA1 that harbored DNA binding activity. To accomplish this, EBNA470-619 was subjected to limited protease digestion. Two slightly smaller, yet active, trypsin-resistant fragments were found; NH2-terminal sequencing revealed that the major peptide began at amino acid 470 with a minor component beginning at amino acid 468. Electrospray mass spectroscopy indicated that the mass difference between EBNA470-619 and the proteolytic products was due only to NH2-terminal truncations. Resistance to trypsin digestion suggested that these EBNA fragments were more tightly folded and therefore good candidates for crystallization. These studies pointed to amino acid 470 or 468 as the approximate NH2-terminal boundary of the DNA binding domain. The COOH-terminal boundary could not be as well defined in these studies due to the lack of suitable protease sites near amino acid 619 and therefore was selected on the basis of previous studies that indicated that the DNA binding/dimerization region extended only to amino acid 607 (Ambinder et al., 1991). We therefore generated and purified the truncation mutants EBNA470-607, EBNA470-607, and EBNA470-607 (Fig. 1). Purification of these derivatives was as described above for EBNA470-619, except, to maintain solubility, the salt concentration was maintained at 750 mM NaCl during the digestion with thrombin and while concentrating to 10 mg/ml in buffer C. EBNA459-470 was concentrated in buffer C containing 1 M NaCl. All of these EBNA1 fragments were shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and methylation protection footprints to bind specifically to the 18-base pair EBNA1 recognition sequence. 2H. Summers, J. A. Barwell, R. A. Pfuetzner, A. M. Edwards, and L. Frappier, submitted for publication. The purified proteins are shown in Fig. 2. Each purified protein was subjected to crystallization trials. To crystallize EBNA452-641, the protein was mixed with an equal volume of 50 mM MES, pH 6.0, and 0.1 M ammonium phosphate and incubated over a reservoir containing the same solution. Hexagonal plates with dimensions 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.02 mm or rectangular rods with dimensions 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.01 mm grew in 1-7 days. Smaller hexagonal plates could also be induced to grow from stearylamine/sphingosine lipid layers on the coverslip (Hemming et al., 1995). We were unable to generate EBNA452-641 crystals that were large enough for x-ray diffraction. Several crystal forms of EBNA470-619 were grown. Hexagonal crystals (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm) grew at room temperature in 4-6 weeks over a reservoir containing 0.5 ml of a solution containing 50 mM MES, pH 6.5, and 0.7-0.9 M NaAc. Another crystal form (0.25 × 0.05 × 0.05-mm rectangular rods) grew over a reservoir of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0-7.5, 7-10% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 500 mM NaCl. Diffraction analysis revealed that these crystal forms were twinned and not ideal for x-ray analysis. Two other crystal forms of EBNA470-619 grew in 4-6 weeks over a reservoir solution containing 50 mM MES, pH 6-6.5, and 0.8-1.0 M sodium formate. Both crystals had a hexagonal morphology and grew to a maximal dimension of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm. Diffraction from these crystals was measured at room temperature on an RAXIS II image plate area detector with CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator. The x-rays were focussed to a 0.2-mm spot with Supper double focussing mirrors. The diffraction from each crystal extended to beyond 2.5 Å resolution. These two crystal forms could only be distinguished by diffraction analysis. The first crystal was trigonal with a unit cell of a = b = 86.7 Å and c = 31.8 Å, and the space group assigned as P312. Only two crystals with this space group were detected and in these instances co-existed in the same drop with another crystal form, which was also trigonal with a very similar unit cell of dimensions (a = b = 86.5 Å and c = 31.8 Å). The space group of the second crystal form was tentatively assigned as P3. In the P3 crystal, the calculated unit-cell volume was 205,106 Å3, and using a protein density of 1.3 g/cm3, one can infer two molecules in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of 39%. A heavy atom derivative of the P3 crystals has been prepared by soaking the crystals in mercury acetate, and the space group assignment was confirmed. A self-rotation function showed several possible positions for the noncrystallographic axis (Fig. 3). Of these possibilities, the most probable position of the noncrystallographic axis is that parallel to the ab plane (as indicated) because the noncrystallographic axis in the P3 crystal is probably near to the crystallographic 2-fold in the very closely related P312 crystal form. A native data set was collected from the P3 crystals, and the statistics are shown in Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Crystals of the EBNA470-607 and EBNA470-607 fragments were grown over a reservoir solution containing 50 mM MES, pH 6.0, and 0-100 mM NaCl. Rectangular rods with dimensions of 0.5-1.0 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm grew at room temperature in 2-3 days. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that these crystals were tetragonal with unit cell dimensions a = 59 Å, b = 66 Å, and c = 69 Å; the space group assignment was P212121. The diffraction extended to beyond 2 Å, and a heavy atom derivative was obtained by soaking in a solution containing para-chloromercurobenzoate. The interpretation of the Patterson maps permitted the location of several heavy atom sites as well as the confirmation of the space group assignment. Similar analysis to that described above for the P3 crystals indicated that there are two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the P212121 crystal and that the solvent content was 45%. A self-rotation function showed several possible directions for the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis (Fig. 4). At present, we have not been able to determine which is the correct location of the NC axis. Native data sets were collected from the P212121 crystals both at room temperature and at −175°C. The low temperature was maintained using a nitrogen gas delivery system from Molecular Structure Corporation. The crystals were cryoprotected by sequential 5-min incubations of the crystal in the mother liquor appended with 5, 10, 15, and 20% glycerol, mounted in a loop made from a strand of dental floss, and then flash frozen in the stream of nitrogen gas. The statistics for both room temperature and frozen data sets are shown in Table 1. To date, DNA binding proteins that activate DNA replication from origin sequences have been recalcitrant to crystallization. For EBNA1, we used a combination of deletion analysis and partial proteolysis to delineate a set of soluble protein fragments that retains the activity of interest and then subjected each to crystallization trials. Each soluble, proteolytically stable domain formed crystals quite readily, attesting to the utility of this approach. However, in our studies, only two of the five EBNA1 fragments that we crystallized yielded crystals suitable for structure determination. These data suggest that stability to protease digestion should be used only as the first approximation of a suitable domain for crystallization and that the most suitable fragment must be identified by testing a set of proteins that contain amino and carboxyl termini that either flank or impinge on the proteolytically defined domain. Diffraction quality crystals will likely be grown from within this set of soluble domains."

Transient transfection assays with a series of deletion IL-5 promoter reporter constructs indicate that multiple regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking region of the IL-5 promoter play a role in regulating IL-5 transcription in Th2 cells. Negatively acting elements, NRE I and NRE II, map to the regions between positions −431 and −392 and positions −300 and −261. A positive regulatory element has been mapped to the region between positions −224 and −81. The activity of these elements is dependent on activation of the cells. A 40-bp sequence within this region, termed the IL-5 PRE, has been shown to bind at least two specific nuclear protein complexes from unstimulated and stimulated D10.G4.1 cells. An additional protein complex specific for this site has been identified in nuclear fractions from cells stimulated in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide.

Ins(1,3,4)P3 (20 μM) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (2 mM) were also potent inhibitors of Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding, but not inositol 4-phosphate or inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (20 μM each). Aldolase-bound Ins(1,4,5)P3 may play a role in phospholipase C-independent increases in free [Ins(1,4,5)P3]. Many reports have demonstrated the importance of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) 1The abbreviations used are: Ins(1,4,5)P3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatePIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePIphosphatidylinositolPIPphosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatePTSMporcine tracheal smooth muscleERendoplasmic reticulumSRsarcoplasmic reticulumFru(1,6)P2fructose 1,6-bisphosphateFru(2,6)P2fructose 2,6-bisphosphateHEDTAN-hydroxyethlethylenediamine triacetic acidGAPD-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphateGAPDHD-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenasePEGpolyethylene glycolI(4)Pinositol 4-phosphateIns(1,4)P2inositol 1,4-bisphosphateIns(1,3,4)P3inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphatealdolase4aldolase tetramer. -evoked Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in various non-muscle cells(1Berridge M.J.

Although a role of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release is established for smooth muscle(3Somlyo A.V. Bond M. Somlyo A.P. Scarpa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S.

Physiol. 1990; 258: L119-L133PubMed Google Scholar), it is not proven that Ins(1,4,5)P3 can be formed rapidly enough from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) during receptor activation to be involved in initial increases in free [Ca2+] which drive force development. This requires that increases in [Ins(1,4,5)P3]free to levels which release SR Ca2+ occur within a few 100 ms of receptor activation of the muscle(5Coburn R.F. Baron C.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: L119-L133PubMed Google Scholar). We did not detect any rapid or sustained increases in total Ins(1,4,5)P3 content in porcine tracheal smooth muscle (PTSM) during muscarinic receptor-evoked force development. However, phospholipase C was activated as determined by measurements of flux in inositol phospholipids and increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 by-products(6Baron C.B. Pring M. Coburn R.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C375-C383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other smooth muscles, transient increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 have been measured for a few seconds following receptor activation(7Gu H.

In a vascular smooth muscle, large stretch-activated increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 content occur within 200-300 ms after stretch to Lmax(10Matsumoto H. Baron C.B. Coburn R.F. Am. J.

In a previous study(11Baron C.B. Pompeo J.N. Azim S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we obtained evidence that there may be a bound or sequestered Ins(1,4,5)P3 store in PTSM. The Ins(1,4,5)P3 content in resting, unstimulated muscle averaged 2.7 μM (assuming uniform mixing in cellular water), a value much higher than that required to release ER and SR Ca2+ (12Hashimoto T. Hirata M. Ito Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 86: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Joseph S.K. Rice H.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 355-359PubMed Google Scholar). (High values of resting Ins(1,4,5)P3 contents have been reported for other tissues, as well(14Horstman D.A. Takemura H. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Ins(1,4,5)P3 content decreased during atropine-induced relaxation of carbachol-contracted PTSM to levels about 60% of the unstimulated level. This suggests that a portion of the sequestered store is released during the carbachol-stimulated contraction and is not refilled during an atropine-induced relaxation. Ins(1,4,5)P3 can bind to membranes via Ins(1,4,5)P3-receptors (17Supattapone S. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1530-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to cytosolic proteins (18Koppitz B. Vogel F. Mayr G.W. Eur. J.

Ins(1,4,5)P3 can bind to aldolase (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, EC 4.1.2.13) A (skeletal muscle) and B (liver); the substrate for the enzyme, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru(1,6)P2), can reduce the affinity of aldolase A and B for Ins(1,4,5)P3(18Koppitz B.

The total bound Ins(1,4,5)P3 store in brain has not yet been determined, and it is unknown if, in brain cells, metabolic events release bound Ins(1,4,5)P3 which could then exert effects on cellular function. In the present study we developed and studied a cytoskeleton fraction in PTSM. Data were obtained which indicate that aldolase is almost entirely associated with the cytoskeleton in this muscle. We purified aldolase recovered from this fraction and showed that it is aldolase C and that it binds and releases Ins(1,4,5)P3 under conditions which may occur physiologically. Total cellular aldolase content was quantitated and shown to be very large suggesting there is a potential site for binding large amounts of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Porcine tracheal smooth muscle strips were prepared as described previously(22Baba K Baron C.B. Coburn R.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 412: 23-42Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unstimulated strips were incubated in Krebs solution at 37°C for 1 h and then freeze-clamped with liquid N2-cooled tongs. The frozen tissue was ground to a fine powder in a liquid N2-cooled mortar and pestle and stored at −70°C until used. The method described below was adapted from that described by Jones et al.(23Jones L.R. Besch Jr., H.R. Fleming J.W. McConnaughey M.M. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 530-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Caroni and Carafoli (24Caroni P. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3263-3270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Popescu and Ignat(25Popescu L.M. Ignat P. Cell Calcium. 1983; 34: 219-235Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar); this preparation was originally used to prepare muscle sarcolemma. Frozen, powdered tissue was thawed and dispersed by slow addition to 6 ml of homogenization buffer: 20 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.3, 250 mM sucrose, 2 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM MgCl2 (0.45 mM free), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 μM calpain inhibitor peptide, and 5 μg/ml each of aproptinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. All steps in this preparation were performed at 0°C. The suspension was homogenized in a 7-ml Tenbroeck homogenizer (Wheaton, Wheaton, NJ) and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g. The supernatant was collected, the pellet resuspended in homogenization buffer and the above procedure repeated five more times. The pooled supernatant from multiple washes was centrifuged two times (1,000 × g for 20 min; 100,000 × g for 1 h). The 100,000 × g supernatant is the “cytosolic” fraction. The pellet obtained from the 1,000 × g centrifugation was added to the 200 × g pellet (resulting in a 10% increase in total aldolase activity). This fraction has been termed the “ghost” fraction, so named because of its microscopic appearance(25Popescu L.M. Ignat P. Cell Calcium. 1983; 34: 219-235Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Ghost suspensions were homogenized in 6 ml of release buffer: 20 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.3, and 0.6 M KCl, 2 mM EGTA, and centrifuged for 20 min at 1,000 × g. The pellet was rehomogenized and centrifuged. The resulting pellet is the sarcolemmal fraction studied previously (24Caroni P. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3263-3270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Popescu L.M. Ignat P. Cell Calcium. 1983; 34: 219-235Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) but not used extensively in the present study. Pooled supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to removal all membrane particles and then dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM HEDTA (standard buffer). Following dialysis and reduction of the ionic strength, the solution became cloudy and was clarified by centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 × g) which removed proteins consisting mainly of myosin and actin. The supernatant is the “K-released” fraction used in this study. K-released proteins were applied to a DE32 (microgranular DEAE-cellulose (Whatman, Clifton, NJ), 5 ml bed volume, and eluted with standard buffer. Aldolase-containing fractions of the DEAE wash-through were applied to a 1-ml column of no. 204 resin (26Hirata K M Watanabe Y. Ishimatsu T. Yanaga F. Koga T. Ozaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (2-O-[4-(5-aminoethyl-2-hydroxyphenylazo) benzoyl]-1,4,5-tri-O-phosphono-myo-inositol-Sepharose 4B) (Ins(1,4,5)P3 affinity column). This column was washed with 24 ml of 10 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.3, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 mM NaN3 (buffer A) and then with buffer A containing the indicated [NaCl]: 26 ml of 0.15 M, 30 ml gradient of 0.15-0.65 M and 8 ml of 2 M. Aldolase was assayed by coupling the reaction to the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) to 1,3-diphosphoglyceric acid by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and following the reduction of NAD (2 mol/mol Fru(1,6)P2 hydrolyzed) at 340 nm. The assay was modified by using arsenate (27Hardin C.D. Paul R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) instead of phosphate as the product, 1-phospho-3-arsenoglyceric acid, spontaneously hydrolyzes. Thus, there is no need for additional enzymes to remove products. Early assays were performed at pH 7.6; the reaction mixture contained 200 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM Na2AsO4, 1 mM Fru(1,6)P2, and 1 unit of rabbit skeletal muscle GAPDH in 1 ml (addition of triose phosphate isomerase did not increase the rate and so was not included). Later experiments contained 100 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM Na2AsO4, 1 unit of GAPDH, and 2.5-80 μM Fru(1,6)P2. When aldolase was assayed at different pH values, 0.1 M HEPES-Tris (i.e. [HEPES] + [Tris] = 0.1 M) was used instead of triethanolamine. Mixtures were incubated at 37°C, and base-line NADH formation was determined. The reaction was started by addition of enzyme. 1 unit of aldolase was taken to equal to 1 μmol of Fru(1,6)P2 hydrolyzed/min at 37°C. This was determined using antibodies to aldolase A, B, and C, and by determining preferential substrates (Fru(1,6)P2versus Fru(1)P) for PTSM aldolase(28Penhoet E.E. Rajkumar T. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1966; 56: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We used two different assays: protein precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and equilibrium dialysis. The PEG assay was adapted from the method of Kanematsu et al.(19Kanematsu T. Takeya H. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Yoshida M. Koga T. Iwanaga S. Mirata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6518-6525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and utilized 50 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 0.6 mg/ml γ-globulins, and 3 nM [3H]-Ins(1,4,5)P3 in a volume of 50 μl. Assays were performed at 0°C. The sample was added and the mixture incubated for 20 min. 50 μl of 30% PEG (average Mr 8,000) was added, vortexed, and left on ice for an additional 20 min. The mixture was centrifuged two times (first horizontally at 15,000 × g for 15 min with about 95% of the supernatant removed and second in an angled rotor at 15,000 × g for 5 min with the remaining supernatant removed). The pellet was dissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.1 N NaOH, transferred to a counting vial, and the tube rinsed with 0.4 ml of H2O which was added to the vial. Vials were counted in a scintillation counter. An aliquot of the mixture was taken prior to the addition of sample to determine the [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 radioactivity in the assay. PEG did not completely precipitate aldolase, as determined by measuring aldolase activity in the pellet (obtained by dissolving the pellet in 20 mM HEPES-Na, pH 7.3); this factor (0.753 ± 0.009) was used to correct for the amount of aldolase in the PEG precipitation assay. Specific binding was determined by the addition of unlabeled Ins(1,4,5)P3. Complete displacement of radioactivity was achieved with 200 μM unlabeled Ins(1,4,5)P3 and was the same value as γ-globulin alone (with or without 200 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3). When binding was assayed at different pH values, the same HEPES-Tris buffers were used as described in the aldolase activity assay. The equilibrium dialysis assay conditions were the same as in the PEG assay except that aldolase and [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 were added on opposite sides; aliquots of each side were counted after 3 days of equilibration at 4°C. Binding of these compounds was assessed indirectly by determining if they displaced bound Ins(1,4,5)P3. The computer program MAXC, v6.50 (29Patton C. MAX CHELATOR v 6.50. Stanford University, Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, CA1993Google Scholar) was used. Proteins were dialyzed against water, SDS and dithiothreitol added to 1.1% and 20 mM, respectively, placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and 10% glycerol added. Electrophoresis was carried out in 0.4 M Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, in an 8% acrylamide running gel with a 4% acrylamide stacking gel at 45 milliamps/gel (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed and stained with 0.05% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R in methanol/water/acetic acid (20:73:7, by volume). When gels were silver stained(31Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar), they were first destained in methanol/water/acetic acid and then rinsed with water to remove all methanol and acetic acid. Densitometric traces (Shimadzu CS-930) of the gels were performed at 555 nm for Coomassie Brilliant Blue R and at 474 nm for silver. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously(32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Densitometric traces (Shimadzu CS-930) of the blots were performed at 552 nm. Protein was measured using the Micro BCA Protein Reagent Kit (Pierce) (prior precipitation with 7% trichloroacetic acid was used to remove interfering substances). We measured total phospholipid Pi by the method of Ames(33Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). 5′-Nucleotidase activity was measured by incubating aliquots of tissue extracts with 5 mM AMP, 5 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, the samples centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g, and the supernatants analyzed for released phosphate. Phosphate detected with 0.41% (NH4)6Mo7O24•4H2O, 0.375 M H2SO4, and 1.1% FeSO4 at 660 nm. Constants and standard deviations were obtained by using non-linear curve fitting with the computer program SYSTAT (ver. 3.0). Sigmoidal curves were fitted to the general equation y = (a-c)/(1 + (x/k)b) + c(34De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 was purchased from DuPont NEN. Non-radioactive Ins(1,4,5)P3 was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO. HEPES, polyethylene glycol, rabbit skeletal muscle aldolase A, γ-globulins, EGTA, EDTA, HEDTA, rabbit skeletal muscle GAPDH, DL-GAP, NAD, arsenic acid (disodium salt), Fru(1,6)P2, Fru(2,6)P2, calpain inhibitor peptide, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antibodies to vinculin, talin, and α-actinin were from Sigma. Octyl glucoside (OG) was from Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA. Triton X-100 was from Rohm and Haas, Philadelphia, PA. Antibodies to human aldolase A-C were kindly provided by Dr. Kanefusa Kato, Aichi Prefectural Colony, Japan. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Gels prepared using SDS-solubilized ghosts (Fig. 1) showed that the major solubilized proteins are actin and myosin. Ghost suspensions contained about 50% of total cellular phospholipid and 80% of 5′-nucleotidase activity. About 21% of ghost proteins could be released from ghosts with 0.6 M KCl. After removal of particulate material by a 100,000 × g centrifugation for 1 h, 16% of cellular proteins remained in the supernatant (the K-released preparation used in this study). The K-released fraction contained 11 and 17% of total cellular myosin and actin, respectively, as assessed by areas of peaks in gels. K-released proteins reacted strongly with antibodies to vinculin, talin, and α-actinin (Fig. 2). No phospholipid or 5′-nucleotidase activity was detected in the K-released fraction. Table 1summarizes data relevant to various components and properties of ghosts and K-released proteins. We have concluded from the above data that ghosts consist of extracellular matrix-sarcolemma-cytoskeleton complexes and that KCl-released protein fractions contain cytoskeleton proteins and no plasma membrane. The absence of lipid in this preparation suggests the absence of intact organelles, i.e. intact ER, SR, and nucleus. Small amounts of myosin are still present in this preparation. Although this could reflect myosin in the cytoskeleton, i.e. myosin motors, it is possible that some contractile proteins are still attached to the cytoskeleton.Figure 2:Western blots. A, study of K-released proteins using to antibodies to vinculin, α-actinin, and talin. B, identity of aldolase isoforms. Lanes 1-3 contained K-released proteins (15 μg), and lane 4 contained 0.75 μg of purified PTSM aldolase. Antibodies to aldolase A-C were applied as shown in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab 93% of cellular aldolase activity was recovered in ghost suspensions from either unstimulated or 55 μM carbachol-stimulated (20 s or 5 min) tissue and could be entirely released by treatment with high tonicity (0.6 M KCl) into the K-released fraction. The remainder of aldolase activity was recovered mainly in the cytoplasm. No activity was detectable in the sarcolemma. Since it is possible that high tonicity could break bonds between aldolase and plasma membrane components, we solubilized ghosts using the detergents Triton X-100 (0.5%) or octyl glucoside (30 mM). This treatment did not release aldolase activity into the supernatant nor change release of aldolase evoked by a subsequent increase in KCl. We concluded that particulate aldolase was released from the cytoskeleton during 0.6 M KCl wash of ghosts and not from the plasma membrane. These data were similar to those reported in other tissues (27Hardin C.D. Paul R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 35Mathur R.L. Reddy M.C. Yee S. Imbesi R. Groth-Vasselli B. Farnsworth P.N. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Assay of aldolase activity in K-released proteins was entirely dependent on the presence of added GAPDH. However, with ghosts aldolase activity in the entire absence of added GAPDH was as large as 60% of that in the presence of added GAPDH. This indicates that endogenous GAPDH and aldolase are associated with the intact ghosts. K-released proteins were passed through a DEAE column. Aldolase activity, and coincident Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding, did not stick to the DEAE column, but passed through the column in the washes. These fractions were then passed through an Ins(1,4,5)P3 affinity column. This revealed (Fig. 3) one major peak of aldolase activity (>80% of total aldolase activity) which was eluted between 0.2-0.4 M NaCl. Ins(1,4,5)P3, up to 10 μM, did not elute any aldolase or Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding protein. GAPDH activity (an enzyme which can contaminate aldolase preparations as observed in other tissues) was not detected. SDS-gel electrophoresis of aldolase recovered from the affinity column contained only one major peak, at 35-40 kDa (Fig. 4). SDS-gel electrophoresis of rabbit skeletal muscle aldolase A showed a peak at an identical molecular weight as PTSM aldolase (not shown).Figure 4:SDS-gel electrophoresis of purified PTSM aldolase and Western blot against anti aldolase C antibody. Densitometric tracings (aligned at the front) of silver-stained aldolase (solid line) (1 μg) following SDS-PAGE and a Western blot run against anti-aldolase C (dotted line; blot is shown Fig. 2B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The upper × axis was determined from the molecular weights of standard proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An estimate of the molecular weight of native aldolase was obtained by Sephacryl S-300 HR chromatography of K-released proteins in standard buffer containing 0.6 M KCl. Aldolase activity and Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding were coincident at a molecular mass of 138 kDa. Table 2shows that aldolase was purified from K-released proteins with only an 11-fold purification. Note that the use of K-released proteins already resulted in a 17-fold purification of aldolase, given as activity/total cellular protein. Therefore, the total purification to apparent homogeneity was about 190-fold. Thus, aldolase contributes about 9% of the total K-released proteins and about 0.5% of total cellular protein.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The total aldolase content in the tissue was computed by measurement of aldolase activity in the entire crude fraction and the specific activity of purified smooth muscle aldolase. This assumes aldolase specific activity is constant throughout the tissue and is the same as the specific activity of purified aldolase. This calculation is given under “Appendix.” Total aldolase content was computed to be 0.52 μg/mg cellular protein. The total content of the aldolase tetramer (aldolase4) given per 100 nmol phospholipid Pi was 34.5 pmol/100 nmol lipid Pi. Aldolase in the K-released fraction and purified aldolase reacted strongly with anti-aldolase C antibody, but not with anti-aldolase A or B antibodies (Fig. 2). PTSM aldolase activity was 29 ± 3 times greater with Fru(1,6)P2 as substrate than when Fru(1)P was used. This finding supports the conclusion that aldolase C is the major aldolase isoform in PTSM(28Penhoet E.E. Rajkumar T. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1966; 56: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In rabbit tissue, aldolase A (skeletal muscle) and B (liver) ratios of activity with Fru(1,6)P2/Fru(1)P were reported to be 55, and 1.2, respectively(28Penhoet E.E. Rajkumar T. Rutter W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1966; 56: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The apparent Km for Fru(1,6)P2 (range 2.5-75 μM; 37°C, [Ca2+] = 0, pH 7.0) was 18.5 ± 2.0 μM. The addition of 10 μM Ins(1,4,5)P3 had no effect on purified aldolase activity either at [Fru(1,6)P2] of 2.5 or 25 μM (however, a higher [Ins(1,4,5)P3] (20 μM) caused a small (30.1 ± 4.7%), significant inhibition (p < 0.002)). Fig. 5shows the effects of altering pH on purified aldolase activity. These data were obtained using [Fru(1,6)P2] 1 mM and standard conditions quoted above (i.e. [Ca2+] = 0). Maximal activity was recorded at pH 8.0. The low Fru(1,6)P2 hydrolytic activity observed at pH 6.0 was not due to a reduced activity of the added GAPDH used in the coupled enzymatic assay. This was verified by increasing the amount of GAPDH by 10-fold. Data were obtained over the range [Ins(1,4,5)P3] 3 nM to 20 μM (Fig. 6). These data show concentration-dependent binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to aldolase and that there was no difference with the two different methods of determining Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding. We were not able to saturate Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to aldolase at 20 μM free Ins(1,4,5)P3. At this concentration binding reached about 0.6 mol of Ins(1,4,5)P3 bound/mol of aldolase4. The Kd for binding and the total capacity of aldolase to bind Ins(1,4,5)P3 were computed using the dissociation equation for the reaction: Aldolase4(Ins(1,4,5)P3)n↔aldolase4+nIns(1,4,5)P3Kd=[A]f[I]fn/[AIn](Eq. 1) where Kd = dissociation constant, [A]f = the free concentration of aldolase4, [I]f = the free concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3, [AIn] = the concentration of aldolase-Ins(1,4,5)P3 complex, n = the number of Ins(1,4,5)P3 bound/aldolase4, [A]t = the total concentration of aldolase4 and thus, n[AIn]/[A]t = the total amount of Ins(1,4,5)P3 bound/total aldolase4 (mol/mol). Using [A]t = [A]f + [AIn], the equation was transposed to n[AIn]/[A]t = n[I]fn/(Kd +[I]fn). The values obtained from the mathematical fitting (Fig. 6) of n[AIn]/[A]t versus"

https://openalex.org/W2170431338,"Chemical cross-linking was used to analyze the binding sites for the agonist bradykinin (BK) and the antagonists NPC17731 and HOE140 on the bovine B2 bradykinin receptor. [3H]BK and [3H]NPC17731 bound with high affinity to the same B2 receptor in bovine myometrial membranes as determined by the total number of specific binding sites and pharmacological specificity of the binding of these two radioligands. Cross-linking experiments were done using a series of bifunctional reagents reactive either primarily to amines (homobifunctional) or reactive to amines in one end and to sulfhydryls in the opposite end (heterobifunctional). All the heterobifunctional reagents plus the homobifunctional arylhalide 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene were effective in cross-linking the [3H]BK N terminus specifically to a sulfhydryl in the receptor, and this cross-linking occurred at 5-100 μM reagent. In contrast, the homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester reagents, at ≤1 mM, were only able to cross-link [3H]BK to membrane proteins nonspecifically. The sulfhydryl reagents N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, and phenylarsine oxide blocked cross-linking, whereas these reagents did not inhibit reversible specific [3H]BK binding. Immunoblotting with anti-BK antiserum revealed that low concentrations of BK (5-50 nM) were cross-linked to a receptor-specific species of 65 kDa. All cross-linking of [3H]NPC17731 was nonspecific with both homobifunctional and heterobifunctional reagents. The 65-kDa receptor-specific species was observed on anti-HOE140 immunoblots, but only when proteins were cross-linked with very high concentrations of HOE140 (≥500 nM).

(Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg) belongs to the kinin family of vasoactive peptides which have dramatic biological activities on a number of different tissues and organs including smooth muscle contraction and relaxation, increased vascular permeability, pain, and cell proliferation(1Regoli D.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). These advances have opened new avenues for identification of specific domains and residues crucial for ligand binding and function of these receptors.BK antagonists have been synthesized. The first generation of antagonists were developed around the crucial replacement of L-Pro7 in BK with a D-aromatic amino acid residue resulting in moderately high affinities for the B2 receptor(28Vavrek R.J. Stewart J.M. Peptides. 1985; 6: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 29Stewart J.M. Vavrek R.J. Burch R.M. Bradykinin Antagonists: Basic and Clinical Research. Marcel Dekker, New York1991: 51-96Google Scholar). D-Arg0-(Hyp3, D-Phe7)-BK (NPC567) is a typical example of this generation. In second generation antagonists, a restricted β-turn was introduced in the C-terminal portion of the peptide, and this modification substantially increased affinities of these antagonists for the receptor(30Kyle D.J.

D-Arg0-(Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8)-BK (HOE140), where Tic is D-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-yl-carbonyl and Oic is L-[(3aS,7aS)-octahydroindol-2-yl-carbonyl], and D-Arg0-(Hyp3, D-Hype (trans-propyl)7, Oic8)-BK (NPC17731) are typical examples of this generation.Previously, we presented a three-state model of agonist binding to the B2 receptor(35Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this model was subsequently shown to accommodate negative antagonistic/inverse agonistic activity of a number of first and second generation BK antagonists(36Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. Herzig M.C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25970-25973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The classification of at least some BK antagonists as inverse agonists, and, consequently, as having intrinsic functional activity on their own, has increased the importance of delineating the binding sites for B2 receptor agonists and antagonists. Chemical cross-linking has been used extensively to covalently attach ligands to receptors. In this study, we used this technique to investigate the relationship between the binding sites for these two classes of ligands in the B2 receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[2,3-prolyl-3,4-3H]Bradykinin (110 Ci/mmol) and [prolyl-3,4-3H]NPC17731 (53.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Fresh uteri from pregnant cows were from a local slaughterhouse. HOE140 and NPC567 were from Bachem, Inc. (Torrance, CA), while NPC17731 was the kind gift of Dr. S. Farmer of Zeneca Pharmaceuticals Group (Wilmington, DE). BK was purchased from Sigma. Gpp(NH)p was from Boehringer Mannheim. The cross-linkers MBS, SMPB, SMCC, SPDP, DSS, DSP, DST, and DFDNB were from Pierce. Polyclonal anti-BK antiserum was from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA), while monoclonal anti-HOE140 antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. W. Muller-Esterl of the University of Mainz (Mainz, Germany). All other biochemicals were of the highest grade available.Membrane PreparationMembranes were prepared essentially by a procedure originally described by Fredrick et al.(37Fredrick M.J. Vavrek R.J. Stewart J.M. Odya C.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1984; 33: 2887-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and subsequently by Leeb-Lundberg and Mathis (35Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications. After excision, the uteri were immersed in ice. The myometrium was dissected free of the endometrium and other extraneous tissue fragments, chopped in a commercial meat grinder, and then homogenized in ice-cold buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.7, 115 mM NaCl, 4.6 mM KCl, 22 mM NaHCO3, 0.9 mM MgSO4-7H20, 5.5 mM glucose, 13.4 mM Na2EDTA; 1:2 w/v) in a Waring Commercial CB-6 blender for 4 min (medium speed) at 4°C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,600 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellets were recovered, frozen in liquid N2, and stored for up to 2 months before further processing. Upon thawing, the pellets were homogenized again in buffer (1:4, v/v) as described above and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was decanted through cheesecloth and then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. The membrane pellet was frozen in liquid N2, thawed, and washed once by homogenization in 25 mM TES, pH 6.8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM 1,10 phenanthroline, then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The washed membranes were stored in the same buffer in aliquots of 15-25 mg of protein/ml at −80°C until use.Membrane SolubilizationAliquots of frozen membranes were thawed, diluted 2.5-fold with ice-cold solubilization buffer (25 mM TES, pH 7.2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, 140 μg/ml bacitracin), then solubilized as described previously(38Mathis S.A. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Radioligand BindingRadioligand binding assays were done essentially as described previously(35Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane preparations were thawed and diluted to 50-500 μg of protein/ml in binding buffer (25 mM TES, pH 7.2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, 140 μg/ml bacitracin). Binding assays were initiated by addition of radioligand (50 μl) with and without excess nonradiolabeled ligand to the receptor preparation (450 μl). In assays following pretreatment with sulfhydryl reagents, the preparation (225 μl) was incubated with reagent (25 μl) as described in the figure legends prior to addition of ligand (250 μl). After incubation for 60-90 min at 24°C, assays were terminated by dilution with 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and rapid vacuum filtration on Whatman GF/C filters previously soaked in 1% polyethyleneimine. The trapped membranes were then washed with an additional 2 × 4 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Filters were counted for tritium in a Beckman LS50000TD scintillation counter.Protein Cross-linkingAliquots of membrane or solubilized preparations were allowed to bind ligand for 60-90 min at 24°C as described above before addition of Me2SO (2% maximum final concentration) with and without cross-linking reagent; the incubation with cross-linker was continued for an additional 10 min. The cross-linking reaction was then quenched by a 1:1 dilution with 2 M glycine in binding buffer (quench buffer). In the case of solubilized preparations, the quench buffer included also the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 μM), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml). In order to dissociate noncovalently bound radioligand, quenched samples were diluted 4-fold with buffer containing 1 μM BK and 10 μM Gpp(NH)p and incubated for 60-120 min at 24°C followed by filtration on GF/C filters as described above. Cross-linked ligand was the amount of radioligand remaining after dissociation. Specific cross-linked ligand was cross-linked radioligand minus nonspecific binding (as determined in the presence of 1 μM BK in the binding assay). Cross-linking efficiency was the specific cross-linking as percent of total specific binding.ImmunoblottingCross-linked solubilized preparations were concentrated to 30 μl on Centricon 30 filters (Amicon) at 4°C. Samples of preparations were heated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel elecrophoresis buffer for 3 min at 100°C. Following electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, the fractionated proteins were electroblotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) at ~500 mA for 45 min at 4°C using a Genie electroblotter (Idea Scientific) as described by Towbin et al.(39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked by incubation in 10% defatted milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated with anti-BK antiserum (1:4) or anti-HOE140 antiserum (1:1000) at 24°C overnight. The nitrocellulose membranes were washed by a brief rinse in TBS followed by three separate 5-min washes in TBS containing 0.02% Nonidet P-40 followed by a final rinse in TBS. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with ECL (Amersham Corp.) using peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody according to procedures described by the supplier.Other AssaysProteins were assayed using the method of Laemmli(40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar).

Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the physical relationship between the agonist and antagonist binding sites on this receptor, we used a series of commercially available homo- and heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents of various lengths and reactivities(41Wold F. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 623-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 42Ji J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 580-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All of the reagents used, except DFDNB (3Å), contain at least one N-hydroxysuccinimide ester which reacts preferentially with primary amines. The arylhalides of DFDNB exhibit a similar amine reactivity(41Wold F. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 623-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 42Ji J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 580-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The homobifunctional reagents DSS (11.4Å), DST (6.8Å), and DSP (12Å) contain an additional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester at the opposite end of the molecule, whereas the heterobifunctional reagents contain either a maleimide (MBS (9.9Å), SMPB (14.5Å), SMCC (11.6Å)) or a pyridyldisulfide (SPDP (6.8Å)), both of which react preferentially with sulfhydryls. Hence, while all of the reagents were capable of reacting with the N terminus of BK, the former reagents were also capable of reacting with membrane primary amines while the latter reagents were capable of reacting with membrane sulfhydryls.The effectiveness of the cross-linkers was assessed in [3H]BK binding experiments (Fig. 1). Membranes were allowed to bind [3H]BK before addition of cross-linker. [3H]BK cross-linked to the membranes was determined by dissociating noncovalently bound [3H]BK. Each panel shows the increase in total [3H]BK binding, nonspecific [3H]BK binding, and cross-linked [3H]BK with increasing concentration of cross-linker. Nonspecific [3H]BK binding increased in parallel with total [3H]BK binding indicating that some [3H]BK was cross-linked to nonreceptor sites. The effectiveness of the cross-linkers is seen in the difference between cross-linked [3H]BK and nonspecific [3H]BK binding. The heterobifunctional reagents were considerably more effective than the homobifunctional reagents in cross-linking B2 receptor-bound [3H]BK (Fig. 1). MBS was the most effective reagent, resulting in nearly maximal cross-linking at concentrations as low as 5 μM. SMPB and SMCC, functionally identical to MBS but with longer spacer arms, were also significantly effective although to a lesser extent than MBS. The sulfhydryl alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) contains the same maleimide functional group as the above cross-linkers. When membranes were reacted with NEM, no cross-linking was observed. Thus, the heterobifunctional reagents were truly cross-linking BK rather than changing BK dissociation kinetics. SPDP, another heterobifunctional cross-linker which reacts via disulfide exchange to form a relatively labile disulfide bond, was also slightly effective in cross-linking. While the homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester reagents DSS, DST, and DSP were able to cross-link [3H]BK to the membranes, the cross-linking with these reagents at <1 mM was nonspecific, although minimal specific DSS cross-linking was observed at >1 mM. Interestingly, DFDNB displayed significant specific cross-linking ability.Agonist Cross-linking Specifically to a SulfhydrylTo demonstrate the importance of a sulfhydryl in cross-linking BK, membranes were treated with 10 mM NEM prior to cross-linking (Fig. 2). In control samples without NEM, the level of nondissociated radioligand was equal to the level of nonspecific binding (data not shown). With NEM, radioligand dissociation is decreased, resulting in slightly increased binding (see Table 1). NEM blocked cross-linking by all the heterobifunctional reagents down to control levels. Cross-linking was also blocked by phenylarsine oxide (PAO), which reacts with vicinal sulfhydryls, and iodoacetic acid (IAA), which alkylates free sulfhydryls (data not shown). DFDNB cross-linking was also blocked by the above sulfhydryl reagents, indicating that this cross-linker, which is usually considered to be homobifunctional in activity and structure, is reacting via a sulfhydryl in our system (Fig. 2; data not shown). The cross-linking observed with high concentrations of DSS was not blocked by NEM and therefore probably involves an amino group (data not shown).Figure 2:Effect of NEM pretreatment on cross-linking of [3H]BK to bovine myometrial membranes. Membranes (240 μg of protein) were pretreated without (open bars) and with (cross-hatched bars) 10 mM NEM. The membranes were then incubated with a constant concentration of [3H]BK (2.5 nM) followed by cross-linking with MBS (50 μM), SMCC (100 μM), SPDP (100 μM), and DFDNB (1 mM) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cross-linking is expressed as percent of total binding which was as shown in Fig. 2. The results are the averages ± S.E. of four experiments with each point assayed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A Sulfhydryl Is Not Required for Agonist B2 Receptor BindingSince a sulfhydryl is adjacent to the BK binding site, we examined the role of such a group in BK receptor binding. Membranes were pretreated with NEM, IAA, PAO, and the disulfide reducing agent DTT. As shown in Table 1, none of the sulfhydryl reagents inhibited [3H]BK binding at any of the concentrations tested (0.01-10 mM). Indeed, a small but significant increase in binding was consistently observed with these reagents. Therefore, while a sulfhydryl appears to be located in close proximity to the BK binding site, such a group is not directly involved in BK binding. Disulfide bonds also do not appear to be critical for BK binding to the expressed receptor as DTT only minimally inhibited [3H]BK binding.Identification of Cross-linked B2 Receptor-specific SpeciesThe identity of the cross-linked BK species was evaluated by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-BK antiserum. We performed titration curves of BK (0-5000 nM) cross-linking at 50 μM MBS in solubilized preparations of bovine myometrium (Fig. 3). At both 5 nM and 50 nM BK, the major cross-linked species detected was at 65 kDa. Increasing the BK concentration to 500 nM did not increase the intensity of the 65-kDa species indicating saturation of BK cross-linking. An intense 145-kDa doublet band appeared at 500 nM BK; species of 60-90 kDa appeared at higher BK concentrations. The cross-linking pattern at 5000 nM BK using 1 mM DFDNB was similar to that using 50 μM MBS including the presence of the 65-kDa species. Similar cross-linking patterns were observed in both soluble and membrane preparations (data not shown).Figure 3:Western blot of solubilized preparations of bovine myometrium cross-linked to BK with MBS. Solubilized preparations were incubated in the absence (lane 1) and presence of 5 nM BK (lane 2), 50 nM BK (lane 3), 500 nM BK (lane 4), and 5000 nM BK (lanes 5 and 6) for 60 min and then cross-linked with 50 μM MBS (lanes 1-5) or 1 mM DFDNB (lane 6) as indicated.

Bovine myometrial membranes contain two populations of B2 receptors(35Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One receptor population (50%) is of high affinity and sensitive to GTP, and another population (50%) is of low affinity and insensitive to Gpp(NH)p. Different concentrations of [3H]BK were used in experiments to determine if cross-linking of BK at 50 μM MBS occurred preferentially to the high or low affinity receptor subpopulations. Raising the [3H]BK concentration from 0.05 nM, which occupies 84% and 12% of the receptors, respectively(35Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to 2 nM, which occupies 100 and 84% of the receptors, respectively, decreased the MBS cross-linking efficiency 9.3 ± 2.2% (n = 3). Fig. 5A shows a dose-response curve of this effect. This decrease in efficiency corresponds to the increased BK occupancy of the low affinity receptor (12 to 84%). If both receptor subpopulations were equally available for cross-linking, no change in cross-linking efficiency would be observed with a change in the level of occupancy of the high and low affinity receptor populations. BK is cross-linked to the low affinity receptor population. However, the cross-linking efficiency is less than the efficiency to the high affinity receptor population.Figure 5:Cross-linking of different concentrations of [3H]BK and in the absence and presence of Gpp(NH)p.

Finally, the mechanism by which Rb activates the hIR promoter are presented. Insulin plays an important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism in addition to stimulating the growth and proliferation of cells. It binds to the insulin receptor with high affinity and exerts its effects by stimulating glucose, ion, and amino acid influx, and by modifying rate-limiting enzymes involved in glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism (Straus, 1984). Upon binding insulin, the insulin receptor phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), 1The abbreviations used are: IRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseSH2src-homology 2kbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s)hIRhuman insulin receptorRbretinoblastoma gene productTBPTATA-binding proteinRCEretinoblastoma control elementIGF-IIinsulin-like growth factor II. which then binds to various SH2 domain-containing signal transduction proteins.

The human insulin receptor (hIR) gene has been isolated and characterized by different groups (Seino et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1992; Araki et al., 1987; McKeon et al., 1990; Tewari et al., 1989), and its promoter is located within 700 bp upstream of the ATG codon. Multiple transcription initiation sites were mapped within the GC-rich region of the hIR promoter (Seino et al., 1989; Tewari et al., 1989). Like other housekeeping genes, the hIR promoter lacks the TATA and CAAT boxes. It is extremely GC-rich and contains multiple GC boxes that are binding sites for the mammalian transcription factor Sp1 (Lee et al., 1992; Araki et al., 1991; McKeon et al., 1990; Kadonaga et al., 1986). There are two GA and four overlapping GC boxes at −643 to −594, and these have been shown to be important for the expression of the hIR gene (Lee et al., 1992). Mutations of the GC and GA boxes markedly reduced the transcription of the hIR gene. Gel-shift analyses showed that Sp1 binds to the cluster of four GC boxes located from −593 to −618 (Lee et al., 1992; Araki et al., 1991; Cameron et al., 1992). In addition to the GC boxes, binding sites for two novel factors, insulin receptor nuclear factors; I and II (IRNF-I and IRNF-II), have also been demonstrated to bind to the −530 to −550 and the −500 to −520 regions of the hIR promoter, respectively. Mutations that abolished IRNF-I and IRNF-II binding greatly reduced the expression of the hIR gene, indicating that both factors are important for the hIR gene expression (Lee et al., 1992). Recently, our group has demonstrated that the E1a adenoviral oncoprotein can also transactivate hIR, and this is mediated through the Sp1-binding sites (Kim et al., 1994). Loss of binding activity of Sp1 to the GA and GC boxes located between −643 to −607 results in reduction of the basal activity and the loss of E1a inducibility of the hIR gene. Sp1 is a GC box-specific binding protein, which activates the transcription of many viral and cellular genes, including the SV40, epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2, and transforming growth factor-β1 gene as well as the hIR gene (Lee et al., 1992; Dynan and Tjian, 1983; Xu et al., 1993; Boisclair et al., 1993; Kim et al., 1991). The structure and function of Sp1 have been extensively characterized. The DNA-binding domain of Sp1 is located in the C terminus and consists of three C2H2 type zinc-finger motifs which bind to the GC boxes (Hoey et al., 1993; Kadonaga et al., 1986). There are two glutamine rich activation domains, A and B, which have transcriptional activity (Courey et al., 1989). These activation domains interact with the TFIID complex which consists of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and the multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs) (Gill and Tjian, 1992). The gene encoding TAFII-110 has been cloned and shown to interact with the A and B domains of Sp1 to mediate Sp1-dependent transcription (Hoey et al., 1993). Rb has been shown to regulate cell cycle progression and repress cell growth and differentiation (Bookstein et al., 1990; Horowitz et al., 1990). It has been demonstrated that Rb supresses growth related gene expression by directly inactivate transcription factors, including E2F, ATF-2, and Elf-1 (Bagchi et al., 1991; Chellappan et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1993; Kim et al., 1992a, 1992b). Hypophosphorylated forms of Rb have been shown to interact with E2F and its related family members through the conserved Rb pocket (Buchkovich et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1989; Pietenpol et al., 1990), and Rb-E2F interaction inhibits the transactivation function of E2F. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb by cyclin-cdk complexes, however, cause Rb to release E2F which is then free to transactivate its target gene (Bagchi et al., 1991; Chellappan et al., 1991; Dynlacht et al., 1994). Alternatively, Rb regulates cellular proliferation and cell cycle control by activating cellular genes, including c-fos, TGF-β1, and c-jun through a conserved cis-activating element, termed the retinoblastoma control element (RCE). RCE are GC-rich sequences, present in the promoter of the above genes. Sp1 binds to and stimulates transcription through the RCE motif (Kim et al. 1991, 1992a, 1992b; Pietenpol et al., 1991; Robbins et al., 1990; Yu et al., 1992; Chen et al., 1994). A protease sensitive Sp1 negative regulator (Sp1-I), which inhibits Sp1 binding to the Sp1 binding site of the c-jun promoter, has recently been identified (Chen et al., 1994). The inhibition of Sp1 binding by Sp1-I was reversed by the addition of bacterially expressed recombinant Rb, suggesting that Rb may sequester Sp1-I and release Sp1 from its inhibitor. The functional domain of Rb which interacts with the putative Sp1-I has not yet been defined. Insulin interacts with the insulin receptor to exert its role in long term cell proliferation and growth. Since Sp1 has been shown to be important for the regulation of transcription of the hIR gene and Rb has been shown to be able to regulate cell growth through either Sp1 binding to the RCE elements or via the E2F pathway, we investigated whether Rb can regulate hIR gene expression in a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. Our results demonstrate that Rb stimulates the expression of the hIR gene through Sp1 binding sites in the promoter. In addition overexpression of Sp1 can also augment hIR promoter activity, suggesting Sp1 can substitute for Rb to stimulate the hIR gene expression. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Rb can sequester Sp1-I, releasing Sp1 from the inhibitory factor Sp1-I, and allowing Sp1 to activate the hIR promoter activity. Finally and most importantly, we have defined the N-terminal domain of the Rb molecule responsible for the stimulation of the hIR gene promoter activity. This represents one of the first demonstrations of a functional role for these N-terminal regions of Rb. The wild type and 5′-deletion plasmids phIRCAT-1819, −873, −772, −643, −607, −574, and the linker-scanning mutants, phIRCAT-873 (LSGA, LSGC, and LSGAGC) have been described previously (Lee et al., 1992; Kim et al., 1994). The pCMV-Sp1 and pCMV-Sp1(N539) were constructed by inserting a pair of oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTATGC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGCATA-3′ into the XhoI fragment of pPACSp1 and pPACSp1(N539) (Gift from Dr. R. Tjian), and subcloned into the HindIII site of pCMV4 (Andersson et al., 1989). The pCMV-Rb expression vector was described previously (Qin et al., 1992). The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was maintained in 5% CO2 as a monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections were carried out by using 5 μg of the reporter and 2 μg of expression plasmids by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (Walker et al., 1983). The total amount of DNA used for transfections were kept constant by the addition of plasmid backbone as control. Cells were harvested 44-48 h. after transfection and lysed by three freeze and thaw cycles. Protein concentrations of cell extracts were quantified by the standard Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976), and 10-50 μg of protein were analyzed for CAT activity by TLC (Lee et al., 1992) or phase extraction methods (Seed et al., 1988). In the case of the TLC assays, the plates were counted by blot analyzer (Betascope 603, βetagen), and CAT activity was calculated as percent conversion of the substrate. Three independent transfection assays were carried out for each experiment, and the fold of stimulation represents the inducibility of hIR promoter activity. Rb is believed to regulate cell growth through two different pathways: via direct binding to transcription factors, such as E2F or through GC-rich DNA sequences. Sequence analysis of the hIR promoter indicated the existence of E2F as well as Sp1 binding sites. To investigate whether Rb regulates hIR gene expression, a construct containing the hIR promoter fused to a bacterial CAT reporter (hIR-1819) was co-transfected into HepG2 cells in the presence or absence of Rb. As indicated in Fig. 1, the promoter activity of the hIR-linked reporter is increased about 5.5-fold in the presence of Rb (lane 1 versus lane 2). As a control, the HepG2 cells were transfected with the pSV2CAT plasmid and the CAT activity is unaltered in the presence or absence of Rb (lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that Rb enhances hIR gene expression. To map the regions conferring Rb activation on the hIR gene, various 5′-deletion mutants of the hIR promoter fused to the CAT reporter were transfected in the presence or absence of the Rb expression vector. As summarized in Fig. 2, the construct containing a deletion to −873 has a similar fold of induction of CAT activity as that of the wild type. Further deletion to −772 only had a moderate effect on the inducibility by Rb. The deletion construct −643 showed decreased Rb-dependent stimulation of hIR gene expression, and further deletion to −607 had a dramatic effect on the inducibility by Rb. The deletion constructs −607 and −574, which still contain the putative E2F binding sites, showed no stimulation of the hIR gene expression in the presence of Rb. These results clearly indicate that deletion of the sequences upstream of −643 has no significant effect on Rb inducibility of the hIR promoter, however, deletion to −607 completely abolishes Rb-dependent stimulation of the hIR promoter. This suggests that the sequences between −643 to −607, which harbor two GA and three GC boxes, are important for the Rb-dependent regulation of the hIR gene. To further define the Rb responsive element between −643 and −607, linker-scanning mutants which have mutations in the GA boxes (LSGA), the GC boxes (LSGC), or both the GA and GC boxes (LSGAGC), were used in the transfection of HepG2 cells in the presence or the absence of Rb. As shown in Fig. 3, although the mutation in the GA boxes (LSGA) reduces the stimulation of the hIR gene expression by Rb, the mutation in the GC boxes (LSGC) has a much greater decrease in the Rb-dependent stimulation of hIR gene expression. Similar mutation with both GA and GC boxes mutated (LSGAGC) also abolishes Rb inducibility. These results indicate that the GC boxes between −643 and −607 are essential for the stimulation of the hIR promoter by Rb. Having identified the sequences within hIR promoter that are important for the Rb stimulation, we carried out experiments to identify the region within Rb that are important for this stimulation. For this purpose, we carried out cotransfection experiments using a series of mutants which have deletions within various parts of the Rb sequence (Qian et al., 1992). As shown in Fig. 4, deletion of 52 amino acids at the N-terminal end of Rb (between AA 37 and 89) completely abolishes the stimulation of hIR promoter activity by Rb. Deletion of another adjacent 51 amino acids (between amino acids 89 and 140), also significantly reduces the stimulation of hIR promoter activity by Rb. Similarly, deletion of the 46 amino acids immediately N-terminal to the A pocket (between amino acids 343 and 389), reduces the ability of Rb to stimulate the hIR promoter. In addition, deletion of the sequences between the A and B pockets (between amino acids 580 and 614), results in decreased stimulation of hIR promoter activity by Rb. In contrast, mutations in the region within the A or B pocket domain (between amino acids 389-580 and 614-775), or the C-terminal region of Rb (between amino acids 775 and 892), do not decrease the ability of Rb to stimulate the hIR promoter activity. These results indicate that the N-terminal region of Rb are important for its stimulation of the hIR promoter. In contrast, the A, B pocket domains and the C-terminal region are not essential for this stimulation. Since the A and B domains and C-terminal region of Rb are important for its interaction with E2F (Qian et al., 1992), these results are consistent with our previous observation that stimulation of hIR promoter activity by Rb is not mediated through E2F. We and others have previously shown that Sp1 binds to the GA and GC boxes between −643 and −607 of the hIR promoter (Lee et al., 1992; Araki et al. 1991). In addition, we have also demonstrated that these GA and GC boxes are required for the efficient expression of the hIR gene. Since these Sp1 binding sites were required for Rb-dependent stimulation, we asked whether Sp1 can substitute for Rb stimulation. To investigate this, a Sp1 expression vector, pCMV-Sp1, was co-transfected together with the hIR promoter-linked CAT construct phIRCAT-873 or the linker-scanning constructs with mutations in the GA and GC boxes into HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, Sp1 also stimulates the expression of the wild type hIR promoter (Fig. 5, lane 1 compared to lane 2), and the level of stimulation is similar to that seen with Rb (lane 3 compared to lane 2). Analogous to the stimulation exerted by Rb, mutation of the GA boxes (LSGA) does not significantly reduce the stimulation of the hIR gene expression by Sp1 (lanes 4, 5, and 6), but mutation of the GC boxes (LSGC) greatly decreases the stimulation of hIR gene expression by Sp1 (lanes 7, 8, and 9). Mutation of both the GA and GC boxes (LSGAGC) also completely eliminates the stimulation by Sp1 (lanes 10, 11, and 12). These results indicate that the GC box binding sites of Sp1 are essential for both the Sp1- and Rb-dependent activation of the hIR promoter. To investigate whether Rb and Sp1 stimulate the expression of the hIR gene through the same or different pathways, we titrated the Sp1-enhancement of the hIR promoter activity. For this purpose, increasing amounts of the Sp1 expression vector, pCMV-Sp1 were co-transfected into HepG2 cells with a constant amount of the hIR reporter construct. Fig. 6a (•) shows that the CAT reporter activities increase proportionally to the added amount of Sp1 expression vector until it reaches a saturating level at 2 μg. A similar experiment was carried out with increasing amounts of the Rb expression vector, and as shown in Fig. 6b (•), the CAT reporter activities also increase according to the amount of Rb expression vector added until a saturating level of Rb was used. We then asked whether co-expression of either Sp1 or Rb in the presence of saturating amounts of Rb or Sp1 respectively will further increase the hIR promoter activity. As illustrated in Fig. 6a (□), the addition of Sp1 at saturating amounts of Rb showed no further increase in the hIR expression. It is the same with co-expression of Rb at saturating level of Sp1 (6b □), indicating that the enhancement of hIR promoter activity by Rb and Sp1 is likely mediated through the same pathway. Rb is a 110-kDa nuclear protein that is modified by cell cycle-regulated hyperphosphorylations (Bandara et al., 1991; Buchkovich et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1989). Mutations in the RB-1 gene have been observed in a wide variety of tumors including retinoblastoma, osteosarcomas, bladder carcinomas, small-cell lung carcinomas, prostate carcinomas, and cervical carcinomas. The wide variety of tumors carrying mutated RB-1 genes suggest that Rb has an important role in the regulation of normal cell proliferation (for review, see Lees et al.(1991), Weinberg (1992), and Horowitz et al.(1990)). It has also been reported that functional replacement of the RB-1 gene can suppress tumorigenic phenotypes and inhibit growth in proliferating cells (Huang et al., 1991; Bookstein et al., 1990; Sumegi et al., 1990; Takahashi et al., 1991; Templeton et al., 1991). Rb has been shown to be able to complex with the oncoproteins encoded by several DNA tumor viruses, including adenovirus E1a, simian virus 40 T antigen, and human papillomavirus 7 (DeCaprio et al., 1989; Dyson et al., 1989; Whyte et al., 1988). Recently, Rb has also been shown to bind to the cellular E2F transcription factor, and repress E2F-mediated gene expression thereby suppressing cellular proliferation. The cell cycle regulated hyper-phosphorylated form of Rb, however, can no longer associate with E2F, and thereby loses the ability to repress E2F-regulated transactivation (Bagchi et al., 1991; Dynlacht et al., 1994; Buchkovich et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1989; Pietenpol et al., 1990). These results suggested that Rb has a very important role in regulating cell cycle progression and in repressing cell growth and differentiation. Another target of Rb is the Sp1 family of transcription factors which binds to the RCE and activate RCE containing genes. Robbins et al.(1990) demonstrated that in the c-fos promoter, Rb can repress the transcription of c-fos through the RCE and reduce the AP-1 stimulatory activity. Similarly, Kim et al. (1992a) showed that RCE-like sequences are important for positive regulation of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) gene by human Rb. Furthermore, they have shown that the TGF-β1 and c-fos promoters can both be positively and negatively regulated by Rb through the same RCE element in different cell types (Kim et al., 1992b). Subsequently, they demonstrated that Rb regulates the expression of IGF-II through Sp1 (Kim et al., 1992b), and that Sp1 binding to DNA is not required, since a GAL4-Sp1 fusion protein can also confer the transcriptional regulation by Rb. We have shown here that Rb can stimulate the expression of the hIR gene by 5-6-fold. Rb-dependent stimulation is mediated through sequences between −643 and −607, which contains two GA and three GC boxes through which Sp1 binds. By either deleting the GC-rich sequences between −643 and −607 or mutating the GC boxes for Sp1 binding in this region, we have demonstrated that the Rb-dependent stimulation is eliminated. Our results indicate that the Rb-dependent stimulation of the hIR promoter is mediated through Sp1-binding sites. These results are similar to those observed with the c-jun and TGF-β1 promoters (Kim et al., 1991; 1992a; Chen et al., 1994). Recently, Chen et al.(1994) showed that Rb can stimulate the c-jun promoter activity. A 20-kDa protein has been implicated to have the ability to prevent the binding of Sp1 to DNA. This Sp1 inhibitor (Sp1-I) is a heat-labile and proteinase K-sensitive protein, which presumably interacts with both Sp1 and Rb. When it binds to Sp1, it prevents Sp1 from binding to DNA, hence inhibiting the ability of Sp1 to transactivate target genes. In its presence, Rb competes with Sp1 for the Sp1-I binding, thus releasing Sp1 and allowing it to bind to the GC boxes and transactivate target genes. For the hIR, we have not been able to detect the direct association of Rb with Sp1 by immunoprecipitation and supershifts in gel mobility assays, suggesting that Rb stimulation of the hIR promoter is not through direct interaction with Sp1. 2W.-J. Shen and S. Y. Tsai, unpublished results. Therefore, it is likely that Sp1-I, similar to the c-jun system (Chen et al., 1994), interacts with Rb and releases Sp1 for the hIR gene stimulation. If this is the case, overexpression of Sp1 should be able to replace Rb in the hIR promoter stimulation. Indeed as shown in Fig. 5, overexpression of Sp1 could substitute for Rb as it enhances the hIR expression to a similar extent as the Rb-dependent activation. This is consistent with the notion that Rb sequesters Sp1-I and releases Sp1 from its inhibition, leading to the activation of the hIR promoter activity. This conclusion is further supported by the failure of Rb to further stimulate the hIR promoter activity at a saturating amount of Sp1 (Fig. 6). Thus, the enhancement of hIR promoter activity by Rb and Sp1 is likely mediated through the same pathway; and the role of Rb is to sequester Sp1-I, removing it from inhibition of the activity of Sp1. Rb contains multiple functional domains, including two discontiguous regions, the A and B pockets, and a N- and a C-terminal domains. The A and B pockets, located at amino acids 389-580 and 614-775, are required for interactions with DNA tumor virus antigens, E1a, and transcription factor E2F (Qian et al. 1992; Hu et al., 1990; Kaelin, et al., 1990). The N-terminal domain consists of three regions which contain kinase recognition sites (Qian et al., 1992; Qin et al., 1992) and has been proposed to be important for hyperphosphorylation of Rb (Qian et al., 1992). Although this domain has been implicated to be involved in growth suppression, a biological function for this region has not been well defined (Karantza et al., 1993; Hogg et al. 1993; Dryja et al., 1993). We have shown here that the N-terminal regions (amino acids 37-89, 89-140, and 343-389) are important for stimulation of hIR promoter activity. In addition, the sequences between the A and B pockets (amino acids 580-614) which contains putative phosphorylation sites are also important for the stimulation. In contrast, the A and B pockets, which are important for interaction with E2F are not essential for activation of hIR promoter activity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Rb stimulation of hIR is mediated through sequestering Sp1-I rather than binding to E2F. Most importantly, we have defined the N-terminal region of Rb to be involved in activation of hIR promoter activity. This represents one of the first assigned biological function for this region.
