https://openalex.org/W2071609209,"A method has been proposed for deriving a characteristic determining flow in porous systems. This characteristic combines both area and path-length factors used by earlier authors. For a gas, diffusive flow is proportional to the 4/3 power of the gas-filled porosity, and this function has been derived from consideration of the planar distribution of spherical pores and the interaction of two adjacent planes."

https://openalex.org/W2092521372,"Newborn rats, fed either cow's milk or rat's milk by tube, developed a ""bloat"" and the time required for emptying the stomach increased. When these animals were allowed to suckle on nonlactating foster mothers, no evidence of this syndrome was observed. Based on these observations, a technique was developed for the artificial feeding of newborn rats. When the diet was rat's milk, growth equivalent to that of animals fed solely by lactating females was obtained. A diet of cow's milk did not support adequate growth."
https://openalex.org/W2057554920,"A method for comparing the effectiveness of undergraduate colleges in stimulating their students to seek the Ph.D. is described. The procedure yields separate measures of productivity in the natural sciences and in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, adjusted to control differences in college talent supplies. The results suggest that the productivity measures have substantial validity, and argue for the importance of faculty behaviors in stimulating or inhibiting intellectual achievement."
https://openalex.org/W1993850670,"If electroconvulsive shock is given immediately after a learning trial, retrograde amnesia for that response occurs. The usual interpretation of such amnesia states that a neural engram, after a learning trial, requires a certain amount of time to consolidate, and electroconvulsive shock interferes with this consolidation, producing amnesia. Four studies are summarized which indicate that convulsive shock serves as an unconditioned stimulus producing a convulsive response, that takes precedence over other behavior, and part of which becomes conditioned to stimuli in the learning situation. The convulsive response competes with, and replaces, the previous response, resulting in the appearance of amnesia."
https://openalex.org/W2012856807,"Simultaneous x-ray diffraction and electrical resistance measurements on barium establish, with certainty, that Bridgman's 78-kb resistance transition is identical with his 59-kb volume transition. During this transition, the body-centered cubic structure changes to hexagonal-close packed. Lattice parameters for the latter structure at 62 kb (volume scale) are: a = 3.90 Å, c = 6.15 Å, and c/a = 1.58. Compression (ΔV/V0) at 62 kb is 0.359 ± 0.005 compared to 0.345 previously reported by Bridgman. Below the transition, at 49 kb, compression is 0.300 ± 0.005 compared to Bridgman's 0.288. Bridgman's 17-kb volume transition was not detected by x-ray diffraction."
https://openalex.org/W2074305292,"Measurements were made of the partitioning of total body water in the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, between intracellular and extracellular compartments and the division of the latter into interstitial fluid and plasma. The apportionment of body water in agnathans is very similar to that in elasmobranchs, and both of these primitive groups differ from what is known of the more advanced teleosts."
https://openalex.org/W2093249532,"Developments in the determination of absolute rate constants, made possible by the availability of electron accelerators that can deliver a highly intense electron pulse of microsecond duration, are reviewed. Characteristics of the electron pulse and the physical arrangement for irradiation of samples and detection of transient species at Argonne National Laboratory are indicated. Important observations arising from the Argonne technique are discussed. Among these are the primary species in irradiated water, a variety of aromatic and aliphatic free radicals in both water and organic liquids, and one of the primary species formed in the radiolysis of polar organic liquids. Implications of the pulse radiolysis method for future research are presented. (H.M.G.)"
https://openalex.org/W2051504789,A rare and unusual species of Podocarpus from New Caledonia was collected and discovered to be parasitic on another conifer. The attachment is by modified roots imbedded between the cork cambium and the vascular cambium. A parasitic gymnosperm is something new to science.
https://openalex.org/W2082605795,"A three-dimensional x-ray analylsis of a crystallinie solid of Xe(+8) formed by the reaction of XeF(6) with sodium hydroxide solution indicates that it is sodium perxenate octahydrate, Na(4)XeO(6) * 8H(2)O. The perxenate ion, XeO(6)(-4), has approximately a regular octahedral configuration with a mean xenon-oxygen bond length of 1.875 A."
https://openalex.org/W1983339202,"Montmorillonite, illite, chlorite, and kaolinite in the playas of southern California are traceable directly to the source areas surrounding the basins. No evidence found in this investigation suggests that these clay minerals are unstable in the sodic or calcic saline lake environment, but this conclusion may not be directly applied to marine evaporite facies where the minerals are rich in potassium and magnesium."
https://openalex.org/W1987625004,"Fully diapausing silkworm embryos (Bombyx mori L.) ordinarily never reach the stage of appendage formation when they are cultured singly in hanging drops. However, when they are cultured side-by-side with nondiapausing embryos, they survive longer and some even achieve appendage formation."
https://openalex.org/W2058431295,"Relatively high concentrations of surface ozone and the indication that ozone is the inciting agent in fleck injury to tobacco were reported previously (1). Considerable interest therefore attaches to weather parameters on the high-ozone days which may throw light on the source and on the physicochemical processes affecting the ozone level. A source in the direction of nearby Washington, D.C., and photochemical production of the oxidant are indicated. Days with appropriate wind direction but low peak ozone concentration are discussed in terms of coexisting weather parameters. The weather ensemble found on highozone days is considered in relation to instances of fleck injury for which peak ozone levels were not measured."
https://openalex.org/W2070012352,"A marine form of nematode, Aphelenchoides sp., can develop and reproduce effectively on viable mycelia of various filamentous fungi including certain widespread marine species. The efficiency of utilization of fungal mycelium by the animal, based on the ratio of the number of nematodes to the dry weight of fungal mycelium, varies greatly among fungi, from less than 100 to as much as 5000 for several of the marine species studied."
https://openalex.org/W1978186909,"An investigation of Quaternary, Tertiary, Mesozoic, and Paleozoic pollen and spores found in sediments of the Biscay Abyssal Plain provides data leading to the interpretation of the provenance of the lutite in which reworked plant microfossils occur. Owing to the difficulty of distinguishing between Quaternary and reworked Tertiary pollen grains belonging to extant genera, caution is necessary in interpreting the pollen record in terms of Quaternary climatic changes."

https://openalex.org/W2005177827,"X-ray analyses of samples from lacustrine deposits in the Kramer borate district of California show that montmorillonite is the dominant clay mineral, and that illite is abundant in red siltstones, common in green and gray borate-barren claystones, and sparse in borate-bearing rocks. Kaolinite is present only in red siltstones. The distribution of clay minerals is related to the geologic history of borate deposition."
