Twenty-four hours later they were tested under the same or different conditions. In tasks measuiring recall and interference, learning transfer was better when the subject was intoxicated during both sessions than when he was intoxicated only during the learning session. In a task measuring recognition, transfer was not significantly affected by changing state. Thus, alcohol appears to produce ""dissociated"" or state-dependent effects in man, but not all forms of memory are equally sensitive to the phenomenon."

https://openalex.org/W2095120588,"Isolated intact mitochondria selectively incorporate monosaccharides from nucleotide diphosphate monosaccharides into protein. Fucose, mannose, glucose, and galactose were incorporated by the mitochondria into glycoprotein; xylose was not. Structural integrity of the mitochondria was not necessary for the incorporation of monosaccharide into glycoprotein; mitochondria broken by homogenization also incorporated monosaccharide. The monosaccharides incorporated into glycoprotein were localized in the inner mitochondrial membranes, the same membranes which contain the protein into which leucine is incorporated by the isolated mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1993559146,"Synthesis of lactate dehydrogenase in somatic and gametic tissues of certain avian and mammalian species is controlled by alleles at three loci, A, B, and C. We report breeding experiments with pigeons that conclusively demonstrate linkage between the B and C structural loci in this species. The most probable recombination fraction is zero, and contiguity is not excluded. The upper 95 percent probability limit is 4.5 percent. This tight linkage of two loci that produce closely similar polypeptides suggests that the loci acquired their separate identities through a duplication event. Furthermore, the existence of recognizable B- and C-type polypeptides in both the bird and the mammal suggests that the event and the resulting linkage preceded the separation of these fauna. If so, then the linkage has persisted for a very long time."

https://openalex.org/W2018226671,"Both high and low CO2 compensation concentrations were found in the plant genera-Panicum, Cyperus, and Euphorbia. Within each genus, however, high and low compensations were found in different subgenera. Thus, they may not be genetically closely related. No significant differences in CO2 compensation were found among 100 genetic lines of Triticum aestivum L. or among 20 lines of Hordeum vulgare L."
https://openalex.org/W2061419571,"FISHER'S fundamental theorem of natural selection1 states that for a random mating population with fitnesses dependent on the genetic constitution at a single locus, the mean fitness of the population increases with time. This is true for an arbitrary number of possible alleles at the locus and for arbitrary fitness values."
https://openalex.org/W2068074991,"Cataglyphis bicolor, an ant widely distributed in North Africa and the Near East, orient to the sun as well as to visual patterns of the environment. These two mechanisms can be separated. Foraging ants (hunters) orient to terrestrial cues as long as possible, and only after these have become ineffective do they switch over to the menotactical sun orientation. In the digging individuals, however, the visual knowledge of locality is significantly inferior to that of the hunters. Diggers vary considerably in size, but hunters belong to the largest size group. In addition, the largest and smallest individuals orient differently toward black and white areas and stripe patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2033287759,"Coumarin anticoagulants inhibit the release of plasma clotting factor VII by vitamin K in liver slices from vitamin K-deficient animals without inhibition of protein synthesis. When the ratio of vitamin K to coumarin anticoagulant is kept constant, but the concentrations are increased, the inhibition disappears. This suggests that the pharmacological action of coumarin anticoagulants depends on irreversible inhibition of normal vitamin K transport to its site of action. At higher concentrations of vitamin K the inhibition can be surmounted, because vitamin K can enter the cell by an alternate route that is not inhibited by coumarin anticoagulants."
https://openalex.org/W2090820925,"Thymine-thymine adduct is a product isolated from thymine irradiated with ultraviolet light in frozen aqueous solution. This compound is presumably formed through the rearrangement of an initial photoproduct. Single crystal x-ray diffraction analysis has confirmed the molecular formula of the adduct, 5-hydroxy-6-4'-(5'-methylpyrimid-2'-one)-dihydrothymine, except for the possibility of a hydrogen atom on the 3' nitrogren rather than the 1' nitrogen, and has established the stereoconfiguration of the molecule."

Generalization functions that were determined in the presence of light A showed control of behavior by the frequency of the tone; those determined in the presence of light B did not."

Attractiveness of the larvae is related to their size, shape, and color but not to their movement. The possibility that wild mosquitoes substitute insect hemolymph for vertebrate blood is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1980116888,"IN view of the possibility that memory, such as that acquired in learning, is represented by some permanent change in the brain, and that the change is brought about as a result of chemical activity in the brain cell, we carried out experiments to observe whether various stimulating agents affect nucleotide and RNA biosynthesis in isolated brain. We examined the effects of electrical stimulation, and of changes in the cation composition of the incubation medium and of acetylcholine, on the rates of incorporation of labelled uridine into uridine nucleotides and RNA in slices of rat brain cortex. The results are summarized here. Full details will be published elsewhere."

https://openalex.org/W2162619821,"In a survey of the gonads of 97 species of North American freshwater mussels representing 59 genera, only four species were found to be hermaphroditic (monoecious). Among several other ""occasional"" hermaphrodites, two were unique in that the same follicles in the gonads produced eggs and sperm simultaneously. Evidently the control mechanism failed to function normally in these species [Actinonaias ellipsiformis and villosa (formely micromya) iris (Lea)]. This simultaneous production of eggs ans sperm is apparently quite unusual among mollusks."

https://openalex.org/W2083049304,"THE late biological effects of skeletally deposited radium in man have long been used as a basis for setting maximum permissible body contents of both radium itself and other long lived bone-seeking radio-elements such as plutonium1. Knowledge of the retention pattern is a fundamental requirement in the relation of the body content of radium at the time of observation of a bone neoplasm to the amount of radium initially in the blood. Much effort is being devoted to a determination of this, chiefly in the United States1–3 where a number of persons who received radium by injection or occupationally have been studied at intervals for many years. These people have radium-226 contents in the approximate range 0.02–2.0 µCi, levels which are easily measured by whole body gamma ray spectrometry. Only relatively few measurements have been made, however, and the accuracy of the estimated biological elimination rate for an individual is poor. Keane and Evans2 reported an average biological half life of 28 ± 8 yr for a group of twenty subjects, 30–40 yr after acquisition, while Miller and Finkel3 found an average of 15 yr (range 9.6–21.7 yr) for the biological half life in eight patients for the period 19–33 yr after injection."

This report is of a pilot study designed to measure the gross effects of dietary supplements of chlortetracycline on the rate of growth of the wool of sheep given rations which differed appreciably in protein concentration."
