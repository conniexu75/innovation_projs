https://openalex.org/W1986876156,"In laboratory experiments, mixed populations of two marine copepods (Acartia clausi and Eurytemora herdmani) when fed artificial food particles consisting of microcapsules that were either enriched with an encapsulated homogenate of naturally occurring phytoplankton or nonenriched preferentially ingested the enriched capsules. Beads or nonenriched capsules were either seldom ingested or not ingested at all. The observations demonstrate that filter-feeding in these species is a behavioral process, under sensory control, and that the copepods are able to discriminate between enriched and nonenriched food particles."
https://openalex.org/W2137321978,"Some 60 years ago, many biologists thought that bees and other insects were totally color-blind animals. I was unable to believe it. For the bright colors of flowers can be understood only as an adaptation to color-sensitive visitors. This was the beginning of experiments on the color sense of the bee (I). On a table outdoors I placed a colored paper between papers of different shades of gray and on it I laid a small glass dish filled with sugar syrup. Bees from a nearby hive could be trained to recognize this color and demonstrated their ability to distinguish it from shades of gray. To prevent too great a gathering of bees, I instituted breaks between feedings. After these breaks, only sporadic scout bees came to the empty bowl and flew back home; the feeding table remained deserted. If a scout bee, however, found the bowl filled and returned home successfully, within a few minutes the entire forager group was back. Had she reported her findings to the hive? This question subsequently became the starting point for further investigations. In order that the behavior of foragers could be seen after their return to the hive, a small colony was placed in an observation hive with glass windows, and a feeding bowl was placed next to it. The individual foragers were marked with colored dots, that is, numbered according to a certain system. Now an astonishing picture could be seen in the observation hive: Even before the returning bees turned over the contents of their honey sack to other bees, they ran over the comb in close circles, alternately to the right and the left. This round dance caused the numbered bees moving behind them to undertake a new excursion to the feeding place. But foragers from one hive do not always fly to the same feeding source. Foraging groups form: One may collect from dandelions, another from clover, and a third from forget-me-nots. Even in flowering plants the food supply often becomes scarce, and a “feeding break” ensues. Were the bees in the experiment able to alert those very same foragers who were at the bowl with them? Did they know each other individually? To settle the question, I installed two feeding places at which two groups from the same observation hive collected separately. During a feeding break, both groups stayed on the honey-comb and mingled with each other. Then one of the bowls was refilled. The bees coming from the filled bowl alerted by their dances not only their own group but also bees of the second group, which responded by flying to their customary feeding place where they investigated the empty bowl. However, the natural stopping places of bees are not glass bowls but flowers. Therefore, the experiment was modified; one of two groups of bees collected food from linden blossoms, the other one from robinias. Now the picture"
https://openalex.org/W2067617968,Collections of stream organisms from a domestic water supply system adjacent to the Tobacco River revealed that a detritus-based community exists in subterranean waters circulating through floodplain gravels at least 4.2 meters below and 50 meters laterally from the river channel. Several stone fly species spend their entire nymphal life cycles in underground habitats of the Flathead and Tobacco rivers.
https://openalex.org/W2056860458,"Opal phytoliths and freshwater diatoms, transported mainly in dust to the equatorial Atlantic, are common in sediments deposited when ocean waters were cool, and sparse in those deposited when waters were warm, during the last 1.8 million years. Climate in source areas of the southern Sahara apparently was more arid during glacials and more humid during interglacials."
https://openalex.org/W1971193009,Analyses of the floras of the high north Andean habitat islands (paramos) and the Galápagos Islands show that plant species diversity conforms to the MacArthur and Wilson model of island biogeography but that immigration occurred primarily during glacial periods. Modern plant species diversity is more significantly correlated with area and distance measures of the glacial forms of the islands than with similar measures of the present-day islands.

The strongest features observed were the Lyman alpha line of neutral atomic hydrogen at 1216 angstroms and the hydroxyl (OH) bands at 3090 and 3142 angstroms. Atomic oxygen and atomic carbon were also detected, and their luminosity implies a production rate (of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide) commensurate with that of water vapor."
https://openalex.org/W2058068581,"Emissions of atomic oxygen (1304 angstroms), atomic carbon (1657 angstroms), and atomic hydrogen (1216 angstroms) from Comet Kohoutek were observed with ultraviolet cameras carried on a sounding rocket on 8 January 1974. Analysis of the Lyman alpha halo at 1216 angstroms gave an atomic hydrogen production rate of 4.5 x 10(29) atoms per second."

https://openalex.org/W2090466367,"A Pennsylvanian arborescent lycopod cone, Lepidostrobus schopfii, has microspores that have been found to have intracellular features that are interpreted as nuclei and mitotic chromosomes. The cellularized gametophytes conform to the early stages of growth that occur in modern Selaginella microgametophytes. Since the megagametophyte of L. schopfii is similar in development to extant species of Isoetes, the fossil now is known to have portions of its life cycle in common with both Selaginella and Isoetes."
https://openalex.org/W2019495467,"Quantitative analyses of purines and pyrimidines in sequential sections of cores from the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie show steeply increasing concentrations in the youngest sediments. This may be related to increased loading of nutrients and recent cultural eutrophication of the lake. The purine and pyrimidine distributions suggest the operation of a specific degradative process for uracil at an extremely early stage in, or prior to, sediment formation."

https://openalex.org/W2045831858,"If energy conservation were a goal of a federal budget policy maker, such conservation could be achieved by reinvesting the highway trust fund in any of several other alternative federal programs (except criminal justice), especially in railroad and mass transit construction and national health insurance (see Table 1). Total employment would increase in each alternative program examined. For example, if construction monies were shifted from highways to railroads, the energy required for construction would be reduced by about 62 percent and employment would increase by 3.2 percent. By comparing the dollar, energy, and employment requirements of a highway transportation system with such requirements for a railroad transportation system, we obtained detailed information from which we concluded the following: 1) Passenger transport by railroad was much less dollar and energy demanding and required more labor than car transport in 1963. If the dollar savings had been respent in an average way by consumers, the net impact would have been to reduce the energy savings and further increase employment. A similar conclusion was reached in a study of bus substitution for automobiles in urban areas (20). If the marginal substitution effects would have held over the whole range of change, and the dollar savings had been spent on the construction of railways, then about 3.0 billion gallons of gasoline could have been saved annually and 1.2 million new jobs created. 2) Freight transport by railroad was less expensive, in terms of dollar, energy, and labor requirements, than was truck transportation in 1963. If, under a national shift to rail freight, the dollar savings had been absorbed as personal consumption expenditures, a net increase of labor and energy would have ensued. If the dollar savings had been absorbed as a tax and respent on railroad and mass transit construction, about 0.3 billion more gallons of gasoline (energy equivalent) would have been consumed annually and 1.2 million jobs created, under a complete shift to rail. Had there been a full shift from intercity car and truck transportation to transportation by railroad with dollar savings spent on railway construction, 2.7 billion gallons of gasoline (energy equivalent) could have been saved and 2.4 million new jobs could have been created in 1963."
https://openalex.org/W2037925121,The phase velocity and the quality factor (Q) of mantle Rayleigh waves from the great Kurile Islands earthquake of 1963 have a close azimuthal correlation with each other and differ considerably among different paths. Serious error may be introduced in the interpretation of observed regionality in phase velocity if regional differences in Q are ignored.

https://openalex.org/W1987336187,"The Lamont-Doherty tripartite array of microphones has detected acoustic signals from meteors. These signals yield trace velocities which vary rapidly from supersonic to nearly infinite values for successive waves or wave groups, indicating a rapidly moving source. The trajectory is constructed on the basis of an assumption of reasonable path elevations. With a second array it would be possible to obtain more positive trajectory fixes and probable ground impact locations. Initial results suggest that most acoustic meteors are meteorite-type objects rather than the low-density objects commonly detected at high elevations by photographic and radio techniques."
