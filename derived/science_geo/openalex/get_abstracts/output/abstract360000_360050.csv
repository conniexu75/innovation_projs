https://openalex.org/W2163798887,"Determining the genetic basis of cancer requires comprehensive analyses of large collections of histopathologically well-classified primary tumours. Here we report the results of a collaborative study to discover somatic mutations in 188 human lung adenocarcinomas. DNA sequencing of 623 genes with known or potential relationships to cancer revealed more than 1,000 somatic mutations across the samples. Our analysis identified 26 genes that are mutated at significantly high frequencies and thus are probably involved in carcinogenesis. The frequently mutated genes include tyrosine kinases, among them the EGFR homologue ERBB4; multiple ephrin receptor genes, notably EPHA3; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR; and NTRK genes. These data provide evidence of somatic mutations in primary lung adenocarcinoma for several tumour suppressor genes involved in other cancers--including NF1, APC, RB1 and ATM--and for sequence changes in PTPRD as well as the frequently deleted gene LRP1B. The observed mutational profiles correlate with clinical features, smoking status and DNA repair defects. These results are reinforced by data integration including single nucleotide polymorphism array and gene expression array. Our findings shed further light on several important signalling pathways involved in lung adenocarcinoma, and suggest new molecular targets for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2054064167,"Studies of nitric oxide over the past two decades have highlighted the fundamental importance of gaseous signaling molecules in biology and medicine. The physiological role of other gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is now receiving increasing attention. Here we show that H2S is physiologically generated by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and that genetic deletion of this enzyme in mice markedly reduces H2S levels in the serum, heart, aorta, and other tissues. Mutant mice lacking CSE display pronounced hypertension and diminished endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. CSE is physiologically activated by calcium-calmodulin, which is a mechanism for H2S formation in response to vascular activation. These findings provide direct evidence that H2S is a physiologic vasodilator and regulator of blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2025905047,"“Warmth” is the most powerful personality trait in social judgment, and attachment theorists have stressed the importance of warm physical contact with caregivers during infancy for healthy relationships in adulthood. Intriguingly, recent research in humans points to the involvement of the insula in the processing of both physical temperature and interpersonal warmth (trust) information. Accordingly, we hypothesized that experiences of physical warmth (or coldness) would increase feelings of interpersonal warmth (or coldness), without the person's awareness of this influence. In study 1, participants who briefly held a cup of hot (versus iced) coffee judged a target person as having a “warmer” personality (generous, caring); in study 2, participants holding a hot (versus cold) therapeutic pad were more likely to choose a gift for a friend instead of for themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2077637812,"It is debated whether species-level differences in ecological strategy, which play a key role in much of coexistence theory, are important in structuring highly diverse communities. We examined the co-occurrence patterns of over 1100 tree species in a 25-hectare Amazonian forest plot in relation to field-measured functional traits. Using a null model approach, we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore, we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy, suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring. Our results show that strategy differentiation among species contributes to the maintenance of diversity in one of the most diverse tropical forests in the world."
https://openalex.org/W2109610561,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal brain tumour presenting as one of two subtypes with distinct clinical histories and molecular profiles. The primary GBM subtype presents acutely as a high-grade disease that typically harbours mutations in EGFR, PTEN and INK4A/ARF (also known as CDKN2A), and the secondary GBM subtype evolves from the slow progression of a low-grade disease that classically possesses PDGF and TP53 events. Here we show that concomitant central nervous system (CNS)-specific deletion of p53 and Pten in the mouse CNS generates a penetrant acute-onset high-grade malignant glioma phenotype with notable clinical, pathological and molecular resemblance to primary GBM in humans. This genetic observation prompted TP53 and PTEN mutational analysis in human primary GBM, demonstrating unexpectedly frequent inactivating mutations of TP53 as well as the expected PTEN mutations. Integrated transcriptomic profiling, in silico promoter analysis and functional studies of murine neural stem cells (NSCs) established that dual, but not singular, inactivation of p53 and Pten promotes an undifferentiated state with high renewal potential and drives increased Myc protein levels and its associated signature. Functional studies validated increased Myc activity as a potent contributor to the impaired differentiation and enhanced renewal of NSCs doubly null for p53 and Pten (p53(-/-) Pten(-/-)) as well as tumour neurospheres (TNSs) derived from this model. Myc also serves to maintain robust tumorigenic potential of p53(-/-) Pten(-/-) TNSs. These murine modelling studies, together with confirmatory transcriptomic/promoter studies in human primary GBM, validate a pathogenetic role of a common tumour suppressor mutation profile in human primary GBM and establish Myc as an important target for cooperative actions of p53 and Pten in the regulation of normal and malignant stem/progenitor cell differentiation, self-renewal and tumorigenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2012076962,"BAX is a pro-apoptotic protein of the BCL-2 family that is stationed in the cytosol until activated by a diversity of stress stimuli to induce cell death. Anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL-2 counteract BAX-mediated cell death. Although an interaction site that confers survival functionality has been defined for anti-apoptotic proteins, an activation site has not been identified for BAX, rendering its explicit trigger mechanism unknown. We previously developed stabilized α-helix of BCL-2 domains (SAHBs) that directly initiate BAX-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Here we demonstrate by NMR analysis that BIM SAHB binds BAX at an interaction site that is distinct from the canonical binding groove characterized for anti-apoptotic proteins. The specificity of the human BIM-SAHB–BAX interaction is highlighted by point mutagenesis that disrupts functional activity, confirming that BAX activation is initiated at this novel structural location. Thus, we have now defined a BAX interaction site for direct activation, establishing a new target for therapeutic modulation of apoptosis. The trigger mechanism by which apoptosis-inducing proteins such as BAX become activated remains a matter of vigorous debate. Here, a structural analysis of full length BAX in complex with a peptide derived from its activator BIM reveals a novel and unforeseen interaction site. This does not involve the classic hydrophobic groove reported for inhibitors of apoptosis. The identification of BAX's activation site not only provides mechanistic insights into a cell's demise, but also adds a potential new therapeutic target to the list of apoptosis modulators. A structural analysis of the apoptosis-inducing protein BAX in complex with a peptide derived from its activator BIM reveals an unforeseen interaction site that does not involve the classic hydrophobic groove reported for inhibitors of apoptosis. This identification of BAX's activation site provides mechanistic insights into a cell's demise."

https://openalex.org/W2013158844,"Recent findings suggest important roles for nuclear organization in gene expression. In contrast, little is known about how nuclear organization contributes to genome stability. Epistasis analysis (E-MAP) using DNA repair factors in yeast indicated a functional relationship between a nuclear pore subcomplex and Slx5/Slx8, a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)–dependent ubiquitin ligase, which we show physically interact. Real-time imaging and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed stable recruitment of damaged DNA to nuclear pores. Relocation required the Nup84 complex and Mec1/Tel1 kinases. Spontaneous gene conversion can be enhanced in a Slx8- and Nup84-dependent manner by tethering donor sites at the nuclear periphery. This suggests that strand breaks are shunted to nuclear pores for a repair pathway controlled by a conserved SUMO-dependent E3 ligase."
https://openalex.org/W2069680569,"During the development of multicellular organisms, organogenesis and pattern formation depend on formative divisions to specify and maintain pools of stem cells. In higher plants, these activities are essential to shape the final root architecture because the functioning of root apical meristems and the de novo formation of lateral roots entirely rely on it. We used transcript profiling on sorted pericycle cells undergoing lateral root initiation to identify the receptor-like kinase ACR4 of Arabidopsis as a key factor both in promoting formative cell divisions in the pericycle and in constraining the number of these divisions once organogenesis has been started. In the root tip meristem, ACR4 shows a similar action by controlling cell proliferation activity in the columella cell lineage. Thus, ACR4 function reveals a common mechanism of formative cell division control in the main root tip meristem and during lateral root initiation."

https://openalex.org/W1996861095,"S6K1 (p70S6K) is a serine kinase downstream from Akt in the insulin signaling pathway that is involved in negative feedback regulation of insulin action. S6K1 is also activated by TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. However, its role remains to be characterized. In the current study, we elucidated a mechanism for S6K1 to mediate TNF-α-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes and hepatocytes. S6K1 was phosphorylated at Thr-389 in response to TNF-α. This led to phosphorylation of IRS-1 by S6K1 at multiple serine residues including Ser-270, Ser-307, Ser-636, and Ser-1101 in human IRS-1 (Ser-265, Ser-302, Ser-632, and Ser-1097, in rodent IRS-1). Direct phosphorylation of these sites by S6K1 was observed in an in vitro kinase assay using purified IRS-1 and S6K1. Phosphorylation of all these serines was increased in the adipose tissue of obese mice. RNAi knockdown demonstrated an important role for S6K1 in mediating TNF-α-induced IRS-1 inhibition that led to impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. A point mutant of IRS-1 (S270A) impaired association of IRS-1 with S6K1 resulting in diminished phosphorylation of IRS-1 at three other S6K1 phosphorylation sites (Ser-307, Ser-636, and Ser-1101). Expression of a dominant negative S6K1 mutant prevented TNF-induced Ser-270 phosphorylation and IRS-1 protein degradation. Moreover, in IKK2 (but not IKK1)-null cells, TNF-α treatment did not result in Thr-389 phosphorylation of S6K1.

It remains to be determined which pathway mediates the S6K activation by TNF-α. Given the potentially important role of S6K and TNF-α in the control of insulin sensitivity, it is of interest to determine if S6K mediates TNF signaling related to insulin resistance. It is also important to determine the relationship between S6K and other serine kinases that are activated by TNF-α for insulin resistance. The association of IRS-1 Ser-636 phosphorylation with TNF-α treatment suggests a potential mechanism for S6K to mediate TNF signals for insulin resistance (7Gao Z. Zuberi A. Quon M. Dong Z. Ye J. J.

In the present study, we conducted a systematic analysis of the role of S6K in mediating TNF-α-induced insulin resistance. Our data suggest that TNF-α activates S6K through IKK2, and that S6K directly phosphorylates IRS-1 at four serine residues including Ser-265/270, Ser-302/307, Ser-632/636, and Ser-1097/1101 in rodents/humans. The Ser-265/270 is required for S6K to phosphorylate IRS-1 at other three serines.

Rapamycin (A-275), LY294002 (ST420), and SP600125 (EI-305) were acquired from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). 15-Deoxyprostaglandin J2 (15dPGJ2, 538927), PD98059 (513000), and SB203580 (203580) were purchased from Calbiochem. Wortmannin (W-1628), Type II collagenase (C6885), and TNF-α (T6674) were from Sigma. Purified p70S6 kinase (T412E), active IKK2 (IKKβ), and PKCθ were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Generation of Adenovirus—Adenovirus carrying a dominant negative S6K1 (S6K-DN) was constructed using ViraPower Adenoviral Expression System (K4930-00), which was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, S6K1-DN cDNA with HA tag was inserted into TOPO pENTR vector (K2400-20) and was recombined into the adenovirus expression plasmid pAd/CMV/V5-DEST. The pAd/CMV/V5-DEST plasmid with S6K1 cDNA was digested with the PacI endonuclease and transfected with 293A cells for production of adenovirus. The medium supernatant containing adenovirus was collected 3 days later and titrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting—Adipose tissue was homogenized in cold lysis buffer followed by sonication (6Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M.J. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Lysis buffer contains 1! Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 10! glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium metabisulfite, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cultured cells were kept in serum-free media overnight and treated with various reagents as indicated. After treatment, whole cell lysates were made in lysis buffer with sonication, and the supernatant was used for immunoblotting after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total protein (100 μg) in 50 μl of reducing sample buffer was used for immunoblotting as described previously (34Gao Z. He Q. Peng B. Chiao P.J. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4540-4547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were quantified using a scanning densitometer in conjunction with NIH ImageJ software. Signals were normalized to loading controls. Plasmids and Transfection—Expression vectors for HA-tagged IRS-1 wild type and IRS-1 S270A mutant were constructed in pCIS2 expression vector as described (11Ravichandran L.V. Esposito D.L. Chen J. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3543-3549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Plasmids for HA-S6K1 WT (8984) and HA-S6K1 dominant negative (8985) were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) (35Schalm S.S. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The plasmids for HA-IKK2 WT, HA-IKK2 kinase dead mutant, and GST-IRS-1 were described previously (6Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M.J. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells by transient transfection using Lipofectamine. Purified GST-IRS-1 was described previously (6Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M.J. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was carried out using whole cell lysates (400 μg of total protein), 2–4 μgof antibody, and 20 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After treatment, cell lysates were prepared by sonication in cell lysis buffer. IP was conducted by incubating the whole cell lysate with antibody for 3–4 h at 4 °C. The immune complex was washed five times in cell lysis buffer before being used for immunoblotting or kinase assays. Kinase Assay—For each in vitro kinase assay, purified GST-IRS-1 or HA-IRS-1 protein was used as substrate. The proteins were diluted in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm creatine phosphate). The kinase assay was conducted at 37 °C for 30 min in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer and 0.2 μg (2 μl) of kinase, such as S6K1, IKK2 (IKKβ), or PKCθ. The product was resolved by 8! SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with phosphospecific IRS-1 antibodies. RNA Interference—Mouse S6K-specific shRNA was expressed in retroviral silencing plasmids. The shRNA plasmids were made under a contract service agreement with Origene (Rockville, MD). Expression vectors for four independent shRNA were cotransfected into NIH-3T3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Empty vector was used as a negative control. 60 h after transfection, cells were kept in serum-free medium overnight and then stimulated without or with TNF-α or insulin for 30 min. Primary Adipocytes—Preadipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads of C57BL/6J mice as described elsewhere (36Ye J. Gao Z. Yin J. He H. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E1118-E1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The tissue was digested with Type II collagenase, and single cells were plated in a 100-mm flask in normal culture medium. After 24 h, cells attached to the flask were used as preadipocytes. The preadipocytes were plated into a 6-well plates and differentiated into adipocytes in standard adipogenic mixture (5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 10 μm dexamethasone). Mature adipocytes were used at day 9 of differentiation. Insulin-induced Glucose Uptake—3T3-L1 preadipocytes (5 × 105/well) were differentiated into adipocytes in a 12-well plate, and used in the glucose uptake assay as described elsewhere (15Gao Z. Zhang X. Zuberi A. Hwang D. Quon M.J. Lefevre M. Ye J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2024-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In experiments using dominant negative mutant of S6K, the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were infected by the S6K-DN adenovirus for 24 h and glucose uptake was examined after an additional 24 h. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were repeated independently at least three times with consistent results. For most figures with immunoblots, a representative blot is shown for each experiment along with a bar graph representing the mean ± S.E. of multiple independent experiments determined by densitometric analysis normalized to appropriate controls. Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance was used as appropriate in statistical analyses of the data. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Association between Increased S6K Phosphorylation and Serine Phosphorylation of IRS-1 in ob/ob Mice—We hypothesized that S6K1 participates in the TNF-α-induced insulin resistance of obesity. Therefore, we first examined the relationship between S6K1 phosphorylation at Thr-389 (a proxy for S6K1 activity) and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in adipose tissue from ob/ob mice (Fig. 1). As expected, phosphorylation of S6K1 was significantly elevated in adipose tissue from ob/ob mice when compared with samples from lean control mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Expression levels for S6K1 protein were comparable between lean and ob/ob mice. However, expression of IRS-1 protein was decreased in adipose tissue from ob/ob mice (Fig. 1, A and B). In several independent studies, S6K is reported to be involved with phosphorylation of IRS-1 at multiple serine residues including Ser-302/307, Ser-632/636, Ser-1097/1101, and Ser-307/312 in the mouse/human IRS-1 proteins (17Ozes O.N.

Each abbreviation for serines stands for the two corresponding serines in rodent (Ser-302) and human (Ser-307) IRS-1. The abbreviations are used in the same way in rest of our study unless specified. These previously published studies did not compare all of these sites in the same experimental preparation. Therefore, using phosphospecific antibodies, we demonstrated that serine phosphorylation at all of these sites was elevated in IRS-1 in adipose tissue from ob/ob mice when compared with samples from lean control mice (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, we evaluated serine phosphorylation of Ser-265/270 (Fig. 1, C and D) because the amino acid sequence surrounding this site is homologous to known S6K phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, Ser-265/270 phosphorylation was also increased in the samples from ob/ob mice. Thus, increased S6K phosphorylation in adipose tissue from ob/ob mice is associated with increased phosphorylation of IRS-1 at multiple serine residues as well as diminished protein expression of IRS-1. This raises the possibility that S6K may be directly phosphorylating IRS-1 at these 5 serine residues resulting in accelerated degradation of IRS-1. Role of S6K in Mediating TNF-induced Insulin Resistance—To evaluate the potential role of S6K in mediating TNF-α-induced insulin resistance, we first examined the ability of TNF-α to stimulate phosphorylation of S6K at Thr-389 and IRS-1 at Ser-265/270 (Fig. 2A). In both primary adipocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, TNF-α stimulated a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of S6K at Thr-389 and IRS-1 at Ser-265/270. Similarly in rat hepatoma cells (H4IIE), S6K1 phosphorylation was induced by TNF-α as early as 10 min (Fig. 2B). Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 was also increased in response to TNF-α in a time-dependent manner that seemed some 20–60 min later than the S6K phosphorylation. This difference in time course between S6K1 and Akt activation in response to TNF-α suggests that S6K1 activation may be independent of Akt. However, it should be noted that the sensitivity of the phospho-antibodies used against different proteins may not be similar. Thus, firm conclusions regarding relative time courses of phosphorylation for different proteins are not warranted based on these data alone. In these experiments, we also assessed IkBα degradation as a control for TNF-α activity (Fig. 2B). We next evaluated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes without or with pretreatment with TNF-α in the absence or presence of expression of a dominant negative mutant of S6K (S6K-DN) (Fig. 2C). As expected, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly impaired when cells were pretreated with TNF-α. Importantly, the effect of TNF-α to cause this insulin resistance was substantially blunted in cells expressing S6K-DN. Moreover, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt (Thr-308), a key mediator of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (37Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was also significantly diminished by TNF-α pretreatment (p < 0.001) and this effect of TNF-α was significantly abrogated by expression of S6K-DN (p < 0.02) (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results suggest that S6K plays a key role in mediating impairment in metabolic insulin signaling caused by TNF-α that contributes to insulin resistance. Identification of IRS-1 Ser-265/270 as a Novel Phosphorylation Site for S6K1—To identify novel serine phosphorylation sites on IRS-1 for S6K1, we compared an amino acid motif surrounding the phosphorylation site on S6, an authentic substrate of S6K1, with the whole IRS-1 amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A). The S6 motif is characterized by the sequence RXRXXS, in which the distal serine residue is the kinase target. We identified similar motifs in four of the IRS-1 phosphoserine sites evaluated in our present study (Ser-265/270, Ser-302/307, Ser-632/636, and Ser-1097/1101). This motif was not present for Ser-307/312 (Fig. 3A). We next evaluated the ability of S6K1 to directly phosphorylate IRS-1 by conducting in vitro kinase assays with purified S6K1 and recombinant HA-tagged IRS-1 (human IRS-1) immunoprecipitated from transfected 293 cells (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of IRS-1 was detected with phosphospecific antibodies as in Fig. 1B. Using this method, we found that S6K1 directly phosphorylated Ser-265/270, Ser-302/307, Ser-632/636, and Ser-1097/1101 in IRS-1. Interestingly, specific phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-307/312 by S6K1 was not observed. These results are consistent with our sequence analysis (Fig. 3A) and support the specificity of our in vitro kinase assay. Thus, we have identified Ser-265/270 as a novel S6K1 target in the IRS-1 protein. Our observations are unlikely to result from nonspecific interaction between S6K1 and IRS-1 since Ser-307/312 phosphorylation was not induced by S6K under identical assay conditions. Regulatory Role for Phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-265/270 by S6K1—Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 at multiple sites has been implicated in inhibition of insulin signaling. It is possible that phosphorylation of IRS-1 at one serine residue may regulate the ability of S6K1 to phosphorylate other sites on IRS-1. To evaluate this possibility, we substituted Ser-270 with alanine in the human IRS-1 protein (S270A mutant). This serine site was selected for further investigation because it represents a novel phosphorylation target"
https://openalex.org/W2065164168,"The ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery is required for the scission of membrane necks in processes including the budding of HIV-1 and cytokinesis. An essential step in cytokinesis is recruitment of the ESCRT-I complex and the ESCRT-associated protein ALIX to the midbody (the structure that tethers two daughter cells) by the protein CEP55. Biochemical experiments show that peptides from ALIX and the ESCRT-I subunit TSG101 compete for binding to the ESCRT and ALIX-binding region (EABR) of CEP55. We solved the crystal structure of EABR bound to an ALIX peptide at a resolution of 2.0 angstroms. The structure shows that EABR forms an aberrant dimeric parallel coiled coil. Bulky and charged residues at the interface of the two central heptad repeats create asymmetry and a single binding site for an ALIX or TSG101 peptide. Both ALIX and ESCRT-I are required for cytokinesis, which suggests that multiple CEP55 dimers are required for function."

Immobilization on chromatin of both CB structural components, such as coilin, and functional components of the CB, such as the SMN complex, spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), small nucleolar RNPs, and small Cajal body–specific RNPs, is sufficient for the formation of a morphologically normal and apparently functional CB. Biogenesis of the CB does not follow a hierarchical assembly pathway and exhibits hallmarks of a self-organizing structure."

The extension of similar studies to more distant stars has raised many difficulties despite the strong efforts of the international community over the past decades. The CoRoT (Convection Rotation and Planetary Transits) satellite, launched in December 2006, has now measured oscillations and the stellar granulation signature in three main sequence stars that are noticeably hotter than the sun. The oscillation amplitudes are about 1.5 times as large as those in the Sun; the stellar granulation is up to three times as high. The stellar amplitudes are about 25% below the theoretic values, providing a measurement of the nonadiabaticity of the process ruling the oscillations in the outer layers of the stars."

We also observed a rotary action in the suspended supercooled drop driven by repetitive transitions (a polyamorphic rotor) from which the reversible changes in molar volume (1.2 ± 0.2 cubic centimeters) and entropy (19 ± 4 joules mole –1 kelvin –1 ) can be estimated."

Hiraga S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4784-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). But the subsequent discovery of TA genes in the chromosomes of numerous diverse prokaryotes suggests alternative functions for the chromosomal TA systems (2Gerdes K. Rasmussen P.B. Molin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3116-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). At least nine possible functions for chromosomal TA systems have been proposed, such as stabilization of genomic parasites, gene regulation, growth control, persistence, or programmed cell death (3Magnuson R.D. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6089-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) but the most probable hypothesis, supported by experimental evidence, is the cessation of growth under conditions of nutritional or environmental stress (4Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Indeed, a unifying feature of bacteria that contain TA operons is the propensity for dormancy or slow growth. For instance, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is able to arrest its growth during the intracellular phases of its lifecycle harbors 38 TA operons and Gloeobacter violaceus which grows slowly in the laboratory has 21 TA operons (5Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The primary function of these TA systems could be to arrest growth, and thus enable survival in unfavorable or stressful environments (6Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Lobner-Olesen A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of TA loci is not clearly understood, their mechanisms of action have been thoroughly studied. TA loci consist of two genes organized in an operon, which encode an unstable antitoxin and a stable toxin (7Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In favorable growth conditions, both proteins are expressed and the antitoxin sequesters the toxin in a complex allowing bacterial cell growth. In most cases, the complex and particularly the antitoxin act as a repressor of the operon transcription (8Christensen S.K. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mine N. Gottesman S. Gerdes K. Van Melderen L. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1705-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Under stress, such as oxidative stress, elevated temperature, starvation, or addition of antibiotic, specific proteases are triggered which degrade the unstable antitoxin more rapidly than the toxin (4Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This degradation leads to the release of the toxin in the cell. Most toxins are ribonucleases that cleave mRNA in a specific or nonspecific manner although some toxins have been determined to be inhibitors of gyrases and kinases (9Bahassi E.M. O'Dea M.H. Allali N. Messens J. Gellert M. Couturier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10936-10944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The action of the toxin permits the bacterium to enter a reversible bacteriostatic state which can ultimately cause bacterial cell death (4Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 6Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Lobner-Olesen A. Nat. Rev.

In most of these systems, toxins are homologues of the pilT N terminus domain (PIN domain), which are small proteins with structural homology to the T4 RNase H nuclease domain (13Arcus V.L. Rainey P.B. Turner S.J. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although sequence similarity is low within the PIN domains, multiple sequence alignments have shown that active site residues are highly conserved. These residues were first predicted in silico to have a nuclease activity which was then confirmed in vitro (14Arcus V.L. Backbro K. Roos A. Daniel E.L. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16471-16478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These results support a ribonuclease function for the toxins. Five TA families have been identified on the M. tuberculosis chromosome: one member from the higBA family, two from parDE (15Oberer M. Zangger K. Gruber K. Keller W. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 1676-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), three from relBE (16Gotfredsen M. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), nine from mazEF (17Engelberg-Kulka H. Hazan R. Amitai S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4327-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and 23 from vapBC (5Pandey D.P. Gerdes K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16471-16478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The E. coli MazEF and the archaeal RelBE systems have been extensively studied. In the first system, the MazE antitoxin inhibits the toxic action of MazF, which cleaves mRNA specifically at ACA sequences, by mimicking ssRNA (17Engelberg-Kulka H. Hazan R. Amitai S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4327-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex shows that the antitoxin is organized as a long α-helix that binds a deep cleft formed by the oligomeric MazF (18Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the second system, RelBE adopts a different strategy: the toxin, RelE, binds to the A-site of the ribosome and cleaves nascent mRNA. RelB inhibits the action of RelE by wrapping around the toxin, enlarging it, and thus precluding it from penetrating the ribosomal A-site (19Takagi H. Kakuta Y. Okada T. Yao M. Tanaka I. Kimura M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Here we present the first crystal structure of a prokaryotic VapBC complex, VapBC-5 from M. tuberculosis. The toxin, VapC-5, contains 126 residues (Mr = 14.0 kDa) and the antitoxin, VapB-5, contains 34 residues (Mr = 3.8 kDa). This structure provides insight into the modes of binding and inhibition of the toxin by the antitoxin and suggests that M. tuberculosis VapC-5 is an endoribonuclease. Coexpression Vector—The cloning strategy for coexpression of Rv0626, which encodes for VapB-5 and Rv0627, which encodes for VapC-5 was designed for LIC using the pET46 Ek/LIC vector kit and LIC DUET minimal adaptor (both from Novagen). Gene-specific PCR primers contained 5′ extensions so that T4 polymerase treatment of PCR products in the presence of dATP would generate overhangs complementary to either the 5′-or3′-end of the pET46-LIC vector or the LIC DUET minimal adaptor. The PCR primers were designed so that Rv0627 would be in the upstream (5′) position separated from Rv0626 in the downstream (3′) position by the 138-base pair LIC DUET minimal adaptor. The construct resulted in Rv0627 having an N-terminal extension (MAHHHHHHVDDDDK) encoding a histidine tag and an enterokinase site for proteolytic removal of the tag, and the adaptor adds the amino acid sequence MQAGPAL to the N terminus of Rv0626. Cloning of the Rv0626 and Rv0627 Genes—The Rv0626 and Rv0627 genes were PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using Sure-Pol DNA polymerase (Denville Scientific). The following primers pairs were used: Rv0627Fwd (5′-GACGACGACAAGATGGTGAGCACGACGCCGGCCGCCGG), Rv0627Rev (5′-CGCGGGCGGCCGTATTAGACCCGAATGATCTCCACACTGGCCGCACCG), Rv0626Fwd (5′-GCGGGCCCGGCCTTGATGTCTGAGGTGGCCTCGCGTGAGCTGCG), and Rv0626Rev (5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTATTACCGGATCGGCCCGAGATCCTCGGTCGTG). The PCR products were extracted from agarose gels using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and eluted with TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The products were then treated with T4 polymerase in the presence of dATP according to the protocol supplied with the pET46 Ek/LIC vector kit (Novagen). The LIC-treated PCR products were annealed to the pET46 Ek/LIC vector and LIC DUET minimal adaptor by following the LIC DUET Adaptor Kit protocol (Novagen). The annealed product was transformed into E. coli NovaBlue GigaSingles Competent Cells (Novagen); selection was for ampicillin resistance. Recombinant plasmids containing Rv0626/Rv0627 were isolated and sequenced (Davis Sequencing) to confirm the presence of the genes and adaptor. Protein Preparation—The plasmid harboring the two genes was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and cells were grown to an A600 of 0.3 in LB containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Protein expression was then induced using 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 25 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A) to which protease inhibitor mixture, RNase A, DNase I (Sigma), and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride were added. Cell lysis was performed by sonication on ice, and the lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The filtered supernatant was then applied to a HisTrap Ni2+-chelating column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A. The pure complex coeluted using a step gradient in 300 mm imidazole and was then concentrated to 6 mg/ml to screen for crystallization. To prepare the selenomethionyl (SeMet) derivative of VapBC-5, E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells were grown in 2 ml of LB containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin for 6 h, then spun down, resuspended in 35 ml of M9 medium, and grown at 37 °C overnight. This overnight culture was then used to innoculate 2 liters of M9 medium. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.15, solid amino acid supplements were added to the culture according to the protocol of Van Duyne et al. (20Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Protein expression and purification of SeMet protein followed the same protocol as described earlier for the native protein. Crystallization and Data Collection—Wild-type protein produced crystals in numerous conditions. The best diffracting crystal appeared in 30% MPD, 0.1 m sodium acetate pH 4.6, 0.2 m NaCl within 2 weeks. Crystals of the SeMet-substituted complex grew in 30% MPD, 0.1 m sodium acetate pH 4.2 after two months. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and native data were collected to 1.9-Å resolution at the Advanced Photon Source (24-ID-C, APS, IL) whereas selenium anomalous data were collected at Advanced Light Source Beamline (BL8-2-1, ALS, CA) (Table 1). All data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Experimental phases were improved by density modification using the program DM (24Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). The resulting phases coupled with the observed structure factors were then input into ARP/wARP (25Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

This assay uses a RNA substrate containing a fluorescent reporter molecule on one end and a quencher on the other. In the intact substrate, the quencher is physically close to the reporter and dampens its fluorescence signal to extremely low levels. When the RNA substrate is cleaved, the quencher is separated from the reporter, allowing it to emit a bright green signal when excited. The cleavage of the RNA substrate is measured at 520 nm after excitation at 490 nm every minute for three hours using a fluorimeter. Each experiment was set up in triplicate for measurement accuracy. The positive control consisted of 3 × 10-5 units of RNase A with substrate. Negative controls consisted of substrate incubated with buffer and nuclease-free water or substrate incubated with 3 × 10-5 units of RNase A and 40 units of the RNase inhibitor RNaseOUT™ (Invitrogen). Purified and concentrated M. tuberculosis VapBC-5 was incubated at 25 μm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl and containing either 10 mm MgCl2 or 10 mm EDTA with 15 pmol of the fluorescent substrate resuspended in 5 μl of 10× buffer (Ambion kit AM1964). Although the composition of the substrate resuspension buffer is not provided in details, the presence of detergents is mentioned. These experiments were repeated in the presence of RNaseOUT™ to eliminate any RNase contamination. For the in vitro ribonuclease assay, increasing amounts of the M. tuberculosis VapBC-5 complex (4, 8, 12, 16 μm) were incubated with 2 μm of a 150 nucleotide hairpin loop RNA in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, at 37 °C. Samples were also prepared in the same way using 10 mm MgCl2 instead of EDTA. Reactions were stopped after 5 h by the addition of gel-loading buffer (10 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5× TBE, 0.01% xylene cyanol) followed by heating at 90 °C for 3 min. Samples were run on a 15% polyacrylamide/urea denaturing gel and visualized using Sybr Green II RNA gel stain (Cambrex). Similar experiments using a 1:1 or 1:5 ratio of enzyme:dsDNA were set up using a 25-base pair DNA oligomer (data not shown). Structure of the VapBC Heterocomplex—The structure of VapC-5 from M. tuberculosis in complex with a C-terminal fragment of VapB-5 was determined at 1.9-Å resolution by single wavelength anomalous dispersion (Fig. 1A). SHELXD was able to determine the positions of two selenium sites out of six putative sites in the asymmetric unit. ARP/WARP automatically built a total of 121 of 153 residues. The remaining residues were built in Coot (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23004) Google Scholar) to provide the final model that was refined to Rwork and Rfree of 21.4 and 24.9%, respectively. The final model includes 56 water molecules, three Na+ ions, one molecule of β-mercaptoethanol, and one molecule of acetate. The geometry of the structure was checked using the Structure Analysis and VErification Server (SAVES), which integrates the programs PROCHECK, WHAT CHECK, ERRAT, VERIFY 3D, and PROVE. No residues were found in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The structure of M. tuberculosis VapC-5 toxin forms a compact α/β/α main domain and a protruding clip structure of two α-helices. These domains are built from 11 secondary structure elements (Fig. 1, A and C): β1 (residues 22–25), α1 (residues 28–31), α2 (residues 41–43), β2 (residues 47–51), α3 (residues 53–64), α4 (residues 68–84), α5 (residues 91–108), α6 (residues 113–126), β3 (residues 129–131), α7 (residues 137–141), β4 (residues 147–149). The compact core domain is organized as a four-stranded parallel β-sheet (β2-β1-β3-β4) surrounded by five α-helices. The clip structure protrudes from the core domain and consists of α-helices α3 and α4 linked by a short loop. These two domains are connected by two potentially flexible stretches of residues, which conceivably confer the necessary flexibility to bind the antitoxin. The possibility of flexibility is suggested by the coil structure of these segments. Electron density for the 19 N-terminal residues (15 from the histidine tag and four from the native N terminus) is not visible in the structure of VapC-5 nor are the five residues in the loop linking helices α1 and α2 (Fig. 1, A and C). The structure of VapB-5 antitoxin shows clear electron density for 33 residues out of 93 (86 native and seven from the vector). The missing residues are part of the N-terminal region that is predicted to bind to DNA (29Wilbur J.S. Chivers P.T. Mattison K. Potter L. Brennan R.G. So M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12515-12524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). VapB-5 has an extended geometry organized in two α-helices, α1 (residues 58–65) and α2 (residues 72–82) connected by a long and potentially flexible loop (Fig. 1, A–C). The antitoxin binds tightly to VapC-5 in a deep and wide groove formed between the core domain and the clip structure (Fig. 1, A and B). The N-terminal residues of VapB-5, and in particular the side chain atoms of VapB-5 Arg-53, are wrapped around VapC-5 to fortify the interactions. These interactions involve hydrophobic residues to stabilize the N terminus of helix α1 of the antitoxin as well as the C-terminal of helix α2 of the antitoxin. The remaining interactions are direct hydrogen bonds between charged residues of the antitoxin and the toxin. The groove narrows around the loop linking the two α-helices of VapB-5 by the alternative conformation of the side-chain atoms of VapC-5 Gln-73 and residue VapC-5 Ala-32 main chain (Fig. 1B). Because the antitoxin fills the large otherwise exposed groove, the interface between VapB-5 and VapC-5 buries 558 Å2 which represents 30% of the accessible surface area of the antitoxin. In the crystal, VapBC-5 forms a dimer through the 2-fold axis that involves helix α3, the loop linking β3 to α5, the helix α5, the loop linking α5 to α6 and the N-terminal part of helix α6 from VapC-5 as well as the C-terminal part of helix α2 and the extended coil region of VapB-5 (residues 82–86). Geometry of the Putative Active Site Residues—As predicted from sequence alignment, the structure of M. tuberculosis VapC-5 belongs to the family of PIN domains (30Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R888-R890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This family of proteins groups homologs of the N-terminal domain of the pili biogenesis protein that are organized as two α-helices, four parallel β-sheets, followed by two α-helices. The alignment of multiple PIN domains with M. tuberculosis VapC-5 reveals four highly conserved acidic residues, VapC-5 Asp-26, VapC-5 Glu-57, VapC-5 Asp-115, and VapC-5 Asp-135 consistent with exonuclease activity. In fact, experimental results have shown that these residues are involved in a Mg2+-dependent exonuclease activity (14Arcus V.L. Backbro K. Roos A. Daniel E.L. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16471-16478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the structure of VapBC-5, these residues cluster to form a negatively charged cavity structured by residues from both VapB-5 and VapC-5 (Figs. 1B and 2). The acidic cavity is shaped by side chains (VapB-5 Arg-75, VapB-5 Leu-78, and VapB-5 Ala-82) from VapB-5 helix α-2 which restrains accessibility to the putative catalytic residues on top of the cavity. Residues from VapC-5 that link strand β-1 to helix α-1, helices α-5 to α-6, and strand β-4 to helix α-7 as well as residues from helix α-6 and the N-terminal part of helix α-1 also participate in the formation of the acidic cavity. The putative active site residues are tightly stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2). VapC-5 Glu-57 OE1 is stabilized by VapC-5 Thr-27 OG1 while VapC-5 Glu-57 OE2 accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide group NH1 of VapC-5 Arg-112 which also interacts with the main chain carbonyl of VapB-5 Ala-82. The VapC-5 Arg-112 NH2 donates a hydrogen bond to OD1 of VapC-5 Asp-115. A well-defined water interacts (31Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) with both VapC-5 Asp-115 OD1 and VapC-5 Asp-26 OD2. VapC-5 Asp-115 OD2 forms hydrogen bonds with a second water molecule. It is likely that VapC-5 Asp-115 OD2 is protonated given the short hydrogen bond (2.42 Å) formed with VapC-5 Asp135 OD2. VapC-5 Asp-26 OD1 interacts with both VapC-5 Ser-28 OG and its main chain amine group. VapC-5 Asp-135 OD2 is also stabilized by the main chain amide group of VapC-5 Arg-112 while its OD1 group forms a hydrogen bond with a third water molecule. A fourth water molecule stabilizes the main chain amide group of VapC-5 Asp-135, the main chain carbonyl of VapC-5 Asp-133 and VapC-5 Thr-131 OG1. This carbonyl atom also donates a hydrogen bond to VapC-5 Asp-26 OD2. OD1 and OD2 of VapC-5 Asp-133 are both stabilized by VapB-5 Arg-75, NH2 and NE, respectively. Structural Homologs—The overall structure of VapC-5 in the structure of the M. tuberculosis VapBC-5 superimposes well on the structure of VapC from Pyrobaculum aerophilum (1V8P, R.M.S.D. = 3.2 Å on 113 Cα, % identity = 24%) (14Arcus V.L. Backbro K. Roos A. Daniel E.L. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16471-16478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) except for helix α-2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Compared with Pae VapC helix α-2 in M. tuberculosis VapC-5 is shifted by about 10 Å and is broken into two one-turn helices linked by a flexible loop for which no electronic density is observed in VapC-5 in our complex. The position occupied by helix α-2 in Pae VapC is occupied by residues of the C-terminal helix of the antitoxin in the structure of M. tuberculosis VapBC-5. It is thus unlikely that the difference around helix α-2 is due to the presence of VapB-5 bound to VapC-5. That difference could reflect that Pyrobaculum aerophilum is an archaea whereas M. tuberculosis is a prokaryote. Searches with DALI (32Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) and DÉJÀ VU (33Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 525-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) using the VapC-5 structure as a probe found structural homologs of VapC-5 in PIN domain-containing proteins. The closest structural homolog is FitAB from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (% identityVapC-5/FitB = 21% and % identityVapB-5/FitA = 14%) for which the structure of the complex was determined with and without DNA bound to the N terminus of FitA (34Mattison K. Wilbur J.S. So M. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37942-37951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Superimposing VapC-5 on Ngo FitB shows the same deviation of helix α-2 compared with Pae VapC (Fig. 3C). Although the toxins superimpose well, Ngo FitA does not bind to the toxin in the same manner that M. tuberculosis VapB-5 binds VapC-5. Ngo FitA helix α-3 fills a large exposed hydrophobic groove on Ngo FitB while the C-terminal extended coil region of Ngo FitA binds to the positively charged part of the Ngo FitB groove. The extended coil region of Ngo FitA is organized as helix α-2 in the structure of M. tuberculosis VapBC-5 and the loop linking helices α-1 and α-2 is buried deeper in the VapC-5 groove. In their Ngo FitAB structure, the authors propose that Ngo FitA inhibits Ngo FitB by pointing the guanidinium group of Ngo FitA Arg-68, at the C-terminal extended coil region, to the carboxyl groups of the putative catalytic residues Ngo FitB Asp-5, Ngo FitB Glu-42 and Ngo FitB Asp-104. Although this Ngo FitA Arg-68 is not conserved in the primary amino acid sequence of M. tuberculosis VapB-5, structural superimposition shows that VapC-5 Arg-112 from M. tuberculosis VapC-5 itself points toward the carboxylic groups of the putative catalytic residues as seen in the structure of Ngo FitAB (Fig. 3D). This VapC-5 Arg-112 is tightly held in position by a hydrogen bond accepted by the main chain carbonyl of residue VapB-5 Ala-82 and thus may participate in the mechanism of inhibition of the toxin. Structural comparisons also identified the endo and exonuclease FEN-1 as a member of the PIN domain superfamily (14Arcus V.L. Backbro K. Roos A. Daniel E.L. Baker E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16471-16478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although the structural alignment gave poor statistics (R.M.S.D. of 2.25 Å on 102 equivalent positions with 6.5% sequence identity), the active site residues superimpose well. Moreover the structure of FEN-1 displays two Mg2+ ions bound to the active site residues that allow the identification of the putative Mg2+ binding sites in VapC-5 (Fig. 3E).

https://openalex.org/W2036247550,"Determining the atomic structures of oxide surfaces is critical for understanding their physical and chemical properties but also challenging because the breaking of atomic bonds in the formation of the surface termination can involve complex reconstructions. We used advanced transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the atomic structure of reduced titania (TiO 2 ) (110) surfaces from directions parallel to the surface. In our direct atomic-resolution images, reconstructed titanium atoms at the top surface layer are clearly imaged and are found to occupy the interstitial sites of the TiO 2 structure. Combining observations from two orthogonal directions, the three-dimensional positioning of the Ti interstitials is identified at atomic dimensions and allows a resolution of two previous models that differ in their oxygen stoichiometries."
https://openalex.org/W2144770187,"Heterochromatin formation at fission yeast centromeres is directed by RNA interference (RNAi). Noncoding transcripts derived from centromeric repeats are processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that direct the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) effector complex to engage centromere transcripts, resulting in recruitment of the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase Clr4, and hence silencing. We have found that defects in specific splicing factors, but not splicing itself, affect the generation of centromeric siRNAs and consequently centromeric heterochromatin integrity. Moreover, splicing factors physically associate with Cid12, a component of the RNAi machinery, and with centromeric chromatin, consistent with a direct role in RNAi. We propose that spliceosomal complexes provide a platform for siRNA generation and hence facilitate effective centromere repeat silencing."

https://openalex.org/W1965232435,"This study aimed to further elucidate the function of Roundabout proteins in endothelium. We show that both Robo1 and Robo4 are present in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and have knocked expression down using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. Roundabout knockout endothelial cells were then studied in a variety of in vitro assays. We also performed a yeast 2-hybrid analysis using the intracellular domain of Robo4 as bait to identify interacting proteins and downstream signaling. Both Robo1 and Robo4 siRNA knockdown and transfection of Robo4-green fluorescent protein inhibited endothelial cell movement and disrupted tube formation on Matrigel. Consistent with a role in regulating cell movement, yeast 2-hybrid and glutathione-S-transferase pulldown analyses show Robo4 binding to a Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, and WASP-interacting protein actin-nucleating complex. We have further shown that Robo1 forms a heterodimeric complex with Robo4, and that transfection of Robo4GFP into HUVECs induces filopodia formation. We finally show using Robo1 knockdown cells that Robo1 is essential for Robo4-mediated filopodia induction. Our results favor a model whereby Slit2 binding to a Robo1/Robo4 heterodimer activates actin nucleation-promoting factors to promote endothelial cell migration.—Sheldon, H., Andre, M., Legg, J.

https://openalex.org/W1987147367,"Structural studies of the T7 bacteriophage DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) have shown that the conformation of the amino-terminal domain changes substantially between the initiation and elongation phases of transcription, but how this transition is achieved remains unclear. We report crystal structures of T7 RNAP bound to promoter DNA containing either a 7- or an 8-nucleotide (nt) RNA transcript that illuminate intermediate states along the transition pathway. The amino-terminal domain comprises the C-helix subdomain and the promoter binding domain (PBD), which consists of two segments separated by subdomain H. The structures of the intermediate complex reveal that the PBD and the bound promoter rotate by ∼45° upon synthesis of an 8-nt RNA transcript. This allows the promoter contacts to be maintained while the active site is expanded to accommodate a growing heteroduplex. The C-helix subdomain moves modestly toward its elongation conformation, whereas subdomain H remains in its initiation- rather than its elongation-phase location, more than 70 angstroms away."
https://openalex.org/W2011312947,"Galaxies are complex systems the evolution of which apparently results from the interplay of dynamics, star formation, chemical enrichment, and feedback from supernova explosions and supermassive black holes. The hierarchical theory of galaxy formation holds that galaxies are assembled from smaller pieces, through numerous mergers of cold dark matter. The properties of an individual galaxy should be controlled by six independent parameters including mass, angular-momentum, baryon-fraction, age and size, as well as by the accidents of its recent haphazard merger history. Here we report that a sample of galaxies that were first detected through their neutral hydrogen radio-frequency emission, and are thus free of optical selection effects, shows five independent correlations among six independent observables, despite having a wide range of properties. This implies that the structure of these galaxies must be controlled by a single parameter, although we cannot identify this parameter from our dataset. Such a degree of organisation appears to be at odds with hierarchical galaxy formation, a central tenet of the cold dark matter paradigm in cosmology."
https://openalex.org/W2016878020,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a vital angiogenic effector, regulating key angiogenic processes. Vascular development relies on numerous signaling pathways, of which those induced by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) are critical. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is emerging as necessary for vascular development. Although VEGF, TGFβ, and Wnt signal transductions are well studied individually, it has not been demonstrated previously that all three can interact or be dependent on each other. We show that regulation of VEGF by TGFβ<sub>1</sub>, in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), depends on a direct interaction between TGFβ signaling proteins, Smads, and members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling family. VEGF promoter reporter constructs identified a region of the VEGF promoter containing two T cell factor (TCF)-binding sites as necessary for TGFβ<sub>1</sub>-induced VEGF transcription. Mutation of TCF sites and expression of dominant negative TCF4 abolished TGFβ<sub>1</sub>-induced VEGF promoter activity. Studies in Smad2 and Smad3 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that one or both are required for VEGF regulation by TGFβ<sub>1</sub>, with transfection of dominant negative Smad2 or Smad3 into PASMCs confirming this. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed <i>in cell</i> interactions of Smad2 and Smad3 with TCF4 and β-catenin at the VEGF promoter, whereas co-immunoprecipitation showed a direct physical interaction between Smad2 and β-catenin in the nucleus of PASMCs. Finally, we demonstrate that TGFβ<sub>1</sub> regulates TCF by modifying β-catenin phosphorylation via regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. These results provide new insight into the molecular regulation of VEGF by two interacting pathways necessary for vascular development, maintenance, and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2048729049,"Elementary triatomic reactions offer a compelling test of our understanding of the extent of electron-nuclear coupling in chemical reactions, which is neglected in the widely applied Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. The BO approximation predicts that in reactions between chlorine (Cl) atoms and molecular hydrogen, the excited spin-orbit state (Cl*) should not participate to a notable extent. We report molecular beam experiments, based on hydrogen-atom Rydberg tagging detection, that reveal only a minor role of Cl*. These results are in excellent agreement with fully quantum-reactive scattering calculations based on two sets of ab initio potential energy surfaces. This study resolves a previous disagreement between theory and experiment and confirms our ability to simulate accurately chemical reactions on multiple potential energy surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2031020964,"During spindle assembly, chromosomes generate gradients of microtubule stabilization through a reaction-diffusion process, but how this is achieved is not well understood. We measured the spatial distribution of microtubule aster asymmetry around chromosomes by incubating centrosomes and micropatterned chromatin patches in frog egg extracts. We then screened for microtubule stabilization gradient shapes that would generate such spatial distributions with the use of computer simulations. Only a long-range, sharply decaying microtubule stabilization gradient could generate aster asymmetries fitting the experimental data. We propose a reaction-diffusion model that combines the chromosome generated Ran-guanosine triphosphate-Importin reaction network to a secondary phosphorylation network as a potential mechanism for the generation of such gradients."

The Terrain Camera (TC), a 10-meter-resolution stereo camera onboard the Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) spacecraft, succeeded in imaging the inside of the crater, which was faintly lit by sunlight scattered from the upper inner wall near the rim. The estimated temperature of the crater floor, based on the crater shape model derived from the TC data, is less than approximately 90 kelvin, cold enough to hold water-ice. However, at the TC's spatial resolution, the derived albedo indicates that exposed relatively pure water-ice deposits are not on the crater floor. Water-ice may be disseminated and mixed with soil over a small percentage of the area or may not exist at all."
https://openalex.org/W2047124316,"Senescence is a potential tumor-suppressing mechanism and a commonly used model of cellular aging. One current hypothesis to explain senescence, based in part on the correlation of oxygen with senescence, postulates that it is caused by oxidative damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we further test this theory by determining the mechanisms of hyperoxia-induced senescence. Exposure to 70% O(2) led to stress-induced, telomere-independent senescence. Although hyperoxia elevated mitochondrial ROS production, overexpression of antioxidant proteins was not sufficient to prevent hyperoxia-induced senescence. Hyperoxia activated AMPK; however, overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of LKB1, which prevented AMPK activation, did not prevent hyperoxia-induced senescence. Knocking down p21 via shRNA, or suppression of the p16/pRb pathway by either BMI1 or HPV16-E7 overexpression, was also insufficient to prevent hyperoxia-induced senescence. However, suppressing p53 function resulted in partial rescue from senescence, suggesting that hyperoxia-induced senescence involves p53. Suppressing both the p53 and pRb pathways resulted in almost complete protection, indicating that both pathways cooperate in hyperoxia-induced senescence. Collectively, these results indicate a ROS-independent but p53/pRb-dependent senescence mechanism during hyperoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2070444363,"The development of queen and worker phenotypes in ants has been believed to be largely determined from environmental effects. We provide evidence that the production of discrete phenotypes is also influenced by genetic interaction effects. During the development of eggs into adults, some patrilines among offspring of multiply mated Pogonomyrmex rugosus ant queens became more common in workers while others became overrepresented in queens. Controlled crosses showed that these changes stem from some parental genome combinations being compatible for producing one phenotype but less compatible for the other. Genetic interaction effects on caste may be maintained over evolutionary time because the fitness of an allele depends on its genetic background."

The previous data show that MLC2 interacts with a novel human gene, myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (MR-1). Here, we reported that MR-1 was specially overexpressed in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Transient treatment of cells with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against MR-1 or stable transfection of cells with plasmid expressing MR-1-siRNA led to inhibitions of cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion. Following down-regulation of MR-1, the phosphorylations of MLC2, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and Akt were dramatically decreased, and the formation of stress fiber was destroyed by MR-1-siRNAs in hepatoma HepG2 cells. In addition, exogenous MR-1-induced as well as inherent phosphorylations of FAK and Akt were decreased by MLC kinase (MLCK) inhibitor, and F-actin polymerization inhibitor also decreased phosphorylations of FAK and Akt.

Previously, we have identified a novel human gene, MR-1, from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (GenBank™ accession number AF417001) (17Li T.B. Liu X.H. Feng S. Hu Y. Yang W.X. Han Y. Wang Y.G. Gong L.M. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2004; 36: 412-418Crossref Google Scholar). MR-1 is located on human chromosome 2q35 (GenBank accession number AC021016), and there are three alternatively spliced forms of MR-1 encoding three isoforms (18Liu X.H. Li T. Sun S. Xu F.F. Wang Y.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H279-H285Google Scholar). MR-1 is composed of three distinct exons, in which exon 3 is unique when compared with other two genes, and encodes a 142-amino acid protein with a hydrophobic transmembrane structure between amino acids 75 and 92. Yeast two-hybrid screening and in vitro GST pulldown revealed that MR-1 protein interacts with three proteins involved in muscle contraction such as MLC2 (17Li T.B. Liu X.H. Feng S. Hu Y. Yang W.X. Han Y. Wang Y.G. Gong L.M. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2004; 36: 412-418Crossref Google Scholar), indicating that MR-1 might be associated with cell migration and growth process through MLC2. In this study, we investigated whether MR-1 was related to the proliferation and migration of human cancer cells. We observed that MR-1 was overexpressed in human cancer cells. Our data demonstrated for the first time that the inhibitions of proliferation, migration, and adhesion of hepatoma HepG2 cells by siRNA against MR-1 were associated with the interdiction of MLC2/FAK/Akt signaling pathway. SiRNA Preparation and Treatment—21-Nucleotide siRNAs were synthesized by Ribo Technology Company (Beijing, China) using 2′-ACE protection chemistry. Two siRNA sequences targeting MR-1 were 5′-ACC GUG UGA AGC AGA UGA AdTdT-3′ and 5′-CCU AGG CUA UUG ACU GUU AdTdT-3′, and the mock siRNA sequence was 5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UdTdT-3′. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were cultured in the MEM-EBSS medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 10! heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5! CO2. At 24 h before transfection at 50–80! confluence, HepG2 cells were trypsinized and diluted to appropriated concentration with fresh medium without antibiotics. Transfection of siRNA was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For drug treatment, HepG2 cells were treated with MLCK inhibitor ML-7 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) or F-actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D (Sigma) for 24 h. Construction of siRNA-expressing and MR-1-expressing Plasmid—The DNA sequence to knock down expression of MR-1 was 5′-CCT AGG CTA TTG ACT GTT A TTCAAGAGA TAA CAG TCA ATA GCC TAG G-3′, and the mock sequence was 5′-TTC TCC GAA CGT GTC ACG T TTCAAGAGA ACG TGA CAC GTT CGG AGA A-3′. pCD-shRNA was reconstructed from pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen) in our laboratory, in which cytomegalovirus promoter was cut off and replaced with H1 promoter producing the transcription of siRNA. The above mentioned DNA sequences were ligated into pCD-shRNA to form plasmid pCD-MR-1 and plasmid pCD-mock. The MR-1 cDNA encoding MR-1 was amplified by PCR from mRNA and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen) to form plasmid pcDNA3.1-MR-1. Transfection and Selection of Stably Transfected HepG2/MR-1- Cells—HepG2 cells at 70–80! confluence were transfected with 2 μg of pCD-MR-1, pCD-mock, pcDNA3.1-MR-1, and pcDNA3.1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For stable transfection, the cells were exposed to 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) after 1 day of transfection. After growth for 3 weeks, cells were plated at a lower density in MEM-EBSS with 250 μg/ml G418 and 10! fetal bovine serum in 96-well plates until a single colony was formed. Single cloned cells named HepG2/MR-1--sc and HepG2/mock-sc cells were isolated and grown up. In addition, mix cloned populations named HepG2/MR-1--mc were also cultured for experiments. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to test for MR-1 level of HepG2/MR-1-. Western Blot—Whole cell lysates were used for immunoblotting as described previously (19Liu T.G. Yin J.Q. Shang B.Y. Min Z. He H.W. Jiang J.M. Chen F. Zhen Y.S. Shao R.G. Cancer Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 748-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). β-Actin was used as loading control. Anti-MR-1 polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Tianbo Li (Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Beijing, China). Other antibodies were anti-FAK, anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr-925), anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt (Tyr-473), anti-MLC2 and anti-phospho-MLC2 (Ser-19) (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Electrochemiluminescence was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with ChemiImager 5500 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Co.). RT-PCR Analysis—Total mRNA was extracted from the cells by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) with an extra step of acid phenol extraction. RT-PCR was carried out using a SuperScript™ one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) as described previously (19Liu T.G. Yin J.Q. Shang B.Y. Min Z. He H.W. Jiang J.M. Chen F. Zhen Y.S. Shao R.G. Cancer Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 748-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: MR-1 P1, 5′-TAT CCT CCT CTT CAT CCT CAC C-3′; MR-1 P2, 5′-AGG CAC GAA CTG GAA TCT GG-3′; GAPDH P1, 5′-CGG AGT CAA CGG ATT TGG TCG TAT-3′; GAPDH P2, 5′-GTC TTC ACC ACC ATG GAG AAG GCT-3′; β-actin P1, 5′-CCC AGG CAC CAG GGC GTG ATG GT-3′; β-actin P2, 5′-GGA CTC CAT GCC CAG GAA GGA A-3′. GAPDH and β-actin mRNA was analyzed as internal control. A measure of 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to synthesize cDNA at 50 °C for 30 min, and then the cDNA was subjected to PCR amplification with specific primers in 25-μl mixtures. PCR comprised 30 cycles with denaturing at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 40 s in each cycle using an MJ PCR system (Bio-Rad). The PCR products were then subjected to 2! agarose gel electrophoresis. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using specific sense and antisense primers in a 25-μl reaction volume containing 12.5 μl of Absolute™ QPCR SYBR Green mix (Invitrogen), 0.25 pmol of each primer, and 0.5 μg of mRNA. Oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: for MR-1 P1, 5′-caa cac ggg cga gta tga ga-3′; MR-1 P2, 5′-ctg ggc caa acc tga gga c-3′; CLCA1 P1, 5′-TCA TCA GGA AAT GGA GCT GTC-3′; CLCA1 P2, 5′-TCA TCA GGA AAT GGA GCT GTC-3′; KIAA1486 P1, 5′-GCT GAG CAC CTC ATC AGA GAC-3′; KIAA1486 P2, 5′-GGG TCT TGG TTT AGC TGA CG-3′; IMMT P1, 5′-GGA TAT AAA TAC TGC CTA TGC CAG A-3′; IMMT P2 5′-CTT CCT CTT CAG CAA CTG CAT-3′. The amplification number of cycles was 40, and the reaction took place for 3 min at 50 °C, 15 s at 95 °C, and 30 s at 63 °C, with an initial step of 95 °C for 3 min. Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration was measured as the ability of cells to migrate through a Transwell filter (8-μm pores, Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cells suspended in serum-free MEM-EBSS containing 0.1! bovine serum albumin were applied to the upper chamber. MEM-EBSS containing 20! fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml fibronectin (FN) was added to the lower chamber. After the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, cells that migrated to the lower side of the upper chamber were stained with hemotoxylin, and the number of cells per microscopic field (×300) was counted under microscope. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cells were washed in serum-free MEM-EBSS containing 0.2! trypsin inhibitor and resuspended in culture medium. 100 μl of suspended cells was added to each well of 96-well plates coated with 10 μg/ml FN and blocked with 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The plates were incubated for the appropriate periods of time at 37 °C in CO2 incubator. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and attached cells were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was processed as described previously (20Masuda T. Wada K. Nakajima A. Okura M. Kudo C. Kadowaki T. Kogo M. Kamisaki Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 4012-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For Western blot assay, cells were allowed to adhere to FN-coated plates for 2 h, and then proteins were collected. Analysis of Cell Spreading Morphology—Cells were suspended for 1 h in serum-free MEM-EBSS containing 1! bovine serum albumin and then replanted on 10 μg/ml FN (Merck)-coated 96-well plates. Cells were allowed to spread for the indicated times at 37 °C and then photographed using a Nikon upright scope equipped with a camera. F-actin Cytoskeleton Organization Detection—Cells were planted in six-well plates on glass coverslips. After the indicated treatment, cells were fixed in 3.7! paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Fixed cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized by treatment with 0.5! Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, and then stained with 5 μg/ml rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Merck) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min in the dark. Pictures were taken with Nikon fluorescence microscope. Cell Proliferation and Tumorigenicity Assay—For cell proliferation assay, 1 ml of cells was seeded at a density of 1000/ml in 24-well plates with 10! fetal bovine serum medium. The medium was changed regularly. The cell number was counted every 24 h for 6 days. For tumorigenicity assay, various cells (5 × 106) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice. Bidimensional tumor measurements were made every 4 days, and the average of these measurements was used to calculate tumor volume. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the arithmetic mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overexpression of MR-1 in Human Cancer Cells—To examine whether MR-1 was particularly expressed in human cancer cells, we first measured mRNA levels of MR-1 by RT-PCR assay in various human cancer cell lines, including liver cancer (HepG2, SMMC-7721, and BEL-7402), breast cancer (MCF-7), colon cancer (HT-29 and HCT116), fibrosarcoma (HT1080), and lung cancer (A549, PG, and PAa) cells, and in normal human cell lines, including liver L02 cells, lung fibroblast 2BS cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, mRNA levels of MR-1 in human cancer cells were higher than in human normal cells, indicating that MR-1 might be an oncogene. Furthermore, a Western blot assay showed that protein levels of MR-1 were higher in hepatoma cells when compared with normal cells (Fig. 1B). Both mRNA and protein levels of MR-1 were superlatively high in hepatoma HepG2 cells. In the rest of this study, we chose hepatoma HepG2 cells to validate MR-1 as a therapeutic oncogene. Inhibition of Cell Proliferation by Down-regulation of MR-1—RNA interference technology has been successfully used to identify gene functions. To avoid the off-target effects, we designed and synthesized two siRNAs against MR-1, MR-1-siRNA-1 and MR-1-siRNA-2, to investigate the function of MR-1. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that transcription and expression of MR-1 in HepG2 cells were dramatically down-regulated by both MR-1-siRNAs after 36 h transfection. (Fig. 2A). In the next experiment, we found that following down-regulation of MR-1, the ability of cell growth was obviously decreased in MR-1 siRNA-treated cells when compared with control and mock siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, MR-1-siRNA-2 silence sequence were ligated into an expression plasmid to create an expressing MR-1-siRNA plasmid pCD-MR-1, and at the same time, a negative control plasmid pCD-mock was also created. Here, we investigated whether MR-1-siRNA-2 sequence expressed by pCD-MR-1 has off-target effects on the other genes. A BLAST search of MR-1-siRNA-2 sense chain and antisense chain in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) was performed. The results showed that there were two transcripts, chloride channel regulator (CLCA1) and KIAA1486, complementary to the MR-1-siRNA-2 sense chain with query coverage of 73!, and three transcripts of inner membrane protein, mitochondrial (IMMT) complementary to the MR-1-siRNA-2 antisense chain with query coverage of 63!. The real-time RT-PCR assay showed that mRNA level of MR-1 was significantly decreased after a 36-h treatment of MR-1-siRNA-2, whereas CLCA1, KIAA1486, and IMMT were no changed (Fig. 2C), indicating that MR-1-siRNA-2 was specific for MR-1 knockdown without off-target effects and was suitable for the following experiments. To generate HepG2/MR-1- cells with stable knockdown of MR-1, pCD-MR-1 and pCD-mock were stably transfected into HepG2 cells, respectively. RT-PCR and Western blot assays showed that transcription and expression of MR-1 were knocked down in both HepG2/MR-1--sc and HepG2/MR-1--mc cells (Fig. 2D). It was observed that the ability of cell proliferation was markedly reduced in HepG2/MR-1--sc. In addition, HepG2/MR-1--mc cells also showed decreased proliferation ability when compared with parental cells (Fig. 2E). These data suggested that MR-1 might play an essential role in cancer cell growth. Inhibition of Cell Migration, Adhesion, and Spreading by Down-regulation of MR-1—It is well known that contraction of the actin cytoskeleton through activation of myosin II exerts force to propel cells to move. The actin-myosin II interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of MLC2 at Ser-19 (4Wakatsuki T. Wysolmerski R.B. Elson E.L. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Based on the interaction of MR-1 and MLC2, we suppose that MR-1 probably affect cell migration. The results showed that MR-1-siRNA-1 and MR-1-siRNA-2 both significantly reduced the migration of HepG2 cells with inhibitory rate of 52.9 and 62.7! (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the ability of the migration of MR-1 knockdown HepG2/MR-1--sc and HepG2/MR-1--mc cells was retarded when compared with that of parental and mock cells with inhibitory rates of 56.6 and 39.5! (Fig. 3B). Cell adhesion and spreading on ECM is a key step in cell migration process. As the cells adhere and spread, they generate tractions and thereby migration on the substrate. As shown in Fig. 3C, the cell adhesion ability on FN was decreased in MR-1-siRNA-treated HepG2 cells. Similarly, HepG2/MR-1--sc and HepG2/MR-1--mc cells also partially lost adhesion ability (Fig. 3D). To test cell spreading efficiency, cells were plated on FN-coated cell culture dishes. A striking difference in the appearance of cell spreading on FN was observed between HepG2/MR-1--sc and parental cells. HepG2 and HepG2/mock-sc cells began to spread at 60 min and were normally flattened at 120 min, whereas HepG2/MR-1--sc cells exhibited a delayed spreading and a limited extension on FN (Fig. 3E). These results confirmed that MR-1 was important for cell migration, adhesion, and spreading. Phosphorylation of MLC2, FAK, Akt, and Stress Fiber Formation by MR-1—To clarify the mechanism of action of MR-1, we examined whether the phosphorylation of MLC2 at Ser-19 was affected by MR-1. As shown in Fig. 4A, after treatment of MR-1-siRNAs, MLC2 phosphorylation was reduced. It is known that phosphorylation of MLC2 controls myosin II activity (21Niggli V. Schmid M. Nievergelt A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and subsequent organization of the actin stress fibers (22Hakuma N. Kinoshita I. Shimizu Y. Yamazaki K. Yoshida K. Nishimura M. Dosaka-Akita H. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10776-10782Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was used to stain the cells for measurement of F-actin (23Yu D.H. Qu C.K. Henegariu O. Lu X. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21125-21131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The results of the fluorescent image in Fig. 4B showed abundances of organized stress fibers in control and mock siRNA-treated cells. By contrast, MR-1-siRNA-treated HepG2 cells displayed mass spots of F-actin staining and no organized stress fiber formation, and there were numerous microspikes at the cell periphery (Fig. 4B). The finding indicated that MR-1 could strengthen the formation of actin stress fibers. Based on the above results, we further detected phosphorylation of FAK, a key kinase in the formation of focal adhesions, which is dependent upon activation of myosin II (24Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). The data showed that the phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-925, representation of FAK activity, were both dramatically decreased in MR-1-siRNA-1-treated and MR-1-siRNA-2-treated cells (Fig. 4A), indicating the stimulating function of MR-1 on FAK activity. Our results also showed that Tyr-473 phosphorylation of Akt, a survival signaling factor activated by FAK (25Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), was decreased in MR-1-siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4A). At the same time, the levels of total MLC2, FAK, and Akt were kept invariable. As shown in Fig. 4C, the phosphorylations of FAK and Akt were dramatically down-regulated in the suspension cells. Cell adhesion on FN stimulated the phosphorylations of FAK and Akt, which were also significantly inhibited by MR-1-siRNA-1 and MR-1-siRNA-2. The levels of total FAK and Akt were kept invariable in various cells (Fig. 4C). These results showed that MLC2, FAK, and Akt might be involved in MR-1-regulated adhesion and migration. Initiation of MLC2-FAK-Akt Pathway by MR-1—To investigate the MR-1-mediated signaling pathway, we further tested the key molecules to be involved. The results showed that exogenous expression of MR-1 by transfection of pcDNA3.1-MR-1 enhanced phosphorylations of MLC2, FAK, and Akt, which were blocked by MLCK inhibitor ML-7. Here, MR-1 levels were not affected by ML-7 treatment, indicating that MLC2 was downstream of MR-1 and upstream of FAK and Akt (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, to test whether the formation of stress fibers stimulated the activation of FAK, we examined the activations of FAK and Akt using specifically the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D. Fig. 5B showed that the phosphorylations of FAK and Akt were inhibited by cytochalasin D. However, MLC2 phosphorylation was increased. These data indicated that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton was an essential upstream factor for FAK activation and subsequent Akt activation in the MR-1-mediated signaling pathway. In addition, exogenous MR-1 enhanced the migration ability of cells by 28.77!, which was blocked by ML-7 and cytochalasin D (Fig. 5C). This result also supported the fact that MLC2 and stress fibers functioned as key downstream factors of MR-1. In Vivo Reduction of HepG2/MR-1- Tumorigenicity—The above data raised a possibility that hepatoma HepG2/MR-1--sc was not easily formed and developed in the animal model. To validate this possibility, human hepatoma HepG2, HepG2/mock-sc and HepG2/MR-1--sc cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of athymic nude mice, and tumor volumes were measured. Tumor masses resected from mice on day 20 after injection are shown in Fig. 6A. After 4 days of tumor inoculation, hepatoma HepG2 and HepG2/mock-sc were formed and grew quickly (Fig. 6B). However, the tumorigenicity of HepG2/MR-1--sc was dramatically limited (Fig. 6B). On day 20, the average size of HepG2, HepG2/mock and HepG2/MR-1--sc was 1156, 885, and 103 mm3 respectively, and the percentage of growth inhibition was 91.1! when compared with HepG2. After the completion of human genome sequencing and significant advances in genomics and proteomics, discovering the oncogene for therapeutic intervention of cancer remains as a future challenge. The present study demonstrates that MR-1 may be a novel human oncogene overexpressed in human cancer cell lines (Fig. 1). In vitro study showed that the proliferation, migration, and adhesion of hepatoma HepG2 cells are strongly inhibited by down-regulation of MR-1 either stably or transiently, using RNA interference technology. Furthermore, in vivo study further proves that MR-1 is essential for tumorigenicity. These results suggest that MR-1 is a potential tumor biomarker and therapeutic target. Understanding the signaling molecules involved in MR-1 bioactivity is important for targeting therapeutic purposes. Previous data have shown that MR-1 protein interacts with MLC2 (17Li T.B. Liu X.H. Feng S. Hu Y. Yang W.X. Han Y. Wang Y.G. Gong L.M. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2004; 36: 412-418Crossref Google Scholar). Our data show that phosphorylation of MLC2 is significantly decreased by the inhibition of MR-1 expression and stimulated by exogenous MR-1 (Figs. 4A and 5A). Moreover, the effect of MR-1 on migration appears to be mediated by MLC2, based on the ability of the MLCK inhibitor ML-7 to block the stimulatory effect of exogenous MR-1 on HepG2 migration (Fig. 5A). Therefore, we identify MLC2 as a key mediator of MR-1 bioactivity. It has been known that phosphorylation of MLC2 controls the activity of myosin II, which has multiple functions in cells, including stimulation of cell motility as a key component of focal adhesion formation and stress fiber formation (24Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M.

https://openalex.org/W2135168051,"Mutations in the MID1 protein have been found in patients with Opitz BBB/G syndrome (OS), which is characterised by multiple malformations of the ventral midline. MID1 is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and, in association with the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), α4, provides ubiquitin ligase activity for the ubiquitin-specific modification of PP2A. Using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technology, we show here that MID1 is actively and bi-directionally transported along the microtubules, and that this movement is directly linked to its MAP kinase and PP2A-mediated phosphorylation status. Intact transport depends on both kinesins and dyneins and is inhibited upon colcemide treatments. MID1 proteins carrying missense mutations in the α4 binding domain still bind the microtubules but cannot be actively transported. Likewise, knock-down of the α4 protein, inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid and fostriecin or the simulation of permanent phosphorylation at Ser96 in MID1 stop the migration of MID1-GFP, while preserving its microtubule-association. In summary, our data uncover an unexpected and novel function for PP2A, its regulatory subunit α4 and PP2A/α4/mTOR signaling in the active transport of the MID1 ubiquitin ligase complex along the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, a failure in the microtubule directed transport of this protein complex would be an attractive mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of OS in patients with B-box1 mutations."

The Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels is involved in mediating fast synaptic transmission throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems (1Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P.

However, many other important residues in the immediate vicinity of the binding site have been identified. In a classic experiment on the Torpedo nAChR (a close homologue of the muscle subtype), Czajkowski and Karlin (5Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22603-22612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that a key aspartate (γAsp-174/δAsp-180) from the complementary binding subunit could come within 9 Å of the agonist binding site. Mutation of this residue severely impacted receptor function, leading to a proposal that the negative charge of this aspartate interacted with the positive charge of the agonist (6Czajkowski C.

Subsequently, however, both the crystal structure of acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP, a soluble protein homologous to the extracellular domain of the nAChR) (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) showed that this residue is positioned quite far from the agonist binding site (Fig. 1). Single-channel studies suggest that this residue is primarily important for ligand-induced channel gating rather than agonist binding (11Akk G. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Sine S.M. Shen X.M. Wang H.L. Ohno K. Lee W.Y. Tsujino A. Brengmann J. Bren N. Vajsar J. Engel A.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). γAsp-174/δAsp-180 is part of loop F, the most remote of the six loops originally proposed by Changeux and co-workers (1Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) to contribute to the agonist binding site. In the carbamylcholine-bound AChBP structure (13Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), a different F loop anionic residue, γGlu-176/δGlu-182 (AChBP Glu-163), is positioned near loop C of the agonist binding site (Fig. 1). Specifically, γGlu-176/δGlu-182 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the backbone N-H at αSer-191, which is located on the C loop between the aromatic binding box residue αTyr-190 and the vicinal disulfide formed by αCys-192 and αCys-193. Loop F is generally disordered in the AChBP and nAChR structures, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry on AChBP reveals that loop F and loop C are the most conformationally dynamic segments of the protein (14Shi J. Koeppe J.R. Komives E.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12170-12177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that agonist binding draws loop C inward, capping the aromatic binding pocket (13Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 311-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In contrast, crystal structures of AChBP with antagonists bound reveal that loop C pulled away from the agonist binding site (15Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Distinctions between antagonist- and agonist-induced motion have also been observed in loop F (16Hibbs R.E. Radic Z. Taylor P. Johnson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39708-39718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As such, many investigators favor a gating model involving a contraction of the agonist binding site around an agonist molecule that is largely mediated by movements in loops C and F, although little is known about the nature of the specific interactions involved in this systolic motion. In the present work, we evaluate several anionic residues in loop F and potential interactions with loop C. Using a combination of natural and unnatural mutagenesis, we find that, indeed, the backbone N-H of αSer-191 does make a hydrogen bond to a loop F residue. However, the partner is not the glutamate seen in the AChBP crystal structure. Instead, the aspartate (γAsp-174/δAsp-180) originally identified by Czajkowski and Karlin (5Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22603-22612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is the hydrogen-bonding partner.

Synthesis of 2,3-Dihydroxypropionate (α-Hydroxyserine, Sah)-tRNA—Glycerate calcium salt dihydrate (286 mg, 2.0 mmol) were measured into a 100-ml round-bottomed flask.

Side Chain and Backbone Mutagenesis—Conventional mutagenesis and unnatural mutagenesis, with the site of interest mutated to either an amber stop codon or a four-base frameshift codon (at αSer-191), were achieved by a standard Stratagene QuikChange protocol. Sequencing through both strands confirmed the presence of the desired mutation. Mouse muscle embryonic nAChR in the pAMV vector was used. All the mutations were made in the presence of a background transmembrane mutation (βL9′S) that lowers whole-cell EC50 (24Filatov G.N. White M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 379-384PubMed Google Scholar, 25Labarca C. Nowak M.W. Zhang H. Tang L. Deshpande P. Lester H.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In addition, the α-subunits contain a hemagglutinin epitope in the M3-M4 cytoplasmic loop for Western blot studies. Control experiments show that this epitope does not detectably alter EC50. mRNA was prepared by in vitro runoff transcription using the Ambion (Austin, TX) T7 mMessage mMachine kit. For conventional mutants, a total of 2.0–4.0 ng of mRNA was injected in a ratio of 2:1:1:1 of α:β:γ:δ. For suppression with unnatural amino and hydroxy acids, a total of 4.0 ng of mRNA was injected in an α:β:γ:δ subunit ratio of 10:1:1:1. Typically, 25 ng of tRNA was injected per oocyte along with mRNA in a ratio of 1:1 with a total volume of 50 nl/cell. As a negative control for suppression, truncated 74-nucleotide tRNA or truncated tRNA ligated to deoxycytosine adenosine was co-injected with mRNA in the same manner as fully charged tRNA. Data from experiments where currents from these negative controls were greater than 10! of the experimental were excluded. Frameshift suppression at αSer-191 was used for simultaneous incorporation of two unnatural residues (26Rodriguez E.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8650-8655Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—The function of mutant receptors was evaluated using two-electrode voltage clamp (see supplemental materials). Stage V–VI oocytes of Xenopus laevis were employed. Oocyte recordings were made 12–48 h after injection in two-electrode voltage clamp mode using the Opus-Xpress 6000A instrument (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Oocytes were superfused with a Ca2+-free ND96 solution at flow rates of 1 ml/min before application, 4 ml/min during drug application, and 3 ml/min during wash. Holding potential was -60 mV. Data were sampled at 125 Hz and filtered at 50 Hz. Drug applications were 15 s in duration. Acetylcholine chloride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich/RBI. Solutions ranging from 0.01 to 5000 μm were prepared in Ca2+-free ND96 from a 1 m stock solution. Dose-response data were obtained for a minimum of eight concentrations of agonists and for a minimum of five cells. Dose-response relations were fitted to the Hill equation to determine EC50 and Hill coefficient values. The dose-response relations of individual oocytes were examined and used to determine outliers. The reported EC50 values are from the curve fit of the averaged data. A Backbone Mutation at αSer-191 Has a Large Impact on Receptor Function—In the process of probing the backbone flexibility surrounding the nAChR binding box, we mutated αSer-191 to Sah. This produces an ester backbone linkage at this position, while preserving the side chain. Along with increasing backbone flexibility, this mutation removes the hydrogen bond-donating N-H group and replaces it with a non-hydrogen bond-donating O (Figs. 2 and 3). We have performed similar backbone mutations at several positions throughout the nAChR, and typically, the consequences are not dramatic (19Cashin A.L. Torrice M.M. McMenimen K.A. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27England P.M. Zhang Y. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Cell. 1999; 96: 89-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, at αSer-191, this subtle mutation leads to a 40-fold increase in EC50 (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). We also made alanine and Aah mutations at this site. The side chain mutation alone had minimal impact on receptor function, producing no shift in EC50. However, receptor function of the αS191Aah mutant was dramatically impaired relative to αS191Ala, confirming that the backbone, and not the side chain, at αSer-191 is important for receptor function.FIGURE 3Mutant cycle analysis for a backbone mutation at αSer-191 and a side chain mutation at γAsp-174/δAsp-180 with the equation for calculating the coupling energy.

Surprisingly, all mutations have minimal impact, suggesting no critical role for this residue. Another nearby loop F glutamate residue, γGlu-163169/δGlu-163175, was also evaluated. Again, no significant impact was seen. In sharp contrast, even the subtlest mutations at γAsp-174/δAsp-180 produce large effects upon receptor function, a result that others have also seen (5Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22603-22612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol.

We first studied asparagine, glutamate, and glutamine mutations at this site. The γD174E/δD180E mutant exhibits a modest ∼3-fold decrease in EC50. However, the γD174N/δD180N and γD174Q/δD180Q mutants produce substantial (>100-fold) changes to the EC50 (Fig. 2B and Table 1). Fundamentally, the results of these conventional mutations strongly implicate the side chain of γAsp-174/δAsp-180 in an electrostatic interaction, such as an ion pair or hydrogen bond. However, changing the side chain functionality from a carboxylate to an amide not only neutralizes the charge on the side chain, it also desymmetrizes it and introduces a potential hydrogen bond donor. To better understand the role of γAsp-174/δAsp-180, we incorporated two unnatural amino acids. Nha is an analogue of glutamate that contains a nitro (NO2) group, which is isosteric and isoelectronic to a carboxylate, but it has no charge and is a much weaker hydrogen bond acceptor (Fig. 2A). 6Although nitroalanine, the analogue of aspartate, would be ideal, it is not chemically compatible with the nonsense suppression methodology. Given that the mutation γD174E/δD180E produces a very modest EC50 shift and that γD174N/δD180N and γD174Q/δD180Q show similar effects on receptor function, the comparison of Nha with Glu can be considered meaningful. Incorporation of Nha at γAsp-174/δAsp-180 yields a slightly less dramatic effect than the γD174N/δD180N and γD174Q/δD180Q mutants, producing a 24-fold shift in EC50 relative to γD174E/δD180E (Fig. 2B). Thus, charge neutralization at this site significantly affects receptor function but cannot fully account for the EC50 shift seen in the γD174N/δD180N and γD174Q/δD180Q mutants. The second unnatural amino acid analogue incorporated at γAsp-174/δAsp-180 was Akp. Akp is isoelectronic to Asp but possesses a methyl ketone functionality in place of the carboxylate (Fig. 2A). As such, Akp is a desymmetrized analogue of Asp, similar to Asn, but it has different electrostatic properties (less polar, weaker hydrogen bond acceptor, and cannot donate a hydrogen bond). When Akp is incorporated at γAsp-174/δAsp-180, its effect upon receptor function is roughly as deleterious as the Asn mutation (Fig. 2B). Mutations at individual binding sites (αβγD174Nδ and αβγδD180N) showed substantial (∼50-fold) and approximately equivalent increases in whole cell EC50 (supplemental Table 1). Mutant Cycle Analysis Reveals a Strong Interaction between the αSer-191 Backbone and the Side Chain of γAsp-174/δAsp-180—Mutant cycle analysis was performed between several of the side chain mutations at γAsp-174/δAsp-180 and the αS191Sah mutation (Figs. 3 and 4). Briefly, mutant cycle analysis is used to determine the pairwise interaction energy between two residues in a protein using the equation given in Fig. 3. If the two residues do not interact, the change in free energy for the simultaneous mutation of both residues should simply be the sum of the free energy of each of the individual mutations. However, for residues that interact, the change in free energy for the double mutation will be non-additive. EC50-based mutant cycle analysis has been used to investigate interactions in Cys loop receptors by other researchers (30Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 31Price K.L. Millen K.S. Lummis S.C. J. Biol.

Further discussion can be found in the supplemental materials. Lengthening the side chain (γD174E/δD180E) has no impact on the interaction between these two residues (ΔΔG = 0.12 kcal/mol). In contrast, mutant cycle analysis between γD174N/δD180N and αS191Sah indicates a large energetic coupling (ΔΔG = 2.1 kcal/mol). A smaller but still quite significant effect is seen for the mutant cycle analysis between γD174Nha/δD180Nha and αS191Sah (ΔΔG = 1.4 kcal/mol). Mutant cycle analyses of γD174N/δD180N with αS191A and αS191Aah further support the conclusion that the interaction between these residues involves the backbone of αSer-191 and not the side chain (αS191Ala: ΔΔG = 0.25; αS191Aah: ΔΔG = 2.3 kcal/mol). Not surprisingly, comparable mutant cycle analyses of the two glutamates of loop F, γGlu-176/δGlu-182 and γGlu-163169/δGlu-163175, with αS191Sah showed no significant coupling. The AChBP crystal structures transformed the study of nAChRs by providing high resolution structural data about the ligand binding domain of these proteins. In addition to refining our existing structural knowledge of the receptor, obtained from decades of careful biochemical research, it served as a valuable starting point for new structure-function studies on the receptor. However, AChBP is not a ligand-gated ion channel and, in fact, shares less than 25! homology with its nearest Cys loop relative, the α7 nAChR (8Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). As such, some fundamental structural differences must exist between AChBP and actual Cys loop receptors, particularly pertaining to residues involved in mediating communication between the binding site and the ion channel pore. Arguably the biggest discrepancy between the AChBP structures and prior biochemical studies of the nAChR concerns the loop F residue γAsp-174/δAsp-180. A remarkable cross-linking study in the Torpedo nAChR indicated that this residue can come within 9Å of the vicinal disulfide on the C loop, located at the heart of the agonist binding site (5Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22603-22612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in AChBP, the residue that aligns with γAsp-174/δAsp-180 is not at all near the agonist binding site. In addition, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Torpedo nAChR, which is believed to be in the desensitized or closed state, places this residue tucked deeply inside a β-sheet-lined hydrophobic pocket, over 15 Å from loop C (9Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 10Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Although γAsp-174/δAsp-180 is remote to the agonist binding site in AChBP, another loop F anionic residue, γGlu-176δGlu-182, appears to make a hydrogen bond to a backbone N-H that is integral to the aromatic box of the agonist binding site when the agonist carbamylcholine is bound. Using nonsense suppression methodology, we have been able to specifically remove the backbone N-H in question by replacing αSer-191 with its α-hydroxy analogue. Consistent with the AChBP images, this subtle structural change has a large effect on receptor function, suggesting that a hydrogen bond to this moiety is important. However, consistent with prior mutational analyses (6Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3160-3164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Czajkowski C. Kaufmann C. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6285-6289Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Martin M. Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we find that γGlu-176/δGlu-182 does not play a large role in receptor function. This suggests that AChBP does not provide an accurate model of the muscle nAChR in this region. Given that the sequence alignment in this region shows a number of insertions in nAChR relative to AChBP, combined with the fact that the F loop is believed to be involved in gating the nAChR (AChBP does not gate), it is not surprising that AChBP would be an unreliable model here. Our results indicate that the hydrogen-bonding partner for the backbone N-H of αSer-191 in the nAChR is instead the side chain of γAsp-174/δAsp-180. Based on the available structural and functional data, we suggest that this hydrogen bond exists in the open state only (11Akk G. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Martin M. Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13497-13503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Martin M.D. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10742-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As others have seen, a number of mutations of this side chain profoundly affect receptor function. Here we employ several relatively subtle mutations. The fact that substantial functional consequences are seen suggests a precise structural role for this side chain in at least one state crucial for activating the channel. Furthermore, all mutations at γAsp-174/δAsp-180 that significantly impact function also show strong coupling to the αS191Sah backbone mutation via mutant cycle analysis. The nature of the coupling is as one would expect from the hydrogen-bonding model. Mutation at either site has a strong effect; however, once the αS191Sah mutation is introduced, removing any possible hydrogen-bonding interaction, mutations at γAsp-174/δAsp-180 have a much smaller impact. Interestingly, no specific role for the side chain of αSer-191 is found as the αS191A mutant gives essentially wild-type behavior. 7In AChBP structures, the αSer-191 side chain also makes hydrogen bonds to γGlu-176/δGlu-182. However, when the alanine side chain is combined with the α-hydroxy backbone mutation, the same coupling to γAsp-174/δAsp-180 is observed. We propose that the movement of loop F of the complementary subunit from a position remote to the agonist binding site to one of close proximity to loop C of the principal subunit is a key early structural change associated with nAChR gating. Driving this structural reorganization is the formation of a hydrogen bond between the side chain of γAsp-174/δAsp-180 and the backbone N-H of αSer-191. In the closed state of the wild-type receptor, αSer-191 and the C loop project out into solution, away from the bulk of the receptor, whereas γAsp-174/δAsp-180 of the F loop projects deep within a hydrophobic cavity. Although the energetic desolvation penalty of burying a charged residue within a hydrophobic cavity is significant, 8Based on the hydrophobicity constant, π, the expected desolvation penalty for an aspartic acid residue would be on the order of 1 kcal/mol (33Eisenberg D. McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1986; 319: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). it alone is apparently not sufficient to overcome other structural elements that bias this conformation of the F loop. However, agonist binding induces a centripetal movement of the C loop, bringing the backbone N-H of αSer-191 in closer proximity to the F loop. This structural change makes possible a hydrogen bond between γAsp-174/δAsp-180 and the C loop backbone. We hypothesize that the formation of this hydrogen bond, along with the energetic solvation benefit of moving γAsp-174/δAsp-180 into an aqueous environment, provides sufficient driving force to move γAsp-174/δAsp-180 out of its pocket, inducing a movement of the F loop toward the C loop. 9The possibility of a salt bridge forming here can be eliminated, given that there are no basic residues in the C loop or in its vicinity. This structural rearrangement of loop F contributes to the gating pathway. Using rate-equilibrium free energy relationships, Auerbach and co-workers (34Grosman C. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Nature. 2000; 403: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) have also concluded that γAsp-174/δAsp-180 moves early in the gating process. Our results provide an explanation for the cross-linking studies of Czajkowski and Karlin (5Czajkowski C. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22603-22612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and they are not in conflict with available structural information. The cryo-electron microscopy images of the Torpedo receptor show greater than 20 Å separation between αSer-191 and γAsp-174/δAsp-180 in the closed state. Still, the distance of less than 9 Å that is suggested by the cross-linking studies is plausible, provided that the residues are free to move closer, as occurs in our model of channel gating. A comparison of AChBP structures with and without agonist bound likewise shows that motions of loops C and F are the dominant structural rearrangements that occur when agonist binds. The fact that the hydrogen bond acceptor in loop F differs between AChBP and nAChR is not surprising, given that loop F is strongly implicated in nAChR gating and AChBP did not evolve to have a gating function. This model is also consistent with the γ174/δ180 mutants described here. Lengthening the side chain of this key F loop residue (γD174E/δD180E) effects a modest improvement in receptor function, either because the longer side chain can more easily reach its αSer-191 hydrogen-bonding partner or because it fits more poorly in the hydrophobic pocket, destabilizing the closed state. Any mutation that eliminates side chain charge has a significant impact on function, which is expected, given that these mutant side chains are poorer hydrogen bond acceptors and that they experience a much lower energetic solvation benefit upon moving from the hydrophobic pocket into an aqueous environment. In conclusion, mutant cycle analysis involving a novel backbone mutant has identified an important interaction between an F loop residue that has long been thought to contribute to receptor function and the peptide backbone of loop C. The hydrogen bond between the side chain of γAsp-174/δAsp-180 and the backbone of αSer-191 likely forms upon agonist binding and is part of the agonist-induced conformational changes that lead to channel opening. Along with contributing new insights into the gating pathway of the nAChR, our results reconcile a long-standing discrepancy between early biochemical studies of the receptor and structural models from the AChBP systems.

In this work, we analyzed single domain camelid antibodies produced against trans-sialidase. Llamas were immunized with a recombinant trans-sialidase and inhibitory single-domain antibody fragments were obtained by phage display selection, taking advantage of a screening strategy using an inhibition test instead of the classic binding assay. Four single domain antibodies displaying strong trans-sialidase inhibition activity against the recombinant enzyme were identified. They share the same complementarity-determining region 3 length (17 residues) and have very similar sequences. This result indicates that they likely derived from a unique clone. Probably there is only one structural solution for tight binding inhibitory antibodies against the TcTS used for immunization. To our surprise, this single domain antibody that inhibits the recombinant TcTS, failed to inhibit the enzymatic activity present in parasite extracts. Analysis of individual recombinant trans-sialidases showed that enzymes expressed from different genes were inhibited to different extents (from 8 to 98%) by the llama antibodies. Amino acid changes at key positions are likely to be responsible for the differences in inhibition found among the recombinant enzymes. These results suggest that the presence of a large and diverse trans-sialidase family might be required to prevent the inhibitory response against this essential enzyme and might thus constitute a novel strategy of T. cruzi to evade the host immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1988906504,"Chk2/CHEK2/hCds1 is a modular serine-threonine kinase involved in transducing DNA damage signals. Phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) promotes Chk2 self-association, autophosphorylation, and activation. Here we use expressed protein ligation to generate a Chk2 N-terminal regulatory region encompassing a fork-head-associated (FHA) domain, a stoichiometrically phosphorylated Thr-68 motif and intervening linker. Hydrodynamic analysis reveals that Thr-68 phosphorylation stabilizes weak FHA-FHA interactions that occur in the unphosphorylated species to form a high affinity dimer. Although clearly a prerequisite for Chk2 activation in vivo, we show that dimerization modulates potential phosphodependent interactions with effector proteins and substrates through either the pThr-68 site, or the canonical FHA phosphobinding surface with which it is tightly associated. We further show that the dimer-occluded pThr-68 motif is released by intra-dimer autophosphorylation of the FHA domain at the highly conserved Ser-140 position, a major pThr contact in all FHA-phosphopeptide complex structures, revealing a mechanism of Chk2 dimer dissociation following kinase domain activation."

We manipulated the amount (set size of 1, 3, and 5) and content (ratio of left and right pointing arrows within a set) of the inputs to test competing hypotheses regarding mental operations for information processing. Using a novel measure based on computational load, we found that reaction time was best predicted by a grouping search algorithm as compared to alternative algorithms (i.e., exhaustive or self-terminating search).

Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Kohlstaedt L.A. Rice P.A. Friedman J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The p66 subunit contains both polymerase and RNase H active sites. The p66-polymerase domain folds into an “open,” extended structure, forming a large active site cleft with the three catalytic residues (Asp110, Asp185, and Asp186) within the palm subdomain exposed in the nucleic acid binding site. The primer grip is responsible for the appropriate placement of the primer terminus at the polymerase active site and is involved in translocation of the primer-template (p/t) following nucleotide incorporation (12Ghosh M.

In contrast, p51 predominantly plays a structural role in the RT heterodimer, by stabilizing the dimer interface thereby favoring loading of the p66 onto the p/t and maintaining the appropriate enzyme conformation during initiation of reverse transcription (15Huang S.C.

The formation of the active heterodimeric HIV-1 RT occurs in a two-step process. First a rapid association of the two subunits (dimerization step) via their connection sub-domains thereby yielding an inactive intermediate RT, followed by a slow conformational change of this intermediate (maturation step), generating the biologically active form of this enzyme. The maturation step involves contacts between the thumb of p51 and the RNase H of p66 as well as between the fingers of p51 with the palm of p66 (20Divita G. Rittinger K. Geourjon C. Deleage G.

NNRTIs, including Efavirenz and Nevirapine, have been shown to promote HIV-1 RT maturation at the level of the Gag-Pol protein and to affect viral protease activation, resulting in the suppression of viral release from infected cells (30Tachedjian G.

Berducou C. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15097-15103Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have designed a peptide, Pep-A, derived from a structural motif located between residues 284 and 300, corresponding to the end of helix αI, the loop connecting helices αI and αJ and a part of helix αJ. This peptide is a potent inhibitor of RT interfering with the conformational change associated with full activation of the enzyme. However, although it significantly blocks RT maturation in vitro, it lacks antiviral activity (22Morris M.C. Berducou C. Mery J. Heitz F. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15097-15103Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have designed and evaluated a series of peptides derived from the thumb subdomain of RT using Pep-A as a template. We have identified a 17-residue peptide PAW, which constitutes a potent inhibitor of RT-polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT in vitro. We have demonstrated that PAW inhibits RT maturation and abolishes viral replication without any toxic side-effects. The characterization of the mechanism through which PAW inhibits RT, combining steady-state and pre-steady-state methods, together with size-exclusion chromatography has revealed that PAW only binds dimeric RT and stabilizes it in an inactive/non processive dimeric conformation that prevents the proper binding of p/t. Taken together, these results demonstrate that conformational flexibility of HIV-1 RT during maturation constitutes an attractive target for AIDS chemotherapeutics.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Poly(rA)-oligo(dT) and [3H]dTTP (1 μCi/μl) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. dTTP was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Roche Diagnostics (Meylan, France). MF membrane (25 mm, 0.45 μm) filters for RT assay were purchased from Millipore (Molshein, France). Primer and template oligonucleotides were from MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). A 19/36-mer DNA/DNA primer/template was used for steady-state fluorescence titration and stopped-flow experiments, with 5′-TCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCACT-3′ for the primer strand and 5′-TGTGGAAAATCTCATGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGA-3′ for the template strand. The sequence of the template strand corresponds to the sequence of the natural primer binding site (PBS) of HIV-1 (33Wain-Hobson S. Sonigo P. Danos O. Cole S. Alizon M. Cell. 1985; 40: 9-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The primer was labeled at the 3′-end with 6-carboxyfluorescein on thymine base. Primer and template oligodeoxynucleotides were separately resuspended in water and diluted to 100 μm in annealing buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl). Oligonucleotides were mixed together and heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and then cooled to room temperature for 1 h.Expression and Purification of HIV-1 RT Proteins—His-tagged RTs were expressed and purified as previously described (23Depollier J. Hourdou M.L. Aldrian-Herrada G. Rothwell P. Restle T. Divita G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1909-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Agopian A. Depollier J. Lionne C. Divita G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, M15 bacteria (Qiagen) were separately transformed with all the constructs of p51 and p66 subunits. Cells were grown at 37 °C up to ∼0.3 A595, then cultures were cooled to 20 °C and induced overnight with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial cultures expressing His-tagged p66 subunit were mixed with cultures expressing the His-tagged p51 subunit to enable dimerization during sonication. For protein isolation and initial purification, the filtered supernatant was applied onto a Hi-Trap chelating column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 150 mm NaCl supplemented with 50 mm imidazole. The heterodimeric p66/p51 RT was eluted with an imidazole gradient and finally purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column equilibrated with a 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 50 mm NaCl. Recombinant untagged HIV-1 BH10 RT was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (35Muller B. Restle T. Weiss S. Gautel M. Sczakiel G. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13975-13978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly homogeneous preparations from co-expression of the p66 and p51 subunits were stored in -80 °C in buffer supplemented with 50% glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 260 450 m-1.cm-1.Peptide Synthesis—Pep-A-derived peptides were purchased from GL Biochem, (Shanghai, China) and Genepep, SA (Prades le Lez, France). Pep-1 and PAW were synthesized using an (fluorenylmethoxy)carbonyl (Fmoc) continuous (Pionner, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) starting from Fmoc-polyamide linker-poly(ethylene glycol)-polystyrene resin at a 0.05-mmol scale. Peptides were purified by semi-preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (C18 column Interchrom UP5 WOD/25 M Uptisphere 300 5 ODB, 250 mm × 21.2 mm) and identified by electrospray mass spectrometry. PAW (1 mm) was coupled to FITC using maleimide-FITC (Molecular Probes. Inc., 5 mm) through overnight incubation at 4 °C in PBS (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescently labeled peptide was further purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (Interchrom UP5 HDO/25 M Modulo-cart Uptisphere, 250 mm × 10 mm) then identified by electrospray mass spectrometry.RT-Polymerase Assay—RNA-dependent-DNA RT-polymerase activity was measured in a standard reaction assay using poly(rA)-(dT)15 as p/t as previously described (5Restle T. Muller B. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8986-8988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of RT at 20 nm was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 80 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.15 μm poly(rA-dT), 15 μm dTTP, 0.3 μCi of [3H]dTTP). For peptide evaluation, HIV-1 RT was incubated with increasing concentrations of peptide inhibitors for 23 h, and polymerase reaction was initiated by adding reaction buffer. Reactions were stopped by precipitation of nucleic acids with 5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid solution for 2 h on ice, then filtered using a multiwell-sample collector (Millipore), and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid solution. Filters were dried at 55 °C for 30 min, and radionucleotide incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Data were fitted using a Dixon plot reporting the reciprocal of the velocity (1/v) as a function of inhibitor concentrations. Ki values for the different peptides were estimated from the intercept on the concentration axis (36Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1952; 55: 170-171Crossref Scopus (3274) Google Scholar).Steady-state Fluorescence Experiments—Fluorescence experiments were performed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm DTT, at 25 °C, using a SPEX-PTI spectrofluorometer in a 1-cm path-length quartz cuvette, with a band-pass of 2 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Excitation was performed at 492 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 500 to 600 nm. According to fluorescence experiments, a fixed concentration of FAM-labeled (19/36) p/t (50 nm) or of FITC-PAW (200 nm) was titrated with increasing protein concentrations from 5 nm to 1 μm. Data were fitted as previously described (34Agopian A. Depollier J. Lionne C. Divita G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37Rittinger K. Divita G. Goody R.S.

Samples containing 3–10 μm of RT or p51 were applied onto one or two HLPC columns and eluted with 200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml·min-1 (5Restle T. Muller B. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8986-8988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Rapid Kinetic Experiments—Binding kinetics of p/t onto HIV-1 RT were performed with a FAM-labeled p/t in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT, using a stopped-flow apparatus (Hi-Tech Scientific, Salisbury, UK) at 25 °C. A fixed concentration of FAM-labeled p/t (20 nm) was rapidly mixed with increasing concentrations of RT or RT·PAW complex formed at a 1/20 molar ratio (25–400 nm). 6-Carboxyfluorescein fluorescence was excited at 492 nm, and emission was detected through a filter with a cut-off at 530 nm. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using KinetAsyst 3 software (Hi-Tech Scientific), and traces were fitted according to a three exponential equation, as previously described (34Agopian A. Depollier J. Lionne C. Divita G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The rate constant for the first phase (k+1 and k-1), corresponding to the formation of a RT·PAW·p/t collision complex, was extrapolated from the slope and the intercept with the y axis of the plot of kobs1 versus RT concentrations. The k2 (k+2 + k-2) and k3 (k+3 + k-3) rate constants for the second and third phases corresponding to conformational changes of preformed RT·PAW·p/t complex were directly obtained from the three exponential fitting.Dissociation kinetics of HIV-1 RT were monitored by using bis-ANS as extrinsic probe Changes in bis-1 anilino-8 naphtalene sulfonate (bis-ANS) fluorescence provide a good signal-to-probe variation in the exposure of the hydrophobic regions associated to RT dissociation in a time-dependent manner. 0.5 μm RT was dissociated in the presence of 0.8 μm bis-ANS, by adding 10% acetonitrile in the absence or in the presence of 10 μm PAW. Kinetics of dissociation were monitored by following fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophan residues of RT and bis-ANS. Excitation of RT-Trp residues was performed at 290 nm, and the increase of bis-ANS fluorescence emission at 490 nm was detected through a 420 nm cut-off filter. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using KinetAsyst 3 software (Hi-Tech Scientific), and traces were fitted according to a single-exponential equation.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2). Cells were grown on glass coverslips to 75% confluency, then transfected with pcDNA3-p66RT plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). For colocalization experiments, cells were subsequently cultured for 32 h, before incubation with FITC-PAW or FITC-PAW/Pep-1 (complex obtained at a molar ratio 1/10) for 1 h. Coverslips were extensively rinsed with PBS, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton. After saturation in PBS supplemented with bovine serum albumin 1% for 1 h, cells were incubated overnight with monoclonal 8C4 anti-HIV-1 RT antibody (AIDS Research Reference Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health, diluted 1:100 in PBS-bovine serum albumin 1%), followed by Alexa-555 anti-mouse (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescence detection of HIV-1 RT and FITC-PAW was performed by epifluorescence microscopy using a PL APO 1.4 oil PH3 objective on a Leica DMRA 1999 microscope. Three-dimensional reconstitution of the 20 frames (interval, 0.3 μm) realized from z stacking was performed using Imaris 6.0 software.ATCC H9 cells, stably transfected with pNL4.3 V-R+ plasmid and constitutively expressing Gag-Pol HIV-1 proteins (obtained from Dr. R. Marquet, Institut de Biologie Moláculaire et Cellulaire, France) were used for RT pulldown experiments. H9 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% (w/v) fetal calf serum, 1% antibiotics (streptomycin 10,000 mg/ml, penicillin, 10,000 IU/ml) and G418 (1 mg/ml). PAW was incubated with 500 μl of activated CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation, supernatants were removed, and the beads were incubated with glycine, pH.8.0, for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle stirring. The beads were then washed with 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0), then 0.5 m bicarbonate buffer, and finally in PBS, three times each. The peptide bound to the beads were then saturated for 30 min in PBS/bovine serum albumin 0.1% and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with equal amounts of H9 cells lysed for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer (Tris, 20 mm, pH 7.2, NaCl, 400 mm, EDTA, 1 mm, DTT, 1 mm, and Protease inhibitors, EDTA free) and sonicated 2 × 5 s at 20%. Beads were washed with lysis buffer then twice with PBS, and the bound proteins were finally separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal 8C4 anti-HIV-1 RT antibody.Antiviral Assay—The anti-HIV activities of the whole series of peptides were assayed according to previously described methods (38Roisin A.

https://openalex.org/W2131492141,"Background Homologous chromosomes separate in meiosis I and sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, generating haploid gametes. To address the question why sister chromatids do not separate in meiosis I, we explored the roles of Shogoshin1 (Sgo1) in chromosome separation during oocyte meiosis. Methodology/Principal Findings Sgo1 function was evaluated by exogenous overexpression to enhance its roles and RNAi to suppress its roles during two meioses of mouse oocytes. Immunocytochemistry and chromosome spread were used to evaluate phenotypes. The exogenous Sgo1 overexpression kept homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids not to separate in meiosis I and meiosis II, respectively, while the Sgo1 RNAi promoted premature separation of sister chromatids. Conclusions Our results reveal that prevention of premature separation of sister chromatids in meiosis I requires the retention of centromeric Sgo1, while normal separation of sister chromatids in meiosis II requires loss of centromeric Sgo1."
https://openalex.org/W2079851469,"The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential component of DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and epigenetic inheritance. High expression of PCNA is associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. The 5'-region of the PCNA gene contains two computationally-detected estrogen response element (ERE) sequences, one of which is evolutionarily conserved. Both of these sequences are of undocumented cis-regulatory function. We recently demonstrated that estradiol (E2) enhances PCNA mRNA expression in MCF7 breast cancer cells. MCF7 cells proliferate in response to E2.Here, we demonstrate that E2 rapidly enhanced PCNA mRNA and protein expression in a process that requires ERalpha as well as de novo protein synthesis. One of the two upstream ERE sequences was specifically bound by ERalpha-containing protein complexes, in vitro, in gel shift analysis. Yet, each ERE sequence, when cloned as a single copy, or when engineered as two tandem copies of the ERE-containing sequence, was not capable of activating a luciferase reporter construct in response to E2. In MCF7 cells, neither ERE-containing genomic region demonstrated E2-dependent recruitment of ERalpha by sensitive ChIP-PCR assays.We conclude that E2 enhances PCNA gene expression by an indirect process and that computational detection of EREs, even when evolutionarily conserved and when near E2-responsive genes, requires biochemical validation."

However, viruses can also lose CTL epitopes by escaping the monomorphic antigen processing components of the pathway (proteasome and TAP) that create the epitope precursors. If viruses were to accumulate escape mutations affecting these monomorphic components, they would become pre-adapted to all hosts regardless of the MHC polymorphism. To assess whether viruses exploit this apparent vulnerability, we study the evolution of HIV-1 with bioinformatic tools that allow us to predict CTL epitopes, and quantify the frequency and accumulation of antigen processing escapes. We found that within hosts, proteasome and TAP escape mutations occur frequently. However, on the population level these escapes do not accumulate: the total number of predicted epitopes and epitope precursors in HIV-1 clade B has remained relatively constant over the last 30 years. We argue that this lack of adaptation can be explained by the combined effect of the MHC polymorphism and the high specificity of individual MHC molecules. Because of these two properties, only a subset of the epitope precursors in a host are potential epitopes, and that subset differs between hosts. We estimate that upon transmission of a virus to a new host 39%–66% of the mutations that caused epitope precursor escapes are released from immune selection pressure."

https://openalex.org/W2059882186,"Minimalist hybrids comprising the DNA-binding domain of bHLH/PAS (basic-helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim) protein Arnt fused to the leucine zipper (LZ) dimerization domain from bZIP (basic region-leucine zipper) protein C/EBP were designed to bind the E-box DNA site, CACGTG, targeted by bHLHZ (basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper) proteins Myc and Max, as well as the Arnt homodimer. The bHLHZ-like structure of ArntbHLH-C/EBP comprises the Arnt bHLH domain fused to the C/EBP LZ: i.e. swap of the 330 aa PAS domain for the 29 aa LZ. In the yeast one-hybrid assay (Y1H), transcriptional activation from the E-box was strong by ArntbHLH-C/EBP, and undetectable for the truncated ArntbHLH (PAS removed), as detected via readout from the HIS3 and lacZ reporters. In contrast, fluorescence anisotropy titrations showed affinities for the E-box with ArntbHLH-C/EBP and ArntbHLH comparable to other transcription factors (Kd 148.9 nM and 40.2 nM, respectively), but only under select conditions that maintained folded protein. Although in vivo yeast results and in vitro spectroscopic studies for ArntbHLH-C/EBP targeting the E-box correlate well, the same does not hold for ArntbHLH. As circular dichroism confirms that ArntbHLH-C/EBP is a much more strongly α-helical structure than ArntbHLH, we conclude that the nonfunctional ArntbHLH in the Y1H must be due to misfolding, leading to the false negative that this protein is incapable of targeting the E-box. Many experiments, including protein design and selections from large libraries, depend on protein domains remaining well-behaved in the nonnative experimental environment, especially small motifs like the bHLH (60–70 aa). Interestingly, a short helical LZ can serve as a folding- and/or solubility-enhancing tag, an important device given the focus of current research on exploration of vast networks of biomolecular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2002981816,"Telomere dysfunction is known to induce growth arrest (senescence) and cell death. However, the regulation of the senescence-death process is poorly understood. Here using a yeast dysfunctional telomere model cdc13-1, which carries a temperature sensitive-mutant telomere binding protein Cdc13p, we demonstrate that inhibition of TOR (Target of Rapamycin), a central regulator of nutrient pathways for cell growth, prevents cell death, but not growth arrest, induced by inactivation of Cdc13-1p. This function of TOR is novel and separable from its G1 inhibition function, and not associated with alterations in the telomere length, the amount of G-tails, and the telomere position effect (TPE) in cdc13-1 cells. Furthermore, antioxidants were also shown to prevent cell death initiated by inactivation of cdc13-1. Moreover, inhibition of TOR was also shown to prevent cell death induced by inactivation of telomerase in an est1 mutant. Interestingly, rapamycin did not prevent cell death induced by DNA damaging agents such as etoposide and UV. In the aggregate, our results suggest that the TOR signaling pathway is specifically involved in the regulation of cell death initiated by telomere dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1965767198,"The fossil record is the only direct source of data for studying modes (patterns) and rates of morphological change over long periods of time. Determining modes and rates is important for understanding macroevolutionary processes, but just how modes and rates vary within a taxon, and why, remain largely unaddressed. We examined patterns of morphological change in the shell of the Mesozoic marine bivalve genus Buchia over its geographic and temporal range. Most modes conformed to either random walks or stasis, and both modes and rates showed variability between locations. For example, stasis was more common in deeper marine environments, whereas random walks occurred more often at the highest paleolatitudes studied. These results indicate that the environment can play an important role in shaping patterns of evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2009749248,"The processing of Kanizsa figures have classically been studied by flashing the full ""pacmen"" inducers at stimulus onset. A recent study, however, has shown that it is advantageous to present illusory figures in the ""notch"" mode of presentation, that is by leaving the round inducers on screen at all times and by removing the inward-oriented notches delineating the illusory figure at stimulus onset. Indeed, using the notch mode of presentation, novel P1 and N1 effects have been found when comparing visual potentials (VEPs) evoked by an illusory figure and the VEPs to a control figure whose onset corresponds to the removal of outward-oriented notches, which prevents their integration into one delineated form. In Experiment 1, we replicated these findings, the illusory figure was found to evoke a larger P1 and a smaller N1 than its control. In Experiment 2, real grey squares were placed over the notches so that one condition, that with inward-oriented notches, shows a large central grey square and the other condition, that with outward-oriented notches, shows four unconnected smaller grey squares. In response to these ""real"" figures, no P1 effect was found but a N1 effect comparable to the one obtained with illusory figures was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that the P1 effect observed with illusory figures is likely specific to the processing of the illusory features of the figures. Conversely, the fact that the N1 effect was also obtained with real figures indicates that this effect may be due to more global processes related to depth segmentation or surface/object perception."
