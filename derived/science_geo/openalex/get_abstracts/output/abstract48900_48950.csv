https://openalex.org/W1999246265,"A highly specific polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against murine cachectin/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was prepared. When BALB/c mice were passively immunized with the antiserum or with purified immune globulin, they were protected against the lethal effect of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide produced by Escherichia coli. The prophylactic effect was dose-dependent and was most effective when the antiserum was administered prior to the injection of the endotoxin. Antiserum to cachectin/TNF did not mitigate the febrile response of endotoxin-treated animals, and very high doses of endotoxin could overcome the protective effect. The median lethal dose of endotoxin in mice pretreated with 50 microliters of the specific antiserum was approximately 2.5 times greater the median lethal dose for controls given nonimmune serum. The data suggest that cachectin/TNF is one of the principal mediators of the lethal effect of endotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W2094816576,"A 2.7 angstrom resolution x-ray diffraction analysis of a trypsin-modified form of the Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu reveals that the GDP-binding domain has a structure similar to that of other nucleotide-binding proteins. The GDP ligand is located at the COOH-terminal end of the beta sheet and is linked to the protein via a Mg2+ ion salt bridge. The location of the guanine ring is unusual; the purine ring is located on the outer edge of the domain, not deep within a hydrophobic pocket. The amino acids from Pro10 to Arg44 and from Gly59 to Glu190 have been assigned to the electron density with computer graphic techniques, and the resulting model is consistent with all known biochemical data. An analysis of the structure reveals that four regions of the amino acid sequence that are homologous with the family of ras oncogene proteins, termed p21, are located in the vicinity of the GDP-binding site, and most of the invariant amino acids shared by the proteins interact directly with the GDP ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1986823241,"Leprosy, a chronic infectious disease afflicting between 10 and 15 million people, is caused by the obligate intracellular parasite Mycobacterium leprae1. Although M. leprae was the first identified bacterial pathogen of man2, basic biochemical, immunological, diagnostic and therapeutic investigations have been severely limited because it remains one of the few human pathogens that have not been cultured in vitro. An M. leprae recombinant DNA expression library was constructed to provide a source of genes encoding proteins relevant for such studies. Monoclonal antibodies directed against M. leprae specific antigens3â€“7 have been used to isolate the genes encoding the five most immunogenic protein antigens of the leprosy bacillus. We report here that M. leprae specific epitopes recognized by all of 13 monoclonal antibodies tested were produced by recombinant phage in Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W2027536811,"We have localized proinsulin in B cells of human and rat pancreatic islets, using a proinsulin-specific monoclonal antibody revealed by immunocytochemistry. Proinsulin is abundant in Golgi stacks and clathrin-coated secretory granules. It rapidly disappears from these compartments when protein synthesis is inhibited. Depletion of ATP stores prevents movement of proinsulin from the Golgi stacks to the secretory granules; under these conditions, the prohormone in preformed coated granules is converted to insulin, whereas that bound to the Golgi complex is not. Non-coated granules show a low level of proinsulin reactivity under all incubation protocols. These findings provide direct evidence that coated secretory granules are the major, if not the only, cellular site of proinsulin to insulin conversion. They also suggest that the Golgi stack is not involved in conversion, and that intercisternal transport and coated granule formation are hitherto unrecognized energy-requiring steps that precede conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2093660936,"A model was developed for the structure of p21, the protein with a molecular weight of 21,000 that is produced by the ras genes. This model predicts that p21 consists of a central core of beta-sheet structure, connected by loops and alpha helices. Four of these loops comprise the guanine nucleotide binding site. The phosphoryl binding region is made up of amino acid sequences from 10 to 16 and from 57 to 63 of p21. The latter sequence may contain a site for magnesium binding. Amino acids defining guanine specificity are Asn-116 and Asp-119, and sequences around amino acid 145 may contribute to guanine binding. The model makes it possible to visualize how oncogenic mutations of p21 affect interaction with guanine nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1491721292,"The RecA protein of Escherichia coli optimally promotes DNA strand exchange reactions in the presence of the single strand DNA-binding protein of E. coli (SSB protein). Under these conditions, assembly of RecA protein onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) occurs in three steps. First, the ssDNA is rapidly covered by SSB protein. The binding of RecA protein is then initiated by nucleation of a short tract of RecA protein onto the ssDNA. Finally, cooperative polymerization of additional RecA protein accompanied by displacement of SSB protein results in a ssDNA-RecA protein filament (Griffith, J. D., Harris, L. D., and Register, J. C. (1984) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 49, 553-559). We report here that RecA protein assembly onto circular ssDNA yields RecA protein-covered circles in which greater than 85% are completely covered by RecA protein with no remaining SSB protein-covered segments (as detected by electron microscopy). However, when linear ssDNA is used, 90% of the filaments contain a short segment at one end complexed with SSB protein. This suggests that RecA protein assembly is unidirectional. Visualization of the assembly of RecA protein onto either long ssDNA tails (containing either 5' or 3' termini) or ssDNA gaps generated in double strand DNA allowed us to determine that the RecA protein polymerizes in the 5' to 3' direction on ssDNA and preferentially nucleates at ssDNA-double strand DNA junctions containing 5' termini."
https://openalex.org/W2035522784,"At least seven chromosome-sized DNA molecules (750 to 2000 kilobases in length and one fraction of undetermined molecular weight) from cultured clones and isolates of Plasmodium falciparum have been separated by pulsed-field gradient gel electrophoresis. Whereas asexual blood stages and sexual stages of the same line have identical molecular karyotypes, the length of chromosome-sized DNA molecules among different geographical isolates and several clones derived from a single patient is different. These length alterations of chromosomes are the result of DNA rearrangements that must occur unrelated to sexual differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1604663878,"The complete DNA sequence of the CAN1 locus of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is presented. The predicted primary translation product consists of 590 amino acids. From the hydropathic profile of the amino acid sequence (as calculated by the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (Kyte, J., and Doolittle, R. F. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157, 105-132)), one can divide the protein into two distinct regions. The 93-amino acid long N-terminal domain is extremely hydrophilic and does not exhibit any cleavable signal sequence. The rest of the protein (from amino acids 94 to 590) shows features typical for an integral membrane protein. The proposal for the N terminus of the primary translation product is based on results obtained by S1 mapping, insertion mutagenesis, and gene fusion experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1510595339,"Endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) can be rapidly purified from bovine brain to high specific activity using heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Purification of the mitogen by this method results in relatively high yields of the polypeptide (10 to 100 micrograms/kg of tissue) with biological activity on murine and human endothelial cells in the picogram range. The product obtained is a mixture of two single-chain polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 17,000 (alpha-ECGF) and 20,000 (beta-ECGF) by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The two forms of ECGF can be separated by either NaCl gradient elution from heparin-Sepharose or reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The two polypeptides are related on the basis of similar: amino acid compositions, affinity for heparin-Sepharose, cyanogen bromide and trypsin-derived cleavage products, and biological activity. Furthermore, the cyanogen bromide fragments derived from the two forms of ECGF also possess similar amino acid compositions and mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. These data suggest that there are at least two discrete molecular forms of ECGF in bovine brain and that these two molecules are structurally related."
https://openalex.org/W1496388590,"When Escherichia coli grows on acetate, the flow of isocitrate through the glyoxylate bypass is regulated, in part, through the phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase. In addition to its role in adaptation to alternative carbon sources, this phosphorylation system responds to variation in the intracellular level of isocitrate dehydrogenase. This system can compensate for changes in the cellular level of isocitrate dehydrogenase in excess of 10-fold, maintaining a nearly constant activity for isocitrate dehydrogenase during growth on acetate. The behavior of the phosphorylation system exhibited considerable strain-specific variation. This was most clearly demonstrated using mutants which lacked the ability to phosphorylate isocitrate dehydrogenase. In two strains, mutation of the gene for isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase rendered the cells unable to grow on acetate. In contrast, a third strain was relatively insensitive to a mutation in this gene. This lack of phenotypic expression appears to result from a lower cellular level of isocitrate dehydrogenase in this strain which renders the phosphorylation (and consequent inhibition) of isocitrate dehydrogenase less essential. The gene for isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase (aceK) was located in the glyoxylate bypass operon, downstream from the genes for isocitrate lyase and malate synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1529506325,"Maltose-binding protein (MBP) is essential for maltose transport and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli. To perform these functions it must interact with two sets of cytoplasmic membrane proteins, the MalFGK transport complex and the chemotactic signal transducer Tar. MBP is present at high concentrations, on the order of 1 mM, in the periplasm of maltose-induced or malTc constitutive cells. To determine how the amount of MBP affects transport and taxis, we utilized a series of malE signal-sequence mutations that interfere with export of MBP. The MBP content in shock fluid from cells carrying the various mutations ranged from 4 to 23% of the malE+ level. The apparent Km for maltose transport varied by less than a factor of 2 among malE+ and mutant strains. At a saturating maltose concentration 9% (approximately 90 microM) of the malE+ amount of MBP was required for half-maximal uptake rates. Transport exhibited a sigmoidal dependence on the amount of periplasmic MBP, indicating that MBP may be involved in a cooperative interaction at some stage of the transport process. The chemotactic response to a saturating maltose stimulus exhibited a first-order dependence on the amount of periplasmic MBP. Thus, interaction of a single substrate-bound MBP with Tar appears sufficient to initiate a chemotactic signal from the transducer. A half-maximal chemotactic response occurred at 25% of the malE+ MBP level, suggesting that in vivo the KD for binding of maltose-loaded MBP to Tar is quite high (approximately 250 microM)."
https://openalex.org/W1529583604,"Limited proteolysis of rat brain tubulin (alpha beta) by subtilisin cleaves a 1-2-kDa fragment from the carboxyl-terminal ends of both the alpha and beta subunits with a corresponding loss in negative charge of the proteins. The beta subunit is split much more rapidly (and exclusively at 5 degrees C), yielding a protein with cleaved beta and intact alpha subunit, called alpha beta s, which is of intermediate charge. Further proteolysis cleaves the carboxyl terminus of the alpha subunit leading, irreversibly, to the doubly cleaved product, named tubulin S, with a composition alpha s beta s. Both cleavage products are polymerization-competent and their polymers are resistant to 1 mM Ca2+- and 0.24 M NaCl-induced depolymerization. The two polymers differ in that the alpha beta s polymer is stable to cold, GDP, and podophyllotoxin, whereas tubulin S polymer is disassembled by these agents; moreover, alpha beta s forms ring-shaped polymers, whereas alpha s beta s forms filaments associated into bundles and sheets. Tubulin S co-polymerizes with native tubulin yielding a mixed product of intermediate stability. The presence of low mole fractions of tubulin S leads to a marked reduction in the critical concentration for polymerization of the mixture."
https://openalex.org/W1542122911,"Limited proteolysis has been utilized to study the structural organization of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. The enzyme (Mr approximately 89,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) consists of an amino-terminal, protease-susceptible region of unidentified function and a carboxyl-terminal, protease-resistant region of Mr approximately 40,000 containing the catalytic and calmodulin-binding domains. Partial digestion with trypsin produced an intermediate 56,000-dalton fragment and a stable 38,000-dalton fragment, both of which were catalytically active and calmodulin-dependent. Chymotryptic digestion yielded three catalytically active fragments of about 37,000, 36,000, and 35,000 daltons. The Mr = 37,000 fragment was calmodulin-dependent with an apparent affinity equivalent to that of the native enzyme (approximately 1 nM). The 36,000-dalton fragment was also calmodulin-dependent but had a approximately 200-fold lower apparent affinity. The Mr = 35,000 fragment was calmodulin-independent. These three chymotryptic fragments, had identical amino termini. Nineteen residues were missing from the carboxyl terminus of the calmodulin-independent chymotryptic fragment whereas only 8 or 9 carboxyl-terminal residues were missing from the calmodulin-dependent tryptic fragments. These results suggest that the 11-residue sequence (IAVSAANRFKK) in the carboxyl-terminal region of myosin light chain kinase contributes directly to the binding of calmodulin. This conclusion is in accord with data (Blumenthal, D. K., Takio, K., Edelman, A. M., Charbonneau, H., Titani, K., Walsh, K. A., and Krebs, E. G. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 3187-3191) that the carboxyl-terminal, 27-residue CNBr peptide of the native enzyme shows Ca2+-dependent, high affinity binding to calmodulin and that similar calmodulin-binding activity, although detectable in unfractionated CNBr digests of calmodulin-dependent enzyme forms, is much reduced in a CNBr digest of the calmodulin-independent, Mr = 35,000 chymotryptic fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1484510333,"Protease La is an ATP-dependent protease that catalyzes the rapid degradation of abnormal proteins and certain normal polypeptides in Escherichia coli. In order to learn more about its specificity and the role of ATP, we tested whether small fluorogenic peptides might serve as substrates. In the presence of ATP and Mg2+, protease La hydrolyzes two oligopeptides that are also substrates for chymotrypsin, glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe-methoxynaphthylamine (MNA) and succinyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-MNA. Methylation or removal of the acidic blocking group prevented hydrolysis. Closely related peptides (glutaryl-Gly-Gly-Phe-MNA and glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Ala-MNA) are cleaved only slightly, and substrates of trypsin-like proteases are not hydrolyzed. Furthermore, several peptide chloromethyl ketone derivatives that inhibit chymotrypsin and cathepsin G (especially benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Leu-Phe-chloro-methyl ketone), inhibited protease La. Thus its active site prefers peptides containing large hydrophobic residues, and amino acids beyond the cleavage site influence rates of hydrolysis. Peptide hydrolysis resembles protein breakdown by protease La in many respects: 1) ADP inhibits this process rapidly, 2) DNA stimulates it, 3) heparin, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and benzoyl-Arg-Gly-Phe-Phe-Leu-MNA inhibit hydrolysis, 4) the reaction is maximal at pH 9.0-9.5, 5) the protein purified from lon- E. coli or Salmonella typhymurium showed no activity against the peptide, and that from lonR9 inhibited peptide hydrolysis by the wild-type enzyme. With partially purified enzyme, peptide hydrolysis was completely dependent on ATP. The pure protease hydrolyzed the peptide slowly when only Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+ were present, and ATP enhanced this activity 6-15-fold (Km = 3 microM). Since these peptides cannot undergo phosphorylation, adenylylation, modification of amino groups, or denaturation, these mechanisms cannot account for the stimulation by ATP. Most likely, ATP and Mg2+ affect the conformation of the enzyme, rather than that of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1584011323,"The effect of purified Escherichia coli DNA photolyase on the UV light-induced pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproduct and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer was investigated in vitro using enzyme purified from cells carrying the cloned phr gene (map position, 15.7 min). Photoproducts were examined both as site-specific lesions in end-labeled DNA and as chromatographically identified products in uniformly labeled DNA. E. coli DNA photolyase removed cyclobutane dimers but had no activity on pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. Photoreactivation can therefore be used to separate the biological effects of these two UV light-induced molecular lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2084431964,"The effects of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the superior cervical ganglion of the cat were studied in vitro and in vivo with sucrose gap and multiunit recording, respectively. At a dose of 0.03 to 0.12 nanomole, VIP produced a dose-dependent, prolonged (3 to 15 minutes) depolarization of the ganglion and enhanced the ganglionic depolarization elicited by the muscarinic agonist acetyl-beta-methylcholine. At a dose of 1.8 to 10 nanomoles, the peptide enhanced and prolonged the postganglionic discharge elicited by acetyl-beta-methylcholine, enhanced muscarinic transmission in ganglia treated with an anticholinesterase agent, and enhanced the late muscarinic discharge elicited by acetylcholine. VIP did not affect the early nicotinic discharge elicited by acetylcholine or by electrical stimulation of the preganglionic nerve. It is concluded that VIP has a selective facilitatory action on muscarinic excitatory mechanisms in the superior cervical ganglion of the cat."
https://openalex.org/W1491892821,"Responses of the rat liver prekininogen mRNAs after induction of acute inflammation were examined by blot-hybridization and S1 nuclease protection analyses with the aid of cDNA probes specific for rat kininogens. Marked changes in the relative levels of the low molecular weight (LMW) prekininogen mRNAs were observed after administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, and the mRNA levels increased with a half-maximal dose of approximately 100 ng of lipopolysaccharide/100 g body weight. At maximum level of induction, the LMW prekininogen mRNAs comprised about 1% of total liver mRNA, thus representing a major component of the liver mRNA in the acutely inflamed rat. Differences in the inflammatory responses of various forms of the prekininogen mRNAs were then investigated by S1 nuclease protection analysis with the use of three different cDNA probes, each specific for either K-prekininogen or two types of T-prekininogens. Both of the T-prekininogen mRNAs increased progressively during the first 24 h after induction of inflammation, and at maximum level of induction, these two mRNAs increased about 10- and 13-fold over their normal level. In contrast, neither of the high molecular weight and LMW K-prekininogen mRNAs exhibited such an increase after induction of inflammation. Thus, the expressions of the rat T- and K-prekininogen mRNAs are differentially regulated in response to the induction of acute inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1988651143,"A Borrelia-like spirochete was detected in all three parasitic stages of Ornithodoros coriaceus, the soft tick implicated in the epizoology of epizootic bovine abortion. After the spirochete had been isolated, its distinctness from other North American tick-borne borreliae as well as from Spirochaeta aurantia, Treponema pallidum, and Leptospira interrogans serovar pomona was established on the basis of its morphology, protein components, and inability to infect mice. The spirochete is passed trans-stadially and via eggs by ticks, and it is also excreted in coxal fluid after ticks have fed and detached. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the spirochete may be causally related to epizootic bovine abortion."

https://openalex.org/W1583063946,"The biochemical basis for paraquat tolerance was investigated using one of the paraquat-resistant Escherichia coli mutants previously isolated. When grown in the absence of paraquat (PQ2+), the specific activities of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and NADPH:PQ2+-diaphorase, both required for the expression of PQ2+ toxicity, were comparable in the wild type and the mutant. However, growth in the presence of 1 mM PQ2+ resulted in greater induction of these two enzymes in the wild type than in the mutant. Nevertheless, when the mutant was grown in 50 mM PQ2+, the activities of these two enzymes were comparable to those of the wild type grown in the presence of 1 mM PQ2+. Measurement of cyanide-resistant respiration, an indication of intracellular superoxide generation, showed that the intracellular flux of superoxide mediated by subsaturating concentrations of paraquat was significantly lower in the mutant than in the wild type. Extracellular superoxide formation, as measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction, was higher in the wild type than in the mutant whether grown in the absence or the presence of PQ2+. The mutant did not show cross-resistance toward juglone or plumbagin, compounds known to exacerbate superoxide generation. The kinetics of [14C]PQ2+ uptake showed that the wild type accumulated PQ2+ against a concentration gradient, whereas the mutant seemed to do so only by facilitated diffusion. The results indicate that the impaired paraquat uptake system in the mutant results in the physiological and biochemical differences observed between the wild type and mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2048057009,"Antibodies to chromogranin, a secretory protein marker for the diffuse neuroendocrine system, were used to analyze rat lymphoreticular tissues by means of immunochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Chromogranin-positive cells were present in spleen, lymph node, thymus, and fetal liver. When these organs were gently dispersed and separated on a Ficoll gradient, the chromogranin-immunoreactive cells became enriched in the dense red-cell pellets. The unexpected distribution of these neuroendocrine cells in all immunologically relevant structures suggests that they may link the nervous and immunological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1524786058,"The effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and the subsequent treatment of diabetic animals with insulin were studied using a dose of streptozotocin that produces highly ketotic animals 48 h after injection. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase of diabetic animals had apparent Ki values for malonyl-CoA that were approximately 10 times greater than control animals, indicating a greatly decreased affinity for malonyl-CoA in the diabetic state. Subsequent treatment of diabetic animals with insulin for 5 days produced non-ketotic animals with normal blood glucose, and the affinity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase for malonyl-CoA was increased to the control level. Treatment of other groups of ketotic diabetic animals with insulin produced substantial changes in the carnitine palmitoyltransferase apparent Ki value for malonyl-CoA within 4 h. These results suggest that insulin modulates the ketotic state, at least in part, by increasing the affinity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase for malonyl-CoA to bring about inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1495506610,"The complete covalent structure of liver microsomal NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase from steer liver microsomes was determined. Cleavage at methionyl bonds gave 10 peptides accounting for all the residues of the protein. Acid cleavage of the reductase at the Asp-Pro bonds gave three peptides accounting for all the CNBr peptides in the molecule. Subfragmentation of these peptides by chemical and enzymatic cleavage provided overlaps which established all the fragments in an unambiguous sequence of 300 residues, corresponding to Mr 34,110. Limited tryptic digestion cleaved reductase at residues 28 and 119, yielding a preparation having two noncovalently linked peptides having a conformation which binds flavin and retains the structural features essential for NADH-cytochrome b5 activity. A model for the secondary structure of cytochrome b5 reductase is proposed that is based on computer-assisted analysis of the amino acid sequence. In this model the beta-turns are predominant and there is some 25% alpha and 30% beta structure."
https://openalex.org/W1594549221,"The aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli is branched and contains two terminal oxidases. The chain predominant when the cells are grown with low aeration terminates with the cytochrome d terminal oxidase complex, and the branch present under high aeration ends with the cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex. Previous work has shown that cytochrome d complex functions as a ubiquinol-8 oxidase, and that a minimal respiratory chain can be reconstituted in proteoliposomes with a flavoprotein dehydrogenase (pyruvate oxidase), ubiquinone-8, and the cytochrome d complex. This paper demonstrates that the cytochrome o complex functions as an efficient ubiquinol-8 oxidase in reconstituted proteoliposomes, and that ubiquinone-8 serves as an electron carrier from the flavoprotein to the cytochrome complex. The maximal turnover (per cytochrome o) achieved in reconstituted proteoliposomes is at least as fast as observed in E. coli membrane preparations. Electron flow from the flavoprotein to oxygen in the reconstituted proteoliposomes generates a transmembrane potential of at least 120 mV, negative inside, which is sensitive to ionophore uncouplers and inhibitors of the terminal oxidase. These data demonstrate the minimal composition of this respiratory chain as a flavoprotein dehydrogenase, ubiquinone-8, and the cytochrome o complex. Previous models have suggested that cytochrome b556, also a component of the E. coli inner membrane, is required for electron flow to cytochrome o. This is apparently not the case. It now is clear that both of the E. coli terminal oxidases act as ubiquinol-8 oxidases and, thus, ubiquinone-8 is the branch point between the two respiratory chains."
https://openalex.org/W1597691924,"The photoaffinity label 8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate (N3-ATP) was used to covalently modify the recA protein from Escherichia coli within its ATP-binding site. We have previously demonstrated that N3-ATP modification of recA protein is specific for the ATP-binding site and have isolated a unique tryptic peptide (T31), spanning residues 257-280, that contains the exclusive site of attachment of this ATP analog (Knight, K. L., and McEntee, K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 867-872). We performed a secondary proteolytic digestion of the [alpha-32P]N3-ATP-labeled T31 peptide using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and purified the resulting peptide fragments by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Based on a comparison of the amino acid compositions of all purified fragments and sequence analysis of one labeled fragment we determined that Tyr-264 is the exclusive site of N3-ATP attachment in recA protein. Photoaffinity labeling of recA protein was also performed in the presence of single-stranded DNA. Following trypsin treatment and separation of peptides by HPLC we showed that tryptic peptide T31 contained the exclusive site of N3-ATP attachment. A secondary proteolytic digestion was performed on both [alpha-32P]N3ATP-modified T31 and unmodified T31 using alpha-chymotrypsin. Comparison of the HPLC profiles and amino acid compositions of the resulting fragments was consistent with Tyr-264 as the exclusive site of N3-ATP attachment to recA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1488470855,"The N1 imino units in Escherichia coli tRNAfMet, tRNAGlu, tRNAPhe, and tRNATyr were studied by 1H-15N NMR using three different techniques to suppress signals of protons not attached to 15N. Two of the procedures, Fourier internuclear difference spectroscopy and two-dimensional forbidden echo spectroscopy permitted 1H and 15N chemical shifts to be measured simultaneously at 1H sensitivity. The tRNAs were labeled by fermentation of the uracil auxotroph S phi 187 on a minimal medium containing [1-15N]uracil. 1H and 15N resonances were detected for all of the N1 psi imino units except psi 13 at the end of the dihydrouridine stem in tRNAGlu. Chemical shifts for imino units in the tRNAs were compared with intrinsic values in model systems. The comparisons show that the A X psi pairs at the base of the anticodon stem in E. coli tRNAPhe and tRNATyr have psi in an anti conformation. The N1 protons of psi in other locations, including psi 32 in the anticodon loop of tRNAPhe, form internal hydrogen bonds to bridging water molecules or 2'-hydroxyl groups in nearby ribose units. These interactions permit psi to stabilize the tertiary structure of a tRNA beyond what is provided by the U it replaces."
https://openalex.org/W1491673352,"The lysosomal membrane enzyme acetyl-CoA: alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to terminal alpha-linked glucosamine residues of heparan sulfate. The reaction mechanism was examined using highly purified lysosomal membranes from rat liver. The reaction was followed by measuring the acetylation of a monosaccharide acetyl acceptor, glucosamine. The enzyme reaction was optimal above pH 5.5, and a 2-3-fold stimulation of activity was observed when the membranes were assayed in the presence of 0.1% taurodeoxycholate. Double reciprocal analysis and product inhibition studies indicated that the enzyme works by a Di-Iso Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism. Further evidence to support this mechanism was provided by characterization of the enzyme half-reactions. Membranes incubated with acetyl-CoA and [3H]CoA were found to produce acetyl-[3H]CoA. This exchange was optimal at pH values above 7.0. Treating membranes with [3H] acetyl-CoA resulted in the formation of an acetyl-enzyme intermediate. The acetyl group could then be transferred to glucosamine, forming [3H]N-acetylglucosamine. The transfer of the acetyl group from the enzyme to glucosamine was optimal between pH 4 and 5. The results suggest that acetyl-CoA does not cross the lysosomal membrane. Instead, the enzyme is acetylated on the cytoplasmic side of the lysosome and the acetyl group is then transferred to the inside where it is used to acetylate heparan sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1568101277,"Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes (insect gut stage) incubated with [U-14C]glucose synthesized Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol as practically the sole dolichol-P-P derivative. On the other hand, amastigotes (intracellular stage) of the same parasite synthesized four to five times more Man7GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol than Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol. Evidence is presented indicating that, whereas in epimastigotes only Man9GlcNAc2 was transferred to proteins, in amastigotes both Man7GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 were transferred in direct proportion to their respective amounts bound to dolichol-P-P. The change in the mechanism of protein N-glycosylation could be observed upon in vitro differentiation of amastigotes to epimastigotes. The dissimilar size of the main oligosaccharides transferred to proteins in epimastigotes and amastigotes was responsible for differences in two structural features of high mannose-type oligosaccharides present in mature glycoproteins of both forms of the parasite, namely the average size of the compounds and the structure of the main species of some isomer oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1490529366,"Several substrates of endogenous Ca2+- and phospholipid-sensitive protein kinase have been identified in plasma membranes and cytosol from rat adipocytes. Specifically, Ca2+ stimulates phosphorylation of a 40-kDa protein in isolated plasma membranes, an effect which is further enhanced by the addition of the phorbol ester tetradecanoylphorbol acetate and phospholipase C. The 40-kDa phosphoprotein is also present in the cytosol, and its phosphorylation is stimulated in a Ca2+-dependent manner by phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and phorbol ester. Direct addition of insulin to adipocyte plasma membranes stimulates phosphorylation of the 40-kDa protein in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal stimulation was observed at 10(-8) M insulin. At 6.7 X 10(-8) M insulin, phosphorylation of the 40-kDa protein was stimulated by 68 +/- 9% (n = 6). Addition of phorbol ester (1, 10, and 100 ng/ml) plus insulin further enhanced the phosphorylation (286 +/- 39, n = 3; 350 +/- 65, n = 4; and 323 +/- 42%, n = 5, stimulation, respectively). Analysis of the 40-kDa phosphoprotein by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that incubations containing no additions, insulin, and/or phorbol ester all resulted in the generation of a single and apparently identical phosphorylated 40-kDa species. These studies indicate that insulin and Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase stimulate phosphorylation of a 40-kDa protein in adipocyte plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1531956201,"Abstract We have covalently modified the recA protein from Escherichia coli with the adenine nucleotide analog 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (5'-FSBA). The rate at which the protein is modified shows a sigmoidal dependence on the concentration of 5'-FSBA suggesting that binding of the analog is characterized by positive cooperativity. Covalent modification of the protein results in irreversible inactivation of its single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity such that 100% inactivation is achieved when 25% of the enzyme monomers have been modified. Attachment of 5'-FSBA is specific for the ATP-binding site of recA protein as judged by the following criteria: (i) attachment of the affinity label to the protein appears to saturate at 1 mol of 5'-FSBA/mol of protein; (ii) binding of 5'-FSBA to recA protein is inhibited by ATP and competitive inhibitors of its ATP hydrolytic activity, e.g. adenosine-5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), ADP, UTP, and GTP, but not by adenosine; (iii) attachment of 5'-FSBA to the protein occurs at a single site as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography peptide separation. Following trypsin digestion of recA protein that had been covalently modified with [3H]5'-FSBA we isolated a single labeled peptide (T31) containing the exclusive site of 5'-FSBA attachment. A secondary proteolytic digestion was performed on both 5'-FSBA modified T31 and unmodified T31 using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and by comparison of the amino acid compositions of the resulting peptides we identified Tyr-264 as the exclusive site of 5'-FSBA attachment in recA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1497644888,"The complete amino acid sequence of a DNA- and heparin-binding domain isolated by limited thermolysin digestion of human plasma fibronectin has been obtained. The domain contains 90 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 10,225. The apparent molecular mass of this domain is 14 kDa when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The anomalously high molecular size estimation may be due to the inaccuracy of this method in the low range. The structure was established from microsequence analysis of the chymotryptic, tryptic, and Staphylococcus aureus protease peptides. The molecular ion of each of the chymotryptic peptides was obtained by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The domain has a preponderance of basic residues with a net charge of +5 at neutral pH. The basic nature of the domain may account for its affinity for the polyanions, DNA and heparin. The predicted secondary structure is beta-sheet, in common with all of the type III internal sequence homology structures obtained for fibronectin so far. The location of the domain in fibronectin was made possible by limited thermolysin digestion and identification of the fragments and by comparison of the sequence of the 14-kDa fragment with the partial structure of bovine plasma fibronectin. The domain comprises residues 585-675 and defines a region immediately adjacent to the collagen-binding domain. Numbering domains beginning at the amino terminus, this domain is Domain III after the fibrin/heparin/actin/S. aureus binding Domain I and the collagen-binding Domain II. The domain was obtained from a larger precursor (56 kDa) which bound heparin, DNA, and gelatin. Further digestion of the 56-kDa fragment gave rise to a 40-kDa fragment which only bound gelatin, and a 14-kDa fragment which only bound heparin or DNA. The 14-kDa fragment (Domain III) marks the beginning of the type III homology region in fibronectin, for there may be up to 15 repeats of 90 amino acids. The size of this domain corresponds to one repeat of 90 amino acids and it has some sequence homology to the other type III sequences found thus far in fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1552086546,"The ability of aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli to catalyze carbamylation of amino acids other than the natural substrate, L-aspartate, was examined. Cysteine, cysteate, cysteinesulfinate, and 3-nitroalanine showed kcat values at pH 7 of 0.16, 0.58, 5.2, and 62 s-1, respectively, while kcat with aspartate was 320 s-1. In a parallel study, competitive inhibition constants of 3-nitropropionate, 3-mercaptopropionate, 3-sulfopropionate, and 3-sulfinopropionate were found to be high, about 0.1 M, compared with that of succinate, 0.56 mM. Although cysteinesulfinate had low activity as a substrate, the pH dependences of kcat and kcat/Km in H2O and D2O observed with the compound closely paralleled those of aspartate. The results of these studies suggest that substrate specificity and reactivity are achieved in part by a strong, highly specific interaction of one or more active site residues with the beta-carboxylate of L-aspartate. Unlike the sigmoidal kinetics found with aspartate, saturation of native aspartate transcarbamylase by cysteine sulfinate showed a lack of cooperativity, even under conditions of activation of the reaction by ATP and inhibition by CTP. The cysteinesulfinate reaction was increased 9-fold by the bisubstrate analog N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate. These results were interpreted in terms of an inability of cysteinesulfinate to cause the allosteric conformational change promoted by aspartate."
https://openalex.org/W1492150736,"The mechanism of expression of the structural gene (td) of T4 phage thymidylate synthase, which contains a 1,017-base pair intron, was studied by employing a coupled transcription-translation system with a td containing recombinant plasmid (pKTd2) as template. The [3H]leucine-labeled protein products synthesized in this system were treated with antibody to the synthase and the resulting immunoprecipitate was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two labeled polypeptides were obtained, one with an Mr of 32,000 and the other with an Mr of 25,000. The former corresponds in molecular weight to a subunit of T4-thymidylate synthase and the other to the 183-amino acid peptide encoded by exon I, the 5'-end of the interrupted td gene. When pKTd2 restricted in exon I was used as a template, labeled immunopeptides were not detected but, when restricted in the intron region or in exon II, only the 25,000 Mr exon I product was obtained. Both peptides (Mr = 25,000 and 32,000) were synthesized when the gene was restricted downstream to exon II. Active enzyme, as measured by the tritium release assay, was shown to form about 6 min after the td gene was added to the in vitro protein synthesizing system, and followed the appearance of mature mRNA, as evidenced by S1 nuclease protection studies. The enzyme increased linearly for another 14 min in conjunction with the appearance of the Mr = 32,000 immunopeptide. The exon I product, however, preceded the Mr = 32,000 peptide, indicating that a post-transcriptional processing event may be required for mature mRNA to be formed. Measurement of the RNA products from the td gene in a transcriptional system, with labeled probes from specific regions of the td gene, provided evidence in support of an RNA processing mechanism involving intron excision and exon splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1516639659,"We have purified and characterized an oligopeptide binding protein released from the periplasm of Escherichia coli W by mild osmotic shock. The purified protein was greater than 97% homogeneous as determined by either sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr = 60,000) or isoelectric focusing (pI = 5.95). The binding protein has a Stokes radius of 30 A and a sedimentation coefficient (s(0)20,w) of 4.6 S. Based on these hydrodynamic studies, the native protein has a molecular weight of 56,000. The tripeptide, Ala-Phe-[3H]Gly, which is transported via the shock-sensitive sensitive oligopeptide permease, binds to the purified protein in dilute solution with a Kd of 0.1 microM and a stoichiometry of approximately 1 to 1. Results from this study support the hypothesis that this periplasmic oligopeptide binding protein functions in the initial recognition of peptide substrates for the oligopeptide permease system."
https://openalex.org/W1510750563,"Bakers' yeast flavocytochrome b2 is a flavin-dependent L-2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase which also exhibits transhydrogenase activity. When a reaction takes place between [2-3H]lactate and a halogenopyruvate, tritium is found in water and at the halogenolactate C2 position. When the halogenopyruvate undergoes halide ion elimination, tritium is also found at the C3 position of the resulting pyruvate. The amount tau of this intermolecular tritium transfer depends on the initial keto acid-acceptor concentration. At infinite acceptor concentration, extrapolation yields a maximal transfer of 97 +/- 11%. This indicates that the hydroxy acid-derived hydrogen resides transiently on enzyme monoprotic heteroatoms and that exchange with bulk solvent occurs only at the level of free reduced enzyme. Using a minimal kinetic scheme, the rate constant for hydrogen exchange between Ered and solvent is calculated to be on the order of 10(2) M-1 S-1, which leads to an estimated pK approximately equal to 15 for the ionization of the substrate-derived proton while on the enzyme. It is suggested that this hydrogen could be shared between the active site base and Flred N5 anion. It is furthermore shown that some tritium is incorporated into the products when the transhydrogenation is carried out in tritiated water. Finally, with [2-2H]lactate-reduced enzyme, a deuterium isotope effect is observed on the rate of bromopyruvate disappearance. Extrapolation to infinite bromopyruvate concentration yields DV = 4.4. An apparent inverse isotope effect is determined for bromide ion elimination. These results strengthen the idea that oxidoreduction and elimination pathways involve a common carbanionic intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1262304617,"The prenyl transferase undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase was partially purified from the cytosolic fraction of Escherichia coli. Its enzymic products were characterized as a family of cis-polyprenyl phosphates, which ranged in carbon number from C55 to C25. The enzyme is constituted of two subunits of approximately 30,000 molecular weight. A radiolabeled photolabile analogue of t,t-farnesyl pyrophosphate, [3H]2-diazo-3-trifluoropropionyloxy geranyl pyrophosphate, was shown to label Lactobacillus plantarum and E. coli undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase on UV irradiation in the presence of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and divalent cation. The only labeled polypeptide migrated on electrophoresis in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel at a molecular weight of approximately 30,000. No protein was radiolabeled when the natural substrate, t,t-farnesyl pyrophosphate was included in the irradiation mixture. Irradiation in the presence of MgCl2 without isopentenyl pyrophosphate gave less labeling of the polypeptide. Irradiation with only isopentenyl pyrophosphate gave little labeling of the polypeptide. When the enzyme was irradiated with 3H-photoprobe, [14C]isopentenyl pyrophosphate, and MgCl2, the labeled polypeptide gave a ratio of 14C/3H that indicated the product must also bind to the enzyme on irradiation. These results demonstrate the ability to radiolabel the allylic pyrophosphate binding site and possibly product binding site of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase by a process which is favored when both cosubstrate and divalent cation are present."
https://openalex.org/W1625232315,"We have studied the mechanism of reaction of the FLP protein of the yeast 2-micron plasmid on linear substrates. The products of the reaction are dependent upon the concentration of FLP protein. At low concentrations of FLP, products resulting from intramolecular recombination between two FLP target sites accumulate. At higher concentrations of FLP, intermolecular recombination results in the accumulation of products which are larger than the starting substrate. At higher concentrations still, FLP-promoted recombination is inhibited. Potassium chloride (0.15 M) inhibits the intermolecular reaction and also prevents the inhibition of FLP-mediated recombination caused by high concentrations of FLP protein. We present a model that explains these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1599630137,"Biologically active xenopsin-related peptide(s) were shown by radioimmunoassay to be liberated in nearly micromolar concentrations from substrate(s) with Mr greater than 70,000 during acid extraction of mammalian and avian stomach. The reaction displayed an enzyme-like temperature sensitivity, had a pH optimum of 2, and was fully inhibited in the presence of pepstatin A. Treatment of a stabilized gastric substrate with hog pepsin was found to mimic the reaction, producing immunoreactive xenopsin(s) which behaved similarly during high pressure liquid chromatography. Although some of the generated immunoreactivity co-chromatographed with xenopsin, it differed immunochemically when examined with a battery of region-specific antisera. Highly purified rat gastric immunoreactive xenopsin displayed xenopsin-like biologic effects, producing hypotension in the anesthetized rat and contracting the isolated guinea pig ileum. These findings suggest that there may be a renin/angiotensin-like system for the generation of xenopsin-related peptides in the stomach."
https://openalex.org/W1529130460,"Previous work (Nicholson, A. W., Hall, C. C., Strycharz, W. A., and Cooperman, B. S. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 3797-3808) showed that [3H]p-azidopuromycin photoaffinity labeled 70 S Escherichia coli ribosomes and that photoincorporation into 50 S subunit proteins was in the order L23 greater than L18/22 greater than L15. In the present work we report on immunoelectron microscopic studies of the complexes formed by p-azidopuromycin-modified 50 S subunits with antibodies to the N6,N6-dimethyladenosine moiety of the antibiotic. The p-azidopuromycin-modified 50 S subunits appear to be identical to unmodified control subunits in electron micrographs. Complexes of modified subunits with antibodies to the N6,N6-dimethyladenosine moiety of p-azidopuromycin were visualized in micrographs. Individual subunits with a single bound antibody (monomeric complexes) and pairs of subunits cross-linked by a single antibody (dimeric complexes) were separately evaluated and showed similar results. Two regions of p-azidopuromycin photoincorporation were identified. The primary site, seen in about 75% of the complexes, is between the central protuberance and small projection, on the side away from the L7/L12 arm, in a region thought to contain the peptidyltransferase center. The secondary site, of unknown significance, is at the base of the subunit maximally distant from the arm. These placements are essentially identical to those we observed in analyses of puromycin photoincorporation (Olson, H. M., Grant, P. G., Cooperman, B. S., and Glitz, D. G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2649-2656) and quantitatively similar to evaluations of monomeric puromycin-50 S subunit complexes. The data support the placement of proteins L23, L18/22, and L15 at or near the peptidyltransferase center at the primary site and suggest, in addition, that the secondary site includes a genuine area of puromycin affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2410778037,"Proteins cross-linked to pBR322 mRNAs and DNA by formaldehyde treatment of intact Escherichia coli cells have been detected with the use of a novel detection method. Among the proteins cross-linked to pBR322 mRNAs were S1, S21, and at least six other proteins of the small ribosomal subunit, initiation factor 1, elongation factor (EF) Tu, and very small amounts of EF-G and EF-Ts. The single strand binding protein, the HU-proteins, and RNA polymerase subunits alpha and beta were among the proteins cross-linked to pBR322 DNA. The results obtained suggest that the procedures described, can also be used to study interactions between different nucleic acid-bound polypeptides. The results are discussed in relation to the working mechanism of formaldehyde, and are compared to the results obtained with cross-linking induced by ultraviolet light. The methods presented should also be of use for the study of nucleic acid-protein interactions in other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1838978618,"Proteolytic digests of interleukin-2 from a human leukemic T-cell line produced by Escherichia coli carrying a recombinant DNA were analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The mass values of intense signals observed in the mass spectrum were consistent with peptides predicted from the nucleotide sequence of cDNA for human interleukin-2, an indication that the protein with the predicted amino acid sequence was produced by E. coli. BrCN and proteolytic digests of interleukin-2 obtained from cultured cells were also examined by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The observed mass values were identical with those from interleukin-2 from E. coli except for that of the NH2-terminal sequence, in which the Thr residue at position 3 was bound to a sugar moiety. The mass spectra of the digests of the two interleukin-2 preparations and synthetic peptides with sequences from 117 to 128 and 121 to 128 predicted from the nucleotide sequence of cDNA for a human interleukin-2 indicated that Cys residues at positions 58 and 105 are linked by a disulfide bond and that the Cys residue at position 125 is free."
https://openalex.org/W1569125512,"An Arg-Lys esteropeptidase that converts somatostatin-28 in vitro into somatostatin-14 was previously characterized in extracts of rat cerebral cortex. Both the octacosapeptide somatostatin-28 and a synthetic undecapeptide containing the sequence around the Arg-Lys site, i.e. Peptide I: Pro-Arg-Glu-Arg-Lys-Ala-Gly-Ala-Lys-Asn-125 I-Tyr (NH2), were used as substrates. We demonstrate that the converting activity is associated with neurosecretory granule fractions prepared from both cortical and hypothalamic tissue. This activity co-sediments with ghosts obtained from intact vesicles by osmotic shock. After solubilization either by mild ionic strength or sonication of vesicle membranes, the converting activity appears to possess properties indistinguishable from the convertase prepared directly from unfractionated tissue. It cleaves Peptide I to Ala-Gly-Ala-Lys-Asn-125I-Tyr (NH2) (Peptide II) and generates both the NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments of somatostatin-28, i.e. somatostatin-28 (1-12) and somatostatin-14, when the octacosapeptide is used as substrate. The selectivity appears to be strict and to depend upon the sequence around the Arg-Lys pair, as inferred from competition studies conducted with structural analogs possessing either an Arg-Lys or Arg-Arg doublet. It is concluded that this convertase could represent the enzyme system involved in the in vivo production of both the dodeca and tetradeca peptides from their common somatostatin-28 precursor."

https://openalex.org/W48563825,"Bacterium W3A1, a restricted facultative methylotroph, produces a periplasmic methanol dehydrogenase composed of two identical subunits of Mr = 57,300, and two noncovalently bound methoxatin prosthetic groups. A precursor form of Mr = 1,500 larger than the mature subunit was identified among the products of an in vitro translation of total RNA isolated from bacterium W3A1. The precursor form of the protein could not be detected in cells during in vivo pulse-labeling studies, suggesting that the processing of this precursor occurs entirely co-translationally. Whereas the holoenzyme was detectable only as a dimer, removal of the prosthetic group yielded an apoenzyme that could be detected as either a dimeric or monomeric species. After readdition of the purified prosthetic group to the apoenzyme, only the dimeric form of the protein, bearing the cofactor and exhibiting an absorption spectrum similar to that of the holoenzyme, was detected. Neither the mature apoprotein nor the holoenzyme demonstrated any affinity for phospholipid membranes, as assayed by their inability to bind to liposomes. Taken together, these data suggest a scheme of co-translational processing and export of the apoprotein subunits, followed by assembly of the subunits and prosthetic groups in the periplasmic space to form the mature holoenzyme. The suitability of bacterium W3A1, and other methylotrophic bacteria, for use in studies of protein biosynthesis and export, is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1486941833,"Wax esters of short chain acids (monomethyl-C6) constitute the major products of the uropygial gland of mallard ducks. During eclipse, the period (June and July) immediately following postnuptial molt, the production of short chain acyl groups is severely curtailed and longer chain acyl groups become the dominant components; after this period the composition reverts. These changes in composition were accompanied by corresponding changes in the level of S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase activity, and the level of the immunologically detectable amount of this enzyme. In vitro translation of the poly(A)+ RNA from the gland produced a 30-kDa protein which cross-reacted with rabbit antibodies prepared against this enzyme. The level of translatable mRNA for the thioesterase in the gland dramatically decreased as the birds went into eclipse and all of these changes reverted when the eclipse period was over. These results strongly suggest that the thioesterase is involved in the production of the short chain fatty acids in vivo and that during eclipse the expression of the thioesterase gene is suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W1998033043,"A method is presented for the detection in crude lysates of subnanogram amounts of proteins covalently bound to a specific nucleic acid sequence. The sensitivity of this method enabled us to study proteins cross-linked to specific DNA and mRNA sequences by irradiation of intact Escherichia coli cells with ultraviolet light. Among the proteins cross-linked to pBR322 DNA, the single strand binding protein, the HU-proteins, and the RNA polymerase beta and sigma subunits were present. Some, but not all proteins were cross-linked to 5-bromodeoxyuridine-substituted DNA more efficiently than to normal DNA. Ribosomal protein S1 is by far the most prominent protein cross-linked to mRNAs. Among the proteins cross-linked in smaller amounts to mRNAs are translation initiation factor IF 1, and at least six proteins of the 30 S ribosomal subunit, among which is S21. No 50 S proteins, nor IF-2, IF-3 or any of the elongation factors could be detected. Some UV-induced nucleic acid-protein cross-links were found to be heat-labile. It is concluded that the method employed may be used to compare the proteins interacting with different mRNAs, as well as single-copy DNA sequences from bacteria and eucaryotes with low complexity genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1489568725,"The kinetic mechanism of rat skeletal muscle hexokinase (hexokinase II) was investigated in light of a proposal by Cornish-Bowden and his co-workers (Gregoriou, M., Trayer, I. P., and Cornish-Bowden, A. (1983) Eur. J. Biochem. 134, 283-288). These investigators reported that the kinetic mechanism is ordered, with glucose adding before ATP and ADP dissociating from hexokinase before glucose-6-P. In addition, these workers suggest that glucose-6-P and ATP add to allosteric sites on hexokinase. We investigated the mechanism of action of hexokinase II by studying initial rate kinetics in the nonphysiological direction and by isotope exchange at chemical equilibrium. The former experiments were carried out in the absence of inhibitors and then with AMP, which is a competitive inhibitor of ADP, and with glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, a competitive inhibitor of glucose-6-P. The findings from these experiments suggest that the kinetic mechanism is rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi. Isotope exchange at equilibrium studies also supports the random nature of the muscle hexokinase reaction; however, they also suggest that the mechanism is partially ordered, i.e. there is a preferred pathway associated with the branched mechanism. Approximately two-thirds of the flux through the hexokinase reaction involves the glucose on first glucose-6-P off last branch of the Random Bi Bi mechanism. These results imply that the kinetic mechanism is steady state Random Bi Bi. There is some evidence to suggest that glucose-6-P binds to an allosteric site on muscle hexokinase, but none to suppose that ATP binds allosterically. Analysis of the mechanism of Gregoriou et al. suggests that it is at variance with the findings of this report as well as with data available from other laboratories."

There is almost complete conversion of LC 50 S ribosomes to TC 50 S ribosomes on treatment with EF-G, GTP, and fusidic acid. Similarly, TC 50 S ribosomes are converted to LC 50 S ribosomes, although partially, by treatment with EF-G and a GTP analogue like guanyl-5'-yl methylenediphosphate (GMP-P(CH2)P) or guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (GMP-P(NH)P) and including a polymer of 5'-uridylic acid (poly(U] in the incubation mixture. Furthermore, LC 23 S RNA isolated from LC 50 S ribosomes is converted to TC 23 S RNA on heat treatment, but similar treatment does not affect TC 23 S RNA. The interconversion was followed by several physical and biological characteristics of TC and LC 50 S ribosomes, like association capacities with 30 S ribosomes before and after kethoxal treatment, susceptibility to RNase I and polyphenylalanine-synthesizing capacity in association with 30 S ribosomes, as well as thermal denaturation profiles, circular dichroic spectra, and association capacity of isolated 23 S RNAs. These data strongly support the proposition that TC and LC 50 S ribosomes are the products of translocation during protein synthesis. The conformational change of 23 S RNA induced by EF-G and GTP is most probably responsible for the interconversion, and L7/L12 proteins play an important role in the process. A two-site model based on kethoxal data has also been proposed to explain the tightness and looseness of 70 S couples."
