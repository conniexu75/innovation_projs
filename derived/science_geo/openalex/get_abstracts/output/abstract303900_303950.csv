https://openalex.org/W2026889131,"Fluids play a critical role in subduction zones and arc magmatism. At shallow levels in subduction zones (<40 kilometers depth), expulsion of large volumes of pore waters and CH(4)-H(2)O fluids produced by diagenetic and low-grade metamorphic reactions affect the thermal and rheological evolution of the accretionary prism and provide nutrients for deep-sea biological communities. At greater depths, H(2)O and CO(2) released by metamorphic reactions in the subducting oceanic crust may alter the bulk composition in the overlying mantle wedge and trigger partial melting reactions. The location and conse-quences of fluid production in subduction zones can be constrained by consideration of phase diagrams for relevant bulk compositions in conjunction with fluid and rock pressure-temperature-time paths predicted by numerical heat-transfer models. Partial melting of subducting, amphibole-bearing oceanic crust is predicted only within several tens of million years of the initiation of subduction in young oceanic lithosphere. In cooler subduction zones, partial melting appears to occur primarily in the overlying mantle wedge as a result of fluid infiltration."
https://openalex.org/W2027936730,"The earth's mantle is degassed along mid-ocean ridges, while rehydration and possibly recarbonaton occurs at subduction zones. These processes and the speciation of C-H-O fluids in the mantle are related to the oxidation state of mantle peridotite. Peridotite xenoliths from continental localities exhibit an oxygen fugacity (fo(2)) range from -1.5 to +1.5 log units relative to the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) buffer. The lowest values are from zones of continental extension. Highly oxidized xenoliths (fo(2) greater than FMQ) come from regions of recent or acive subduction (for example, Ichinomegata, Japan), are commonly amphibole-bearing, and show trace element and isotopic evidence of fluid-rock interaction. Peridotites from ocean ridges are reduced and have an averae fo(2) of about -0.9 log units relative to FMQ, virtually coincident with values obtained from mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses. These data are further evidence of the genetic link between MORB liquids and residual peridotite and indicate that the asthenosphere, although reducing, has CO(2) and H(2)O as its major fluid species. Incorporation of oxidized material from subduction zones into the continental lithosphere produces xenoliths that have both asthenospheric and subduction signatures. Fluids in the lithosphere are also dominated by CO(2) and H(2)O, and native C is generally unstable. Although the occurrence of native C (diamond) in deep-seated garnetiferous xenoliths and kimberlites does not require reducing conditions, calculations indicate that high Fe(3+) contents are stabilized in the garnet structure and that fo(2) deareases with increasing depth."
https://openalex.org/W1976948864,"The curvature elastic energy of bilayer vesicles formed by a mixture of two surfactants, which individually form either micelles or lamellar bilayer phases is described theoretically. In the limit of large bending elastic modulus K being much greater than the temperature T, the free energy is minimized by vesicles with different concentrations of the two surfactants in each monolayer of the bilayer. Vesicles are more stable than lameliar structures only when interactions or complexing of the two surfactants is taken into account."

Neptune and Saturn are the windiest planets, Jupiter is the most active, and Uranus is a tipped-over version of the others. Large oval storm systems exhibit complicated time-dependent behavior that can be simulated in numerical models and laboratory experiments. The largest storm system, the Great Red Spot of Jupiter, has survived for more than 300 years in a chaotic shear zone where smaller structures appear and dissipate every few days. Future space missions will add to our understanding of small-scale processes, chemical composition, and vertical structure. Theoretical hypotheses about the interiors provide input for fluid dynamical models that reproduce many observed features of the winds, temperatures, and cloud patterns. In one set of models the winds are confined to the thin layer where clouds form. In other models, the winds extend deep into the planetary fluid interiors. Hypotheses will be tested further as observations and theories become more exact and detailed comparisons are made."

These observations are attributed largely to fluctuations in time and space of three complex larval resources associated with the availability of food. This cotnplexity also entails selection pressure favoring the observed low dispersal tendency of adults."
https://openalex.org/W2006672401,"Two of the most important agents of geological change, solar energy and internal heat from the mantle, meet and battle for dominance in propelling aqueous and related fluids in the earth's upper crust. Which prevails and how they interact are subjects of active research. Recent work has demonstrated that both agents can propel fluids over nearly continental-scale distances in a fashion that influences a host of important geological processes and leaves a record in chemical alteration, mineral deposits, and hydrocarbon resources."
https://openalex.org/W1999133461,"The length of larval life in the nudibranch Phestilia sibogae is determined by a chance encounter with a specific metamorphic stimulus associated with the post-larval benthic habitat. A developmental hiatus begins at the onset of larval metamorphic competence and ends at metamorphosis; aging is suspended during this hiatus. Because the duration of post-larval life is unaffected by the duration of larval life, total life-span varies with the length of the larval period. Developmental control of the timing of expression of life-history stages is an important factor regulating aging and senescence in animals with complex life cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2171022904,"Records of direct observations of the earth's magnetic field cover less than a ten-millionth ofthe known lifetime of the field. Thus our knowledge of several geomagnetic phenomena, critical to our understanding of the geodynamo, must come firom the paleomagnetic record. A combination of substantial advances during the past decade or so both in dynamo theory (previously the domain of the mathematician) and in paleomagnetism (previously the domain of the geologist) has led to provocative models of the earth's magnetic field and a better understanding of the geodynamo."

https://openalex.org/W2050188058,"Recent theoretical advances in physical oceanography have produced plausible models for the structure of the circulation in the oceans' subtropical gyres. These theoretical ideas are reviewed and assessed in the light of present observational evidence. The dominant role of potential vorticity is emphasized in describing the strong interplay between three-dimensional distributions of density and velocity. In particular, the complementary processes of subduction and recirculation jointly act to shape the circulation pattern of the subtropical gyre."
https://openalex.org/W2031532894,"The attenuation of upper crustal seismic waves that are refracted with a velocity of about 6 kilometers per second varies greatly among profiles in the area of the New Madrid seismic zone in the central Mississippi Valley. The waves that have the strongest attenuation pass through the seismic trend along the axis of the Reelfoot rift in the area of the Blytheville arch. Defocusing of the waves in a low-velocity zone and/or seismic scattering and absorption could cause the attenuation; these effects are most likely associated with the highly deformed rocks along the arch. Consequently, strong seismic-wave attenuation may be a useful criterion for identifying seismogenic fault zones."

https://openalex.org/W1997622818,"East Germans are working hard on a strategy to improve their polluted environment. Industrial plants are largely responsible for this pollution. A shroud of haze veils the suburbs of East Berlin. Far to the south the giant power plants around Leipzig pour more dust and sulfur dioxide into the air than in any other country in Europe. More than 90% of the country's electricity comes from brown coal, accompanied by prodigious quantities of dust and sulfur dioxide: almost 6 million tones of sulfur dioxide and more than 2 million tones of dust in 1988. East Germany enjoys some of the cheapest energy in the world, and the world's third highest energy consumption per capita, behind the United States, and Canada. Naturally, is also suffers air quality and health problems. The country is trying to cut down on consumption and clean up on generation. Actually, water quality is the number one priority, which unlike air is in very short supply."
