https://openalex.org/W2077538690,"Thirteen species of planktonic foraminifera collected with vertically stratified zooplankton tows in the slope water, Gulf Stream cold core ring, and northern Sargasso Sea show significant differences in their vertical distributions in the upper 200 meters of these different hydrographic regimes. Gulf Stream cold core rings may be responsible for a southern displacement of the faunal boundary associated with the Gulf Stream when reconstructed from the deep-sea sediment record. Oxygen isotope analyses of seven species reveal that nonspinose species (algal symbiont-barren) apparently calcify in oxygen isotope equilibrium, whereas spinose species usually calcify out of oxygen isotope equilibrium by approximately -0.3 to -0.4 per mil in delta(18)O values. The isotope data indicate that foraminifera shells calcify in depth zones that are significantly narrower than the overall vertical distribution of a species would imply."
https://openalex.org/W2024614197,"Analysis of micropaleontologic evidence in a deep-sea core in the south-west Indian Ocean indicates that the Agulhas Current was not a dominant feature of this region during glacial intervals. Interpretation of the fossil record, based on the analysis of modern faunal analogs, indicates that during glacial intervals the Agulhas Current was not the strong, year-round current that it is today. Evidence shows that during summer months a weak tropical current was present. During winter months the current was replaced by cool, high-salinity waters. This interpretation suggests that seasonal changes in circulation may have been more pronounced in the southwest Indian Ocean during glacial intervals than today."

This result supports the hypothesis that the formation of an intracellular calcium gradient is an essential step in the polarization of these eggs; the rhizoid forms at the pole that has the higher concentration of calcium."
https://openalex.org/W2044326043,"The meteorite Tenham was observed by transmission electron microscopy and ringwoodite and majorite, the high-pressure polymorphs of olivine and pyroxene, were identified. Ringwoodite contains antiphase boundaries and straight dislocations that are probably dissociated. Mantle flow of spinel might proceed by pure climb, and whole-mantle convection may be possible if the grain size is small enough."

https://openalex.org/W1981742464,"An unusual carbon-rich material found in the Abee meteorite is highly enriched in volatile elements, by factors of 10(4) relative to the case for nonvolatile elements. Volatile-rich material of this type might form in the solar nebula toward the end of accretion, when small amounts of residual dust acquire all the uncondensed volatile elements. The mercury enrichment factor of 8500 could explain the paradox of the excess abundance of this element in meteorites."

https://openalex.org/W2014325765,"The 1979 Nobel Prize for Chemistry has been awarded jointly to Georg Wittig of the University of Heidelberg and Herbert C. Brown of Purdue University for their separate work in organic synthesis. Wittig's major achievement was the development of a highly specific method for the synthesis of olefins. Brown found major new routes to add substituents to olefins selectively. Both employed elements that had found little previous use in organic synthesis, and both prospered by following up on unexpected observations."

https://openalex.org/W2066890226,"IT is a pleasure for me to meet with members of the Academy of Political Science. I feel honored and privileged to acquaint you with certain facts pertaining to the all-important question of rubber-natural and man-made. America is in the grip of a rubber crisis. This is a fact. Our country, which normally uses more than half of all the rubber that is consumed throughout the world, has been shut off by decisive enemy action from sources which formerly supplied over 90 per cent of the world's rubber. We are now engaged in a grim race against time. Several hundred thousand tons of new rubber, or its equivalent, will shortly be urgently needed to manufacture the wide range of war products required by the armed forces of the United Nations and to keep our vital industrial plants and essential transportation functioning. The crisis that we face resolves itself into a question of whether we can bridge the gap until synthetic rubber manufacturing facilities, now under construction within our country's borders, are producing the huge quantities of this indispensable material that we shall need to win the war. Every now and then someone states publicly that the best way to solve the rubber problem is to lick the Japs. The thrilling and heartening news that has come to us in the last thirty-six hours is clear evidence that we know what the objective is in this war: to defeat our enemies. But I want to say that those responsible for the logistics of rubber are not taking into their balance sheet any rubber or any source of rubber that is now held by the enemy. It seems odd that we should be faced with a crisis in rubber"
