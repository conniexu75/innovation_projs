https://openalex.org/W2139266365,"Mouse peritoneal macrophages, loaded with cholesteryl ester by incubating with acetylated human low density lipoprotein containing [3H]cholesteryl oleate, were exposed to purified human apolipoproteins (apo) A-I, A-II, C-III, or E in aqueous solutions. Unesterified cholesterol was released into the medium in the presence of apoA-I, -A-II, or -E, accompanied by the decrease in intracellular cholesteryl ester. ApoC-III had no such effects. Apparent Km values of the cholesterol release were estimated as 0.11, 0.14, and 0.24 microM, and Vmax values 35, 11, and 14 micrograms of cholesterol/mg of cell protein/6 h, for apoA-I, -A-II, and -E, respectively. The products formed with apoA-I, -A-II, or -E in the media were analyzed by density gradient ultracentrifugation when the cells were preloaded with [3H]cholesteryl oleate-acetylated low density lipoproteins and [3H]choline. Free [3H]cholesterol, [3H]phosphatidylcholine, and [3H]sphingomyelin were detected coincidentally as a symmetric peak at the density of 1.1 in each case. In the complex of lipids and apoA-I or apoA-II, the weight ratios of apolipoprotein/cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine/sphingomyelin/lysophosphatidyl- choline were estimated as 2.2:1:0.6:0.2:0.07 and 4.0:1:0.5:0.3:0.07, respectively. Both of the products formed with apoA-I and -A-II migrated slower than plasma high density lipoprotein in electrophoresis on agarose gel. Because the Km values are as low as 1:340-400, 1:140-160, and 1:6-8 of plasma concentrations of apoA-I, -A-II, and -E, respectively, the results have physiological relevance for a function of the free apolipoproteins in interstitial fluid to form high density lipoprotein and to reduce cellular cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2168543199,"Highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) is the substrate often used in scanning tunneling microscope (STM) studies of biomolecules such as DNA. All of the images presented in this article are of freshly cleaved HOPG surfaces upon which no deposition has occurred. These images illustrate features previously thought to be due to biological molecules, such as periodicity and meandering of ""molecules"" over steps. These features can no longer be used to distinguish real molecules from features of the native substrate. The feasibility of the continued use of HOPG as a substrate for biological STM studies is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2160241210,"Assays for two distinct phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activities were established based upon a differential inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). The activity that is insensitive to this reagent in rat liver is predominantly in the plasma membrane fraction, whereas the NEM-sensitive activity is in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions. The NEM-insensitive activity is further distinguished from the NEM-sensitive phosphohydrolase by: (a) being relatively stable to heat; (b) not being inhibited by phenylglyoxal, butane-2,3-dione, cyclohexane-1,2-dione, 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, and diethyl pyrocarbonate; (c) being inhibited by NaF and phosphatidylcholine; and (d) not being stimulated by Mg2+. The NEM-insensitive activity was specific for phosphatidate. Both phosphohydrolase activities could be inhibited by chlorpromazine, propranolol, sphingosine, and spermine. The NEM-sensitive phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity was increased by incubating hepatocytes for 12 h with glucagon and dexamethasone, and this effect was antagonized by insulin. The NEM-sensitive phosphohydrolase is concluded to be involved in glycerolipid synthesis. The activity of the NEM-insensitive phosphohydrolase was not altered by preincubation of rat hepatocytes in the short or long term with vasopressin, glucagon, insulin, triiodothyronine, or dexamethasone, but it might be modulated indirectly by sphingosine. The NEM-insensitive enzyme of the plasma membranes could be involved in signal transduction via the agonist-stimulated degradation of phosphatidylcholine through the phospholipase D pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1647537327,"Selective mRNA degradation is an important control point in the transient expression of a variety of mRNAs coding for growth regulators. A variety of labile mRNAs coding for lymphokines, cytokines, and oncogenes contain within their 3'-untranslated region an AU-rich region shown to destabilize these messages. We recently identified a cytosolic protein, adenosine-uridine binding factor (AUBF), which complexes with four tandem AUUUA reiterations of a synthetic RNA transcript. We now show that AUBF forms RNase T1-resistant band-shifted complexes with a variety of in vitro transcribed mRNAs including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-gamma, interleukin-3, c-fos, and v-myc. Formation of complexes was specifically inhibited by AUUUA containing RNA, but not by irrelevant RNA. After brief ultraviolet light-induced cross-linking, AUBF.RNA complexes with the exception of c-fos comigrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mutations within the AUUUA motifs demonstrate that both nucleotide sequence and secondary structure are important in AUBF.AUUUA RNA complex formation. Based upon these data, we suggest AUBF may interact with a variety of labile mRNAs with multiple AUUUA reiterations or single reiterations within an AU-rich 3'-untranslated region."
https://openalex.org/W1585759343,"We have previously shown that protein-protein interactions mediate cooperative binding of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domain to a glucocorticoid response element (Dahlman-Wright, K., Siltala-Roos, H., Carlstedt-Duke, J., and Gustafsson, J.-A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14030-14035). The cooperativity of DNA binding is lost when the distance between the two half-sites constituting a glucocorticoid responsive element is altered or when their relative orientation is changed. We show here that mutations in the responsive element which interfere with cooperative DNA binding by the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domain in vitro also abolish transactivation by the full length glucocorticoid receptor in vivo. We also identify a short segment in the proximity of one of the bound zinc ions that is required for cooperative binding of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domain to a glucocorticoid response element. We suggest that this segment is involved in dimer formation of the native glucocorticoid receptor and that it is important for correct positioning of the dimeric molecule on the double helix of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1578949454,"Abstract ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that serve as GTP-dependent allosteric activators of cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Four species of mammalian ARF, termed ARF 1-4, have been identified by cloning. Hybridization of a bovine ARF 2 cDNA under low stringency with mammalian poly(A)+ RNA resulted in multiple bands that were subsequently assigned to the known ARF genes using ARF-specific oligonucleotide probes. The relative signal intensities of some bands (e.g. the 3.8- and 1.3-kilobase (kb) mRNAs) that hybridized with the cDNA were not, however, consistent with the intensities observed with the individual ARF-specific oligonucleotide probes. These inconsistencies suggested that other ARF-like mRNAs were comigrating with known ARF mRNAs. To explore this possibility, a cyclic AMP-differentiated HL-60 Lambda ZAP library was screened using the bovine ARF 2 cDNA. Clones corresponding to known ARF genes (1, 3, and 4) were identified by hybridization of positive clones with oligonucleotide probes specific for each ARF species; ARF 2 cDNA-positive, oligonucleotide-negative clones were sequenced. Two new ARF-like genes, ARF 5 and 6, encoding proteins of 180 and 175 amino acids, respectively, were identified. Both proteins contain consensus sequences believed to be involved in guanine nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis. ARF 5 was most similar in deduced amino acid sequence to ARF 4, which also has 180 amino acids. ARF 6, whose deduced amino acid sequence is identical with that of a putative chicken pseudogene (CPS1) except for a serine/threonine substitution, was different from other ARF species in size and deduced amino acid sequence. With mammalian poly(A)+ RNA from a variety of tissues and cultured cells, ARF 5 preferentially hybridized with a 1.3-kb mRNA, whereas ARF 6 hybridized with 1.8- and 4.2-kb mRNAs. The fact that the sizes of these mRNAs are similar to those of other ARFs (ARF 1, 1.9 kb; ARF 2, 2.6 kb; ARF 3, approximately 3.8 and 1.3 kb; ARF 4, 1.8 kb) explain the previously observed inconsistencies between the cDNA and ARF-specific oligonucleotide hybridization patterns. All six ARF cDNAs are more similar to each other than to other approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1587837383,"Mammalian cells accumulate iron via the binding of transferrin to high affinity surface receptors, or through a transferrin-independent pathway which involves the uptake of iron-organic anion chelates by a membrane-based transport system. Previously we determined that the transferrin-independent transport system was present on a wide variety of cultured cells (Sturrock, A., Alexander, J., Lamb, J., Craven, C. M., and Kaplan, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3139-3145). In this communication we demonstrate that the transferrin-independent iron uptake system is regulated differently than the transferrin-mediated pathway. The activity of the transferrin-independent system was unaffected by changes in cellular growth rate, induction of DNA synthesis and cell division, or depletion of cellular iron. Exposure of cells to ferric or ferrous iron, however, resulted in a time-dependent increase in transport activity, due to a change in Vmax with no change in Km. Increased transport activity was seen in a variety of cultured cell types, occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, and persisted for hours after removal of iron. The ability of other transition metals to induce changes in transport, or to compete with iron for accumulation by the transferrin-independent uptake system, was critically dependent on the composition of the media in which the cells were incubated. Metals such as Cu2+ or Zn2+, but not Cd2+ or Mn2+, when dissolved in a balanced salt solution buffered with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, induced changes in the transferrin-independent iron transport system. The same metals which induced changes in transport were ineffective in media containing amino acids, ascorbate, or N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. The Vmax of the transferrin-independent iron transport system was also elevated by increases in intracellular Ca2+. The effect of iron on transport activity, however, did not result from an iron-induced release of intracellular Ca2+. These results suggest a novel form of regulation in which the presence of extracellular iron induces the appearance of previously cryptic transporters and thus accelerates the clearance of potentially toxic molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1535142102,"Messenger RNAs coding for cytokines and lymphokines are extremely unstable due to an AU-rich cis element located in their 3'-untranslated region. Cell activation with phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or calcium ionophore has been shown to markedly stabilize these normally labile messages. We have recently described a cytoplasmic protein, denoted the adenosine-uridine binding factor (AUBF) which complexes in vitro to a variety of labile RNAs containing multiple reiterations of the pentamer AUUUA. In order to determine if AUBF plays a role in the stabilization of cytokine and lymphokine mRNAs, we have investigated the mechanisms which control AUBF activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as Jurkat cells. AUBF is inactive in resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells but can be activated by brief treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or ionophore. Up-regulation is independent of protein synthesis or RNA transcription, suggesting pre-existing AUBF is subject to post-translational modification. AUBF activity can be reversibly blocked by diamide but irreversibly inhibited by n-ethylmaleimide, suggesting that AUBF contains a redox switch as described for other RNA-binding proteins. Finally, AUBF activity is abolished by potato acid phosphatase, demonstrating that AUBF is a phosphoprotein. These data demonstrate that AUBF activity is subject to at least two levels of post-translational regulation and is enhanced by mitogens previously shown to induce the stabilization of AUUUA mRNAs. Based upon these data, we propose that AUBF binding may mediate 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and ionophore-mediated labile message stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2035791207,"Different neuronal populations were used to compare the neurite outgrowth-promoting activities of N-CAM and N-cadherin expressed via gene transfer on the surface of nonneuronal cells. In contrast to a previously reported developmental loss of retinal ganglion cell responsiveness to N-CAM, these cells exhibited an increased and maintained responsiveness to N-cadherin over the same developmental period (E6-E11). N-CAM and N-cadherin responses could be specifically inhibited by their own antibodies, but not by antisera to the beta 1 integrin family or the L1/G4 glycoprotein. Cerebellar neurons showed qualitative differences in the nature of the dose-response curves for transfected N-CAM expression (highly cooperative) versus N-cadherin expression (linear). In addition ""subthreshold"" levels of N-CAM expression, which do not normally support neurite outgrowth, did so when coexpressed with functional levels of N-cadherin. These studies show fundamental differences in neuronal responsiveness to cell adhesion molecules and suggest a more dynamic regulation for N-CAM-dependent neurite outgrowth than for N-cadherin-dependent outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W1501578776,"Phospholipids are the major components of pulmonary surfactant. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is believed to be especially essential for the surfactant function of reducing the surface tension at the air-liquid interface. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) with a reduced denatured molecular mass of 26-38 kDa, characterized by a collagen-like structure and N-linked glycosylation, interacts strongly with a mixture of surfactant-like phospholipids. In the present study the direct binding of SP-A to phospholipids on a thin layer chromatogram was visualized using 125I-SP-A as a probe, so that the phospholipid specificities of SP-A binding and the structural requirements of SP-A and phospholipids for the binding could be examined. Although 125I-SP-A bound phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyeline, it was especially strong in binding dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, but failed to bind phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. Labeled SP-A also exhibited strong binding to distearoylphosphatidylcholine, but weak binding to dimyristoyl-, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-, and dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine. Unlabeled SP-A readily competed with labeled SP-A for phospholipid binding. SP-A strongly bound dipalmitoylglycerol produced by phospholipase C treatment of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, but not palmitic acid. This protein also failed to bind lysophosphatidylcholine produced by phospholipase A2 treatment of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. 125I-SP-A shows almost no binding to dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol and dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. The addition of 10 mM EGTA into the binding buffer reduced much of the 125I-SP-A binding to phospholipids. Excess deglycosylated SP-A competed with labeled SP-A for binding to dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, but the excess collagenase-resistant fragment of SP-A failed. From these data we conclude that 1) SP-A specifically and strongly binds dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 2) SP-A binds the nonpolar group of phospholipids, 3) the second positioned palmitate is involved in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine binding, and 4) the specificities of polar groups of dipalmitoylglycerophospholipids also appear to be important for SP-A binding, 5) the phospholipid binding activity of SP-A is dependent upon calcium ions and the integrity of the collagenous domain of SP-A, but not on the oligosaccharide moiety of SP-A. SP-A may play an important role in the regulation of recycling and intra- and extracellular movement of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W1510827000,"The in vitro phosphorylation by [gamma-32P]ATP of a 34-kDa plasma membrane-associated protein (pp34) from tomato and potato is strongly enhanced in the presence of alpha-1,4-D-polygalacturonic acid (PGA) fragments (Farmer, E. E., Pearce, G., and Ryan, C. A. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 1539-1542) that activate the expression of defensive and developmental genes in plant tissues. [gamma-35S]ATP, but not [gamma-35S]GTP, has now been found to strongly label pp34 in the presence of the PGA fragments. PGA-enhanced phosphorylation of pp34 is at one or more threonine residue(s) and therefore is the product of a serine/threonine kinase. alpha-1,4-L-Polyguluronic acid (PGU) enhances thiophosphorylation of pp34, but is less effective than PGA. beta-1,4-D-Polymannuronic acid (PMA) is inactive. In vivo synthesis of proteinase inhibitors in tomato leaves in response to PGA, PGU, and PMA parallels enhancing activities in in vitro phosphorylation assays. The minimum oligogalacturonide lengths that enhance in vitro thiophosphorylation of pp34 are about 14-15 residues, which are near the minimum sizes of uronides required to elicit a variety of localized defensive and developmental responses in plants. The lengths of biologically active galacturonic acid oligomers are of the same length that form strong intermolecular complexes in solution with Ca2+. Uronide-Ca2+ complexes are proposed to be the active molecular species that initiate the signal transduction pathways regulating uronide-responsive genes."
https://openalex.org/W2036320267,"Opioid receptors were found to activate two different types of membrane potassium conductance in acutely dissociated neurons from the CA1/subiculum regions of the adult rat hippocampal formation. Opioid-responsive neurons were distinguished based on their morphology and electrophysiological responses. In one population of neurons having a multipolar, nonpyramidal cell shape, mu-selective opioid agonists increased an inward rectifying potassium current. Opioid activation of the inward rectifying conductance resulted in small outward potassium currents at resting membrane potentials and increased inward currents at hyperpolarized potentials. In a second population of nonpyramidal neurons, mu opioid agonists increased a novel voltage-gated potassium current. This current was blocked by internal CsCl2, unaffected by external BaCl2 or CdCl2, irreversibly activated by intracellular GTP-gamma-S, and inactivated by sustained depolarization. In contrast to the inward rectifying conductance, the voltage-gated conductance was not activated at resting membrane potentials or hyperpolarized potentials. The opioid-activated, voltage-gated conductance represents a new class of G protein-regulated potassium current in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1483519977,"A polyadenylate polymerase involved in the polyadenylation of pre-mRNA has been purified 6,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from extracts of calf thymus. In the last purification step, anion exchange chromatography separates the enzyme into three major peaks that are indistinguishable by other physical or functional criteria. On denaturing polyacrylamide gels, the two predominant forms of poly(A) polymerase have molecular weights of 57,000 and 60,000. In solution, the enzyme is a monomer. It polymerizes exclusively ATP. The reaction is distributive and proceeds linearly without any lag phase. The requirement for a primer can be satisfied by any of a number of polyribonucleotides. A significantly higher activity in the presence of Mn2+ as opposed to Mg2+ is due to a hundredfold higher affinity for the primer terminus. In the presence of mg2+ and of a specificity factor partially purified from HeLa cells, the enzyme specifically polyadenylates an RNA that ends at the natural adenovirus L3 polyadenylation site. This reaction depends on the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal."
https://openalex.org/W1501315577,"Class A beta-lactamases are known to hydrolyze substrates through a Ser70-linked acyl-enzyme intermediate, although the detailed mechanism remains unknown. On the basis of the tertiary structure of the active site, the role of Glu166 of class A enzymes was investigated by replacing the residue in RTEM-1 beta-lactamase with Ala, Asp, Gln, or Asn. All the mutants, in contrast to the wild-type, accumulated a covalent complex with benzylpenicillin which corresponds to an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For the Asp mutant, the complex decayed slowly and the hydrolytic activity was slightly retained both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, the other mutants lost the hydrolytic activity completely and their complexes were stable. These results indicate that the side-chain carboxylate of Glu166 acts as a special catalyst for deacylation. Residues for deacylation have not been identified in other acyl enzymes, such as serine proteases and class C beta-lactamases. Furthermore, the acyl-enzyme intermediates obtained are so stable that they are considered to be ideal materials for crystallographic studies for elucidating the catalytic mechanism in more detail. In addition, the mutants can more easily form inclusion bodies than the wild-type, when they are produced in a large amount, suggesting that the residue also plays an important role in proper folding of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1537838130,"The tet(M) tetracycline resistance gene has been found in a wide variety of clinically important bacteria. It has been shown previously (Burdett, V. (1986) J. Bacteriol. 165, 564-569) that the tet(M) gene product mediates resistance at the level of protein synthesis as judged by in vitro assay. Using this assay, large amounts of protein were purified from an Escherichia coli overproducer expressing the gene under control of a T7 promoter. The purified activity consists of a single polypeptide of molecular weight 68,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and was confirmed to be the tet(M) gene product by amino-terminal sequence analysis. Purified Tet(M) has an associated ribosome-dependent GTPase with the specific activity being similar to that of the corresponding activity associated with elongation factor G. Since Tet(M) also displays substantial homology to elongation factor G throughout its length, Tet(M) may function as an analog of this elongation factor."
https://openalex.org/W1480692165,"We developed antibodies pG1 and pG2 which recognize glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in its phosphorylated state. Antibodies pG1 and pG2 were produced against two synthetic peptides, Arg-Arg-Arg-Val-Thr-phosphoSer-Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg-phosphoSer (residues 3-13) and Pro-Gly-Pro-Arg-Leu-phosphoSer-Leu-Ala-Arg-Met-Pro (residues 29-39), respectively. The phosphorylation of these serine residues on the intact GFAP induces disassembly of glial filaments in vitro (Inagaki, M., Gonda, Y., Nishizawa, K., Kitamura, S., Sato, C., Ando, S., Tanabe, K., Kikuchi, K., Tsuiki, S., and Nishi, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4722-4729). Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies demonstrate that both antibodies react specifically with mitotic astroglial cells, thereby supporting the notion that increased phosphorylation during mitosis may directly influence intracellular organization of the glial filaments. The specific distribution pattern of the phosphoGFAP in the mitotic cells reveals that site-specific phosphorylation events may make way for the locally controlled breakdown of glial filaments in the constricted area, before the final separation of daughter cells."
https://openalex.org/W1558461916,"The suicidal inactivation mechanism of DNA repair methyltransferases (MTases) was exploited to measure the relative efficiencies with which the Escherichia coli, human, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA MTases repair O6-methylguanine (O6MeG) and O4-methylthymine (O4MeT), two of the DNA lesions produced by mutagenic and carcinogenic alkylating agents. Using chemically synthesized double-stranded 25-base pair oligodeoxynucleotides containing a single O6MeG or a single O4MeT, the concentration of O6MeG or O4MeT substrate that produced 50% inactivation (IC50) was determined for each of four MTases. The E. coli ogt gene product had a relatively high affinity for the O6MeG substrate (IC50 8.1 nM) but had an even higher affinity for the O4MeT substrate (IC50 3 nM). By contrast, the E. coli Ada MTase displayed a striking preference for O6MeG (IC50 1.25 nM) as compared to O4MeT (IC50 27.5 nM). Both the human and the yeast DNA MTases were efficiently inactivated upon incubation with the O6MeG-containing oligomer (IC50 values of 1.5 and 1.3 nM, respectively). Surprisingly, the human and yeast MTases were also inactivated by the O4MeT-containing oligomer albeit at IC50 values of 29.5 and 44 nM, respectively. This result suggests that O4MeT lesions can be recognized in this substrate by eukaryotic DNA MTases but the exact biochemical mechanism of methyltransferase inactivation remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1573834280,"Nitroxides were used as models of persistent free radicals to study the antioxidant function of ascorbic acid in the human erythrocyte. It was concluded that: 1) ascorbate and other reductant(s) derived from dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) in the presence of thiols are the only significant reducing agents for nitroxides, 2) glutathione and DHA reduce nitroxides by a process that cannot be inhibited by ascorbic acid oxidase, 3) erythrocytes can be depleted of ascorbic acid by exhaustive washing in the presence of membrane-permeable cationic nitroxides such as N,N-dimethylamino-Tempo, 4) ascorbate-depleted cells do not reduce nitroxides; however, nitroxide reduction is restored when the cells are incubated with DHA, 5) reduction of nitroxides in ascorbate-depleted, DHA-treated cells is significantly faster than in buffered solutions of DHA and glutathione, 6) several equivalents of nitroxide are reduced relative to the intracellular ascorbate pool, 7) sustained nitroxide reduction is observed even when most of the intracellular ascorbate is oxidized, 8) spin trapping of oxyradicals in tert-butyl hydroperoxide-treated cells is accelerated with ascorbate depletion and inhibited with ascorbate loading, 9) ascorbate can be quantified within intact cells by analyzing the initial reduction rates of membrane-permeable cationic nitroxides, and 10) DHA-stimulated reduction of cationic nitroxides is slower and less extensive in erythrocytes deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase than in normal erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1655615273,"Mitochondrial NAD(+)-dependent malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) is expressed in rapidly proliferating cells and tumor cells, where it is probably linked to the conversion of amino acid carbon to pyruvate. In this paper, we report the cDNA cloning, amino acid sequence, and expression in Escherichia coli of functional human NAD(+)-dependent mitochondrial malic enzyme. The cDNA is 1,923 base pairs long and contains an open reading frame coding for a 584-amino acid protein. The molecular mass is 65.4 kDa for the unprocessed precursor protein. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the human protein with the published NADP(+)-dependent mammalian cytosolic or plant chloroplast malic enzymes reveals highly conserved regions interrupted with long stretches of amino acids without significant homology. Expression of the processed protein in E. coli yielded an enzyme with the same kinetic and allosteric properties as malic enzyme purified from human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1510533371,"Cell-free protein synthesizing systems prepared from heat-shocked Ehrlich cells retain the inhibition of translation that is seen at the cellular level. Recently, we showed that a highly purified cap-binding protein complex composed of the p220 and p28 subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F, in a 1:1 molar ratio, restores protein synthesis in these cell-free translation systems (Lamphear, B.J., and Panniers, R. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5333-5336). Here we have estimated the amount of cap-binding complex in cell extracts that can restore protein synthesis in heat-shocked cells. We find reduced restoring activity in heat-shocked cell extracts. Further, less cap-binding complex can be purified by 7-methyl-guanosine triphosphate Sepharose affinity chromatography from heat-shocked cell extracts, and we conclude that heat shock impairs the binding of complex to 5' mRNA cap. We have ruled out proteolysis and competitive inhibitors as mediators of this impairment. However we cannot distinguish between two possible explanations: (i) reduced association of p220 with p28 or (ii) a non-competitive inhibitor blocks complex binding to cap. We have also examined the affect of heat shock on the phosphorylation state of two forms of p28, p220.p28 complex and p28 free of p220. Both forms have reduced levels of phosphorylation during heat shock. The significance of these changes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2079052139,Unusually large electric field effects have been measured for the absorption spectra of carotenoids (spheroidene) in the B800-850 light-harvesting complex from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Quantitative analysis shows that the difference in the permanent dipole moment between the ground state and excited states in this protein complex is substantially larger than for pure spheroidene extracted from the protein. The results demonstrate the presence of a large perturbation on the electronic structure of this nearly symmetric carotenoid due to the organized environment in the protein. This work also provides an explanation for the seemingly anomalous dependence of carotenoid band shifts on transmembrane potential and a generally useful approach for calibrating electric field-sensitive dyes that are widely used to probe potentials in biological systems.
https://openalex.org/W1493905101,"The relationships between receptor-mediated endocytosis and the generation of intracellular signals were analyzed in angiotensin II (AII)-stimulated adrenal glomerulosa cells. In cells equilibrated with 125I-AII analogs at 4 degrees C, specifically bound agonist but not antagonist AII derivatives were rapidly internalized at 37 degrees C. AII-induced internalization was not influenced by the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ but was inhibited by treatment with phenylarsine oxide (PAO) or by arresting coated pit formation with hypotonic shock and potassium depletion. Inhibition of internalization by PAO was prevented by the bifunctional sulfhydryl reagent dithiothreitol but only partially reversed by mercaptoethanol, and readdition of K+ restored internalization in K(+)-depleted cells. Treatment with PAO did not impair the initial AII-induced elevations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and cytoplasmic calcium [( Ca2+]i) but reduced the sustained phase of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 response by 85% and abolished the second phase of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ response; these responses were restored by concomitant treatment with dithiothreitol. Inhibition of AII-receptor internalization by K+ depletion also caused selective loss of the sustained phase of the AII-induced Ca2+ response. Thus, blockade of AII-receptor internalization has similar effects as extracellular Ca2+ deficiency, which abolishes the sustained but not the early AII-induced increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production and [Ca2+]i. The close correlations between AII-induced internalization and the generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [Ca2+]i responses suggest that endocytosis of the agonist-receptor complex is necessary to maintain the production of these intracellular signals. It is also possible that receptor-operated vesicular uptake of extracellular Ca2+ makes a significant contribution to the sustained [Ca2+]i responses of certain agonist-stimulated target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1871517724,"We report the complete amino acid sequence of bovine conglutinin obtained by structural characterization of peptides derived from the protein by various chemical and enzymatic fragmentation methods. The protein consists of 351 amino acid residues including 55 apparent Gly-X-Y repeats with two interruptions. This 171-residue-long collagenous domain separates a short noncollagenous NH2-terminal region of 25 residues from the 155-residue-long globular COOH terminus revealing the structural relation of conglutinin with mannose-binding proteins, pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins, and a complement component C1q. Eight hydroxylysine residues were found in the collagenous domain. All of these hydroxylysine residues which occupy a Y position in a Gly-X-Y triplet are possible glycosylation sites since no phenylthiohydantoin amino acid was identified in automated Edman degradation cycles corresponding to these sites. The noncollagenous COOH domain of conglutinin, on the other hand, contains a carbohydrate recognition domain which shares substantial sequence homology with C-type animal lectins. Conglutinin has the greatest sequence similarity with mannose-binding proteins and pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1578217982,"Three toxic polypeptides were purified from the venom of the Brazilian scorpion Tityus serrulatus by means of gel filtration in Sephadex G-50 and ion-exchange chromatography in carboxymethylcellulose. The peptides are basic molecules with molecular weights in the range of 7000 for which the amino acid compositions and sequences were determined. The effect of the purified peptides on pancreatic exocrine secretion in the guinea pig was studied. Biochemical measurements show that the cells are stimulated by these peptides to discharge their zymogen granules. Light and electron microscopic images confirm the biochemical measurements. At the light microscope level, acinar cells show dramatically fewer zymogen granules than in control pancreas with the appearance of large vacuoles and some loss of morphological integrity. Electron micrographs display apical regions devoid of zymogen granules and condensing vacuoles whereas acinar lumina contain crystalline secretory material. The secretory effect observed in vitro is comparable to that of carbamylcholine and that of the peptidergic secretagogue cholecystokinin-pancreozymin."
https://openalex.org/W1496474165,"The octamer motif (ATTTGCAT) is an important regulatory element in eukaryotic gene expression. A previously unidentified protein that recognizes this motif has been isolated from the human B cell line, Daudi. The protein, which we term Ku-2, bears a close resemblance to the DNA-binding autoantigen Ku. Like Ku, it is a heterodimer with subunits of 83 and 72 kDa; antisera raised against either subunit of Ku cross-react with Ku-2. Two peptides have been sequenced and show a strong similarity to regions in the corresponding subunits of Ku. The sequences are not identical, however, suggesting that Ku-2 may be a B cell homologue of Ku. Both Ku and Ku-2 bind to the termini of DNA duplexes, but Ku-2 also binds to an internal octamer motif. It is not known whether Ku shares the latter property or whether the octamer binding is a consequence of sequence differences between the two proteins. Ku-2 does not react with antisera against the POU domain of the octamer-binding protein Oct-2, indicating that the DNA binding domains of the two proteins are dissimilar despite the ability of both to bind to the octamer motif. We discuss the evidence for the existence of a family of octamer-binding proteins related to Ku."
https://openalex.org/W1482720254,"Recombinant fibronectin (FN) fragments and their mutant proteins were produced to elucidate the role of type III homology repeats in cell adhesive activity within the cell-binding domain of FN. Cell adhesive activity of the 11.5-kDa fragment, the cell attachment site of the cell-binding domain, was less than 0.1% that of native FN despite the presence of the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser sequence. The activity increased as type III homology repeats were added to the N terminus of the 11.5-kDa fragment, and a 52-kDa fragment with four additional type III repeats had almost the same activity of native FN. Deletion of Arg-Gly-Asp from the fully active fragments completely abolished the cell adhesive activity. Deletion of one or two repeats from the 52-kDa fragment affected the extent of the cell adhesive activity, the degree of the effect being inversely correlated with the distance of the deletion from the type III repeat containing Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser. Rearrangement of type III repeats caused much loss of activity. These results suggest that the number and kinds of type III repeats and their correct alignment rather than the putative synergistic site decide the extent of the specific cell adhesive activity."
https://openalex.org/W1537337303,"Eukaryotic initiation factor 4F, a multi-protein mRNA cap binding complex, was isolated by m7GTP-Sepharose affinity chromatography from human mammary epithelial cells (184A1N4) incubated with [32P] orthophosphate. Treatment of cells with epidermal growth factor resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of both p28 (eIF-4E) and p220 subunits. The identities of the p28 and p220 subunits were confirmed by immunoprecipitation. The phosphorylation was both rapid and sustained in duration; p28 attained maximal levels (2-3-fold) within 30 min of treatment and remained elevated for at least 2 h, while p220 reached one-half maximal levels by 30 min, and maximal levels (3-4-fold) by 2 h of treatment. Two phosphorylated isoforms of p28 and multiple phosphorylated forms of p220 were detected by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphoamino acid analysis of 6 N HCl hydrolyzates of p28 and p220 isolated from epidermal growth factor-treated and control cells indicated that serine is the predominant phosphorylated amino acid in both instances. In no case was phosphotyrosine observed. Pretreatment of cells with 1 microM okadaic acid resulted in the hyperphosphorylation of both p28 and p220 subunits. These results suggest that mitogenic growth factors and cellular serine/threonine phosphatases (pp1 and/or pp2A) serve essential roles in regulating phosphorylation levels of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F and support the concept that translational control is a component of the signal transduction mechanisms involved in growth regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1939119178,"Mutation of a small number of amino acids in the DNA-binding domain of the estrogen receptor to the corresponding sequence of the glucocorticoid receptor switches the specificity of the receptor in transactivation assays (Mader, S., Kumar, V., de Verneuil, H., and Chambon, P. (1989) Nature 338, 271-274). We have made the corresponding reciprocal mutations in the context of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domain and studied the binding of wild type and mutant purified proteins to palindromic glucocorticoid and estrogen response elements as well as to elements of intermediate sequence, using gel mobility shift assays. We show here that a protein with two altered amino acids binds glucocorticoid and estrogen response elements with a low but equal affinity, whereas a protein with an additional changed residue has a high affinity for estrogen response elements but still retains a considerable affinity for glucocorticoid response elements. Using binding sites of intermediate sequence we have further characterized the interaction with DNA. The in vitro DNA binding results are confirmed by in vivo transactivation assays in yeast. Finally we suggest a testable model for amino acid/base pair interactions involved in recognition by the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domain of its target sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1574903262,"We have demonstrated previously that the carboxyl- and amino-terminal propeptides of type I procollagen can inhibit procollagen synthesis by specifically decreasing procollagen mRNA levels. The objective of the present experiments was to determine the mechanism by which propeptides cause these pretranslational effects. IMR-90 fibroblasts were exposed to medium containing carboxyl-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen, and nuclear run-off assays were performed by hybridization to a specific alpha 1 chain type I procollagen cDNA probe. Specific type I procollagen transcription rates were found to be decreased by 50% in the presence of 75 nM carboxyl-terminal propeptide compared with control (untreated) cells. Total cellular transcription rates as well as beta-actin mRNA rates were not affected significantly by any concentration of carboxyl-terminal propeptide. Propeptide radiolabeled with 125I was found to be taken up by cultured cells. Furthermore, exogenous carboxyl-terminal propeptide levels increased in the cytosolic compartment and eventually reached a steady-state level of 18 +/- 2 pmol/g cell protein by 30 min. Of particular interest was the finding that levels of radiolabeled carboxyl-terminal propeptide were also detected in the nuclear fraction and increased with time, reaching a plateau after 60 min of incubation. Incubation of nuclei from IMR-90 cells in medium containing varying concentrations of carboxyl-terminal propeptide resulted in nuclear transcription rates that were decreased by 40% compared with untreated controls. beta-Actin nuclear message levels remained unchanged under identical conditions. We conclude that carboxyl-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen can be internalized and become associated with the nuclear compartment. This suggests a feedback regulatory role on procollagen synthesis by a direct effect on procollagen gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1520237714,"The slow dissociation reaction of the tubulin-colchicine complex has been characterized in purified calf brain tubulin and microtubule protein preparations, using [3H]colchicine and fluorometric measurements. It fits to a single exponential phase, within the accuracy of these measurements. The dissociation is a kinetically unfavorable reaction, with activation energy values of 114 +/- 10 and 94 +/- 10 kJ mol-1 (purified tubulin and microtubule protein, respectively). The kinetic scheme previously proposed for the tubulin-colchicine association (Lambeir, A., and Engelborghs, Y. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3279-3282) is: T + C K1 in equilibrium TC k2 in equilibrium k-2 (TC)' where step 1 is a fast reversible binding and step 2 is a slow conformational change, whose backward rate constant (k-2) was neglected for the association study. This kinetic scheme has now been completed to include the measurements of the rate-limiting dissociation step (k-2), and of the purified calf brain tubulin preparation. The overall binding standard free energy change, calculated from the kinetic measurements, is -42.0 +/- 0.1 kJ mol-1 (fast phase of binding in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 0.1 mM GTP, pH 7.0, at 37 degrees C). The binding is exothermic and the calculated enthalpy change is -26 +/- 13 kJ mol-1, which coincides with the recently determined calorimetric enthalpy value, -21 +/- 2 kJ mol-1 (Menendez, M., Laynez, J., Medrano, F. J., and Andreu, J. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16367-16371), suggesting that the kinetic scheme and measurements are essentially correct."
https://openalex.org/W1556331886,"We have prepared plasma membranes from Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts to study the transmodulation of the high affinity epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Although phorbol esters do not transmodulate the high affinity EGF receptors on these membranes, the addition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or EGF to the membranes leads to the loss of high affinity EGF binding and to the phosphorylation of several membrane proteins, including the EGF receptor. The EGF receptor is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues although we have not yet established if this represents direct phosphorylation by the PDGF receptor kinase or is mediated by activation of other cell membrane-associated tyrosine kinases. Upon treatment of the membranes with PDGF, four major phosphoproteins (of apparent molecular masses of 69, 56, 38, and 28 kDa) are released from the membrane and can be retrieved from the supernatant fluid using a reversed-phase cartridge. As assessed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, all four proteins appear to be phosphorylated on tyrosine. The time course of dissociation of these proteins from the membranes closely parallels the loss of high affinity EGF receptors. The high affinity EGF receptor can be reconstituted on PDGF-transmodulated membranes by treating the supernatant fluid with alkaline phosphatase and adding the mixture to the membranes. It appears that dephosphorylation of the released proteins is sufficient to allow reassociation with the membranes and formation of the high affinity EGF receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W2128367215,"DNA methyltransferases can be photolabeled with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). Specific incorporation of radioactivity has been demonstrated after photolabeling with either [methyl-3H]AdoMet or [35S]AdoMet (Som, S., and Friedman, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4278-4283). The labeling is believed to occur at the AdoMet binding site. With the purpose of localizing the site responsible for [methyl-3H]AdoMet photolabeling, we cleaved the labeled EcoRII methyltransferase by chemical and enzymatic reactions and isolated the radiolabeled peptides by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography. The labeled peptides were identified by amino-terminal sequencing. A common region was localized which accounted for 65-70% of the total label. This region includes a highly conserved core sequence present in all DNA (cytosine 5)-methyltransferases. One such fragment was digested further with chymotrypsin, and amino acid analysis of the resulting 3H-labeled peptide was consistent with the sequence Ala-Gly-Phe-Pro-(Cys)-Gln-Pro-Phe-Ser-Leu. However, the cysteine residue was not recovered as carboxymethylcysteine. The Pro-Cys bond was found to be protected from cleavage at cysteine residues after cyanylation. These results suggest that the cysteine residue is modified by the labeling reaction. The chymotryptic fragment was hydrolyzed enzymatically to single amino acids, and the labeled amino acid was identified as S-methylcysteine by thin layer chromatography. These results indicate that the cysteine residue is located at or close to the AdoMet binding site of EcoRII methyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1598844341,"Familial defective apoB-100 is a genetic mutation that is characterized by abnormal low density lipoprotein (LDL) and moderate hypercholesterolemia. Heterozygotes for this disorder possess two populations of LDL. One has normal receptor binding, and the other, which can be isolated by monoclonal antibody 19 immunoaffinity chromatography, has almost no binding activity. The mutation that disrupts binding is a Gln for Arg substitution of apoB-100 residue 3500. NMR spectra of LDL containing (13CH3)2Lys residues show that chemically modified Lys exist in two microenvironments. In normal human LDL, there are about 50 Lys with pK 8.9 and 170 Lys with pK 10.5; an upper limit of 10 pK 8.9 Lys may be particularly involved in binding to the LDL receptor. Examination of the mixture of normal LDL and mutant LDL from five patients shows that the latter have fewer pK 8.9 Lys. In purified defective LDL at least seven Lys are redistributed from the active to normal pool. The CD spectra of mutant and normal LDL are identical. Therefore, substitution of Gln for Arg at position 3500 induces a change in local conformation which disrupts the receptor-binding domain of apoB-100."
https://openalex.org/W1603469396,"A new D-mannose/D-glucose-specific lectin (B-SJA-II) was isolated from the bark of the Japanese pagoda tree, Sophora japonica. B-SJA-II was separated from a well known D-galactose/N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific lectin (B-SJA-I) by affinity chromatography on lactamyl-Sepharose, then purified by affinity chromatography on maltamyl-Sepharose. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, B-SJA-II gave four bands: subunit a-1 (Mr = 19,400), a-2 (Mr = 18,200), b-1 (Mr = 15,000), and b-2 (Mr = 13,200). Carbohydrate analysis and binding study with horseradish peroxidase-labeled lectins on the bands electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane showed that the three subunits other than b-2 have N-linked oligosaccharides typical of plant glycoproteins. The binding assay with horseradish peroxidase-glycoproteins revealed that all the subunits can bind sugar specifically with fetuin and asialofetuin. Furthermore, B-SJA-II aggregated to form precipitates in the absence of a specific sugar and became soluble upon addition of the specific sugar. The results indicate that each subunit has a sugar-binding site for the mannosyl core of N-linked oligosaccharide chains and recognizes each other sugar specifically to form aggregates. According to the N-terminal amino acid sequences obtained, the subunits are classified into two groups. The first group (a-1 and a-2) has an N-terminal sequence 50% identical with that of other S. japonica lectins (Hankins, C. N., Kindinger, J. I., and Shannon, L. M. (1988) Plant Physiol. 86, 67-70) and the amino acid sequence initiating at position 123 of concanavalin A (Cunningham, B. (1975) J. Biol.

As a result of these changes both the cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio and the cytosolic phosphorylation potential are significantly lowered while no changes are detected in either the cytosolic NADP+/NADPH ratio or the mitochondrial NAD+/NADH ratio. These hepatic changes are accompanied by marked increases in the circulating concentrations of lactate, non-esterified fatty acids, and triacylglycerols. The activities of both liver hexokinase and phosphofructokinase are also significantly elevated in the tumor-bearing rats. The changes observed both in the redox state and phosphorylation potential are in agreement with the energy imbalance associated with tumor burden."

https://openalex.org/W1547646031,"The metabolic conversion of dicarboxylic acids into succinate and other gluconeogenic intermediates in rat liver homogenates was investigated using [1,2,4-13C4]dodecanedioic acid as tracer. Isotope enrichments in 3-hydroxybutyrate, succinate, fumarate, and malate, as well as dicarboxylates (dodecanedioic, sebacic, suberic, and adipic acids) were measured with selected ion monitoring capillary column gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Significant enrichment in the M + 4 (four labeled carbons) ion of succinate (0.4-2.9%) was detected, unequivocally demonstrating the direct conversion of dicarboxylate into succinate. In addition, significant enrichment of the M + 2 ion of succinate was also observed. This labeled species was generated from labeled acetyl-CoA through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The partition of acetyl-CoA into the tricarboxylic acid cycle relative to ketone body formation was higher in the beta oxidation of dicarboxylate than monocarboxylate. Therefore, in addition to the production of succinate, the beta oxidation of dodecanedioate resulted in the channeling of the acetyl-CoA produced to the tricarboxylic acid cycle instead of to acetoacetate production. The enrichments in lower chain dicarboxylates are consistent with a partial bidirectional beta oxidation of dodecanedioic acid. In addition to the expected M + 0 and M + 4 labels, significant M + 2 species were detected in suberic and adipic acids. These M + 2-labeled species were produced from the released free dicarboxylate intermediates which were then reactivated and metabolized. In these experiments, the overall succinate production was derived 4% from the direct conversion of dodecanedioic acid and 11% from the indirect route via acetyl-CoA through tricarboxylic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1602925655,"Initial velocity studies in the absence and presence of product and dead-end inhibitors suggest a steady-state random mechanism for malic enzyme in the direction of reductive carboxylation of pyruvate. For this quadreactant enzymatic reaction (Mn2+ is a pseudoreactant), initial velocity patterns were obtained under conditions in which two substrates were maintained at saturating concentrations while one reactant was varied at several fixed concentrations of the other. Data from the resulting reciprocal plots, analyzed in terms of a bireactant mechanism, are consistent with a sequential mechanism with an obligatory order of addition of metal prior to pyruvate. NAD is competitive against NADH whether pyruvate and CO2 are maintained at low or high concentrations, whereas it is noncompetitive against pyruvate and CO2. Thio-NADH, alpha-ketobutyrate, and nitrite were used as dead-end analogs of NADH, pyruvate, and CO2, respectively. Thio-NADH is competitive against NADH, whereas it is noncompetitive against pyruvate and CO2, in accordance with a random mechanism. alpha-Ketobutyrate and nitrite gave noncompetitive inhibition against all substrates. The noncompetitive patterns observed for alpha-ketobutyrate versus pyruvate and nitrite versus CO2 suggest binding of the inhibitor to both the E.Mn.NADH and E.Mn.NAD complexes. Primary deuterium isotope effects are equal on all kinetic parameters, in agreement with the random mechanism, and suggest equal off-rates for NAD from E.Mn.NAD as well as pyruvate and NADH from E.Mn.NADH.pyruvate. Data are consistent with an overall symmetry in the malic enzyme reaction in the two reaction directions with a requirement for metal bound prior to pyruvate and malate."

The sequence of the cDNA predicts a protein of 295 amino acids with a molecular weight of 33,355. The sequence reveals two EF-hand calcium-binding regions that provide a structural explanation for calcium regulation of the activity of this protein. The putative calcium-binding region of the 30,000-dalton protein has similarity to sequences of other calcium-regulated actin-binding proteins such as alpha-actin and fimbrin. One region of the sequence with similarity to both Dictyostelium gelation factor (ABP 120) and fructose bisphosphate aldolase is a potential actin-binding sequence. A highly charged region of the protein is similar to a sequence in human cytovillin that is repeated eight times in chicken gizzard caldesmon. No strong homology to previously identified actin-binding sequences of other actin-binding proteins is apparent. Results from Southern blot experiments indicate that the 30,000-dalton protein is encoded by a single gene in the Dictyostelium genome."

https://openalex.org/W1509191323,"We measured hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, mass, and catalytic efficiency (activity/unit mass) in bile fistula rats infused intraduodenally with taurocholate and its 7 beta-hydroxy epimer, tauroursocholate, with or without mevalonolactone to supply newly synthesized cholesterol. Enzyme activity was measured by an isotope incorporation assay and enzyme mass by densitometric scanning of immunoblots using rabbit anti-rat liver cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase antisera. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity increased 6-fold, enzyme mass 34%, and catalytic efficiency 5-fold after interruption of the enterohepatic circulation for 48 h. When taurocholate was infused to the bile acid-depleted animals at a rate equivalent to the hepatic bile acid flux (27 mumol/100-g rat/h), cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and enzyme mass declined 60 and 61%, respectively. Tauroursocholate did not significantly decrease cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, mass and catalytic efficiency. The administration of mevalonolactone, which is converted to cholesterol, modestly increased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and enzyme mass in the bile acid-depleted rats. However, when taurocholate was infused together with mevalonolactone, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and catalytic efficiency were markedly depressed while enzyme mass did not change as compared with bile acid-depleted rats. These results show that (a) hepatic bile acid depletion increases bile acid synthesis mainly by activating cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase with only a small rise in enzyme mass, (b) replacement with taurocholate for 24 h decreases both cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and mass proportionally, (c) when cholesterol is available (mevalonolactone supplementation), the infusion of taurocholate results in the formation of a catalytically less active cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, and (d) tauroursocholate, the 7 beta-hydroxy epimer of taurocholate, does not inhibit cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. Thus, bile acid synthesis is modulated by the catalytic efficiency and mass of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. The enterohepatic flux of 7 alpha-hydroxylated bile acids and the formation of hepatic cholesterol apparently control cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase by different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1545777346,"Autophosphorylation of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) under limiting conditions (2 microM ATP) decreased progressively with increasing concentrations of a substrate, Pro-Leu-Ala-Arg-Thr-Leu-Ser-Val-Ala-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gly-Lys-Lys (syntide-2), suggesting a competition between the substrate and the autophosphorylation site(s) of the enzyme. The rate and extent of the generation of Ca2+/CaM-independent activity of the enzyme by autophosphorylation were also decreased by the presence of syntide-2. The syntide-2 phosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+/CaM under the limiting conditions reached a steady state, after a lag, when the Ca2+/CaM-independent activity reached a plateau. A linear relationship was observed between the activities in the presence and absence of Ca2+/CaM of the enzyme which had undergone various degrees of autophosphorylation, and the extrapolation of activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM to zero gave 15-20% of the maximum activity. The steady-state rate of syntide-2 phosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+/CaM by the enzyme that had not undergone prior autophosphorylation was decreased by high concentrations of syntide-2 which suppressed autophosphorylation as well as the generation of Ca2+/CaM-independent activity. These results suggest that although the nonautophosphorylated enzyme possesses a basal low level of Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity, autophosphorylation is required for full activation."
https://openalex.org/W1563167059,"Abstract Rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase that has been activated with lysolecithin catalyzes the hydroxylation of 4-methylphenylalanine in the presence of a pterin cofactor. Two products, 4-hydroxymethylphenylalanine and 3-methyltyrosine, can be detected. The total amount of amino acids hydroxylated is equal to the amount of tetrahydropterin oxidized. Isotopic labeling studies with 18O2 and H2(18)O show that the hydroxyl groups of both products are derived from molecular oxygen and not from water. Results obtained with 2H-labeled substrates support the conclusion that these products are formed via different mechanistic pathways. Our previous investigations on substrate analogs, as well as the present results, indicate that a highly reactive oxygen-containing intermediate, such as an enzyme-bound iron-oxo compound, must be the hydroxylating species. Our present results could stimulate further discussion of the possibility that the reaction mechanism for the NIH-shift of the methyl group may not involve the spontaneous opening of an epoxide intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1673630983,"The serum concentration of rat T1 kininogen increases 20-30-fold in response to acute inflammation, an induced hepatic synthesis regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. To analyze the cis-regulatory elements responsible for the induced transcription, we fused a 1.6-kilobase segment of the rat T1 kininogen promoter to a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The resultant chimeric DNA was transfected into cultured cells. In transient transfection assays, this 5'-flanking sequence was sufficient to confer cell-specific expression: CAT activity was readily detectable when the construct was transfected into liver-derived cells, but it was not detectable in nonliver cells. Furthermore, when liver cells (Hep3B) transfected with this construct were treated with conditioned medium prepared from activated mixed lymphocyte cultures or with recombinant interleukin-6 (IL-6), a 5-fold increase in CAT activity was detected. Addition of dexamethasone to the conditioned medium or to IL-6 showed synergistic effects and resulted in a 10-fold increase in CAT activity. In contrast, when IL-1 was used with IL-6, induction of CAT activity was inhibited. Deletion analyses revealed two regions important for tissue-specific and induced regulation of T1 kininogen: sequences proximal to base pair -73 conferred enhanced expression in liver-derived cells and a distal region that conferred responsiveness to conditioned medium, recombinant IL-6, and dexamethasone. This responsive element had properties of an inducible transcriptional enhancer, and it was functional in both liver and nonliver cells when placed immediately upstream of a thymidine kinase promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1534609312,"The high mobility group (HMG) chromosomal proteins may modulate the structure of distinct regions in chromatin, thereby affecting processes such as development and differentiation. Here we report that the levels of the HMG chromosomal proteins and their mRNAs change significantly during erythropoiesis. Erythroid cells from 5-day chicken embryos contain 2.5-10 times more HMG mRNAs than cells from 14-day embryos, whereas circulating cells from adult animals are devoid of HMG and most other mRNAs. Nuclear run-off experiments and Northern analysis of RNA from various developmental stages and from Percoll-fractionated cells indicate that the genes are transcribed in early cells of either the primitive or definitive erythroid lineage. The rate of synthesis of the various HMGs changes during erythropoiesis; in erythroid cells from 7-day embryos the ratio of HMG-14b or HMG-17 to HMG-14a is, respectively, 8 and 10 times lower than in 9-day erythroids. HMG-14a, the major chicken HMG-14 species, is synthesized mainly in primitive cells, while HMG-14b is preferentially synthesized in definitive cells. Thus, the change from primitive to definitive erythroid lineage during embryogenesis is accompanied by a change in the expression of HMG chromosomal proteins. Conceivably, these changes may affect the structure of certain regions in chromatin; however, it is not presently clear whether the switch in HMG protein gene expression is a consequence or a prerequisite for proper differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2079322033,"During embryonic development of the avian optic tectum, retinal and tectobulbar axons form an orthogonal array of nerve processes. Growing axons of both tracts are transiently very closely apposed to each other. Despite this spatial proximity, axons from the two pathways do not intermix, but instead restrict their growth to defined areas, thus forming two separate plexiform layers, the stratum opticum and the stratum album centrale. In this study we present experimental evidence indicating that the following three mechanisms might play a role in segregating both axonal populations: Retinal and tectobulbar axons differ in their ability to use the extracellular matrix protein laminin as a substrate for axonal elongation; the environment in the optic tectum is generally permissive for retinal axons, but is specifically nonpermissive for tectobulbar axons, resulting in a strong fasciculation of the latter; and growth cones of temporal retinal axons are reversibly inhibited in their motility by direct contact with the tectobulbar axon's membrane."

In contrast, under linear velocity conditions, the C180 peptide possessed less than 1% of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of rS1 using transducin as target. Radiolabeled tryptic peptides of transducin that had been ADP-ribosylated by either rS1 or C180 peptide were identical which suggested that both rS1 and C180 peptide ADP-ribosylated the same amino acid within transducin. To extend the functional primary amino acid map of the S1 subunit, two carboxyl-terminal deletions were constructed. One deletion, C195, removed the 40 carboxyl-terminal amino acids and the other, C219, removed the 16 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the S1 subunit. Both C195 and C219 migrated in reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with apparent molecular masses of 22,000 and 27,500 Da, respectively. Relative to the C180 peptide C195 possessed 10-20-fold increase and C219 possessed 100-150-fold increase in ADP-ribosyltransferase activities. In addition, C219 appeared to have the same ADP-ribosyltransferase activity as rS1. These studies indicate that (i) rS1, purified from Escherichia coli, possesses biochemical properties similar to S1 subunit purified from pertussis toxin, (ii) amino acids 1-180 of the S1 subunit contain residues required for NAD binding, N-glycosidic cleavage, and transfer of ADP-ribose to transducin, and (iii) residues between 181 and 219 of the S1 subunit are required for efficient ADP-ribosyltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2105440030,"The three-dimensional crystal structure of thermitase complexed with eglin-c in the presence of 100 mM calcium has been determined and refined at 2.0-angstrom resolution to a R-factor of 16.8%. This crystal structure is compared with previously determined structures of thermitase at 0 and 5 mM calcium concentration. In the presence of 100 mM calcium all three calcium binding sites in thermitase are fully occupied. At 100 mM CaCl2 the calcium binding is occupied by a calcium ion, which is chelated by three protein ligands and four water molecules in a pentagonal bipyramid geometry. Thermitase has, apparently, a monovalent and divalent cation binding position at 2.5-angstrom distance from each other at this site. At low calcium concentrations the monovalent-ion position is occupied by a sodium or potassium ion. The medium strength binding site shows in the presence of 100 mM CaCl2 a square antiprism arrangement with eight ligands, of which seven are donated by the protein. At low calcium concentrations we observe a distorted pentagonal bipyramid coordination at this site. The largest difference between these two conformations is observed for ligand Asp-60, which has two conformations with 0.8-angstrom difference in C-alpha positions. The strong calcium binding site has a pentagonal bipyramid coordination and is fully occupied in all three structures. Structural changes on binding calcium to the weak and medium strength calcium binding sites of thermitase are limited to the direct surroundings of these sites. Thermitase resembles in this respect subtilisin BPN' and does not exhibit long-range shifts as have been reported for proteinase K."
https://openalex.org/W1605645244,"Specific degenerate codons in the amino-terminal region of a synthetic human parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene exerted dramatic effects on both products and yield of expression of this 84-amino acid polypeptide in Escherichia coli. With adenine-rich degenerate codons constituting the PTH-(1-5) region, intact PTH has been expressed as the only PTH product at 6.5 mg/liter. In contrast, with guanine-rich degenerate codons, the predominent product was analogue PTH-(8-84). Use of cytosine- or thymine-rich degenerate codons generated only a small amount of immunoreactive product (0.2 mg/l). With the amino terminal region reconstituted with adenine-rich degenerate codons, the mid and carboxyl regions of the synthetic gene were also reconstructed to imitate the E. coli-favored codon degeneracy. Expression yielded the intact PTH at 20 mg/liter. Gel electrophoresis and Western blots, with antibodies specific to the amino or carboxyl terminus of PTH, indicated only a single PTH-related polypeptide, with the same mobility as a synthetic intact PTH sample. Amino acid sequencing, composition analysis, mass spectrometry, and the adenylate cyclase bioassays confirmed the purified product as the processed intact PTH."
https://openalex.org/W62860483,"The promoters of Micrococcus luteus, a bacterium whose chromosomal DNA has a high G + C content (74%), diverge from the consensus prokaryotic promoter in having GC-rich DNA sequences at less important positions (Nakayama, M., Fujita, N., Ohama, T., Osawa, S., and Ishihama, A. (1989) Mol. Gen. Genet. 218, 384-389). In order to compare the promoter selectivity of RNA polymerase between M. luteus and Escherichia coli, we purified the enzyme from both organisms. The sets of promoters recognized by the two RNA polymerases were found to overlap partly. Some, but not all, E. coli promoters were found to be correctly transcribed in vitro by M. luteus RNA polymerase as well as the E. coli enzyme. One molecular species of M. luteus sigma factor, with the apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa, was isolated from purified RNA polymerase. By the addition of either M. luteus or E. coli core enzyme it was reconstituted into active holoenzyme. Likewise, M. luteus core enzyme was reconstituted into a hybrid holoenzyme by the addition of E. coli sigma subunit. Both hybrid holoenzymes were, however, able to initiate transcription only from promoters which were recognized by both of the native holoenzymes."
