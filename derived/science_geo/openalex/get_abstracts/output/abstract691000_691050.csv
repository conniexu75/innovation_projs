https://openalex.org/W4221092123,"Genomic surveillance has shaped our understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. We performed a global landscape analysis on SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and genomic data using a collection of country-specific data. Here, we characterize increasing circulation of the Alpha variant in early 2021, subsequently replaced by the Delta variant around May 2021. SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and sequencing availability varied markedly across countries, with 45 countries performing a high level of routine genomic surveillance and 96 countries with a high availability of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. We also observed a marked heterogeneity of sequencing percentage, sequencing technologies, turnaround time and completeness of released metadata across regions and income groups. A total of 37% of countries with explicit reporting on variants shared less than half of their sequences of variants of concern (VOCs) in public repositories. Our findings indicate an urgent need to increase timely and full sharing of sequences, the standardization of metadata files and support for countries with limited sequencing and bioinformatics capacity."
https://openalex.org/W4220939921,"Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a lifelong genodermatosis associated with blistering, wounding, and scarring caused by mutations in COL7A1, the gene encoding the anchoring fibril component, collagen VII (C7). Here, we evaluated beremagene geperpavec (B-VEC), an engineered, non-replicating COL7A1 containing herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) vector, to treat RDEB skin. B-VEC restored C7 expression in RDEB keratinocytes, fibroblasts, RDEB mice and human RDEB xenografts. Subsequently, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 and 2 clinical trial (NCT03536143) evaluated matched wounds from nine RDEB patients receiving topical B-VEC or placebo repeatedly over 12 weeks. No grade 2 or above B-VEC-related adverse events or vector shedding or tissue-bound skin immunoreactants were noted. HSV-1 and C7 antibodies sometimes presented at baseline or increased after B-VEC treatment without an apparent impact on safety or efficacy. Primary and secondary objectives of C7 expression, anchoring fibril assembly, wound surface area reduction, duration of wound closure, and time to wound closure following B-VEC treatment were met. A patient-reported pain-severity secondary outcome was not assessed given the small proportion of wounds treated. A global assessment secondary endpoint was not pursued due to redundancy with regard to other endpoints. These studies show that B-VEC is an easily administered, safely tolerated, topical molecular corrective therapy promoting wound healing in patients with RDEB."

We thus developed a cell atlas in which human and mouse trigeminal ganglia are transcriptionally and epigenomically profiled at single-cell resolution. These data describe evolutionarily conserved and human-specific gene expression patterns within each trigeminal ganglion cell type, as well as the transcription factors and gene regulatory elements that contribute to cell-type-specific gene expression. We then leveraged these data to identify trigeminal ganglion cell types that are implicated both by human genetic variation associated with migraine and two mouse models of headache. This trigeminal ganglion cell atlas improves our understanding of the cell types, genes, and epigenomic features involved in headache pathophysiology and establishes a rich resource of cell-type-specific molecular features to guide the development of more selective treatments for headache and facial pain."
https://openalex.org/W4220927627,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can identify variants that cause genetic disease, but the time required for sequencing and analysis has been a barrier to its use in acutely ill patients. In the present study, we develop an approach for ultra-rapid nanopore WGS that combines an optimized sample preparation protocol, distributing sequencing over 48 flow cells, near real-time base calling and alignment, accelerated variant calling and fast variant filtration for efficient manual review. Application to two example clinical cases identified a candidate variant in <8 h from sample preparation to variant identification. We show that this framework provides accurate variant calls and efficient prioritization, and accelerates diagnostic clinical genome sequencing twofold compared with previous approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4225300092,"Much concern about tropical deforestation focuses on oil palm plantations, but their impacts remain poorly quantified. Using nation-wide interpretation of satellite imagery, and sample-based error calibration, we estimated the impact of large-scale (industrial) and smallholder oil palm plantations on natural old-growth (“primary”) forests from 2001 to 2019 in Indonesia, the world’s largest palm oil producer. Over nineteen years, the area mapped under oil palm doubled, reaching 16.24 Mha in 2019 (64% industrial; 36% smallholder), more than the official estimates of 14.72 Mha. The forest area declined by 11% (9.79 Mha), including 32% (3.09 Mha) ultimately converted into oil palm, and 29% (2.85 Mha) cleared and converted in the same year. Industrial plantations replaced more forest than detected smallholder plantings (2.13 Mha vs 0.72 Mha). New plantations peaked in 2009 and 2012 and declined thereafter. Expansion of industrial plantations and forest loss were correlated with palm oil prices. A price decline of 1% was associated with a 1.08% decrease in new industrial plantations and with a 0.68% decrease of forest loss. Deforestation fell below pre-2004 levels in 2017–2019 providing an opportunity to focus on sustainable management. As the price of palm oil has doubled since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, effective regulation is key to minimising future forest conversion."
https://openalex.org/W4220675433,"Spatial transcriptomics enables the simultaneous measurement of morphological features and transcriptional profiles of the same cells or regions in tissues. Here we present multi-modal structured embedding (MUSE), an approach to characterize cells and tissue regions by integrating morphological and spatially resolved transcriptional data. We demonstrate that MUSE can discover tissue subpopulations missed by either modality as well as compensate for modality-specific noise. We apply MUSE to diverse datasets containing spatial transcriptomics (seqFISH+, STARmap or Visium) and imaging (hematoxylin and eosin or fluorescence microscopy) modalities. MUSE identified biologically meaningful tissue subpopulations and stereotyped spatial patterning in healthy brain cortex and intestinal tissues. In diseased tissues, MUSE revealed gene biomarkers for proximity to tumor region and heterogeneity of amyloid precursor protein processing across Alzheimer brain regions. MUSE enables the integration of multi-modal data to provide insights into the states, functions and organization of cells in complex biological tissues. Deep learning analysis of microscopy and spatial transcriptomics data characterizes cell types and states."
https://openalex.org/W4225488461,"Information on U.S. COVID-19 mortality rates by occupation is limited. We aimed to characterize 2020 COVID-19 fatalities among working Californians to inform preventive strategies.We identified laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 fatalities with dates of death in 2020 by matching death certificates to the state's COVID-19 case registry. Working status for decedents aged 18-64 years was determined from state employment records, death certificates, and case registry data and classified as ""confirmed working,"" ""likely working,"" or ""not working."" We calculated age-adjusted overall and occupation-specific COVID-19 mortality rates using 2019 American Community Survey denominators.COVID-19 accounted for 8,050 (9.9%) of 81,468 fatalities among Californians 18-64 years old. Of these decedents, 2,486 (30.9%) were matched to state employment records and classified as ""confirmed working."" The remainder were classified as ""likely working"" (n = 4,121 [51.2%]) or ""not working"" (n = 1,443 [17.9%]) using death certificate and case registry data. Confirmed and likely working COVID-19 decedents were predominantly male (76.3%), Latino (68.7%), and foreign-born (59.6%), with high school or less education (67.9%); 7.8% were Black. The overall age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate was 30.0 per 100,000 workers (95% confidence interval [CI], 29.3-30.8). Workers in nine occupational groups had age-adjusted mortality rates higher than this overall rate, including those in farming (78.0; 95% CI, 68.7-88.2); material moving (77.8; 95% CI, 70.2-85.9); construction (62.4; 95% CI, 57.7-67.4); production (60.2; 95% CI, 55.7-65.0); and transportation (57.2; 95% CI, 52.2-62.5) occupations. While occupational differences in mortality were evident across demographic groups, mortality rates were three-fold higher for male compared with female workers and three- to seven-fold higher for Latino and Black workers compared with Asian and White workers.Californians in manual labor and in-person service occupations experienced disproportionate COVID-19 mortality, with the highest rates observed among male, Latino, and Black workers; these occupational group should be prioritized for prevention."
https://openalex.org/W4221093065,"Cancer is a life-altering event causing considerable psychological distress. However, information on the total burden of psychiatric disorders across all common adult cancers and therapy exposures has remained scarce. Here, we estimated the risk of self-harm after incident psychiatric disorder diagnosis in patients with cancer and the risk of unnatural deaths after self-harm in 459,542 individuals. Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder in patients with cancer. Patients who received chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery had the highest cumulative burden of psychiatric disorders. Patients treated with alkylating agent chemotherapeutics had the highest burden of psychiatric disorders, whereas those treated with kinase inhibitors had the lowest burden. All mental illnesses were associated with an increased risk of subsequent self-harm, where the highest risk was observed within 12 months of the mental illness diagnosis. Patients who harmed themselves were 6.8 times more likely to die of unnatural causes of death compared with controls within 12 months of self-harm (hazard ratio (HR), 6.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.3-10.7). The risk of unnatural death after 12 months was markedly lower (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.7). We provide an extensive knowledge base to help inform collaborative cancer-psychiatric care initiatives by prioritizing patients who are most at risk."
https://openalex.org/W4220809677,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an active inflammatory response induced by the brain's deposition and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ). Cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) is expressed in specific brain areas, modulating functions, and pathophysiologies in CNS. Herein, we aimed to evaluate whether activation of CB2R can improve the cognitive impairment in the experimental AD-like model and determine the involved intracellular signaling pathway. Injection of D-galactose (150 mg/kg, i.p.) was performed to urge AD-like features in bilaterally ovariectomized female rats (OVC/D-gal rats) for 8-weeks. Then, AM1241, a CB2R-agonist (3 and 6 mg/kg), was injected intraperitoneally starting from the 6th week. Treatment with AM1241, significantly down-regulated; Toll-like receptor4 (TLR4), Myd88 (TLR4-adaptor protein) genes expression, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines (NFκB p65, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12). In contrast, it enhanced BDNF (the brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and CREB (the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein) as well as the immune-modulatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) levels. Moreover, AM1241 lessened the immune-expression of GFAP, CD68, caspase-3, and NFκB p65 markers and mended the histopathological damage observed in OVC/D-gal rats by decreasing the deposition of amyloid plaques and degenerative neuronal lesions, as well as improving their recognition and learning memory in both novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. In conclusion, activating CB2R by the selective agonist AM1241 can overrun cognitive deficits in OVC/D-gal rats through modulation of TLR4/ NFκB p65 signaling, mediated by modulating CREB/BDNF pathway, thereby can be applied as a potential therapeutic strategy in AD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4220654325,"Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) causes significant mortality and morbidity, with advanced metastasis. WNT signaling is a promising therapeutic target for metastatic PCa. GIPC2 is a GIPC1 paralog involved in WNT signaling pathways associated with tumor progression, but its role in PCa metastasis remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that high GIPC2 expression in PCa tissues was significantly associated with distant metastasis and poor prognosis. Functional studies demonstrated that high GIPC2 expression due to CpG-island demethylation promoted increased metastatic capabilities of PCa cells. Conversely, silencing GIPC2 expression significantly inhibited PCa metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, GIPC2 directly bound the WNT co-receptor Fzd7 through its PDZ domain, which enabled activation of WNT-β-catenin cascades, thereby stimulating PCa metastasis. Interestingly, GIPC2 protein was also identified as a component of exosomes and that it robustly stimulated PCa adhesion, invasion, and migration. The presence of GIPC2 in tumor-derived exosomes and ability to impact the behavior of tumor cells suggest that GIPC2 is a novel epigenetic oncogene involved in PCa metastasis. Our findings identified GIPC2 as a novel exosomal molecule associated with WNT signaling and may represent a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for metastatic PCa."

https://openalex.org/W4221032046,"Senescent cells accumulate with aging and have been shown to contribute to age-associated diseases and organ dysfunction. Eliminating senescent cells with senolytic drugs has been shown to improve age phenotypes in mouse models and there is some initial evidence that it may improve the health of persons with chronic diseases. In this study, we employed WI-38 human fibroblasts rendered senescent by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) to screen several plant extracts for their potential senolytic and/or senomorphic activity. Of these, ginger extract ( Zingiber officinale Rosc .) selectively caused the death of senescent cells without affecting proliferating cells. Among the major individual components of ginger extract, gingerenone A and 6-shogaol showed promising senolytic properties, with gingerenone A selectively eliminating senescent cells. Similar to the senolytic cocktail dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q), gingerenone A and 6-shogaol elicited an apoptotic program. Additionally, both D+Q and gingerenone A had a pronounced effect on suppressing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Gingerenone A selectively promotes the death of senescent cells with no effect on non-senescent cells and these characteristics strongly support the idea that this natural compound may have therapeutic benefit in diseases characterized by senescent cell accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W4225746567,"When used in closed-type plant factories, light-emitting diode (LED) illumination systems have the particular advantages of low heat emission and high luminous efficiency. The effects of illumination quality and intensity on the growth and morphogenesis of many plant species have been examined, but improvements are needed to optimize the illumination systems for better plant products with lower resource investments. In particular, new strategies are needed to reduce the wastage of plant products related to leaf senescence, and to better control the ingredients and appearance of leafy vegetables. Although the quality of light is often altered to change the characteristics of plant products, the transcriptional status underlying the physiological responses of plants to light has not been established. Herein, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis using RNA-sequencing to determine how red, blue, and red/blue LEDs and fluorescent light sources affect transcriptome involved in the leaf aging of leaf lettuce. The RNA-sequencing profiling revealed clear differences in the transcriptome between young and old leaves. Red LED light caused large variation between the two age classes, while a pure or mixed blue LED light spectrum induced fewer transcriptome differences between young and old leaves. Collectively, the expression levels of genes that showed homology with those of other model organisms provide a detailed physiological overview, incorporating such characteristics as the senescence, nutrient deficiency, and anthocyanin synthesis of the leaf lettuce plants. Our findings suggest that transcriptome profiles of leaf lettuce grown under different light sources provide helpful information to achieve better growth conditions for marketable and efficient green-vegetable production, with improved wastage control and efficient nutrient inputs."

https://openalex.org/W4220809611,"Globally, the population in rural communities are disproportionately cared for by only 25% and 38% of the total physicians and nursing staff, respectively; hence, the poor health outcomes in these communities. This condition is worse in Nigeria by the critical shortage of skilled healthcare workforce. This study aimed to explore factors responsible for the uneven distribution of healthcare workers (physicians and nurses) to rural areas of Ebonyi State, Nigeria.Qualitative data were obtained using semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus group discussions from purposively selected physicians, nurses, and policymakers in the state. Data was analysed for themes related to factors influencing the mal-distribution of healthcare workers (physicians and nurses) to rural areas. The qualitative analysis involved the use of both inductive and deductive reasoning in an iterative manner.This study showed that there were diverse reasons for the uneven distribution of skilled healthcare workers in Ebonyi State. This was broadly classified into three themes; socio-cultural, healthcare system, and personal healthcare workers' intrinsic factors. The socio-cultural factors include symbolic capital and stigma while healthcare system and governance issues include poor human resources for health policy and planning, work resources and environment, decentralization, salary differences, skewed distribution of tertiary health facilities to urban area and political interference. The intrinsic healthcare workers' factors include career progression and prospect, negative effect on family life, personal characteristics and background, isolation, personal perceptions and beliefs.There may be a need to implement both non-financial and financial actions to encourage more urban to rural migration of healthcare workers (physicians and nurses) and to provide incentives for the retention of rural-based health workers."
https://openalex.org/W4220965143,"Physician-scientists comprise a unique and valuable part of the biomedical workforce, but for decades there has been concern about the number of physicians actively engaged in research. Reports have outlined the challenges facing physician-scientists, and programs have been initiated to encourage and facilitate research careers for medically trained scientists. Many of these initiatives have demonstrated successful outcomes, but there has not been a recent summary of the impact of the past decade of effort. This report compiles available data from surveys of medical education and physician research participation to assess changes in the physician-scientist workforce from 2011-2020. Several trends are positive: rising enrollments in MD-PhD programs, greater levels of interest in research careers among matriculating medical students, more research experience during medical school and rising numbers of physicians in academic medicine, and an increase in first R01 grants to physician-scientists. However, there are now decreased levels of interest in research careers among graduating medical students, a steady decline in MDs applying for NIH loan repayment program support, an increased age at first R01 grant success for physicians, and fewer physicians reporting research as their primary work activity: all of these indicators create concern for the stability of the career path. Despite a recommendation by the Physician-Scientist Workforce in 2014 to create ""real-time"" reporting on NIH grants and grantees to help the public assess trends, this initiative has not been completed. Better information is still needed to fully understand the status of the physician-scientist workforce, and to assess efforts to stabilize this vulnerable career path."
https://openalex.org/W4226050222,"In this study, we quantitatively assessed the effectiveness of systems for COVID-19 testing in small groups of sport teams that are semi-isolated from the general population by countermeasures against infection. Two types of group were assumed, and the dynamics of infection within each group was modeled by using a compartment model of infectious disease. One group (Group A) comprised domestic professional sports teams that play many games over a season while remaining within a relatively small region. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were routinely conducted once every 2 weeks, and the number of infected individuals that could not be quarantined after identification by testing or checking for symptoms was defined as the risk. The other group (Group B) comprised teams that travel across borders for mass-gathering events like the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The teams were isolated for 2 weeks at their destination; frequent testing and checking for symptoms was conducted, and any infected individuals were quarantined. The number of infected individuals participating in games after the isolation period was defined as the risk. In Group A, the number of infected individuals detected by routinely conducted PCR testing was lower than the number of infected individuals detected by checking for symptoms, indicating that routine testing every 2 weeks was not very effective. In Group B, daily PCR testing was the most effective, followed by daily antigen testing. Dual testing, in which individuals with a positive antigen test were given an additional PCR test, was the least effective with an effect equal to PCR testing every other day. These results indicate that repeated testing does not necessarily increase the detection of infected individuals."

https://openalex.org/W4221096224,"Purpose There is limited knowledge on how to tackle mental health problems among youth in Africa. Literature describing community engagement (CE) approaches in low/middle-income countries (LMICs) health research is sparse. CE with youth from LMICS can help steer and shape culturally relevant interventions for stigmatised topics like mental health, resulting in better healthcare experiences. We share our experience of engaging youth in Malawi through advocacy organisations to inform cultural adaptation of a mental health literacy intervention. Methods Young people were recruited using social media from universities and community youth organisations in Malawi to participate in focus group discussions to help culturally adapt content of an existing mental health literacy intervention. Nine online focus groups with 44 individuals were conducted. Discussions involved views and experiences of mental health, including impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis. Results Transcript analyses revealed a vicious cycle of poverty and mental health problems for youth in Malawi. Four key themes were identified, 1) poverty-related socioeconomic and health challenges, 2) no one talks about mental health, 3) lacking mental health support and 4) relationship issues. These themes fed into one another within this vicious cycle which perpetually and negatively impacted their lives. The coronavirus pandemic worsened socioeconomic issues, health challenges, mental health and substance use issues, and burden on Malawi’s already weak mental health system. Conclusion Findings suggest increasing untreated mental health burden among Malawi’s youth. It highlights great need to address mental health literacy using existing community structures like educational settings to minimise burden on a weak health system. Online focus groups are an effective way of acquiring views from various young people in Malawi on mental health. This CE approach has grown our stakeholder network, strengthening potential for future CE activities and broader research dissemination."

Five of the jars bear rosette stamp impressions on their handles, indicating that their content was related to the kingdom of Judah's royal economy. The identification of the original contents remains is significant for the understanding of many aspects related to the nutrition, economy and international trade in the ancient Levant. The study shed light on the contents of the jars and the destruction process of the buildings in which they were found. The jars were used alternatively for storing wine and olive oil. The wine was flavored with vanilla. These results attest to the wine consumption habits of the Judahite elite and echo Jerusalem's involvement in the trans-regional South Arabian trade of spices and other lucrative commodities on the eve of its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar."
https://openalex.org/W4221103855,"Mast cells (MCs) develop from hematopoietic progenitors and differentiate into mature MCs that reside within connective or mucosal tissues. Though the number of MCs in tissues usually remains constant, inflammation and asthma disturb this homeostasis, leading to proliferation of MCs. Understanding the signaling events behind this proliferative response could lead to the development of novel strategies for better management of allergic diseases. MC survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration are all maintained by a MC growth factor, stem cell factor (SCF) via its receptor, KIT. Here, we explored how protein kinase C (PKC) redundancy influences MC proliferation in bone marrow-derived MC (BMMC). We found that SCF activates PKCα and PKCβ isoforms, which in turn modulates KIT phosphorylation and internalization. Further, PKCα and PKCβ activate p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and this axis subsequently regulates SCF-induced MC cell proliferation. To ascertain the individual roles of PKCα and PKCβ, we knocked down either PKCα or PKCβ or both via short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and analyzed KIT phosphorylation, p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and MC viability and proliferation. To our surprise, downregulation of neither PKCα nor PKCβ affected MC viability and proliferation. In contrast, blocking both PKCα and PKCβ significantly attenuated SCF-induced cell viability and proliferation, suggesting that PKCα and PKCβ compensate for each other downstream of SCF signaling to enhance MC viability and proliferation. Our results not only suggest that PKC classical isoforms are novel therapeutic targets for SCF/MC-mediated inflammatory and allergic diseases, but they also emphasize the importance of inhibiting both PKCα and β isoforms simultaneously to prevent MC proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W4226150545,"Understanding the main factors contributing to individual differences in fluid intelligence is one of the main challenges of psychology. A vast body of research has evolved from the theoretical framework put forward by Cattell, who developed the Culture-Fair IQ Test (CFT 20-R) to assess fluid intelligence. In this work, we extend and complement the current state of research by analysing the differential and combined relationship between eye-movement patterns and socio-demographic information and the ability of a participant to correctly solve a CFT item. Our work shows that a participant's eye movements while solving a CFT item contain discriminative information and can be used to predict whether the participant will succeed in solving the test item. Moreover, the information related to eye movements complements the information provided by socio-demographic data when it comes to success prediction. In combination, both types of information yield a significantly higher predictive performance than each information type individually. To better understand the contributions of features related to eye movements and socio-demographic information to predict a participant's success in solving a CFT item, we employ state-of-the-art explainability techniques and show that, along with socio-demographic variables, eye-movement data. Especially the number of saccades and the mean pupil diameter, significantly increase the discriminating power. The eye-movement features are likely indicative of processing efficiency and invested mental effort. Beyond the specific contribution to research on how eye movements can serve as a means to uncover mechanisms underlying cognitive processes, the findings presented in this work pave the way for further in-depth investigations of factors predicting individual differences in fluid intelligence."
https://openalex.org/W4220762833,"Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with an increased risk of post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs) following lung cancer resection. It remains unclear whether smoking cessation reduces this risk.Retrospective review of a large, prospectively collected database of over 1000 consecutive resections for lung cancer in a quaternary lung cancer centre over a 23-year period.One thousand and thirteen patients underwent curative-intent lobectomy or pneumonectomy between 1995 and 2018. Three hundred and sixty-two patients (36%) were ex-smokers, 314 (31%) were current smokers and 111 (11%) were never smokers. A pre-operative diagnosis of COPD was present in 57% of current smokers, 57% of ex-smokers and 20% of never smokers. Just over 25% of patients experienced a PPC. PPCs were more frequent in current smokers compared to never smokers (27% vs 17%, p = 0.036), however, no difference was seen between current and ex-smokers (p = 0.412) or between never and ex-smokers (p = 0.113). Those with a diagnosis of COPD, independent of smoking status, had a higher frequency of both PPCs (65% vs 35%, p<0.01) and overall complications (60% vs 40%, p<0.01) as well as a longer length of hospital stay (10 vs 9 days, p<0.01).Smoking and COPD are both associated with a higher rate of PPCs post lung cancer resection. COPD, independent of smoking status, is also associated with an increased overall post-operative complication rate and length of hospital stay. An emphasis on COPD treatment optimisation, rather than smoking cessation in isolation, may help improve post-operative outcomes."

Malnutrition caused by insufficient complementary feeding accounts for more than one-third of all under-five mortality whereas appropriate feeding practices are critical for improving nutritional status and ensuring child survival. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of appropriate complementary feeding practices among mothers having 6-23 months children, from Feb.-march 2020 and associated factors in Shashemene Town, Oromia, Ethiopia.From February to March of 2020, a community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted. 536 mothers with children aged 6 to 23 months were chosen for the study using a two-stage sampling procedure. Data was collected by Face-to-face interviews during home-to-home visits with mothers who had children aged 6-23 months, using a structured questionnaire on the main complementary feeding indicators. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used to analyze the data. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with appropriate complementary feeding practice, with statistical significance set at probability value < 0.05.The proportion of children aged 6-23 months who met the criteria for complementary food introduction, minimum meal frequency, minimum dietary diversity, minimum acceptable diet, and appropriate complementary feeding practices was 67.9 percent, 61.7 percent, 42.5 percent, 41.7 percent, and 30 percent, respectively.

The intervention group received PharmQuit as an additional service. Both groups were scheduled for follow-up visits on days 7, 14, 30, 60, 120, and 180. The primary outcome was continuous abstinence rate on day 180. The secondary outcomes included 7-day point abstinence rate, number of cigarettes smoked per day, exhaled carbon monoxide levels, adherence rate to the program, and satisfaction with PharmQuit. An analysis using the intent-to-treat principle was performed. Smoking cessation rates and the number of cigarettes smoked per day were significantly higher during the follow-up visits in both groups (p < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The adherence rate to the smoking cessation program was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (74 days vs. 60 days, p > 0.05). The results showed the benefits of the contribution of community pharmacists. Although the inclusion of PharmQuit did not yield better results than pharmacists' counselling alone, it may help obtain better adherence to smoking cessation programs.

https://openalex.org/W4220757792,"A combined forecast from multiple models is typically more accurate than an individual forecast, but there are few examples of studies of combining in infectious disease forecasting. We investigated the accuracy of different ways of combining interval forecasts of weekly incident and cumulative coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) mortality.We considered weekly interval forecasts, for 1- to 4-week prediction horizons, with out-of-sample periods of approximately 18 months ending on 8 January 2022, for multiple locations in the United States, using data from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Our comparison involved simple and more complex combining methods, including methods that involve trimming outliers or performance-based weights. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using interval scores, weighted interval scores, skill scores, ranks, and reliability diagrams.The weighted inverse score and median combining methods performed best for forecasts of incident deaths. Overall, the leading inverse score method was 12% better than the mean benchmark method in forecasting the 95% interval and, considering all interval forecasts, the median was 7% better than the mean. Overall, the median was the most accurate method for forecasts of cumulative deaths. Compared to the mean, the median's accuracy was 65% better in forecasting the 95% interval, and 43% better considering all interval forecasts. For all combining methods except the median, combining forecasts from only compartmental models produced better forecasts than combining forecasts from all models.Combining forecasts can improve the contribution of probabilistic forecasting to health policy decision making during epidemics. The relative performance of combining methods depends on the extent of outliers and the type of models in the combination. The median combination has the advantage of being robust to outlying forecasts. Our results support the Hub's use of the median and we recommend further investigation into the use of weighted methods."

North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (NDDOCR) data from 2009 to 2018 was used and period prevalence was calculated for this 10-year time period. The period prevalence of HCV infection was (15.13% (95% CI 14.39–15.90) with a marginally significant (p-value: 0.0542) increasing linear trend in annual prevalence over this period. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with HCV infection. The main significant independent risk factors for HCV infection in this incarcerated population were age &gt;40 years [OR: 1.78 (1.37–2.32)]; sex [OR: 1.21 (1.03–1.43)]; race/ethnicity [OR: 1.97 (1.69–2.29)]; history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) [OR: 7.36 (6.41–8.44)]; history of needle or syringe sharing [OR: 7.57 (6.62–8.67)]; and alcohol use [OR: 0.87 (0.77–0.99)]. Study limitations include uncollected information on sexual history, frequency or duration of injection drug use and blood transfusion history of the incarcerated population. Considering the high prevalence of HCV infection and its associated risk factors, it is important to implement prevention programs such as syringe/needle exchanges and counsel with imprisoned IVD users."
https://openalex.org/W4220870552,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that is able to survive abnormally high levels of ionizing radiation (IR). The radiolysis of water by IR generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 and OH-. C. neoformans withstands the damage caused by IR and ROS through antioxidant production and enzyme-catalyzed breakdown of ROS. Given these particular cellular protein needs, questions arise whether transfer ribonucleic acids molecules (tRNAs) undergo unique chemical modifications to maintain their structure, stability, and/or function under such environmental conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of IR and H2O2 exposure on tRNAs in C. neoformans. We experimentally identified the modified nucleosides present in C. neoformans tRNAs and quantified changes in those modifications upon exposure to oxidative conditions. To better understand these modified nucleoside results, we also evaluated tRNA pool composition in response to the oxidative conditions. We found that regardless of environmental conditions, tRNA modifications and transcripts were minimally affected. A rationale for the stability of the tRNA pool and its concomitant profile of modified nucleosides is proposed based on the lack of codon bias throughout the C. neoformans genome and in particular for oxidative response transcripts. Our findings suggest that C. neoformans can rapidly adapt to oxidative environments as mRNA translation/protein synthesis are minimally impacted by codon bias."

While acupuncture therapy has been reported to effectively reduce such pain and autonomic distress in children, its effect in preventing emergence agitation remains unclear. Therefore, we will conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis to evaluate the effect of acupuncture therapy in preventing emergence agitation in children undergoing general anesthesia. Methods and analysis This protocol was prepared according to the 2015 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for Protocols guidelines. We will conduct a search for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of acupuncture therapy in preventing emergence agitation. The following databases will be searched for relevant articles: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, and Web of Science; four pre-registration sites will be accessed from inception to April 1, 2021. No language restrictions will be applied. Two authors will independently scan and select eligible studies, extract the data, and assess the risk of bias. The incidence of emergence agitation will be combined as a risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval using a random-effect model. The I 2 statistics will be used to assess heterogeneity. We will evaluate the quality of the clinical trials using the Cochrane methodology and assess the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. If appropriate, a trial sequential analysis will be performed. Expected outcomes This meta-analysis will be the first to evaluate the effect of acupuncture therapy in preventing emergence agitation in children. The findings from this meta-analysis have the potential to reveal pivotal factors that affect the clinical effect of acupuncture therapy, thereby supporting the optimization of acupuncture therapy for emergence agitation.

https://openalex.org/W4220975758,"The risk-based active surveillance for Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was carried out in China from 2011 to 2020. A total of 110,018 swabs were collected from 28 provinces. 2,389 class I NDVs were isolated and identified by RT-PCR and sequencing. The average annual positivity rate of class I NDVs from 2011 to 2020 was 2.17%. In the last 10 years, the positivity rate was highest in 2011 (4.76%), and has since decreased. Most viruses were isolated from chickens, while others were collected from ducks, geese and pigeons, as well as from the environment. The positivity rates for class I NDVs in poultry ranged from 0.55% to 2.40%. The viruses were isolated from 373 sampling sites in 24 provinces, mainly in East, Central, South and Southwest China. The positivity rates of NDVs in wholesale markets (51.58%) and retail markets (42.83%) were much higher than those in poultry farms (7.14%) and slaughterhouses (3.85%). Phylogenetic analyses showed that most isolates belonged to sub-genotype 1.1.2, while only 22 viruses belonged to sub-genotype 1.2, indicating the viruses in sub-genotype 1.1.2 were the predominant strains in China. The F and HN genes of six strains in the two sub-genotypes were sequenced and analyzed. The cleavage sites of F protein in the six viruses were 112ERQER/L117, 112ERQGR/L117 or 112GRQERL117, which were typical of low virulence NDV. Several mutations were identified in the functional domains of F and HN proteins, including fusion peptide, heptad repeat region, transmembrane domains and neutralizing epitopes. This study revealed the distribution, genetic and phylogenetic characteristics of class I NDVs in China, and could help us to better understand the epidemiological context of class I NDVs in China."
https://openalex.org/W4221013819,"Uncertainty has been shown to reduce the willingness to cooperate in various social dilemmas and negatively affect prosocial behavior. However, some studies showed that uncertainty does not always decrease prosocial behavior, depending on the type of uncertainty. More specifically, recent research has shown that prosocial behavior tends to increase under impact uncertainty—uncertainty about the consequences for others if they become infected. In addition, researchers have argued that intuition favors prosocial behavior while deliberation leads to selfish behavior. Our study explored how intuitive (time pressure) or deliberate mental processing, under outcome, or impact uncertainty affect prosocial behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our sample consists of 496 participants, and we used a 4 (COVID-19 scenario: Control vs. Impact Uncertainty vs. Worst-Case vs. Indirect Transmission) by 2 (decision time: time delay vs. time pressure) between-subjects design. Results suggest that participants are more inclined to stay at home (prosocial intention) when forced to make their decisions intuitively rather than deliberately. Additionally, we found that uncertainty does not always decrease prosocial behavior. It seems that uncertainty does not affect the prosocial intention in a scenario with a real infectious disease. These findings suggest that the distinction between outcome and impact uncertainty may be due to the realism of experimental stimuli interventions."

The species can only be found on the north-west slopes of the highest volcano on Isabela Island and was first described to science in 2009. As part of a population telemetry study, a health assessment was authorized by the Galápagos National Park. Wild adult iguanas were captured on Wolf Volcano in September 2019 and April 2021 to record morphological and physiological parameters including body temperature, heart rate, intraocular pressures, tear formation, and infrared iris images. Blood samples were also collected and analyzed. An i-STAT portable blood analyzer was used to obtain values for base excess in the extracellular fluid compartment (BEecf), glucose (Glu), hematocrit (HctPCV), hemoglobin (Hb), ionized calcium (iCa), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), percent oxygen saturation (sO2%), pH, potassium (K), and sodium (Na). When possible, data were compared to previously published and available data for the other Galápagos iguanas. The results reported here provide baseline values that will be useful in detecting changes in health status among pink land iguanas affected by climate change, invasive species, anthropogenic threats, or natural disturbances. The collected data also provide an invaluable resource for conservation scientists planning to implement conservation strategies, like translocations, that may temporarily alter these baseline values."

In this study, we designed and synthesized a combinatorial peptide library allowing us to profile class IIa HDACs sequence specificity at positions +3 through -3 from the central lysine modified by the well-accepted trifluoroacetyl function. Our data revealed a strong preference for bulky aromatic acids directly flanking the central trifluoroacetyllysine, while all class IIa HDACs disfavor positively charged residues and proline at the +1/-1 positions. The chemical nature of amino acid residues N-terminally to the central trifluoroacetyllysine has a more profound effect on substrate recognition as compared to residues located C-terminally. These findings were validated by designing selected favored and disfavored peptide sequences, with the favored ones are accepted with catalytic efficacy of 75 000 and 525 000 M-1 s-1 for HDAC7 and HDAC5, respectively. Results reported here could help in developing class IIa HDACs inhibitors and also in the search for new natural class IIa HDACs substrates."
https://openalex.org/W4229371279,"The collecting duct is a highly adaptive terminal part of the nephron, which is essential for maintaining systemic homeostasis. Principal and intercalated cells perform different physiological tasks and exhibit distinctive morphology. However, acid-secreting A- and base secreting B-type of intercalated cells cannot be easily separated in functional studies. We used BCECF-sensitive intracellular pH (pHi ) measurements in split-opened collecting ducts followed by immunofluorescent microscopy in WT and intercalated cell-specific ClC-K2-/- mice to demonstrate that ClC-K2 inhibition enables to distinguish signals from A- and B-intercalated cells. We show that ClC-K2 Cl- channel is expressed on the basolateral side of intercalated cells, where it governs Cl- -dependent H+ /HCO3- transport. ClC-K2 blocker, NPPB, caused acidification or alkalization in different subpopulations of intercalated cells in WT but not ClC-K2-/- mice. Immunofluorescent assessment of the same collecting ducts revealed that NPPB increased pHi in AE1-positive A-type and decreased pHi in pendrin-positive B-type of intercalated cells. Induction of metabolic acidosis led to a significantly augmented abundance and H+ secretion in A-type and decreased proton transport in B-type of intercalated cells, whereas metabolic alkalosis caused the opposite changes in intercalated cell function, but did not substantially change their relative abundance. Overall, we show that inhibition of ClC-K2 can be employed to discriminate between A- and B-type of intercalated cells in split-opened collecting duct preparations. We further demonstrate that this method can be used to independently monitor changes in the functional status and abundance of A- and B-type in response to systemic acid/base stimuli."

Biophilia is an innate, biological tendency to be close to natural and cultural elements, which may be a critical motivation for achieving sustainable heritage management. Past studies used qualitative and quantitative methods to extract participants' pull and push motivations toward heritage tourism and captured the six motivations of the biophilia framework that should be confirmed: heritage architecture; art activity; wide nature; regional attraction; recreational benefits; and long-term values. The purpose of this study was to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to test the biophilia framework for understanding biophilic heritage tourism. A questionnaire with 18 items of heritage tourism motivation was used to explore the purpose of this study. A total of 193 valid questionnaires were obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the six motivations of the biophilia framework. The results indicated that heritage tourism motivation consisted of a second-order six-factor structure with high validity and reliability. These six dimensions reflected the biophilic requirements and provided a biophilic planning principle to achieve sustainable heritage management to satisfy the needs of the participants."
https://openalex.org/W4225795371,"The F prostanoid receptor (FP), which accounts for the therapeutic effect of PGF2α in uterine atony that leads to postpartum hemorrhage and maternal morbidity, could possibly mediate vasoconstrictor effect in small or resistance arteries to elevate blood pressure that limits the clinical use of the agent in patients with cardiovascular disorders. This study aimed to test the above hypothesis with genetically altered mice. Ex vivo and in vivo experiments were performed on control wild-type (WT) mice and mice with deficiencies in FP (FP−/−) or thromboxane (Tx)-prostanoid receptor (the original receptor of TxA2; TP−/−), and/or those with an additional deficiency in E prostanoid receptor-3 (one of the vasoconstrictor receptors of PGE2; EP3−/−). Here, we show that PGF2α indeed evoked vasoconstrictor responses in the above-mentioned tissues of WT mice, which were however unaltered by FP−/−. Interestingly, such contractile responses were reversed into dilations by TP−/−/EP3−/−. A similar pattern of results was observed with the pressor effect of PGF2α under in vivo conditions. However, TP−/− alone (which could largely remove the contractile responses) did not result in relaxation to PGF2α. Also, either the ex vivo vasodilator effect or the in vivo depressor response of PGF2α obtained after the removal of TP and EP3-mediated actions was unaltered by FP−/−. Therefore, both the ex vivo vasoconstrictor action in small or resistance arteries and the systemic pressor effect of PGF2α can reflect vasoconstrictor activities derived from the non-FP receptors TP and EP3 outweighing a concurrently activated dilator effect, which is again independent of FP."

This research is the first to systematically present the EQ-5D-3L nationally representative population norms and to examine the socioeconomic and socio-demographic characteristics of the instrument among a representative sample of the Russian population.Based on a nationally representative health and well-being survey of the Russian population, conducted in November 2017, we establish the descriptive results, including the EQ-VAS and the EQ-5D Index, by age and gender, examine the correspondence between the EQ-5D health classifications and the separate EQ-VAS scores, and draw on a set of augmented logistic regressions to evaluate the association between the presence of problems in each dimension and various socio-economic and health-related characteristics.We find strong evidence that the EQ-5D instrument is sensitive to underlying observed and latent health experiences, that it mirrors many of the characteristics familiar from other settings but that there are Russian specificities which merit further research, particularly with respect to the anxiety/depression dimension of the instrument.This research represents an important landmark for HRQOL studies in Russia as well as for the prospects of continuing to develop the scholarly and practical infrastructure necessary for Russian Health Technology Assessment to advance."
https://openalex.org/W4220839344,"Previous work demonstrated enhanced enterocyte proliferation and mucosal growth in gnotobiotic mice, suggesting that intestinal flora participate in mucosal homeostasis. Furthermore, broad-spectrum enteral antibiotics are known to induce near germ-free (GF) conditions in mice with conventional flora (CONV). We hypothesized that inducing near GF conditions with broad-spectrum enteral antibiotics would cause ordered small intestinal mucosal growth in CONV mice but would have no effect in GF mice with no inherent microbiome. C57BL/6J CONV and GF mice received either an antibiotic solution (Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole, Vancomycin, Meropenem) or a vehicle alone. After treatment, small intestinal villus height (VH), crypt depth (CD), mucosal surface area (MSA), crypt proliferation index (CPI), apoptosis, and villus and crypt cell types were assessed. Antibiotic-treated CONV (Abx-CONV) mice had taller villi, deeper crypts, increased CPI, increased apoptosis, and greater MSA compared to vehicle-treated CONV mice. Minor differences were noted in enterocyte and enterochromaffin cell proportions between groups, but goblet and Paneth cell proportions were unchanged in Abx-CONV mice compared to vehicle-treated CONV mice (p&gt;0.05). Antibiotics caused no significant changes in VH or MSA in GF mice when compared to vehicle-treated GF mice (p&gt;0.05). Enteral administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to mice with a conventional microbiome stimulates ordered small intestinal mucosal growth. Mucosal growth was not seen in germ-free mice treated with antibiotics, implying that intestinal mucosal growth is associated with change in the microbiome in this model."

Protective measures vary in how effective they are in protecting the individual against infection, how much experience people have with them, whether they provide individual or societal protection, and how they are perceived on these dimensions.This study assessed the willingness to follow recommended measures, depending on these features, among participants from Germany (n = 333), Hong Kong (n = 367), and the U.S. (n = 495). From April 24th to May 1st, 2020, individuals completed an online survey that assessed the antecedents of interest.It was shown that assumed effectiveness, previous experience, and intended self- and other-protection positively predicted willingness to comply across countries. When measures were mainly perceived as protecting others (vs. the self), individuals were less prone to adopt them. When a measure's effectiveness to protect the individual was perceived as lower, willingness to adopt the measure increased with higher levels of prior experience and collectivism. Moreover, protecting others was more strongly related to adoption when individuals had higher levels of collectivism and lower levels of individualism.Emphasizing the benefit for others could be a means to lower the potential detrimental effects of low assumed effectiveness for individual protection."

Parameters of mineral metabolism, results of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans, and the history of fractures were obtained concurrently. One hundred nine bone biopsies taken at a median of 31 (interquartile range, IQR, 18-70) months after transplantation were included in statistical analysis. Bone turnover was classified as high in 78 (72%) and normal/low in 31 (28%) patients. The prevalence of low bone volume (n = 47, 43%) was higher among patients with low/normal turnover compared to patients with high turnover [18 (58%) vs. 29 (37%), P = 0.05]. Thirty-seven fragility fractures in 23 (21%) transplant recipients corresponding to fracture incidence 15 per 1000 person-years occurred during a median follow-up 9.1 (IQR, 6.3-12.1) years. Trabecular bone volume did not correlate with incident fractures. Accordingly, low bone mineral density at the lumbar spine correlated with low trabecular bone volume, but not with incident fractures. The cumulative corticosteroid dose was an important determinant of low bone volume, but not of incident fractures.Despite the high prevalence of trabecular bone loss among kidney transplant recipients, the number of fractures was limited. The lack of association between trabecular bone volume and fractures suggests that the bone cortical compartment and quality are important determinants of bone strength and post-transplantation fracture."

However, the impact of childhood parental bonding on presenteeism and the mediating effect of CCs with respect to the association among childhood parental bonding and presenteeism remain poorly understood. Aim We aimed to investigate the mediating role of CCs on the relationship between childhood parental bonding and presenteeism to better understand the influence of childhood parental bonding on adulthood presenteeism. Setting A total of 440 Japanese adult workers recruited using convenience sampling were evaluated. Methods The Parental Bonding Instrument, Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating Assessment and Work Limitations Questionnaire 8 were used to assess childhood parental bonding, CCs, and presenteeism, respectively. We performed Spearman’s correlation analysis and path analysis to investigate the relationship among the variables. Results Path analysis revealed that childhood parental bonding and CCs significantly affected presenteeism. More specifically, CCs fully and partially mediated the effect of paternal and maternal care on presenteeism, respectively. Moreover, CCs partially mediated the effects of both paternal and maternal overprotection on presenteeism. Conclusion The mediating role of CCs on the relationship between childhood parental bonding and presenteeism was shown in this study. In occupational MH, evaluating the mediating effect of CCs may be useful for addressing adulthood presenteeism associated with childhood parental bonding."
https://openalex.org/W4221085979,"Backgrounds Plasmodium vivax is the predominant Plasmodium species distributed extensively in the Americas and Asia-Pacific areas. Encoded protein by Plasmodium vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins (PvRBPs) family member are of critical prominence to parasite invasion and have been considered the significant targets in development of malaria vaccine for the blood stage. As high genetic polymorphism of parasites may impede the effectiveness of vaccine development, more research to unraveling genetic polymorphism of pvrbp2b from various geographical regions seems indispensable to map the exact pattern of field isolates. Methodology/Principal findings The aim of this study was to determine the sequences of Iranian pvrbp2b (nt: 502–1896) gene and then, to ascertain polymorphism of pvrbp2b gene, recombination, the level of genetic distances, evaluation of natural selection, and the prediction of B-cell epitopes of Iranian and global P . vivax isolates. Pvrbp2b partial gene was amplified and sequenced from 60 Iranian P . vivax isolates. Iranian pvrbp2b sequences as well as 95 published sequences from five countries were used to evaluate the genetic diversity and neutral evolution signature in worldwide scale. A total of 38 SNPs were identified among 60 Iranian pvrbp2b sequences (32 non-synonymous and 6 synonymous mutations), and 32 amino acid substitutions were observed in 29 positions as compared to Sal-1 sequence. Worldwide sequence analysis showed that 44 amino acid changes had occurred in 37 positions of which seven polymorphic sites had trimorphic mutations while the rest was dimorphic. The overall nucleotide diversity for Iranian isolates was 0.00431 ± 0.00091 while the level of nucleotide diversity was ranged from 0.00337 ± 0.00076 (Peru) to 0.00452 ± 0.00092 (Thailand) in global scale. Conclusions/Significance Of amino acid substitutions, 12 replacements were located in the B-cell epitopes in which nine polymorphic sites were positioned in N-terminal and three polymorphic sites in predicted B-cell epitopes of C-terminal, signifying both variable and conserved epitopes for vaccine designing. Using the achieved outcome of the current investigation interrogate questions to the selection of conserved regions of pvrbp2b and understanding polymorphism and immune system pressure to pave a way for developing a vaccine based on PvRBP2b candidate antigen."

This study investigated a commercial OSLD and used a Co-60 gamma irradiator for irradiation. The OSLDs (N = 26) were sampled in total OSLDs (N = 46) depending on the radiation sensitivity for this study. After irradiating doses from 0.5 to 40 Gy at fixed intervals in a standard environment, the dose response of a reference OSLD (N = 5) was determined through the reading process at each dose. The dose-response curves obtained from the reference OSLD were fitted according to the dose. In the dose range below 3 Gy, a linear function was used to determine the relationship between dose and the OSLD response. Quadratic and cubic functions were applied for dose ranges of up to 15 Gy and 40 Gy, respectively. Test OSLDs (N = 21) were evaluated at various doses (2.5 to 30 Gy) using different fitting functions, according to dose ranges. When doses from 0.5 Gy to 3.0 Gy were curve-fitted to the linear function, the relationship was y = 70278.0 x − 3125.3 (r 2 = 0.999). When doses of up to 15 Gy were curve-fitted to the quadratic function, the relationship was y = 628.6 x 2 + 70444.6 x − 6142.3 (r 2 = 0.999). Furthermore, when doses of up to 40 Gy were curve-fitted to the cubic function, the relation was y = −15.5 x 3 + 527.3 x 2 + 75059.6 x − 16260.3 (r 2 = 0.998). Test OSLDs were evaluated for various dose ranges based on the above equation. It was confirmed that the average difference was 0.86 ± 0.27%, and it was evaluated that the largest difference occurred at 30 Gy (2.24 ± 0.24%). In this study, we prove that measurements using the OSLD at various dose ranges, including high doses, will be possible through the application of an in-house software program and a correction process."

(photovoltaic) system, it is desired to operate a P.V. system efficiently and reliably. To ensure such an operation, a monitoring system is required to diagnose the health of the system. This paper aims to analyze a P.V. system under various operating conditions to identify parameters–derived from the I-V (current-voltage) characteristics of the P.V. system–that could serve as electrical signatures to various faulty operations and facilitate in devising a monitoring algorithm for the system. A model-based approach has been adopted to represent a P.V. system, using a one-diode model of a practical P.V. cell, developed in MATLAB/Simulink. The modelled system comprises two arrays, while each array has two panels in series. It was simulated for various operating conditions: healthy condition represented by STC (Standard Testing Condition), O.C. (open-circuited), soiling, P.S. (partial-shading), H.S. (panels hotspots) and P.D. (panels degradation) conditions. For the analysis of I-V curves under these conditions, six derived parameters were selected: Vte (equivalent thermal voltage), MCPF (maximum current point factor), Ri (currents ratio), S (slope), and Dv and Di (voltages and currents differences, respectively). Using these parameters, data of the actual system under various conditions were compared with its model-generated data for healthy operating conditions. Thresholds were set for each parameter’s value to mark normal operation range. It was observed that almost each considered fault creates a unique combination of sensitive parameters whose values exceeds the pre-defined thresholds, creating an electrical signature that will appear only when the corresponding conditions on the system are achieved. Based on these signatures, an algorithm has been proposed in this study which aims to identify and classify the considered faults. In comparison to other such studies, this work has been focused on those sensitive parameters for faults identification which shows greater sensitivity and contribute more to creation of unique sets of sensitive parameters for considered faults."

In the United Arab Emirates, previous studies reported a low level of MHL among healthcare professionals working with vulnerable populations such as children and adolescents with chronic illnesses. Further in-depth exploration is necessary to build understanding of beliefs and knowledge about mental illness among pediatric health professionals.Written narratives exploring mental health knowledge were collected from pediatric nurses and analyzed using content analysis. These written narratives were extracted from responses to open-ended questions embedded in a questionnaire completed as part of previous studies. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research were followed in reporting this study.The overarching theme that emerged from the data was that nurses struggled to negotiate the complexities of psychological distress and mental illness. Two overlapping sub-themes were identified: (1) professional knowledge was incomplete, confused, and lacking in clarity and (2) professional knowledge was impacted by cultural beliefs and stigma. A third sub-theme reflected how participants identified with others' suffering and felt powerless to help themselves or others. Participants described stress and mental exhaustion.Participants' narratives were characterized by struggles arising from insufficient knowledge, confusion, and deeply-held cultural and religious beliefs. Therefore, they were unable to resolve the conflict between professional knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about mental illness and stigma arising from cultural and religious beliefs/attitudes. Culturally-specific education is needed for healthcare professionals that addresses contextual, cultural, and religious factors impacting on stigma while actively supporting the healthcare workforce and enabling access to mental health services."
https://openalex.org/W4220985277,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene complex, one of the most diverse gene complexes found in the human genome, largely dictates how our immune systems recognize pathogens. Specifically, HLA genetic variability has been linked to vaccine effectiveness in humans and it has likely played some role in the shortcomings of the numerous human vaccines that have failed clinical trials. This variability is largely impossible to evaluate in animal models, however, as their immune systems generally 1) lack the diversity of the HLA complex and/or 2) express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) receptors that differ in specificity when compared to human MHC. In order to effectively engage the majority of human MHC receptors during vaccine design, here, we describe the use of HLA population frequency data from the USA and MHC epitope prediction software to facilitate the in silico mining of universal helper T cell epitopes and the subsequent design of a universal human immunogen using these predictions. This research highlights a novel approach to using in silico prediction software and data processing to direct vaccine development efforts."
