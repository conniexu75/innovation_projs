https://openalex.org/W2083922649,"Rats had a memory loss of a fear response when they received an electroconvulsive shock 24 hours after the fear-conditioning trial and preceded by a brief presentation of the conditioned stimulus. No such loss occurred when the conditioned stimulus was not presented. The memory loss in animals given electroconvulsive shock 24 hours after conditioning was, furthermore, as great as that displayed in animals given electroconvulsive shock immediately after conditioning. This result throws doubt on the assertion that electroconvulsive shock exerts a selective amnesic effect on recently acquired memories and thus that electroconvulsive shock produces amnesia solely through interference with memory trace consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2077244173,"Large bilateral preoptic lesions produced complete sleeplessness in two cats. In eight additional cats, similar but smaller lesions resulted in a significant reduction of quiet (slow-wave) sleep by 55 to 73 percent, and active (paradoxical) sleep by 80 to 100 percent. These values were determined by pre- and postlesion 22-hour continuous observations. Complete sleeplessness was followed by lethal exhaustion within a few days, whereas incomplete sleeplessness persisted at maximum levels for 2 to 3 weeks. The suppression of sleep was characterized by a gradual onset during the first 1 to 2 weeks, and a complete or partial recovery after 6 to 8 weeks. The severity of sleep suppression was found to be related to the size and localization of lesions placed specifically within the preoptic area and not to transient disturbances in feeding and temperature regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2087110733,"Using polarized light we have studied the effects of various mitotic poisons on mitotic spindles of living Pectinaria oocytes; we have studied fixed specimens with phase and electron microscopy. Vinblastine caused attrition and eventual disappearance of spindle structure as rapidly as did colcemid, and subsequent recovery from this treatment was at least as fast as that from colcemid. Griseofulvin, however, was easily the best agent for rapid, reversible, and repeated dissolution of the spindle. Agents that arrest metaphase may act on nondividing cells by interfering with the organization of other gelated structures."
https://openalex.org/W1975913540,"Various transplanted leukemias and normal tissues of the mouse were tested for asparagine synthetase activity. Leukemias susceptible to suppression by asparaginase have little or no synthetase activity. In contrast, leukemias insensitive to asparaginase exhibit substantial and often very high asparagine synthetase activity. Asparaginase-resistant variants of sensitive leukemias also have considerable synthetase activity. Thus the requirement by certain malignant cells of exogenous asparagine, which entails sensitivity to asparaginase, may be ascribed to lack of asparagine synthetase. Development of asparaginase-resistant variants from asparaginase-sensitive lines is consistently associated with acquisition of asparagine synthetase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2070897854,"When rats received a brief footshock upon stepping off an elevated platform, and an electroconvulsive shock 30 seconds or 6 hours afterward, amnesia was not observed 24 hours later. If a second footshock (noncontingent) was delivered 0.5 second before the electroconvulsive shock, amnesia was observed. The amnesia was temporary if conditioning was strong and permanent if conditioning was weak."
https://openalex.org/W1991203820,"Subcutaneous injection of 240 micrograms of acetoxycycloheximide in mice rapidly produces marked inhibition of cerebral protein synthesis. Treated mice were trained to escape shock by choosing the lighted limb of a T-maze. When trained five or more minutes after injection, they had a normal capacity to learn. They remembered normally 3 hours after training, but 6 hours after training they had markedly impaired retention. Amnesia persisted thereafter. Injections immediately after training had a less marked but significant amnesic effect. These studies suggest that protein synthesis is not necessary for learning or for memory for 3 hours after training but that it is required for long-term memory. The protein synthesis which appears to be necessary for long-term e3memory occurs during training, or within minutes after training, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1967223812,"Ethylene was detected by gas chromatography, and verified by chemical means, as a metabolic product of 22 species of fungi. Because 58 of 228 species of fungi produced a gaseous compound with retention time identical to that of authentic ethylene, we believe that this compound is a common metabolic product of fungi."
https://openalex.org/W1501344714,"Abstract 1. Succinate dehydrogenase formed a complex with coupling factor 4 (F4) from beef heart mitochondria, either in the presence or in the absence of phospholipids. Succinate dehydrogenase bound to F4 remained insensitive to 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedione and did not react with ubiquinone. 2. If cytochrome b was included in the complex, a succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity sensitive to 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-butanedione was reconstituted. Although required, cytochrome b did not appear to undergo oxidation-reduction. 3. The appearance of succinate-ubiquinone reductase was dependent on the use of reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase. Succinate dehydrogenase prepared in the absence of succinate was bound to the complex but was only active with N-methylphenazinium methyl sulfate as acceptor. 4. Phospholipids were essential for the succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity. Purified lecithin or phosphatidylethanolamine, but not cardiolipin, substituted for the crude phospholipid extract in the reconstitution of the complex. Complexes made with mitochondrial phospholipids had a higher specific activity and were more stable than those made with soybean phospholipids. Incubation of cytochrome b with soybean phospholipids resulted in complete loss of reconstitutive property of cytochrome b. 5. It is concluded that mitochondrial cytochrome b, in addition to its function in the electron transport, has a structural role in the organization of the members of the electron transport chain."

https://openalex.org/W1510312885,"Abstract A highly purified preparation of the enzyme, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, has been obtained in a four-step purification procedure from the germinating seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris. The enzyme hydrolyzes p-nitrophenyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside. The pH optimum for this reaction is 4.6, and apparent Km and Vmax values are 4.7 x 10-4 m and 7 µmoles per min per mg, respectively. The preparation also shows β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity. The enzyme has no action on phenyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside and, therefore, appears to be specific for glycosidic bonds of β configuration. It cleaves the nonreducing terminal 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose residues from glycopeptides derived from desialyzed fetuin and orosomucoid; these glycopeptides had been previously treated with β-galactosidase. The enzyme also releases 1 of the 2 residues of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose from the oligosaccharide chain of the intact bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B."

https://openalex.org/W1987141313,"A CONSIDERABLE volume of evidence from animal experiments suggests that mammalian placentation is under some kind of immunological control. In the mouse, for example, it has been shown that placental size1,2 and, indirectly, foetal size and length of gestation3 can be influenced by the materno-foetal immunological relationship. An increase in placental weight with birth order has been described in several species (mouse4, rat5, guinea-pig6 and man7,8) and this may represent an immunological effect."
https://openalex.org/W2086434499,It was shown that puromycin administered to mice 1 or more days after maze-learning blocks expression of memory; the blockage can be removed by intracerebral injections of saline. We present evidence that intracerebral injections of saline are relatively ineffective in restoring memory when puromycin is administered either before or immediately after training; in these two situations puromycin appears to interfere with consolidation of memory.
https://openalex.org/W2109924100,"Cells were recorded in the midbrain central gray neuropil of the cat that responded with action potentials only during fighting behavior and not while the cat was resting or while control manipulations were performed. Some other cells in the same region responded maximally during fighting, and all cells responded to at least one manipulation. Brain stimulation at sites of cells related to fighting caused the animals to hiss."
https://openalex.org/W2010862553,"Coronary degeneration was absent in young trout taken in fresh water and rare in immature fish at sea, but the incidence and severity were sharply greater in migrating fish and almost uniformly present in spawning fish. Several fish taken after they had reentered salt water after spawning had no lesions; lesions in fish taken during their second spawning migration were not cumulative. These facts suggest that the process is reversible."

https://openalex.org/W2034452626,Experiments in which male sea lions (Zalophus californianus) were removed and reintroduced into a social group demonstrate that barking by larger males restricts movement and barking by other smaller males. Barking and aggression were primarily directed toward animals of most nearly equal size. Two 6-year-olds seeking to establish and maintain territorial status used aggressive tactics similar to those observed in breeding males in the field.

https://openalex.org/W2054292300,"ALTHOUGH recurrent and relapsing fevers occur in Colombia, the aetiological agents are seldom diagnosed. From Colombia only two of the six recognized forms of arthropod-borne relapsing fevers have been reported: epidemic cosmopolitan relapsing fever caused by Borrelia recurrentis (synonyms B. obermeiri, B. novyi) and transmitted by lice (Pediculus humanus), and the endemic central and South American form of relapsing fever caused by B. venezuelensis (synonym B. neotropicalis) transmitted in nature to man, monkeys and marsupials by the soft ticks (Ornithodorosrudis, O. talaje, O. turcicate, O. rostrata and O. megnini). During the past 10 yr no arthropod-borne relapsing fevers have been reported from Colombia but there have been several suspicious cases in the department of Santander, where O. rudis is not uncommon8."
https://openalex.org/W2084012010,"Agonistic interaction rate is significantly lower in groups of caged cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) from naturally occurring organized populations than in groups composed of strangers. Some type of social structure is apparently present between animals sharing a common area under natural conditions. After a 24-hour period, there is no significant difference in the behavior of the two groups, an indication that a social structure is rapidly formed in the disorganized groups."

In the course of establishing disease-free breeding colonies from CFI female mice delivered of their offspring by cesarean section, exencephalia was seen frequently. During a 2-week period, 90 litters were delivered; 11 contained exencephalic fetuses, at the rate of one per litter (11 of 90 litters, 12.2 percent; 11 of 1056 fetuses, 1.04 percent). The prevalence of this anomaly in untreated mice of this strain could contribute to overestimates of the effectiveness of low doses of radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2083595191,"The incidence and morphology of centrioles in the proximal convoluted tubules of the rat kidney are altered by the dietary content of vitamin E, but not vitamin A, and by an increase in the pressure of oxygen. Increases in the number of centrioles in rats depleted of vitamin E and in those exposed to oxygen suggest that an oxidative mechanism is involved in the centriole alterations. The known antisterility action of vitamin E may thus be related to the direct protection of the mitotic apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W1972378483,"Incubation of deamino-oxytocin with plasma obtained from women in labor reduced the potency of this analog of oxytocin when assayed on an isolated strip of mammary gland taken from a lactating rat. Plasmas of nonpregnant women had no detectable effect on this activity of deamino-oxytocin, and the effect of plasmas from women just previous to the beginning of labor was not significant. The original activities of the incubated deamino-oxytocin solutions could be restored by treatment with hydrogen peroxide. The inactivation may be caused by reductive cleavage of the disulfide bridge of deamino-oxytocin, this bridge being reformed by oxidation."

https://openalex.org/W2035617785,"UNTIL recently, it was thought that reptiles possessed an impervious integument. This is now known not to be the case. Cutaneous water loss has been shown to represent two-thirds or more of the total transpiration from a wide variety of reptile species1. Experiments at Khartoum on young Nile crocodiles (Crocodilus niloticus L.) have recently shown that in dry air at temperatures from 25° to 40° C, water loss varies from about 5 to 20 per cent of initial body weight in 24 h. The lethal limit of water loss is about 40 per cent of initial body weight. Cutaneous transpiration was estimated by weighing the crocodiles and placing them in plastic bags containing anhydrous calcium chloride, to prevent possible water loss by diffusion, and sealing these around the necks of the animals with adhesive tape. The crocodiles were then placed in desiccators at the required temperatures for 24 h before being reweighed both in and out of the bags. In this way total and respiratory water loss were determined and a measure of the cutaneous loss was obtained by subtraction. At the temperature range mentioned, cutaneous water loss represented an amount varying from about 10 to 75 per cent of the total."
