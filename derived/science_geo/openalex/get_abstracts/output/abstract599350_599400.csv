https://openalex.org/W2767423581,"Intestinal epithelial cells absorb nutrients, respond to microbes, function as a barrier and help to coordinate immune responses. Here we report profiling of 53,193 individual epithelial cells from the small intestine and organoids of mice, which enabled the identification and characterization of previously unknown subtypes of intestinal epithelial cell and their gene signatures. We found unexpected diversity in hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells and constructed the taxonomy of newly identified subtypes, and distinguished between two subtypes of tuft cell, one of which expresses the epithelial cytokine Tslp and the pan-immune marker CD45, which was not previously associated with non-haematopoietic cells. We also characterized the ways in which cell-intrinsic states and the proportions of different cell types respond to bacterial and helminth infections: Salmonella infection caused an increase in the abundance of Paneth cells and enterocytes, and broad activation of an antimicrobial program; Heligmosomoides polygyrus caused an increase in the abundance of goblet and tuft cells. Our survey highlights previously unidentified markers and programs, associates sensory molecules with cell types, and uncovers principles of gut homeostasis and response to pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2769170966,"A Western lifestyle with high salt consumption can lead to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. High salt may additionally drive autoimmunity by inducing T helper 17 (TH17) cells, which can also contribute to hypertension. Induction of TH17 cells depends on gut microbiota; however, the effect of salt on the gut microbiome is unknown. Here we show that high salt intake affects the gut microbiome in mice, particularly by depleting Lactobacillus murinus. Consequently, treatment of mice with L. murinus prevented salt-induced aggravation of actively induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and salt-sensitive hypertension by modulating TH17 cells. In line with these findings, a moderate high-salt challenge in a pilot study in humans reduced intestinal survival of Lactobacillus spp., increased TH17 cells and increased blood pressure. Our results connect high salt intake to the gut–immune axis and highlight the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target to counteract salt-sensitive conditions. High salt intake changed the gut microbiome and increased TH17 cell numbers in mice, and reduced intestinal survival of Lactobacillus species, increased the number of TH17 cells and increased blood pressure in humans. The role of the gut microbiota in human disease is becoming increasingly recognized. In this study, Dominik Müller and colleagues report that a diet high in salt alters the composition of the gut microbiota in mice, causing pronounced depletion of the commensal Lactobacillus murinus and reduced production of indole metabolites. Previous work has suggested that a high salt diet leads to the generation of pathogenic T helper 17 (TH17) cells, which have been linked to hypertension and autoimmunity. The authors show that treatment of mice on a high salt diet with L. murinus prevents salt-induced aggravation of actively induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis and salt-sensitive hypertension, through the suppression of TH17 cells. In a pilot study in a small number of humans, the authors also show that high-salt challenge induces an increase in blood pressure and TH17 cells, associated with a reduction in Lactobacillus in the gut. However, future work is required to determine whether the findings for mice are translatable to humans."

https://openalex.org/W2770565810,"A combination of advanced sequencing and mapping techniques is used to produce a reference genome of Aegilops tauschii, progenitor of the wheat D genome, providing a valuable resource for comparative genetic studies. Sequencing the genomes of crops plants provides useful resources for crop improvement and breeding. Jan Dvořák, Katrien Devos, Steven Salzberg and colleagues report a reference genome for Aegilops tauschii, the diploid progenitor of the D genome of hexaploid wheat. They use a combination of ordered-clone genome sequencing, whole-genome shotgun sequencing and BioNano optical genome mapping to assemble this large and highly repetitive genome. This provides a useful resource for comparative genomics studies of wheat. Aegilops tauschii is the diploid progenitor of the D genome of hexaploid wheat1 (Triticum aestivum, genomes AABBDD) and an important genetic resource for wheat2,3,4. The large size and highly repetitive nature of the Ae. tauschii genome has until now precluded the development of a reference-quality genome sequence5. Here we use an array of advanced technologies, including ordered-clone genome sequencing, whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and BioNano optical genome mapping, to generate a reference-quality genome sequence for Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata accession AL8/78, which is closely related to the wheat D genome. We show that compared to other sequenced plant genomes, including a much larger conifer genome, the Ae. tauschii genome contains unprecedented amounts of very similar repeated sequences. Our genome comparisons reveal that the Ae. tauschii genome has a greater number of dispersed duplicated genes than other sequenced genomes and its chromosomes have been structurally evolving an order of magnitude faster than those of other grass genomes. The decay of colinearity with other grass genomes correlates with recombination rates along chromosomes. We propose that the vast amounts of very similar repeated sequences cause frequent errors in recombination and lead to gene duplications and structural chromosome changes that drive fast genome evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2767554904,"The role of adaptive immunity in early cancer development is controversial. Here we show that chronic inflammation and fibrosis in humans and mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is accompanied by accumulation of liver-resident immunoglobulin-A-producing (IgA+) cells. These cells also express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and interleukin-10, and directly suppress liver cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, which prevent emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma and express a limited repertoire of T-cell receptors against tumour-associated antigens. Whereas CD8+ T-cell ablation accelerates hepatocellular carcinoma, genetic or pharmacological interference with IgA+ cell generation attenuates liver carcinogenesis and induces cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated regression of established hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings establish the importance of inflammation-induced suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte activation as a tumour-promoting mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2769936894,"T cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of highly aggressive malignancies with poor clinical outcomes. T cell lymphomas originate from peripheral T cells and are frequently characterized by genetic gain-of-function variants in T cell receptor (TCR) signalling molecules. Although these oncogenic alterations are thought to drive TCR pathways to induce chronic proliferation and cell survival programmes, it remains unclear whether T cells contain tumour suppressors that can counteract these events. Here we show that the acute enforcement of oncogenic TCR signalling in lymphocytes in a mouse model of human T cell lymphoma drives the strong expansion of these cells in vivo. However, this response is short-lived and robustly counteracted by cell-intrinsic mechanisms. A subsequent genome-wide in vivo screen using T cell-specific transposon mutagenesis identified PDCD1, which encodes the inhibitory receptor programmed death-1 (PD-1), as a master gene that suppresses oncogenic T cell signalling. Mono- and bi-allelic deletions of PDCD1 are also recurrently observed in human T cell lymphomas with frequencies that can exceed 30%, indicating high clinical relevance. Mechanistically, the activity of PD-1 enhances levels of the tumour suppressor PTEN and attenuates signalling by the kinases AKT and PKC in pre-malignant cells. By contrast, a homo- or heterozygous deletion of PD-1 allows unrestricted T cell growth after an oncogenic insult and leads to the rapid development of highly aggressive lymphomas in vivo that are readily transplantable to recipients. Thus, the inhibitory PD-1 receptor is a potent haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in T cell lymphomas that is frequently altered in human disease. These findings extend the known physiological functions of PD-1 beyond the prevention of immunopathology after antigen-induced T cell activation, and have implications for T cell lymphoma therapies and for current strategies that target PD-1 in the broader context of immuno-oncology."
https://openalex.org/W2767236644,"Ebola and Marburg viruses are filoviruses: filamentous, enveloped viruses that cause haemorrhagic fever. Filoviruses are within the order Mononegavirales, which also includes rabies virus, measles virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Mononegaviruses have non-segmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA genomes that are encapsidated by nucleoprotein and other viral proteins to form a helical nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid acts as a scaffold for virus assembly and as a template for genome transcription and replication. Insights into nucleoprotein-nucleoprotein interactions have been derived from structural studies of oligomerized, RNA-encapsidating nucleoprotein, and cryo-electron microscopy of nucleocapsid or nucleocapsid-like structures. There have been no high-resolution reconstructions of complete mononegavirus nucleocapsids. Here we apply cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the structure of Ebola virus nucleocapsid within intact viruses and recombinant nucleocapsid-like assemblies. These structures reveal the identity and arrangement of the nucleocapsid components, and suggest that the formation of an extended α-helix from the disordered carboxy-terminal region of nucleoprotein-core links nucleoprotein oligomerization, nucleocapsid condensation, RNA encapsidation, and accessory protein recruitment."

https://openalex.org/W2770984626,"Earth’s body tide—also known as the solid Earth tide, the displacement of the solid Earth’s surface caused by gravitational forces from the Moon and the Sun—is sensitive to the density of the two Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) beneath Africa and the Pacific. These massive regions extend approximately 1,000 kilometres upward from the base of the mantle and their buoyancy remains actively debated within the geophysical community. Here we use tidal tomography to constrain Earth’s deep-mantle buoyancy derived from Global Positioning System (GPS)-based measurements of semi-diurnal body tide deformation. Using a probabilistic approach, we show that across the bottom two-thirds of the two LLSVPs the mean density is about 0.5 per cent higher than the average mantle density across this depth range (that is, its mean buoyancy is minus 0.5 per cent), although this anomaly may be concentrated towards the very base of the mantle. We conclude that the buoyancy of these structures is dominated by the enrichment of high-density chemical components, probably related to subducted oceanic plates or primordial material associated with Earth’s formation. Because the dynamics of the mantle is driven by density variations, our result has important dynamical implications for the stability of the LLSVPs and the long-term evolution of the Earth system. An estimate of Earth’s deep-mantle buoyancy is derived from GPS-based measurements of body tide deformation and shown to be dominated by dense material possibly related to subducted oceanic plates or primordial rock. The interior composition of Earth can be estimated by imaging seismic waves changing speed as they travel through different materials, but some anomalies in the deep mantle remain challenging to explain. Fast wave speed anomalies appear in areas with a history of subduction, indicating relatively cold and dense mantle material driving downward flow. However, slow wave speed anomalies in the form of large domes above the core–mantle boundary remain contentious—in particular their net buoyancy. Harriet Lau and co-authors estimate Earth's deep mantle buoyancy using GPS-based measurements of the daily deformation of Earth in response to the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon. They show that the mean excess density across the bottom two-thirds of these lower-mantle domes is about 0.5 per cent. The authors conclude that these structures are enriched with high-density chemical components, probably originating from subducted oceanic plates or primordial material associated with Earth's formation."

https://openalex.org/W2767937160,"A signalling mechanism in human cells for sensing DNA damage induced by alkylation involves ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of the alkylation repair complex ASCC to the vicinity of the damage and co-localization with transcription and splicing factors. The upstream signalling pathway that initiates the repair of alkylation damage in DNA is not well understood. Nima Mosammaparast and colleagues have found that the activating signal cointegrator complex (ASCC) is recruited to the vicinity of alkylation damage, co-localizing the transcription and splicing factors. The recruitment of ASCC depends on the ability of ASCC2 protein to bind K63-linked polyubiquitin chains made by the E3 ligase RNF113A, although the polyubiquitinated target remains unclear. Individuals with X-linked trichothiodystrophy carry a mutation in RNF113A, and these results clarify the underlying basis of their hypersensitivity to alkylating agents. DNA repair is essential to prevent the cytotoxic or mutagenic effects of various types of DNA lesions, which are sensed by distinct pathways to recruit repair factors specific to the damage type. Although biochemical mechanisms for repairing several forms of genomic insults are well understood, the upstream signalling pathways that trigger repair are established for only certain types of damage, such as double-stranded breaks and interstrand crosslinks1,2,3. Understanding the upstream signalling events that mediate recognition and repair of DNA alkylation damage is particularly important, since alkylation chemotherapy is one of the most widely used systemic modalities for cancer treatment and because environmental chemicals may trigger DNA alkylation4,5,6. Here we demonstrate that human cells have a previously unrecognized signalling mechanism for sensing damage induced by alkylation. We find that the alkylation repair complex ASCC (activating signal cointegrator complex)7 relocalizes to distinct nuclear foci specifically upon exposure of cells to alkylating agents. These foci associate with alkylated nucleotides, and coincide spatially with elongating RNA polymerase II and splicing components. Proper recruitment of the repair complex requires recognition of K63-linked polyubiquitin by the CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation) domain of the subunit ASCC2. Loss of this subunit impedes alkylation adduct repair kinetics and increases sensitivity to alkylating agents, but not other forms of DNA damage. We identify RING finger protein 113A (RNF113A) as the E3 ligase responsible for upstream ubiquitin signalling in the ASCC pathway. Cells from patients with X-linked trichothiodystrophy, which harbour a mutation in RNF113A, are defective in ASCC foci formation and are hypersensitive to alkylating agents. Together, our work reveals a previously unrecognized ubiquitin-dependent pathway induced specifically to repair alkylation damage, shedding light on the molecular mechanism of X-linked trichothiodystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2767721857,"Intestinal microbe-host interactions can affect the feed efficiency (FE) of chickens. As inconsistent findings for FE-associated bacterial taxa were reported across studies, the present objective was to identify whether bacterial profiles and predicted metabolic functions that were associated with residual feed intake (RFI) and performance traits in female and male chickens were consistent across two different geographical locations. At six weeks of life, the microbiota in ileal, cecal and fecal samples of low (n = 34) and high (n = 35) RFI chickens were investigated by sequencing the V3-5 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Location-associated differences in α-diversity and relative abundances of several phyla and genera were detected. RFI-associated bacterial abundances were found at the phylum and genus level, but differed among the three intestinal sites and between males and females. Correlation analysis confirmed that, of the taxonomically classifiable bacteria, Lactobacillus (5% relative abundance) and two Lactobacillus crispatus-OTUs in feces were indicative for high RFI in females (P < 0.05). In males, Ruminococcus in cecal digesta (3.1% relative abundance) and Dorea in feces (<0.1% relative abundance) were best indicative for low RFI, whereas Acinetobacter in feces (<1.5% relative abundance) related to high RFI (P < 0.05). Predicted metabolic functions in feces of males confirmed compositional relationships as functions related to amino acid, fatty acid and vitamin metabolism correlated with low RFI, whereas an increasing abundance of bacterial signaling and interaction (i.e. cellular antigens) genes correlated with high RFI (P < 0.05). In conclusion, RFI-associated bacterial profiles could be identified across different geographical locations. Results indicated that consortia of low-abundance taxa in the ileum, ceca and feces may play a role for FE in chickens, whereby only bacterial FE-associations found in ileal and cecal digesta may serve as useful targets for dietary strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2767990740,"Phosphorylation-type (P-type) ATPases are ubiquitous primary transporters that pump cations across cell membranes through the formation and breakdown of a phosphoenzyme intermediate. Structural investigations suggest that the transport mechanism is defined by conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domains of the protein that are allosterically coupled to transmembrane helices so as to expose ion binding sites to alternate sides of the membrane. Here, we have used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to directly observe conformational changes associated with the functional transitions in the Listeria monocytogenes Ca2+-ATPase (LMCA1), an orthologue of eukaryotic Ca2+-ATPases. We identify key intermediates with no known crystal structures and show that Ca2+ efflux by LMCA1 is rate-limited by phosphoenzyme formation. The transport process involves reversible steps and an irreversible step that follows release of ADP and extracellular release of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2768267249,"Energy expenditure is a target gaining recent interest for obesity treatment. The antiobesity effect of vanillic acid (VA), a well-known flavoring agent, was investigated in vivo and in vitro. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and genetically obese db/dbmice showed significantly decreased body weights after VA administration. Two major adipogenic markers, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer- binding protein α(C/EBPα), were reduced while the key factor of energy metabolism, AMPKα, was increased in the white adipose tissue and liver tissue of VA-treated mice. Furthermore, VA inhibited lipid accumulation and reduced hepatotoxic/inflammatory markers in liver tissues of mice and HepG2 hepatocytes. VA treatment also decreased differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes by regulating adipogenic factors including PPARγand C/EBPα. AMPKαsmall interfering RNA was used to examine whether AMPK was associated with the actions of VA. In AMPKα-nulled 3T3- L1 cells, the inhibitory action of VA on PPARγand C/EBPα was attenuated. Furthermore, in brown adipose tissues of mice and primary cultured brown adipocytes, VA increased mitochondria- and thermogenesis-related factors such as uncoupling protein 1 and PPARγ-coactivator 1-α. Taken together, our results suggest that VA has potential as an AMPKα- and thermogenesis-activating antiobesity agent.—Jung,Y.,Park,J.,Kim,H.-L.,Sim, J.-E.,Y oun,D.-H.,Kang, J., Lim, S., Jeong, M.-Y., Yang, W.

https://openalex.org/W2768448654,"Crystal structures of the nucleotide sugar transporter Vrg4 are reported in both the substrate-free and the bound states. Sugar transport is an essential part of the glycosylation pathway, a central cellular process, and nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) import sugars into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. NSTs also have a role in microbial virulence. In this work, the authors report the structural and functional characterization of Vrg4, a NST from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, laying the groundwork for our understanding of the substrate recognition and transport mechanisms of NSTs. Most structural studies of membrane proteins are of those based in the plasma membrane, so much less is known about intracellular membrane proteins. Vrg4 is regulated by short-chain lipids, suggesting that their activity is restricted to Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum membrane environments. Glycosylation is a fundamental cellular process that, in eukaryotes, occurs in the lumen of both the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum1. Nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) are an essential component of the glycosylation pathway, providing the diverse range of substrates required for the glycosyltransferases2,3. NSTs are linked to several developmental and immune disorders in humans, and in pathogenic microbes they have an important role in virulence4,5,6,7,8. How NSTs recognize and transport activated monosaccharides, however, is currently unclear. Here we present the crystal structure of an NST, the GDP–mannose transporter Vrg4, in both the substrate-free and the bound states. A hitherto unobserved requirement of short-chain lipids in activating the transporter supports a model for regulation within the highly dynamic membranes of the Golgi apparatus. Our results provide a structural basis for understanding nucleotide sugar recognition, and provide insights into the transport and regulatory mechanism of this family of intracellular transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2769866180,"Berries and associated bioactive compounds, e.g. polyphenols and dietary fibre (DF), may have beneficial implications with respect to the metabolic syndrome, including also cognitive functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects on cognitive functions and cardiometabolic risk markers of 5 wk intervention with a mixture of berries, in healthy humans.Forty healthy subjects between 50-70 years old were provided a berry beverage based on a mixture of berries (150g blueberries, 50g blackcurrant, 50g elderberry, 50g lingonberries, 50g strawberry, and 100g tomatoes) or a control beverage, daily during 5 weeks in a randomized crossover design. The control beverage (water based) was matched with respect to monosaccharides, pH, and volume. Cognitive tests included tests of working memory capacity, selective attention, and psychomotor reaction time. Cardiometabolic test variables investigated were blood pressure, fasting blood concentrations of glucose, insulin, blood lipids, inflammatory markers, and markers of oxidative stress.The daily amounts of total polyphenols and DF from the berry beverage were 795 mg and 11g, respectively. There were no polyphenols or DF in the control beverage. The berry intervention reduced total- and LDL cholesterol compared to baseline (both P<0.05), and in comparison to the control beverage (P<0.005 and P<0.01, respectively). The control beverage increased glucose concentrations (P<0.01) and tended to increase insulin concentrations (P = 0.064) from base line, and increased insulin concentrations in comparison to the berry beverage (P<0.05). Subjects performed better in the working memory test after the berry beverage compared to after the control beverage (P<0.05). No significant effects on the other test variables were observed.The improvements in cardiometabolic risk markers and cognitive performance after the berry beverage suggest preventive potential of berries with respect to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and associated cognitive decline. Possibly the polyphenols and DF contributed to the beneficial effects.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01562392."
https://openalex.org/W2770600372,"Eucalyptus oil (EO) used in traditional medicine continues to prove useful for aroma therapy in respiratory ailments; however, there is a paucity of information on its mechanism of action and active components. In this direction, we investigated EO and its dominant constituent 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) using the murine lung alveolar macrophage (AM) cell line MH-S. In an LPS-induced AM inflammation model, pre-treatment with EO significantly reduced (P ≤0.01or 0.05) the pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-1 (α and β), and NO, albeit at a variable rate and extent; 1,8-cineole diminished IL-1 and IL-6. In a mycobacterial-infection AM model, EO pre-treatment or post-treatment significantly enhanced (P ≤0.01) the phagocytic activity and pathogen clearance. 1,8-cineole also significantly enhanced the pathogen clearance though the phagocytic activity was not significantly altered. EO or 1,8-cineole pre-treatment attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory signaling pathways at various levels accompanied by diminished inflammatory response. Among the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in LPS signaling, the TREM pathway surface receptor (TREM-1) was significantly downregulated. Importantly, the pre-treatments significantly downregulated (P ≤0.01) the intracellular PRR receptor NLRP3 of the inflammasome, which is consistent with the decrease in IL-1β secretion. Of the shared downstream signaling cascade for these PRR pathways, there was significant attenuation of phosphorylation of the transcription factor NF-κB and p38 (but increased phosphorylation of the other two MAP kinases, ERK1/2 and JNK1/2). 1,8-cineole showed a similar general trend except for an opposite effect on NF-κB and JNK1/2. In this context, either pre-treatment caused a significant downregulation of MKP-1 phosphatase, a negative regulator of MAPKs. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory activity of EO and 1,8-cineole is modulated via selective downregulation of the PRR pathways, including PRR receptors (TREM-1 and NLRP3) and common downstream signaling cascade partners (NF-κB, MAPKs, MKP-1). To our knowledge, this is the first report on the modulatory role of TREM-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways and the MAPK negative regulator MKP-1 in context of the anti-inflammatory potential of EO and its constituent 1,8-cineole."

Prostate cancer is a complex multifaceted and biologically heterogeneous disease, and overtreatment of localized, low volume indolent tumors, is evident. Here, we aimed to assess Ki-67 expression and related outcomes of 535 patients treated with radical prostatectomy. The percentage of tumor epithelial cells expressing Ki-67 was determined by immunohistochemical assay, both digital image analysis and visual scoring by light microscope were used for quantification. The association of Ki-67 and prostate cancer was evaluated, as well as its prognostic value. There was a positive correlation between high expression of Ki-67 and Gleason score > 7 (p < 0.001) as well as tumor size (≥ 20 mm, p = 0.03). In univariate analyses, a high expression of Ki-67 in tumor epithelium was significantly associated with biochemical failure (BF) (digital scoring, p = 0.014) and (visual scoring, p = 0.004). In the multivariate analyses, a high level of Ki-67 was an independent poor prognostic factor for biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS) (Visual scoring, Ki67, p = 0.012, HR:1.50, CI95% 1.10-2.06).

To optimize the strategy for treatment, particularly in young women, prognostic biomarkers are urgently required. The objective of this study was to identify a tissue microRNA (miRNA) signature that predicts prognosis in young breast cancer patients. Total RNA from 45 breast cancer patients aged <35 years was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and analyzed using miRNA microarrays. Patients were categorized into two groups according to recurrence status within the 5 year period after surgery: recurrence (n = 11) and non-recurrent (n = 34). Histological parameters of hormone receptors and Ki-67 were statistically compared between the two groups. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, and their associations with overall survival (OS) were evaluated by log-rank test. The median observation period was 5.8 years for the recurrent group, and 9.1 years for the non-recurrent group. Nine miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups. Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the identified miRNAs, and the resultant area under the curve was >0.7. Five of the miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, and the expression levels of three of those five (miR-183-5p, miR-194-5p, and miR-1285-5p), both alone and in combination, were associated with OS. In conclusion, we identified three candidate miRNAs that could be used separately or in combination as prognostic biomarkers in young breast cancer patients.

In Australia, the use of azole fungicides has contributed to the 50-fold increase in canola production in the last 25 years.

A high-throughput in planta assay was developed to allow screening of thousands of isolates from multiple populations. Using this screen, isolates were identified with decreased sensitivity to the fungicide fluquinconazole when applied at field rates as a protective seed dressing: these isolates cause significantly larger lesions on cotyledons and true leaves and increased disease severity at plant maturity. This increased in planta resistance was specific to fluquinconazole, with no cross resistance to flutriafol or tebuconazole/prothioconazole. In a limited set of 22 progeny from a cross between resistant and susceptible parents, resistance segregated in a 1:1 ratio, suggesting a single gene is responsible. A survey of 200 populations from across canola growing regions of Australia revealed fungicide resistance was present in 15% of the populations. Although in vitro analysis of the fungicide resistant isolates showed a significant shift in the average EC50 compared to the sensitive isolates, this was not as evident as the in planta assays.

https://openalex.org/W2768438688,"New Hi-C technologies have revealed that chromosomes have a complex network of spatial contacts in the cell nucleus of higher organisms, whose organisation is only partially understood. Here, we investigate the structure of such a network in human GM12878 cells, to derive a large scale picture of nuclear architecture. We find that the intensity of intra-chromosomal interactions is power-law distributed. Inter-chromosomal interactions are two orders of magnitude weaker and exponentially distributed, yet they are not randomly arranged along the genomic sequence. Intra-chromosomal contacts broadly occur between epigenomically homologous regions, whereas inter-chromosomal contacts are especially associated with regions rich in highly expressed genes.

A real time and quantitative follow-up of MCTS with simple and robust readouts to evaluate drug efficacy is still missing. Here, we evaluate the chemotherapeutic drug 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) response on the growth and integrity of MCTS two days after treatment of MCTS and for three colorectal carcinoma cell lines with different cohesive properties (HT29, HCT116 and SW480). We found different sensitivity to 5-FU for the three CRC cell lines, ranging from high (SW480), intermediate (HCT116) and low (HT29) and the same hierarchy of CRC cell lines sensitivity is conserved in 2D. We also evidence that 5-FU has a strong impact on spheroid cohesion, with the apparition of a number of single detaching cells from the spheroid in a 5-FU dose- and cell line-dependent manner. We propose an innovative methodology for the chemosensitivity evaluation in 3D MCTS that recapitulates and regionalizes the 5-FU-induced changes within MCTS over time. These robust phenotypic read-outs could be easily scalable for high-throughput drug screening that may include different types of cancer cells to take into account tumor heterogeneity and resistance to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2770305855,"Trabecular bone of the human calcaneus is subjected to extreme repetitive forces during endurance running and should adapt in response to this strain. To assess possible bone functional adaptation in the posterior region of the calcaneus, we recruited forefoot-striking runners (n = 6), rearfoot-striking runners (n = 6), and non-runners (n = 6), all males aged 20–41 for this institutionally approved study. Foot strike pattern was confirmed for each runner using a motion capture system. We obtained high resolution peripheral computed tomography scans of the posterior calcaneus for both runners and non-runners. No statistically significant differences were found between runners and nonrunners or forefoot strikers and rearfoot strikers. Mean trabecular thickness and mineral density were greatest in forefoot runners with strong effect sizes (<0.80). Trabecular thickness was positively correlated with weekly running distance (r2 = 0.417, p<0.05) and years running (r2 = 0.339, p<0.05) and negatively correlated with age at onset of running (r2 = 0.515, p<0.01) Trabecular thickness, mineral density and bone volume ratio of nonrunners were highly correlated with body mass (r2 = 0.824, p<0.05) and nonrunners were significantly heavier than runners (p<0.05). Adjusting for body mass revealed significantly thicker trabeculae in the posterior calcaneus of forefoot strikers, likely an artifact of greater running volume and earlier onset of running in this subgroup; thus, individuals with the greatest summative loading stimulus had, after body mass adjustment, the thickest trabeculae. Further study with larger sample sizes is necessary to elucidate the role of footstrike on calcaneal trabecular structure. To our knowledge, intraspecific body mass correlations with measures of trabecular robusticity have not been reported elsewhere. We hypothesize that early adoption of running and years of sustained moderate volume running stimulate bone modeling in trabeculae of the posterior calcaneus."
https://openalex.org/W2768941193,"Adult muscles have a vast adaptation capacity, enabling function switches in response to altered conditions. During intensive physical activity, disease, or aging, adult skeletal muscles change and adjust their functions. The competence to adjust varies among muscles. Muscle-specific molecular mechanisms in healthy and normal conditions could designate changes in physiologic and pathologic conditions. We generated deep mRNA-sequencing data in adult fast and slow mouse muscles, and applying paired analysis, we identified that the muscle-specific signatures are composed of half of the muscle transcriptome. The fast muscles showed a more compact gene network that is concordant with homogenous myofiber typing, compared with the pattern in the slow muscle. The muscle-specific mRNA landscape did not correlate with alternative spicing, alternative polyadenylation, or the expression of muscle transcription factor gene networks. However, we found significant correlation between the differentially expressed noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their target genes. More than 25% of the genes expressed in a muscle-specific fashion were found to be targets of muscle-specific miRNAs and lncRNAs. We suggest that muscle-specific miRNAs and lncRNAs contribute to the establishment of muscle-specific transcriptomes in adult muscles.—Raz, V., Riaz, M., Tatum, Z., Kielbasa, S. M., 'tHoen, P. A. C.

https://openalex.org/W2770335995,"Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX), is a rare type of skin cancer affecting older individuals with sun damaged skin. Since there is limited genomic information about AFX, our study seeks to improve the understanding of AFX through whole-exome and RNA sequencing of 8 matched tumor-normal samples. AFX is a highly mutated malignancy with recurrent mutations in a number of genes, including COL11A1, ERBB4, CSMD3, and FAT1. The majority of mutations identified were UV signature (C>T in dipyrimidines). We observed deletion of chromosomal segments on chr9p and chr13q, including tumor suppressor genes such as KANK1 and CDKN2A, but no gene fusions were found. Gene expression profiling revealed several biological pathways that are upregulated in AFX, including tumor associated macrophage response, GPCR signaling, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). To further investigate the presence of EMT in AFX, we conducted a gene expression meta-analysis that incorporated RNA-seq data from dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Ours is the first study to employ high throughput sequencing for molecular profiling of AFX. These data provide valuable insights to inform models of carcinogenesis and additional research towards tumor-directed therapy."

Stimulated MCs release substances stored in their granules via regulated exocytosis. In other cell types, Munc13 (mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans uncoordinated gene 13) proteins play essential roles in regulated exocytosis. Here, we found that MCs express Munc13-2 and -4, and we studied their roles using global and conditional knock-out (KO) mice. In a model of systemic anaphylaxis, we found no difference between WT and Munc13-2 KO mice, but global and MC-specific Munc13-4 KO mice developed less hypothermia. This protection correlated with lower plasma histamine levels and with histological evidence of defective MC degranulation but not with changes in MC development, distribution, numbers, or morphology. In vitro assays revealed that the defective response in Munc13-4-deficient MCs was limited to regulated exocytosis, leaving other MC secretory effector responses intact. Single cell capacitance measurements in MCs from mouse mutants differing in Munc13-4 expression levels in their MCs revealed that as levels of Munc13-4 decrease, the rate of exocytosis declines first, and then the total amount of exocytosis decreases. A requirement for Munc13-2 in MC exocytosis was revealed only in the absence of Munc13-4. Electrophysiology and EM studies uncovered that the number of multigranular compound events (i.e. granule-to-granule homotypic fusion) was severely reduced in the absence of Munc13-4. We conclude that although Munc13-2 plays a minor role, Munc13-4 is essential for regulated exocytosis in MCs, and that this MC effector response is required for a full anaphylactic response.

During exocytosis, the membrane of a secretory vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane, allowing the release of vesicular contents into the extracellular space and the incorporation of vesicle membrane components into the plasma membrane (1Jahn R. Principles of exocytosis and membrane fusion.Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014 (15153432): 170-17810.1196/annals.1294.018Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Exocytosis can be constitutive or regulated (2Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Constitutive and regulated secretion of proteins.Annu. Rev.

In constitutive exocytosis, newly formed products are secreted as they are synthesized, and the amount of secreted product is controlled by the rate of expression of the vesicular cargo. In contrast, in regulated exocytosis the formed products are stored in secretory vesicles (e.g. MC 2The abbreviations used are: MCmast cellB6C57BL6/J mouse lineBMMCbone marrow-derived MCCmcapacitanceΔCmcapacitance gainΔTchange in body core temperatureDAGdiacylglycerolDKOMunc13-2/Munc13-4 double KODNP2,4-dinitrophenolFfaradGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateHSAhuman serum albuminLTC4leukotriene C4Neoneomycin phosphotransferasePCMCperitoneal cell-derived MCPGD2prostaglandin D2PGKphosphoglucokinase promoterPIPMA/ionomycinPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateqPCRquantitative PCRRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRIMRab3-interacting moleculeSsiemenSCFstem cell factorSNAREsoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activated protein receptorStxsyntaxinSvsurface densityTKherpes simplex virus thymidine kinaseVAMPvesicle-associated membrane proteinVvvolume density. granules) and released upon stimulation using diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+ as second messengers (3Berridge M.J.

The amount of secreted product is controlled by the rate and number of vesicles to plasma membrane fusion events. Regulated exocytosis can adopt various forms. In single-vesicle exocytosis, individual secretory granules fuse with the plasma membrane. In sequential compound exocytosis, these primary fused vesicles become targets for secondary fusion events with vesicles lying deeper in the cell. In multigranular compound exocytosis, secretory vesicles fuse homotypically with each other inside the cell before fusing heterotypically with the plasma membrane (5Pickett J.A. Edwardson J.M. Compound exocytosis: mechanisms and functional significance.Traffic. 2006; 7 (16420520): 109-11610.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00372.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Some cells (e.g. MCs) use all three forms of regulated exocytosis (6Lorentz A. Baumann A. Vitte J. Blank U. The SNARE machinery in mast cell secretion.Front.

Regulated exocytosis involves the generation of secretory vesicles and their transport toward the plasma membrane. Then, tethering and docking establish physical proximity between the vesicle and plasma membrane. The final event involves the fusion of both membranes (1Jahn R.

We hypothesized that the robust degranulation kinetics of MCs would allow us to test with high resolution the requirements of Munc13 proteins in non-neuronal cell exocytosis. To this end, we used single-cell, cell population, and whole-animal assays. We found that Munc13-4 regulates the amount and rate of exocytic events, that it is specifically required for MC-regulated exocytosis but not for other MC effector responses, that it mediates homotypic fusion in multigranular compound exocytosis, and that animals with a selective deficiency of Munc13-4 in their MCs could not mount a full anaphylactic response.

The resulting mutant mice (Munc13-4+/− and Munc13-4−/−, Munc13-4F/F, and Munc13-4Δ/Δ) were all viable and fertile; transmission of the mutant alleles followed a Mendelian pattern, and we found no gross anatomical abnormalities or survival differences when raised in a pathogen-free facility. The efficacy of Cre recombination in peritoneal MCs using a surrogate locus was >99% (Fig. S1), so we used peritoneal MCs in most of our studies. Quantification of transcripts from FACS-sorted peritoneal MCs demonstrated the predicted absence of Munc13-4 transcripts in MCs from Munc13-4−/− and Munc13-4Δ/Δ mice, and ∼50% reduction in those from Munc13-4+/− mice. Also, there was no compensatory overexpression of Munc13-2 in the absence of Munc13-4 (Fig. 1D). The transcripts for Munc13-2 were undetectable in peritoneal MCs from Munc13-2−/− mice. The reduction of Munc13-4 transcript levels in Munc13-4F/F MCs to ∼15% was unexpected. By 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we confirmed that the transcripts present in Munc13-4+/+ and Munc13-4F/F correspond to the ones already described for mouse Munc13-4. Immunoblots of lysates from peritoneal cell-derived MCs (PCMCs) and different organs (only spleen is shown) confirmed the reduced expression in Munc13-4F/F mice and the specificity of Cre-mediated deletion: Munc13-4Δ/Δ animals had the same levels of Munc13-4 as Munc13-4F/F mice in all tissues except in MCs, where it was absent (Fig. 1E). The fact that no bands were seen in samples from Munc13-4−/− mice in tissues known to express Munc13-2 proved the specificity of our antibody. Because Munc13-4F/F mice were hypomorphic, Munc13-4Δ/Δ mice were strictly compared with Munc13-4F/F littermates in all experiments. In small mammals, the massive peripheral vasodilation characteristic of anaphylaxis causes rapid loss of body heat, so core body temperature accurately reflects the severity of the anaphylactic response. Hypothermia in this model of IgE-dependent anaphylaxis depends on histamine (35Makabe-Kobayashi Y. Hori Y. Adachi T. Ishigaki-Suzuki S. Kikuchi Y. Kagaya Y. Shirato K. Nagy A. Ujike A. Takai T. Watanabe T. Ohtsu H. The control effect of histamine on body temperature and respiratory function in IgE-dependent systemic anaphylaxis.J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 110 (12170272): 298-30310.1067/mai.2002.125977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Given that histamine is released by MCs via regulated exocytosis, we tested whether the global or MC-specific deletion of Munc13-4 affected this allergic response. We sensitized mice with IgE anti-2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), challenged them with DNP-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA), and monitored their core body temperature (Fig. 2A). As negative controls, we introduced Munc13-4+/+ mice that were challenged with a sham solution. To control for anaphylactoid reactions to DNP-HSA, we used non-sensitized but challenged B6 mice, and no reactions were observed (data not shown). The lack of response in MC-deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice confirmed the MC dependence of this model. The absence of Munc13-2 did not affect the hypothermic response. However, there was significantly less drop in temperature in Munc13-4−/− mice compared with Munc13-4+/+ littermates, suggesting that a component of this reaction depends on Munc13-4. We recorded a similar difference between Munc13-4Δ/Δ and Munc13-4F/F mice, indicating that this Munc13-4-dependent component is limited to MCs (Fig. 2C). The partial deficit of Munc13-4 expression in Munc13-4+/− and Munc13-4F/F mice did not modify the nadir or recovery phase of the anaphylactic response, but it affected the early phase (Fig. 2B). Based on these findings we decided to drop the Munc13-2−/− mice from most of our studies. Also, because we did not find a difference between Munc13-4−/− and Munc13-4Δ/Δ mice in this and most other experiments, we opted not to compare Munc13-4+/− with Munc13-4+/Δ mice. During anaphylaxis, MC proteases contained in MC granules can be detected in serum (36Hogan A.D. Schwartz L.B. Markers of mast cell degranulation.Methods. 1997; 13 (9281467): 43-5210.1006/meth.1997.0494Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We measured plasma histamine, also stored in MC granules (37Fawcett D.W. Cytological and pharmacological observations on the release of histamine by mast cells.J. Exp. Med. 1954; 100 (13286425): 217-22410.1084/jem.100.2.217Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), as a surrogate of MC degranulation in mice undergoing anaphylaxis. We took special care during plasma collection to prevent the release of histamine from platelets. We found decreased plasma levels of histamine in challenged Munc13-4−/− and Munc13-4Δ/Δ mice (Fig. 2D). In histological samples of connective tissues from challenged Munc13-4+/+, Munc13-4+/−, and Munc13-4F/F mice, we observed multiple metachromatic granules surrounding degranulated MCs. Conversely, most visible MC granules from challenged Munc13-4−/− and Munc13-4Δ/Δ mice remained densely packed inside the MCs, which were almost indistinguishable from those of unchallenged Munc13-4+/+ mice (Fig. 2E). When quantified with a grading system (Fig. S2), we observed almost no MCs that we would grade as severely degranulated in the absence of Munc13-4 (Fig. 2F). There was a clear correlation between Munc13-4 expression in MCs, the severity of MC degranulation, the histamine plasma levels, and the hypothermic response to anaphylaxis. Abnormalities in the number, distribution, and development of MCs caused by Munc13-4 deficiency could also blunt the anaphylactic response. Consequently, we studied the baseline characteristics of the mutant mice and their MCs. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, we found no differences in the density of MCs in the dermis, the distribution of MCs in other tissues (data not shown), and the proportion and absolute number of MCs in peritoneal lavages. Qualitatively, the metachromasia of granules from all MCs was almost identical. The same proportion and number of bone marrow cells underwent differentiation into BMMCs in media enriched with stem cell factor (SCF) and IL3. Finally, all MCs and BMMCs expressed similar levels of receptors important for MC development and activation on their surfaces (FcɛRIα, Kit, and IL33R). We assessed cell morphology by stereology of EM profiles of peritoneal MCs fixed immediately after harvesting. Because the area of the cell profiles and cell-surface density (Sv cell) was similar, we concluded that there was no difference in the size, shape, and surface complexity of the MCs. The fact that both granule volume density (Vv) and granule surface density (Sv granule) did not differ indicated that the number, size, and shape of the MC secretory granules at baseline are unchanged. Therefore, we found no baseline abnormality that could explain the phenotype of Munc13-4−/− and Munc13-4Δ/Δ mice or that could interfere with the interpretation of the cell assays described below.Table 1Characterization of MCs from Munc13-4 mutant miceMunc13-4+/+Munc13-4−/−Munc13-4F/FMunc13-4Δ/ΔDermal MCs Density (MCs/mm2 of dermis)aCells with FITC+ granules and a Hoechst+ nucleus per mm2 of dermis in random ear sections (10 sections/mouse) are shown.220.9 ± 20204.9.7 ± 42210.2 ± 17.6209.3 ± 20.9Peritoneal MCs Count (MCs/μl of lavage)bNeubauer chamber counts and differentials of cytospins of peritoneal lavages are shown.23.67 ± 623.9 ± 6.723.3 ± 1.423.07 ± 12 MCs (% of lavaged cells)bNeubauer chamber counts and differentials of cytospins of peritoneal lavages are shown.3.35 ± 0.63.07 ± 0.42.98 ± 0.73.1 ± 1.3 VvcStereological analysis of randomly acquired EM images of peritoneal MCs (10 cell profiles/mouse) are shown.0.51 ± 0.010.52 ± 0.010.54 ± 0.010.53 ± 0.03 Sv cell (μm−1)cStereological analysis of randomly acquired EM images of peritoneal MCs (10 cell profiles/mouse) are shown.0.49 ± 0.020.50 ± 0.030.49 ± 0.020.49 ± 0.04 Sv granule (μm−1)cStereological analysis of randomly acquired EM images of peritoneal MCs (10 cell profiles/mouse) are shown.6.98 ± 0.17.05 ± 0.27.01 ± 0.26.97 ± 0.4 A (μm2)cStereological analysis of randomly acquired EM images of peritoneal MCs (10 cell profiles/mouse) are shown.84.61 ± 285.32 ± 1.883.75 ± 2.385.76 ± 2.4 Kit+/FcɛRIα+ (% of total)dFraction of Kit+/FcɛRIα+ double-positive cells by flow cytometry are shown.2.2 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.52.2 ± 0.3 IL33R (% of DP)eFraction of Kit+/FcɛRIα+ double-positive cells were also IL33R-positive.98.3 ± 0.397.1 ± 0.298.5 ± 0.397.6 ± 1.0 Kit MFI (AU)fCell-surface expression of Kit, FcɛRIα, and IL33R was expressed as MFI of specific labeled primary antibodies.7.3 ± 0.88.4 ± 0.67.4 ± 0.88.7 ± 0.5 FcɛRIα MFI (AU)fCell-surface expression of Kit, FcɛRIα, and IL33R was expressed as MFI of specific labeled primary antibodies.5.0 ± 0.55.0 ± 0.54.4 ± 0.44.9 ± 0.7 IL33R MFI (AU)fCell-surface expression of Kit, FcɛRIα, and IL33R was expressed as MFI of specific labeled primary antibodies.8.2 ± 0.87.5 ± 0.37.6 ± 0.88.3 ± 1.1BMMCs Kit+/FcɛRIα+ (%)dFraction of Kit+/FcɛRIα+ double-positive cells by flow cytometry are shown.97.9 ± 0.496.8 ± 1.095.2 ± 1.896.0 ± 1.2 Kit MFI (AU)fCell-surface expression of Kit, FcɛRIα, and IL33R was expressed as MFI of specific labeled primary antibodies.5.0 ± 0.65.2 ± 0.65.2 ± 0.54.8 ± 0.8 FcɛRIα MFI (AU)fCell-surface expression of Kit, FcɛRIα, and IL33R was expressed as MFI of specific labeled primary antibodies.4.8 ± 0.35.1 ± 0.55.4 ± 0.54.7 ± 0.7a Cells with FITC+ granules and a Hoechst+ nucleus per mm2 of dermis in random ear sections (10 sections/mouse) are shown.b Neubauer chamber counts and differentials of cytospins of peritoneal lavages are shown.c Stereological analysis of randomly acquired EM images of peritoneal MCs (10 cell profiles/mouse) are shown.d Fraction of Kit+/FcɛRIα+ double-positive cells by flow cytometry are shown.e Fraction of Kit+/FcɛRIα+ double-positive cells were also IL33R-positive.f Cell-surface expression of Kit, FcɛRIα, and IL33R was expressed as MFI of specific labeled primary antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2770249982,"The epididymis is a male reproductive organ involved in posttesticular sperm maturation and storage, but the mechanism underlying sperm maturation remains unclear. β-Defensins (Defbs) belong to a family of small, cysteine-rich, cationic peptides that are antimicrobial and modulate the immune response. A large number of Defb genes are expressed abundantly in the male reproductive tract, especially in the epididymis. We and other groups have shown the involvement of several Defb genes in regulation of sperm function. In this study, we found that Defb23, Defb26, and Defb42 were highly expressed in specific regions of the epididymis. Rats with CRISPR/Cas9- mediated single-gene disruption of Defb23, Defb26, or Defb42 had no obvious fertility phenotypes. Those with the deletion of Defb23/26 or Defb23/26/42 became subfertile, and sperm isolated from the epididymal cauda of multiple- mutant rats were demonstrated decreased motility. Meanwhile, the sperm showed precocious capacitation and increased spontaneous acrosome reaction. Consistent with premature capacitation and acrosome reaction, sperm from multiple-gene-knockout rats had significantly increased intracellular calcium. These results suggest that Defb family members affect sperm maturation by a synergistic pattern in the epididymis.—Zhang, C., Zhou, Y., Xie, S., Yin, Q., Tang, C., Ni, Z., Fei, J., Zhang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2768690382,"High species diversity of the potential animal host community for a zoonotic pathogen may reduce pathogen transmission among the most competent host, a phenomenon called the ""dilution effect"", but the mechanisms driving this effect have been little studied. One proposed mechanism is ""encounter reduction"" where host species of low-competency decrease contact rates between infected and susceptible competent hosts, especially in directly transmitted diseases. We conducted an experiment in outdoor enclosures in northwestern Mexico where we manipulated rodent assemblages to assess the effect of species richness on the frequency of intra- and interspecific interactions and activity patterns of a hantavirus reservoir host (North American deermouse; Peromyscus maniculatus). Trials consisted of three treatments of rodent assemblages that differed in species richness, but had equal abundance of deermice; treatment 1 consisted of only deermice, treatment 2 included deermice and one non-competent host species, and treatment 3 included two non-competent host species in addition to deermice. To measure interactions and temporal activity, we strategically deployed foraging stations and infrared cameras. We did not find differences in the frequency of intraspecific interactions of deermice among treatments, but there were significantly more interspecific interactions between deermouse and non-competent hosts in treatment 2 than treatment 3, which is explained by the identity of the non-competent host species. In addition, there were differences in activity patterns between rodent species, and also between deermice from treatment 1 and treatment 2. These results indicate that at least at a small-scale analysis, the co-occurrence with other species in the study area does not influence the frequency of intraspecific interactions of deermice, and that deermice may be changing their activity patterns to avoid a particular non-competent host species (Dipodomys merriami). In conclusion, in this deermouse-hantavirus system a potential dilution effect would not be through intraspecific encounter reduction in the most competent hantavirus host. To identify variables of host assemblages that can influence pathogen transmission, we highlight the need to address the identity of species and the composition of assemblages, not only host species richness or diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2768187798,"Steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain computer interface (BCI) has advantages of high information transfer rate (ITR), less electrodes and little training. So it has been widely investigated. However, the available stimulus frequencies are limited by brain responses. Simultaneous modulation of stimulus luminance is a novel method to resolve this problem. In this study, three experiments were devised to gain a deeper understanding of the brain response to the stimulation using inter-modulation frequencies. First, luminance-based stimulation using one to five inter-modulation frequencies was analyzed for the first time. The characteristics of the brain responses to the proposed stimulation were reported. Second, the motion-based stimulation with equal luminance using inter-modulation frequencies was also proposed for the first time. The response of the brain under these conditions were similar to that of luminance-based stimulation which can induce combination frequencies. And an elementary analysis was conducted to explain the reason of the occurrence of combination frequencies. Finally, the online test demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed two stimulation methods for BCI. The average ITRs reached 34.7836 bits/min and 39.2856 bits/min for luminance-based and motion-based stimulation respectively. This study demonstrated that the simultaneous modulation of stimulus luminance could extend to at least five frequencies to induce SSVEP and the brain response to the stimulus still maintained a certain positive correlation with luminance. And not only luminance-based stimulation, but also motion-based stimulation with equal luminance can elicit inter-modulation frequencies to effectively increase the number of targets for multi-class SSVEP."

We report experimental data on the cross-flow migration, bending, and buckling of extremely deformable hydrogel nanofilaments conveyed by an oscillatory flow into a microchannel. The changes in migration velocity and filament orientation are related to the flow velocity and the filament’s initial position, deformation, and length. The observed migration dynamics of hydrogel filaments qualitatively confirms the validity of the previously developed worm-like bead-chain hydrodynamic model. The experimental data collected may help to verify the role of hydrodynamic interactions in molecular simulations of long molecular chains dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2768122085,"Observational learning plays an important role in surgical skills training, following the traditional model of learning from expertise. Recent findings have, however, highlighted the benefit of observing not only expert performance but also error-strewn performance. The aim of this study was to determine which model (novice vs. expert) would lead to the greatest benefits when learning robotically assisted surgical skills.120 medical students with no prior experience of robotically-assisted surgery completed a ring-carrying training task on three occasions; baseline, post-intervention and at one-week follow-up. The observation intervention consisted of a video model performing the ring-carrying task, with participants randomly assigned to view an expert model, a novice model, a mixed expert/novice model or no observation (control group). Participants were assessed for task performance and surgical instrument control.There were significant group differences post-intervention, with expert and novice observation groups outperforming the control group, but there were no clear group differences at a retention test one week later. There was no difference in performance between the expert-observing and error-observing groups.Similar benefits were found when observing the traditional expert model or the error-strewn model, suggesting that viewing poor performance may be as beneficial as viewing expertise in the early acquisition of robotic surgical skills. Further work is required to understand, then inform, the optimal curriculum design when utilising observational learning in surgical training."
https://openalex.org/W2768223532,"Coxiella burnetii is a globally distributed zoonotic bacterial pathogen that causes abortions in ruminant livestock. In humans, an influenza-like illness results with the potential for hospitalization, chronic infection, abortion, and fatal endocarditis. Ruminant livestock, particularly small ruminants, are hypothesized to be the primary transmission source to humans. A recent Netherlands outbreak from 2007-2010 traced to dairy goats resulted in over 4,100 human cases with estimated costs of more than 300 million euros. Smaller human Q fever outbreaks of small ruminant origin have occurred in the United States, and characterizing shedding is important to understand the risk of future outbreaks. In this study, we assessed bacterial shedding and seroprevalence in 100 sheep from an Idaho location associated with a 1984 human Q fever outbreak. We observed 5% seropositivity, which was not significantly different from the national average of 2.7% for the U.S. (P>0.05). Furthermore, C. burnetii was not detected by quantitative PCR from placentas, vaginal swabs, or fecal samples. Specifically, a three-target quantitative PCR of placenta identified 0.0% shedding (exact 95% confidence interval: 0.0%-2.9%). While presence of seropositive individuals demonstrates some historical C. burnetii exposure, the placental sample confidence interval suggests 2016 shedding events were rare or absent. The location maintained the flock with little or no depopulation in 1984 and without C. burnetii vaccination during or since 1984. It is not clear how a zero-shedding rate was achieved in these sheep beyond natural immunity, and more work is required to discover and assess possible factors that may contribute towards achieving zero-shedding status. We provide the first U.S. sheep placental C. burnetii shedding update in over 60 years and demonstrate potential for C. burnetii shedding to reach undetectable levels after an outbreak event even in the absence of targeted interventions, such as vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2769808266,"Standard open and percutaneous minimally invasive surgical procedures co-exist in the treatment of fractures of the thoracolumbar spine. Shorter skin incisions just above the pedicles are used in minimally invasive procedures. Full-length skin incisions and invasive preparations are applied in the standard open approach. While both methods show equivalent rates of intraoperative surgical complications and comparable clinical and radiological outcomes, blood loss and operation time have shown to be decreased in minimally invasive treatment. However, no study so far has investigated differences in microcirculation. This study hypothesized less impairment of microcirculation in the minimally invasive approach compared to the open approach and an improvement of microcirculation over time. A prospective cohort study was conducted using non-invasive laser-Doppler spectrophotometry (an O2C “oxygen to see” device) for measurement of cutaneous and subcutaneous blood oxygenation (SO2), haemoglobin concentration (Hb), and blood flow at depths of 2, 8, and 15 mm at six locations on the skin. Measurements were performed before surgery, 8 and 24 h after surgery, and 2, 4, 7, 12 and 20 days after surgery, however the number of patients measured decreased towards the later time points. Forty patients were included in the study, 20 with each approach (18 females and 22 males). Pair-wise comparison of the types of surgical procedure for each measurement point revealed a significantly higher flow value in the minimally invasive group at one of the measurement points located between the incisions (P = .041). The point-wise analyses of SO2 and Hb did not show significant differences between the approaches. In conclusion, significantly albeit moderately higher flow values could be found in minimally invasive procedures compared to open operations of thoracolumbar fractures in the area of skin that is spared by the incisions."
https://openalex.org/W2768360393,"The disjunct distribution of the harvestman Discocyrtus dilatatus (Opiliones, Gonyleptidae) is used as a case study to test the hypothesis of a trans-Chaco Pleistocene paleobridge during range expansion stages. This would have temporarily connected humid regions (‘Mesopotamia’ in northeastern Argentina, and the ‘Yungas’ in the northwest, NWA) in the subtropical and temperate South American lowlands. The present study combines two independent approaches: paleodistributional reconstruction, using the Species Distribution Modeling method MaxEnt and projection onto Quaternary paleoclimates (6 kya, 21 kya, 130 kya), and phylogeographic analyses based on the cytochrome oxidase subunit I molecular marker. Models predict a maximal shrinkage during the warm Last Interglacial (130 kya), and the rise of the hypothesized paleobridge in the Last Glacial Maximum (21 kya), revealing that cold-dry stages (not warm-humid ones, as supposed) enabled the range expansion of this species. The disjunction was formed in the mid-Holocene (6 kya) and is intensified under current conditions. The median-joining network shows that NWA haplotypes are peripherally related to different Mesopotamian lineages; haplotypes from Santa Fe and Córdoba Provinces consistently occupy central positions in the network. According to the dated phylogeny, Mesopotamia-NWA expansion events would have occurred in the last glacial period, in many cases closely associated to the Last Glacial Maximum, with most divergence events occurring shortly thereafter. Only two (out of nine) NWA haplotypes are shared with Mesopotamian localities. A single, presumably relictual NWA haplotype was found to have diverged much earlier, suggesting an ancient expansion event not recoverable by the paleodistributional models. Different measures of sequence statistics, genetic diversity, population structure and history of demographic changes are provided. This research offers the first available evidence for the historical origin of NWA disjunct populations of a Mesopotamian harvestman."
https://openalex.org/W2770251308,"The ventricles of the brain remain perhaps the largest anatomic structure in the human body without established primary purpose, even though their existence has been known at least since described by Aristotle. We hypothesize that the ventricles help match a stroke volume of arterial blood that arrives into the rigid cranium with an equivalent volume of ejected venous blood by spatially configuring cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to act as a low viscosity relay medium for arteriovenous pulse wave (PW) phase coupling. We probe the hypothesis by comparing the spatiotemporal behavior of vascular PW about the ventricular surfaces in piglets to internal observations of ventricle wall motions and adjacent CSF pressure variations in humans. With wavelet brain angiography data obtained from piglets, we map the travel relative to brain pulse motion of arterial and venous PWs over the ventricle surfaces. We find that arterial PWs differ in CF phase from venous PWs over the surfaces of the ventricles consistent with arteriovenous PW phase coupling. We find a spatiotemporal difference in vascular PW phase between the ventral and dorsal ventricular surfaces, with the PWs arriving slightly sooner to the ventral surfaces. In humans undergoing neuroendoscopic surgery for hydrocephalus, we measure directly ventricle wall motions and the adjacent internal CSF pressure variations. We find that CSF pressure peaks slightly earlier in the ventral Third Ventricle than the dorsal Lateral Ventricle. When matched anatomically, the peri-ventricular vascular PW phase distribution in piglets complements the endo-ventricular CSF PW phase distribution in humans. This is consistent with a role for the ventricles in arteriovenous PW coupling and may add a framework for understanding hydrocephalus and other disturbances of intracranial pressure."

In this study, the claw muscle, hepatopancreas and nervous tissue of the mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) were collected at three fattening stages for sequence by the Illumina sequencing. A total of 127.87 Gb clean data with no less than 3.94 Gb generated for each sample and the cycleQ30 percentages were more than 86.13% for all samples. De Bruijn assembly of these clean data produced 94,853 unigenes, thereinto, 50,059 unigenes were found in claw muscle. A total of 121 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were revealed in claw muscle from the three fattening stages with a Padj value < 0.01, including 63 genes with annotation. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs clusters represented the predominant gene catalog with roles in biochemical processes (glycolysis, phosphorylation and regulation of transcription), molecular function (ATP binding, 6-phosphofructokinase activity, and sequence-specific DNA binding) and cellular component (6-phosphofructokinase complex, plasma membrane, and integral component of membrane). qRT-PCR was employed to further validate certain DEGs. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis obtained 159,322, 125,963 and 166,279 potential SNPs from the muscle transcriptome at stage B, stage C and stage D, respectively. In addition, there were sixteen neuropeptide transcripts being predicted in the claw muscle. The present study provides a comprehensive transcriptome of claw muscle of S. paramamosain during fattening, providing a basis for screening the functional genes that may affect muscle growth of S. paramamosain."
https://openalex.org/W2770732214,"Parasitic nematodes have evolved powerful immunomodulatory molecules to enable their survival in immunocompetent hosts by subverting immune responses and minimizing pathological processes. One filarial molecule known to counteract host immune responses by inducing IL-10 and regulatory macrophages in mice is filarial cystatin. During a patent filarial infection monocytes encounter microfilariae in the blood, an event that occurs in asymptomatically infected filariasis patients that are immunologically hyporeactive. The microfilarial larval stage was formerly shown to induce human regulatory monocytes and macrophages. Thus, here we aim was to determine how filarial cystatin of the human pathogenic filaria Brugia malayi (BmCPI-2) contributes to immune hyporesponsiveness in human monocytes and macrophages elicited by microfilaria. For this purpose, filarial cystatin was depleted from microfilarial lysate (Mf). Detecting the immunomodulatory potential of cystatin-depleted Mf revealed that IL-10, but not IL-8 and IL-6 induction in monocytes and macrophages is dependent on the presence of cystatin. In addition, the Mf-induced expression of the regulatory surface markers PD-L1 and PD-L2 in human monocytes, but not in macrophages, is dependent on cystatin. While Mf-treated monocytes result in decreased CD4+ T-cell proliferation in a co-culture assay, stimulation of T-cells with human monocytes treated with cystatin-depleted Mf lead to a restoration of CD4+ T-cell proliferation. Moreover, IL-10 induction by cystatin within Mf was dependent on p38 and ERK in macrophages, but independent of the ERK pathway in monocytes. These findings indicate that filarial nematodes differentially trigger and exploit various signaling pathways to induce immunomodulation in different myeloid cell subsets."
https://openalex.org/W2768152495,"Background Malaria, remains one of the leading causes of high morbidity and mortality in Nigeria despite implementation of several public health interventions for its control. Operational limitations and methodological gaps have been associated with malaria control interventions and research, and these have necessitated the need for a well-tailored Malaria Operational Research (MOR) agenda. However, there is paucity of evidence-based information on relevant stakeholders’ experience, awareness, perceptions and use of MOR and suggestions on setting MOR agenda. As part of a larger study to provide data for national MOR agenda setting, we assessed the MOR research situation from the perspectives of key stakeholders in Nigeria and contribution of MOR to the malaria elimination agenda Methods We conducted key informant interviews among 40 purposively selected stakeholders from the six geo-political zones in Nigeria. Data was collected using a pre-tested key informant interview guide which comprised issues related to experience, awareness, use of MOR and MOR needs, and suggestions for MOR. We conducted a detailed content analysis. Results Half of the participants had participated in MOR. Participants perceived MOR as important. Only few were aware of existing framework for MOR in Nigeria while above half expressed that MOR is yet to be used to inform policy in Nigeria. Participants identified several MOR needs such as development of improved diagnostic techniques, and interventions for promoting early diagnosis, prompt treatment and quality programmatic data. Participants opined the need for country-specific prioritised MOR agenda that cut across malaria thematic areas including malaria prevention and case management. Participants suggested the involvement of various stakeholders and multi-disciplinary approach in setting MOR. Conclusion Although some stakeholders have been involved in MOR, it is still rarely used to inform policy and several needs exist across thematic areas. A broad-based stakeholder involvement, multi-disciplinary approach to agenda setting and its wide dissemination have been suggested."

Towed video has emerged as a promising method for surveying benthic communities in a both non-destructive and cost-efficient way. Here we examine its use as a tool for quantification and monitoring of oyster populations by (i) analysing how well abundances can be estimated and how living Ostrea edulis individuals can be distinguished from dead ones, (ii) estimating the variability within and among observers as well as the spatial variability at a number of scales, and finally (iii) evaluating the precision of estimated abundances under different scenarios for monitoring. Overall, the results show that the can be used to quantify abundance and occurrence of Ostrea edulis in heterogeneous environments. There was a strong correlation between abundances determined in the field and abundances estimated by video-analyses (r2 = 0.93), even though video analyses underestimated the total abundance of living oysters by 20%. Additionally, the method was largely repeatable within and among observers and revealed no evident bias in identification of living and dead oysters. We also concluded that the spatial variability was an order of magnitude larger than that due to observer errors. Subsequent modelling of precision showed that the total area sampled was the main determinant of precision and provided general method for determining precision. This study provides a thorough validation of the application of towed video on quantitative estimations of live oysters. The results suggest that the method can indeed be very useful for this purpose and we therefor recommend it for future monitoring of oysters and other threatened habitats and species."
https://openalex.org/W2768710648,"Several neurodevelopmental diseases are characterized by impairments in cortical morphology along with altered white matter connectivity. However, the relationship between these two measures is not yet clear. In this study, we propose a novel methodology to compute and display metrics of white matter connectivity at each cortical point. After co-registering the extremities of the tractography streamlines with the cortical surface, we computed two measures of connectivity at each cortical vertex: the mean tracts' length, and the proportion of short- and long-range connections. The proposed measures were tested in a clinical sample of 62 patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) and 57 typically developing individuals. Using these novel measures, we achieved a fine-grained visualization of the white matter connectivity patterns at each vertex of the cortical surface. We observed an intriguing pattern of both increased and decreased short- and long-range connectivity in 22q11DS, that provides novel information about the nature and topology of white matter alterations in the syndrome. We argue that the method presented in this study opens avenues for additional analyses of the relationship between cortical properties and patterns of underlying structural connectivity, which will help clarifying the intrinsic mechanisms that lead to altered brain structure in neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2768738537,"A high-fat diet has been recognized as an important risk factor of obesity, with variable impacts of different fatty acid compositions on the physiological process. To understand the effects of a high-margarine/lard diet, which is a major source of trans fatty acids (TFAs)/ saturated fatty acids (SFAs), elaidic acid as a biomarker of margarine intake was used to screen affected adipokines on mature human adipocytes in vitro. Weaned male Wistar rats were fed a high-fat diet enriched with margarine/lard to generate obesity-prone (OP) and obesity-resistant (OR) models, which were then used to explore the inflammatory responses of depot-specific white adipose tissue. Adiposity, glucose and lipid metabolism parameters and macrophage cell markers were also compared in vivo. In the subcutaneous depot, a high-margarine diet induced elevated IL-6, MCP-1 and XCL1 expression levels in both M-OP and M-OR groups. High-lard diet-fed rats displayed higher protein expression levels of MCP-1 and XCL1 compared with the control group. In the epididymal depot, significantly elevated IL-6 production was observed in M-OP rats, and high-lard diet-fed rats displayed elevated IL-6 and decreased XCL1 expression. In the retroperitoneal depot, a high-margarine diet caused higher IL-6 and MCP-1 expression levels, a high-lard diet caused elevated IL-6 expression in L-OP/L-OR rats, and elevated XCL1 expression was observed only in L-OP rats. In general, CD206 mRNA levels were notably down-regulated by high-fat diet feeding in the above-mentioned depots. CD11c mRNA levels were slightly upregulated in the subcutaneous depot of OP rats fed a high-margarine/lard diet. In the epidydimal depot, higher expression levels of F4/80 and CD206 mRNA were observed only in high-margarine diet-fed OP rats. These results suggest that depot-specific inflammation with decreased expression of adipose tissue anti-inflammatory M2-type (ATM2) macrophages could be induced by high-margarine/lard intake."
https://openalex.org/W2768906428,"Background Radiofrequency endometrial ablation (REA) is currently a second line treatment in women with heavy menstrual bleeding (MHB) if medical therapy (MTP) is contraindicated or unsatisfactory. Our objective is to compare the effectiveness and cost burden of MTP and REA in the initial treatment of HMB. Methods We performed a randomized trial at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota. The planned sample size was 60 patients per arm. A total of 67 women with HMB were randomly allocated to receive oral contraceptive pills (Nordette ®) or Naproxen (Naprosyn®) (n = 33) or REA (n = 34). Primary 12-month outcome measures included menstrual blood loss using pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBLAC), patients’ satisfaction, and Menorrhagia Multi-Attribute Scale (MMAS). Secondary outcomes were total costs including direct medical and indirect costs associated with healthcare use, patient out-of-pocket costs, and lost work days and activity limitations over 12 months. Results Compared to MTP arm, women who received REA had a significantly lower PBLAC score (median [Interquartile range, IQR]: 0 [0–4] vs. 15 [0–131], p = 0.003), higher satisfaction rates (96.8%vs.63.2%, p = 0.003) and higher MMAS (median [IQR]: 100 [100–100] vs. 100 [87–100], p = 0.12) at 12 months. Direct medical costs were higher for REA ($5,331vs.$2,901, 95% confidence interval (CI) of mean difference:$727,$4,852), however, when indirect costs are included, the difference did not reach statistical significance ($5,469 vs. $3,869, 95% CI of mean difference:-$339, $4,089). Conclusion For women with heavy menstrual bleeding, initial radiofrequency endometrial ablation compared to medical therapy offered superior reduction in menstrual blood loss and improvement in quality of life without significant differences in total costs of care. Clinical trial registration NCT01165307."
https://openalex.org/W2769168623,"The seed, the reproductive unit of angiosperms, is generally protected by the seed coat. The seed coat is made of one or two integuments, each comprising two epidermal cells layers and, in some cases, extra sub-epidermal cell layers. The thickness of the seed-coat affects several aspects of seed biology such as dormancy, germination and mortality. In Arabidopsis, the inner integument displays one or two sub-epidermal cell layers that originate from periclinal cell divisions of the innermost epidermal cell layer. By contrast, the outer integument was considered to be two-cell layered. Here, we show that sub-epidermal chalazal cells grow in between the epidermal outer integument cell layers to create an incomplete three-cell layered outer integument. We found that the MADS box transcription factor TRANSPARENT TESTA 16 represses growth of the chalaza and formation of sub-epidermal outer integument cells. Finally, we demonstrate that sub-epidermal cells of the outer and inner integument respond differently to the repressive mechanism mediated by FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED Polycomb group proteins and to fertilization signals. Our data suggest that integument cell origin rather than sub-epidermal cell position underlies different responses to fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2769942785,"Medical researchers are increasingly interested in knowing how the complex community of micro-organisms living on human body impacts human health. Key to this is to understand how the microbes interact with each other. Time-course studies on human microbiome indicate that the composition of microbiome changes over short time periods, primarily as a consequence of synergistic and antagonistic interactions of the members of the microbiome with each other and with the environment. Knowledge of the abundance of bacteria-which are the predominant members of the human microbiome-in such time-course studies along with appropriate mathematical models will allow us to identify key dynamic interaction networks within the microbiome. However, the high-dimensional nature of these data poses significant challenges to the development of such mathematical models. We propose a high-dimensional linear State Space Model (SSM) with a new Expectation-Regularization-Maximization (ERM) algorithm to construct a dynamic Microbial Interaction Network (MIN). System noise and measurement noise can be separately specified through SSMs. In order to deal with the problem of high-dimensional parameter space in the SSMs, the proposed new ERM algorithm employs the idea of the adaptive LASSO-based variable selection method so that the sparsity property of MINs can be preserved. We performed simulation studies to evaluate the proposed ERM algorithm for variable selection. The proposed method is applied to identify the dynamic MIN from a time-course vaginal microbiome study of women. This method is amenable to future developments, which may include interactions between microbes and the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2770176699,"Sarcomas are rare, heterogeneous tumors for which prognosis remains dismal in patients with advanced disease. Pazopanib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, has shown modest efficacy in patients with soft tissue sarcoma who fail cytotoxic chemotherapy. The cytotoxic agent temozolomide has also demonstrated activity in patients with advanced sarcoma.We performed a retrospective case series to evaluate the feasibility of adding temozolomide to pazopanib in advanced sarcoma patients following single-agent pazopanib failure.Patients with recurrent, metastatic sarcomas who had progressed on single-agent pazopanib and continued on pazopanib with the addition of temozolomide were included in this retrospective analysis to examine the tolerability and responses associated with the treatment combination.Nine patients with a range of sarcoma subtypes were identified (55% female; median age, 48 years; median number of therapies prior to pazopanib, 3). All patients received combination therapy. One patient was recently started on therapy and was excluded from the analysis (n = 8 evaluable patients). Median PFS for single-agent pazopanib was 7.5 months (range 2-19). For the eight evaluable patients (63% female), best response at 4 months with pazopanib plus temozolomide was partial response (n = 1), stable disease (n = 3) and progressive disease (n = 4), with a median PFS of 3.5 months (range 0-15). Median PFS with combination treatment in patients with stable disease or response was 8 months (range 5-15). All four patients who achieved clinical benefit remain on therapy and are tolerating the combination therapy with expected but manageable side effects.In heavily pretreated patients with advanced sarcoma, the addition of temozolomide to pazopanib was found to be tolerable. Future prospective trials are required to deduce whether temozolomide extends the clinical benefit of pazopanib."
