https://openalex.org/W2054921843,"The Curiosity rover discovered fine-grained sedimentary rocks, which are inferred to represent an ancient lake and preserve evidence of an environment that would have been suited to support a martian biosphere founded on chemolithoautotrophy. This aqueous environment was characterized by neutral pH, low salinity, and variable redox states of both iron and sulfur species. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus were measured directly as key biogenic elements; by inference, phosphorus is assumed to have been available. The environment probably had a minimum duration of hundreds to tens of thousands of years. These results highlight the biological viability of fluvial-lacustrine environments in the post-Noachian history of Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2011543988,"Sedimentary rocks at Yellowknife Bay (Gale crater) on Mars include mudstone sampled by the Curiosity rover. The samples, John Klein and Cumberland, contain detrital basaltic minerals, calcium sulfates, iron oxide or hydroxides, iron sulfides, amorphous material, and trioctahedral smectites. The John Klein smectite has basal spacing of ~10 angstroms, indicating little interlayer hydration. The Cumberland smectite has basal spacing at both ~13.2 and ~10 angstroms. The larger spacing suggests a partially chloritized interlayer or interlayer magnesium or calcium facilitating H 2 O retention. Basaltic minerals in the mudstone are similar to those in nearby eolian deposits. However, the mudstone has far less Fe-forsterite, possibly lost with formation of smectite plus magnetite. Late Noachian/Early Hesperian or younger age indicates that clay mineral formation on Mars extended beyond Noachian time."

We report and discuss measurements of the absorbed dose and dose equivalent from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles on the martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum. These measurements provide insight into the radiation hazards associated with a human mission to the surface of Mars and provide an anchor point with which to model the subsurface radiation environment, with implications for microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, as well as for the preservation of potential organic biosignatures of the ancient martian environment."
https://openalex.org/W2049603496,"Management of marine ecosystems requires spatial information on current impacts. In several marine regions, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea, legal mandates and agreements to implement ecosystem-based management and spatial plans provide new opportunities to balance uses and protection of marine ecosystems. Analyses of the intensity and distribution of cumulative impacts of human activities directly connected to the ecological goals of these policy efforts are critically needed. Quantification and mapping of the cumulative impact of 22 drivers to 17 marine ecosystems reveals that 20% of the entire basin and 60–99% of the territorial waters of EU member states are heavily impacted, with high human impact occurring in all ecoregions and territorial waters. Less than 1% of these regions are relatively unaffected. This high impact results from multiple drivers, rather than one individual use or stressor, with climatic drivers (increasing temperature and UV, and acidification), demersal fishing, ship traffic, and, in coastal areas, pollution from land accounting for a majority of cumulative impacts. These results show that coordinated management of key areas and activities could significantly improve the condition of these marine ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2042434711,"H2O, CO2, SO2, O2, H2, H2S, HCl, chlorinated hydrocarbons, NO, and other trace gases were evolved during pyrolysis of two mudstone samples acquired by the Curiosity rover at Yellowknife Bay within Gale crater, Mars. H2O/OH-bearing phases included 2:1 phyllosilicate(s), bassanite, akaganeite, and amorphous materials. Thermal decomposition of carbonates and combustion of organic materials are candidate sources for the CO2. Concurrent evolution of O2 and chlorinated hydrocarbons suggests the presence of oxychlorine phase(s). Sulfides are likely sources for sulfur-bearing species. Higher abundances of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the mudstone compared with Rocknest windblown materials previously analyzed by Curiosity suggest that indigenous martian or meteoritic organic carbon sources may be preserved in the mudstone; however, the carbon source for the chlorinated hydrocarbons is not definitively of martian origin."
https://openalex.org/W1993747047,"Lignocellulosic biomass is a renewable resource that significantly can substitute fossil resources for the production of fuels, chemicals, and materials. Efficient saccharification of this biomass to fermentable sugars will be a key technology in future biorefineries. Traditionally, saccharification was thought to be accomplished by mixtures of hydrolytic enzymes. However, recently it has been shown that lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) contribute to this process by catalyzing oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides utilizing a mechanism involving molecular oxygen and an electron donor. These enzymes thus represent novel tools for the saccharification of plant biomass. Most characterized LPMOs, including all reported bacterial LPMOs, form aldonic acids, i.e., products oxidized in the C1 position of the terminal sugar. Oxidation at other positions has been observed, and there has been some debate concerning the nature of this position (C4 or C6). In this study, we have characterized an LPMO from Neurospora crassa (NcLPMO9C; also known as NCU02916 and NcGH61–3). Remarkably, and in contrast to all previously characterized LPMOs, which are active only on polysaccharides, NcLPMO9C is able to cleave soluble cello-oligosaccharides as short as a tetramer, a property that allowed detailed product analysis. Using mass spectrometry and NMR, we show that the cello-oligosaccharide products released by this enzyme contain a C4 gemdiol/keto group at the nonreducing end.

https://openalex.org/W2112430193,"Sedimentary rocks examined by the Curiosity rover at Yellowknife Bay, Mars, were derived from sources that evolved from an approximately average martian crustal composition to one influenced by alkaline basalts. No evidence of chemical weathering is preserved, indicating arid, possibly cold, paleoclimates and rapid erosion and deposition. The absence of predicted geochemical variations indicates that magnetite and phyllosilicates formed by diagenesis under low-temperature, circumneutral pH, rock-dominated aqueous conditions. Analyses of diagenetic features (including concretions, raised ridges, and fractures) at high spatial resolution indicate that they are composed of iron- and halogen-rich components, magnesium-iron-chlorine–rich components, and hydrated calcium sulfates, respectively. Composition of a cross-cutting dike-like feature is consistent with sedimentary intrusion. The geochemistry of these sedimentary rocks provides further evidence for diverse depositional and diagenetic sedimentary environments during the early history of Mars."
https://openalex.org/W2014589403,"We determined radiogenic and cosmogenic noble gases in a mudstone on the floor of Gale Crater. A K-Ar age of 4.21 ± 0.35 billion years represents a mixture of detrital and authigenic components and confirms the expected antiquity of rocks comprising the crater rim. Cosmic-ray-produced (3)He, (21)Ne, and (36)Ar yield concordant surface exposure ages of 78 ± 30 million years. Surface exposure occurred mainly in the present geomorphic setting rather than during primary erosion and transport. Our observations are consistent with mudstone deposition shortly after the Gale impact or possibly in a later event of rapid erosion and deposition. The mudstone remained buried until recent exposure by wind-driven scarp retreat. Sedimentary rocks exposed by this mechanism may thus offer the best potential for organic biomarker preservation against destruction by cosmic radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2069283089,"Background Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is now the fastest spreading tropical disease globally. Previous studies indicate that climate and human behavior interact to influence dengue virus and vector (Aedes aegypti) population dynamics; however, the relative effects of these variables depends on local ecology and social context. We investigated the roles of climate and socio-ecological factors on Ae. aegypti population dynamics in Machala, a city in southern coastal Ecuador where dengue is hyper-endemic. Methods/Principal findings We studied two proximate urban localities where we monitored weekly Ae. aegypti oviposition activity (Nov. 2010-June 2011), conducted seasonal pupal surveys, and surveyed household to identify dengue risk factors. The results of this study provide evidence that Ae. aegypti population dynamics are influenced by social risk factors that vary by season and lagged climate variables that vary by locality. Best-fit models to predict the presence of Ae. aegypti pupae included parameters for household water storage practices, access to piped water, the number of households per property, condition of the house and patio, and knowledge and perceptions of dengue. Rainfall and minimum temperature were significant predictors of oviposition activity, although the effect of rainfall varied by locality due to differences in types of water storage containers. Conclusions These results indicate the potential to reduce the burden of dengue in this region by conducting focused vector control interventions that target high-risk households and containers in each season and by developing predictive models using climate and non-climate information. These findings provide the region's public health sector with key information for conducting time and location-specific vector control campaigns, and highlight the importance of local socio-ecological studies to understand dengue dynamics.

However, the pathology of HD is characterized by early and dramatic destruction selectively of the striatum. We previously reported that the striatal-specific protein Rhes binds mHtt and enhances its cytotoxicity. Moreover, Rhes-deleted mice are dramatically protected from neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction in mouse models of HD. We now report a function of Rhes in autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway implicated in aging and HD neurodegeneration. In PC12 cells, deletion of endogenous Rhes decreases autophagy, whereas Rhes overexpression activates autophagy. These effects are independent of mTOR and opposite in the direction predicted by the known activation of mTOR by Rhes. Rhes robustly binds the autophagy regulator Beclin-1, decreasing its inhibitory interaction with Bcl-2 independent of JNK-1 signaling. Finally, co-expression of mHtt blocks Rhes-induced autophagy activation. Thus, the isolated pathology and delayed onset of HD may reflect the striatal-selective expression and changes in autophagic activity of Rhes.

Huntington disease (HD) 4The abbreviations used are: HDHuntington diseasemHttmutant huntingtinwtHttwild-type huntingtinmTORmammalian target of rapamycin. is an autosomal dominant lethal neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of glutamine residues in the protein huntingtin (1The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupA novel gene containing a trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on Huntington's disease chromosomes.Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7052) Google Scholar). HD is characterized by selective and profound destruction of the corpus striatum, a brain region important in movement, emotion, and higher brain function. Thus, the cardinal symptoms of HD include a choreiform movement disorder, together with psychiatric and cognitive dysfunction (2Ross C.A. Tabrizi S.J. Huntington's disease: from molecular pathogenesis to clinical treatment.Lancet Neurol. 2011; 10: 83-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Despite the regional selectivity of HD, huntingtin (wtHtt) and mutant huntingtin (mHtt) are expressed uniformly throughout the brain and many body tissues (3Li S.H. Schilling G. Young 3rd, W.S.

The distinct pathology of HD may reflect the interaction between mHtt and the striatal-selective G-protein Rhes (4Subramaniam S. Sixt K.M. Barrow R. Snyder S.H.

Snyder S.H. Rhes is a striatal-enriched protein with pathophysiologic relevance.Eur. J. Neurodegen. Dis. 2012; 1: 89-100Google Scholar). Rhes binds mHtt and acts as a SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier) E3 ligase to stimulate sumoylation of mHtt, a post-translation modification known to augment mHtt toxicity (4Subramaniam S.

SUMO modification of Huntingtin and Huntington's disease pathology.Science. 2004; 304: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Rhes also physiologically regulates sumoylation and enhances a process we have termed “cross-sumoylation” (7Subramaniam S. Mealer R.G. Sixt K.M. Barrow R.K. Usiello A. Snyder S.H.

Independent work by other groups have confirmed the importance of Rhes in mHtt cytotoxicty using primary neuron and stem cell models of HD (8Seredenina T. Gokce O. Luthi-Carter R.

We found that deletion of Rhes dramatically reduces striatal degeneration and motor dysfunction in a toxin model of HD (10Mealer R.G. Subramaniam S. Snyder S.H.

Rhes-deleted mice also have delayed onset of symptomatology in a genetic model of HD (11Baiamonte B.A. Lee F.A. Brewer S.T. Spano D. LaHoste G.J.

Huntington disease mutant huntingtin wild-type huntingtin mammalian target of rapamycin. The restricted expression pattern of Rhes explains the striatal-selective pathology of HD but not the delay in symptom onset, which typically occurs in late adult life. Conceivably, delayed onset is linked to macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy), a lysosomal degradation pathway implicated in aging and neurodegeneration (12Banerjee R. Beal M.F. Thomas B.

Multiple findings further illustrate the importance of autophagy in HD, including diminished loading of autophagic vesicles (19Martinez-Vicente M. Talloczy Z. Wong E. Tang G. Koga H. Kaushik S. de Vries R. Arias E. Harris S. Sulzer D. Cuervo A.M. Cargo recognition failure is responsible for inefficient autophagy in Huntington's disease.Nat.

Autophagosome-like vacuole formation in Huntington's disease lymphoblasts.Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and polyglutamine-dependent changes in neuronal autophagy (21Zheng S. Clabough E.B. Sarkar S. Futter M. Rubinsztein D.C. Zeitlin S.O. Deletion of the huntingtin polyglutamine stretch enhances neuronal autophagy and longevity in mice.PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1000838Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Regulation of autophagy is a complex process, integrating signals from many different pathways (22Yang Z. Klionsky D.J. Mammalian autophagy: core molecular machinery and signaling regulation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). One important regulator of autophagy is mTOR, whose activation classically inhibits autophagy (23Zoncu R. Efeyan A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR: from growth signal integration to cancer, diabetes and ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). We recently discovered that Rhes shares with Rheb the ability to bind and activate mTOR (24Subramaniam S. Napolitano F. Mealer R.G. Kim S. Errico F. Barrow R. Shahani N. Tyagi R. Snyder S.H. Usiello A. Rhes, a striatal-enriched small G protein, mediates mTOR signaling and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 15: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Additionally, Rhes-deleted mice have markedly reduced l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, a side effect of chronic l-DOPA (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) treatment caused by aberrant mTOR signaling in the striatum (24Subramaniam S. Napolitano F. Mealer R.G. Kim S. Errico F. Barrow R. Shahani N. Tyagi R. Snyder S.H. Usiello A. Rhes, a striatal-enriched small G protein, mediates mTOR signaling and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.Nat.

Inhibition of mTOR signaling in Parkinson's disease prevents L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra36Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Thus, Rhes plays a physiologic role in striatal mTOR activation and would be predicted to inhibit autophagy secondary to mTOR activation. A direct link between mHtt and mTOR has also been demonstrated, as Rubinsztein and co-workers (26Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G. Scaravilli F. Easton D.F. Duden R. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C. Inhibition of mTOR induces autophagy and reduces toxicity of polyglutamine expansions in fly and mouse models of Huntington disease.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar) showed that mHtt aggregates sequester mTOR, leading to decreased mTOR kinase activity and enhanced autophagy. In this study, we have explored influences of Rhes on autophagy to evaluate its significance in HD pathophysiology. Unless otherwise noted, reagents were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies for phospo-S6K (Thr-389), phospho-S6 (Ser-235/236), Beclin-1, LC3B, DARPP-32, and Myc-HRP were from Cell Signaling Technology; antibodies for LC3, GST, and FLAG were from Sigma; GAPDH antibody was from CalBiochem; Myc-M2 antibody was from Roche Applied Science; tubulin antibody was from Millipore. ER-Red (glibenclamide BODIPY-TR) and Golgi red (BODIPY-TR ceramide) were from Invitrogen and used as directed by the manufacturer. Plasmids for GST-Rhes, Myc-Rhes, and FLAG-Htt (N171)-18Q/82Q were described previously (4Subramaniam S. Sixt K.M. Barrow R. Snyder S.H. Rhes, a striatal specific protein, mediates mutant-huntingtin cytotoxicity.Science. 2009; 324: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). AsRed-Beclin-1 was a gift from Dr. Zhenyu Yue at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. FLAG-Beclin-1 and Myc-Bcl-2 were gifts from Dr. Beth Levine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. GFP-Rhes was cloned into pEGFP-C1, with GFP fused to the N terminus of Rhes. FLAG-Beclin-1, Myc-Bcl-2, and Beclin-1 domain constructs were purchased from Addgene and described previously (27Sun Q. Fan W. Chen K. Ding X. Chen S. Zhong Q. Identification of Barkor as a mammalian autophagy-specific factor for Beclin 1 and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19211-19216Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Beclin-1 151–451 was generated using PCR. PC12 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated plates and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 on two separate days with either scrambled siRNA (Sigma 4390849) or siRNA specific for Rhes (siRNA-1, Sigma s139719, and siRNA-2, Sigma s139720). GAPDH siRNA (Sigma 4390849) was used as a positive control to determine siRNA transfection efficacy. Forty-eight hours after the second transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for changes in Rhes RNA expression with rat primers (forward, TGTTCCCAGCCCAGAGCCATGA; reverse, GCGCATGGCAGGGAACGGAT) using the SYBR Green PCR-CT system from Applied Biosystems. Actin and GAPDH RNA were measured as positive controls. Protein production was performed as described previously (7Subramaniam S. Mealer R.G. Sixt K.M. Barrow R.K. Usiello A. Snyder S.H. Rhes, a physiologic regulator of sumoylation, enhances cross-sumoylation between the basic sumoylation enzymes E1 and Ubc9.J. Biol.

Striatal lysates from wild-type mice were homogenized in Tris IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) plus protease inhibitors. Lysate (0.1 mg) was incubated with 5 μg of purified GST or GST-Rhes and 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (a total 0.5-ml reaction volume) at 4 °C overnight, followed by washing three times in Tris IP buffer and eluted with 30 μl of 2× LDS buffer (Invitrogen). FLAG and Myc immunoprecipitations were performed with a similar protocol using EZ View-Red affinity gel (Sigma). For Beclin-1/Bcl-2 binding, a primary Myc-HRP from Roche Applied Science was used to avoid cross-reactivity with immunoprecipitating beads. HEK293 and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM + 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine, and were transfected with polyfect reagent (Qiagen). PC12 cells were grown in DMEM + 10% horse serum, 5% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine, and were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed in Tris IP buffer (described above) and analyzed by Western blot on 4–12% SDS NuPage gels (Invitrogen) for most experiments or 12% SDS NuPage gels to resolve LC3-I from LC3-II. Starvation medium was Earle's balanced salt solution plus Ca2+ and Mg2+. Rapamycin was employed at 0.2 mm diluted in DMSO, and chloroquine added at 50 μm. Autophagic flux was calculated as the amount of LC3-II in the presence of chloroquine minus the amount of LC3-II in the absence of chloroquine. Quantification was performed using fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies and the LiCOR Odyssey Imaging system, which is fully quantitative, and allows analysis to be performed between samples after normalization to the amount of GAPDH loading control per sample. This eliminates potential error using semi-quantitative chemiluminescent techniques and the requirement to analyze LC3-II levels from the same blot. The value obtained for autophagic flux represents the amount of autophagic membrane, or autophagosomes, delivered to lysosomes during the treatment time with chloroquine (28Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). GFP-LC3 puncta analysis was performed using HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 and were a gift from Dr. Beth Levine. Cells were transfected using polyfect with either Myc-Rhes or Myc-empty vector in normal DMEM +10% FBS. After 24 h, cells were transferred to low-autophagy medium (Opti-MEM + 5% FBS + 50 μg/ml G418). After an additional 24 h, cells were treated with or without 50 μm chloroquine for 2 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunofluorescence for Myc was performed using standard protocols. Cells were imaged as Z-section stacks with a 40× objective on a Leica SP8 MP confocal microscope, and the average number of GFP-LC3 puncta per cell were analyzed using the Puncta Analyzer plug-in for Image J2, written by Barry Wark. GFP-LC3 flux is the number of GFP-LC3 puncta after 2 h in the presence of chloroquine minus the number of GFP-LC3 puncta in the absence of chloroquine, normalized to control Myc-transfected cells (28Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test with results being considered significant if p < 0.05. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated a minimum of two times. PC12 cells display multiple neuronal attributes and are one of the few cell lines that express endogenous Rhes (29Vargiu P. De Abajo R. Garcia-Ranea J.A. Valencia A. Santisteban P. Crespo P. Bernal J. The small GTP-binding protein, Rhes, regulates signal transduction from G protein-coupled receptors.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We employed siRNA to deplete Rhes in PC12 cells. Following optimization, this procedure reduces Rhes RNA levels by ∼45% (Fig. 1A), comparable with a validated GAPDH siRNA (Fig. 1B), illustrating that our ability to reduce mRNA expression is limited by the transfection efficiency of PC12 cells, which is ∼60% using GFP (data not shown). As Rhes siRNA-1 showed the greatest reduction in Rhes RNA, it was used in subsequent studies. Treatment with Rhes siRNA-1 is associated with a 40% decline of S6K phosphorylation, corroborating our earlier findings that Rhes is a major determinant of mTOR signaling (Fig. 1C). Activation of mTOR is known to inhibit autophagy (23Zoncu R. Efeyan A. Sabatini D.M. mTOR: from growth signal integration to cancer, diabetes and ageing.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar). Autophagic flux is commonly measured by the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (distinguished by molecular weight on Western blot) in the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (28Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). Using a fluorescent secondary antibody to LC3-II and the fully quantitative LiCOR imaging system, we analyzed LC3-II levels normalized to total protein in control and Rhes-depleted cells. Surprisingly, Rhes depletion elicits a 40% decrease in autophagic flux following 90 min of chloroquine treatment, despite decreased mTOR signaling (Fig. 1C). We next explored the influence of exogenous Rhes in PC12 cells (Fig. 1D). Rhes overexpression elicits a 50% increase in phospho-S6K as well as a 60% increase in autophagic flux, measured after 90 min of chloroquine treatment. This observation, coupled with the decline in autophagy following Rhes depletion, implies that Rhes stimulates both autophagy and mTOR signaling. As mTOR kinase activity normally inhibits autophagy, the regulation of autophagy by Rhes in these cells appears to be independent of mTOR. To confirm that Rhes activates autophagic flux, HeLa cells that stably express GFP-LC3 were transfected with Rhes or control vector (Fig. 2A). The number of GFP-LC3 puncta generated during treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine indicates the number of autophagosomes generated during that time, or the autophagic flux (28Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Methods in mammalian autophagy research.Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). Compared with controls, no difference was observed in the average number of GFP-LC3 puncta per cell under basal conditions in Rhes-transfected cells. However, after 2 h of treatment with chloroquine, cells expressing Rhes had an increase of 50 GFP-LC3 puncta per cell, significantly different from an increase of only 30 GFP-LC3 puncta in control cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). This represents an increase in GFP-LC3 autophagic flux by 170% in cells transfected with Rhes compared with controls (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). Rapamycin is a potent inhibitor of mTOR and known inducer of autophagy. Overexpression of Rhes in HEK293 cells increases LC3-II levels in the presence and absence of chloroquine (comparing lane 1 versus 2, and lane 3 versus 4), again consistent with increased autophagic flux (Fig. 2D). The increase in LC3-II persists in the presence of rapamycin (lane 5 versus 6), supporting independence from mTOR signaling. There is no obvious difference in LC3-II levels in Rhes-expressing cells treated with both chloroquine and rapamycin (lane 7 versus 8), possibly because the cells have saturated their ability to generate LC3-II under such conditions. We previously demonstrated that Rhes binds mHtt protein to enhance its cytotoxicity (4Subramaniam S. Sixt K.M. Barrow R. Snyder S.H. Rhes, a striatal specific protein, mediates mutant-huntingtin cytotoxicity.Science. 2009; 324: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the interaction between Rhes and mHtt affects autophagy activation, we overexpressed Rhes in HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of huntingtin protein. Overexpressing mHtt, as well as wild-type Htt, abolishes the increase in LC3-II elicited by Rhes (Fig. 2, E and F). Expression of wtHtt alone or mHtt alone has no effect on the level of LC3-II. We next sought to determine whether Rhes is capable of binding proteins other than mTOR that affect autophagy. In striatal lysates, bacterially purified GST-Rhes binds avidly to endogenous Beclin-1, a protein critical for the induction of autophagy (Fig. 3A). Rhes does not interact with the autophagic protein LC3 or DARPP-32, a striatal-enriched protein involved in dopamine signaling. When co-expressed in HEK293 cells, Rhes robustly binds Beclin-1 but fails to interact with Bcl-2 or Vps34, other proteins of the Beclin-1 signaling complex, demonstrating the specificity of the Rhes/Beclin-1 interaction (Fig. 3B). A physiologic association of Rhes with Beclin-1 is supported by the co-localization of overexpressed Rhes and Beclin-1 in HeLa cells with both fluorescent protein tags (Fig. 4A) and small epitope tags (Fig. 4B). Using live-cell dyes specific for the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4C) and trans-Golgi network (Fig. 3D), GFP-tagged Rhes colocalizes with these perinuclear structures, consistent with the known localization of Beclin-1 (30Sinha S. Levine B. The autophagy effector Beclin 1: a novel BH3-only protein.Oncogene. 2008; 27: S137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Specific domains of Beclin-1 mediate its interaction with various proteins in the coordination of autophagy (31Kang R. Zeh H.J. Lotze M.T. Tang D. The Beclin 1 network regulates autophagy and apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Activated Beclin-1 binds Vps34 through both its central coiled-coil domain and C-terminal evolutionarily conserved domain to form a complex critical for autophagy. Binding of the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 to the BH3 domain in the N terminus of Beclin-1 inhibits autophagy activation, whereas decreasing the interaction between Beclin-1/Bcl-2 activates autophagy (32Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins inhibit Beclin 1-dependent autophagy.Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). We mapped the interaction of Rhes to the N-terminal 150 amino acids of Beclin-1, as a fragment with only amino acids 1–150 binds Rhes, whereas a fragment lacking this region fails to bind (Fig. 4C). The unique C terminus of Rhes, not present in other Ras-like proteins except the closest relative of Rhes, DexRas1 (in which it is only 50% homologous), appears to mediate the binding with Beclin-1 (Fig. 4D). A fragment containing only the C-terminal 95 amino acids of Rhes binds as well as full-length Rhes to the N terminus of Beclin-1. As both Rhes and Bcl-2 bind the N-terminal region of Beclin-1, we explored the influence of Rhes on the interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2. Starvation stimulates autophagy by increasing JNK-1-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2, preventing the inhibitory binding of Bcl-2 to Beclin-1 (32Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins inhibit Beclin 1-dependent autophagy.Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 33Wei Y. Pattingre S. Sinha S. Bassik M. Levine B. JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 regulates starvation-induced autophagy.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 678-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when Beclin-1 is free from Bcl-2, it can stimulate autophagy. Overexpression of Rhes substantially decreases Beclin-1/Bcl-2 binding, comparable with the reduction of Beclin-1/Bcl-2 binding caused by starvation (Fig. 5A). To confirm that Rhes exerts its autophagy activating effects through binding of Beclin-1 and not through changes in JNK-1 mediated signaling, we expressed a mutant of Bcl-2 (AAA) that cannot be phosphorylated by JNK-1 (33Wei Y. Pattingre S. Sinha S. Bassik M. Levine B. JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 regulates starvation-induced autophagy.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 678-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Thus, if Rhes simply affected upstream JNK-1 signaling it would have no effect on the interaction of Beclin-1 with the phospho-null mutant of Bcl-2 (AAA). Rhes decreases the interaction of Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 AAA to an equivalent extent as wild-type Bcl-2 (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, a Rhes mutant lacking the C-terminal region of Rhes (ΔC) that fails to bind Beclin-1 does not interrupt Beclin-1/Bcl-2 binding (Fig. 5C). However, residue Phe-123 in the BH3 domain of Beclin-1, which although required for Bcl-2 interaction, is not required for Rhes binding, suggesting that although Rhes and Bcl-2 bind the same general region of Beclin-1, they require different amino acids (data not shown). These findings suggest that Rhes competitively displaces Bcl-2 from Beclin-1 to activate autophagy independent of JNK-1 and mTOR signaling. Although mHtt is present throughout the body, the expression pattern of Rhes mirrors the known pathology of HD. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that Rhes directly interacts with mHtt and enhances cytotoxicity through increased sumoylation of mHtt, providing a potential explanation for the striatal selectivity of HD (4Subramaniam S. Sixt K.M. Barrow R. Snyder S.H. Rhes, a striatal specific protein, mediates mutant-huntingtin cytotoxicity.Science. 2009; 324: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, both Rhes and mHtt are expressed within the striatum for years, long before neuronal dysfunction and degeneration is evident. In the present study, we demonstrate that Rhes activates autophagy, which may explain the delay of symptom onset in HD, which is linked to autophagy. In cells with robust autophagy, overexpression of Rhes results in marked autophagic activation, whereas depletion of endogenous Rhes leads to diminished autophagic activation. The mechanism for autophagic enhancement reflects Rhes' sequestration of Beclin-1 from the inhibitory binding of Bcl-2. This effect seems to be prevented by the expression of huntingtin protein, possibly related to its own binding of Rhes. Competitive inhibition of Beclin-1/Bcl-2 binding occurs with many other important regulators of autophagy, including HMGB1, UVRAG, and Atg14L/Barkor (31Kang R. Zeh H.J. Lotze M.T. Tang D. The Beclin 1 network regulates autophagy and apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Rhes-induced autophagy is independent of mTOR, as the effect is not inhibited by rapamycin and occurs in the opposite direction as what would be predicted based our previous finding that Rhes activates mTOR (24Subramaniam S. Napolitano F. Mealer R.G. Kim S. Errico F. Barrow R. Shahani N. Tyagi R. Snyder S.H. Usiello A. Rhes, a striatal-enriched small G protein, mediates mTOR signaling and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.Nat.

White M.A. RalB and the exocyst mediate the cellular starvation response by direct activation of autophagosome assembly.Cell. 2011; 144: 253-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, Rhes can affect autophagy through two independent pathways (Fig. 5D). Other small G-proteins also impact autophagy with similar effects. For instance, RalB activates starvation-induced autophagy independent of mTOR but requires Beclin-1 (34Bodemann B.O. Orvedahl A. Cheng T. Ram R.R. Ou Y.H. Formstecher E. Maiti M. Hazelett C.C. Wauson E.M. Balakireva M. Camonis J.H. Yeaman C. Levine B.

Ras induces autophagy and can do so despite activated mTOR (35Guo J.Y. Chen H.Y. Mathew R. Fan J. Strohecker A.M. Karsli-Uzunbas G. Kamphorst J.J. Chen G. Lemons J.M. Karantza V. Coller H.A.

Cell. 2011; 42: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The relationship between mTOR and autophagy in the clearance of mHtt is complex. mTOR inhibition by drugs such as rapamycin, which induce autophagy, are clearly beneficial in HD models (17Harris H. Rubinsztein D.C. Control of autophagy as a therapy for neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2012; 8: 108-117Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, the clearance of mHtt by autophagy can occur in the presence of elevated mTOR but depends on Beclin-1 (37Yamamoto A. Cremona M.L. Rothman J.E. Autophagy-mediated clearance of huntingtin aggregates triggered by the insulin-signaling pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 719-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and separate studies demonstrate that mHtt accumulation is regulated by Beclin-1 (38Shibata M. Lu T. Furuya T. Degterev A. Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. MacDonald M. Yankner B. Yuan J. Regulation of intracellular accumulation of mutant Huntingtin by Beclin 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14474-14485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mHtt aggregates sequester mTOR, leading to decreased kinase activity and autophagy activation, presumably as a compensatory mechanism to cope with mHtt toxicity (26Ravikumar B. Vacher C. Berger Z. Davies J.E. Luo S. Oroz L.G. Scaravilli F. Easton D.F. Duden R. O'Kane C.J. Rubinsztein D.C. Inhibition of mTOR induces autophagy and reduces toxicity of polyglutamine expansions in fly and mouse models of Huntington disease.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar). A compensatory mechanism has been proposed to exist for Rhes; a meta-analysis of striatal gene expression found that Rhes is consistently down-regulated in HD and replacing Rhes expression augments toxicity (8Seredenina T. Gokce O. Luthi-Carter R. Decreased striatal RGS2 expression is neuroprotective in Huntington's disease (HD) and exemplifies a compensatory aspect of HD-induced gene regulation.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e22231Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rhes has also been implicated in other signaling pathways that may impact autophagy aside from mTOR. For example, recent studies have shown that Rhes can affect AKT signaling (39Harrison L.M. Muller S.H. Spano D. Effects of the Ras homolog Rhes on Akt/protein kinase B and glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation in striatum.Neuroscience. 2013; 236: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 40Bang S. Steenstra C. Kim S.F. Striatum specific protein, Rhes regulates AKT pathway.Neurosci. Lett. 2012; 521: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rhes can also interact with PAP7/ACBD3 to regulate iron homeostasis as well as enhance mHtt toxicity (41Sbodio J.I. Paul B.D. Machamer C.E. Snyder S.H. Golgi protein ACBD3 mediates neurotoxicity associated with Huntington's disease.Cell Rep. 2013; 4: 890-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 42Choi B.R. Bang S. Chen Y. Cheah J.H. Kim S.F. PKA modulates iron trafficking in the striatum via small GTPase, Rhes.Neuroscience. 2013; 253: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The gradual accumulation of mHtt insults and changes in the cellular processes that normally deal with such burdens are likely responsible for the delayed onset of HD. Early in life when autophagy is not required, proteosomal degradation is robust and capable of preventing cytotoxicity. With advancing age, proteasomal function becomes compromised, forcing cells to rely more heavily on the autophagic pathway (43Li X.J. Li S. Proteasomal dysfunction in aging and Huntington disease.Neurobiol. Dis. 2011; 43: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Autophagic capacity eventually decreases, which potentially leads to both normal aging and the pathologic aging seen in neurodegeneration (14Rubinsztein D.C. Mariño G. Kroemer G. Autophagy and aging.Cell. 2011; 146: 682-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in most tissues, the cytotoxic influences of mHtt are initially minimized by the proteasome before autophagy is required. By contrast, in the striatum, Rhes/mHtt interactions may augment cytotoxicity as well as diminish the autophagic capacity of the neuron, which eventually accounts for the striatal selectivity and delayed onset of HD, respectively. Although we find that wtHtt appears to decrease the increase in LC3-II elicited by Rhes comparable with mHtt, this is likely of little consequence; we have previously shown that Rhes does not enhance cytotoxicity or sumoylation in the presence of wtHtt despite being capable of interacting, albeit with lower affinity, when compared with mHtt (4Subramaniam S. Sixt K.M. Barrow R. Snyder S.H. Rhes, a striatal specific protein, mediates mutant-huntingtin cytotoxicity.Science. 2009; 324: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We suspect that huntingtin inhibits the Rhes-induced increase in LC3-II by preventing the interaction of Rhes with Beclin-1. In summary, Rhes displays multiple physiologic and pathophysiologic activities in the striatum. Rhes activates autophagy by competitively displacing the inhibitory binding of Bcl-2 to Beclin-1. Rhes enhances cross-sumoylation and regulates sumoylation in the striatum (7Subramaniam S. Mealer R.G. Sixt K.M. Barrow R.K. Usiello A. Snyder S.H. Rhes, a physiologic regulator of sumoylation, enhances cross-sumoylation between the basic sumoylation enzymes E1 and Ubc9.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 20428-20432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mice lacking Rhes have decreased l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, demonstrating that Rhes physiologically activates mTOR in the striatum (24Subramaniam S. Napolitano F. Mealer R.G. Kim S. Errico F. Barrow R. Shahani N. Tyagi R. Snyder S.H. Usiello A. Rhes, a striatal-enriched small G protein, mediates mTOR signaling and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 15: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that striatal shrinkage in HD stems from the sequestration of Rhes by mHtt, such that less is available to maintain trophic support through mTOR in the striatum (44Subramaniam S. Snyder S.H. Huntington's disease is a disorder of the corpus striatum: focus on Rhes (Ras homologue enriched in the striatum).Neuropharmacology. 2011; 60: 1187-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rhes binds mHtt and enhances cytotoxicity, suggesting that deletion of Rhes should diminish HD pathophysiology (4Subramaniam S. Sixt K.M. Barrow R. Snyder S.H. Rhes, a striatal specific protein, mediates mutant-huntingtin cytotoxicity.Science. 2009; 324: 1327-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by our recent findings that the selective striatal damage and motor dysfunction elicited by 3-nitropropionic acid, a well established and striatal-specific model of HD neurotoxicity, is profoundly reduced in Rhes-deleted mice (10Mealer R.G. Subramaniam S. Snyder S.H. Rhes deletion is neuroprotective in the 3-nitropropionic acid model of Huntington's disease.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 4206-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Rhes-deleted mice also have decreased motor dysfunction in the R6/1 genetic model of HD, supporting our hypothesis that Rhes is responsible for the striatal selectivity of HD (11Baiamonte B.A. Lee F.A. Brewer S.T. Spano D. LaHoste G.J. Attenuation of Rhes activity significantly delays the appearance of behavioral symptoms in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e53606Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, the regulation of autophagy by Rhes may account for the delayed onset of HD neuropathology."

These features have not been simultaneously achieved by previous workflows. We demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the workflow by translating the yeast consensus metabolic network into a kinetic model.

https://openalex.org/W2008113881,"Coral bleaching is a significant contributor to the worldwide degradation of coral reefs and is indicative of the termination of symbiosis between the coral host and its symbiotic algae (dinoflagellate; Symbiodinium sp. complex), usually by expulsion or xenophagy (symbiophagy) of its dinoflagellates. Herein, we provide evidence that during the earliest stages of environmentally induced bleaching, heat stress and light stress generate distinctly different pathomorphological changes in the chloroplasts, while a combined heat- and light-stress exposure induces both pathomorphologies; suggesting that these stressors act on the dinoflagellate by different mechanisms. Within the first 48 hours of a heat stress (32°C) under low-light conditions, heat stress induced decomposition of thylakoid structures before observation of extensive oxidative damage; thus it is the disorganization of the thylakoids that creates the conditions allowing photo-oxidative-stress. Conversely, during the first 48 hours of a light stress (2007 µmoles m−2 s−1 PAR) at 25°C, condensation or fusion of multiple thylakoid lamellae occurred coincidently with levels of oxidative damage products, implying that photo-oxidative stress causes the structural membrane damage within the chloroplasts. Exposure to combined heat- and light-stresses induced both pathomorphologies, confirming that these stressors acted on the dinoflagellate via different mechanisms. Within 72 hours of exposure to heat and/or light stresses, homeostatic processes (e.g., heat-shock protein and anti-oxidant enzyme response) were evident in the remaining intact dinoflagellates, regardless of the initiating stressor. Understanding the sequence of events during bleaching when triggered by different environmental stressors is important for predicting both severity and consequences of coral bleaching."
https://openalex.org/W1990889883,"Mitochondrial dynamics greatly influence the biogenesis and morphology of mitochondria. Mitochondria are particularly important in neurons, which have a high demand for energy. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction is strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Until now various post-translational modifications for mitochondrial dynamic proteins and several regulatory proteins have explained complex mitochondrial dynamics. However, the precise mechanism that coordinates these complex processes remains unclear. To further understand the regulatory machinery of mitochondrial dynamics, we screened a mitochondrial siRNA library and identified mortalin as a potential regulatory protein. Both genetic and chemical inhibition of mortalin strongly induced mitochondrial fragmentation and synergistically increased Aβ-mediated cytotoxicity as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly we determined that the expression of mortalin in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and in the triple transgenic-AD mouse model was considerably decreased. In contrast, overexpression of mortalin significantly suppressed Aβ-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. Taken together, our results suggest that down-regulation of mortalin may potentiate Aβ-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2148021628,"Mucin 2 (MUC2) is a mucin molecule aberrantly expressed by ovarian cancer cells. Previous in vitro studies have indicated that MUC2 promotes cancer growth and metastasis through a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-dependent mechanism. However, this mechanism has never been linked to clinical oncology, and its prognostic significance needed to be clarified. Here, we collected 102 consecutive ovarian cancer specimens and used the multiple immuno-histo-chemical/-fluorescent technique to determine the correlations between the MUC2 expression status, the ratio of M1/M2 TAMs and the densities of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)(+) TAMs and COX-2(+) cancer cells. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic influences of these parameters. As a result, we found that the MUC2 overexpression (immunostaining ++/+++) was significantly correlated with a reduced ratio of M1/M2 TAMs (p<0.001), an increased density of COX-2(+) TAMs (p<0.001) and an increased density of COX-2(+) cancer cells (p=0.017). Moreover, most of the M2 TAMs (93%-100%) and COX-2(+) TAMs (63%-89%) overlapped; and the COX-2(+) cancer cells were frequently observed near the COX-2(+) TAMs. In the Cox regression analysis, MUC2 overexpression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for ovarian cancer patients, of which the hazard ratio (HR) was 2.354 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.031-10.707, p=0.005). Also, the reduced ratio of M1/M2 TAMs and the increased densities of COX-2(+) TAMs and COX-2(+) cancer cells were demonstrated to be the predictors of poor prognosis, among which the reduced M1/M2 ratio possessed the highest HR (1.767, 95% CI: 1.061-6.957, p=0.019). All these findings revealed that MUC2 can concurrently exert M2-polarizing and COX-2-inducing effects on TAMs, by which it causes an imbalanced TAM M1-/M2-polarization pattern and induces local PGE2 synthesis (in both TAMs and cancer cells). The positive feedback between local PGE2 synthesis and TAM M2-polarization accelerates ovarian cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2071420454,"NF-κB is a key transcription factor that regulates innate immune response. Its activity is tightly controlled by numerous feedback loops, including two negative loops mediated by NF-κB inducible inhibitors, IκBα and A20, which assure oscillatory responses, and by positive feedback loops arising due to the paracrine and autocrine regulation via TNFα, IL-1 and other cytokines. We study the NF-κB system of interlinked negative and positive feedback loops, combining bifurcation analysis of the deterministic approximation with stochastic numerical modeling. Positive feedback assures the existence of limit cycle oscillations in unstimulated wild-type cells and introduces bistability in A20-deficient cells. We demonstrated that cells of significant autocrine potential, i.e., cells characterized by high secretion of TNFα and its receptor TNFR1, may exhibit sustained cytoplasmic–nuclear NF-κB oscillations which start spontaneously due to stochastic fluctuations. In A20-deficient cells even a small TNFα expression rate qualitatively influences system kinetics, leading to long-lasting NF-κB activation in response to a short-pulsed TNFα stimulation. As a consequence, cells with impaired A20 expression or increased TNFα secretion rate are expected to have elevated NF-κB activity even in the absence of stimulation. This may lead to chronic inflammation and promote cancer due to the persistent activation of antiapoptotic genes induced by NF-κB. There is growing evidence that A20 mutations correlate with several types of lymphomas and elevated TNFα secretion is characteristic of many cancers. Interestingly, A20 loss or dysfunction also leaves the organism vulnerable to septic shock and massive apoptosis triggered by the uncontrolled TNFα secretion, which at high levels overcomes the antiapoptotic action of NF-κB. It is thus tempting to speculate that some cancers of deregulated NF-κB signaling may be prone to the pathogen-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2103473238,"The transcription factor p53 regulates cellular integrity in response to stress. p53 is mutated in more than half of cancerous cells, with a majority of the mutations localized to the DNA binding domain (DBD). In order to map the structural and dynamical features of the DBD, we carried out multiple copy molecular dynamics simulations (totaling 0.8 μs). Simulations show the loop 1 to be the most dynamic element among the DNA-contacting loops (loops 1-3). Loop 1 occupies two major conformational states: extended and recessed; the former but not the latter displays correlations in atomic fluctuations with those of loop 2 (~24 Å apart). Since loop 1 binds to the major groove whereas loop 2 binds to the minor groove of DNA, our results begin to provide some insight into the possible mechanism underpinning the cooperative nature of DBD binding to DNA. We propose (1) a novel mechanism underlying the dynamics of loop 1 and the possible tread-milling of p53 on DNA and (2) possible mutations on loop 1 residues to restore the transcriptional activity of an oncogenic mutation at a distant site."

Samples were collected from 499 T. cruzi seropositive blood donors who had donated between 1996 and 2002, and 101 patients with clinically diagnosed Chagas cardiomyopathy. In 2008-2010, all subjects underwent a complete medical examination. After genotype calling, quality control filtering with exclusion of 20 cases, and imputation of 1,000 genomes variants; association analysis was performed for 7 cardiac and parasite related traits, adjusting for population stratification.The cohort showed a wide range of African, European, and modest Native American admixture proportions, consistent with the recent history of Brazil. No SNPs were found to be highly (P<10(-8)) associated with cardiomyopathy. The two mostly highly associated SNPs for cardiomyopathy (rs4149018 and rs12582717; P-values <10(-6)) are located on Chromosome 12p12.2 in the SLCO1B1 gene, a solute carrier family member. We identified 44 additional genic SNPs associated with six traits at P-value <10(-6): Ejection Fraction, PR, QRS, QT intervals, antibody levels by EIA, and parasitemia by PCR.This GWAS identified suggestive SNPs that may impact the risk of progression to cardiomyopathy. Although this Chagas cohort is the largest examined by GWAS to date, (580 subjects), moderate sample size may explain in part the limited number of significant SNP variants. Enlarging the current sample through expanded cohorts and meta-analyses, and targeted studies of candidate genes, will be required to confirm and extend the results reported here. Future studies should also include exposed seronegative controls to investigate genetic associations with susceptibility or resistance to T. cruzi infection and non-Chagas cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2129228555,"Rapid climate change represents one of the top threats to biodiversity, causing declines and extinctions of many species. Range shifts are a key response, but in many cases are incompatible with the current extent of protected areas. In this study we used ensemble species distribution models to identify range changes for 21 reptile and 16 amphibian species in Romania for the 2020s and 2050s time horizons under three emission scenarios (A1B = integrated world, rapid economic growth, A2A = divided world, rapid economic growth [realistic scenario], B2A = regional development, environmentally-friendly scenario) and no- and limited-dispersal assumptions. We then used irreplaceability analysis to test the efficacy of the Natura 2000 network to meet conservation targets. Under all scenarios and time horizons, 90% of the species suffered range contractions (greatest loses under scenarios B2A for 2020s, and A1B for 2050s), and four reptile species expanded their ranges. Two reptile and two amphibian species are predicted to completely lose climate space by 2050s. Currently, 35 species do not meet conservation targets (>40% representation in protected areas), but the target is predicted to be met for 4 - 14 species under future climate conditions, with higher representation under the limited-dispersal scenario. The Alpine and Steppic-Black Sea biogeographic regions have the highest irreplaceability value, and act as climate refugia for many reptiles and amphibians. The Natura 2000 network performs better for achieving herpetofauna conservation goals in the future, owing to the interaction between drastic range contractions, and range shifts towards existing protected areas. Thus, conservation actions for herpetofauna in Romania need to focus on: (1) building institutional capacity of protected areas in the Alpine and Steppic-Black Sea biogeographic regions, and (2) facilitating natural range shifts by improving the conservation status of herpetofauna outside protected areas, specifically in traditionally-managed landscapes and abandoned cropland."
https://openalex.org/W2021672343,"Background Initial evidence suggests that depressive symptoms are more frequent in patients with atrial fibrillation. Data from the general population are limited. Methods and Results In 10,000 individuals (mean age 56±11 years, 49.4% women) of the population-based Gutenberg Health Study we assessed depression by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and a history of depression in relation to manifest atrial fibrillation (n = 309 cases). The median (25th/75th percentile) PHQ-9 score of depressive symptoms was 4 (2/6) in atrial fibrillation individuals versus 3 (2/6) individuals without atrial fibrillation, . Multivariable regression analyses of the severity of depressive symptoms in relation to atrial fibrillation in cardiovascular risk factor adjusted models revealed a relation of PHQ-9 values and atrial fibrillation (odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.08; P = 0.023). The association was stronger for the somatic symptom dimension of depression (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.15; P = 0.0085) than for cognitive symptoms (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98–1.11; P = 0.15). Results did not change markedly after additional adjustment for heart failure, partnership status or the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein. Both, self-reported physical health status, very good/good versus fair/bad, (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41–0.70; P<0.001) and mental health status (OR 0.61 (0.46–0.82); P = 0.0012) were associated with atrial fibrillation in multivariable-adjusted models. Conclusions In a population-based sample we observed a higher burden of depressive symptoms driven by somatic symptom dimensions in individuals with atrial fibrillation. Depression was associated with a worse perception of physical or mental health status. Whether screening and treatment of depressive symptoms modulates disease progression and outcome needs to be shown."
https://openalex.org/W2035183320,"Background The small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén), is one of the major rice pests in Asia and has developed resistance to multiple classes of insecticides. Understanding resistance mechanisms is essential to the management of this pest. Biochemical and molecular assays were performed in this study to systematically characterize deltamethrin resistance mechanisms with laboratory-selected resistant and susceptible strains of SBPH. Methodology/Principal Findings Deltamethrin resistant strains of SBPH (JH-del) were derived from a field population by continuously selections (up to 30 generations) in the laboratory, while a susceptible strain (JHS) was obtained from the same population by removing insecticide pressure for 30 generations. The role of detoxification enzymes in the resistance was investigated using synergism and enzyme activity assays with strains of different resistant levels. Furthermore, 71 cytochrome P450, 93 esterases and 12 glutathione-S-transferases cDNAs were cloned based on transcriptome data of a field collected population. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR screening analysis of 176 identified detoxification genes demonstrated that multiple P450 and esterase genes were overexpressed (>2-fold) in JH-del strains (G4 and G30) when compared to that in JHS, and the results of quantitative PCR coincided with the semi-quantitative RT-PCR results. Target mutation at IIS3–IIS6 regions encoded by the voltage-gated sodium channel gene was ruled out for conferring the observed resistance. Conclusion/Significance As the first attempt to discover genes potentially involved in SBPH pyrethroid resistance, this study putatively identified several candidate genes of detoxification enzymes that were significantly overexpressed in the resistant strain, which matched the synergism and enzyme activity testing. The biochemical and molecular evidences suggest that the high level pyrethroid resistance in L. striatellus could be due to enhanced detoxification rather than target insensitivity. The findings lay a solid ground for further resistance mechanism elucidation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2045832353,"In insects, the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) coordinates major developmental transitions. While the first and the final steps of 20E biosynthesis are characterized, the pathway from 7-dehydrocholesterol to 5β-ketodiol, commonly referred as the “black box”, remains hypothetical and whether there are still unidentified enzymes is unknown. The black box would include some oxidative steps, which are believed to be mediated by P450 enzymes. To identify new enzyme(s) involved in steroid synthesis, we analyzed by small-scale microarray the expression of all the genes encoding P450 enzymes of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae in active steroidogenic organs of adults, ovaries from blood-fed females and male reproductive tracts, compared to inactive steroidogenic organs, ovaries from non-blood-fed females. Some genes encoding P450 enzymes were specifically overexpressed in female ovaries after a blood-meal or in male reproductive tracts but only three genes were found to be overexpressed in active steroidogenic organs of both females and males: cyp307a1, cyp4g16 and cyp6n1. Among these genes, only cyp307a1 has an expression pattern similar to other mosquito steroidogenic genes. Moreover, loss-of-function by transient RNAi targeting cyp307a1 disrupted ecdysteroid production demonstrating that this gene is required for ecdysteroid biosynthesis in Anopheles gambiae."
https://openalex.org/W2013075704,"Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) allele is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) due to the higher prevalence and earlier onset of AD in apoE4 carriers. Accumulating data suggest that the interaction between the N- and the C-terminal domains in the protein may be the main pathologic feature of apoE4. To test this hypothesis, we used Arg-61 mice, a model of apoE4 domain interaction, by introducing the domain interaction feature of human apoE4 into native mouse apoE. We carried out hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tests and related cellular and molecular assays on 12- and 3-month-old Arg-61 and age-matched background C57BL/6J mice. Learning and memory task performance were impaired in Arg-61 mice at both old and young ages compared with C57BL/6J mice. Surprisingly, young Arg-61 mice had more mitotic doublecortin-positive cells in the subgranular zone; mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB were also higher in 3-month-old Arg-61 hippocampus compared with C57BL/6J mice. These early-age neurotrophic and neurogenic (proliferative) effects in the Arg-61 mouse may be an inadequate compensatory but eventually detrimental attempt by the system to ""repair"" itself. This is supported by the higher cleaved caspase-3 levels in the young animals that not only persisted, but increased in old age, and the lower levels of doublecortin at old age in the hippocampus of Arg-61 mice. These results are consistent with human apoE4-dependent cognitive and neuro-pathologic changes, supporting the principal role of domain interaction in the pathologic effect of apoE4. Domain interaction is, therefore, a viable therapeutic/prophylactic target for cognitive impairment and AD in apoE4 subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2089417302,"Proteins can move from blood circulation into salivary glands through active transportation, passive diffusion or ultrafiltration, some of which are then released into saliva and hence can potentially serve as biomarkers for diseases if accurately identified. We present a novel computational method for predicting salivary proteins that come from circulation. The basis for the prediction is a set of physiochemical and sequence features we found to be discerning between human proteins known to be movable from circulation to saliva and proteins deemed to be not in saliva. A classifier was trained based on these features using a support-vector machine to predict protein secretion into saliva. The classifier achieved 88.56% average recall and 90.76% average precision in 10-fold cross-validation on the training data, indicating that the selected features are informative. Considering the possibility that our negative training data may not be highly reliable (i.e., proteins predicted to be not in saliva), we have also trained a ranking method, aiming to rank the known salivary proteins from circulation as the highest among the proteins in the general background, based on the same features. This prediction capability can be used to predict potential biomarker proteins for specific human diseases when coupled with the information of differentially expressed proteins in diseased versus healthy control tissues and a prediction capability for blood-secretory proteins. Using such integrated information, we predicted 31 candidate biomarker proteins in saliva for breast cancer."

Shrimp in the genus Alvinocaris associated with vestimentiferans from shallow (530 m) and deep (1400-2800 m) sites were used to test the hypothesis that seep animals derive a greater proportion of their nutrition from seeps (i.e. a lower proportion from the surface) at greater depths. To account for spatial variability in the inorganic source pool, we used the differences between the mean tissue δ(13)C and δ(15)N of the shrimp in each collection and the mean δ (13)C and δ(15)N values of the vestimentiferans from the same collection, since vestimentiferans are functionally autotrophic and serve as a baseline for environmental isotopic variation. There was a significant negative relationship between this difference and depth for both δ(13)C and δ(15)N (p=0.02 and 0.007, respectively), which supports the hypothesis of higher dependence on seep nutrition with depth. The small polychaete worm Protomystides sp. was hypothesized to be a blood parasite of the vestimentiferan Escarpialaminata. There was a highly significant linear relationship between the δ(13)C values of Protomystides sp. and the E. laminata individuals to which they were attached across all collections (p < 0.001) and within a single collection (p = 0.01), although this relationship was not significant for δ(15)N and δ(34)S. We made several other qualitative inferences with respect to the feeding biology of the taxa occurring in these lower slope seeps, some of which have not been described prior to this study."
https://openalex.org/W2043876953,"Oxidative stress-mediated neuronal dysfunction is characteristic of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the formation of L-DOPA, the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of dopamine. A lack of dopamine in the striatum is the most characteristic feature of PD, and the cause of the most dominant symptoms. Loss of function mutations in the PTEN-induced putative kinase (PINK1) gene cause autosomal recessive PD. This study explored the basic mechanisms underlying the involvement of pink1 in oxidative stress-mediated PD pathology using zebrafish as a tool. We generated a transgenic line, Tg(pink1:EGFP), and used it to study the effect of oxidative stress (exposure to H2O2) on pink1 expression. GFP expression was enhanced throughout the brain of zebrafish larvae subjected to oxidative stress. In addition to a widespread increase in pink1 mRNA expression, mild oxidative stress induced a clear decline in tyrosine hydroxylase 2 (th2), but not tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) expression, in the brain of wild-type larvae. The drug L-Glutathione Reduced (LGR) has been associated with anti-oxidative and possible neuroprotective properties. Administration of LGR normalized the increased fluorescence intensity indicating pink1 transgene expression and endogenous pink1 mRNA expression in larvae subjected to oxidative stress by H2O2. In the pink1 morpholino oliogonucleotide-injected larvae, the reduction in the expression of th1 and th2 was partially rescued by LGR. The pink1 gene is a sensitive marker of oxidative stress in zebrafish, and LGR effectively normalizes the consequences of mild oxidative stress, suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of pink1 and LGR may be significant and useful in drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2092118314,"Background Combined oral contraceptive (COC) use is the most commonly used reversible method of birth control. The incorrect use of COCs is frequent and one of the most common causes of unintended pregnancies. Community pharmacists (CPs) are in a strategic position to improve COC use because they are the last health professional to interact with patients before drug use. Objective To evaluate the COC dispensing practices of CPs in a developing country. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in community pharmacies of Assis and Ourinhos microregions, Brazil, between June 1, 2012, and October 30, 2012. Four simulated patients (SPs) (with counseled audio recording) visited community pharmacies with a prescription for Ciclo 21® (a COC containing ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg + levonorgestrel 15 mcg). The audio recording of every SP visit was listened to independently by 3 researchers to evaluate the COC dispensing practice. The percentage of CPs who performed a screening for safe use of COCs (i.e., taking of patients’ medical and family history, and measuring of blood pressure) and provided counseling, as well as the quality of the screening and counseling, were evaluated. Results Of the 185 CPs contacted, 41 (22.2%) agreed to participate in the study and finished the study protocol. Only 3 CPs asked the SP a question (1 question asked by each professional), and all of the questions were closed-ended, viz., “do you smoke?” (n = 2) and “what is your age?” (n = 1). None of the CPs measured the patient’s blood pressure. Six CPs provided counseling when dispensing COCs (drug dosing, 5 CPs; possible adverse effects, 2 CPs), and one CP provided counseling regarding both aspects. Conclusion The CPs evaluated did not dispense COC appropriately and could influence in the occurrence of negatives therapeutic outcomes such as adverse effects and treatment failure."

Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to compare sepsis mortality (ICD-10 A40-41) to inadequate exercise (<1.07 METh/d run or walked) as measured on their baseline questionnaires. Deaths occurring within one year of the baseline survey were excluded.Sepsis was the underlying cause in 54 deaths (sepsis(underlying)) and a contributing cause in 184 deaths (sepsis(contributing)), or 238 total sepsis-related deaths (sepsis(total)). Inadequate exercise was associated with 2.24-fold increased risk for sepsis(underlying) (95%CI: 1.21 to 4.07-fold, P = 0.01), 2.11-fold increased risk for sepsis(contributing) (95%CI: 1.51- to 2.92-fold, P<10(-4)), and 2.13-fold increased risk for sepsis(total) (95%CI: 1.59- to 2.84-fold, P<10(-6)) when adjusted for age, sex, race, and cohort. The risk increase did not differ significantly between runners and walkers, by sex, or by age. Sepsis(total) risk was greater in diabetics (P = 10(-5)), cancer survivors (P = 0.0001), and heart attack survivors (P = 0.003) and increased with waist circumference (P = 0.0004).

CMV-, EBV- and ADV-specific T cells were enumerated in 170 G-CSF-mobilized stem cell and 24 non-mobilized platelet donors using 14 HLA-matched multimers.

Clinical follow up data indicate that the first CMV-reactivation in patients and with it the need for T-cell transfer occurs while the donor is still under the influence of G-CSF. To overcome these limitations, T-cell banking before mobilization or recruitment of third party donors might be an option to optimize T-cell production."
https://openalex.org/W2118447522,"The generation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) during development is a complex process linked to morphogenic signals. Understanding this process is important for regenerative medicine applications that require in vitro production of HSC. In this study we investigated the effects of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling during early embryonic differentiation and hematopoietic specification using an embryonic stem cell system. Our data clearly demonstrates that following early differentiation induction, canonical Wnt signaling induces a strong mesodermal program whilst maintaining a degree of stemness potential. This involved a complex interplay between β-catenin/TCF/LEF/Brachyury/Nanog. β-catenin mediated up-regulation of TCF/LEF resulted in enhanced brachyury levels, which in-turn lead to Nanog up-regulation. During differentiation, active canonical Wnt signaling also up-regulated key transcription factors and cell specific markers essential for hematopoietic specification, in particular genes involved in establishing primitive erythropoiesis. This led to a significant increase in primitive erythroid colony formation. β-catenin signaling also augmented early hematopoietic and multipotent progenitor (MPP) formation. Following culture in a MPP specific cytokine cocktail, activation of β-catenin suppressed differentiation of the early hematopoietic progenitor population, with cells displaying a higher replating capacity and a propensity to form megakaryocytic erythroid progenitors. This bias towards erythroid lineage commitment was also observed when hematopoietic progenitors were directed to undergo myeloid colony formation. Overall this study underscores the importance of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mesodermal specification, primitive erythropoiesis and early hematopietic progenitor formation during hematopoietic induction."

https://openalex.org/W2076682904,"Adiponectin has been shown to have beneficial cardiovascular effects and to signal through the adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. The original aim of this study was to investigate the effect of combined AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 deficiency (AdipoR1-/-AdipoR2-/-) on atherosclerosis. However, we made the interesting observation that AdipoR1-/-AdipoR2-/- leads to embryonic lethality demonstrating the critical importance of the adiponectin signalling system during development. We then investigated the effect of AdipoR2-ablation on the progression of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. AdipoR2-/-ApoE-/- mice fed an atherogenic diet had decreased plaque area in the brachiocephalic artery compared with AdipoR2+/+ApoE-/- littermate controls as visualized in vivo using an ultrasound biomicroscope and confirmed by histological analyses. The decreased plaque area in the brachiocephalic artery could not be explained by plasma cholesterol levels or inflammatory status. However, accumulation of neutral lipids was decreased in peritoneal macrophages from AdipoR2-/-ApoE-/- mice after incubation with oxidized LDL. This effect was associated with lower CD36 and higher ABCA1 mRNA levels in peritoneal macrophages from AdipoR2-/-ApoE-/- mice compared with AdipoR2+/+ApoE-/- controls after incubation with oxidized LDL. In summary, we show that adiponectin receptors are crucial during embryonic development and that AdipoR2-deficiency slows down the progression of atherosclerosis in the brachiocephalic artery of ApoE-deficient mice."

Three of them, including USP37, contain ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), an ∼20-amino acid α-helical stretch that binds to ubiquitin. However, the roles of the UIMs in these USP enzymes remain unknown. USP37 has three UIMs, designated here as UIMs 1, 2, and 3 from the N-terminal side, between the Cys and His boxes comprising the catalytic core. Here, we examined the role of the UIMs in USP37 using its mutants that harbor mutations in the UIMs. The nuclear localization of USP37 was not affected by the UIM mutations. However, mutations in UIM2 or UIM3, but not UIM1, resulted in a significant decrease in USP37 binding to ubiquitinated proteins in the cell. In vitro, a region of USP37 harboring the three UIMs also bound to both Lys(48)-linked and Lys(63)-linked ubiquitin chains in a UIM2- and UIM3-dependent manner. The level of USP37 ubiquitination was also reduced by mutations in UIM2 or UIM3, suggesting their role in ubiquitination of USP37 itself. Finally, mutants lacking functional UIM2 or UIM3 exhibited a reduced isopeptidase activity toward ubiquitinated proteins in the cell and both Lys(48)-linked and Lys(63)-linked ubiquitin chains. These results suggested that the UIMs in USP37 contribute to the full enzymatic activity, but not ubiquitin chain substrate specificity, of USP37 possibly by holding the ubiquitin chain substrate in the proximity of the catalytic core."
https://openalex.org/W2028219488,"Degradation of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy is an essential process to ensure cell homeostasis. Because neurons, which have a high energy demand, are particularly dependent on the mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy represents a key mechanism to ensure correct neuronal function. Collapsin response mediator proteins 5 (CRMP5) belongs to a family of cytosolic proteins involved in axon guidance and neurite outgrowth signaling during neural development. CRMP5, which is highly expressed during brain development, plays an important role in the regulation of neuronal polarity by inhibiting dendrite outgrowth at early developmental stages. Here, we demonstrated that CRMP5 was present in vivo in brain mitochondria and is targeted to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial localization of CRMP5 induced mitophagy. CRMP5 overexpression triggered a drastic change in mitochondrial morphology, increased the number of lysosomes and double membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes, and enhanced the occurrence of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) at the mitochondrial level. Moreover, the lipidated form of LC3, LC3-II, which triggers autophagy by insertion into autophagosomes, enhanced mitophagy initiation. Lysosomal marker translocates at the mitochondrial level, suggesting autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and induced the reduction of mitochondrial content via lysosomal degradation. We show that during early developmental stages the strong expression of endogenous CRMP5, which inhibits dendrite growth, correlated with a decrease of mitochondrial content. In contrast, the knockdown or a decrease of CRMP5 expression at later stages enhanced mitochondrion numbers in cultured neurons, suggesting that CRMP5 modulated these numbers. Our study elucidates a novel regulatory mechanism that utilizes CRMP5-induced mitophagy to orchestrate proper dendrite outgrowth and neuronal function."

By phage display screening, M13 phage was found to strongly bind sulfur particles. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements indicated that the strong sulfur-binding ability of M13 phage derives from newly generated S-O and C-S bonds. Using this phage assembled sulfur composite in a lithium battery, the first discharge capacity reached 1117 mAh g-1, which is more than twice that of the sulfur only cathode. Besides, the negative polysulfide shuttle effect in a lithium-sulfur battery was significantly suppressed."
https://openalex.org/W1988105413,"We have recently established a culture system to study the impact of simulated microgravity on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) development. We subjected mouse and human OPCs to a short exposure of simulated microgravity produced by a 3D-Clinostat robot. Our results demonstrate that rodent and human OPCs display enhanced and sustained proliferation when exposed to simulated microgravity as assessed by several parameters, including a decrease in the cell cycle time. Additionally, OPC migration was examined in vitro using time-lapse imaging of cultured OPCs. Our results indicated that OPCs migrate to a greater extent after stimulated microgravity than in normal conditions, and this enhanced motility was associated with OPC morphological changes. The lack of normal gravity resulted in a significant increase in the migration speed of mouse and human OPCs and we found that the average leading process in migrating bipolar OPCs was significantly longer in microgravity treated cells than in controls, demonstrating that during OPC migration the lack of gravity promotes leading process extension, an essential step in the process of OPC migration. Finally, we tested the effect of simulated microgravity on OPC differentiation. Our data showed that the expression of mature oligodendrocyte markers was significantly delayed in microgravity treated OPCs. Under conditions where OPCs were allowed to progress in the lineage, simulated microgravity decreased the proportion of cells that expressed mature markers, such as CC1 and MBP, with a concomitant increased number of cells that retained immature oligodendrocyte markers such as Sox2 and NG2. Development of methodologies aimed at enhancing the number of OPCs and their ability to progress on the oligodendrocyte lineage is of great value for treatment of demyelinating disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the gravitational modulation of oligodendrocyte intrinsic plasticity to increase their progenies."
https://openalex.org/W2063310879,"Aerosolized or aspirated manufactured carbon nanotubes have been shown to be cytotoxic, cause pulmonary lesions, and demonstrate immunomodulatory properties. CD-1 mice were used to assess pulmonary toxicity of helical carbon nanotubes (HCNTs) and alterations of the immune response to subsequent infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. HCNTs provoked a mild inflammatory response following either a single exposure or 2X/week for three weeks (multiple exposures) but were not significantly toxic. Administering HCNTs 2X/week for three weeks resulted in pulmonary lesions including granulomas and goblet cell hyperplasia. Mice exposed to HCNTs and subsequently infected by P. aeruginosa demonstrated an enhanced inflammatory response to P. aeruginosa and phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages was inhibited. However, clearance of P. aeruginosa was not affected. HCNT exposed mice depleted of neutrophils were more effective in clearing P. aeruginosa compared to neutrophil-depleted control mice, accompanied by an influx of macrophages. Depletion of systemic macrophages resulted in slightly inhibited bacterial clearance by HCNT treated mice. Our data indicate that pulmonary exposure to HCNTs results in lesions similar to those caused by other nanotubes and pre-exposure to HCNTs inhibit alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa. However, clearance was not affected as exposure to HCNTs primed the immune system for an enhanced inflammatory response to pulmonary infection consisting of an influx of neutrophils and macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2022527135,"Acknowledgment of all serious limitations to research evidence is important for patient care and scientific progress. Formal research on how biomedical authors acknowledge limitations is scarce.To assess the extent to which limitations are acknowledged in biomedical publications explicitly, and implicitly by investigating the use of phrases that express uncertainty, so-called hedges; to assess the association between industry support and the extent of hedging.We analyzed reporting of limitations and use of hedges in 300 biomedical publications published in 30 high and medium -ranked journals in 2007. Hedges were assessed using linguistic software that assigned weights between 1 and 5 to each expression of uncertainty.Twenty-seven percent of publications (81/300) did not mention any limitations, while 73% acknowledged a median of 3 (range 1-8) limitations. Five percent mentioned a limitation in the abstract. After controlling for confounders, publications on industry-supported studies used significantly fewer hedges than publications not so supported (p = 0.028).Detection and classification of limitations was--to some extent--subjective. The weighting scheme used by the hedging detection software has subjective elements.Reporting of limitations in biomedical publications is probably very incomplete. Transparent reporting of limitations may protect clinicians and guideline committees against overly confident beliefs and decisions and support scientific progress through better design, conduct or analysis of new studies."
https://openalex.org/W2065924068,"There is increasing evidence that many solid tumors are hierarchically organized with the bulk tumor cells having limited replication potential, but are sustained by a stem-like cell that perpetuates the tumor. These cancer stem cells have been hypothesized to originate from transformation of adult tissue stem cells, or through re-acquisition of stem-like properties by progenitor cells. Adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) is an aggressive type of lung cancer that contains a mixture of cells with squamous (cytokeratin 5+) and adenocarcinoma (cytokeratin 7+) phenotypes. The origin of these mixtures is unclear as squamous carcinomas are thought to arise from basal cells in the upper respiratory tract while adenocarcinomas are believed to form from stem cells in the bronchial alveolar junction. We have isolated and characterized cancer stem-like populations from ASC through application of selective defined culture medium initially used to grow human lung stem cells. Homogeneous cells selected from ASC tumor specimens were stably expanded in vitro. Primary xenografts and metastatic lesions derived from these cells in NSG mice fully recapitulate both the adenocarcinoma and squamous features of the patient tumor. Interestingly, while the CSLC all co-expressed cytokeratins 5 and 7, most xenograft cells expressed either one, or neither, with <10% remaining double positive. We also demonstrated the potential of the CSLC to differentiate to multi-lineage structures with branching lung morphology expressing bronchial, alveolar and neuroendocrine markers in vitro. Taken together the properties of these ASC-derived CSLC suggests that ASC may arise from a primitive lung stem cell distinct from the bronchial-alveolar or basal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2091706522,"Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic in South Africa however, there is limited data on the degree of liver disease and geographic variation in HIV/HBV coinfected individuals. In this study, we analysed data from the CIPRA-SA ‘Safeguard the household study’ in order to assess baseline HBV characteristics in HIV/HBV co-infection participants prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Methods 812 participants from two South African townships Soweto and Masiphumelele were enrolled in a randomized trial of ART (CIPRA-SA). Participants were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA. FIB-4 scores were calculated at baseline. Results Forty-eight (5.9%) were HBsAg positive, of whom 28 (58.3%) were HBeAg positive. Of those with HBV, 29.8% had an HBV DNA<2000 IU/ml and ALT<40 IU/ml ; 83.0% had a FIB-4 score <1.45, consistent with absent or minimal liver disease. HBV prevalence was 8.5% in Masiphumelele compared to 3.8% in Soweto (relative risk 2.3; 95% CI: 1.3–4.0). More participants in Masiphumelele had HBeAg-negative disease (58% vs. 12%, p = 0.002) and HBV DNA levels ≤2000 IU/ml, (43% vs. 6% p<0.007). Conclusion One third of HIV/HBV co-infected subjects had low HBV DNA levels and ALT while the majority had indicators of only mild liver disease. There were substantial regional differences in HBsAg and HbeAg prevalence in HIV/HBV co-infection between two regions in South Africa. This study highlights the absence of severe liver disease and the marked regional differences in HIV/HBV co-infection in South Africa and will inform treatment decisions in these populations."
https://openalex.org/W2030183967,"Microscopic analysis of tumor vasculature plays an important role in understanding the progression and malignancy of colorectal carcinoma. However, due to the geometry of blood vessels and their connections, standard microtome-based histology is limited in providing the spatial information of the vascular network with a 3-dimensional (3-D) continuum. To facilitate 3-D tissue analysis, we prepared transparent human colorectal biopsies by optical clearing for in-depth confocal microscopy with CD34 immunohistochemistry. Full-depth colons were obtained from colectomies performed for colorectal carcinoma. Specimens were prepared away from (control) and at the tumor site. Taking advantage of the transparent specimens, we acquired anatomic information up to 200 μm in depth for qualitative and quantitative analyses of the vasculature. Examples are given to illustrate: (1) the association between the tumor microstructure and vasculature in space, including the perivascular cuffs of tumor outgrowth, and (2) the difference between the 2-D and 3-D quantitation of microvessels. We also demonstrate that the optically cleared mucosa can be retrieved after 3-D microscopy to perform the standard microtome-based histology (H&E staining and immunohistochemistry) for systematic integration of the two tissue imaging methods. Overall, we established a new tumor histological approach to integrate 3-D imaging, illustration, and quantitation of human colonic microvessels in normal and cancerous specimens. This approach has significant promise to work with the standard histology to better characterize the tumor microenvironment in colorectal carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2040859555,"The lateral dynamics of proteins and lipids in the mammalian plasma membrane are heterogeneous likely reflecting both a complex molecular organization and interactions with other macromolecules that reside outside the plane of the membrane. Several methods are commonly used for characterizing the lateral dynamics of lipids and proteins. These experimental and data analysis methods differ in equipment requirements, labeling complexities, and further oftentimes give different results. It would therefore be very convenient to have a single method that is flexible in the choice of fluorescent label and labeling densities from single molecules to ensemble measurements, that can be performed on a conventional wide-field microscope, and that is suitable for fast and accurate analysis. In this work we show that k-space image correlation spectroscopy (kICS) analysis, a technique which was originally developed for analyzing lateral dynamics in samples that are labeled at high densities, can also be used for fast and accurate analysis of single molecule density data of lipids and proteins labeled with quantum dots (QDs). We have further used kICS to investigate the effect of the label size and by comparing the results for a biotinylated lipid labeled at high densities with Atto647N-strepatvidin (sAv) or sparse densities with sAv-QDs. In this latter case, we see that the recovered diffusion rate is two-fold greater for the same lipid and in the same cell-type when labeled with Atto647N-sAv as compared to sAv-QDs. This data demonstrates that kICS can be used for analysis of single molecule data and furthermore can bridge between samples with a labeling densities ranging from single molecule to ensemble level measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1983909316,"Among the various subtypes of the M group of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), clade CRF07_BC is the most prevalent in China. To date, no strong replicable CRF07_BC infectious clone has been constructed. Here we report on the construction and characterization of highly replicable infectious molecular clones from the isolate XJDC6291 of this HIV-1 subtype. Four full-length clones pXJDC2-7, pXJDC3-7, pXJDC2-6 and pXJDC3-6 were successfully produced, but only pXJDC2-7 presented detectable infectivity and replication capability. To improve the replication capability of pXJDC2-7, a 4.8 kb region spanning from the pol Integrase to nef gene of the clone was replaced by PCR products of the corresponding fragments from the original isolate XJDC6291, which produced two clones pXJDC13 and pXJDC17 that exhibited strong replication capability. The viral stocks obtained by pXJDC-13 and pXJDC-17 transfection into 293T cells replicated efficiently in human PBMCs, human primary CD4+ T cells and displayed CCR5 tropism. Sequence alignment between pXJDC13, pXJDC17 and pXJDC2-7 suggested that polymorphisms in the V1V2 region may influence infectivity, and reverse genetic experiment showed that V1V2 polymorphisms may influence the infectivity of the clones but did not affect the replication capability at a significant level. pXJDC13 and pXJDC17 displayed strong replication capability and are the first full-length infectious clones of HIV-1 CRF07_BC clade in the world. The availability of CRF07_BC infectious clones provides a useful tool for a wide range of studies, including antiretroviral drug and vaccine research as related to this HIV subtype."
https://openalex.org/W1985781202,"SEL1L, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, has been reported to regulate the (i) differentiation of the pancreatic endocrine and exocrine tissue during the second transition of mouse embryonic development, (ii) neural stem cell self-renewal and lineage commitment and (iii) cell cycle progression through regulation of genes related to cell-matrix interaction. Here we show that in the pancreas the expression of SEL1L is developmentally regulated, such that it is readily detected in developing islet cells and in nascent acinar clusters adjacent to basement membranes, and becomes progressively restricted to the islets of Langherans in post-natal life. This peculiar expression pattern and the presence of two inverse RGD motifs in the fibronectin type II domain of SEL1L protein indicate a possible interaction with cell adhesion molecules to regulate islets architecture. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed SEL1L and ß1-integrin interaction and, down-modulation of SEL1L in pancreatic ß-cells, negatively influences both cell adhesion on selected matrix components and cell proliferation likely due to altered ERK signaling. Furthermore, the absence of SEL1L protein strongly inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated mouse pancreatic islets unveiling an important role of SEL1L in insulin trafficking. This phenotype can be rescued by the ectopic expression of the ß1-integrin subunit confirming the close interaction of these two proteins in regulating the cross-talk between extracellular matrix and insulin signalling to create a favourable micro-environment for ß-cell development and function."
https://openalex.org/W2025323290,"Background Thyroid hormones (TH) regulate cholesterol metabolism but their use as lipid-lowering drugs is restricted due to negative cardiac effects. TH mimetic compounds modulating TH receptor β (THRβ) have been designed as potential drugs, reducing serum cholesterol levels while avoiding apparent deleterious cardiac effects. Objective Using ApoE deficient mice, we examined whether KB3495, a TH mimetic compound, reduces atherosclerosis and if there is a synergistic effect with atorvastatin. The effect of KB3495 was investigated after 10 and 25 weeks. Results KB3495 treatment reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation in aorta and decreased the cholesteryl ester (CE) content by 57%. Treatment with KB3495 was also associated with a reduction of macrophage content in the atherosclerotic plaques and reduced serum levels of IL-1β, TNFalpha, IL-6, Interferon γ, MCP-1 and M-CSF. Serum lipoprotein analysis showed no change in total cholesterol levels in ApoB-containing lipoproteins. KB3495 alone increased fecal BA excretion by 90%. The excretion of neutral sterols increased in all groups, with the largest increase in the combination group (350%). After 25 weeks, the animals treated with KB3495 showed 50% lower CE levels in the skin and even further reductions were observed in the combination group where the CE levels were reduced by almost 95% as compared to controls. Conclusion KB3495 treatment reduced atherosclerosis independently of total cholesterol levels in ApoB-containing lipoproteins likely by stimulation of sterol excretion from the body and by inhibition of the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1998232720,"The generation of long-term memory for motor skills can be modulated by subsequent motor experiences that interfere with the consolidation process. Recent studies suggest that even a non-motor task may adversely affect some aspects of motor sequence memory. Here we show that motor sequence memory can be either enhanced or reduced, by different cognitive tasks. Participants were trained in performing finger movement sequences. Fully explicit instructions about the target sequence were given before practice. The buildup of procedural knowledge was tested at three time-points: immediately before training (T1), after practice (T2), and 24 hours later (T3). Each participant performed the task on two separate occasions; training on a different movement sequence on each occasion. In one condition, interference, participants performed a non-motor task immediately after T2. Half the participants solved simple math problems and half performed a simple semantic judgment task. In the baseline condition there was no additional task. All participants improved significantly between T1 and T2 (within-session gains). In addition, in the baseline condition, performance significantly improved between T2 and T3 (delayed 'off-line' gains). Solving math problems significantly enhanced these delayed gains in motor performance, whereas performing semantic decisions significantly reduced delayed gains compared to baseline. Thus, procedural motor memory consolidation can be either enhanced or inhibited by subsequent cognitive experiences. These effects do not require explicit or implicit new learning. The retrieval of unrelated, non-motor, well established knowledge can modulate procedural memory."
https://openalex.org/W1976829091,"We propose a method to model the physiological link between somatic survival and reproductive output that reduces the number of parameters that need to be estimated by models designed to determine combinations of birth and death rates that produce historic counts of animal populations. We applied our Reproduction and Somatic Survival Linked (RSSL) method to the population counts of three species of North Pacific pinnipeds (harbor seals, Phoca vitulina richardii (Gray, 1864); northern fur seals, Callorhinus ursinus (L., 1758); and Steller sea lions, Eumetopias jubatus (Schreber, 1776))—and found our model outperformed traditional models when fitting vital rates to common types of limited datasets, such as those from counts of pups and adults. However, our model did not perform as well when these basic counts of animals were augmented with additional observations of ratios of juveniles to total non-pups. In this case, the failure of the ratios to improve model performance may indicate that the relationship between survival and reproduction is redefined or disassociated as populations change over time or that the ratio of juveniles to total non-pups is not a meaningful index of vital rates. Overall, our RSSL models show advantages to linking survival and reproduction within models to estimate the vital rates of pinnipeds and other species that have limited time-series of counts."
https://openalex.org/W2136445897,"Microtubule inhibitors are invaluable tools in cancer chemotherapy: taxanes and vinca alkaloids have been successfully used in the clinic over the past thirty years against a broad range of tumors. However, two factors have limited the effectiveness of microtubule inhibitors: toxicity and resistance. In particular, the latter is highly unpredictable, variable from patient to patient and is believed to be the cause of treatment failure in most cases of metastatic cancers. For these reasons, there is an increasing demand for new microtubule inhibitors that can overcome resistance mechanisms and that, at the same time, have reduced side effects. Here we present a novel microtubule inhibitor, 4SC-207, which shows strong anti-proliferative activity in a large panel of tumor cell lines with an average GI50 of 11nM. In particular, 4SC-207 is active in multi-drug resistant cell lines, such as HCT-15 and ACHN, suggesting that it is a poor substrate for drug efflux pumps. 4SC-207 inhibits microtubule growth in vitro and in vivo and promotes, in a dose dependent manner, a mitotic delay/arrest, followed by apoptosis or aberrant divisions due to chromosome alignment defects and formation of multi-polar spindles. Furthermore, preliminary data from preclinical studies suggest low propensity towards bone marrow toxicities at concentrations that inhibit tumor growth in paclitaxel-resistant xenograft models. In summary, our results suggest that 4SC-207 may be a potential anti-cancer agent."
