https://openalex.org/W2091689950,"The distribution of lead-210 which enters the oceans subsequent to its production in the atmosphere by radon-222 decay, shows an increase with depth in sea water. By use of a simplified two-layer model of the ocean, a residence time of lead in the upper mixed layer of less than 2 years is derived. It is suggested that the marine biosphere is responsible for the conveyance of lead from surface to deeper waters. The distribution of lead-210 in the Colorado River indicated a rapid removal along the path from its origin in the feed waters to the reservoir at Lake Mead."

Since no physical barriers prevent interchange between various portions of the study colony, it is concluded that intrinsic factors play the major role in limiting movement. The few available data on dispersal are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2072306643,"The demonstrated association of the d-c bioelectric field with central nervous system elements implies the longitudinal flow of charge carriers within that system. Transverse d-c voltages, attributed to the Hall effect, have been obtained from the extremities of intact salamanders under circumstances suggesting such electric current. These voltages disappeared after nerve section, and their magnitude was related to the depth of anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W1991684876,"In the past, confusion has resulted from the use of relative expressions indicative of the direction of temperature change, rather than positive identification of warm and cool sensations. Data are presented which show that at more extreme skin temperatures sudden changes in temperature may result in two readily discernible sensations. The occurrence of each sensation depends upon the magnitude of the change."

Only the three common haptoglobin phenotypes were observed, but a high percentage of a new faster-moving transferrin variant B(0-1) was discovered. No unusual ceruloplasmins were found."

https://openalex.org/W1971044341,A small amount of hypoxanthine is formed when a solution of adenine is irradiated. This has been detected by using C14-labeled adenine and the techniques of paper chromatography and liquid-scintillation counting. The biological significance of this conversion is suggested.
https://openalex.org/W2055574947,"Patterns of discharge in slowly adapting, spontaneously discharging neurons of the cochlear nucleus were studied. A technique for analyzing the distribution of intervals between discharges of neurons is described. The response to a steady tone generally was an irregularly spaced train of impulses. In the majority of cells examined, the intervals between discharges were distributed exponentially. The mean interval and standard deviation of the distributions decreased as the level of afferent excitation was increased, but the modal value of the distribution was unchanged."

https://openalex.org/W1971516708,Tritium in Arabian rainfall has followed the trend observed in North America with peaks in 1958 and the spring of 1959. These measurements will be useful for future hydrologic studies. Water from wadi gravels averages 10 yr old. Carbon-14 measurements of deep waters indicate ages of several thousand years.

https://openalex.org/W2158923241,"Zinc-65 has been found in small amounts in muscle and liver samples obtained from cattle raised in Nevada, and also in commercial hamburger and beef liver from the southwestern area. Zirconium-95 and niobium-95 were found in the liver samples but not in the muscle or hamburger. A trace of zinc-65 was detected in milk buLt none in people."

https://openalex.org/W2084276823,"The absorption of glucose flavazole was measured in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum. Three maxima were observed: 267, 335, and 410 mmicro. The absorption at 410 mmicro follows Beer's law with 70 percent propanol or water as solvent. The molar absorptivities for glucose, maltose, and lactose flavazoles were the same and equal to 3.7 x 10(3)."
https://openalex.org/W2124243879,"The genetic distinction between the nonspotted, or burnsi, mutant and the common-spotted, wild-type leopard frog is not simply unifactorial. The burnsi phenotype is a manifestation of genic interaction between a major pigmentary locus and a complex of modifiers (minor genes with small effects)."

Female mice similarly treated were not protected."

https://openalex.org/W2053284917,"An outer membrane surface is assumed to take up potassium ions in a manner analogous to adsorption. This model, already successful in predicting transmembrane flux, is shown to predict also an asymmetrical potential-time relation depending on the direction of the concentration changes. The results may have some value in explaining recent observations of similar effects in muscle."
