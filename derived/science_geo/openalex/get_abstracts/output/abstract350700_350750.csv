https://openalex.org/W2059246452,"To identify novel methylated gene promoters, we compared differential RNA expression profiles of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with or without treatment of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). Out of 1776 genes that were initially 'absent (that is, silenced)' by gene expression array analysis, we selected 163 genes that were increased after 5-aza-dC treatment in at least two of three CRC cell lines. The microarray results were confirmed by Reverse Transcription-PCR, and CpG island of the gene promoters were amplified and sequenced for examination of cancer-specific methylation. Among the genes identified, the deafness, autosomal dominant 5 gene, DFNA5, promoter was found to be methylated in primary tumor tissues with high frequency (65%, 65/100). Quantitative methylation-specific PCR of DFNA5 clearly discriminated primary CRC tissues from normal colon tissues (3%, 3/100). The mRNA expression of DFNA5 in four of five colon cancer tissues was significantly downregulated as compared to normal tissues. Moreover, forced expression of full-length DFNA5 in CRC cell lines markedly decreased the cell growth and colony-forming ability whereas knockdown of DFNA5 increased cell growth in culture. Our data implicate DFNA5 as a novel tumor suppressor gene in CRC and a valuable molecular marker for human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2080729278,"p53 missense mutant proteins commonly show increased stability compared to wild-type p53, which is thought to depend largely on the inability of mutant p53 to induce the ubiquitin ligase MDM2. However, recent work using mouse models has shown that the accumulation of mutant p53 occurs only in tumour cells, indicating that stabilization requires additional factors. To clarify the stabilization of p53 mutants in tumours, we analysed factors that affect their folding and degradation. Although all missense mutants that we studied are more stable than wild-type p53, the levels correlate with individual structural characteristics, which may be reflected in different gain-of-function properties. In the absence of Hsp90 activity, the less stable unfolded p53 mutants preferentially associate in a complex with Hsp70 and CHIP (carboxy terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein), and we show that CHIP is responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of these mutants. The demonstration of a complex interplay between Hsp90, Hsp70 and CHIP that regulate the stability of different p53 mutant proteins improves our understanding of the pro-tumorigenic effects of increased Hsp90 activity during multi-stage carcinogenesis. Understanding the roles of Hsp90, Hsp70 and CHIP in cancers may also provide an important avenue through which to target p53 to enhance treatment of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1997638561,"Decitabine (DAC) and 5-azacitidine have recently been approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. The pharmacodynamic effects of DAC and 5-azacitidine outside their known activity as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) require further investigation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DAC on the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, a gene with a putative CpG island surrounding its promoter region. Promoter methylation analysis of p21WAF1/CIP1 in leukemia cells revealed the absence of CpG methylation. However, DAC upregulated p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (ED50=103.34 nM) and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in leukemia cells. Sequential application of DAC followed by different histone deacetylase inhibitors induced expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 synergistically. Upregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 paralleled DAC-induced apoptosis (ED50=153 nM). Low doses of DAC induced γ-H2AX expression (ED50=16.5 nM) and upregulated p21WAF1/CIP1 in congenic HCT 116 colon cancer cells in a DNMT-independent and p53-dependent fashion. Inhibition of p53 transactivation by pifithrin-α or the kinase activity of ATM by either the specific ATM inhibitor KU-5593 or caffeine abrogated p21WAF1/CIP1 upregulation, indicating that DAC upregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 was p53- and ATM-dependent in leukemia cells. In conclusion, DAC upregulates p21WAF1/CIP1 in DNMT-independent manner via the DNA damage/ATM/p53 axis."

https://openalex.org/W2005528673,"Prostate cancer is one of the most prominent malignancies of elderly men in many Western countries including Europe and the United States with increasing trend worldwide. The growth of normal prostate as well as of prostate carcinoma cells depends on functional androgen receptor (AR) signaling. AR manifests the biological actions of androgens and its transcriptional activity is known to be influenced by signal transduction pathways. Here we show that Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed in androgen-independent prostate carcinoma C4-2 cells. Interestingly, the expression of Src was found to progressively increase (up to threefold) in transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate mice as a function of age and cancer progression. Blocking Src kinase function by a specific inhibitor, PP2, resulted in decreased AR transactivation function on two different reporters, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Consistent with this, overexpression of a functional Src mutant also led to a dramatic decrease in AR transactivation potential in a hormone-dependent manner. Interference with Src function in C4-2 cells led to decreased recruitment of AR on the target gene PSA enhancer and also resulted in the abrogation of hormone-dependent PSA transcript induction. Src inhibition also led to a dramatic decrease in the cell invasion in addition to decreasing the cellular growth. We suggest that targeting Src kinase could be an effective strategy to inhibit prostate cancer growth and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2024116911,"The Runx family of transcription factors regulate cell growth and differentiation, and control the expression of target genes involved in cell fate decisions. We examined the role of the bone-related member of this family, Runx2, in regulating apoptosis via modulation of the Bcl2 family of genes in the osteosarcoma cell line Saos2. Our data demonstrate that Runx2 directly binds to two Runx-specific regulatory elements on the human bax promoter thereby inducing Bax expression. Furthermore, bone morphogenetic protein-induced or vector-mediated expression of Runx2 resulted in upregulation of Bax expression, and subsequent increased sensitivity of Saos2 cells to apoptosis. Finally, the observed upregulation of Bax expression and increased apoptosis were Runx2 dependent as Runx2 loss of function abrogated these effects. Our study provides the first evidence for Bax as a direct target of Runx2, suggesting that Runx2 may act as a proapoptotic factor in osteosarcoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W1984693768,"Overexpression of S100A7 (psoriasin), a small calcium-binding protein, has been associated with the development of psoriasis and carcinomas in different types of epithelia, but its precise functions are still unknown. Using human tissue specimens, cultured cell lines, and a mouse model, we found that S100A7 is highly expressed in preinvasive, well-differentiated and early staged human squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (SCCOC), but little or no expression was found in poorly differentiated, later-staged invasive tumors. Interestingly, our results showed that S100A7 inhibits both SCCOC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth/invasion in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that S100A7 is associated with the β-catenin complex, and inhibits β-catenin signaling by targeting β-catenin degradation via a noncanonical mechanism that is independent of GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation. More importantly, our results also indicated that β-catenin signaling negatively regulates S100A7 expression. Thus, this reciprocal negative regulation between S100A7 and β-catenin signaling implies their important roles in tumor development and progression. Despite its high levels of expression in early stage SCCOC tumorigenesis, S100A7 actually inhibits SCCOC tumor growth/invasion as well as tumor progression. Downregulation of S100A7 in later stages of tumorigenesis increases β-catenin signaling, leading to promotion of tumor growth and tumor progression."

https://openalex.org/W2074114723,"DEWAR1 has interpreted the chemistry of the mould metabolite, stipitatic acid, and of colchiceine (the methyl ether of which is the alkaloid colchicine) by postulating that they are derived from the hypothetical cycloheptatrienolone (I). This he termed 'tropolone', and he attributed to it quasi-aromatic character. This interesting suggestion, for which no tangible evidence was advanced2, has acquired more plausibility from the recent demonstration of Haworth, Moore and Pauson3 that purpurogallin is a trihydroxybenztropolone, as earlier suggested by Barltrop and Nicholson4, and from the finding of Erdtman and Gripenberg5 that the cedar-wood constituent γ-thujaplicin is an isopropyltropolone. Hitherto, a synthetic tropolone of established constitution has not been prepared, and the properties ascribed to such a structure have been based largely on speculation."

https://openalex.org/W1982640785,"STRONTIUM soaps of even-n fatty acids from caproic to stearic were examined by X-rays ; they exhibit several crystallographic forms. Form A is obtained by precipitation from an aqueous solution of a sodium soap ; the long spacings follow a law, d = 5·879 + 2·475 N, where N is the number of carbon atoms in the corresponding fatty acid. Form B follows a law, d = 3·95 + 2·447 N ; it can generally be obtained by heating A. The forms show a certain amount of variability of their powder patterns, the causes of which are not yet known. The increment of their long spacings indicates that in both forms the hydrocarbon-chain axes are perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the ionic sheet planes ; they differ in the structure of the ionic sheet or arrangement of the CH3 end-groups rather than in their angle of tilt. Strontium caproate and one sample of myristate gave patterns indicating the existence of further forms."

https://openalex.org/W1970789149,"GONADOTROPHINS resemble blood-group specific substances in several respects. Meyer1 has classified these compounds together as neutral mucoids ; Bussard and Eyquem2 claim to have demonstrated a serological relationship between blood-group substances and chorionic gonadotrophin. McShan and Meyer3 have observed inactivation of gonadotrophins by human saliva, whereas Schiff and Akune4 found that this material destroyed blood-group A substance. In addition, it has been shown that blood-group substances5,6 and serum gonadotrophin7 are substrates of the receptor-destroying enzyme produced by Vibrio choler"" and of the similar enzymic component of influenza virus. It would appear, then, that gonadotrophins and blood-group substances have a similar structure and may be inactivated by the same enzymes. This hypothesis was further examined by studying the action on serum gonadotrophin of enzymes which decompose blood-group specific substances."

https://openalex.org/W2061364415,"DURING 1945, in connexion with experiments on thermionic emission from electrodes other than the cathode in small radio valves, we had occasion to make measurements on the quantity of free barium evaporated from the cathode, and also the amount actually adsorbed on or distributed in the barium–strontium oxide coating. In view of the theoretical importance of the latter in connexion with the electrical conductivity of the coating treated as a semi-conductor (investigated by D. A. Wright, whose results are at present in the course of publication), we feel that our results have become of more general interest. Previous measurements by Berdennikowa1 and Clausing2 did not distinguish between the barium in the cathode coating and that evaporated, while Prescott and Morrison3, who made the distinction, used cathodes with free nickel distributed through the coating and activated them in an unusual manner by heating in methane. This may have produced excess barium, which could alloy with the nickel in the coating."

https://openalex.org/W2013134718,"THE danger of neutrons on the human body arises from two factors : the slowing down of fast neutrons and the absorption of neutrons. In the case of thermal neutrons, only absorption can take place, either in hydrogen to form a deuteron with emission of a 2.2-MeV. γ-ray, or by nitrogen-14 to form a carbon, with the emission of a 0.7-MeV. proton. In a very complete paper on the subject, Mitchell1 finds that the ionization produced in the human body can be attributed half to the γ-rays of the latter reaction and half to the protons.
